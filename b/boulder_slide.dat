50|$|While Schunemunk, {{like many}} of the lesser {{mountains}} of the American East Coast, is relatively devoid of the usual mountaineering hazards, one fatality has occurred in the recent past. On May 22, 2002, a group of hikers was bushwhacking on a <b>boulder</b> <b>slide</b> on the southeastern side of the mountain, above Dark Hollow Brook. While ascending the slide, 76-year-old Nicholas Styranovski was struck in the head and killed when a boulder he was grasping became dislodged and fell down the mountainside. Two other hikers below were seriously injured when the boulder struck them.|$|E
60|$|Her head swung slowly round, and {{the shaking}} canvas filled; she {{gathered}} way, {{and when her}} deck slanted the <b>boulders</b> were <b>sliding</b> past abeam. Coming round again, she left them astern, and drove forward swiftly into clear and sheltered water. Ten minutes afterward they ran the headsails down, and Aynsley ran her gently on to the beach. There {{she would have to}} stop until Engineer Saltom finished his repairs.|$|R
50|$|At {{a clinic}} the doctors tell {{it might be}} MPD, but unsure until they know about her past. Pratap tells that once {{he was going to}} Shimla, when his car broke down and was forced to stay at Varuna's house, during which both fell in love. But once the car is fixed Pratap leaves as he is going to Simla for {{marriage}} approval but doesn't accept and returns to Varuna and get married, much to disapproval of Pratap's mother. After this Varuna frequently gets headaches and in night would dance to loud music. Once at a picnic a <b>boulder</b> <b>slides</b> down a cliff which triggers some childhood memories of Varuna and she screams. Her mother-in-law arranges a witch doctor believing Varuna is under Voodoo but is unsuccessful. Things become a bit better on holidays but at a party at home, Varuna drinks alcohol. The next day, Pratap leaves town for an emergency but after coming back finds someone is heavily drinking alcohol, but couldn't reach a conclusion. Then comes the night when Varuna goes out in the club and dances with Dilip.|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{fields of}} large {{boulders}} are common {{around the base}} of hills in the Atacama Desert. How these boulders are transported from nearby hillslopes is unclear given the lack of rainfall of the region. Here we document the central role of seismicity, not runoff, in transporting and smoothing > 1 ton boulders all across the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert. The generally granitoid boulders emerge as corestones on hillslopes at an erosion rate of 0. 1 – 1 m Ma− 1. Thereafter, physical and cosmogenic isotopic evidence suggests that <b>boulders</b> <b>slide</b> and bounce rather than roll down hills and onto adjacent flats. In the transport process, the largest boulders are split and the smaller ones are weathered to grus, narrowing average boulder mass to ~ 2 tons (12 Ma, making them among the oldest continuously exposed features on the Earth. Boulder rubbing is just one geologic feature among many in the Atacama that underscore the role that seismicity probably plays in shaping landscapes of the waterless worlds of the solar system...|$|R
50|$|Another example {{occurs during}} {{landslides}}. Most landslides {{do not involve}} this effect, but occasionally the frequency of vibrations caused by the landslide is optimal to cause the boulders to vibrate. In this case, feedback causes the <b>boulders</b> to <b>slide</b> much farther and more quickly than typical, which can pose an increased danger to those in their path. One notable feature of such a landslide is that it appears to resemble flowing water, or mud, and not the dry sliding rocks that they were seconds earlier.|$|R
40|$|KEY WORDS: Remote Sensing, GIS, Multicriteria and Landslide. Landslide is {{a sudden}} {{downward}} movement of rock or soil mass movements on slopes {{with or without}} true sliding. This sudden movement of slope forming material causes extensive damage to life and property. When a landslide occurs in an active communication network like Highway, Railways, etc., {{the results will be}} catastrophic. The Konkan Railway alignment was made mostly (28 % of total length) in deep Rock, Rock Soil cuttings which are underlain by traps. During rainy seasons these steep slopes without toe support, failure are occurred frequently. The common types of failures are <b>boulder</b> falls, <b>slides</b> and slump etc., which damages the railway track structure. Few occasions, it lead to fatal train accidents. Many times accidents due to landslides were averted by the active warning systems like Inclinometers, Boulder nets, Raksha Dagha unit, ACD systems but the vulnerability to slope failures still exists. So, it is necessary to implement suitable permanent site-specific control measures for the vulnerable cuttings to avoid any failures in the future. An area of 163. 6 sq. km is taken for the study in which nearly 22 km of Konkan railway alignment passes through number of cuttings, bridges and tunnels. The landslide hazard zonation is prepared by using Multicriteria analysis in ARC MAP-GIS software by preparing various thematic maps like soil, geology, geomorphology, drainage density, slope and land use etc. The output map is used to monitor and to implement the slope protection measures in the railway cuttings. The final output map contains landslide hazard zonation classes like High hazard, Medium Hazard and Low hazard, which gives the possibility of landslide occurrence in relative terms. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Alaska marmots live in polar {{habitats}} {{including the}} terrestrial tundra and mountain biomes. They are located at elevations of about 1000 m to 1250 m. They are {{often found in}} <b>boulder</b> fields, rock <b>slides</b> and outcrops, terminal moraines, and Talus slopes in Alpine tundra with herbaceous forage. They are often found on mountain slopes surrounding lakes, and are found less commonly away from a lake. To create their shelter Alaska marmots burrow into permafrost soil containing tundra vegetation, and within ten meters a rocky ledge serves as an observation post. Alaska marmots live in relatively permanent winter dens that serve as a marmot colonies’ shelter for at least twenty years. A colony is essentially several individual family burrows built {{in close proximity to}} one another. Their dark fur serves as a mild camouflage in their rocky environments. Wind is also very important to an Alaska marmot's habitat and climate because it removes annoying mosquitoes. If there are large amounts of mosquitoes in the area {{due to a lack of}} wind, marmots will actually remain in their dens until the climate changes and the number of mosquitoes decrease.|$|R
