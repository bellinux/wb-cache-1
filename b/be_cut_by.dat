5|$|In 1995 Beyoncé's father {{resigned}} {{from his job}} to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly {{to work on their}} first recording, only to <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.|$|E
5|$|In South Korea, {{damage was}} {{heaviest}} in South Gyeongsang Province, where 71people were killed. Damage was particularly heavy in Busan, {{as well in}} as Yecheon, Ulsan, and Daegu. In Busan, strong winds wrecked 11lifting cranes, each weighing about 900tons, which injured five people and killed two in one incident. Many shipyards in the region were closed, and initial reports estimated {{it would take a}} year to fully reopen the Busan port. The estimated damage to the Busan port was about $50million (USD), causing cargo capacity to <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> 20%. High waves turned a large ship on its side in Busan, and in Ulsan the waves knocked an offshore shipbuilding plant into a petroleum facility, damaging them both. Sixteen people were killed in Busan.|$|E

5|$|Paul was {{assigned}} {{to be on the}} Energy and Natural Resources, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and Small Business committees. Paul also formed the Senate Tea Party Caucus with Jim DeMint and Mike Lee as its inaugural members. His first legislative proposal was to cut $500billion from federal spending in one year. This proposal included cutting the Department of Education by 83percent and the United States Department of Homeland Security by 43percent, as well as folding the Department of Energy into the Department of Defense and eliminating the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Seven independent agencies would be eliminated and food stamps would <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> 30percent. Under Paul's proposal, defense spending would be reduced by 6.5percent and international aid would be eliminated. He later proposed a five-year budget plan intended to balance the budget.|$|E

25|$|Because the TMPs were {{a closed}} system, it allowed for {{recycling}} of heat, which cut oil considerably.

25|$|Based on ethnographic evidence, it {{is assumed}} that this kind of log could <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> the use of some {{primitive}} stone or iron tools, but mostly by the use of controlled fire. After the log was cut, it was transported (moved on wooden rollers) to the construction site. At the site, work generally had to start {{from the bottom of the}} hull and followed by shaping the hull sides.|$|E
25|$|Other {{economic}} {{activity in the}} district included timber getting from around 1817 with the government convict sawmill operating until about 1830 at the Pennant Hills Sawing Establishment at Barren Ridges (Epping). Timber was hauled to the Pennant Hills Wharf opened in 1817 at Ermington on the Parramatta River. Timber continued to <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> private contractors into the 20th century. The Pennant Hills blue metal quarry at Dundas was also active from the 1830s.|$|E
25|$|Materials used in vaults and vault doors {{have changed}} as well. The earlier vaults had steel doors, but because these could easily <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> torches, {{different}} materials were tried. Massive cast iron doors had more resistance to acetylene torches than steel. The modern preferred vault door material {{is the same}} concrete as used in the vault wall panels. It is usually clad in steel for cosmetic reasons.The vault is a storage to store money and many valuable materials submitted {{by the members of}} bank.|$|E

25|$|What Babbage remarked is that {{skilled workers}} {{typically}} spend {{parts of their}} time performing tasks that are below their skill level. If the labour process can be divided among several workers, labour costs may <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> assigning only high-skill tasks to high-cost workers, restricting other tasks to lower-paid workers. He {{also pointed out that}} training or apprenticeship can be taken as fixed costs; but that returns to scale are available by his approach of standardisation of tasks, therefore again favouring the factory system. His view of human capital was restricted to minimising the time period for recovery of training costs.|$|E
25|$|Some mines {{close to}} Croydon {{township}} failed around 1890 when the ore {{was found to}} <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> a wall of granite. However, rich discoveries in 1891 at the Golden Gate reef to the northwest compensated for this. The 1890s {{proved to be the}} most productive years for the Croydon Goldfield, despite increasing competition from emerging mining enterprises in South Africa and Western Australia. Most mining companies on the field were local concerns and Croydon brokers established a local stock exchange in 1892. The bank crash of 1893 was a setback for local capital and economic activity on the field waned temporarily.|$|E
25|$|The Great Railroad Strike of 1922, a {{nationwide}} railroad shop workers strike, began on July 1. The immediate {{cause of the}} strike was the Railroad Labor Board's announcement that hourly wages for railway repair and maintenance workers would <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> seven cents on July 1. This cut, which represented an average 12% wage decrease for the affected workers, prompted a shop workers vote {{on whether or not}} to strike. The operators' union did not join in the strike, and the railroads employed strikebreakers to fill three-fourths of the roughly 400,000 vacated positions, increasing hostilities between the railroads and the striking workers.|$|E
