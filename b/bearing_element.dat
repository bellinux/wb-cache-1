50|$|Portland cement {{is by far}} {{the most}} common type of cement in general use around the world. This cement is made by heating {{limestone}} (calcium carbonate) with other materials (such as clay) to 1450 °C in a kiln, in a process known as calcination, whereby a molecule of carbon dioxide is liberated from the calcium carbonate to form calcium oxide, or quicklime, which then chemically combines with the other materials that have been included in the mix to form calcium silicates and other cementitious compounds. The resulting hard substance, called 'clinker', is then ground with a small amount of gypsum into a powder to make 'ordinary Portland cement', the most commonly used type of cement (often referred to as OPC).Portland cement is a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar and most non-specialty grout.
