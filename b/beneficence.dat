5|$|In {{his article}} of 2002, Alan A. Stone, {{who as a}} member of team had {{examined}} Pyotr Grigorenko and found him mentally healthy in 1979, disregarded the findings of the World Psychiatric Association and the later avowal of Soviet psychiatrists themselves and put forward the academically revisionist theory that there was no political abuse of psychiatry as a tool against pacific dissidence in the former USSR. He asserted {{that it was time for}} psychiatry in the Western countries to reconsider the supposedly documented accounts of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR in the hope of discovering that Soviet psychiatrists were more deserving of sympathy than condemnation. In Stone's words, he believes that Snezhnevsky was wrongly condemned by critics. According to Stone, one of the first points the Soviet psychiatrists who have been condemned for unethical political abuse of psychiatry make is that the revolution is the greatest good for the greatest number, the greatest piece of social justice, and the greatest <b>beneficence</b> imaginable in the twentieth century. In the Western view, the ethical compass of the Soviet psychiatrists begins to wander when they act in the service of this greatest <b>beneficence.</b>|$|E

5|$|German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel {{presented}} {{two main}} criticisms of Kantian ethics. He first argued that Kantian ethics provides no specific {{information about what}} people should do because Kant's moral law is solely a principle of non-contradiction. He argued that Kant's ethics lack any content and so cannot constitute a supreme principle of morality. To illustrate this point, Hegel and his followers have presented {{a number of cases}} in which the Formula of Universal Law either provides no meaningful answer or gives an obviously wrong answer. Hegel used Kant's example of being trusted with another man's money to argue that Kant's Formula of Universal Law cannot determine whether a social system of property is a morally good thing, because either answer can entail contradictions. He also used the example of helping the poor: if everyone helped the poor, there would be no poor left to help, so <b>beneficence</b> would be impossible if universalised, making it immoral according to Kant's model. Hegel's second criticism was that Kant's ethics forces humans into an internal conflict between reason and desire. For Hegel, it is unnatural for humans to suppress their desire and subordinate it to reason. This means that, by not addressing the tension between self-interest and morality, Kant's ethics cannot give humans any reason to be moral.|$|E

25|$|Autonomy {{can come}} into {{conflict}} with <b>beneficence</b> when patients disagree with recommendations that healthcare professionals believe are in the patient's best interest.

Study Design: A cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Communities in Shanghai, Chengdu and Hangzhou, China between July to September, 2006. Methodology: Face-to-face questionnaire interviews through household visit were carried out to collect information on tea consumption and health conditions in Chinese men. The amount of tea-leaves consumed per time was weighed in grams using identical balances. Results: In this study, 73. 7 % (2156 / 2927) subjects met the criteria of present tea drinkers (PTDRs) {{at the time of}} interview, and the age-gender standardized proportion was 66. 4 %.

25|$|Although much {{of nursing}} ethics can appear similar to medical ethics, {{there are some}} factors that {{differentiate}} it. Breier-Mackie suggests that nurses' focus on care and nurture, rather than cure of illness, results in a distinctive ethics. Furthermore, nursing ethics emphasizes the ethics of everyday practice rather than moral dilemmas. Nursing ethics {{is more concerned with}} developing the caring relationship than broader principles, such as <b>beneficence</b> and justice. For example, a concern to promote <b>beneficence</b> may be expressed in traditional medical ethics by the exercise of paternalism, where the health professional makes a decision based upon a perspective of acting in the patient's best interests. However, it is argued by some that this approach acts against person-centred values found in nursing ethics.|$|E
25|$|Fabian Tassano has {{questioned}} {{the idea that}} <b>beneficence</b> might in some cases have priority over autonomy. He has argued that violations of autonomy {{are more likely to}} reflect the interests of the state or of the supplier group than the interests of the patient.|$|E

60|$|The over-fastidiousness of some unhealthily {{critical}} minds, {{as well as}} {{the moral}} pusillanimity of others, equally bars the acceptance of effectually substantial favors from persons whose motive in proffering them, is not altogether clear and unimpeachable; and toward whom, perhaps, some prior coolness or indifference has been shown. But when the acceptance of such a favor would be really convenient and desirable to the one party, and completely unattended with any serious distress to the other; there would seem to be no sensible objection to an immediate embrace of the offer. And when the acceptor is in rank and fortune the general equal of the profferer, and perhaps his superior, so that any courtesy he receives, can be amply returned in the natural course of future events, then all motives to decline are very materially lessened. And as for the thousand inconceivable finicalnesses of small pros and cons about imaginary fitnesses, and proprieties, and self-consistencies; thank heaven, in the hour of heart-health, none such shilly-shallying sail-trimmers ever balk the onward course of a bluff-minded man. He takes the world as it is; and carelessly accommodates himself to its whimsical humors; nor ever feels any compunction at receiving the greatest possible favors from those who are as able to grant, as free to bestow. He himself bestows upon occasion; so that, at bottom, common charity steps in to dictate a favorable consideration for all possible profferings; seeing that the acceptance shall only the more enrich him, indirectly, for new and larger <b>beneficences</b> of his own.|$|R
6000|$|If we {{approach}} the morals of either superiors or inferiors, {{we are in a}} region where it behooves us to tread carefully. To be honest, I know nothing about them, and I will not assume to know anything. I heard from authority which I could not suspect of posing for omniscience that the English rustics were apt to be very depraved, but they may on the other hand be saints for all that I can prove against them. They are superstitious, it is said, and there are few villages or old houses that have not their tutelary spectres. The belief in ghosts is almost universal among the people; as I may allow without superiority, for I do not know but I believe in them myself, and there are some million of American spiritualists who make an open profession of faith in them. It is said also that the poor in England are much spoiled by the constant aid given them in charity. This is supposed to corrupt them, and to make them dependent upon the favors of fortune, rather than the sweat of their brows. On the other hand, they often cannot get work, as I infer from the armies of the unemployed, and, in these cases, I cannot hold them greatly to blame if they bless their givers by their readiness to receive. If one may infer from the incessant <b>beneficences,</b> and the constant demands for more and more charities, one heaped upon another, there are more good objects in England than anywhere else under the sun, for one only gives to good objects, of course. The oppression of the subscriptions is tempered by the smallness of the sum which may satisfy them.

No doubt it will be put to his credit in the books of the Recording Angel, but what the Judge of all the Earth will say of it at the Last Day there is no telling. I should not be surprised if He accounted it of less merit than some other things that Clemens did and was: less than his abhorrence of the Spanish War, and the destruction of the South-African republics, and our deceit of the Filipinos, and his hate of slavery, and his payment of his portion of our race's debt to the race of the colored student whom he saw through college, and his support of a poor artist for three years in Paris, and his loan of opportunity to the youth who became the most brilliant of our actor-dramatists, and his eager pardon of the thoughtless girl who was near paying the penalty of her impertinence with the loss of her place, and his remembering that the insolent brakeman got so few dollars a month, and his sympathy for working-men standing up to money in their Unions, and even his pity for the wounded bird throbbing out its little life on the grass for the pleasure of the cruel fool who shot it. These and the thousand other charities and <b>beneficences</b> in which he abounded, openly or secretly, may avail him more than the discharge of his firm's liabilities with the Judge of all the Earth, who surely will do right, but whose measures and criterions no man knows, and I least of all men.|$|R

The costs of treatment, {{including}} chemotherapeutic drugs and radiotherapy, are no exceptions. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the direct medical cost of radiotherapy and the annual increasing trend of expenditures in Taiwan. Methods: This study utilized data retrieving from the original claim data of the reim bursement of the Health Insurance Research Database (HIRD) derived from Taiwan’s Health Insurance (HI) program. Detailed data on the direct medical cost within the radiotherapy process for <b>beneficences</b> were extracted from inpatient expenditures by admissions (DD) and ambulatory care expenditures by visits (CD) database according to the reimbursed expenditure code of radiotherapy from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2005. Prescriptions for radiotherapy were retrieved and the direct medical costs for radiotherapy were collected based on the NHI reimbursement price list of 2005. The annual increasing trend of expenditures was also explored according to the perspective of Bureau Health Insurance of Taiwan. Results: The total direct medical costs of r adiotherapy for cancer patients were increas ing from 2000 to 2005, which were estimated to US $ 7. 80 million, US $ 8. 09 million, US $ 7. 58 million, US $ 10. 7 million, US $ 12. 2 million and US $ 15. 9 million in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. The increased percentage corresponded to the total healthcare expenditures claimed was increased substantially from 0. 82 % in 2000 to 1. 22 % in 2005. The total direct medical costs within the radiotherapy process were also increased gradually if identified by different types of r adiotherapy and teaching hospital levels. The direct medical costs attribute to radiotherapy, com pared to total health care expenditures in Taiwan, were similar to the costs of antica ncer drugs for cancer patients annually. Conclusions: The direct medical costs of radiation therapy increased substanti ally each year. Further cost analysis on radiation therapy is needed in years beyond 2005. </p...|$|R

Njihov znacaj, kao i uloga pojedinih clanova obitelji u gospodarskom, humanitarnom, kulturnom i inovatorskom radu bili su predstavljeni na velikoj izložbi 2004. godine koju je priredio Gradski muzej Križevci. Uz podatke o podrijetlu obitelji Kiepach, u ovom tekstu naglasak ce biti na izumiteljskom radu mladog Marcela Kiepacha, posljednjeg muškog potomka križevackog ogranka obitelji koji je poginuo u 1. svj. ratu u svojoj 21. godini života. Želja nam je, da se i ovim tekstom pridonese, prije svega, boljem upoznavanju ovog ingenioznog mladica i nepravedno zaboravljenog, talentiranog izumitelja. For {{the purpose}} of the {{management}} of their estates, the aristocratic family Kiepach of Haselburg moves to Križevci after the year 1830. They stem from the South of Tirol, and in the 16 th ct. they are awarded the title of «the noblemen of Haselburg» (Haselburg is a fort near Bozen). Ignac Kiepach {{was the first of the}} Kiepachs to move to Croatia around 1800. He becomes the owner of the city of Samobor by marriage. His son is the progenitor of the Križevci branch of the Kiepachs. The aristocratic family Kiepach lived in Križevci for over 100 years and because of their credits on the areas of economy, the advancing of agriculture and other <b>beneficences,</b> they represent one of the most significant families ever to have lived in Križevci. Unfortunately, after World War II the communist government confiscate their property and their castle in Križevci, and the inheritors mostly leave Croatia. Paula Kiepach-Nestoroff, the daughter of the last nobleman, is the only one who has stayed. Thanks to her, the City Museum of Križevci acquired all of the preserved documentation on the Kiepach family, which enabled us to investigate on their origin, genealogy and the significance of the family as a member of the Croatian aristocracy. In the heritage of the Kiepach family there were also the original documents concerning the inventor’s work of the young Marcel Kiepach (1894 - 1915), brother of the mentioned Paula. While still in high school, he became famous for his inventions at the age of 16. The newspapers called him a «monster of the mind» (Wunderkind), and his inventions were a sort of a sensation among experts as well as in the broader public. As early as in 1910, Marcel Kiepach patents his gyrocompass in Berlin. It was a device for the remote transmission of the inclination of the ship compass, upon which undesired magnetic forces or the metal surroundings of the ship had no effect. This invention enabled the ships to navigate more precisely. After that, in 1912 he patents the «dynamo machine for the lighting of all kinds of vehicles» in Paris. In the same year he reports to the office in Berlin an electric switch for X-ray machines, which worked on the basis of gas pressure. The invention of the small transformator for low voltage (which was used for miners’ and dentists’ lamps, massage motors etc.) was also of special importance, and it was patented by him together with the famous designer Heinrich Weiland. Marcel also worked on other inventions on the field of electrotechnics, which is shown by many sketches, calculations and notes, preserved in the City Museum of Križevci. For his inventions, he was called the «Tesla of Križevci». His career however ended by his tragic death in World War I, where he died in 1915 as a volunteer on the front at the age of 21. Except the City Museum of Križevci, numerous documents about Marcel Kiepach (sketches, calculations, correspondence) have also lately been discovered in the Archive of Maribor (Slovenia). His relative Milan Kiepach, a fellow-student of his in Berlin, took all of the documentation of the young inventor after his death and brought it to Maribor where he found employment. For this reason there are proposals to organize an international scientific assembly on Marcel Kiepach, in order to try to discover other documents in the countries with which he was in contact regarding his inventions. This is the only way to establish the real contribution of Marcel Kiepach, the unjustly forgotten inventor on the field of electrotechnics. (Translated by Marina Bertovic...|$|R

25|$|Values such {{as these}} do not give answers {{as to how to}} handle a {{particular}} situation, but provide a useful framework for understanding conflicts. When moral values are in conflict, the result may be an ethical dilemma or crisis. Sometimes, no good solution to a dilemma in medical ethics exists, and occasionally, the values of the medical community (i.e., the hospital and its staff) conflict with the values of the individual patient, family, or larger non-medical community. Conflicts can also arise between health care providers, or among family members.
