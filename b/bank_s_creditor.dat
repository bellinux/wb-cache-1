40|$|Organizational law {{empowers}} {{firms to}} hold assets and enter contracts as entities that are legally distinct from their owners and managers. Legal scholars and economists have commented extensively on {{one form of}} this partitioning between firms and owners: namely, the rule of limited liability that insulates firm owners from business debts. But a less-noticed form of legal partitioning, which we call 2 ̆ 2 entity shielding, 2 ̆ 2 is both economically and historically more significant than limited liability. While limited liability shields owners 2 ̆ 7 personal assets from a firm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>creditors,</b> entity shielding protects firm assets from the owners 2 ̆ 7 personal creditors (and from creditors of other business ventures), thus reserving those assets for the firm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>creditors.</b> Entity shielding creates important economic benefits, including a lower cost of credit for firm owners, reduced bankruptcy administration costs, enhanced stability, {{and the possibility of}} a market in shares. But entity shielding also imposes costs by requiring specialized legal and business institutions and inviting opportunism vis-d-vis both personal and business creditors. The changing balance of these benefits and costs illuminates the evolution of legal entities across time and societies. To both illustrate and test this proposition, we describe the development of entity shielding in four historical epochs: ancient Rome, the Italian Middle Ages, England of the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, and the United States from the nineteenth century to the present...|$|R

40|$|Using U. <b>S.</b> {{cross-border}} <b>bank</b> exposure data, {{this study}} establishes {{a line of}} arguments and findings, which together constitute the following observation: "Deregulation of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks,</b> via consolidation and a volatile earnings stream, increased volatility in bank lending to emerging economies, and, in due course, worsened the financial crises in emerging economies. " The volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending to emerging economies has increased during the past twenty years. To explain the across-the-board, increasing volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> emerging market claims, this study turns to the supply side of the equation: the deregulation in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> sector that imparted this commonality to their banks' investment patterns to emerging economies. In so doing, it unveils the linkages through which U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> deregulation ratcheted up the volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending into emerging economies. It starts with the detection of a particular feature of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> emerging market lending that warrants further attention [...] increasing volatility over time. Unlike bank lending from Europe or Japan, U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending exhibited the unique feature of increasing volatility over time, regardless of its destination. By looking into domestic push factors that could have contributed to this characteristic, this study identified a temporal association between important deregulation initiatives in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> industry and the volatility of emerging market lending by U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> during the same period. This association was then explained by the linkages between the major outcomes of deregulation [...] consolidation of the banking industry and diversification of banking activities [...] and the increased volatility of lending into emerging economies. Together, it argues that the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> deregulation had the unintended and unanticipated side effect of increasing the volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending into emerging economies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{documents}} the changing international exposures of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> balance sheets since the mid- 1980 <b>s.</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> have foreign positions heavily concentrated in Europe, with more volatile flows to {{other regions of}} the world. In recent years some cross-border claims on Latin American countries have declined, while claims extended locally by the branches and subsidiaries of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> have grown. The foreign exposures of larger U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> tend to be less volatile than claims of smaller banks, and locally-issued claims tend to be more stable than cross-border flows. Business cycle variables have mixed influence on U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> cross-border and local claims. The cross-border claims of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> on European customers tend to be procyclical. By contrast, locally generated and cross border claims on Latin American customers of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> are not robustly related to either U. S. or country-specific business cycle variables.

By contrast, relying on short-term wholesale funding has increasingly proven to be a disadvantage in the crisis, as inter-bank and capital markets froze. Besides, the more an affiliate abroad takes recourse to intra-bank funding in the crisis, the more it becomes dependent on a stable deposit and long-term wholesale funding position of its parent bank. We furthermore detect competition for intra-bank funding across the affiliates abroad as well as an increasing focus on the parent <b>bank</b> <b>s</b> home market activities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} an {{open economy}} portfolio balance model with endogenous asset supply. Domestic producers choose an optimal capital structure and finance capital goods through credit, bonds and equity assets. Private households hold {{a portfolio of}} domestic and foreign assets, shift balances depending on risk-return considerations, and maximise real consumption {{in accordance with the}} law of one price. Within this general equilibrium model, it will be shown that central bank interventions may promote an inefficient international allocation of real capital. The application of expansive monetary interventions throughout the course of economic crises maintains the domestic stock of real capital at the cost of inflation, currency devaluation, distortions of interest rates and asset prices, and risk clusters on the central <b>bank</b> <b>s</b> balance sheet. Exchange rate stabilising interventions have the result that the central bank can also stabilise the domestic stock of real capital.

If <b>bank</b> <b>S</b> is the sending bank (or brokerage), and bank R is the receiving bank (or brokerage), and banks I1, I2 and I3 are intermediary banks, the client may only have a contract with <b>bank</b> <b>S</b> and/or R, but banks I1, I2 and I3 can (and often do) take money from the wire without any direct arrangement with the client.
