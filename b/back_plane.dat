50|$|The SCSI ID of {{a device}} in a drive {{enclosure}} {{that has a}} <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> is set either by jumpers or by the slot in the enclosure the device is installed into, depending {{on the model of}} the enclosure. In the latter case, each slot on the enclosure's <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> delivers control signals to the drive to select a unique SCSI ID. A SCSI enclosure without a <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> often has a switch for each drive to choose the drive's SCSI ID. The enclosure is packaged with connectors that must be plugged into the drive where the jumpers are typically located; the switch emulates the necessary jumpers. While there is no standard that makes this work, drive designers typically set up their jumper headers in a consistent format that matches the way that these switches implement.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} how the amplitude and phase of <b>back</b> focal <b>plane</b> distribution can be recovered in a confocal microscope system from several intensity {{images in the}} image plane. These will have {{a wide range of}} uses for imaging and sensing. We believe this method is complementary to the V(z) technique where the sample is defocused. The field generated in the <b>back</b> focal <b>plane</b> may be processed by virtual propagation which averages noise in a highly efficient manner. In this paper, we demonstrate that the phase information on the <b>back</b> focal <b>plane</b> can be recovered using ptychography with no need to modify the optical configuration and employ an interferometer. This phase information plays a crucial role in sensitivity of surface plasmons resonance biosensing systems.

5000|$|He is {{recognized}} for his innovative technique creating miniature still photography [...] from actual landscapes by simulating shallow {{depth of field}} via the use of tilt-shift lens photography. Barbieri's technique simulates the shallow depth of field effect of macro photography by tilting the lens's angle to the <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> of the camera, which creates a gradual blurring {{at the top and}} bottom edges, or left and right edges of the filmed image. The technique is called selected focus and the effect is that a picture of an actual city looks like the picture of a model.|$|E

40|$|Learning {{of spatial}} inter-item {{associations}} can speed up visual search in everyday life, an effect {{referred to as}} contextual cueing (Chun & Jiang, 1998). Whereas previous studies investigated contextual cueing primarily using 2 D layouts, the current study examined how 3 D depth influences contextual learning in visual search. In two experiments, the search items were presented evenly distributed across front and <b>back</b> <b>planes</b> in an initial training session. In the subsequent test session, the search items were either swapped between the front and <b>back</b> <b>planes</b> (Experiment 1) or between {{the left and right}} halves (Experiment 2) of the displays. The results showed that repeated spatial contexts were learned efficiently under 3 D viewing conditions, facilitating search in the training sessions, in both experiments. Importantly, contextual cueing remained robust and virtually unaffected following the swap of depth planes in Experiment 1, but it was substantially reduced (to nonsignificant levels) following the left–right side swap in Experiment 2. This result pattern indicates that spatial, but not depth, inter-item variations limit effective contextual guidance. Restated, contextual cueing (even under 3 D viewing conditions) is primarily based on 2 D inter-item associations, while depth-defined spatial regularities are probably not encoded during contextual learning. Hence, changing the depth relations does not impact the cueing effect...|$|R

30|$|The {{failure of}} ‘stamp-rock foundation’ system is take place by tensile {{fracture}} {{at the front}} stamp plane and shear fracture or crushing (in the strongly heterogeneous rock) at the back one. In first case the angle between displacement vector and fracture plane is 60 °– 90 ° and in second case it is 30 °– 45 °. The foundation is stiffer the rupture under front plane is more clearly expressed. The typical macrofracture mode is represented in Fig.  8 a. The failure starts at the front (loaded) plane: the rupture fracture (9) is extended under the <b>back</b> <b>plane.</b> The final failure takes place along shear fracture (10) at the <b>back</b> <b>plane.</b> The stress state at the ‘stamp-rock foundation’ system is shown in Fig.  8 d. The calculations shown that under the front plane the “pressure–tension” stress zone and under the <b>back</b> <b>plane</b> the “pressure–pressure” stress zone are formed at the first load steps. In accordance with Mohr criterion [24] the plastic zone is formed at the front plane and extended under <b>back</b> <b>plane.</b> At the loading level of 0.85 from strength the plastic zone occupies the all contact zone (Fig.  8 e).
