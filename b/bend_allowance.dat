50|$|<b>Bend</b> <b>allowance</b> {{and bend}} {{deduction}} are quantities {{used to determine}} the flat length of sheet stock to give the desired dimension of the bent part. Both bend deduction and <b>bend</b> <b>allowance</b> represent the difference between the neutral line or unbent flat pattern (the required length of the material prior to bending) and the formed bend. Subtracting them from the combined length of both flanges gives the flat pattern length. The question of which formula to use is determined by the dimensioning method used to define the flanges as shown in the two diagrams below.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bend</b> <b>allowance</b> (BA) is {{the length}} of the arc of the neutral line between the tangent points of a bend in any material. Adding {{the length of}} each flange taken between the center of the radius to the BA gives the Flat Pattern length. This <b>bend</b> <b>allowance</b> formula is used to {{determine}} the flat pattern length when a bend is dimensioned from 1) the center of the radius, 2) a tangent point of the radius or 3) the outside tangent point of the radius on an acute angle bend..|$|E
5000|$|The bend {{deduction}} BD {{is defined}} as the difference between the sum of the flange lengths (from the edge to the apex) and the initial flat length.The outside set back (OSSB) is the length from the tangent point of the radius to the apex of the outside of the bend. The bend deduction (BD) is twice the outside setback minus the <b>bend</b> <b>allowance.</b> BD is calculated using the following formula, where A is the angle in radians (=degrees*Ï€/180): ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The U-bending {{process is}} a common sheet-metal forming process widely {{employed}} to fabricate sheet parts like channels, beams, and frames of various sizes applied in almost all industrial fields. In recent years, the precision requirements are increased on the U-bent parts. To achieve these requirements, in this study, the effects of part geometry on the spring-back/spring-go feature including work piece length, U-channel width, punch and die radii, and work piece thickness, were investigated by using the finite element method (FEM) and laboratory experiments. The FEM simulation results clearly revealed the influence of part geometry on spring-back/spring-go feature via the changes of stress distribution analyses on the <b>bending</b> <b>allowance</b> zone, the bottom of bent part, and the U-leg of bent part. Specifically, the part geometry affected on the bending characteristic on the <b>bending</b> <b>allowance</b> zone, {{as well as it}} affected on the spring-back feature. In addition, the part geometry also affected on the formation of reversed bending characteristic on the bottom and U-leg of bent parts, as well as it affected on the spring-go feature. The bending angle could be achieved by compensating these bending and reversed bending characteristics. Therefore, to meet the required bending angle, the suitable design of part geometry was strongly considered to maintain the balancing of the bending and reversed bending characteristics. The laboratory experiments were carried out to validate the accuracy of the FEM simulation results. The FEM simulation results showed good agreement with the experimental results with reference to the bending angle and bending force...|$|R
40|$|The coined-bead {{technique}} is commonly {{applied in the}} V-bending process to eliminate the spring-back feature and to achieve the required bending angle. In the present research, {{which is based on}} a stress distribution analysis, the effects of a coined-bead geometry in the V-bending process on the increased compressive stress in the <b>bending</b> <b>allowance</b> zone and on the increased reversed bending zone in the leg of the workpiece were observed and characterized. The research also illustrated the variations in spring-back and spring-go characteristics for different coined-bead widths and heights. As the bead width increased, the spring-go decreased, increased, and decreased again for different simulated bead heights and workpiece materials. The research was able to disprove previously suggested theories for coined-beaded V-bending, which suggested that a smaller bead width should be applied to cancel out the spring-back characteristic. In addition, the spring-back characteristic returned when an oversized bead width was applied. Therefore, to achieve the required bending angle, the size of the bead width was optimized both to provide a balance between a favorable stress distribution in the bending zone and reversed bending zone and to reduce the bending load...|$|R
40|$|Sheet-metal {{components}} are used {{extensively in the}} aerospace and the electronic industry, where high precision is an essential requirement for the final products. In precision components, the calculation of the <b>bend</b> <b>allowance</b> is important,in arriving at the final dimensions of the developed length of the sheet metal. <b>Bend</b> <b>allowance</b> {{is defined as the}} length of the unstretched fiber in the bent portion of the sheet. Any inaccuracy in calculating the bend-allowance parameter during bending may result in increasing the inaccuracy in the final developed length of the sheet. This causes the blank size to be incorrect, which in turn causes the location of bend lines, slots, and holes to be inaccurate. This may cause mismatch in the final assembly also. In this paper an attempt has been made to first review the current industrial practice for the calculation of <b>bend</b> <b>allowance.</b> The current empirical methods used to calculate the bend-allowance parameter are examined and the drawbacks associated with them are identified. The highlight of this paper is on a mathematical model which has been developed to calculate the bend-allowance parameter accurately by assuming plane-strain deformation and a rigid-plastic material, considering thinning effects. The effects of temperature and friction are neglected. The bend-allowance parameter is calculated on the basis of material properties such as the yield stress and the strain-hardening exponent, and the tool geometry. The model has been tested with available data in the literature to assess its accuracy...|$|E
40|$|The {{industrial}} {{importance of}} air bending applications with high strength steels {{has increased in}} recent years. However, the limited bendability of high strength steels leads to the necessity of using large radius punches. The usage of such tooling causes a change of the loading scheme from traditional 3 -point bending to 4 -point bending. Therefore, the traditional formulas used for the prediction of bending parameters, such as springback and <b>bend</b> <b>allowance,</b> lack accuracy. In the current contribution, a regression model is proposed {{in order to achieve}} an accurate prediction of bending characteristics. The model is based on phenomenological observations of bending parameters, and fitting of well-established formulas. Large radius bending is used mostly for high-strength steels, thus the investigation is performed for Domex 700 MC and Weldox 1300 with thicknesses of 4 and 6 mm. The following bending parameters have been investigated: contact points position, <b>bend</b> <b>allowance,</b> bending force, and springback. The predicted values are compared {{with a wide range of}} experimental tests and the coefficient of determination (R 2) is calculated in order to assess the prediction accuracy. status: publishe...|$|E
