5000|$|The 265-room hotel {{opened on}} April 30, 1984. Joey Kaempfer, founder {{and owner of}} The Kaempfer Company, wanted no extravagance spared in the hotel's {{construction}} or operation. The interior design scheme focused on the color purple. Included among the rooms were two Presidential suites, five deluxe suites, and 24 executive suites. The Presidential suites each had a working fireplace and dining room. The common guest rooms were lavish, with silk wallpaper, furniture made of Honduran mahogany, and down mattresses and pillows. Each room had two phone lines, and each phone {{had the ability to}} place a person on [...] "hold" [...] (then an innovation). The bathrooms were covered with Portuguese marble, with the bidet and toilet in a separate bathroom-within-a-bathroom. Each bathroom featured a very large vanity, wall-mounted hair dryers, and a double-sized bath tub made of Italian marble which filled in under a single minute, and each tub had a Swiss shower. A separate whirlpool bath was included in each bathroom. Each guest received a free monogrammed bathrobe, and each room was outfitted with a loofah and sponge, container full of cotton balls, and luxury <b>bath</b> <b>gels</b> and shampoo. The hotel originally had two formal dining rooms, The Mayfair and The Promenade. An informal dining space, the Mayfair Grill, was adjacent to the lobby. The hotel also had a swimming pool, fitness center, ballroom, and meeting rooms. The $64 million structure was managed by Regent International Hotels, which took a financial interest in the hotel. The Regent was the most expensive hotel ever built in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area (when judged on a cost-per-room basis).|$|E

5000|$|Mazunte is a {{small village}} wedged between a wide, one km long beach and the Sierra Madre del Sur. Parallel to the beach is the Avenida Paseo del Mazunte, the main street, which connects the village with others nearby. [...] The area has mostly {{deciduous}} trees which drop leaves in the dry season. About twenty different species can be found here {{as well as a}} number of cactus and mangroves. [...] It is still mostly a rural village, with mornings filling with the sound of roosters crowing. The village is somewhat larger than San Agustinillo, but the main distinction is that its architecture is based on the use of natural materials. [...] Mazunte has building codes that stipulate that all constructions must blend with already existent structures. The community has strict rules about how, where and what to build in the community. Part of the reason for this is to discourage land speculation and over development.Guido Rocco is simply called “the Italian” or “the architect” and is well known and respected for building many of the eco-friendly cabins and other buildings here, which he calls “bio-architecture.” These structures consists mostly of palm fronds, adobe, bamboo, shells stones coconut shells and wood, designed to blend in with the landscape. He arrived in Mazunte in the late 1980s and has remained since. He and his family first arrived in the 1970s as visitors when there were no roads and Mazunte was accessible only by boat. Other Italians have immigrated to Mazunte and other towns along this stretch of coast. Their presence is most easily seen in the Italian restaurants that have been established, some of which offer pizza cooked in a wood-fired oven.Cosméticos Naturales de Mazunte is a community enterprise dedicated to making high quality make-up that is 100% environmentally friendly.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a novel {{process has been}} {{developed}} to improve the corrosion properties of ferritic stainless steels. Titanium oxide coatings have been deposited onto stainless steel by sol–gel process after a pre-functionalization of the substrate in a conversion <b>bath.</b> <b>Gel</b> titania was prepared by hydrolysis of a titanium butoxide through a sol–gel process. Duplex systems "conversion layer/uniform TiO 2 coating" have been prepared on stainless steels using a dipping technique and thermal post-treatments at 450 °C. The preparation of sol–gel coatings with specific chemical functions offers tailoring of their structure, texture and thickness and allows the fabrication of large coatings. The morphology {{and structure of the}} coatings were analysed using scanning electron microscopy with field effect gun (SEM-FEG), Mass spectroscopy of secondary ions (SIMS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The anticorrosion performances and the ageing effects of the coatings have been evaluated in neutral and aggressive media by using several normalized tests. The results show that the conversion layer was not sufficient to protect steel but sol–gel TiO 2 coatings, anchored on the metal substrate via the conversion layer, show good adhesion with the substrate and act as a very efficient protective barrier against corrosion. So, duplex layers with TiO 2 nanoparticle coatings on steels exhibit an excellent corrosion resistance due to a ceramic protective barrier on metal surface. Analysis of the data indicates that the films act as geometric blocking layers against exposure to the corrosive media and increase drastically the lifetime of the substrate...|$|R

40|$|A {{description}} is presented {{of the results}} of studies of the water and salt transport properties of PVA membranes, taking into account radiation crosslinked PVA membranes, diffusive salt permeability through PVA membranes, and heat treated PVA membranes.

The preparation of thin skinned, asymmetric PVA membranes is also discussed. The employed method has a certain similarity to the classical phase inversion method, which is widely applied in the casting of asymmetric reverse osmosis membranes. Instead of using a <b>gelling</b> <b>bath</b> composed of a nonsolvent for the membrane material and miscible with the solvent from which the membrane is cast, a 'complexing' bath is used, which is a solution of a complexing agent in water...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{progress}} {{in the study of}} surfactant-responsive polymer gels is reviewed. Polymer gels can be designed that drastically swell or shrink in response to small changes in the concentration of an ionic surfactant in an external <b>bath</b> containing the <b>gel.</b> The gel swelling isotherm, where the equilibrium gel volume is measured {{as a function of the}} external surfactant concentration, yields useful information on polymer-surfactant interactions. Associating and nonassociating polymer-surfactant pairs may be distinguished, and critical concentrations for surfactant binding can be determined. Generic swelling isotherms for different classes of systems have been established, which apply to chemically widely different gels (cellulose derivatives, vinyl polymers). Hydrophobicity and charge are the essential polymer parameters that determine the featur s of these isotherms. In order for a surfactant to associate to a nonionic polymer, the polymer hydrophobicity has to exceed a certain threshold. The required threshold hydrophobicity varies with the alkyl chain length, the headgroup, and the counterion of the surfactant. Added salt has large effects on all swelling isotherms...|$|R
