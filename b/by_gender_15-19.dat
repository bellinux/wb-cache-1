40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to analyze to what extent university students exhibit healthy lifestyles and which sociodemographic variables influence healthy lifestyles. 4809 university students randomly selected were measured by use of the Healthy Lifestyle Scale for University Students questionnaire. When controlling for the other variables, the total healthy lifestyles score was predicted <b>by</b> <b>gender,</b> grade, father’s level of education, and type of institution; exercise behaviour was partially predicted <b>by</b> <b>gender,</b> grade, type of institution, and family monthly income; regular behaviour was modulated <b>by</b> <b>gender,</b> grade, type of institution, family monthly income, and father’s educational level; nutrition behaviour was partially affected by type of institution, family monthly income, and father’s educational level; health risk behaviour was modulated <b>by</b> <b>gender,</b> mother’s level of education, and family monthly income; health responsibility was modulated <b>by</b> <b>gender,</b> grade, type of institution, and father’s educational level; social support was modulated <b>by</b> <b>gender,</b> grade, and father’s educational level; stress management was modulated <b>by</b> <b>gender,</b> grade, type of institution, and mother’s education level; life appreciation was modulated by grade, type of institution, and mother’s educational level. These influences should be taken into account in designing interventions for specific socio-demographic profiles that might be at higher risk for certain behaviours...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{participation}} in group-based credit programs, <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> of participant, on the health status of children <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> in rural Bangladesh is investigated. These credit programs are well suited to studies of how gender-specific resources alter intra-household allocations because they induce differential participation <b>by</b> <b>gender.</b> Women's credit is {{found to have a}} large and statistically significant impact on two of three measures of the healthiness of both boy and girl children. Credit provided to men has no statistically significant impact and the null hypothesis of equal credit effects <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> of participant is rejected.

30|$|In {{our next}} set of analyses, we {{examined}} student responses separately <b>by</b> <b>gender,</b> {{to see if there}} were differential levels of involvement <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> across different robotics competitions and different age groups (see Table  2).

40|$|In this experiment, 18 {{female and}} 18 male Sprague Dawley rats were {{utilized}} to evaluate physiological and biochemical traits. Rats were fed to ad libitum {{consumption of the}} conventional diet and housed in cages separately <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> at density of 160 cm 2 per rat from 3 to 10 weeks of age. At {{the end of the}} experiment, body weights were measured for growth, blood samples were collected for metabolic profile and hemogram and then rats were euthansized for organ development. After log transformation of blood cell data, all response variables were subjected to t-test for gender comparison and normality and correlation tests for generation of reference values and determination of autocorrelations. Growth and organ development were greatly affected <b>by</b> <b>gender.</b> However, gender effect on weights of organs altered when weights were expressed in proportion to body weight. Differences in blood chemistry <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> were in agreements with those in weights of organs. White blood cell counts were not different. Erythrocyte and related hemogram variables differed <b>by</b> <b>gender.</b> In conclusion, variations and differences in biochemical and physiological traits <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> should be taken into consideration for future investigations coping with medical and nutritional issues...|$|R

Online shop election conducted purposively, that was facebook, kaskus, and online shop community. The study included 145 consumers. Data analysis was performed by descriptive, different test, and regression test. The results showed that perceived risks, evaluation of information, and online shopping expenditure among groups that worked and didn’t work differ significantly. Consumers had lifestyle in moderate category, perceived risk in risk category, neutral perceived benefits, and low online searching. Perceived benefits was influenced <b>by</b> <b>gender,</b> age, occupation, income, and lifestyle, while the perceived risks was influenced by work and lifestyle. Online search influenced <b>by</b> <b>gender,</b> while evaluation of information was influenced <b>by</b> <b>gender,</b> perceived benefits, and perceived risks.

40|$|This review (under the International Joint Learning Initiative on Children and AIDS) {{provides}} a detailed evidence analysis of gender, children and AIDS. Six systematic reviews {{provide the most}} up to date evidence base on research surrounding children and HIV on key topics of treatment resistance and adherence, schooling, nutrition, cognitive development and orphaning and bereavement. Traditional systematic review techniques were used to identify all published studies on four key topics, then studies were selected according to adequacy criteria (sufficient size, control group and adequate measures). A gender analysis was performed on included studies, detailing whether gender was measured, results were analysed <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> or any gender-based findings. For family studies, both {{the gender of the}} parents and gender of the child are needed. Secondary analysis <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> was performed on existing systematic reviews for treatment resistance and adherence. Of the 12 studies on treatment resistance, 11 did not look at gender. One found boys at a seven-fold risk compared to girls. For medication adherence, gender was not significant. Of the 15 studies on schooling, 12 analysed findings <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> with an overall female disadvantage. Of the 14 studies on nutrition, nine analysed <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> with mixed findings. Of the 54 studies on cognitive development, 17 provided gender data, but only four analysed <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> with few differences established. Of the 15 studies on bereavement, seven analysed data <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> again with mixed findings. Major policies fail to provide gender data for young children. WHO, UNAIDS and the international data sets are not gathered or coded <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> for young children (generally under 15 years of age) despite wellestablished gender challenges in later life. This review shows that the current evidence base is inadequate. Data on gender variation and outcome are urgently needed to inform policy and research on children and HIV...|$|R
