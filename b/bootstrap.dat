This paper discusses <b>bootstrapping</b> as a creative financing strategy. <b>Bootstrapping</b> has been advocated in, and documented by, the popular business press. Two methods that broadly address <b>bootstrapping</b> are identified and discussed. These two methods include the acquisition and control of resources (both tangible and intangible), and the efficient uses of those resources to finance the enterprise for growth. Examples of <b>bootstrapping</b> activities are presented to illustrate each method. The paper also provides a short-list of practical suggestions for <b>bootstrapping</b> start-up businesses...|$|R
5000|$|The {{semantic}} <b>bootstrapping</b> hypothesis {{has been}} criticized by some linguists. An alternative hypothesis to semantic <b>bootstrapping,</b> syntactic <b>bootstrapping,</b> proposes that verbs are always learned based on their syntactic properties rather than their semantic properties. This is sometimes construed as being incompatible with semantic <b>bootstrapping,</b> which proposes that verb meanings can be identified from the extralinguistic context of use. Pinker does not see syntactic <b>bootstrapping</b> as an alternative or necessarily <b>bootstrapping</b> at all. Pinker makes the critical distinction that semantic <b>bootstrapping</b> seeks to answer how children can learn syntax and grammar while the syntactic <b>bootstrapping</b> hypothesis is only concerned with how children learn verb meanings. Pinker believes that syntactic <b>bootstrapping</b> is more accurately [...] "syntactic cueing of word meaning" [...] and that this use of syntactic knowledge to obtain new semantic knowledge {{is in no way}} contradictory to semantic <b>bootstrapping,</b> but is another technique a child may use in later stages of language acquisition.|$|R

By the early 1990s there was sufficient interest among his seminar graduates to launch a collaborative implementation of his work, and the <b>Bootstrap</b> Alliance was formed as a non-profit home base for this effort. Although the invasion of Iraq and subsequent recession spawned a rash of belt-tightening reorganizations which drastically redirected the efforts of their alliance partners, they continued with the management seminars, consulting, and small-scale collaborations.

40|$|Judgmental <b>bootstrapping</b> {{is a type}} {{of expert}} system. It {{translates}} an expert=s rules into a quantitative model by regressing the expert=s forecasts against the information that he used. <b>Bootstrapping</b> models apply an expert=s rules consistently, and many studies have shown that decisions and predictions from <b>bootstrapping</b> models are similar to those from the experts. Three studies showed that <b>bootstrapping</b> improved the quality of production decisions in companies. To date, research on forecasting with judgmental <b>bootstrapping</b> has been restricted primarily to cross-sectional data, not time-series data. Studies from psychology, education, personnel, marketing, and finance, showed that <b>bootstrapping</b> forecasts were more accurate than forecasts made by experts using unaided judgment. They were more accurate for eight of eleven comparisons, less accurate in one, and there were two ties. The gains in accuracy were generally substantial. <b>Bootstrapping</b> can be useful when historical data on the variable to be forecast are lacking or of poor quality; otherwise, econometric models should be used. <b>Bootstrapping</b> is most appropriate for complex situations, where judgments are unreliable, and where experts = judgments have some validity. When many forecasts are needed, <b>bootstrapping</b> is cost-effective. If experts differ greatly in expertise, <b>bootstrapping</b> can allow one to draw upon the forecasts made by the best experts. <b>Bootstrapping</b> aids learning; it can help to identify biases in the way experts make predictions, and it can reveal how the best experts make predictions. Finally, judgmental <b>bootstrapping</b> offers the possibility of conducting?experiments @ when the historical data for causal variables have not varied over time. Thus, it can serve as a supplement for econometric models...|$|R

40|$|Today, {{many small}} {{businesses}} are experiencing problems with obtaining long-term external financing. Financial <b>bootstrapping</b> refers to methods used by small businesses to obtain resources, without relying on long-term external financing from debtholders and/or new owners. Instead financing of resources occur in alternative ways. This {{has been found to}} have a great importance for the development and survival of small businesses. Financial <b>bootstrapping</b> is commonly used among small businesses and there are a wide variety of methods to use. Since financial <b>bootstrapping</b> plays a crucial role of SMEs, there is an interest to investigate what influences decisions regarding the choice of <b>bootstrapping</b> method, which in turn can help small businesses to make more informed decisions. This study aims to theoretically develop and empirically test a model for the selection of financial <b>bootstrapping</b> by describing the use of financial <b>bootstrapping</b> in small business and test how underlying factors affects the choice of <b>bootstrapping</b> method. The study has a quantitative research method with a hypothetical-deductive approach in which a web-based survey was sent to a total of 1, 554 small businesses in the manufacturing industry. The results showed that when the owner perceives that the company's financial position is good, the use of the financial <b>bootstrapping</b> decreases, with the largest decrease occurring specifically for the internally oriented <b>bootstrapping</b> methods. Selection of financial <b>bootstrapping</b> method is also affected by how much resources the owner perceive that there is in the environment. If the owner perceive that there a wide array of resources in the environment, the use of the internally oriented <b>bootstrapping</b> methods decreases. The strength of the owner's social network affects the choices of financial <b>bootstrapping</b> method. A stronger relationship with contacts in the social network leads to the socially oriented <b>bootstrapping</b> methods being used to a greater extent.

50|$|Steven Pinker {{presents}} {{his theory}} of semantic <b>bootstrapping,</b> which hypothesizes that children use the meaning of words to start to learn the syntax of their language. Gleitman (1990) counters Pinker’s ideas by asserting that context is insufficient to supply word meaning, as a single context can allow for multiple interpretations of an uttered sentence. She explains that simply observing objects and events in the world does not provide sufficient information to infer the meanings of words and sentences. Pinker, however, argues that semantic <b>bootstrapping</b> and syntactic <b>bootstrapping</b> aren't conflicting ideas, and that semantic <b>bootstrapping</b> makes no claims about learning word meanings. He argues that since semantic <b>bootstrapping</b> is a hypothesis about how children acquire syntax, while syntactic <b>bootstrapping</b> is a hypothesis about how children acquire word meanings, the opposition between the two theories does not necessarily exist.|$|R
40|$|To join an {{unstructured}} {{peer-to-peer network}} like Gnutella, peers have {{to execute a}} <b>bootstrapping</b> function in which they discover other on-line peers and connect to them. Until this <b>bootstrapping</b> step is complete, a peer cannot participate in file sharing activities. Once <b>bootstrapping</b> is complete, a peer’s experience is strongly influenced by the choice of neighbor peers resulting from the <b>bootstrapping</b> step. Despite its importance, there has been very little attention devoted to understanding the behavior of this <b>bootstrapping</b> function. In this paper, we study the <b>bootstrapping</b> process of a peer in the Gnutella network. This is a preliminary investigation, consisting of 1) an analysis and performance comparison of <b>bootstrapping</b> algorithms of four Gnutella servent implementations, 2) a measurement-based characterization of the global Gnutella Web Caching System (GWebCaches), a primary component of the current <b>bootstrapping</b> functions, and 3) {{a study of the}} behavior and experience of a single GWebCache that was setup locally and made part of the global caching infrastructure. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the performance of the <b>bootstrapping</b> function {{as an integral part of}} a peer-to-peer system. We find that 1) there is considerable variation among various servent implementations that correlates to their <b>bootstrapping</b> performance, 2) even though the GWebCache system is designed to operate as a truly distributed system in keeping with the peer-topeer system philosophy, it actually operates more like a centralized infrastructure function, and 3) the GWebCache system is subject to misreporting of peer and cache availability due to stale data and absence of validity checks.
