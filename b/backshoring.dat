50|$|Reshoring (also {{known as}} onshoring, inshoring and <b>backshoring)</b> is {{the act of}} reintroducing {{domestic}} manufacturing to a country. It is the reverse process of offshoring, where manufacturing is moved to another country where labor is cheaper.|$|E
40|$|This note {{presents}} {{empirical evidence}} on production <b>backshoring</b> – the move-ment of production activities from locations abroad {{back to the}} home country. Between 2010 and Mid- 2012, only four percent of all firms moved production activities back to their home country. For every <b>backshoring</b> firm, {{there are more than}} three offshoring firms. Thus, from today’s perspective it is unlikely that <b>backshoring</b> will be an important driver of a ‘manufacturing renaissance’ in Europe. The most frequent reason for <b>backshoring</b> is poor quality of the goods pro-duced at foreign locations, followed by the loss of flexibility and too high transport costs. Sectors with a high <b>backshoring</b> propensity are electrical equipment, communications equipment and the automotive industry. These sectors may be the most obvious candidates for policy intervention to increase the frequency of <b>backshoring</b> in European manufacturing...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{evaluate}} the adequacy of the present theoretical knowledge relating to divestments and de-internationalization in the context of explaining the <b>backshoring</b> phenomenon – a relatively new, but gaining in importance specific behaviour of companies in the process of internationalization. Research Design & Methods: The paper discusses various aspects of contemporary processes of internationalization. The employed research design is qualitative – the study has been based on conclusions drawn from critical literature studies. Findings: Although <b>backshoring</b> shares some common characteristics with the concepts of de-internationalization and international divestments, there are several noticeable differences: e. g. both de-internationalization and international divestments are rather related to wholly owned subsidiaries, while <b>backshoring</b> includes both activities outsourced to company’s foreign suppliers and to its subsidiaries. Implications & Recommendations: It is necessary to develop new concepts that in a holistic way will define the decision-making process of enterprises which use de-internationalization and <b>backshoring</b> of business processes as part of their long-term internationalization strategies. The article indicates some dependencies and issues that must be considered in formulating new theoretical proposals. Contribution & Value Added: The originality of this study lies in the in-depth analysis of the similarities and differences between the processes of de-internationalization/international divestments and <b>backshoring...</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>backshore</b> zone is {{transitional}} environment strongly {{affected by}} ocean, air and sand movements. On dissipative beaches, {{the formation of}} ephemeral dunes over the <b>backshore</b> zone plays significant contribution in the beach morphodynamics and sediment budget. The aim of this work is to describe a novel method to identify ephemeral dunes in the <b>backshore</b> region and to discuss their morphodynamic behavior. The beach morphology is identified using Argus video imagery, which reveals the behavior of morphologies at Cassino Beach, Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil. Daily images from 2005 to 2007, topographic profiles, meteorological data, and sedimentological parameters {{were used to determine}} the frequency and pervasiveness of these features on the <b>backshore.</b> Results indicated that coastline orientation relative to the dominant NE and E winds and the dissipative morphological beach state favored aeolian sand transport towards the <b>backshore.</b> Prevailing NE winds increase sand transportation to the <b>backshore,</b> resulting in the formation of barchans, transverse, and barchanoid-linguiod dunes. Precipitation inhibits aeolian transport and ephemeral dune formation and maintains the existing morphologies during strong SE and SW winds, provided the storm surge is not too high...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{empirical}} investigation of recent trends and changes in companies' production relocation and <b>backshoring</b> behaviour against the background of the global economic crisis. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical research is based on a large data set of 1, 484 German manufacturing companies as part of the European Manufacturing Survey (EMS). The paper employs a structured set of probit analyses to identify the differences of production relocation and <b>backshoring</b> determinants before and within the crisis. Findings - Against common belief the paper finds that not only the relocation of production to emerging countries, but also the <b>backshoring</b> of once offshored manufacturing capacities to the home base is a relevant phenomenon. Since the emergence of the global economic crisis, relocation activities declined significantly, whereas the level of <b>backshoring</b> activities has remained stable. Far-shore destinations in Asia gain in attractiveness over near-shore locations in Eastern Europe. Particularly export-intensive companies tended recently towards (re-) concentrating of their production capacities, trying to exploit the benefits of higher capacity utilisation and a superior relation of variable costs to fix costs at their existing locations. Research limitations/implications - Although covering a significant range of industrial sectors in Germany, more empirical evidence is needed from other branches and countries. Looking forward it is proposed to systemically integrate scenarios on the future development of the most influential environmental factors in future research frameworks for global production decisions and value chains. Practical implications - The findings strongly recommend a revision of established decision-making schemes for production relocations based on pure cost efficiency considerations. Decision-making should integrate qualitative environmental factors and dynamic considerations using scenario-based tools. Companies need to understand and prepare for dynamic developments at different locations which can strategically necessitate <b>backshoring</b> after a certain time. Originality/value - The research considerably widens the empirical knowledge on recent trends in relocation activities and their inherent risks, which in a dynamic perspective are sometimes forcing <b>backshoring</b> activities...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 1990 s many German {{companies}} have relocated parts of their production abroad (offshoring). This development has been caused on the one hand by innovations in information and communication technologies that are supported by the liberalization of the international trade, {{and on the other hand}} by the reduction of transportation costs due to technological development. Through relocation, companies can benefit from the country-specific institutions. Further, they can also improve their cost structure and their market position. However the offshoring decision is, in addition to the wage differentials and the country-specific factors, also influenced by the characteristics of the production processes. So far, this fact has been considered only in theoretical approaches. The relocation of parts of the production chain abroad is not an irreversible process. Thus, since the end of the 1990 s, a new trend can be observed, namely the return back to the domestic country (<b>backshoring).</b> Pre-existing studies see <b>backshoring</b> mainly as a “failure” of the foreign investment, supposedly conditioned by an overhasty and biased offshoring decision. However, this negative view of <b>backshoring</b> neglects the fact that business environments are changeable over time, so that under the changed circumstances it can be more beneficial to produce in the domestic country again. Furthermore, pre-existing surveys fail to consider the impact of the characteristics of the production chain on the <b>backshoring</b> activities of companies. An econometric estimation of this correlation also seems to be missing. On the basis of the introduced research gaps, the goal of this doctoral thesis is to empirically estimate the factors of offshoring and <b>backshoring</b> for German industrial firms. The focus of the research is therefore on the characteristics of the production chain and their impact on the offshoring and <b>backshoring</b> activities of German companies. In order to examine the effect of production-specific factors on the choice of production location, a survey of German firms has been conducted, and the collected specific enterprise data is used for the empirical estimations...|$|E

An analysis of the previous termmanufacturingnext term offshoring and <b>backshoring</b> activities of 1663 German previous termmanufacturingnext term companies shows that production offshoring has currently lost momentum. On the other hand, <b>backshoring</b> of once offshored previous termmanufacturingnext term capacities is also a quantifiable phenomenon. Every fourth to sixth offshoring activity is followed by a <b>backshoring</b> activity within the following 4 years, mainly due to lack of flexibility and quality problems at the foreign location.

This study has attempted to investigate the core motives behind the <b>backshoring</b> decision and which factors that account for a successful reallocation. In addition, study the potential of this phenomenon in Norway, both on a micro and macro level. This is done through case studies on Neuman Aluminium Raufoss, Hunton Fiber AS and Kleven Verft AS. The study needs further quantified research, but it suggests that smart use of automation, the shortening of lead times and smart configuration of the supply chain are the main motives for <b>backshoring.</b> Furthermore, the research suggest that manufacturing firms do not backshore due to a failure to realize unexpected or hidden transaction costs, but because manufacturing technology is changing, allowing for new opportunities. It allows firms to quickly respond to dynamic markets, the operational flexibility of the firm, through a vertically integrated supply chain. Furthermore, <b>backshoring</b> manufacturing require competence that may go beyond core competencies, to build and operate an automated manufacturing facility. <b>Backshoring</b> manufacturing companies are acquiring technological innovations to achieve their goal. Some have little experience with building a modern factory of industry 4. 0, and are confronted with technical challenges and logistical iterations. However, the know-how is available to companies through open-R&D. This concept is widely used in Norwegian industrial clusters, establishing research institutions that share knowledge and collaborate with firms throughout the country. The study differentiate itself from other research on <b>backshoring,</b> by focusing on non-strategic resources and automation, specifically the concept of industry 4. 0.

40|$|Motivated by {{the recent}} <b>backshoring</b> trend, this paper studies a {{sourcing}} game where competing firms may choose between efficient sourcing (e. g., sourcing from overseas) and responsive sourcing (e. g., sourcing from home country). Efficient sourcing usually provides a cost advantage, while responsive sourcing allows a firm to obtain more accurate demand information when making procurement decisions. By characterizing the equilibrium outcome, we find some interesting results driven by the strategic interaction between the firms. First, a firm may still use efficient sourcing in equilibrium even when the cost advantage associated with efficient sourcing does not exist. This is because the firm can dampen competition by reducing the correlation between her own demand information and the competitor’s. Second, a cost hike in efficient sourcing (e. g., the rising labor cost in Asia) may benefit all the firms in the industry. The {{reason is that the}} cost hike may alleviate competition by inducing a new equilibrium sourcing structure. This paper also sheds some light on the recent <b>backshoring</b> trend. First, our analysis indicates that more firms will shift from efficient sourcing to responsive sourcing in equilibrium (i. e., backshore) if the market size shrinks, the demand becomes more volatile, or the sourcing costs rise simultaneously. Second, a firm’s <b>backshoring</b> behavior reduces the competition on the cost dimension, but it also has an ambiguous informational impact on the other firms in the market. In particular, some firms may benefit from increased correlation of their demand information under Cournot competition with substitutable products. Overall, the <b>backshoring</b> behavior can be beneficial to all the firms sticking to their original sourcing strategies under certain conditions...|$|E

40|$|Since the 1960 ’s, {{companies}} have searched for competitive advantage from offshoring their manufacturing processes to countries of lower labour cost, or {{countries that are}} located closer to interesting markets. However, since about 2005, the trend has partly reversed: large amounts of offshoring projects face unprecedented costs and setbacks, making domestic production more favourable again. The reasons for both offshoring and <b>backshoring</b> of production have been studied in detail, but little focus {{has been given to}} how those decisions unfold day by day in the board rooms. In this study, three case companies, one offshoring case and two <b>backshoring</b> cases, were interviewed to find out how manufacturing relocation decisions are really made. The investigation was divided into four major sub-questions: how could the case decisions processes be modelled; {{what is the role of}} management accounting information in those decisions; what factors affect the risk perceptions of decision makers, and; how could the decision making processes be improved. It was found that offshoring and <b>backshoring</b> decisions are very different by nature due to the differences in uncertainty that the decision makers have to deal with. The myriad of options and factors present in choosing an offshore location from anywhere in the world translates into huge information and accounting needs, as well as complex decision making processes including several nested subdecisions. Meanwhile <b>backshoring</b> decisions were found to be very straightforward, less reliant on large amounts of accounting information and less time consuming to implement. This is due to the fact that these decisions usually consider only two locations, the offshored and the domestic location, both of which are well known and measured. The case companies were also asked to determine what parts of the decisions they would want to improve the most. The high level conclusion is that companies that seek global success should remain extra vigilant of the immense complexity of these decisions, and that there is a clear need to quantify and concretify the benefits of domestic production, such as quality, flexibility and trust between suppliers and partners...|$|E
40|$|Defined {{as local}} {{manufacturing}} systems, industrial districts have been recog- nized as {{particularly important for}} the location of firms’ manufacturing activities intertwined with innovation processes. The debate on the interna- tionalization of production has stressed the low value related to manufactur- ing within value chain activities (smile framework), emphasizing the {{need to focus on}} high value-added activities (R&D or marketing). Following multi- national enterprises’ internationalization strategies, also district firms have progressively offshored their production phases in the past years. However, recent studies focused on <b>backshoring</b> have revamped the attention on the domestic control of production for firms’ competitiveness. This chapter explores district firms’ location choices for manufacturing activities between local and global. Based on an empirical analysis of about 260 Italian district firms specialized in mechanics, furniture, and fashion and supported by a case study investigation, our results show that despite district internationali- zation processes, a non-negligible amount of firms still carry out in-house or through outsourcing production activities at district level. Larger firms couple district production and long-term upstream outsourced internationali- zation activities. The district system confirms its role of pooling specialized competences and product know-how, being decisive for firms’ innovation and responsiveness to national and international markets. <b>Backshoring,</b> instead, is a very limited phenomenon and linked to upgrading strategies...|$|E

40|$|A {{straightforward}} conceptual {{method is}} proposed to quantitatively assess the seasonal-scale tendency of retreatment or advancement on microtidal beaches {{by using the}} backshore/foreshore length ratio. This method is based on measuring the cross-shore profile of a beach when it passes through the “transitional state” that separates the high-from the low-energy season, period during which the morphological characteristics of the beach tend to its equilibrium profile. In order to obtain real measurements of <b>backshore</b> (B) and foreshore (F), {{the definition of the}} limits bounding these two important components in subaerial beaches is reviewed and discussed. The approach based on the measurement of the B/F length ratio assumes that foreshore and <b>backshore</b> have equivalent lengths in beaches that approximate to their state of morphodynamic equilibrium (B/F ~ 1). A <b>backshore</b> length exceeding the foreshore length is indicative of a state of beach recession, with a B/F length ratio > 1. When the foreshore length is greater than the <b>backshore</b> length, the shoreline is advancing or, alternatively, it is developing in a state of morphological confinement, i. e. due to the presence of a sea cliff, with a B/F < 1. This practical method is then tested against 36 sand and gravel microtidal beach profiles measured along the coasts of Basilicata, in southern Italy. The various “beach states” are summarised into seven classes (I-VII), each identified from specific value intervals of the B/F length ratio...|$|R

40|$|Information {{technology}} (IT) offshoring is {{an increasingly}} important strategic tool for firms. Although offshoring activities have led to significant cost savings in many cases, a critical concern is that as IT work moves offshore the deep, experiential knowledge will also move offshore. This knowledge loss may leave the domestic firm with a smaller pool of candidates vying for upper-level management jobs, leading to a future disruption in the management supply chain. In this dissertation three models are developed to investigate how the offshoring of IT activities may affect the domestic firm's knowledge level {{and as a result}} the costs of IT work. In the first model the impact of critical model parameters on the offshoring costs is investigated under the assumption that the offshoring rate is fixed. Although short-lived offshoring projects may generate substantial cost savings, long-lived offshoring projects may cause a disruption in the management supply chain, resulting in substantial cost increases. Under some conditions the domestic firm may be locked into an agreement where the <b>backshoring</b> decision becomes economically infeasible. In the second model, the domestic firm is allowed to make the offshoring rate decision. In this case the domestic firm may "steal" learning-by-doing knowledge from the foreign firm with a very low offshoring rate when the knowledge transfer rate is assumed to be constant. This "discontinuity" in knowledge transfer results in a "bang-bang" solution for the offshoring rate. Depending on the level of the disruption in the management supply chain the domestic firm should choose either very small offshoring or full offshoring. In response, it may be in the foreign firm's interest to contract a minimum offshoring rate. The impacts of assuming the knowledge transfer rate as a proportionally increasing function of the offshoring rate is also examined. In this case the middle range offshoring rates are viable solutions for the domestic firm. In the last model, the impact of allowing the domestic firm the real option to alter the offshoring rate is examined. This flexibility provides value in the mid ranges of the disruption of the management supply chain...|$|E
