25|$|The {{temperature}} {{in which the}} crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation {{would depend on the}} milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules, as well as the form of the cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>fat.</b> Chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperature.|$|E
25|$|As a solid {{piece of}} chocolate, the cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>fat</b> {{particles}} {{are in a}} crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter are able to break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases – the melting process. When the heat is removed, the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.|$|E

2500|$|In Canada {{the dairy}} {{industry}} a system {{was put in}} by the Canadian Dairy Commission {{that is responsible for}} maintaining a stable market and line of employment for farmers by using a Supply Management System. This system was put into play in the early 1970s for a consistent pricing of milk for farmers, ensuring no fluctuation in the market [...] The prices are based on the demand for milk throughout the country and how much is being produced. The Canadian Milk Supply Management Committee is in charge of monitoring the production rates of milk. In order to start a new farm or increase production more share into the SMS needs to be bought into known as “Quota”. Quota is a fixed amount that an individual or group are bound to produce or receive. in this case farmers must remain up to or below the amount of “quota” they have bought share of. [...] Each province in Canada has their own cap on quota based on the demand in the market [...] There is a cap on the countries quota known as total quota per month.

40|$|Amount {{and type}} of fats in the diet have an {{important}} effect on bone health and lipid profile. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effect of different types of dietary oils and fats on lipid profile, calcium absorption and bone mineralization in male mice. Mice weighing 25 ± 5 g were divided into nine groups and fed on diets without oils or fats (control group) and containing soybean oil, corn oil, olive oil, palm oil, sunflower oil, <b>butter,</b> animal <b>fat</b> or margarine. Mice fed on diet containing soybean oil or olive oil had the lowest levels of TG, TC, LDL-c and HDL-c as compared to the other groups. Diets with palm oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, <b>butter,</b> animal <b>fat</b> or margarine caused significant decreases in the serum level of calcium as compared to the effect of diet without oils or fats. Mice fed diet containing olive oil, <b>butter</b> or animal <b>fat</b> had significant increase in bone density, while those fed diet containing soybean oil, corn oil, sunflower oil or margarine had significant decreases in femur bone density, compared to the control group. The apparent calcium absorption was significantly increased by feeding diets containing soybean oil, corn oil, palm oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, <b>butter</b> or animal <b>fat.</b> Dietary intake of vegetable oils improved lipid profile while <b>butter,</b> animal <b>fat</b> and margarine had the opposite effect. <b>Butter</b> and animal <b>fats</b> increased calcium and phosphorus deposition in femur bone more than vegetable oils...|$|R
50|$|Hydrolytic rancidity {{refers to}} the odor that {{develops}} when triglycerides are hydrolyzed and free fatty acids are released. This reaction of lipid with water sometimes requires a catalyst, but results {{in the formation of}} free fatty acids and salts of free fatty acids. In particular, short-chain fatty acids, such as common <b>butter</b> <b>fats,</b> are odorous. Rancidity in foods may be very slight, indicated by a loss of freshness to very severe, indicated by objectionable odors and/or flavors.|$|R
2500|$|Several [...] "spreadable" [...] butters {{have been}} developed. These remain softer at colder {{temperatures}} {{and are therefore}} easier to use directly out of refrigeration.

2500|$|Microwave ovens {{are popular}} for {{reheating}} previously cooked foods and cooking {{a variety of}} foods. They are also useful for rapid heating of otherwise slowly prepared cooking items, such as hot <b>butter,</b> <b>fats,</b> and chocolate. Unlike conventional ovens, microwave ovens usually do not directly brown or caramelize food, since they rarely attain the necessary temperatures to produce Maillard reactions. Exceptions occur in rare cases where the oven is used to heat frying-oil and other very oily items (such as bacon), which attain far higher temperatures than that of boiling water.|$|R
50|$|The {{solid red}} color of these breeds has helped in making them popular for {{crossbreeding}} in tropical countrieswith red Zebu dairy breeds like Sahiwal, Red Sindhi and Butana.

5000|$|Looking at {{beriberi}} and {{the problem}} of polished rice, Christiaan Eijkman and Gerrit Grijns were trying to find the cause of polyneuritis (influenced by Louis Pasteur. Eijkman thought bacteria caused beriberi), but McCollum's approach differed in that he was seeking the reason for failure in growth. McCollum and Davis's experiments with rat diets led to the discovery that Eijkman's and Grijns' anti-neuritic substance was the same as their water-soluble B (B vitamins) in 1915. The finding is number8 in their list of conclusions, [...] "The water-soluble accessory is not the same one as is furnished by <b>butter</b> <b>fat.</b> 20 percent addition of <b>butter</b> <b>fat</b> does not induce any growth unless the other accessory is supplied." [...] He later found that B is actually combined from many different compounds. In 1916 McCollum and Cornelia Kennedy named the factors with alphabetical letters.|$|E
50|$|Clarified {{butter is}} milk fat {{rendered}} from butter {{to separate the}} milk solids and water from the butterfat. Typically, it is produced by melting butter and allowing the components to separate by density. The water evaporates, some solids float {{to the surface and}} are skimmed off, and the remainder of the milk solids sink to the bottom and are left behind when the <b>butter</b> <b>fat</b> (which would then be on top) is poured off.|$|E

40|$|Oxidation of fat {{is one of}} {{the basic}} {{reactions}} which causes the depletion of <b>butter</b> and animal <b>fat</b> quality as well as other products containing them. Since the most of reaction products of fat oxidation are harmful for consumers' health, inadequate and scarce monitoring of edible fats and fat containing products quality, presents increased health risk as well as financial loss for the producers. In fat oxidation stability estimation, standard chemical methods were used (iodine number, acid number, peroxide number, anisidine number etc.), which require time and chemical usage. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis presents the simple and efficient way for <b>butter</b> and animal <b>fats</b> oxidation stability estimation. Laboratory investigations were performed to monitor oxidation stability of <b>butter</b> and animal <b>fat</b> in fresh state, as well as in spent phase, used in frying process.

2500|$|In general use, {{the term}} [...] "butter" [...] {{refers to the}} spread dairy product when {{unqualified}} by other descriptors.

5000|$|Reindeer cheese, {{of which}} we present two {{illustrations}} taken from a paper by Barthel and Bergman may be called the richest of all whole milk cheeses, as nearly half its weight consists of <b>butter</b> <b>fats.</b> It is, in fact, a rich cream cheese. It is yellow {{on the outside and}} white on the interior, except in the neighborhood of the numerous cracks, where it is also yellow. When cut into, the white rapidly changes to a golden yellow. The taste is very mild, very creamy, and the cheese melts very easily in the mouth, with the fine aroma of the reindeer milk; it easily becomes rancid and then acquires a strong odor and a burning taste.The Lapps sic frequently take their cheese with coffee in place of cream.|$|R
