25|$|Airtrans {{was built}} to serve 53 passenger, {{employee}} and service stations around the airport, 33 of those for passengers and employees. Each terminal contained 3 passenger stations corresponding to that terminal's section (for example, Terminal 2E Section 1) located adjacent to the lower level terminal drive. These passenger stations contained an enclosed waiting area, destination signage, two sets of <b>bi-parting</b> automatic doors (with room for a third) and elevators to upper level ticketing/baggage claim. In early years of operation entry to the station was gained by placing a quarter in and passing through entry turnstiles. An employee station for each terminal section was located on a separate guideway adjacent to the terminal's ramp area, and screened from passenger view. These stations were more primitive, containing an outdoor waiting area with a fence and no automatic doors preventing access to the electrified guideway.|$|E
2500|$|Montreal's Metro {{trains are}} made of {{low-alloy}} high-tensile steel, painted blue with a thick white stripe running lengthwise. Trains are assembled in three-, six- or nine-car lengths. Each three-car segment element consists of two motor cab cars encompassing a trailer car (M-T-M). Each car is [...] wide and has three (MPM-10) or four (MR-63, MR-73) wide <b>bi-parting</b> leaf doors on each side for rapid passenger entry and egress. Design specifications called for station dwell times of typically 8 to 15 seconds. In response to overcrowding on the Orange Line, a redesign of the MR-73 cars removed some seats to provide more standing room. The newest Bombardier MPM-10 trains allow people to move between cars once on board, so that the passenger load is more evenly distributed.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, a new {{optional}} door {{form was}} introduced, colloquially known as Dutch doors. This form was two <b>bi-parting</b> doors with a flip-up window above. Previously, Astro and Safari vans were equipped only with <b>bi-parting</b> doors. An optional 4.3 L (RPO L35) engine with central port injection and a balance shaft was phased in.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} word {{recognition in}} two patterns of Chinese characters, cross referenced with word frequency. The patterns {{were defined as}} uni-part (semantic radical/component only) and <b>bi-part</b> (including the phonetic radical/component and the semantic radical/component) characters. The interactions of semantic and phonological access in both patterns were inspected. It was observed that in the naming task and the pronunciation-matching task, the subject performance involving the uni-part characters showed longer RT than the <b>bi-part</b> characters. However, with the lexical decision and meaning-matching tasks the uni-part characters showed shorter RT than the <b>bi-part</b> characters. It was also observed that the frequency, which {{is regarded as a}} lexical variable, displayed a strong influence. This suggests that Chinese characters require lexical access in all tasks. This study also suggested that the phonological process is primary in visual word recognition; as there is a significant phonological effect in processing the Chinese <b>bi-part</b> characters, resulting in either the facilitation or inhibition of phonology due to the differing demands of the two task...|$|R

Here down we shall deal with special kind of graded DAGs named KoDAGs. For their definition and first primary properties see [1], where natural join of di-bigraphs (directed <b>bi-parted</b> graphs) and their corresponding adjacency matrices is defined and then applied to investigate cobweb posets and their Hasse digraphs called KoDAGs. In this report we extend the notion of cobweb poset while delivering some elementary consequences of the description and observations established in [1]...|$|R

5000|$|The Clubman {{features}} {{access to}} its cargo space via <b>bi-parting</b> rear doors, known as barn doors or splitdoors. Also, all Clubman models feature a single backwards opening side door to access the rear seats. It is marketed singlarly as the Clubdoor, and is always located on its {{right side of the}} body [...] - [...] irrespective of market. It is much smaller in comparison to the regular driver and passenger side doors. This in turn creates differences between right and left-hand driver markets. In right-hand markets, the steering wheel won't allow the driver's seat from folding as far forward as the passenger seat. This means that left-hand drive markets feature increased access to the rear seat. For right-hand drive markets, including the car's home market, the <b>bi-parting</b> door is located on the road side of the car, requiring rear passengers to exit into the road.|$|E
50|$|Cartwright {{was born}} in Chester and played as a goalkeeper with York City, Stockport County before making his {{professional}} debut for Wrexham in 1996. He was a <b>bi-part</b> player at Wrexham until the 1998-99 season where he played in 43 matches and produced a fine performance in a 0-0 draw at Manchester City. However, he was overlooked in favour of Kevin Dearden and joined Brighton & Hove Albion in 2000. He played in 15 matches for the Seagulls in 2000-01 helping the side win the Third Division title. He joined Shrewsbury Town in July 2001 where he spent two seasons before retiring due to injury.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes an {{extension}} of Batches Petri Nets by a new definition of the batch place called <b>Bi-parts</b> Batch place (BB-place). The flow-density equations that govern the dynamics of control-lable batches inside a BB-place is now defined by a triangular relation. To take into account controlled events, the behaviors of batches are dis-cussed according to a variation of speeds and of maximum flows. The switching dynamics of controllable batches is defined on three behaviors: free, congestion and decongestion behaviors. We also propose the compu-tation of the instantaneous firing flow vector associated with continuous and batch transitions thanks to a resolution of a linear programming problem. An example of traffic road illustrates the novel extensions pro-posed in this paper...|$|R
60|$|At {{such times}} I {{could not help}} {{remarking}} and admiring (although from his rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar analytic ability in Dupin. He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in its exercise--if not exactly in its display--and {{did not hesitate to}} confess the pleasure thus derived. He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms, and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own. His manner at these moments was frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation. Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the <b>Bi-Part</b> Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a double Dupin--the creative and the resolvent.|$|R
50|$|A {{traveler}} curtain, {{also called}} draw curtain, <b>bi-parting</b> curtain, or just traveler, {{is the most}} common type of front curtain used in theaters. Traveler curtains remain at a fixed elevation and open and close horizontally, breaking in the middle, and consequently require a minimum of fly space. The curtains are typically made of velvet and decorated with a series of vertical box pleats along the top edge.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bi-parting</b> doors {{typically}} {{feature a}} longer {{front door and}} a short rear door, without a pillar in between. The configuration offers both a more 'sporty' aesthetic than compared to a traditional sedan, and the utility of 4-doors, though the doors operate inter-subdependently. This means that the forward door must always be opened before the rear-door (which opens in a rear-hinged fashion) can be opened.|$|E

Along with its rebadged variant, the GMC Safari, the Astro was marketed in passenger {{as well as}} cargo and livery configurations—featuring a V6 engine, unibody construction with a separate front engine/suspension sub-frame, leaf-spring rear suspension, rear <b>bi-parting</b> doors, and a seating capacity of up to eight passengers.|$|E
40|$|Natural join of di-bigraphs (directed <b>bi-parted</b> graphs) {{and their}} {{corresponding}} adjacency matrices is defined and then applied {{to investigate the}} so called cobweb posets and their Hasse digraphs called KoDAGs. KoDAGs are special orderable Directed Acyclic Graphs which are cover relation digraphs of cobweb posets introduced by the author few years ago. KoDAGs appear to be distinguished family of Ferrers digraphs which are natural join of a corresponding ordering chain of one direction directed cliques called di-bicliques. These digraphs serve to represent faithfully corresponding relations of arbitrary arity so that all relations of arbitrary arity are their subrelations. Being this chain − way complete (compare with Kompletne, Kuratowski Kn,m bipartite graphs) their DAG denotation is accompanied with the letter K in front of descriptive abbreviation oDAG. The way to join bipartite digraphs of binary into multi-ary relations is the natural join operation either on relations or their digraph representatives. This natural join operation is denoted here by ⊕ → symbol deliberately referring- in a reminiscent manner- to the direct sum ⊕ of adjacency matrices as it becomes the case for disjoint di-bigraphs...|$|R
40|$|In the {{marriage}} problem, {{a variant of}} the <b>bi-parted</b> matching problem, each member has a `wish-list' expressing his/her preference for all possible partners; this list consists of random, positive real numbers drawn from a certain distribution. One searches the lowest cost for the society, at the risk of breaking up pairs in the course of time. Minimization of a global cost function (Hamiltonian) is performed with statistical mechanics techniques at a finite fictitious temperature. The problem is generalized to include bachelors, needed in particular when the groups have different size, and polygamy. Exact solutions are found for the optimal solution (T= 0). The entropy is found to vanish quadratically in $T$. Also other evidence is found that the replica symmetric solution is exact, implying at most a polynomial degeneracy of the optimal solution. Whether bachelors occur or not, depends not only on their intrinsic qualities, or lack thereof, but also on global aspects of the chance for pair formation in society.

The design employed conventional rear swing-open kammback rather than sliding doors and a <b>bi-parting</b> rear tailgate, the lower section formed with seat indentations and cupholders. Other features included a rear center console that doubled as a removable cooler, rear stereo controls in the cargo area, a sliding cargo floor with grocery compartments and an available camping package with an attachable tent and inflatable mattress.|$|E

50|$|Line 1 was allotted 64 coaches. Fourteen trains (of four cars) are {{in service}} during rush hour, and {{seven or eight}} in non-peak hours. All coaches are {{air-conditioned}} and have humidity control, and designed to reduce noise and vibration. Each coach is approximately 2.9 m wide and has 48 seats. A coach has a capacity of 375 passengers, and a single four car train has a total capacity of 1500 passengers. The coach body is made of lightweight stainless steel, with fire resistant metal doors. Coaches have metallic silver colour exteriors, and can be covered with vinyl sheets to display advertisements. The interior features anti-skid floors, and longitudinal seats with dedicated space to accommodate wheelchairs. Trains on Line 1 are fitted with the VTS Firetide 7010 video transmission system. Coaches are also fitted with LED displays showing dynamic route map, and LCD TVs for entertainment, information and advertising. Windows in coaches are made of double glazed laminated glass to shut out noise. Each coach has 8 externally hung, sliding <b>bi-parting</b> doors except the pilot cabin which has only 2. Doors are broad to enable wheelchair access. The maximum gap between the station platform and the doors is 85 mm. Trains are outfitted {{with a number of}} features for safety and convenience, including 3D route maps, first-aid kits, fire-fighting equipment and intercom systems permitting communication with the train driver.

Also based on the Mini Ram and C/V were aftermarket conversion vans sold through official Chrysler dealers and from the conversion companies themselves.The vans were updated for 1987, receiving new headlamps, a new grille and new taillamps, with some minor interior revisions and a new optional V6 engine. Seating arrangements were now limited to seating for five standard and for seven optional on the base and SE, and seating for seven with high-back front buckets standard on the LE, Grand SE, and Grand LE. Deluxe cloth upholstery was now standard on base and all SE models, with the luxury vinyl optional on SEs. On LEs, luxury cloth came standard and for the first time, leather seats were available on the LE models. Additionally, the vans were now available in a long wheelbase variant, marketed as the Grand Voyager and Grand Caravan, which allowed more cargo space behind the rear seat. The Grand Caravan was available in all trim levels, while the Grand Voyager was only available in SE and LE trims. later in 1987, for the 1988 model year, the Chrysler began exporting the minivans to Europe, where it was sold as the Chrysler Voyager. Despite the name, the European Voyager was a rebranded Dodge Caravan, with all the Caravan's trim and styling features, that was adopted to meet European safety and emissions standards. The European Voyager had all the same options and equipment as the Caravan, though the V6 engine was not available as it didn't meet European emission standards. In 1989, the Caravan and Voyager received new front and rear bumpers, as well as new top-of-the-line trims of ES and LX, respectively. Additionally, a luxury Chrysler Town & Country model was launched. Originally intended to be a 1989 model, the Chrysler Town & Country minivan was ultimately introduced as a 1990 model in the spring of 1989. The S-platform Town & Country was the first 1990 model year Chrysler minivan as the Dodge and Plymouth counterparts produced alongside the Town & Country continued under the previous model year until June 1989. Sharing the body of the long-wheelbase (LWB) Grand Voyager/Grand Caravan's Chrysler S platform, the Town & Country was externally distinguished by its chrome waterfall grille, crystal pentastar hood ornament, standard woodgrain applique, grooved lower body cladding (a stretched version of that found on the Caravan ES), and 15" [...] lace-spoke aluminum wheels. Additionally, Town & Country was only available in two exterior colors. Initially, it was available exclusively in Bright White Clearcoat; Black Clearcoat was added in June 1989, coinciding with the release of the 1990 Caravans and Voyagers. As the Chrysler Corporation's most luxurious minivan, the Town & Country came standard with nearly every feature available on Plymouth and Dodge minivans in addition to some exclusive amenities of its own. This included unique gathered leather seating surfaces and door trim panels, front and rear air conditioning, power windows, power locks, an Infinity sound system, seven-passenger seating, luggage rack, and an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Early vehicles were equipped with 3.0 L Mitsubishi 6G72 V6 engines, while those produced from June 1989 onward received an upgrade to Chrysler's in-house 3.3 L EGA V6. As all vehicles equipped with the 3.0 L engine were produced alongside 1989 Dodge and Plymouth models, the United States Environmental Protection Agency classifies such vans as 1989 models rather than 1990s, despite the VINs indicating otherwise. Total S-platform Town & Country production was 1,789 units in 1989 and 3,615 in 1990, making this model of the Town & Country as the most obscure of all the Chrysler minivans.|$|E
