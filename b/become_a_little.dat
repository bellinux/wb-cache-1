Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

500|$|During the Steve Lillywhite sessions, Lee {{described}} the album as a [...] "rainbow of sounds" [...] with heavy, stripped-out songs. According to Lee, it had electro influences {{and a lot}} of drum programming. During the later sessions with Nick Raskulincecz, she discussed two of the album's themes: brokenness ("Brokenness has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of theme, without necessarily offering a solution") and oceans. In a later MTV interview, Lee mentioned other themes: [...] "the quest for freedom, and then there's songs that are just about falling in love". She said that Evanescence used new and vintage instruments (such as a harp, synthesizers and the Moog Taurus Pedal) and recorded the ballads [...] "Secret Door" [...] and [...] "My Heart Is Broken". In a Kerrang! interview, Lee said she was inspired by her life and personal relationships.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Say It Right" [...] was {{directed}} by British duo Rankin & Chris and filmed in Los Angeles, California in late October 2006. It was shot back-to-back with the video for [...] "All Good Things (Come to an End)", the album's third single in Europe. Furtado called the video her [...] "first action thing" [...] since the video for her 2000 single, [...] "I'm like a Bird", and said that it featured her experiencing what she called [...] "a total rock-star moment. It's so iconic." [...] The mini-feathered cocktail dress Furtado wears {{at the opening of}} the video was designed specifically for her by Australian designer Alex Perry, who said, [...] "It's so cool because she's just undergone a bit of a revamp from what her previous image was; she's <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more sexy and glamorous." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1998 Billboards Christie Eliezer interviewed Gudinski, he {{recalled}} that signing Ayers Rock had [...] "allowed the band to tour the US and record their second album there." [...] He explained that they [...] "were a fantastic jazz-fusion band, a real muso's band, but ultimately they didn't have that something unique to cross over." [...] In his 1999 encyclopaedia Dreams, Fantasies, and Nightmares From Far Away Lands, American author Vernon Joynson called Big Red Rock [...] "an excellent example of jazz rock fusion Australian style. The musicianship is of high quality although it tends to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over-indulgent in places". According to Joynson the album had [...] "radio friendly" [...] material and three tracks [...] "filled with fine virtuoso guitar and saxophone", but despite being [...] "quite a popular live act, [...] recordings were hampered by a dilemma over whether to opt for a more serious pursuit of expanding the horizons or for a commercial sound".|$|E

500|$|Orci and Kurtzman read {{graduate}} school dissertations on the series for inspiration; they noted comparisons of Kirk, Spock and McCoy to Shakespearian archetypes, and Kirk and Spock's friendship echoing that of John Lennon and Paul McCartney. They also noted that, {{in the creation}} of this film, they were influenced by Star Wars, particularly in pacing. [...] "I want to feel the space, I want to feel speed and I want to feel all the things that can <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit lost when Star Trek becomes very stately" [...] said Orci. Star Wars permeated in the way they wrote the action sequences, while Burk noted Kirk and Spock's initially cold relationship mirrors how [...] "Han Solo wasn't friends with anyone when they started on their journey." [...] Spock and Uhura were put in an actual relationship as a nod to early episodes highlighting her interest in him. Orci wanted to introduce strong Starfleet captains, concurring with an interviewer that most captains in other films were [...] "patsies" [...] included to make Kirk look greater by comparison.|$|E
500|$|Jayma Mays commented {{of their}} relationship: [...] "Oh no! I don’t know if I can say! That’s a hard {{question}} {{because when you}} see the scenes of Emma and Will, you obviously think 'Oh of course they’re supposed to be together, of course, of course!' but the fact is, is that he’s a married man and Emma knows that’s wrong, and she doesn’t want to be a homewrecker. She doesn’t want to ruin a relationship. So I guess in a perfect world, she could find someone like Will, or maybe Ken Tanaka (laughs) can <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more like Will. But maybe it’s all about respect. Maybe if she can respect Ken enough, that will develop into true love." [...] She also commented of her co-star Matthew Morrison (Will): [...] "We were friends. We knew each other before we started this job. We worked together once before. So, that’s always helpful when you know the person that you’re working with, and you already feel comfortable around them. But yeah, he’s a really good friend, so that makes that stuff a little bit easier." ...|$|E
500|$|The film premiered in late 1972 at {{the third}} Annual Baltimore Film Festival, held {{on the campus of}} the University of Baltimore, where it sold out tickets for three {{successive}} screenings; the film aroused particular interest among underground cinema fans following the success of Multiple Maniacs, which had begun to be screened in New York City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Being picked up by the small independent company New Line Cinema, Pink Flamingos was distributed to Ben Barenholtz, the owner of the Elgin Theater in New York City. At the Elgin Theater, Barenholtz had been promoting the midnight movie scene, primarily by screening Alejandro Jodorowsky's acid western film El Topo (1970). Barenholtz felt that being of an avant-garde nature, Pink Flamingos would fit in well with this crowd, screening it at midnight on Friday and Saturday nights. The film soon gained a cult following at the Elgin Theatre. Barenholtz characterized its early fans as primarily being [...] "downtown gay people, more of the hipper set," [...] but after a while he noted that this group broadened, with the film becoming popular with [...] "working-class kids from New Jersey who would <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> rowdy". Many of these cult cinema fans learned all of the film's lines, reciting them at the screenings, a phenomenon which became associated with another popular midnight movie of the era, The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975).|$|E

500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought I had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would do. If {{you want to play}} comedy then {{you have to be very}} intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E

2500|$|The only {{negative}} {{review of}} the musical appeared in the New York Post: The critic wrote that [...] "it all seemed just a trifle too cute", stating that the score consisted of [...] "a flock of Mr. Rodgers's songs that are pleasant enough, but still manage to sound quite a bit alike ... without much variety in the presentation." [...] She concluded that the show was [...] "very picturesque in a studied fashion, reminding us that life on a farm is apt to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tiresome." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the novella, the {{character}} David Drayton—who is married—has a sexual encounter with Amanda Dumfries, {{who is also}} married. Darabont {{did not want to}} attempt conveying on screen the protagonist being involved in an extramarital affair. The characters in the film, portrayed by Thomas Jane and Laurie Holden respectively, instead share a more emotional relationship. Jane explained, [...] "We kind of form a little family, sort of surrogate family where my son and I'm a father and she becomes the mother to the son. We <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> unit as we're trying to get through this nightmare together." [...] Holden compared the nightmare to what refugees experienced at the Louisiana Superdome during Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
2500|$|The season {{received}} mostly favorable reviews. IGN's Jeremy Conrad, {{gave the}} second season a score of 8.7/10, stating it was [...] "a clear improvement over season ... This season has better pacing, more interesting story arcs, better special effects, and more importantly, better episodes." [...] When referring to Christopher Reeve's guest appearance on the show, the review {{went as far as}} calling it [...] "the best [...] the show has delivered in its current lifespan... Reeve is the best special guest star yet." [...] Another review called the show [...] "excellent" [...] and called the acting of Tom Welling, Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk [...] "phenomenal". Jennifer Contino from Sequential Tart, a comic-book website, observed that the season was more about [...] "the characters and their relationships", rather than the show's reputable [...] "villain-of-the-week" [...] style. She complimented the red kryptonite that the season introduced into the series, stating, [...] "It's fun to see heroes turn bad or see the good guy <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tarnished or confused." [...] In 2009, TV Guide ranked [...] "Rosetta" [...] 81st on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes.|$|E

2500|$|The Japanese {{aesthetic}} developed {{further with}} {{the celebration of}} imperfection and insufficiency, characteristics resulting from the natural ageing process or darkening effect. Shinto, the indigenous religious tradition of Japan, provides {{a basis for the}} appreciation of these qualities, holding to a philosophy of appreciation of life and the world. Sei Shōnagon was a trend-setting court lady of the tenth century who wrote in ‘The Pillow Book’ of her dislike for [...] "a new cloth screen with a colourful and cluttered painting of many cherry blossoms", preferring instead to notice [...] "that one’s elegant Chinese mirror has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cloudy". Her taste was not out of place in the ancient Japanese court. In the twelfth century a Buddhist monk, Yoshida Kenkō, exerted his influence on Japanese aesthetic sensibility resulting from his philosophy of life. He asked, [...] "Are we to look at cherry blossoms only in full bloom, the moon only when it is cloudless? ...Branches about to blossom or garden strewn with faded flowers are worthier of our admiration." [...] The incomplete is also praised by Kenkō, [...] "uniformity and completeness are undesirable". Underpinning or complementing these aesthetic ideals, is the valuing of contrast; when imperfection or the impoverished is contrasted with perfection or opulence, each is emphasised and thus better appreciated.|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the shapes}} of Arretine plain wares were quite closely copied in the later 1st century BC and early 1st century AD {{in a class of}} pottery made in {{north-east}} Gaul and known as Gallo-Belgic ware. Many of these plates and dishes in red-slipped (...) and black-slipped (...) fabrics bear potters' stamps. Other fine, thin-walled flagons, drinking beakers, bowls and dishes were made locally in most regions of the Roman Empire, including frontier provinces such as Britain: for example, Romano-British 'colour-coated' (slipped) wares made at Colchester and in the Nene Valley belong to that classification. Several of the pots {{to the right of the}} group photograph in the lead section of this article are Nene Valley wares, including the large black beaker decorated with a lively hunting scene of hounds and hares in the barbotine technique. Many decorative techniques were used to beautify pottery tableware, including the use of coloured slips, painting, and various textured surfaces. Painted decoration did not, however, continue the Greek and Etruscan traditions as a specialised technique used for elaborate luxury tablewares, though simpler painted designs do appear on many pottery types, both coarse and fine, throughout the Empire. The dividing lines between 'fine' and 'coarse' wares, or tablewares and cooking wares, <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> blurred in the case of some of the local, provincial products, because pottery is often multi-purpose.|$|E
2500|$|By the Triassic, the Permian Zechstein Sea {{had retreated}} and the climate had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> wetter giving a gentle {{transition}} making the Permian-Triassic boundary uncertain in northern England {{as there are}} no fossil horizons or facies changes that make a definitive separation possible as there in continental Europe. The horizon however is characterised by a succession of red marls (calcareous mudstones) deposited on coastal flats, followed by the Sherwood Sandstone (formerly Bunter Sandstone). [...] The 'British Isles' were not islands, but had an intra-continental position within Pangea. The area that now constitutes Great Britain was drifting northwards as Pangea rotated, was at a latitude of 10° - 20° north, equivalent to the latitude of the present day Sahara desert. Erosion of the then recently uplifted landmass formed Aeolian deposits in the southern and central parts of the country. This iron-rich silica sandstone was both oxidised and reworked to give it its red colouration and its name, [...] "New Red Sandstone". British deposits of the era consist of these red beds, alluvial, fluvial and lake deposits, with some shallow-water marine and evaporite deposits. These Permo-Triassic outcrops {{can be seen on}} either side of the Pennines and in Devon. Within the main central England basin (Staffordshire and Cheshire), the deposits are dominated by pebbly sandstones and conglomerates (Chester Pebble Beds, Wilmslow and Wildmoor Sandstones), which have been interpreted as the deposits of a fluvial system running within well-confined channels. The Sherwood Sandstone Group comprises a series of conglomerates, coarse sandstones and mudstones. The Chester pebble beds to the south of Alderley represent material deposited in alluvial fan/braided river system. The finer sediments of the Wilmslow and Helsby Sandstone to the west of Alderley represent alluvial deposits of low sinuosity channels. The Alderley area represents the midpoint between the full braided river system and the lower energy area. Minor aeolian dunes and channel infill deposits in the Wilmslow Sandstones indicate an inter channel area or seasonal drying of some of the minor river channels.|$|E
