40|$|Abstract: Aiming at rapid {{response}} to requirements of mechanical transmission products customization, {{a system for}} rapid <b>locking</b> <b>assembly</b> variant design was proposed in terms of features of <b>locking</b> <b>assembly.</b> The bases of the system are Product Configuration Model (PCM) and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). According to the system, PCM of <b>locking</b> <b>assembly</b> was built by extending traditional Generic Bill of Materials (GBOM). In addition, integration of PCM and CBR was completed by combining method of transforming PCM to a case with similarity assessment algorithm. Moreover, a rapid variant design software system based on PCM and CBR for <b>locking</b> <b>assembly</b> was developed. Finally, the software system was applied to design new <b>locking</b> <b>assembly.</b> Results demonstrate that it is effective for PCM-CBR to support {{rapid response}} to customization...|$|R

50|$|The Maschinengewehr 08 (or MG 08)â€”so-named after 1908, its year of adoptionâ€”was a {{development}} of the license made Maschinengewehr 01. The firing rate depends on the <b>lock</b> <b>assembly</b> used and averages 500 rounds per minute for the Schloss 08 and 600 rounds per minute for the Schloss 16. The gun used 250-round fabric belts of 7.92Ã—57mm ammunition. Sustained firing would lead to overheating. It was water-cooled, using a jacket around the barrel that held approximately one gallon of water. Using a separate attachment sight with range calculator for indirect fire, the MG 08 could be operated from cover. Additional telescopic sights were also developed and used in quantity during the war.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Key tooth {{recognition}} {{is an important}} procedure of <b>lock</b> core <b>assembly,</b> it directly affects the assembly efficiency and qualified product rate. The current method is artificial and mechanical recognition, which has defects of mechanical loss, low precision and automatic degree. This paper proposes an innovative solution based on machine vision technology. The recognition system uses TMS 320 DM 642 as the core processor. The image sensor MT 9 M 001 acquires key image. The operation of image processing algorithm produces the key tooth code. Communication with the <b>lock</b> core <b>assembly</b> system uses 485 -bus.

50|$|The MAG uses ignited powder gases vented {{through a}} port in the barrel to propel a gas piston rod {{connected}} to the <b>locking</b> <b>assembly</b> (it uses a long-stroke piston system).

The locking shoulder and camming surfaces that guide the locking lever are located {{at the base of the}} receiver. The MAG uses a series of proven design concepts from other successful firearms, for example the locking mechanism is modeled on that of the Browning M1918 (BAR) automatic rifle, and the feed and trigger mechanisms are from the WWII-era MG42 universal machine gun.|$|R

40|$|Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a {{translational}} recoding mechanism {{commonly used}} by RNA viruses to express {{two or more}} proteins from a single mRNA at a fixed ratio. An essential element in this process {{is the presence of}} an RNA secondary structure, such as a pseudoknot or a hairpin, located downstream of the slippery sequence. Here, we have tested the efficiency of RNA oligonucleotides annealing downstream of the slippery sequence to induce frameshifting in vitro. Maximal frameshifting was observed with oligonucleotides of 12 â€“ 18 [*]nt. Antisense oligonucleotides <b>bearing</b> <b>locked</b> nucleid acid (LNA) modifications also proved to be efficient frameshift-stimulators in contrast to DNA oligonucleotides. The number, sequence and location of LNA bases in an otherwise DNA oligonucleotide have to be carefully manipulated to obtain optimal levels of frameshifting. Our data favor a model in which RNA stability at the entrance of the ribosomal tunnel is the major determinant of stimulating slippage rather than a specific three-dimensional structure of the stimulating RNA element...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Direct {{contact and}} {{airborne}} transmission are established modes of microbial contamination of standard in-travenous (iv) assemblies such as piggyback and heparin lock. 1 - 17 In this study, 60 % {{of the standard}} iv assemblies inoc-ulated with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) at the barrel of their exposed needle grew these organisms when cultured in a Soy Casein Digest Broth (SCDB). Also, 40 closed, positive <b>locking</b> iv <b>assemblies</b> (Click-Lock) were inoculated at possible contamination sites, and none of these assemblies grew S. aureus in a SCDB.
