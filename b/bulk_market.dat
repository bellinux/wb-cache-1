The last hurdles were cleared under a meeting at the A. G. Weser shipyard in Bremen on 6 April 1964, and a contract for building the first combined vessel was signed. The vessel was christened 16 June 1965 as Naess Norseman. The German industrialist owning the shipyard proposed the type to be called Naess-type; Næss himself however found it more appropriate to name it after the cargoes carried. Thus the name for the new type was to be OBO for Oil-Bulk-Ore. The vessel performed as expected, with some 75% of the time with cargo and only 25% in ballast. The much increased time with cargo would then more than outweigh the 15% higher cost of the vessel. Adding to the versatility of the type was that the oil and <b>bulk</b> <b>market</b> often developed differently. The OBO ship could then trade with bulk cargoes when that market was on top, and change to oil when the demand for tanker tonnage was high.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{outlines the}} problems that are faced by the shipowners in the dry bulk sector of the shipping industry. It indicates that charter planning plays {{a fundamental role in}} maintaining the financial viability of shipping companies. Retrospective data from specific dry <b>bulk</b> shipping <b>markets</b> was analysed in order to identify the most beneficial mix of time and voyage charters, if any. This analysis formed the basis for the development of forecasting models which were designed to improve the strategic decision taking policies in shipping companies trading in the dry <b>bulk</b> <b>markets.</b> The dry <b>bulk</b> shipping <b>markets</b> were investigated to identify the major factors that have created financial difficulties within shipping companies. This showed that the inter-relationship between the shipowner's chartering policy, purchasing policy and world economic climate was the major influence. The analysis of specific charter markets, grain and coal (United States to Europe or Japan) showed that in terms of revenue generation a combination of time and voyage charters was, in general, superior to remaining in one charter mode. A series of forecast models were used to forecast twelve months of voyage charter rates, these were then compared with known twelve month time charter rates to derive a charter type decision. They were also compared with the known voyage charter rates. The analysis of the forecasted voyage charter rates indicated that there was a severe limitation in the current forecasting techniques used. It was shown that in the short term a forecast could be identified, but in the long term the forecasted rates, and to a certain extent, the long term trends were not sufficiently reliable to be used as decision tools. Suggestions are included for further development of other forecast techniques and data manipulation to improve the decision making methods of the shipping company.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between the time-varying volatility of dry bulk freight rates and the change of the supply of fleet trading in dry <b>bulk</b> <b>markets.</b> An abundance of research has been done to understand the time-varying characteristics of freight rate volatility, yet few have discussed the determinants of freight volatility. We therefore examine freight volatility against the changes in fleet size and other shipping market variables over January 1973 –October 2010. The study employs a two-step model specification. The first step is the measurement of freight rate volatility through an AR-GARCH model; the second step is the analysis of {{the relationship between}} freight rate volatility and fleet size growth through a GMM regression. We confirm similar findings in the literature that freight rate volatility is time varying. Furthermore, the results reveal that the change in fleet size positively affects freight rate volatility, while the spot rate volatility of Capesize dry bulk exhibits a stronger reaction to the change in fleet size. The results of this study contribute in a general sense to understanding the systematic risk of shipping markets. ► We examine the determinants of freight volatility in dry <b>bulk</b> shipping <b>markets.</b> ► We adopt a two-step model specification: a GARCH model and a GMM regression. ► Fleet size growth has a positive impact on freight volatility. ► Freight rate volatility is time varying...|$|R
40|$|Investing in {{the bulk}} carrier market {{constitutes}} a rather risky investment {{due to the}} volatility of the bulk carrier freight rates. In this study it is attempted to uncover the benefits of using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in forecasting the Capesize Ore Voyage Rates from Tubarao to Rotterdam with a 145, 000 dwt Bulk carrier. Initially, market analysis allows {{the assessment of the}} relation of some parameters of the dry <b>bulk</b> <b>market</b> with the evolution of freight rates. Subsequently, ANNs with an appropriate architecture are constructed and sufficient data, in terms of quantity and quality, are collected and organized so as to establish both the training and the testing data sets. The use of ANNs along with genetic algorithms allows the prediction of bulk freight rates with considerable accuracy for as long as eighteen months ahead and this is quantified by calculating the relative and absolute errors. It is concluded that ANNs offer a promising approach to forecasting the <b>bulk</b> <b>market</b> when coupled with efficient market modeling. by Athanasios V. Voudris. Thesis (S.

Therefore, to eliminate the impact of random incidents in dry <b>bulk</b> <b>market,</b> wavelet transform is adopted to denoise the BDI data series.

40|$|Abstract: The paper uses a real options {{valuation}} {{model with}} stochastic freight rates to investigate market efficiency and {{the economics of}} switching between the dry bulk and the tanker markets in international shipping. A dry bulk carrier is replaced with a tanker when the expected net present value of such a switch is optimal from a real options based decision rule. Depending {{on the development of}} the markets a reversal may take place later. The cost and demand parameters upon which the decisions to switch are made, including the stochastic characteristics of freight rates, are estimated from an empirical analysis that is updated every week throughout a 12 -year time period from 1993 to 2005. The second-hand market for bulk ships seems to have been efficient most of these years in the sense that market switching usually did not pay off, with one major exception: it seemed profitable in expectation to leave the dry <b>bulk</b> <b>market</b> and enter the tanker market over a significant period of time shortly after the millennium shift, and to return to dry <b>bulk</b> <b>market</b> about three years later. These points in time corresponded with an unprecedented boom period in the tanker and drybulk freight markets, respectively, and the result suggest that agents in the second-hand market were slow to adjust their expectations. In retrospect, such an investment policy also happened to be profitable compared to staying put in the tanker market, even after accounting for transaction costs...|$|E

Therefore, {{for the analysis of}} synchronicity and idiosyncrasy of dry bulk markets, this paper constructs a dynamic factor model of the change rate of BDI’s constituting indices and then it performs maximum likelihood estimation. One important finding is that, for such larger ships as Capesize and Panamax, there has been a significant increase in their synchronicity with global common factor after the 2008 global financial crisis, but for the other smaller ships, the opposite phenomenon has been observed. This paper suggests two important future research topics. One is extending the suggested dynamic factor model with the structural change (regime switching).

However, the majority of the rural population is still price conscious; they prefer to buy un-processed grains at the cheapest price. Hence, value chain analysis should also look into cost cutting innovations along the value chain to benefit price conscious poor consumers besides focusing on value added products.
