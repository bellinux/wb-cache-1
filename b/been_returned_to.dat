5|$|An oratory, {{originally}} {{fitted to}} the roof of the Well Tower but removed before 1891, was decorated with twenty stained glass windows. Ten of these windows are displayed at Cardiff Castle, while the other ten are displayed on site; two missing windows having <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the castle in 2011. Other rooms in the castle include Lady Margaret Bute's Bedroom, the servants' hall and the kitchen.|$|E

Following the cancellation of Batwoman, {{the character}} has <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Detective Comics in a leading role for the DC Rebirth event and received another solo series in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Substantial remains {{still exist}} and {{are open to}} the public, managed by English Heritage. The {{adjacent}} Victorian castle of Goodrich Court was demolished in 1949, restoring the original landscape. The Roaring Meg mortar, preserved by Herefordshire Council, has <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the site, along with a number of civil war cannonballs found at Goodrich during excavations in the 1920s.|$|E

50|$|In April 2002, Senna's FW16 {{chassis number}} 02 <b>was</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the Williams team. The team {{reported}} that the car was in an advanced state of deterioration and was subsequently destroyed. Senna's helmet <b>was</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Bell, and <b>was</b> incinerated.

5|$|Areas of {{the coast}} near Exmouth, The Fleet at Weymouth and the beaches at Studland have also been used for {{training}} for war, but have since <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> civilian use. Parts {{of the coast}}, especially around Portland, can be dangerous, and shipwrecks have been {{a feature of the}} coast. In January 2007 the coast experienced its most environmentally damaging wreck when the MSC Napoli, a 2,400 capacity container ship, was beached at Branscombe near Sidmouth, losing oil and cargo.|$|E
5|$|During Edward's reign, Æthelwig {{worked to}} recover {{some of the}} abbey's estates that had been granted {{to others in the}} past but had not <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the abbey's custody. He managed to restore the abbey's {{possession}} of a number of these lost estates. A large section of the description of the abbot's life in the Chronicon is concerned with a listing of estates that Æthelwig acquired or recovered. The estates listed were in the counties of Worcestershire, Warwickshire, and Gloucestershire.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} the battalion moved to the island of Fauro to guard Japanese prisoners of war. As the demobilisation process began, members of the battalion were slowly repatriated to Australia, while others were transferred to other units for further service elsewhere. By March 1946 {{the last of the}} battalion's personnel had <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Australia and on 10 May 1946, the 7th Battalion was formally disbanded. During its service throughout the war the battalion lost 25 men killed or died on active service, with a further 50 men wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one DSO, one MC, one MM and 16 MIDs.|$|E

5|$|Former {{prisoners of}} war were given a high {{priority}} for repatriation back to Australia and discharge. Planning for the recovery of prisoners of the Japanese, most of whom had been held in harsh conditions, had begun in 1944 and the 2nd and 3rd Australian Prisoner of War Reception Groups were established at Singapore and Manila respectively in August 1945. By the end of September most of the prisoners recovered from Singapore, Java and Sumatra had <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Australia along with about half of those recovered from the Bangkok area. Transport shortages delayed the repatriation of Australian prisoners from Formosa, Japan and Korea, but almost all were on their way home by mid-September.|$|E
5|$|The Klondike's {{choice of}} {{programming}} earned it a negative reputation, and Towne Cinema {{was unable to}} run the Klondike profitably. The company sought buyers for the theatre as early as 1976, asking $600,000. But, despite all of the theatre's problems under Towne Cinema, {{it is unlikely that}} it would have <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> its original use without the money they poured into its renovation. Their efforts to restore the building are a significant reason why the Princess is a cinema today.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the game is to collect the eight pieces of the Android Queen's body then stitch her back {{together}} again. The player must first find and approach the refrigerator in order to be told where the first body part can be found. Once this has <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the player's trapped father, the next body part location will be revealed. Once all eight body parts have been collected and returned to the refrigerator, the player must find a needle and thread in order to restore the Android Queen. The location of the refrigerator is randomized {{at the beginning of each}} new game.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, the {{locomotive}} was cleaned, repainted, and {{donated to the}} Lake Superior Railroad Museum.

5|$|The ponies {{collect the}} Elements and re-approach Discord, who casually passes off their threat. However, with all six ponies restored, the Elements activate, firing a rainbow-beam {{of light that}} engulfs Discord and Ponyville. In moments, Ponyville has <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> normal and Discord is once again turned to stone. The ponies' victory is celebrated by a large {{ceremony}} at Canterlot, led by Celestia, who praises their heroism {{and the power of}} their friendship and reveals a new stained-glass window of the six ponies defeating Discord.|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} of research, the Hrant Dink Foundation {{published}} a book, some 400 pages long, describing the current situation of seized assets and properties of the Armenian community. With the help of government deed and title records, {{the members of the}} Hrant Dink foundation have uncovered the title records of all the properties owned by various foundations and have produced the book replete with photographs, charts, maps, and other illustrations which describe the seized properties and assets and its current status. The Hrant Dink foundation states that 661 properties in Istanbul alone were confiscated by the Turkish government, leaving only 580 of the 1,328 properties owned by the 53 Armenian foundations (schools, churches, hospitals, etc.). The current circumstances of the remaining 87 could not be determined. Out of the 661 confiscated properties, 143 (21.6%) have <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the Armenian foundation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1944, {{the ship}} was due for another overhaul; work was to have lasted for three months. The Soviet Army had {{advanced}} so far, however, {{that it was necessary}} to move the ship farther away from the front, {{despite the fact that she}} had only one working turbine. On 29 January 1945, the ship left Gotenhafen, arriving in Kiel on 2 February. She entered the Germaniawerft shipyard for refitting. On 3 May, RAF bombers attacked the harbor and severely damaged the ship. Her crew scuttled the wrecked ship at her moorings at 04:25 on 3 May. In July 1945, after the end of the war, Admiral Hipper was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay and subsequently broken up for scrap in 1948–1952. Her bell was on display at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. The bell has since <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Germany and is on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial.|$|E

5|$|Chief Vanuatu, {{leader of}} the bigfoots, in {{recognition}} of the pair's actions, makes the Freelance Police members of the bigfoot tribe and tells them of a spell that will make the world safe for bigfoots again, preventing their capture by humans. However, the chief requires help deciphering the spell's four ingredients, and asks for Sam and Max's help. Eventually, they discover that the ingredients are a vegetable resembling John Muir, hair restoration tonic, the tooth of a dinosaur, and a vortex contained within a snow globe. Combined with a live bigfoot sacrifice—which Max substitutes for frozen bigfoot-clad Bumpus and Harvey—the ingredients cause large trees to spring into existence, destroying towns and cities and covering the bulk of the west United States in forest. Content that their work is done, Sam and Max take the frozen ice block containing Bumpus and Harvey to the carnival. Believing that Bruno has <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> them, the owners give a large reward of skee ball tickets to the Freelance Police, who then spend the end credits shooting targets at a carnival stall with real firearms.|$|E
5|$|Despite the dissatisfaction {{of the men}} in the SWPA, the {{demobilisation}} and repatriation process generally proceeded smoothly. Most men had <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Australia by January 1946 and 80 {{percent were}} demobilised by the middle of the year. Before leaving the military service men and women attended either a dispersal centre or naval depot where they were provided with a medical examination, interviewed by a rehabilitation officer and provided with information about the benefits they were eligible for. The Manpower Directorate was then responsible for placing discharged personnel in employment as well as providing them with identity documentation and ration entitlements. Training courses were made available to veterans, and by 1951 94,000 had completed university, technical or rural training courses and 39,000 were still in training. A further 135,000 began training but withdrew before completing their course.|$|E
5|$|Dresden saw {{action in}} the Battle of Coronel in November, where she engaged the British cruiser , and at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December, where {{she was the only}} German warship to escape destruction. She eluded her British pursuers for several more months, until she put into Robinson Crusoe Island in March 1915. Her engines were worn out and she had almost no coal left for her boilers, so the ship's captain {{contacted}} the local Chilean authorities to have Dresden interned. She was trapped by British cruisers, including her old opponent Glasgow. The British violated Chilean neutrality and opened fire on the ship in the Battle of Más a Tierra. The Germans scuttled Dresden and the majority of the crew escaped to be interned in Chile {{for the duration of the}} war. The wreck remains in the harbor; several artifacts, including her bell and compass, have <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Germany.|$|E
5000|$|In 1852, {{some of the}} {{residents}} of the northern portion of Harrison Township requested <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Bergen County.

5|$|Following {{the defeat}} in America, the 64th {{remained}} in Jamaica for two years, returning to England in 1783. Four {{years later the}} regiment was stationed in Ireland, before sailing once more for the West Indies in 1793 at {{the outbreak of the}} Napoleonic Wars. At the end of the Seven Years' War both Martinique and Guadeloupe had <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> France {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Paris. From Barbados the 64th Foot took part in the invasion of Martinique in early 1794. As before the flank companies were detached from the rest of the regiment but all three elements were involved in the actions in Martinique. This short but successful campaign earned the regiment its second battle honour, Martinique 1794—although as with the earlier Guadeloupe honour, it was not actually awarded until 1909.|$|E
5|$|From 1948, H.R. Holmes {{had been}} the curator but in the late 1950s had wished to {{relinquish}} the post. A replacement curator was not easily found and {{the care of the}} Collections was managed on a part-time basis. A security crisis in 1959 developed after it was discovered that the contents of one of the frames in the Tapling Collection was missing. In 1961 James A. Mackay was recruited as a research assistant {{to take care of the}} Collections. In 1971 the police arrested Mackay (promoted to Assistant Keeper in 1965) and charged him with stealing items from the British Museum Philatelic Collections on loan from the Crown Agents. The stolen progressive proofs (test prints of stamp designs) should have <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the Crown Agents for destruction and were valued at £7,600. Mackay had exchanged the proofs for Winston Churchill stamps worth £400. He was fined £1,000 and dismissed from the Museum. As a result of the thefts, security was improved by recruiting Bob Schoolley-West, one of the investigating police officers. The Crown Agents withdrew their agreement for lending new stamps for display in the King's Library.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914, at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Hitler was living in Munich and voluntarily enlisted in the Bavarian Army. According to a 1924 report by the Bavarian authorities, allowing Hitler to serve was almost certainly an administrative error, since as an Austrian citizen, he should have <b>been</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Austria. Posted to the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment), {{he served as a}} dispatch runner on the Western Front in France and Belgium, spending nearly half his time at the regimental headquarters in Fournes-en-Weppes, well behind the front lines. He was present at the First Battle of Ypres, the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Arras, and the Battle of Passchendaele, and was wounded at the Somme. He was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross, Second Class, in 1914. On a recommendation by Lieutenant Hugo Gutmann, Hitler's Jewish superior, he received the Iron Cross, First Class on 4 August 1918, a decoration rarely awarded to one of Hitler's Gefreiter rank. He received the Black Wound Badge on 18 May 1918.|$|E
