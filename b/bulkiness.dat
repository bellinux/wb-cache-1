5|$|The 10-month 767 {{flight test}} program {{utilized}} {{the first six}} aircraft built. The first four aircraft were equipped with JT9D engines, while the fifth and sixth were fitted with CF6 engines. The test fleet was largely used to evaluate avionics, flight systems, handling, and performance, while the sixth aircraft was used for route-proving flights. During testing, pilots described the 767 as generally easy to fly, with its maneuverability unencumbered by the <b>bulkiness</b> associated with larger wide-body jets. Following 1,600 hours of flight tests, the JT9D-powered 767-200 received certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in July 1982. The first delivery occurred on August 19, 1982, to United Airlines. The CF6-powered 767-200 received certification in September 1982, followed by the first delivery to Delta Air Lines on October 25, 1982.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{complaints}} is the <b>bulkiness</b> of the tablets. The main offender is PZA (the tablets being the size of horse tablets). PZA syrup may be offered as a substitute, or if {{the size of the}} tablets is truly an issue and liquid preparations are not available, then PZA can be omitted altogether. If PZA is omitted, the patient should be warned that this results in {{a significant increase in the}} duration of treatment (details of regimens omitting PZA are given below).|$|E
25|$|A {{wound in}} the lateral nasal wall that is greater than 15nbsp&mm in {{diameter}} can also be corrected with a superiorly based, nasolabial-flap, which is especially suited for correcting distal defects that lay among the convexities of the nasal tip and the alar lobule. The nasolabial flap can correct defects that comprehend the distal two-thirds of the nose, {{if there is a}} supply of skin sufficient for constructing the base of the flap pedicle; and the donor sites cannot be closed primarily. Yet, <b>bulkiness</b> is the principal disadvantage of the nasolabial flap—except in elderly patients with atrophic cheek skin; nonetheless, it is technically effective for patients unsuitable for a two-stage rhinoplasty with a paramedian forehead flap.|$|E
500|$|Adult walrus {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by their prominent tusks, whiskers, [...] and <b>bulkiness.</b> Adult {{males in the}} Pacific can weigh more than [...] and, among pinnipeds, are exceeded in size only by the two species of elephant seals. Walruses live mostly in shallow waters above the continental shelves, spending significant amounts of {{their lives on the}} sea ice looking for benthic bivalve mollusks to eat. Walruses are relatively long-lived, social animals, and they are considered to be a [...] "keystone species" [...] in the Arctic marine regions.|$|E
500|$|The game {{contains}} weapons {{based on}} non-fictional firearms, such as pistols, assault rifles, and submachine guns, {{as well as}} entirely fictional armaments like particle beam weapons. Each firearm differs in terms of ammunition type, accuracy, range, fire rate, damage, and <b>bulkiness.</b> The latter characteristic is crucial, as more powerful/specialized weapons {{tend to be more}} cumbersome and slow the player's maneuvers. Unlike other games of the genre where lighter/smaller weapons tend to be useless, F.E.A.R. does not scale guns on a curve, so any firearm is potentially deadly in most situations. Monolith Productions stated that it aimed for [...] "... a balanced arsenal where each weapon serves a specific function", rather than [...] "... just going with a bunch of real-world submachine guns and assault rifles." [...] F.E.A.R.s heads-up display crosshair's size dynamically shows where shots will fall based on movement, aim, and the weapon in use. The player may carry only three firearms at a time; thus, strategy is required when using and selecting weapons.|$|E

The handsets could not operate as promoted until the entire {{constellation of satellites}} was in place, requiring a massive initial capital cost running into the billions of dollars. [...] The cost of service was prohibitive for many users, reception indoors was difficult and the <b>bulkiness</b> and expense of the hand held devices when compared to terrestrial cellular mobile phones discouraged adoption among potential users.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982, the California Highway Patrol {{asked the}} Ford Motor Company {{to produce a}} capable and {{lightweight}} police car due to the <b>bulkiness</b> of current police cars like the Ford Fairmont and LTD/Crown Victoria and the problems incurred with Chevrolet Camaros with their camshafts and engine problems at pursuit speeds. [...] Taking the Fox 5.0 Mustangs in production at the time, Ford produced the Ford Mustang SSP and modified them to suit {{the needs of the}} police and law enforcement departments.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{major issue}} of photojournalism is photo manipulation– what degree is acceptable? Some {{pictures}} are simply manipulated for color enhancement, whereas others are manipulated {{to the extent}} where people are edited {{in or out of}} the picture. War photography has always been a genre of photojournalism that is frequently staged – see [...] for early examples. Due to the <b>bulkiness</b> and types of cameras present during past wars in history, it was rare when a photograph could capture a spontaneous news event. Subjects were carefully composed and staged in order to capture better images. Another ethical issue is false or misleading captioning. The 2006 Lebanon War photographs controversies is a notable example of some of these issue, and see [...] for other examples.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1830s, fashionable women's {{clothing}} styles had distinctive large [...] "leg of mutton" [...] or [...] "gigot" [...] sleeves, above large full conical skirts, ideally with a narrow, low waist between (achieved through corseting). [...] The <b>bulkiness</b> of women's garments both {{above and}} below the waist was intended to make the waist look smaller than it was [...] this was the final repudiation of any last lingering aesthetic influences of the Empire silhouette of c. 1795–1825. [...] Heavy stiff fabrics such as brocades came back into style, and many 18th-century gowns were brought down from attics and cut up into new garments. [...] The combination of sloping shoulders and sleeves which were very large over most of the arm (but narrowing to a small cuff at the wrist) is quite distinctive to the day dresses of the 1830s.|$|E
2500|$|At first glance, the Pharaoh Hound appears both {{graceful and}} elegant {{as well as}} {{powerful}} and athletic. Its build is one of strength without <b>bulkiness</b> or excessive musculature. [...] Its head is elegant without being fine or extreme. [...] The skull resembles a blunt wedge, and is long and chiseled with only a slight stop and a snout of good length. [...] Its eyes are oval with a keen, alert, and intelligent expression. Their eyes are commonly amber-colored. [...] It has a long, lean, and muscular neck that is slightly arched. It has a deep chest that extends down to the elbows and a moderate tuck up. Its shoulders are long and well laid back. Its front legs are long and straight. The back legs are moderately angled, parallel to each other, and must be balanced with the forelegs. It has a long, fine, straight tail that reaches down to a bit below {{the point of the}} hocks, and has a whip-like shape. [...] The tail is carried down when relaxed. [...] When the dog is in motion or is excited, the tail is carried up; either level with, or loosely curled above, the back. Its dewclaws may be removed. The Pharaoh Hound's ears are very large and point upward when alert. They usually come in tan or chestnut colors. A white tail-tip is admired. Most commonly seen is any solid white spot on their neck, back, or shoulders. Mainly seen on the back or sides of the dog.|$|E

60|$|Cartwright's {{hair and}} {{mustache}} were white; {{his face was}} fleshy and red. He was fastidious about his clothes, and his tailor cleverly hid the <b>bulkiness</b> of his figure. As a rule, his look was fierce and commanding, but now and then his small keen eyes twinkled. Although Cartwright was clever, he was, in some respects, primitive. He had long indulged his appetites, and wore the stamp of what is sometimes called good living.|$|E

She {{realized that he was}} not a mystery, as she had excitedly believed; not a romantic messenger from the World Outside on whom she could count for escape. He belonged to Gopher Prairie, absolutely. She was snatched back from a dream of far countries, and found herself on Main Street.|$|E
60|$|Money, then, if {{imported}} solely as a merchandise, will, {{like other}} imported commodities, be of lowest {{value in the}} countries for whose exports there is the greatest foreign demand, and which have themselves the least demand for foreign commodities. To these two circumstances it is, however, necessary to add two others, which produce their effect through cost of carriage. The cost of obtaining bullion is compounded of two elements; the goods given to purchase it and the expense of transport; of which last, the bullion countries will bear a part (though an uncertain part) in the adjustment of international values. The expense of transport is partly that of carrying the goods to the bullion countries, and partly that of bringing back the bullion; both these items {{are influenced by the}} distance from the mines; and the former is also much affected by the <b>bulkiness</b> of the goods. Countries whose exportable produce consists of the finer manufactures obtain bullion, as well as all other foreign articles, cæteris paribus, at less expense than countries which export nothing but bulky raw produce.|$|E
60|$|One further {{implication}} must be noted. In a much-flattened or lens-shaped spheroid, {{the form}} of the ring will vary with its bulk. A very slender ring, taking off just the equatorial surface, will be hoop-shaped; while a tolerably massive ring, trenching appreciably on the diameter of the spheroid, will be quoit-shaped. Thus, then, according to the oblateness of the spheroid and the <b>bulkiness</b> of the detached ring, will the greatest thickness of that ring be in the direction of its plane, or in a direction perpendicular to its plane. But this circumstance must greatly affect the rotation of the resulting planet. In a decidedly hoop-shaped nebulous ring, the differences of velocity between the inner and outer surfaces will be small; and such a ring, aggregating into a mass of which the greatest diameter is at right angles to the plane of the orbit, will almost certainly give to this mass a predominant tendency to rotate in a direction at right angles to the plane of the orbit. Where the ring is but little hoop-shaped, and the difference between the inner and outer velocities greater, as it must be, the opposing tendencies--one to produce rotation in the plane of the orbit, and the other, rotation perpendicular to it--will both be influential; and an intermediate plane of rotation will be taken up. While, if the nebulous ring is decidedly quoit-shaped, and therefore aggregates into a mass whose greatest dimension lies in the plane of the orbit, both tendencies will conspire to produce rotation in that plane.|$|E
