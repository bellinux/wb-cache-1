5|$|Following the {{attempted}} assassination of Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981, Vice President George H. W. Bush did not assume the presidential powers and duties as Acting President. Reagan {{was unable to}} invoke Section 3, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> surgery. Bush did not invoke Section 4, because {{he was on a}} plane returning from Texas. Reagan was out of surgery by the time Bush arrived in Washington. In 1995, Birch Bayh, the primary sponsor of the amendment in the Senate, wrote that Section 4 should have been invoked.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} investigation {{concluded that}} the flight, regarded as a controlled flight into terrain, was caused by pilot errors {{and that there was}} no fault with the aircraft. Contributing factors causing the accident were lack of a procedure for offset localizer approach for setting approach course on the HSIs. Thus, both HSIs were set incorrectly, which along with the course deviation indicator hinted that the plane was being blown to the left and needed to adjust course to the right. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a stressed situation, the navigator set the GPS in the wrong mode. He also did not have sufficient time to recheck his work, allowing mistakes to happen, and his work was not monitored by the pilots. As the navigator was overworked, it was inappropriate for the first officer to transfer the responsibility of lateral control to him.|$|E
25|$|In November 1934, Goldmann petitioned Mussolini's {{support in}} {{relation}} to the Jews of the Saar, a region about to reunite with what was then Nazi Germany. In 1933, by a twist of fate, he managed to escape arrest by the Gestapo, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Palestine for his father's funeral.|$|E

25|$|St. Jerome was a Christian apologist whose {{writings}} contain two incidental {{references to}} the Attacotti. His account is particularly noteworthy <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Roman Gaul c.365-369/70, while the Attacotti {{were known to be}} in Britain until 368 and may have entered Roman military service soon after. Thus it is credible that Jerome had seen Attacotti soldiers and had heard Roman accounts of the recent fighting in Britain.|$|E
25|$|On August 13, 1862, Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith's Army of East Tennessee invaded Kentucky and on August 28, 1862, Confederate General Braxton Bragg's Army of Mississippi entered Kentucky, {{beginning}} the Kentucky Campaign (also {{known as the}} Confederate Heartland Offensive). The Confederates won the bloody Battle of Perryville, but Bragg retreated <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> an exposed position. Kentucky stayed under Union control {{for the remainder of}} the war.|$|E
25|$|The stage from Luchon to Carcassonne in 1962 set off 10 {{minutes later}} than {{scheduled}} because the German rider, Hans Junkermann, had been ill {{most of the}} night. At first he wasn't going to start. When he said that after all he felt well enough, the organisers gave him the extra time to get ready. Junkermann was leader of the Wiel's-Groene Leeuw team and was allowed his privilege <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> eighth position.|$|E

25|$|During the Second Mafia War of {{the early}} 1980s his boss, Stefano Bontade, was murdered along with {{hundreds}} of associates. Mannoia only survived <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> prison at the time for drug trafficking. He escaped from prison in 1983 {{with the help of}} his younger brother, a hitman named Agostino Marino Mannoia. They met with Corleonesi boss Salvatore Riina to establish their position in the dramatically altered landscape of the Sicilian Mafia and were both allowed to live and work under the auspices of the Corleonesi boss. Francesco Marino Mannoia became a major refiner of heroin for the Corleonesi.|$|E
25|$|In an 1882 {{by-election}} Davitt {{was elected}} Member of Parliament for County Meath but was disqualified <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> prison. On his release in 1882 he travelled to the United States with William Redmond to collect {{funds for the}} Land League, then campaigned for land nationalisation and an alliance between the British working class, Irish labourers and tenant farmers. This alienated Parnell and even many of the tenants, but after a meeting with Parnell at Parnell's house, Avondale, in September 1882 he agreed to co-operate with Parnell and set aside his plans for land nationalisation.|$|E
25|$|An {{experienced}} businessman, Goodman helped Henderson in 1934 {{when the}} Henderson orchestra disbanded. He let Henderson write arrangements, which Fletcher, his brother Horace and wife, Leora, usually copied {{from his own}} records, as Fletcher had almost no scores left. The Henderson method usually had been head arrangements. Goodman hired Henderson's band members to teach his musicians {{how to play the}} music. In 1932, his career began with Fletcher Henderson. Although Henderson’s orchestra was at its height of creativity, it had not reached any peaks of popularity. During the Depression, Fletcher disbanded his orchestra <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> debt.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1327 Bulgaria {{became involved in the}} third and final stage of the Byzantine civil war of 1321–1328 between Andronikos II and his grandson Andronikos III. Despite the inconsistent Serbian policy in his assistance, the old emperor managed to negotiate the support of the Serbian king Stephen Dečanski which urged Andronikos III to tighten his relations with the Emperor of Bulgaria. Michael Shishman, who fought against Andronikos III three years earlier, was interested to help <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> strained relations with Serbia after his divorce with Anna Neda and was disturbed by the marriage of Stephen Dečanski to the cousin of the old emperor Maria Palaiologina.|$|E
25|$|On 3 May 2010, Lee {{enlisted in}} the Republic of Korea Army to serve his {{mandatory}} military service. He first underwent five weeks of basic training at Nonsan military training camp and was later drafted into active duty. He had initially applied for a postponement <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the midst of shooting Grand Prix with actress Kim Tae-hee, and was cast to star in television drama Faith. He was also chosen to represent Korea as a goodwill ambassador at the 2010 Shanghai Expo. However, Military Manpower Administration declined and sent a final notice for enlistment, leading him {{to pull out of}} both projects. He served within the public relations department of the Ministry of National Defense.|$|E
25|$|J.D. Tippit (September 18, 1924 – November 22, 1963) was an American {{police officer}} who was an 11-year veteran with the Dallas Police Department. About 45 minutes after the {{assassination}} of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, Tippit {{was shot to death}} in a residential neighborhood in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas. Lee Harvey Oswald was initially arrested for the murder of Tippit and was subsequently arrested for the killing of President Kennedy. Oswald was charged with both crimes shortly after his arrest. However, Oswald denied involvement in either of the cases. Oswald could not be prosecuted for either crime <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> police custody two days after the assassination when he was shot and killed by nightclub owner Jack Ruby.|$|E
5000|$|... 4 years ago, he {{departed}} from Sol Ciel with Krusche and Jakuri. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> now at Sol Cluster with Krusche, apparently, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> love with her, despite his flirtious nature being still the same.|$|R

25|$|Initially, when Sima Zhao {{wanted to}} put Zhong Hui in charge of leading the Wei army to conquer Shu, Shao Ti (邵悌) warned him that Zhong Hui might rebel against Wei <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> command of an army of thousands, was single, and had no family to worry about. Sima Zhao laughed and said he {{understood}} Shao Ti's concern very well, but chose to let Zhong Hui lead the Wei army because he had faith in Zhong's ability to conquer Shu. He also predicted that Zhong Hui would not succeed even if he rebelled because of two reasons. First, the people of Shu would not support Zhong Hui because they were already fearful after witnessing the fall of Shu. Second, the Wei forces would not support Zhong Hui because they were already exhausted and homesick after the campaign.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Thurlow Weed, an anti-Masonic and anti-Andrew Jackson (Jackson was a Mason) movement grew to become the Anti-Masonic Party and made the ballot for the presidency in 1828 while gaining the support of such notable politicians as William H. Seward. Its influence was such that other Jackson rivals, including John Quincy Adams, denounced the Masons. In 1847, Adams wrote a widely distributed book titled Letters on the Masonic Institution that was {{highly critical of the}} Masons. In 1832, the party fielded William Wirt as its presidential candidate. This was rather ironic <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> fact, a Freemason, and even gave a speech at the Anti-Masonic convention defending the organization. The party only received seven electoral votes. Three years later, the party had disbanded in every state save Pennsylvania, as other issues such as slavery had become the focus of national attention.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{relative}} {{success of his}} third book of verse, Berryman's great poetic breakthrough occurred after he published 77 Dream Songs in 1964. It won the 1965 Pulitzer Prize for poetry and solidified Berryman's standing {{as one of the}} most important poets of the post-World War II generation that included Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Bishop, and Delmore Schwartz. Soon afterwards, Berryman started receiving a great deal of national attention from the press, from arts organizations, and even from the White House which sent him an invitation to dine with President Lyndon B. Johnson (though Berryman had to decline <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Ireland at the time). Berryman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1967, and that same year Life magazine ran a feature story on him. Also, that year the newly created National Endowment for the Arts awarded him a ten thousand dollar grant (though he admitted, when asked about the award by a Minneapolis reporter, that he had never heard of the organization before).|$|E

25|$|Professor Montagnier, the co-discoverer of the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (H.I.V), {{testified that}} the virus in the 393 {{children}} studied is a rare type found mostly in West Africa, but also throughout the continent. Montagnier told the court that the outbreak was probably started by an infected child admitted for treatment at the hospital. He said that injection {{was not the only}} possible means of infection, any other manipulation involving penetration of the skin, or even multiple use of the same oxygen mask, could have transmitted the virus. Montagnier was certain that the epidemic at the hospital started about a year before the Bulgarian nurses were hired. He said he was familiar with the case before his first visit to Libya in 1999 <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the process of studying the cases of hundreds of HIV-positive children from El-Fatih that were being examined or treated in hospitals in Switzerland, France, and Italy. At the time he was working on these cases, some of the children did not yet have the symptoms because the incubation period of the virus is about 10 years.|$|E
500|$|Gröning {{does not}} {{consider}} himself guilty of any crime, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> no way {{directly involved in the}} killing. He describes his part in the extermination machine as an involuntary [...] "small cog in the gears", which gave him involuntary guilt in turn. Citing his summons to testify against a member of the SS accused of murdering prisoners at Auschwitz, he also says he is innocent {{in the eyes of the}} law, pointing to the fact that he spoke as a witness and not as a defendant.|$|E
500|$|Despite Tolkien's {{statements}} in The Hobbit that Elves (and Hobbits) have no beards, Círdan in fact has a beard, {{which appears to}} be an anomaly and a simple oversight. However, Tolkien later devised at least [...] three [...] "cycles of life" [...] for Elves around 1960; Círdan had a beard <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his third cycle of life. (Mahtan, Nerdanel's father, had a beard in his second cycle of life, a rare phenomenon.) [...] It is unclear what these cycles exactly are, since Tolkien left no notes further explaining this. Apparently, beards were the only sign of further natural physical ageing beyond maturity.|$|E
