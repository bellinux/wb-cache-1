25|$|Fearing that Pridis's liberal wing, {{who had the}} {{majority}} in the National Assembly, would decide to take a decision, Phraya Manopakorn dissolved the parliament in April, imposed the emergency, and rescinded the constitutional part, which had not yet <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> old. He imposed a law against Communist activities, which was directed not so much against the almost insignificant Communist Party of Thailand, but rather against the alleged Communist projects Pridis. However, the younger officers of the Khana Ratsadon resisted and countered the oppressive actions of Phraya Manopakorn lead to another coup d'état only one year later, in June 1933, resulting in the appointment of Phraya Phahon as Siam's second prime minister.|$|E
25|$|Saša is in {{a three-year}} {{relationship}} with bookish medical doctor Branka, but his job prospects are bleak. It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> since he graduated law school with average grades {{and he still}} hasn't been able to land a job. Numerous rejections are starting to affect his self-confidence and he's beginning to feel inadequate in front of Branka who graduated medicine with top marks the same year he did, but, unlike him, right away found a job that she's now excelling at. Furthermore, Branka's parents, especially mother, rarely miss an opportunity {{to tell him about}} it. At the unemployment bureau counter, he meets a flirty and mouthy clerk Koka who chats him up. For his part, he seems very receptive to her relaxed, direct, slightly low-brow, and provocative approach as she seems a polar opposite of his straight-laced girlfriend Branka. While out with Branka one day at a bar, Koka bumps into two of them, saying a flirty hello to Saša followed by a testy chat with Branka who is completely rattled by this encounter.|$|E

25|$|Lloyd George {{was accused}} (in the Maurice Debate of 9 May 1918 in the House of Commons, after Maurice's public {{accusation}} three days earlier) of having hoarded {{troops in the}} UK {{to make it harder}} for Haig to launch offensives. Lloyd George misled the House of Commons in claiming that Haig's forces were stronger (1.75 million men) at the start of 1918 than they had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> earlier (1.5 million men) - in fact the increase was caused by an increase of 335,000 in the number of labourers (many of them Chinese, Indians and black South Africans), and Haig had fewer combat infantry (630,000, down from 900,000 a year earlier), holding a longer stretch of front (the rest of Haig's men would have been tank, air & artillery crews and above all logistical support personnel). Although Maurice - who certainly collaborated with Robertson - visited Haig shortly before his press letter, there is no specific evidence that Haig collaborated with his actions. Haig wrote to his wife that he had opposed Maurice in taking his concerns into public, but he was privately disappointed at how Lloyd George was able to get off the hook with a “claptrap speech”. Maurice believed he had saved Haig from dismissal.|$|E

[...] My War polarized Black Flag fans; it alienated those who wanted the band to stay true to its simple hardcore roots and who were {{put off by the}} length of the songs, the riff-heaviness, and the solos—elements widely thought of as un-punk. [...] Tim Yo disparaged the album in Maximumrocknroll, saying [...] "it sounds like Black Flag doing an imitation of Iron Maiden imitating Black Flag on a bad day", and called the B-side [...] "sheer torture".

[...] Following the first season, Atwell noted that Carter did not [...] "win everyone’s respect", with Jack Thompson taking credit for her actions, for example, but [...] "she knows her value so she doesn’t need that praise". For the second season, executive producer Michele Fazekas explained that after Carter [...] "put a lot of things emotionally to bed", such as letting go of Captain America, she is now [...] "more open to looking at her life and figuring out, does she want a relationship?" [...] Fazekas added that Carter would start to realize that [...] "not everybody has her ideals", even in the SSR.|$|E
500|$|Tubman {{was born}} Araminta [...] "Minty" [...] Ross to slave parents, Harriet ("Rit") Green and Ben Ross. Rit {{was owned by}} Mary Pattison Brodess (and later her son Edward). Ben was held by Anthony Thompson, who became Mary's second husband, and who ran a large {{plantation}} near Blackwater River in Madison, Maryland. As with many slaves in the United States, neither the exact year nor place of Araminta's birth is known, and historians differ as to the best estimate. Kate Larson records the year as 1822, based on a midwife payment and several other historical documents, including her runaway advertisement, while Jean Humez says [...] "the best current evidence suggests that Tubman was born in 1820, but it might have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> or two later." [...] Catherine Clinton notes that Tubman reported the year of her birth as 1825, while her death certificate lists 1815 and her gravestone lists 1820. In her Civil War widow's pension records, Tubman claimed {{she was born in}} 1820, 1822, and 1825, an indication, perhaps, that she had only a general idea of when she was born.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1943, {{during the}} Tripartite Dinner Meeting at the Tehran Conference, the Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, {{proposed}} executing 50,000–100,000 German staff officers.

2500|$|The near-debacle of March 1918 was {{an object}} of {{political}} controversy. Repington wrote that it was [...] "the worst defeat {{in the history of}} the Army". Bonar Law claimed in a House of Commons debate (23 April) that Haig and Petain had agreed the extension of the British line, which was not wholly true as in January 1918 the Supreme War Council had ordered a longer extension than Haig and Petain had agreed between themselves in December 1917, only leaving them to sort out the details. Lloyd George was accused (in the Maurice Debate of 9 May 1918 in the House of Commons, after Maurice's public accusation three days earlier) of having hoarded troops in the UK to make it harder for Haig to launch offensives.

2500|$|Probably {{the most}} {{fundamental}} guarantee that directors will act in the members' interests {{is that they can}} easily be sacked. During the Great Depression, two Harvard scholars, Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means wrote The Modern Corporation and Private Property, an attack on American law which failed to hold directors to account, and linked the growing power and autonomy of directors to the economic crisis. In the UK, the right of members to remove directors by a simple majority is assured under s.168 CA 2006 Moreover, Art.21 of the Model Articles requires a third of the board to put themselves up for re-election every year (in effect creating maximum three year terms). 10% of shareholders can demand a meeting any time, and 5% can if it has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> since the last one (s.303 CA 2006). In Germany, where employee participation creates the need for greater boardroom stability, §84(3) AktG states that management board directors can only be removed by the supervisory board for an important reason (ein wichtiger Grund) though this can include a vote of no-confidence by the shareholders. Terms last for five years, unless 75% of shareholders vote otherwise. §122 AktG lets 10% of shareholders demand a meeting. In the US, Delaware lets directors enjoy considerable autonomy. §141(k) DGCL states that directors can be removed without any cause, unless the board is [...] "classified", meaning that directors only come up for re-appointment on different years. If the board is classified, then directors cannot be removed unless there is gross misconduct. Director's autonomy from shareholders is seen further in §216 DGCL, which allows for plurality voting and §211(d) which states shareholder meetings can only be called if the constitution allows for it. The problem is that in America, directors usually choose where a company is incorporated and §242(b)(1) DGCL says any constitutional amendment requires a resolution by the directors. By contrast, constitutional amendments can be made at any time by 75% of shareholders in Germany (§179 AktG) and the UK (s.21 CA 2006).|$|E
