Schicchi sinks his tusks into Capocchio's neck and drags him away like prey. Griffolino {{explains}} how Myrrha disguised herself to commit incest {{with her father}} King Cinyras, while Schicchi impersonated the dead Buoso Donati to dictate a will giving himself several profitable bequests. Dante then encounters Master Adam of Brescia, one of the Counterfeiters (Falsifiers of Money): for manufacturing Florentine florins of twenty-one (rather than twenty-four) carat gold, he was {{burned at the stake}} in 1281. He is punished by a loathsome dropsy-like disease, which gives him a bloated stomach, prevents him from moving, and an eternal, unbearable thirst. Master Adam points out two sinners of the fourth class, the Perjurers (Falsifiers of Words). These are Potiphar's wife (punished for her false accusation of Joseph, Gen. 39:7-19) and Sinon, the Achaean spy who lied to the Trojans to convince them to take the Trojan Horse into their city (Aeneid II, 57-194); Sinon is here rather than in Bolgia 8 because his advice was false as well as evil. <b>Both</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> burning fever.

However, <b>both</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> lack of theoretical foundations and their interplay remains unclear. Drawing on a transdisciplinary literature review, we propose a conceptual framework to fill this gap. We propose that sustainable development corresponds {{to a combination of}} micro-quality of life improvement and macro-quality of life sustainment, the latter requiring continuous identification and positive addressing of institutional paradoxical tensions of inclusion. We explain that such tensions can give rise to various types of responses, which contribute together to institutional change. We argue that social innovations correspond to one specific type of such responses, that is, agent-driven positive responses. We suggest that societies in which culture naturally leans towards awareness and acceptance of paradox tend to be more socially innovative. Finally, three theoretical contributions and one methodological one are highlighted and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Coroutine {{pipelines}} {{provide an}} attractive structuring mechanism for complex programs that process streams of data, with the advantage over lazy streams that {{both ends of}} a pipeline may interact with the I/O system, as may processes in the middle. Two popular Haskell libraries, Pipes and Conduit, support such pipelines. In both libraries, pipelines are implemented in a direct style by combining a free monad of communication events with an interpreter for (pseudo-) parallel composition that interleaves the events of its argument processes. These implementations <b>both</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> slow-down when processes are deeply nested in sequence or in parallel. We propose an alternative implementation of pipelines based on continuations that does not suffer from this slow-down.

The continuation-based implementation may be derived from the direct-style implementation by algebraic reasoning...|$|E

Greek atomism dates back to the Greek philosopher Democritus, who declared that matter is composed of indivisible and indestructible atoms around 380 BC. Leucippus also declared that atoms were the most indivisible part of matter. This coincided with a similar declaration by Indian philosopher Kanada in his Vaisheshika sutras around the same time period. In much the same fashion he discussed the existence of gases.

To illustrate the discussion, a case study from a light rail system is analysed, exemplifying the effect of a contractual renegotiation. The authors argue that contractual renegotiation can be useful in decreasing contract incompleteness, but a poor design of these clauses can allow for opportunistic behaviour by concessionaires...|$|E

With zero-day {{attacks on the}} rise, randomization techniques have been introduced to diversify software and operation systems of networked hosts so that attacks that succeed on one process or one host cannot succeed on others. Two most notable system-wide random-ization techniques are Instruction Set Randomization (ISR) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). The former randomizes instruction set for each process, while the latter randomizes the memory address space layout. <b>Both</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> number of attacks. In this paper, we advocate and demonstrate that by combining ISR and ASLR effectively, we can offer much more robust protection than each of them individually. However, trivial combination of both schemes is not sufcient. To this end, we make the key observation that system call instructions matter the most to attackers for code injection. Our system, RandSys, uses system call instruction randomization and the general technique of ASLR along {{with a number of}} new enhancements to thwart code injection attacks. We have built a prototype for both Linux and Windows platforms. Our experiments show that RandSys can effectively thwart a wide variety of code injection attacks with a small overhead...|$|E

The statistical analysis of strong gravitational lensing from a complete and well defined set selection provides an opportunity for studying the largest structure in the universe and addresses issues raised in previous lensing cluster analysis.

40|$|Background: Although human torque teno viruses (TTVs) {{were first}} {{discovered}} in 1997, still many associated aspects are not clarified yet. The viruses reveal a remarkable heterogeneity {{and it is}} possible that some genotypes are more pathogenic than others. The identification of all genotypes is essential to confirm previous pathogenicity data, and an unbiased search for novel viruses is needed to identify TTVs that might be related to disease. Method: The virus discovery technique VIDISCA- 454 was used to screen serum of 55 HIV- 1 positive injecting drug users, from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies, in search for novel blood-blood transmittable viruses which are undetectable via normal diagnostics or panvirus-primer PCRs. Results: A novel torque teno mini virus (TTMV) was identified in two patients and the sequence of the full genomes were determined. The virus is significantly different from the known TTMVs (< 40 % amino acid identity in ORF 1), yet it contains conserved characteristics that are also present in other TTMVs. The virus is chronically present in both patients, and these patients <b>both</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pneumococcal pneumonia during follow up and had extremely low B-cells counts. Conclusion: We describe a novel TTMV which we tentatively named TTMV- 13. Further research is needed to address the epidemiology and pathogenicity of this novel virus...|$|R

40|$|The catastrophic economic, {{social and}} {{political}} crisis of our time calls for a new and original critique of political economy - a rethinking of Marx's project in the very different conditions of twenty-first century capitalism. Stiegler argues that today the proletarian must be reconceptualized as the economic agent whose knowledge and memory are confiscated by machines. This new {{sense of the term}} ‘proletarian' is best understood by reference to Plato's critique of exteriorized memory. By bringing together Plato and Marx, Stiegler can show how a generalized proletarianization now encompasses not only the muscular system, as Marx saw it, but also the nervous system of the so-called creative workers in the information industries. The proletarians of the former are deprived of their practical know-how, whereas the latter are shorn of their theoretical practice, and <b>both</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> confiscation of the very possibility of a genuine art of living. But the mechanisms at work in this new and accentuated form of proletarianization are the very mechanisms that may spur a reversal of the process. Such a reversal would imply a crucial distinction between one's life work, originating in otium (leisure devoted to the techniques of the self), and the job, consisting in a negotium (the negotiation and calculation, increasingly restricted to short-term expectations), leading to the necessity of a new conception of economic value.

40|$|This thesis will {{evaluate}} the cogency {{and value of}} Nietzsche’s idea of eternal return, which he saw as the pinnacle of his philosophical enterprise, {{as an antidote to}} the passive nihilism which results from the ‘death of God’ and the collapse of our once cherished Christian moral values. The centrality and importance of the eternal return in Nietzsche’s philosophy will be assessed. Firstly, the significance of the idea of the eternal return, when presented as an imaginative thought experiment, cosmological hypothesis, and poetic metaphor will be analysed. The importance of eternal return as a cosmology will be further evaluated, in terms of its roles in giving credibility to the thought of eternal return and in acting as a model of time in opposition to a linear Christian timeline. A review of criticisms of the cosmology, including Georg Simmel’s groundbreaking critique, will be conducted. The doctrine will be defended against the charges that it lacks coherence, that {{there is a lack of}} evidence for its reality, that it is fatalistic and that it invites indifference. The strength of metaphorical meaning contained within Heraclitean and Stoic cosmologies and their influence on Nietzsche’s cosmology, as well as their more holistic approach to life which Nietzsche wished to foster, are also discussed. Secondly, two of the most important and influential interpretations of Nietzsche’s eternal return of the twentieth century, those of Gilles Deleuze and Martin Heidegger, will be critically engaged with. Whereas Deleuze interprets eternal return as a highly ethical and selective thought, which acts like a centrifugal wheel in expelling all ‘reactive’ forces and nihilism and only allowing the return of ‘active’ forces, Heidegger interprets eternal return as the consummation of metaphysics and so nihilism, representing its peak rather than its overcoming. Although both interpretations enable a much profounder understanding of eternal return, <b>both</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> comparable one-sidedness and failure to appreciate certain essential aspects of Nietzsche’s philosophy of eternal recurrence. ...|$|E
40|$|Copper {{metallization}} {{has emerged}} as the leading interconnect technology for deep sub-micron features, where electroplating and chemical mechanical polish (CMP) processes have a vital role in the fabrication of integrated circuits. The processes <b>both</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> similar problem: the copper electroplated profiles and the polished surface exhibit pattern dependent topography. In this thesis, a methodology for the characterization and modeling of pattern dependent problems in copper interconnect topography is developed. For the electroplating process, the methodology consists of test structure and mask design to examine feature scale copper step height and the height of copper array regions as a function of underlying layout parameters. Semi-empirical response surface models are then generated with model parameters extracted from conventional and superfill plating processes. Once the models are calibrated, layout parameters including pattern density, line width distributions, and line length are extracted for each cell in a 40 gm by 40 tm discretization of any random chip layout. Then, a chip-scale prediction is achieved by simulating generalized average heights for each grid cell across the entire chip. The prediction result shows root mean square errors of less than 1000 A for array height and around 500 A for step height. This methodology provides the first known chip-scale prediction of electroplated topography. For pattern dependencies in copper CMP, this thesis focuses on the development of test structures and masks (including multi-level structures) to identify key pattern effects in both single-level and multi-level polishing. (cont.) Especially for the multi-level studies, electrical test structures and measurements in addition to surface profile scans are seen to be important in accurately determining thickness variations. The developed test vehicle and characterization of copper dishing and oxide erosion serve as a basis for further pattern dependent model development. Finally, integration of electroplating and CMP chip-scale models is illustrated; the simulated step and array heights as well as topography pattern density are used as an input for the initial starting topography for CMP simulation of subsequent polishing profile evolution. by Tae Hong Park.

40|$|Interference is {{a central}} {{phenomenon}} in wireless networks of all types, occurring whenever multiple users attempt to communicate over a shared medium. Current state-of-the-art systems rely on two basic approaches: orthogonalizing communication links, or treating interference as noise. These approaches <b>both</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> swift degradation in performance {{as the number of}} users in the system grows large. Recently, interference alignment has emerged as a promising new perspective towards mitigating interference. The extent of the potential benefit of interference alignment was observed by Cadambe and Jafar (2008), who showed that for time-varying or frequency selective channels, K/ 2 total degrees of freedom are achievable in a K-user interference channel. In the context of the result, this means that interference causes essentially no degradation at all in performance as the number of users grows. However, a caveat is that the number of independent channel realizations needed over time or frequency, i. e. the channel diversity, is unbounded. Actual communication systems have only finite channel diversity, and thus the practical implications of interference alignment are uncertain: Just how much channel diversity is required in order to get substantial benefit from interference alignment? The first part of this thesis focuses on this question. Our first result characterizes the degrees of freedom for the three-user interference channel as a function of time or frequency diversity. We next focus on spatial diversity, in the form of multiple antennas at transmitters and receivers. We characterize the degrees of freedom for the symmetric three-user multiple-input multiple-output interference channel. This result is partially generalized to an arbitrary number of users, under a further symmetry assumption. The second part of this thesis studies DNA sequencing from an information theory point-of-view. DNA sequencing is the basic workhorse of modern day biology and medicine. Shotgun sequencing is the dominant technique used: many randomly located short fragments called reads are extracted from the DNA sequence, and these reads are assembled to reconstruct the original sequence. During the last two decades, many assembly algorithms have been proposed, but comparing and evaluating them is difficult. To clarify this, we ask: Given N reads of length L sampled from an arbitrary DNA sequence, is it possible to achieve some target probability 1 -epsilon of successful reconstruction? We show that the answer depends on the repeat statistics of the DNA sequence to be assembled, and we compute these statistics for a number of reference genomes. We construct lower bounds showing that reconstruction is impossible for certain choices of N and L, and complement this by analytically deriving the performance of several algorithms, both in terms of repeat statistics. In seeking an algorithm that matches the lower bounds on real DNA data, we are able to methodically progress towards an optimal assembly algorithm. The goal of this work is to advocate a new systematic approach to the design of assemblyalgorithms with an optimality or near-optimality guarantee...|$|E

Biopsy specimens of bladder muscle stained for acetylcholinesterase revealed {{a significant reduction in}} cholinergic nerves compared with controls; however, the prominent cholinergic subepithelial plexus was strikingly preserved. These findings lend support to the view that acetylcholinesterase-containing nerves in the bladder muscle are motor fibres responsible for detrusor contraction, while those located in the subepithelium are sensory in function. Urethral sphincter electromyography revealed no abnormality of individual motor units, confirming that motor unit integrity in this muscle is dependent upon somatic rather than autonomic innervation. In the patient with pandysautonomia the proximal urethra was incompetent, while in the patient with cholinergic dysautonomia the bladder neck remained closed, as in controls. This suggests that sympathetic rather than parasympathetic efferent activity is necessary for the maintenance of proximal urethral competence...|$|R
40|$|Histogram (bag-of-words) and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) {{have been}} widely used in patch-based image {{classification}} problems. Despite the satisfactory results reported, <b>both</b> methods <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> number of disadvantages. For instance, a histogram may be easy to learn but has a large quantization error; on the contrary, Gaussian mixture model based methods have better modeling capabilities but are inefficient in both learning and testing. In this thesis, we present a novel hierarchical density estimation approach for image classification. This new approach partitions the feature space into small regions using a tree structure. For each region, "local" distribution is characterized by class-conditional Gaussians via hierarchical maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. We further enhance the parameter estimation by smoothing over a collection of randomized trees. This new approach enjoys the merits of superior modeling capability, robust parameter estimation, and efficient testing. Experiments on scene classification demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of this new approach...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop an}} index theory for {{parabolic}} and collision {{solutions to the}} classical n-body problem and we prove sufficient conditions for the finiteness of the spectral index valid in a large class of trajectories ending with a total collapse or expanding with vanishing limiting velocities. <b>Both</b> problems <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> lack of compactness and can be brought in a similar form of a Lagrangian System on the half time line by a regularising change of coordinates which preserve the Lagrangian structure. We then introduce a Maslov-type index which is suitable to capture the asymptotic nature of these trajectories as half-clinic orbits: by {{taking into account the}} underlying Hamiltonian structure we define the appropriate notion of geometric index for this class of solutions and we develop the relative index theory. We finally compute the Morse index for a class of collision and parabolic motions in Celestial Mechanics. Comment: 35 pages, 2 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
