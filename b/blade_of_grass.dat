5|$|Drummond's wartime {{experience}} {{had given him}} a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a single <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man with his bare hands in a second". During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player. In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.|$|E

The band also released an album called The <b>Blades</b> <b>of</b> <b>Grass</b> Are Not for Smoking before disbanding.|$|R

25|$|One <b>Blade</b> <b>of</b> <b>Grass</b> {{depicts a}} {{situation}} in which the rich wife of a military officer treats a child servant like a slave or actually more like a household appliance. There's a lot of hyperbole in the treatment of master-servant relations here, but the story does a good job at bringing out the features of oppression that one often finds in countries where income inequalities are extreme.|$|E

She knows how to defer to the wealth and status of the wealthy neighbors that {{surround}} her and cater to their every need, but it does her little good in the end.|$|E

25|$|Resistance to {{the invaders}} began to {{coalesce}} around {{a series of}} inaccessible towns and fortresses constructed in the mountainous interior of Ceylon. The fortress of Yapahuwa {{was one of the}} first of these, founded by the Senapathi (General) Subha; another was Gangadoni, founded by the general Sankha, barely 15 miles ('two yojanas') from Magha's capital. From these places the various nobles 'gave as little heed to the infamous army of the Ruler Magha, though...as to a <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> and protected without fear that district and the Order '.|$|E
25|$|There are {{legends of}} him (Khidr) in which, like Osiris, he is dismembered and reborn; and prophecies {{connecting}} him, like the Green Man, {{with the end}} of time. His name means the Green One or Verdant One, he is the voice of inspiration to the aspirant and committed artist. He can come as a white light or the gleam on a <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass,</b> but more often as an inner mood. The sign of his presence is the ability to work or experience with tireless enthusiasm beyond one's normal capacities. In this there may be a link across cultures, …one reason for the enthusiasm of the medieval sculptors for the Green Man may be that he was the source of every inspiration.|$|E
500|$|A large grasshopper, {{such as a}} locust, {{can jump}} about a metre (twenty body lengths) without using its wings; the {{acceleration}} peaks at about 20g. Grasshoppers jump by extending their large back legs and pushing against the substrate (the ground, a twig, a <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> or whatever else they are standing on); the reaction force propels them into the air. They jump for several reasons; to escape from a predator, to launch themselves into flight, or simply to move from place to place. For the escape jump in particular there is strong selective pressure to maximize take-off velocity, since this determines the range. This means that the legs must thrust against the ground with both high force and a high velocity of movement. [...] However, a fundamental property of muscle is that it cannot contract with both high force and high velocity at the same time. Grasshoppers overcome this apparent contradiction by using a catapult mechanism to amplify the mechanical power produced by their muscles.|$|E

50|$|More {{releases}} followed throughout 1968 {{that failed}} to chart, including their debut album, The <b>Blades</b> <b>of</b> <b>Grass</b> Are Not for Smoking. The <b>Blades</b> <b>of</b> <b>Grass</b> were especially subdued in the studio to other songwriters' material, though Black, the band's main composer, claimed to have penned nearly 100 songs during the group's existence. The album contained heavily orchestrated instrumentals and airy vocal harmonies that were coherent with many California-based sunshine groups. A few obscure non-LP singles were released in early 1969, but the <b>Blades</b> <b>of</b> <b>Grass,</b> after its members graduated high school, disbanded within the year. In 2002, Rev-Ola Records reissued the album, with the band's material from their non-LP singles included as bonus tracks.|$|R

500|$|Asher told Barbara Avedon {{about the}} {{students}}' script, {{saying that it}} only needed a little reworking, and he asked if she would help the students with the rewrite. Avedon, who had written for The Donna Reed Show and been a regular writer for Bewitched, accepted his request. Avedon visited Jefferson High School and later said of the experience, [...] "I was horrified. Locker doors were hanging off their hinges. There wasn't a <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> in sight." [...] Avedon expressed amazement over the script the students produced and helped them revise it and expand its length so it would sustain a full half-hour episode. She promised the students that no changes would {{be made to the}} script unless they approved. It was because of her recommendation that the story was reformulated as a Christmas episode, which she suggested because the script [...] "was so imbued with the spirit." [...] She said that one of the students indicated a desire to write for Bewitched because the series deals with miscegenation by way of a marriage between a witch and a mortal. [...] The final script credited the teleplay to Avedon and Asher, and the story to all 26 students, who were listed on screen in alphabetical order.|$|E
500|$|Recruiting animators for Toy Story was brisk; {{the magnet}} for talent {{was not the}} pay, {{generally}} mediocre, but rather the allure of {{taking part in the}} first computer-animated feature. Lasseter said that on the challenges of the computer animation in the film [...] "We had to make things look more organic. Every leaf and <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs." [...] The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was either created out of clay or was first modeled off of a computer-drawn diagram before reaching the computer animated design. Once the animators had a model, articulation and motion controls were coded; this would allow each character to move in a variety of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping. Out of all the characters, Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212 for his face and 58 for his mouth. The first piece of animation, a 30-second test, was delivered to Disney in June 1992, when the company requested a sample of what the film would look like. Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.|$|E

2500|$|Characteristic {{features}} of Ukiyo-e woodprints include their ordinary subject matter, the distinctive cropping of their compositions, bold and assertive outlines, absent or unusual perspective, flat regions of uniform colour, uniform lighting, absence of chiaroscuro, and {{their emphasis on}} decorative patterns. One {{or more of these}} features can be found in numbers of Vincent's paintings from his Antwerp period onwards. Van Gogh wrote, [...] "If we study Japanese art, we see a man who is undoubtedly wise, philosophical and intelligent, who spends his time… studying a single <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass.</b> [...] But this <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> leads him to draw every plant, and then the seasons, the wide aspects of the countryside, then animals, then the human figure… isn't it almost a true religion which these simple Japanese teach us, who live in nature as though they themselves are flowers.
