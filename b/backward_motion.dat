5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an explosive charge and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The <b>backward</b> <b>motion</b> of the cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.|$|E
25|$|Back-arc basins are {{hypothesized}} to form {{as a result}} of trench rollback (also, hinge rollback). This is the <b>backward</b> <b>motion</b> of the subduction zone relative to the motion of the plate which is being subducted. As the subduction zone and its associated trench pull backward, the overriding plate is stretched, thinning the crust which is manifest in the back-arc basin. Sedimentation is strongly asymmetric, with most of the sediment supplied from the active magmatic arc which regresses in step with the rollback of the trench.|$|E
25|$|The Serpent Mound {{may have}} been {{designed}} {{in accord with the}} pattern of stars composing the constellation Draco. The star pattern of the constellation Draco fits with fair precision to the Serpent Mound, with the ancient Pole Star, Thuban (α Draconis), at its geographical center within the first of seven coils from the head. The fact that the body of Serpent Mound follows the pattern of Draco may support various theses. Putnam's 1865 refurbishment of the earthwork could have been correctly accomplished in that a comparison of Romain's or Fletcher and Cameron's maps from the 1980s show how the margins of the Serpent align with great accuracy to a large portion of Draco. Some researchers date the earthwork to around 5,000 years ago, based on the position of Draco, through the <b>backward</b> <b>motion</b> of precessionary circle of the ecliptic when Thuban was the Pole Star. Alignment of the effigy to the Pole Star at that position also shows how true north {{may have been}} found. This was not known until 1987 because lodestone and modern compasses give incorrect readings at the site.|$|E

500|$|Some of the {{earliest}} recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent <b>backward</b> <b>motion</b> is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, {{the motion of the}} planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the [...] "star" [...] he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "lift" [...] mode for {{assisted}} vertical maneuvers, 29,000hp is diverted forward {{through a}} driveshaft from the engine's low-pressure (LP) turbine via a clutch and bevel-gearbox to a vertically mounted, contra-rotating lift fan located {{forward of the}} main engine. The fan efflux (low-velocity unheated air) discharges through a thrust vectoring nozzle {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, thus balancing the aft lift generated by the 3BSM. For lateral stability and roll control, bypass air from the engine goes out through a roll-post nozzle in each wing. For pitch control, the areas of exhaust nozzle and LiftFan inlet are varied conversely to change the balance between them while maintaining their sum, and with constant turbine speed. Yaw control is achieved by yawing the 3BSM. Forward, and even <b>backward,</b> <b>motion</b> is controlled by tilting the 3BSM and LiftFan outlet.|$|E

50|$|Because the ratchet {{can only}} stop <b>backward</b> <b>motion</b> at {{discrete}} points (i.e., at tooth boundaries), a ratchet does allow {{a limited amount}} of <b>backward</b> <b>motion.</b> This backward motion—which is limited to a maximum distance equal to the spacing between the teeth—is called backlash. In cases where backlash must be minimized, a smooth, toothless ratchet with a high friction surface such as rubber is sometimes used. The pawl bears against the surface at an angle so that any <b>backward</b> <b>motion</b> will cause the pawl to jam against the surface and thus prevent any further <b>backward</b> <b>motion.</b> Since the backward travel distance is primarily a function of the compressibility of the high friction surface, this mechanism can result in significantly reduced backlash.|$|E

40|$|In {{each round}} of {{translation}} elongation, tRNAs and mRNA move within the ribosome by one codon at a time. tRNA-mRNA translocation is promoted by elongation factor G (EF-G) {{at the cost}} of GTP hydrolysis. The key questions for understanding translocation are how and when the tRNAs move and how EF-G coordinates motions of the ribosomal subunits with tRNA movement. Here we present 2 recent papers which describe the choreography of movements over the whole trajectory of translocation. We present the view that EF-G accelerates translocation by promoting the steps that lead to GTPase-dependent ribosome unlocking. EF-G facilitates the formation of the rotated state of the ribosome and uncouples the <b>backward</b> <b>motions</b> of the ribosomal subunits, forming an open conformation in which the tRNAs can rapidly move. Ribosome dynamics are important not only in translocation, but also in recoding events, such as frameshifting and bypassing, and mediate sensitivity to antibiotics...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a real experiment in nonholonomic motion planning and control. It {{was performed on}} the mobile robot Hilare- 2 -bis pulling a trailer. 1 Introduction Nonholonomic robot motion planning and control have been very attractive research fields for 8 years (e. g., [8, 5]). The most popular example of nonholonomic systems is a mobile robot pulling trailers. Nevertheless there are very few papers reporting experimental results. In [10, 2] the experiments are carried out to evaluate various feedback control laws. In this paper we present a real experiment conducted on the mobile robot Hilare- 2 -bis of LAAS equipped with its trailer (Section 2). In this experiment, Hilare plans a collision-free path automatically and executes it. Section 3 presents a new dedicated and efficient motion planner. The principle of the feedback control consists in reducing the trajectory tracking problem (including both forward and <b>backward</b> <b>motions)</b> to trajectory tracking for a virtual robot moving [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{dynamics}} of a piecewise holonomic mechanical system: a discrete sister to the classical nonholonomically constrained Chaplygin sleigh. A slotted rigid body moves in the plane subject to a sequence of pegs intermittently placed and sliding freely along the slot; motions are smooth and holonomic except at instants of peg insertion. We derive a return map and analyze stability of constant-speed straight-line motions: they are asymptotically stable if the mass center {{is in front of}} the center of the slot, and unstable if it lies behind the slot; if it lies between center and rear of the slot, stability depends subtly on slot length and radius of gyration. As slot length vanishes, the system inherits the eigenvalues of the Chaplygin sleigh while remaining piecewise holonomic.
