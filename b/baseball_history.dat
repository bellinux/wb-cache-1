5|$|Eric Bruntlett {{turned the}} 15th unassisted triple {{play in the}} modern era of Major League <b>Baseball</b> <b>history.</b> It was the second in Phillies history (Mickey Morandini) and the second game-ending unassisted triple play (Johnny Neun, 1927).|$|E
5|$|Huggins handled 19 fielding chances, 11 putouts {{and nine}} assists, without {{committing}} {{an error in}} a game with the Saints in 1902; the previous Major League Baseball (MLB) record being 18, set by Fred Dunlap in 1882. In 1903, he pulled off the first delayed steal in recorded <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 2014, Posey and pitcher Madison Bumgarner hit grand slams {{against the}} Arizona Diamondbacks. It {{marked the first}} time in Major League <b>Baseball</b> <b>history</b> that a catcher and a pitcher hit grand slams in the same game.|$|E

5|$|On May 28, 1956, Dale Long of the Pirates {{took what}} one author has stated was the first-ever curtain call in <b>baseball</b> <b>history,</b> after hitting {{home runs in}} eight {{consecutive}} games caused fans to cheer for five minutes.|$|E
5|$|Pennock was {{regarded}} as one of the greatest left-handed pitchers in <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b> Mack later called his sale of Pennock to the Red Sox his greatest mistake. Pennock died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1948; later that year, he was posthumously inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Bonds {{left the}} Pirates {{to sign a}} lucrative free agent {{contract}} worth a then-record $43.75 million ($ million today) over six years with the Giants, with whom his father had spent the first seven years of his career, and with whom his godfather Willie Mays played 22 of his 24 Major League seasons. The deal {{was at that time}} the largest in <b>baseball</b> <b>history,</b> in terms of both total value and average annual salary.|$|E
25|$|The {{ratings for}} the 2008 World Series are among the worst in Major League <b>Baseball's</b> <b>history.</b> The 8.4 rating set a record low, sinking below the 10.1 set two years earlier in 2006. 2008 bears the {{distinction}} of being the first World Series to draw fewer than 10.0. Game three's 6.1 rating also set a record for the lowest rated individual game.|$|R
50|$|On December 16, 2008, the Mets officially {{announced}} that Ken Oberkfell {{would be the}} Bisons new manager for 2009. At the same press conference, the Bisons also unveiled their new logo. The logo paid homage to <b>baseball's</b> <b>history</b> {{in the city of}} Buffalo with the city's skyline in the background. The logo, along with the new colors of blue and orange, closely resemble that of the team's new parent club, the Mets.|$|R

5|$|In 2002, the Red Sox {{asked the}} Yankees for {{permission}} to interview one of George Steinbrenner's assistants, former Yankees general manager Gene Michael, for their vacant general manager position, but Steinbrenner declined their request. Boston Red Sox then hired Theo Epstein, a protégé of Red Sox President and CEO Larry Lucchino, as general manager, and at 28 years old, he was the youngest general manager in <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
5|$|In September, Kinsler tied his own Rangers record, {{which he}} set in 2009, with his seventh leadoff home {{run of the}} season. He also hit his 20th career leadoff homer, {{becoming}} the 34th player in major league <b>baseball</b> <b>history</b> to have hit at least 20. Since his first season in 2006, his 20 lead-off homers were the 6th-most behind Alfonso Soriano (31), Hanley Ramírez (25), Jimmy Rollins (24), Curtis Granderson (24), and Rickie Weeks (24).|$|E
5|$|Koufax was {{the first}} major league pitcher to pitch four no-hitters and the eighth pitcher to pitch a perfect game in <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b> Despite his {{comparatively}} short career, Koufax's 2,396 career strikeouts ranked 7th in history as of his retirement, trailing only Warren Spahn (2,583) among left-handers. Koufax, Randy Johnson, Pedro Martínez, and Nolan Ryan are the only four pitchers elected to the Hall of Fame who had more strikeouts than innings pitched.|$|E

50|$|America's National Game {{is a book}} by Albert Spalding, {{published}} in 1911 detailing {{the early history of}} the sport of baseball. Much of the story is told first-hand, since Spalding had been involved in the game, first as a player and later an administrator, since the 1850s. In addition to his personal recollections, he had access to the records of Henry Chadwick, the game's first statistician and archivist. Spalding was, however, known to aggrandise his role in the major moments in <b>baseball's</b> <b>history.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} for a baseball pitcher to achieve a perfect season, taking at least one win {{and any number of}} no-decisions throughout the year. This has happened 1813 times in <b>baseball’s</b> <b>history,</b> though the majority (1171) were 1-0 seasons, mostly by relief pitchers. The best perfect season belongs to Tom Zachary of the 1929 New York Yankees, who posted a 12-0 record in 119.2 innings. No pitcher has ever achieved a perfect season while qualifying for the ERA title.|$|R
5|$|On August 6, 1890, Young's {{major league}} debut, he pitched a three-hit 8 - 1 {{victory over the}} Chicago Colts. While Young was on the Spiders, Chief Zimmer was his catcher more often than any other player. Bill James, a {{baseball}} statistician, estimated that Zimmer caught Young in more games than any other battery in <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2005, {{while playing}} for the Red Sox, Youkilis took {{the field in the}} 9th inning along with Adam Stern and Gabe Kapler, setting a record for the most Jewish players on the field at one time in AL history, and the most in Major League <b>Baseball</b> <b>history</b> since four Jewish players took the field for the New York Giants in a game in 1941.|$|E
5|$|On July 12 and September 28, 1951, Reynolds threw no-hitters. He was {{the first}} American League pitcher to throw two no-hitters in a season and only the second player {{to do so in}} <b>baseball</b> <b>history,</b> after Johnny Vander Meer threw {{consecutive}} no-hitters in 1938. This is still the MLB record for most no-hitters in a single season, a record that Reynolds and Vander Meer share with Virgil Trucks (1952), Nolan Ryan (1973), Roy Halladay (2010), and Max Scherzer (2015).|$|E
50|$|The Red Sox, the 26th team in Major League <b>Baseball</b> playoff <b>history</b> {{to face a}} 3-0 series deficit, {{became the}} first to force a Game Seven.|$|R
5000|$|In 1877, he {{fell ill}} {{with what was}} then only {{described}} as an [...] "ague" [...] (fever), played only 22 games, and did not play well {{when he was in}} the lineup. The illness robbed Barnes of much of his strength and agility, and shortened his career. While many <b>baseball</b> <b>histories</b> originally blamed the change in rules that outlawed the [...] "fair-foul" [...] hit, of which Barnes was an acknowledged master, his illness has become a more widely accepted explanation for his loss of productivity.|$|R

5|$|The Merkle play {{remains one}} of the most famous in <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b> The ball used in the Merkle play was sold at an auction in the 1990s for $27,500, making it one of the four most {{valuable}} baseballs based on purchase price. Evers' role in Merkle's boner cemented his legacy as a smart ballplayer.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees did {{not reach}} the World Series in 1997, but came back {{with one of the}} better seasons in <b>baseball</b> <b>history</b> in 1998, which culminated in a win over the San Diego Padres in the 1998 World Series. The Red Sox, too, made the playoffs in 1998, but as a Wild Card, they did not seriously contend for the {{division}} title. They ultimately lost their ALDS.|$|E
5|$|Though Evers and Tinker {{were part}} {{of one of the most}} {{successful}} double-play combinations in <b>baseball</b> <b>history,</b> the two despised each other off of the field. They went several years without speaking to each other after one argument. When Chance once named Tinker the smartest ballplayer he knew, Evers took it as a personal affront.|$|E

25|$|Another {{major change}} {{that had been}} {{occurring}} during this time was {{the adoption of the}} pitch count. Starting pitchers playing complete games had not been an unusual thing in <b>baseball's</b> <b>history.</b> Now pitching coaches watched to see how many pitches a player had thrown over the game. At anywhere from 100 to 125, pitchers increasingly would be pulled out to preserve their arms. Bullpens began to specialize more, with more pitchers being trained as middle relievers, and a few hurlers, usually possessing high velocity but not much durability, as closers.|$|R
5|$|Wilhelm {{was nearly}} 30 {{years old when}} he entered the major leagues, and pitched until he was nearly 50. He retired with one of the lowest career earned run averages, 2.52, in <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b> After {{retiring}} as a player in 1972 Wilhelm held longtime coaching jobs with the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves. He lived in Sarasota, Florida for many years, and died there in 2002.|$|E
5|$|All {{three players}} were {{inducted}} into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. Their inductions have been credited to the fame generated by Adams' poem. Andy Coakley, a teammate with the Cubs {{as well as a}} coach for Columbia University, regarded Tinker, Evers, and Chance to be the best infield in <b>baseball</b> <b>history.</b> Bill James, in his 1994 book, Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?, argued that Tinker was less accomplished than George Davis, who at the time was {{not a member of the}} Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Banister {{began the}} 1991 season with Buffalo. The Pirates {{promoted}} Banister from {{the minor leagues}} on July 23, 1991, when catcher Don Slaught was injured and placed on the disabled list. Manager Jim Leyland used Banister as a pinch hitter for pitcher Doug Drabek {{in the eighth inning}} of that day's game against the Atlanta Braves at Three Rivers Stadium. Using Cecil Espy's bat, Banister hit a ball from Dan Petry and just beat shortstop Jeff Blauser's throw to first base. Banister is one of only 15 batters (excluding pitchers) in <b>baseball</b> <b>history</b> to record a hit in his only major league plate appearance.|$|E
5000|$|Browning was an {{important}} figure in <b>baseball's</b> <b>history.</b> In addition to his accomplishments as a player, which have made him a popular candidate for the Baseball Hall of Fame, his legacy is expressed in the game in other ways as well. Browning is probably best remembered today as the inspiration behind the Hillerich & Bradsby company's popular [...] "Louisville Slugger" [...] line of baseball bats. He was {{the first player to}} purchase a bat from the company, and they adopted the name a few years later to honor his patronage and capitalize on his fame.|$|R
50|$|Some {{baseball}} researches considers Kline one of {{the five}} best pitchers in All-American Girls Professional <b>Baseball</b> League <b>history,</b> along with Jean Faut, Helen Nicol, Dottie Wiltse and Connie Wisniewski.|$|R
