5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{they meet}} a rabbit named Cowslip, who invites {{them to join}} his warren. At first Hazel's group are {{relieved}} to finally <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> and feed well – all except for Fiver who senses only death there. When Bigwig is nearly killed in a snare, the group realize that the new warren is managed by a farmer who protects and feeds the rabbits, but also harvests {{a number of them}} for their meat and skins. The residents of the new warren are simply using Hazel and the others to increase their own odds of survival. Fiver {{and the rest of the}} group work together to rescue Bigwig from a snare, then continue on their journey, along with a rabbit from the new warren called Strawberry, who asks to join them after his doe is killed in a snare.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2016, Tesla {{expected}} to demonstrate full autonomy {{by the end of}} 2017. In April 2017 Musk predicted that in around two years drivers would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in their vehicle.|$|E

50|$|Illusionary Border Team (幻想の結界チーム) — Ever {{since the}} moon got {{replaced}} with a fake one, Yukari hasn't <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Because Yukari doesn't go out much, she had to rope Reimu in as a guide.|$|R
25|$|Safe {{technique}} should {{ensure that}} obstructive apnoea cannot occur. Since the mother must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> {{to provide adequate}} dose, this requires keeping the airway safely open, and close containment to mother’s bare chest using a garment, various of these are described in the WHO guidelines.|$|E
500|$|The high {{metabolic}} {{rates of}} birds during the active {{part of the}} day is supplemented by rest at other times. Sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vigilant sleep, where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye-opening [...] "peeks", allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats. Swifts are believed to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight. It has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight.|$|E
2500|$|Philippe married Elizabeth Charlotte, who {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism on 16 November 1671. She was not attractive, as Henrietta had been. When Philippe first saw her, {{he is said}} to have remarked [...] "how will I ever <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> with her?" [...] Madame de Sévigné noted how popular the new Madame was with the court. She became renowned for her brusque candor, upright character, and lack of vanity. Her letters record how willingly she gave up sharing Philippe's bed at his request after their children's births and how unwillingly she quietly endured the presence of his male favourites in their household.|$|E
60|$|One {{can imagine}} what joy there was when the two reached home. Everyone {{had been looking for}} them, and the big sister had not <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> for she thought the wolves had eaten them up.|$|R
60|$|For a {{whole week}} he <b>was</b> not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> well, so much the villainy which he had played upon his trusting mother preyed upon his rag of conscience; but after {{that he began to}} get {{comfortable}} again, and <b>was</b> presently <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> like any other miscreant.|$|R
500|$|Horses <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> both {{standing}} up and lying down. In an adaptation from life in the wild, horses <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> enter light <b>sleep</b> by using a [...] "stay apparatus" [...] in their legs, allowing them to doze without collapsing. Horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators. A horse kept alone will not sleep well because its instincts are to keep a constant eye out for danger.|$|R
2500|$|Homeostatic sleep {{propensity}} (the {{need for}} sleep {{as a function}} of the amount of time elapsed since the last adequate sleep episode) must be balanced against the circadian element for satisfactory sleep. [...] Along with corresponding messages from the circadian clock, this tells the body it needs to sleep. [...] A person who regularly awakens at an early hour will generally not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> much later than his or her normal waking time, even if moderately sleep-deprived. The timing is correct when the following two circadian markers occur after the middle of the sleep episode and before awakening: maximum concentration of the hormone melatonin, and minimum core body temperature.|$|E
2500|$|Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288 (1982), is a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} {{challenged}} the National Park Service's regulation which specifically prohibited sleeping in Lafayette Park and the National Mall. The [...] (CCNV) group {{had planned to}} hold a demonstration on the National Mall and Lafayette Park where they would erect tent cities {{to raise awareness of}} the situation of the homeless. The group obtained the correct permits for a seven-day demonstration starting {{on the first day of}} winter. The Park Service however denied the request that participants <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in the tents. The CCNV challenged this regulation on the basis that it violated their First Amendment right.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 July 2015, Cattrall {{was cast}} {{in the title role}} of the play Linda, written by Penelope Skinner, {{directed}} by Michael Longhurst, and produced at the Royal Court Theatre in London. [...] She was forced to drop out of that production {{a few days before the}} opening, due to “chronic, debilitating insomnia”. She then returned to New York, and started a program of cognitive behaviour therapy to train herself to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> better. The therapy was successful; it included developing certain evening rituals, removing electronic devices from her bedroom, and limiting the use of the bed to two activities, one of which would be sleeping. Her part in the play, Linda was recast, her part played by Noma Dumezweni, and it opened in December 2015.|$|E

60|$|That {{night the}} mother and {{daughter}} shared the same bed together, and Mrs. Ray <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> She would not confess to herself that her sorrow had been lightened, because nothing had been said or done to lessen that of her daughter; but on the morrow Rachel came and hovered round her again, and the bitterness of Mrs. Ray's grief was removed.|$|R
60|$|I was not minded {{to close}} my eyes in slumber until after having heard from the old sailor all he could tell, {{although}} {{it goes without saying}} that I was tired enough to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> standing up.|$|E

60|$|As {{the evening}} wore on I {{wondered}} if I would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> There {{was no use}} worrying about matters, as it would do no good, so I was inclined to treat the affair philosophically and {{make the best of}} it.|$|E
50|$|The hulders {{were held}} to be kind to {{charcoal}} burners, watching their charcoal kilns while they rested. Knowing that she would wake them {{if there were any}} problems, they <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> and in exchange they left provisions for her in a special place. A tale from Närke illustrates further how kind a hulder could be, especially if treated with respect (Hellström 1985:15).|$|R
60|$|Bessie slept soundly, from exhaustion, {{and in that}} {{provisional}} {{fashion in}} which people who have postponed a care to a given moment <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> But she woke early, and crept down-stairs before any one else was astir, {{and went to the}} library. The decanters stood there on the table, empty. Her brother lay a shapeless heap in one of the deep arm-chairs.|$|R
60|$|Three {{weeks at}} sea had done wonders for Mrs. Holland. Now {{that she was}} fairly {{embarked}} upon her quest, the expression of anxiety gradually died out.

Dick was delighted at the change in her.|$|R

Parties that do not offer a sleeping room generally allow sceners <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> under the tables.|$|R
50|$|Corona {{complained of}} chest pain from his cell in Yuba City, on June 18, {{and was taken}} to the hospital, where he was {{diagnosed}} with having had a mild heart attack.
