40|$|The {{realization}} that the total energy of GRBs is correlated to their jet <b>break</b> <b>angles</b> motivates {{the search for a}} similar relation between the peak luminosity, L, and the jet <b>break</b> <b>angles,</b> L ∝ θ − 2. Such a relation implies that the GRB luminosity function determines the angular distribution. We re-derive the GRB luminosity function using the BATSE peak flux distribution and compare the predicted distribution with the observed redshift distribution. The luminosity function can be approximated by two broken power laws with a break peak luminosity of 4. 4 × 10 51 erg/sec, a typical jet angle of 0. 12 rad and a local GRB rate of 0. 44 h − 3 65 Gpc− 3 yr − 1. The angular distribution implied by L ∝ θ − 2 agrees well with the observed one, and implies a correction factor to the local rate due to beaming of 75 ± 25 (instead of 500 as commonly used). The inferred overall local GRB rate is 33 ± 11 h − 3 65 Gpc− 3 yr − 1. The luminosity function and angle distribution obtained within the universal structured jet model, where the angular distribution is essentially ∝ θ and hence the luminosity function must be ∝ L − 2, deviate from the observations at low peak fluxes and, correspondingly, at large angles. The corresponding correction factor for the universal structure jet is ∼ 20 ± 10. Subject headings: cosmology:observations-gamma rays:bursts 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{two leading}} interpretations of {{achromatic}} breaks that are {{observed in the}} light curves of GRBs afterglow are (i) the manifestation of {{the edge of a}} jet, which has a roughly uniform energy profile and a sharp edge and (ii) a line of sight effect in jets with a variable energy profile. The first scenario requires the inner engine to produce a jet with a different opening angle each explosion, while the latter requires a standard engine. The physical structure of the jet is a crucial factor in understanding GRB progenitors, and therefore discriminating the two jet scenarios is particularly relevant. In the structured jet case, specific predictions can be made for the distribution of observed <b>break</b> <b>angles</b> θ_ break, while that distribution is arbitrary in the first scenario. We derive the theoretical distribution for the structured jet model. Specifically, we predict the most common angle to be about 0. 12 rad, in rough agreement with the sample. If this agreement would hold as the sample size increases, it would strengthen the case for the standard jet hypothesis. We show that a prediction of this model is that the average viewing angle is an increasing function of the survey sensitivity, and in particular that a mission like Swift will find the typical viewing angle to be about 0. 3 rad. The local event rate predicted by this model is R_ GRB(z= 0) ∼ 0. 5 Gpc^- 3 yr^- 1. Comment: 14 pages, 3 figures; accepted to Ap...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} that long gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets are structured receives growing attention recently, {{and we have}} suggested that most GRBs and their softer, less energetic fraternity, X-ray flashes (XRFs), can be understood within a quasi-universal structured jet picture, given that the jet structure for each individual burst is a Gaussian or similar function. Here we perform a global test on such a quasi-universal Gaussian-like structured jet by comparing Monte-Carlo simulation results with {{a broad spectrum of}} observational data. Using the same set of input parameters as in our previous work (Zhang et al. 2004), we confront the model with more observational constraints. These constraints include the burst redshift distribution, jet <b>break</b> <b>angle</b> distribution, two-dimensional redshift vs. jet <b>break</b> <b>angle</b> distribution, luminosity function, and Log N - Log P distribution. The results indicate that the model is generally compatible with the data. This conclusion, together with our previous tests with the observed jet <b>break</b> <b>angle</b> vs. isotropic energy and observed peak energy vs. fluence relations, suggests that current long GRB and XRF data are generally consistent with such a quasi-standard-energy and quasi-standard-angle jet picture. With future homogeneous burst samples (such as the one to be retrieved from the Swift mission), the refined GRB jet structure can be further constrained through a global comparison between various observed and predicted burst property distributions and relations...|$|R

This study aims to identify the mutual connections between mined out panels of a deposit and the final manifestations on the ground surface related to deep black coal mining. On {{the grounds of the}} identified connections, the study describes a method to simplify a common evaluation of undermined areas according to building site categories. Within the study, a demarcation of the areas was conducted in two localities in Czech Republic influenced by the effects of undermining in the Upper-Silesian Basin. In the allotment of the CSM Mine, an area unsuitable for founding structures was defined from the centre of the worked out workings to the distance of 175 m from the panel's edge, for which the corresponding <b>break</b> <b>angle</b> is 78. 3 °. Similarly, in the allotment of the Paskov Mine, an area unsuitable for founding structures was determined to the distance of 500 m from the panel's edge, for which the corresponding <b>break</b> <b>angle</b> is 50. 2 °.

40|$|The {{effect of}} inert gas bubbles on the tensile {{properties}} of neutron irradiated aluminium-lithium alloys was {{examined in the}} temperature range 103 to 523 °K. An analysis of the macroyield strength of alloys containing various size distributions of gas bubbles at 223 °K showed that bubbles are weak obstacles to dislocation movement with <b>breaking</b> <b>angles</b> which vary from 132 ° for 150 Å diameter bubbles to 144 ° for 50 Å bubbles.

Higher irradiation doses produced dislocation locking, possible due to the formation of jogs on glide dislocations. Ductility was severely reduced at high temperatures by the presence of inert gas bubbles in the grain boundaries.

40|$|The {{mining method}} {{used in the}} Kiirunavaara Mine induces failure in the hangingwall which caves and {{subsides}} by the effect of stress relaxation and gravity. Since the orebody is dipping towards the city of Kiruna, surface disturbances are approaching the town as mining proceeds to a greater depth. The aim of this thesis is {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the hangingwall failure process and its relationship with the ground surface subsidence. To achieve this objective two conference papers related to numerical analyses and one journal paper regarding ground surface deformation are compiled. Results from numerical analysis using continuous methods indicate that the first tension cracks are formed by extension strain on the ground surface, followed by shear failure along an almost planar failure surface between the mining level and the tension crack. The <b>break</b> <b>angle</b> calculated from the model showed good agreement with those calculated using field data. The <b>break</b> <b>angle</b> varied while the orebody width changed. A discrete element method was also used to analyze the hangingwall - caved rock - footwall interaction. The model showed that the caved rock constrains the movement of the hangingwall and footwall. Additionally, the model for the mine section Y 1500 indicated that without the backfill the footwall will fail. The time-dependent behaviour of the hangingwall was analyzed using time- displacement curves obtained from surveying stations. Three different phases were found - regressive phase, steady state, and progressive phase. The rate of movement was estimated for the first two phases. Additionally, strain analysis was carried out using subsidence data from the hangingwall. The results indicated that critical values of tensile strain can be reached before visible cracks can be found on the surface. Moreover, large geological structures concentrate the strains, creating abnormal subsidence behaviour at the hangingwall. Godkänd; 2008; 20080505 (ysko...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSeveral novel imaging {{modalities}} proposed {{during the}} last couple of years are based on a mathematical model, which uses the V-line Radon transform (VRT). This transform, sometimes called broken-ray Radon transform, integrates a function along V-shaped piecewise linear trajectories composed of two intervals in the plane with a common endpoint. Image reconstruction problems in these modalities require inversion of the VRT. While there are ample results about inversion of the regular Radon transform integrating along straight lines, very little is known for the case of the V-line Radon transform. In this paper, we derive an exact inversion formula for the VRT of functions supported in a disc of arbitrary radius. The formula uses a two-dimensional restriction of VRT data, namely the incident ray is normal to the boundary of the disc, and the <b>breaking</b> <b>angle</b> is fixed. Our method is based on the classical filtered back-projection inversion formula of the Radon transform, and has similar features in terms of stability, speed, and accuracy...|$|R

Simulated edge geometry and microhardness were found to be in reasonable agreement with published experimental results for the steel plate considered although the model was unable to simulate double cutting at 0. 8 per cent clearance.

40|$|The current mining method, {{sublevel caving}} at the Kiirunavaara iron ore mine has induced large scale {{subsidence}} to the hangingwall. The orebody dips, on average, 60 degrees eastward. Therefore the subsidence is developing {{toward the city}} of Kiiruna, the railway and other infrastructure. One {{of the most important}} factors which can affect the hangingwall subsidence is the existence of large-scale geological structures in the hangingwall. As a part of ongoing hangingwall subsidence research project, an exploration campaign was carried out to characterize the rock mass and identify the major geological structures using diamond drilling and geophysical methods. Three drill cores (koj 1 -koj 3) were obtained close to the city of Kiiruna along the mine section Y 1900. In addition, six drill cores (koj 4 -koj 9) were obtained along the railway as a part of another project related to the deformation of the ground below the railway. All of the 9 drillcores were mapped by the author in January and February 2009. Each drillcore was composed of several core runs. RQD was calculated for all the core runs, point load test was carried out on one core sample at each run, and orientation analysis was carried out on the oriented cores in the field. Later the RQD values were used to estimate the geological strength index (GSI). Finally, GSI values together with the results from point load tests were used as input data in Roclab program to estimate the rock mass strength and deformation modulus. Results indicated to a good quality of rock mass obtained from drillcores koj 1 to koj 3. Existence of possible geological structures can govern the surface deformation produced by subsidence at this region. Although the carried out core orientation analysis cannot decide the major geological structures orientation, but at least allows the exploration geologists and geophysical engineers to understand the geology of the area and make decision {{about the future of the}} site. Results obtained from mapping drillcores koj 4 through koj 9 along the railway indicated to a poor quality of rock mass in proximity of the railway. Results from this region will be used in further analysis by geologists to identify the possible weak zones at this region and their effects on the subsidence of the railway area. The 2 D distinct element method “UDEC” was used in this work to evaluate the effect of geological structures on the hangingwall subsidence. One so called “basic model” was run without any geological structures. Two different structure sets have been analyzed. One structure set had a dip in the interval 50 – 90 degrees to the east, whereas the other set had the dip 60 degrees to the east and 60 degrees to the west, respectively. The failure surface at each mining level was defined for the different models through failure indicators e. g. yielded elements in shear and tension and surface critical vertical displacement. To evaluate the effect of each orientation and structure set on the hangingwall subsidence, the <b>break</b> <b>angle</b> was calculated at each mining level. The results showed that except the structure inclined 90 degrees, the other inclinations had an obvious effect on the extension of the failure surface on the hangingwall. All models with large-scale structures showed a decrease of the <b>break</b> <b>angle</b> compared to the basic model. The structure orientations showed a tendency to govern the direction of shear and tension failure in the models. The results indicate that it is important to identify the dominating structures and their orientation and the structural geological domains. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

When an initial state is unstable, a tachyon mediated D-brane - D-brane annihilation will happen. We have described these decay processes from the world-volume gauge field theory point of view. One particular initial state was chosen {{in the form}} of two D-branes crossing at a non-zero <b>angle,</b> which <b>breaks</b> supersymmetry generically and may become unstable. In this model we had the tight control over the behavior of the theory, since one of the parameters of the explicit SUSY <b>breaking,</b> the <b>angle</b> of intersection, could have been chosen arbitrarily small. We found exact conditions in the limits chosen that define the instability for the system and found governing equations to describe the growth of the instability. Also we offered several applications of this model to the D-brane physics and conclusions about stability of configurations similar to the model described. To extend our analytical calculations to the area where no analytical solution could be found, we performed finite difference numerical simulations for several particular initial configurations. The computational results support our general conclusions about the final state and provide us with a dynamical picture of breaking D-strings...|$|R
