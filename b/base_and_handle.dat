50|$|In the 1980s, Betteridge {{undertook}} {{a new series}} of vessels composed of spherical, columnar and conical forms, fabricated in silver sheet combined with brass, copper, plexiglass and rubber. The influence of Post-Modernism can be read in the juxtaposition of these formal geometric compositions with Betteridge’s characteristic wit, and in the mixing of precious metal with non-precious materials. For example, Mad Hatter’s Tea Party, 1988, is a teapot that combines a formal, globular body with <b>base</b> <b>and</b> <b>handle</b> elements of acrylic, silver and brass sheet. The exposed connections between the individual components of the teapot display the post-modernist and constructivist influences with which Betteridge experimented during this period.|$|E

40|$|Reservoir Characterization (RC) can {{be defined}} as the act of {{building}} a reservoir model that incorporates all the characteristics of the reservoir that are pertinent to its ability to store hydrocarbons and also to produce them. It is a difficult problem due to non-linear and heterogeneous subsurface properties and associated with a number of complex tasks such as data fusion, data mining, formulation of the knowledge <b>base,</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> of the uncertainty. This present work describes the development of algorithms to obtain the functional relationships between predictor seismic attributes and target lithological properties. Seismic attributes are available over a study area with lower vertical resolution. Conversely, well logs and lithological properties are available only at specific well locations in a study area with high vertical resolution. Sand fraction, which represents per unit sand volume within the rock, has a balanced distribution between zero to unity. The thesis addresses the issues of handling the information content mismatch between predictor and target variables and proposes regularization of target property prior to building a prediction model. In this thesis, two Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based frameworks are proposed to model sand fraction from multiple seismic attributes without and with well tops information respectively. The performances of the frameworks are quantified in terms of Correlation Coefficient, Root Mean Square Error, Absolute Error Mean, etc. Comment: Supervisors: Prof. Aurobinda Routray and Prof. William K.

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} {{describes}} {{the need for}} structural analysis of different classes of RNAs and discusses RNAlishapes, a tool/algorithm which facilitates the prediction of a consensus structure of a class of RNA sequences. The algorithm uses extensions of several techniques from single sequence RNA structure prediction. The input here {{is a set of}} aligned RNA sequences, to which a shape abstraction technique is applied first. The biggest utility of the shape abstraction technique as a first step is that it retains only the nesting and adjacency pattern of helical and unpaired regions, so any exponential growth of the number of sub-optimal regions is curtailed. Structure prediction (based on an adaptive technique using a grammar describing the search space) is then performed, which accepts user defined inputs too, providing the ability to assign confidence levels to different structures. The grammar used in RNAlishapes describes RNA secondary structures without isolated <b>base</b> pairs <b>and</b> <b>handles</b> dangling <b>bases</b> differently. This branching into grammar and algebras facilitates the application of already existing grammars on individual sequences and the...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Document Management is an {{important}} component of a workflow management system. XML has become a prominent language for document processing and management, and has an additional advantage of managing persistent documents using XML document management system. In this paper, we develop an XML Document Centric Workflow Management System (XDoC-WFMS) for specifying, executing and controlling workflows. A workflow consists of a set of interrelated activities. These activities involve accessing multiple documents, each of which is encapsulated within a microagent. A micro-agent is a system agent within an XDoC-WFMS that performs document management (i. e., retrieving, concurrent updating, and transferring documents). The XDoC-WFMS supports seamless integration of document processing within a workflow, flexible and dynamic management of XML documents, micro-agent <b>based</b> event <b>and</b> exception <b>handling,</b> <b>and</b> secure document access. 1...|$|R

Classical CSP techniques are no longer sufficient, since {{the consistency of the}} constraint graph only means that the underlying plan may possibly succeed.

30|$|At present, {{there are}} many methods being used to {{determine}} breakthrough channels {{in the process of}} water flooding, such as injecting tracer material, analyzing well test data, applying fuzzy recognition of expert system based on interpretation results of logging information (Serres-Piole et al. 2012; Liu and Liang 2004; Meng et al. 2007). Some similar technologies have also been used to judge steam breakthrough performance (Closmann 1984; Masse et al. 1991). Generally, the cost of injecting tracer material is expensive and the workload is always heavy. Well test needs to measure pressure changes under the condition of well shut-in, which will influence regular production. For the fuzzy recognition of expert system, its application is always restricted due to non-screening and processing parameters in advance. Recently, Yu et al.

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} a study of Mediterranean trade 400 - 250 BC through an {{examination}} of transport amphorae from the ancient Cyrenaican city of Euesperides (Benghazi), Libya. The material comes from excavations conducted from 1999 - 2006 by the Society for Libyan Studies. Amphorae {{were used for the}} transportation of commodities such as wine and olive oil. Found in great numbers at the site they testify to the city's trading contacts in the ancient Mediterranean After an introduction to the subject of amphora studies (Chapter 1) and an historical and archaeological background (Chapter 2), the different classes and types of amphorae are presented (Chapter 3) with drawings and photographs. For certain types lists of parallels are given. Analysis of the ceramic fabrics {{is an important part of}} the method used in the study. It is emphasised that amphora morphologies must always be studied together with fabrics. The fabrics provided the key to the identification of the local or regional Cyrenaican amphorae, which are presented in detail. All the 1392 studied rims, <b>bases</b> <b>and</b> <b>handles</b> (RBH) were quantified by count in order to present the relative proportions of each type. Amphorae from selected contexts were also fully quantified, i. e. including bodysherds, in order to study potential variations between different levels of precision in the quantification. As a result, the RBH quantification was deemed reliable for a broadly dated and large set of material such as this. In Chapter 4 Mediterranean maritime trade is discussed and a number of inter-regional trade routes for the amphorae are suggested. The quantities and various provenances of the amphorae demonstrate that trade in amphora-borne commodities was undertaken over great distances and on a large scale. As much as 77 % of the amphorae are imported, 5 % from the Punic world and the remaining 72 % from various parts of ancient Greece. The remaining 23 % of the amphorae are Cyrenaican. The amphorae from Euesperides contribute significantly to altering our views on the extent and organisation of maritime trade for the period studied. Trade was not regionally-bounded; instead commodities were traded over long distances and along many parallel, inter-regional trade routes. Euesperides was a node in this system of inter-locking Mediterranean markets. The thesis thus demonstrates how a study of quantified amphorae can give a much fuller and richer understanding of trading contacts than traditional approaches focusing on stamped amphora handles. The results obtained provide a set of data from Euesperides which can be used as a point of reference and departure for other studies...|$|R
