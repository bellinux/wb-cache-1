25|$|Compounds {{are added}} to mass {{finishing}} processes to assist in deburring, <b>burnishing,</b> cutting, cleaning, descaling, and inhibiting corrosion. They may be liquids or dry powders. They are usually broken up into four types: deburring and finishing, <b>burnishing,</b> cleaning, and water stabilizing.|$|E

25|$|San Bartolo Coyotepec is {{the home}} of barro negro (black clay) pottery, the most {{recognized}} type from the state. Barro negro is a non glazed pottery, which gets its shine from <b>burnishing,</b> rubbing the dried piece before firing. It is almost exclusively made in the Coyotepec area. These pieces are also decorative and include lamps, large jar called cantaros, bells, masks, wall decorations and more. To encourage visitors, the town hosts the Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca museum and has a Mercado de Artesanias.|$|E

25|$|Terra sigillata {{is usually}} brushed or sprayed in thin layers onto dry or almost dry unfired ware. The ware is then quickly <b>burnished</b> {{with a soft}} cloth before {{the water in the}} terra sigillata soaks into the porous body. The <b>burnished</b> ware is allowed to dry again to remove the added {{moisture}} and biscuit fired, often fired to a lower than normal bisque temperature of approximately 900°C. Higher firing temperatures tend to remove the <b>burnished</b> effect in the clay surface.|$|R
25|$|Barrel <b>burnishing</b> {{is a type}} of {{barreling}} {{where no}} cutting action is desired. The goal is to reduce minute irregularities and produce a clean, smooth surface. The parts are usually tumbled against themselves or with steel balls, shot, rounded-end pins, or ballcones to achieve this. It is also usually a wet process that uses water and a lubricant or cleaning agent, such as soap or cream of tartar. The barrel is not loaded more than half full and if media is used then a 2:1 ratio of media to parts is maintained to keep the parts from rubbing.|$|E
500|$|For some {{circular}} broaches, <b>burnishing</b> {{teeth are}} provided instead of finishing teeth. They {{are not really}} teeth, as they are just rounded discs that are [...] oversized. This results in <b>burnishing</b> the hole to the proper size. This is primarily used on non-ferrous and cast iron workpieces.|$|E
500|$|Prints {{were made}} with blocks face up so the printer could vary {{pressure}} for different effects, and watch as paper absorbed the water-based sumi ink, applied quickly in even horizontal strokes. [...] Amongst the printer's tricks were embossing of the image, achieved by pressing an uninked woodblock on the paper to achieve effects, such as the textures of clothing patterns or fishing net. [...] Other effects included <b>burnishing</b> by rubbing with agate to brighten colours; varnishing; overprinting; dusting with metal or mica; and sprays to imitate falling snow.|$|E

500|$|Ceramics are {{the most}} {{commonly}} surviving type of Maya art. The Maya {{had no knowledge of}} the potter's wheel, and Maya vessels were built up by coiling rolled strips of clay into the desired form. Maya pottery was not glazed, although it often had a fine finish produced by <b>burnishing.</b> Maya ceramics were painted with clay slips blended with minerals and coloured clays. Ancient Maya firing techniques have yet to be replicated. A quantity of extremely fine ceramic figurines have been excavated from Late Classic tombs on Jaina Island, in northern Yucatán. They stand from [...] high and were hand modelled, with exquisite detail. The Ik-style polychrome ceramic corpus, including finely painted plates and cylindrical vessels, originated in Late Classic Motul de San José. It includes a set of features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks. One of the most distinctive features is the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life. The subject matter of the vessels includes courtly life from the Petén region in the 8th century AD, such as diplomatic meetings, feasting, bloodletting, scenes of warriors and the sacrifice of prisoners of war.|$|E
2500|$|Synthetic random-shaped media: The {{most popular}} {{synthetic}} random media is fused aluminum oxide, {{which is available}} {{in a number of}} grades. [...] The more loosely bound, coarse-grained materials are characterized by fast cut and high depreciation rates. [...] Because of the dark color of fused aluminum oxide, the soil generated by this material is excessive in many applications. [...] Fine-grained fused aluminum oxide is generally employed for <b>burnishing</b> and in this respect is unexcelled in many applications {{with the possible exception of}} steel. [...] Where some light cutting is required, fine-grained aluminum oxide can develop a better luster on stainless steels and other hard surfaces than can be achieved with steel <b>burnishing</b> media.|$|E

50|$|Black-burnished ware {{is a type}} of Romano-British ceramic. The {{classification}} {{includes two}} entirely different pottery types which share many stylistic characteristics. Black <b>burnished</b> ware 1 (BB1), is a black, coarse and gritty fabric. Vessels are hand made. Black <b>burnished</b> ware 2 (BB2) is a finer, grey-coloured, wheel thrown fabric.|$|R
25|$|Two gilding {{techniques}} were applied on the carved ornaments of the icon screen: <b>burnished</b> and matte gilding. Both methods contain about 18–60% dissolved gold. In the <b>burnished</b> technique {{the surface is}} polished, after the gilding is dry. This method results a glossier, more emphasized surface. Among others the stems of the plants, the veins of the leaves, the flower heads and the plane surfaces of the icon frames were gilt with <b>burnished</b> gilding. Matte gilding was applied for {{the surface of the}} leaves and generally the deeper parts of the carved ornaments.|$|R

2500|$|Part separation: A very {{important}} {{function of the}} medium is to separate parts during the deburring, cutting, surface improving or <b>burnishing</b> operations. [...] The media:parts volume ratio is normally used to control the amount of part-on-part contact which will occur in a vibratory or tumble finishing operation. [...] At low ratios, considerable part-on-part contact occurs, while at higher ratios part-on-part contact is limited.|$|E
2500|$|Modern [...] "Terra sig" [...] {{should be}} clearly {{distinguished}} from the close reproductions of Roman wares made by some potters deliberately recreating and using the Roman methods. [...] The finish called 'terra sigillata' by studio potters {{can be made from}} most clay, mixed as a very thin liquid slip and settled to separate out only the finest particles to be used as terra sigillata. When applied to unfired clay surfaces, [...] "terra sig" [...] can be polished with a soft cloth or brush to achieve a shine ranging from a smooth silky lustre to a high gloss. The surface of ancient terra sigillata vessels did not require this <b>burnishing</b> or polishing. <b>Burnishing</b> was a technique used on some wares in the Roman period, but terra sigillata was not one of them. [...] The polished surface can only be retained if fired within the low-fire range and will lose its shine if fired higher, but can still display an appealing silky quality.|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{and performance}} of the solid film lubricant used in {{a majority of the}} surety devices in the enduring stockpile have been investigated. Oxidation of this lubricant in air at 150 C produces {{a significant increase in the}} molybdenum oxide to sulfide ratio, indicative of degradation of the primary lubricating constituent of the composite lubricant. Oxidation is more extensive on samples that were <b>burnished</b> such that the substrate is exposed over a fraction of the surface, relative to those which were only lightly <b>burnished.</b> Friction results indicate that oxidation in air did not increase the initial or steady-state friction coefficient for lightly <b>burnished</b> surfaces. However, surfaces <b>burnished</b> to expose substrate material experienced a significant increase in both initial and steady-state friction. Oxidation of lubricated parts retrieved from aged stronglinks has also been demonstrated...|$|R

2500|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the archaeological usage, in which the term terra sigillata refers to a whole class of pottery, in contemporary ceramic art, 'terra sigillata' describes only a [...] watery refined slip used to facilitate the <b>burnishing</b> of raw clay surfaces and used to promote carbon smoke effects, in both primitive low temperature firing techniques and unglazed alternative western-style Raku firing techniques. Terra sigillata is also used as a brushable decorative colourant medium in higher temperature glazed ceramic techniques.|$|E

2500|$|Steel: Case hardened, {{stress-relieved}} steel preformed shapes {{are available}} {{in a variety of}} sizes and configurations. [...] Balls, balls with flat spots, ovoids (footballs), diagonally cut wire similar to angle-cut cylinders, ball cones and cones (both of which are different from the general concept of cones) and pins are the most commonly used. [...] Steel media weigh approximately 300 pounds per cubic foot and are expensive for initial installation, but, because of their minimal attrition rate and extreme cleanliness, are being more widely used for light deburring applications and cleaning. [...] Compounds are available to keep steel <b>burnishing</b> media clean and bright for extended periods.|$|E
2500|$|Arretine ware, {{in spite}} of its very {{distinctive}} appearance, {{was an integral part of}} the wider picture of fine ceramic tablewares in the Graeco-Roman world of the Hellenistic and early Roman period. [...] That picture must itself be seen in relation to the luxury tablewares made of silver. [...] Centuries before Italian [...] terra sigillata was made, Attic painted vases, and later their regional variants made in Italy, involved the preparation of a very fine clay body covered with a slip that fired to a glossy surface without the need for any polishing or <b>burnishing.</b> [...] Greek painted wares also involved the precise understanding and control of firing conditions to achieve the contrasts of black and red.|$|E
