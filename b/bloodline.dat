2500|$|<b>Bloodlines</b> {{are often}} considered, as some <b>bloodlines</b> {{are known to}} cross well with others. [...] If the parents have not yet proven {{themselves}} by competition or by producing quality offspring, the <b>bloodlines</b> of the horse are often a good indicator of quality and possible strengths and weaknesses. Some <b>bloodlines</b> are known not only for their athletic ability, but could also carry a conformational or genetic defect, poor temperament, or for a medical problem. Some <b>bloodlines</b> are also fashionable or otherwise marketable, which is an important consideration should the mare owner wish to sell the foal.|$|R

5|$|Although {{credited}} {{with the development of}} the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard beagle <b>bloodline.</b>|$|E
5|$|Billy, a Kashmir goat, is {{descended from}} the same royal <b>bloodline</b> as the {{original}} herd, but was not selected from the wild population; {{he was born in}} Whipsnade Zoo.

The tradition is not new: since 1844, the British monarchy has presented an unbroken series of Kashmir goats to the Royal Welch Fusiliers from the Crown's own royal herd.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bloodlines,</b> on {{the other}} hand, either cannot trace their lineage to an Antediluvian founder or are too little in number to be {{considered}} {{a major player in the}} Jyhad.

5|$|At {{some time}} during the 590s, Rædwald married a woman whose name is unknown, though it is known from Bede that she was pagan. By her he fathered at least two sons, Rægenhere and Eorpwald. He also had an older son, Sigeberht, whose name is unlike other Wuffingas names but which {{is typical of the}} East Saxon dynasty. It has been {{suggested}} that Rædwald's queen had previously been married to a member of the Essex royal family and that Sigeberht was Rædwald's stepson, as was stated by William of Malmesbury in the 12th century. Sigeberht earned the enmity of his step-father, who drove him into exile in Gaul, possibly to protect the Wuffingas <b>bloodline.</b>|$|E
5|$|Colts are {{assessed}} in their two-year-old {{year by the}} New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society for suitability to be kept as stallions; any animal failing the assessment must be gelded. Once approved, every spring (usually in March), the stallions must pass the Verderers' assessment before they are permitted onto the Forest to breed. The stallion scheme resulted in a reduction of genetic diversity in the ponies running out on the New Forest, and to counteract this and preserve the hardiness of Forest-run ponies, the Verderers introduced the <b>Bloodline</b> Diversity Project, which will use hardy Forest-run mares, mostly over eleven years old, bred to stallions {{that have not been}} run out on the Forest, or closely related to those that have.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, the United States Department of the Interior {{created the}} Southwestern Range and Sheep Breeding Laboratory {{to address the}} {{problems}} Rambouillet stock had caused for the Navajo economy. Located at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, the program's aim was to develop a new sheep <b>bloodline</b> that simulated the wool characteristics of the 19th-century Navajo-Churro stock and would also supply adequate meat. The Fort Wingate researchers collected old Navajo-Churro stock from remote parts of the reservation and hired a weaver to test their experimental wool. Offspring of these experiments were distributed among the Navajo people. World War II interrupted the greater part of this effort when military work resumed at Fort Wingate.|$|E
5|$|In {{political}} and sociocultural studies, monarchies are normally associated with hereditary rule; most monarchs, in both {{historical and contemporary}} contexts, have been born and raised within a royal family. Succession has been defined {{using a variety of}} distinct formulae, such as proximity of blood, primogeniture, and agnatic seniority. Some monarchies, however, are not hereditary, and the ruler is instead determined through an elective process; a modern example is the throne of Malaysia. These systems defy the model concept of a monarchy, but are commonly considered as such because they retain certain associative characteristics. Many systems use a combination of hereditary and elective elements, where the election or nomination of a successor is restricted to members of a royal <b>bloodline.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{steamship}} Killarney {{arrived in}} Bangkok on April 26. How {{they would be}} received was speculative, since Hawaii had no treaty with Siam. Upon arrival, they were carried aboard a royal yacht up the Menam River to Bangkok. From there, they were carried on silk chairs {{to one of the}} many palaces in Bangkok for the duration of their visit. The following day they met with King Chulalongkorn who told Kalākaua that the Siamese and Native Hawaiians were related by the common Malayan <b>bloodline.</b> A member of the Siamese royal family escorted Kalākaua to see the nation's famed white elephants.|$|E

5|$|The third story follows Daenerys Targaryen, {{daughter}} of Aerys, the last Targaryen king. On {{the continent of}} Essos, east of Westeros across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys is married off by her elder brother Viserys Targaryen to a powerful warlord, but slowly becomes an independent and intelligent ruler in her own right. Her rise to power is aided by the historic birth of three dragons, hatched from eggs given to her as wedding gifts. The three dragons soon become not only a symbol of her <b>bloodline</b> and her legitimate claim to the throne, but also devastating weapons of war.|$|E
5|$|Today, eight stallions are {{recognized}} as the foundation bloodstock of the breed, all foaled the late 18th and early 19th centuries. All modern Lipizzans trace their bloodlines to these eight stallions, and all breeding stallions have included in their name {{the name of the}} foundation sire of their <b>bloodline.</b> There are also classic mare lines, with up to 35 recognized by various breed registries. The majority of horses are registered through the member organizations of the Lipizzan International Federation, which covers almost 11,000 horses in 19 countries and at 9 state studs in Europe. The majority of Lipizzans reside in Europe, with smaller numbers in the Americas, Africa and Australia. Generally gray in color, the Lipizzan is a muscular breed that matures slowly and is long-lived.|$|E

5|$|Although Littleprincessemma, American Pharoah's dam, is the {{half-sister}} to graded stakes winner Storm Wolf, and to Misty Rosette, {{winner of}} the Old Hat Stakes in 2006, her own undistinguished racing career, combined with the modest record of her sire, Yankee Gentleman, dampened initial public expectations for her second-born foal. Yet American Pharoah's maternal <b>bloodline</b> includes Storm Cat, a Grade I winner retired early due to injury, Northern Dancer, a Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, and Terlingua, a celebrated broodmare, through whom he is a fifth-generation descendant of Secretariat. He is also descended through his dam from Flying Paster, a Grade I champion who was 1978 California Horse of the Year, and Exclusive Native (sire of Affirmed and Genuine Risk). Through both sire and dam, American Pharoah is a fifth- and sixth-generation descendant of Bold Ruler, {{as well as a}} sixth- and seventh-generation descendant of Tom Fool, one of the top thoroughbreds of the last century. His tail-female line traces back to The Oldfield Mare, foaled circa 1695.|$|E
5|$|Beagles {{were in the}} United States by the 1840s at the latest, but {{the first}} dogs were {{imported}} strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged Dachshunds with weak heads has {{little resemblance to the}} standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality <b>bloodline</b> began in the early 1870s when General Richard Rowett from Illinois imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887. The beagle was accepted as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885. In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Colón {{was born}} in the Santurce {{district}} of the capital of Puerto Rico, San Juan. He is son of retired wrestler and promoter Carlos Colón, Sr. and his wife, Nancy.

A second sister, Melissa did not enter the wrestling business. Other members of Colón's family have also been involved in the World Wrestling Council; his uncle José Colón and cousin Orlando Colón have been involved in several angles within the company. On April 18, 2009, Colón was retroactively granted the Canadian citizenship following a series of amends to the Canadian nationality law. This revision automatically granted the distinction to all the first generation individuals born abroad. The revision only required a single Canadian parent, a demand that Colón met through his maternal <b>bloodline.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Retrospective critiques {{continue}} {{to praise the}} game's narrative and degree of choice.

Oh right, because it's so {{very hard to do}} ... the lack of games comparable to <b>Bloodlines</b> {{is one of the great}} tragedies of our time." [...] Eurogamer called the game inspirational, with an unmatched level of narrative detail. In 2010, The Escapist called <b>Bloodlines</b> a flawed masterpiece which could have been a genuine masterpiece with more time, money and staff; although great games may inspire awe, it instead created a devoted fan base which continued to develop the game. <b>Bloodlines</b> is considered a cult classic.|$|R
