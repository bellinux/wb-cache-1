The group was successful in taking down local and global Scientology websites intermittently from January 18, 2008 until at least January 25, 2008.

This resulted in {{a large amount of}} coverage on social <b>bookmarking</b> websites.|$|E

25|$|Bookmarks {{have been}} {{incorporated}} in browsers since the Mosaic browser in 1993.

25|$|Recent {{research}} {{using data from}} the social <b>bookmarking</b> website Delicious, has shown that collaborative tagging systems exhibit a form of complex systems (or self-organizing) dynamics. Although there is no central controlled vocabulary to constrain the actions of individual users, the distributions of tags that describe different resources has been shown to converge over time to a stable power law distributions. Once such stable distributions form, examining the correlations between different tags can be used to construct simple folksonomy graphs, which can be efficiently partitioned to obtained a form of community or shared vocabularies. Such vocabularies {{can be seen as a}} form of collective intelligence, emerging from the decentralised actions of a community of users. The Wall-it Project is also an example of social <b>bookmarking.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{example of}} emergence in web-based systems is social <b>bookmarking</b> (also called collaborative tagging). In social <b>bookmarking</b> systems, users assign tags to resources shared with other users, which {{gives rise to}} a type of information organisation that emerges from this crowdsourcing process. Recent research which analyzes empirically the complex dynamics of such systems has shown that consensus on stable distributions and a simple form of shared vocabularies does indeed emerge, {{even in the absence of}} a central controlled vocabulary. Some believe that this could be because users who contribute tags all use the same language, and they share similar semantic structures underlying the choice of words. The convergence in social tags may therefore be interpreted as the emergence of structures as people who have similar semantic interpretation collaboratively index online information, a process called semantic imitation.|$|E

25|$|In {{the context}} of the World Wide Web, a {{bookmark}} is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is stored for later retrieval in any of various storage formats. All modern web browsers include bookmark features. Bookmarks are called favorites or Internet shortcuts in Internet Explorer, and by virtue of that browser's large market share, these terms have been synonymous with bookmark since the first browser war. Bookmarks are normally accessed through a menu in the user's web browser, and folders are commonly used for organization. In addition to <b>bookmarking</b> methods within most browsers, many external applications offer bookmark management.|$|E

2500|$|Metaphase: The {{metaphase}} {{structure of}} chromatin differs vastly {{to that of}} interphase. It is optimised for physical strength and manageability, forming the classic chromosome structure seen in karyotypes. The structure of the condensed chromatin {{is thought to be}} loops of 30nm fibre to a central scaffold of proteins. It is, however, not well-characterised.The physical strength of chromatin is vital for this stage of division to prevent shear damage to the DNA as the daughter chromosomes are separated. To maximise strength the composition of the chromatin changes as it approaches the centromere, primarily through alternative histone H1 analogues.It should also be noted that, during mitosis, while most of the chromatin is tightly compacted, there are small regions that are not as tightly compacted. These regions often correspond to promoter regions of genes that were active in that cell type prior to entry into chromatosis. The lack of compaction of these regions is called <b>bookmarking,</b> which is an epigenetic mechanism believed to be important for transmitting to daughter cells the [...] "memory" [...] of which genes were active prior to entry into mitosis. This <b>bookmarking</b> mechanism is needed to help transmit this memory because transcription ceases during mitosis.|$|E

[...] Due to the large user bases of these websites, any link from one of them to another, the smaller website may in a flash crowd, a sudden surge of interest in the target website. In addition to user-generated promotion, these sites also offer advertisements within individual user communities and categories. [...] Because ads can be placed in designated communities with a very specific target audience and demographic, they have far greater potential for traffic generation than ads selected simply through cookie and browser history. [...] Additionally, some of these websites have also implemented measures to make ads more relevant to users by allowing users to vote on which ones will be shown on pages they frequent. [...] The ability to redirect large volumes of web traffic and target specific, relevant audiences makes social <b>bookmarking</b> sites a valuable asset for social media marketers.|$|E

This thesis presents Smart <b>Bookmarks,</b> a web automation system that allows users to automate complex tasks or easily return to otherwise hard-to-reach dynamic web pages by creating smart <b>bookmarks.</b> A smart <b>bookmark</b> consists of an automatically generated script of recorded browsing commands that returns to a particular web page or web application state. Smart <b>bookmarks</b> can be created retroactively, meaning that the user does not need to explicitly initiate recording before performing a task, but can instead request a <b>bookmark</b> after visiting the destination page; the appropriate sequence of commands need to return to a page is selected automatically from a history of the user's browsing interactions. Smart <b>Bookmarks</b> provides a rich, visual representation of recorded <b>bookmarks</b> in order to clearly illustrate the actions that a <b>bookmark</b> performs, and includes textual descriptions, screenshots, and animated previews of each command. Finally, the system allows users to easily and intuitively edit <b>bookmarks</b> after they have been created, and to share smart <b>bookmarks</b> with other users. by Darris Hupp. Thesis (M. Eng.)

These sites may have an [...] "architecture of participation" [...] that encourages users to add value to the application as they use it. Users can add value in many ways, such as by commenting on a news story on a news website, by uploading a relevant photo on a travel website, or by adding a link to a video or TED talk which is pertinent to the subject being discussed on a website. Some scholars argue that cloud computing is an example of Web 2.0 because cloud computing is simply an implication of computing on the Internet.|$|E
