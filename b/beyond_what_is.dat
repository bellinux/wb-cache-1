5|$|Partly {{because of}} {{theoretical}} and mathematical difficulties {{and partly because}} of the extremely high energies (<b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> technologically possible for the foreseeable future) needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point to any of these models being a correct fundamental description of nature. This has led some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on these problems.|$|E
5|$|As global {{population}} and affluence has increased, {{so has the}} use of various materials increased in volume, diversity and distance transported. Included here are raw materials, minerals, synthetic chemicals (including hazardous substances), manufactured products, food, living organisms and waste. By 2050, humanity could consume an estimated 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year (three times its current amount) unless the economic growth rate is decoupled from the rate of natural resource consumption. Developed countries' citizens consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita, ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries with resource consumption levels far <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> likely sustainable.|$|E

25|$|Strict {{discipline}} {{can have}} the opposite effect: brats may rebel or behave in adolescent manners well <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> normally considered acceptable. Others develop psychological problems due to the intense stress of always being on their best behavior.|$|E
25|$|Utilities {{also pay}} a {{wastewater}} discharge fee which {{depends on the}} degree of pollution of the discharged treated wastewater. The discharge fee is supposed to provide an incentive to treat water <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> legally required (Abwasserabgabengesetz). It accounts for about 3 percent of total sanitation costs.|$|E
50|$|Alive and striving <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> only current circumstances, {{moments that}} pass {{and do not}} remain, Unamuno was hoping to create himself, or at least create his {{personal}} myth, and to <b>be</b> forever <b>what</b> <b>was</b> passing.|$|R

25|$|When an {{assessment}} is {{used with the}} purpose of predicting an outcome (perhaps another test score or some other behavioral measure), a new instrument must show that it is able to increase our knowledge or prediction of the outcome variable <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> already known based on existing instruments.|$|E
25|$|Another {{mechanism}} {{involves a}} change in the hair cycle. There are three stages of the hair cycle: the anagen phase (hair growth), the catagen phase (hair follicle death), and the telogen phase (hair shedding). If the anagen phase increases <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> normal; that region of the body will experience excessive hair growth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now {{the picnic}} site {{there was once}} an engine shed (a former transit shed), used to house the {{locomotive}} used between here and the mainline junction. Opposite the old signal post was once a large water tank, used to fill the tenders which were then taken up the incline.|$|E

30|$|According to Charles Peirce, {{new ideas}} cannot be {{originated}} by deduction or induction {{but only by}} abduction; “[a] bduction furnishes all our ideas concerning real things, <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> given in perception” (www.commens.org/dictionary/sources/quotes/ 644).|$|R

25|$|The {{high demand}} for {{low-cost}} sequencing has driven {{the development of}} high-throughput sequencing technologies that parallelize the sequencing process, producing thousands or millions of sequences at once. High-throughput sequencing is intended to {{lower the cost of}} DNA sequencing <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> possible with standard dye-terminator methods. In ultra-high-throughput sequencing, as many as 500,000 sequencing-by-synthesis operations may be run in parallel.|$|E

In such a phase, natural evolution would be replaced with deliberate participatory or directed evolution.|$|E
25|$|In 1770 William Willoughby {{took over}} Highbury Barn and greatly {{increased}} its popularity. He expanded {{its size and}} facilities, taking over land and buildings from the farm next door, reaching <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now Kelvin Road and created a bowling green, trap-ball grounds and gardens. It could cater for company dinners of 2,000 people, concerts and dancing {{and became one of}} the most popular venues in London.|$|E
25|$|With its mix of {{right-of-way}} {{types and}} train control technologies, LRT offers {{the widest range}} of latitude of any rail system in the design, engineering, and operating practices.

25|$|Journalists responded skeptically to McCloud's {{idea of the}} {{infinite}} canvas, as five years after Reinventing Comics, the concept had not taken off in large proportions yet.

25|$|According to Rand, {{attaining}} knowledge <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> {{given in}} perception requires both volition (or {{the exercise of}} free will) and adherence to a specific method of validation through observation, concept-formation, {{and the application of}} inductive and deductive reasoning. For example, a belief in dragons, however sincere, does not mean reality contains any dragons. A process of proof identifying the basis in reality of a claimed item of knowledge is necessary to establish its truth.|$|E
25|$|Scriptures are {{understood}} to contain historical fact, poetry, idiom, metaphor, simile, moral fable, parable, prophecy and wisdom literature, and each bears its own consideration in its interpretation.

In biblical interpretation, it does not use speculations, suggestive theories, or incomplete indications, not going <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> fully known.|$|E
