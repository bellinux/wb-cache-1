Based on these results, the short circuit capability of the <b>BiFET</b> is discussed.

40|$|In this work, the {{feasibility}} of the Bipolar-Injection Field Effect-Transistor (<b>BIFET)</b> [5] in two different Dual Thyristor type circuits [4] for an application as solid-state circuit breaker (SSCB) is experimentally verified. The Dual Thyristor type circuits are assembled from discrete silicon JFETs and a silicon carbide <b>BIFET</b> and are electrically characterized at various temperatures. The current-voltage characteristic shows the expected regenerative self-triggered turn-off capability under over-currents and the option to control the turn-off current by a passive resistor network. The issue with the adverse positive temperature coefficient of the trigger-current can be solved by putting the SiC <b>BIFET</b> in a cascode arrangement with a silicon Dual Thyristor. In this configuration the SiC <b>BIFET</b> provides the high voltage blocking capability and the silicon Dual Thyristor with its negative temperature coefficient controls the trigger-current. Transient analyses of both circuits indicate fast switching times of less than 50 μs seconds. It is demonstrated for the first time, that the SiC <b>BIFET,</b> due to its normally-on behaviour, used in a Dual Thyristor type circuit is a promising concept for self-triggered fuses in high current and high voltage applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — With the {{increasingly}} demanding for PLL synthesizer very fast locking in base-station applications [1], {{we have developed}} a fractional-N sigma-delta synthesizer to validate the newly proposed Bipolar-MOSFET Charge-Pump (<b>BiFET</b> CP). The <b>BiFET</b> CP has been designed by using vertical PNP bipolar devices Jazz’s SiGe 60 BiCMOS offered to replace the conventional PFETs in current steering charge pumps. The CP presents three features of small die size, low power consumption, and source-sink current well-matching, which quite fits the CP array design in the synthesizer very fast locking application. The in-band phase noise mainly depending on the CP is tested with ~- 105 dBc/Hz through whole frequency band (806 ~ 853 MHz). The synthesizer with VCO integrated in a single-chip has been also fabricated and tested. The phase noise achieved is about- 145 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset.

The vertical integration of the InGaP HBT and the pHEMT on the same 6 inch GaAs epitaxial wafer allows independent optimization of each device for a given application. This is possible since the only shared epitaxial layer among those of the HBT and pHEMT structure is a heavily n-doped layer located between the HBT and the FET structure.

40|$|This <b>BiFET</b> {{technology}} integrates a JFET device, {{also called}} a voltage-variable resistor (VVR) device, into the emitter layer structure of an InGaP/GaAs HBT. This new VVR device enables new PA bias circuit designs with lower or no voltage reference. This technology only requires one additional mask, one additional etch, and 2 additional epi layers {{as compared to}} an HBT-only process. These minimal changes add minimal cost to this <b>BiFET</b> process. The HBT device showed no appreciable performance trade-offs with the additional epi layers. Since the p-n heterojunction controls the drain current rather than a gate metal, manufacturing this device requires tight control of the InGaP emitter, GaAs channel, and InGaP etch stop layers.

The key to this separation is the realization that material and gate etch variation move the Idss (zero bias drain current) and threshold voltage (Vp) along a line determined by Idss vs. Vp 2 while feature size variations break this correlation and move the Idss/Vp perpendicular to this line. This method of separation should also be applicable to understanding HEMT devices that use a power-recess...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} motive of moduli spaces of stable vector bundles over a smooth {{projective}} curve.

Introduction The cohomology of the moduli spaces of stable vector bundles over a smooth projective curve has been thoroughly studied over the last years. This study has been accomplished by topological methods involving the Narasimhan-Seshadri correspondence ([34]), by number theoretical methods ([22], [23]) and using differential geometry ([1]).

40|$|This {{tutorial}} discusses {{two related}} topics related to op amps: output phase reversal, and input over-voltage protection. Output voltage phase-reversal {{is a problem}} that occurs in some op amps when the input common-mode (CM) voltage is exceeded. It is usually caused when one of the internal stages of the op amp no longer has sufficient bias voltage across it and subsequently turns off. This causes the output voltage to swing to the opposite rail until the input comes back within the commonmode range, as shown in Figure 1 for a voltage follower. Note that the inputs may still be well within the supply voltage rails, but simply above or below one of the specified CM limits. Typically, this is towards the negative range, and phase-reversal is most often associated with JFET and/or <b>BiFET</b> amplifiers, but some bipolar single-supply amplifiers are also susceptible to it. Figure 1 : Output Voltage Phase-Reversal in a Voltage Follower Although phase-reversal is usually a temporary condition, it can be disastrous if the op amp is within a servo loop. Phase-reversal is most likely to occur when the op amp is configured as a unity-gain voltag...|$|E
30|$|An {{important}} source of information presently is social media, which reports any major event including natural disasters. Social media also includes conversational data. As a result, the volume of data on social media has an enormous increase. During the time of natural disaster like floods, tsunami, earthquake, landslide, etc., people require information in those situations, so that relief operations like help, medical facilities can save many lives (<b>Bifet</b> et al. in J Mach Learn Res Proc Track 17 : 5 – 11, 2011). An attempt is made in this article on Geoparsing which will identify the places of disaster on a Map. Geoparsing {{is a process of}} converting free text description of locations into the geographical identifier in an unambiguous manner with the help of longitude and latitude. With the help of geographical coordinates, it can be mapped and entered into geographical information system. A real-time, reliable at robust twitter messages which are the source of the information can handle a large amount of data. After collecting tweets at the real time we can parse them for the disaster situation and its location. This information will help to identify the exact location of the event. For knowing information on the natural disaster, tweets are extracted from twitter to R-Studio environment. First the extracted tweets from twitter are parsed using R about “Natural Disaster”. Later we parsed the tweets and store in CSV format in R database. For all posted data tweets are calculated and stored in a file. Later visual analysis is performed for the data store using R Statistical Software. Further, it is useful to assess the severity of the natural disaster. Sentiment analysis (Rahmath in IJAIEM 3 (5): 1 – 3, 2014) of user tweets is useful for decision making (Rao et al. in Int J Comput Sci Inf Technol 6 (3): 2923 – 7, 2015).|$|E

40|$|Millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) {{wireless}} communication systems often employ phased array architecture {{to overcome the}} high path loss and to provide spatial selectivity. As the number of elements in the array increases, the complexity {{as well as physical}} area required for the circuitry also increase. This calls for circuit blocks that are multifunctional and can be electronically reconfigured. This dissertation presents the analyses, designs and implementations of electronically reconfigurable circuit blocks that operate bidirectionally and at multiple frequency bands. The first part of the dissertation discusses three mm-Wave reconfigurable circuit blocks realized using the constructive wave amplification technique (CCWA) in both SiGe BiCMOS and CMOS SOI processes. First, a power amplifier is designed at 60 GHz in a 0. 12 -μm SiGe BiCMOS process that incorporates a CMOS-bipolar cascode (<b>BiFET)</b> feedback circuit topology. Second, a dual Q- and W- band, bidirectional amplifier is demonstrated in a 45 -nm CMOS SOI process where operations at different bands and directions are realized by electronically config- uring the feedback “field of FETs”. The bidirectional concept is then extended to the design of a three-port V-band reconfigurable active circulator that directs traveling waves between different pairs of ports while providing isolation from the remaining ports. Secondly, a switchless bidirectional front-end architecture is demonstrated in a 90 -nm SiGe BiCMOS process. The proposed architecture enables a time-division duplexed (TDD) operation without the use of high-speed transmit and receive (T/R) switch. A passive transmission line matching network is used to isolate the power amplifier and low-noise amplifier and a bidirectional passive mixer is used for up- and down-conversion of the signal. The front-end is incorporated to a two-element linear coupled oscillator array to form a local oscillator beamforming transceiver. Finally, a high-speed track-and-hold amplifier (THA) is demonstrated in a 90 -nm SiGe BiCMOS process. This work demonstrates the competitiveness of advance integrated silicon processes when being benchmarked against high performance III-V processes. The continuous improvement of silicon-based transistors will allow integrated systems to operate at higher frequencies. All the circuits techniques present in this dissertation are applicable to the design at mm-Wave and beyond...|$|E
