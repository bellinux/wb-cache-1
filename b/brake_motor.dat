50|$|Motors of {{this type}} {{can also be found}} on {{overhead}} cranes and hoists. The micro speed unit combines two motors and an intermediate gear reducer. These are used for applications where extreme mechanical positioning accuracy and high cycling capability are needed. The micro speed unit combines a “main” conical rotor <b>brake</b> <b>motor</b> for rapid speed and a “micro” conical rotor <b>brake</b> <b>motor</b> for slow or positioning speed. The intermediate gearbox allows a range of ratios, and motors of different speeds can be combined to produce high ratios between high and low speed.|$|E

50|$|A conical rotor <b>brake</b> <b>motor</b> {{incorporates}} the brake {{as an integral}} part of the conical sliding rotor. When the motor is at rest, a spring acts on the sliding rotor and forces the brake ring against the brake cap in the motor, holding the rotor stationary. When the motor is energized, its magnetic field generates both an axial and a radial component. The axial component overcomes the spring force, releasing the brake; while the radial component causes the rotor to turn. There is no additional brake control required.|$|E

Kenseth held a 2.2-second lead over Stewart, who moved up to second and was closing on Kenseth by lap 265.

Johnson led the field on the lap-272 restart, followed by Kenseth and Stewart. Kenseth passed Johnson to reclaim the first position four laps later. Vickers and Rudd made contact while leaving the fourth turn on lap 281 but no caution was needed. Johnson retook the lead from Kenseth two laps later. Mayfield spun 360 degrees on the front stretch and went into the infield grass after trying to avoid a slower car on his outside on lap 291, causing the eleventh caution. The leaders, including Johnson, made pit stops for tires under caution. Rudd took over the lead for one lap before pitting on lap 293. Johnson regained the lead after the pit stops, maintaining it at the lap-297 restart; he was followed by Kenseth and Earnhardt. Kyle Busch rejoined the race on the same lap.

40|$|This {{project work}} {{focused on the}} design and testing of gearbox for fault detection. Gearboxes are very {{important}} things in many industries applications. Thus the interest for their health monitoring is growing and effective diagnostic techniques and methodologies are the objective of previous studies. Here {{we are going to}} detect different types of fault which occurs in gearbox. There are mainly three types of fault occurs. These faults are slightly worn, medium worn, broken teeth. With the help of vibration study (due to gears fault) through oscilloscope we can design such kind of system which can detect what kind of fault a gearbox has. A multistage faulty gearbox is used in the present study. The test setup comprises of a multistage gearbox, driven by an induction motor and loaded by a generator or by a <b>brake</b> <b>motor.</b> The gearbox is an automotive transmission gearbox with five gears including back gear, such as 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th and back gears, under synchrony-meshed condition.

40|$|SIM PlanetQuest will {{exploit the}} {{classical}} measuring tool of astrometry (interferometry) with unprecedented precision to make dramatic advances {{in many areas}} of astronomy and astrophysics'(1). In order to obtain interferometric data two large steerable mirrors, or Siderostats, are used to direct starlight into the interferometer. A gimbaled mechanism actuated by linear actuators is chosen to meet the unprecedented pointing and angle tracking requirements of SIM. A group of JPL engineers designed, built, and tested a linear ballscrew actuator capable of performing submicron incremental steps for 10 years of continuous operation. Precise, zero backlash, closed loop pointing control requirements, lead the team to implement a ballscrew actuator with a direct drive DC motor and a precision piezo <b>brake.</b> <b>Motor</b> control commutation using feedback from a precision linear encoder on the ballscrew output produced an unexpected incremental step size of 20 nm over a range of 120 mm, yielding a dynamic range of 6, 000, 000 : 1.

40|$|Traditional {{friction}} <b>braking</b> {{torque and}} <b>motor</b> <b>braking</b> torque {{can be used}} in braking for electric vehicles (EVs). A sliding mode controller (SMC) based on the exponential reaching law for the anti-lock braking system (ABS) is developed to maintain the optimal slip value. Parameter optimizing is applied to the reaching law by fuzzy logic control (FLC). A regenerative braking algorithm, in which the motor torque is taken full advantage of, is adopted to distribute the braking force between the <b>motor</b> <b>braking</b> and the hydraulic braking. Simulations were carried out with Matlab/Simulink. By comparing with a conventional Bang-bang ABS controller, braking stability and passenger comfort is improved with the proposed SMC controller, and the chatting phenomenon is reduced effectively with the parameter optimizing by FLC.

50|$|Vacuum {{may be used}} to power, {{or provide}} {{assistance}} to mechanical devices. In hybrid and diesel engine motor vehicles, a pump fitted on the engine (usually on the camshaft) is used to produce vacuum. In petrol engines, instead, vacuum is typically obtained as a side-effect of the operation of the engine and the flow restriction created by the throttle plate, but may be also supplemented by an electrically operated vacuum pump to boost braking assistance or improve fuel consumption. This vacuum may then be used to power the following motor vehicle components: vacuum servo booster for the hydraulic <b>brakes,</b> <b>motors</b> that move dampers in the ventilation system, throttle driver in the cruise control servomechanism, door locks or trunk releases.|$|R
5000|$|Sliding {{may occur}} between two objects of {{arbitrary}} shape, whereas rolling friction is the frictional force {{associated with the}} rotational movement of a somewhat disclike or other circular object along a surface. Generally the frictional force of rolling friction is less than that associated with sliding kinetic friction.
