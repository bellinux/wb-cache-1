Characteristic results were as follows: (1) The geological composition of the study area is a sandstone and shale base，overlaid with pyroclastic fall and pyroclastic flow deposits，volcanic ash and volcanic pumice originating from eruptions of the Sakurajima Volcano. Several types of erosion and slope failure were observed within the study area. : slope failure occurring on the downhill side of the forest road，as a result of the combined effect of groundwater from between the bedrock and the pyroclastic fall deposits being augmented by an influx of rain water; shallow landslide resulting from the infiltration and concentration of rain water into surface soil in the cutting and natural slope; deep-seated landslide resulting from groundwater between the bedrock and pyroclastic fall deposits combining with an influx of rain water; failure of the subbase and subgrade <b>bearing</b> <b>body</b> of the forest road itself，as a result of groundwater between the bedrock and pyroclastic fall deposits together with an influx of rain water; and the clogging of conduits and partial failure of the forest roads themselves，as a result of inundation by sediments due to debris flow. (2) Areas of slope failure and sediment yields resulting from slope failure within the study area were investigated. The area of slope failure ranged from 16 ㎡ to 400 ㎡ (average 133 ㎡) and the sediment yield due to slope failure ranged　from 10 ㎥ to 1, 600 ㎥ (average 223 ㎥).

40|$|Abstract: Floods are {{a devastating}} kind of natural disaster. About {{half of the}} {{population}} in China lives in rural areas. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the flood disaster risk of rural housings. The results are valuable for guiding the rescue and relief goods layout. In this study, we take the severe flood disaster that happened at Kouqian Town in Jilin, China in 2010 as an example to build an risk assessment system for flood disaster on rural housings. Based on the theory of natural disaster risk formation and “ 3 S ” technology (remote sensing, geography information systems and global positioning systems), taking the rural housing as the <b>bearing</b> <b>body,</b> we assess the flood disaster risk from three aspects: hazard, exposure and vulnerability. The hazard presented as the flood submerging range and depth. The exposure presented as the values of the housing and the property in it. The vulnerability presented as the relationship between the losses caused by flood and flood depth. We validate the model by the field survey after the flood disaster. The risk assessment results highly coincide with the field survey losses. This model can be used to assess the risk of other flood events in this area...|$|E
40|$|The {{correlation}} among lymphoid infiltration (LI) in {{the primary}} tumor, cell-mediated immunity and the accumulative 5 -year survival rate was studied in 515 patients with resected gastric cancer. As scales of cell-mediated immunity, the blastformation rate of peripheral lymphocytes against phytohemagglutinin (PHA) -M (Difco) and the PPD skin reaction were examined. The results were as follows: 1) LI of the primary tumor was found in 124 out of 515 patients (24. 1 %); patients with marked LI were 6. 4 %. 2) The blastformation rate in patients with positive LI {{was significantly higher than}} that in patients with negative LI (p< 0. 01). 3) The LI of the primary tumor tended to be found commonly in patients with gastric cancer in clinical stage I. 4) The blastformation rate decreased when the clinical stage of gastric cancer progressed, however, this trend was not seen in patients with positive LI regardless of the stage. 5) The accumulative 5 -year survival rate in patients with positive LI was longer than that in the patients with LI negative (p< 0. 05). 6) There was no relationship among the degrees of LI {{in the primary}} tumor, the PPD skin reaction and lymphocyte count. In conclusion, LI of the primary tumor has a close relationship with the blastformation rate, and this phenomenon suggests that a local appearance of cell-mediated immunity in the cancer <b>bearing</b> <b>body</b> may occur...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the analytical {{model of the}} radial bearing of the finite length with the two-layer porous insert obtained {{on the basis of}} the dimensionless equations of movement of a viscous incompressible lubricant in an operating clearance and in porous layers of a bearing sleeve and continuity equations as well. We are analyzing the case when permeability of porous layers on the border of section of a two-layer insert accepts one value. The lubricant moves in a circumferential direction through a bore in a <b>bearing</b> <b>body</b> and the subsequent filtration occurs through insert pores. Permeability anisotropy of porous layers is taken into consideration in radial and circumferential directions. As a result of the given task, we have obtained the field of speeds and pressure in porous layers and in the lubricant layer. Analytical dependences for components of a vector of supporting force and the friction moment have been found, and we have also defined the loading factor and friction factor. Moreover, in our calculations we have revealed and used the parameter characterizing specificity of lubrication feeding in a circumferential direction. It is proved that the rational mode of operation is reached by a design of a two-layer porous insert given when the resistance factor increases more intensively and from the parameter ψ, and from a relative eccentricity ɛ in comparison with the bearing having a single-layer insert. Hence, anisotropy of permeability of porous layers in a circumferential and radial direction has a defined possibility of practical application of this new model...|$|E
