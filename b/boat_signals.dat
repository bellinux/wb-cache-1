Then I anticipated that, bein' deprived of 'is stimulant, he might react on me, so to say, with a hatchet. Consequently, {{after the final}} performance an' the ensuin' wet walk, I kep' myself aloof from my superior officer on board in the execution of 'is duty as you might put it. Consequently, I was interested when the sentry informs me while I was passin' on my lawful occasions that Click had asked to see the captain. As a general rule warrant officers don't dissipate much of the owner's time, but Click put {{in an hour and}} more be'ind that door. My duties kep' me within eyeshot of it. Vickery came out first, an' 'e actually nodded at me an' smiled. This knocked me out o' the boat, because, havin' seen 'is face for five consecutive nights, I didn't anticipate any change there more than a condenser in hell, so to speak. The owner emerged later. His face didn't read off at all, so I fell back on his cox, 'oo'd been eight years with him and knew him better than <b>boat</b> <b>signals.</b> Lamson--that was the cox's name--crossed 'is bows once or twice at low speeds an' dropped down to me visibly concerned. 'He's shipped 'is court-martial face,' says Lamson. 'Some one's goin' to be 'ung. I've never seen that look but once before when they chucked the gun-sights overboard in the Fantastic.' Throwin' gun-sights overboard, Mr. Hooper, is the equivalent for mutiny in these degenerate days. It's done to attract the notice of the authorities an' the Western Mornin' News--generally by a stoker. Naturally, word went round the lower deck an' we had a private over'aul of our little consciences. But, barrin' a shirt which a second- class stoker said 'ad walked into 'is bag from the marines flat by itself, nothin' vital transpired. The owner went about flyin' the signal for 'attend public execution,' so to say, but there was no corpse at the yardarm. 'E lunched on the beach an' 'e returned with 'is regulation harbour-routine face about 3 P. M. Thus Lamson lost prestige for raising false alarms. The only person 'oo might 'ave connected the epicycloidal gears correctly was one Pyecroft, when he was told that Mr. Vickery would go up country that same evening to take over certain naval ammunition left after the war in Bloemfontein Fort. No details was ordered to accompany Master Vickery. He was told off first person singular--as a unit---by himself." ...|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the EU Life+ project named LIFE 09 NAT/IT/ 000190 ARION, a permanent automated real-time passive acoustic monitoring system for the improvement of the conservation status of the transient and resident population of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) has been implemented and installed in the Portofino Marine Protected Area (MPA), Ligurian Sea. The system is able to detect the simultaneous presence of dolphins and boats in the area and to give their position in real time. This information is used to prevent collisions by diffusing warning messages to all the categories involved (tourists, professional fishermen and so on). The system consists of two gps-synchronized acoustic units, based on a particular type of marine buoy (elastic beacon), deployed about 1 km off the Portofino headland. Each one is equipped with a four-hydrophone array and an onboard acquisition system which can record the typical social communication whistles emitted by the dolphins and the sound emitted by <b>boat</b> engines. <b>Signals</b> are pre-filtered, digitized and then broadcast to the ground station via wi-fi.

When he approaches to take the ashes, Deputy Winslow mistakes it for Victor going to attack Marybeth, and so shoots him down, but Victor rises back up, and rips apart Winslow's chest when his back is turned. Amanda grabs the urn and rolls it back to Marybeth, telling her to try it again, as she attempts to grab Winslow's gun, but Victor grabs Amanda and rips her head off. Victor then knocks Marybeth over and impales her on a tree branch, seriously injuring her. Just when Victor picks up a machete to finish Marybeth off, Marybeth smashes the urn over Victor's head, spreading his father's ashes all over him, and causing him to collapse and melt. With the last bit of her strength, she grabs one of the SWAT team's guns and blows his remains away, finally killing Victor Crowley once and for all. The National Guard then arrives and Andrew, now free of danger, emerges from the <b>boat</b> and <b>signals</b> the helicopters. Just as the screen cuts to black, one final shot of Marybeth gasping for air is shown, leaving the audience to wonder if she will live or die.|$|R

60|$|As the {{lighthouse}} advanced in height, the cubical {{contents of the}} stones were less, {{but they had to}} be raised to a greater height; and the walls, being thinner, were less commodious for the necessary machinery and the artificers employed, which considerably retarded the work. Inconvenience was also occasionally experienced from the men dropping their coats, hats, mallets, and other tools, at high-water, which were carried away by the tide; and the danger to the people themselves was now greatly increased. Had any of them fallen from the beacon or building at high-water, while the landing-master's crew were generally engaged with the craft at a distance, it must have rendered the accident doubly painful to those on the rock, who at this time had no boat, and consequently no means of rendering immediate and prompt assistance. In such cases it would have been too late to have got a <b>boat</b> by <b>signal</b> from the tender. A small boat, which could be lowered at pleasure, was therefore suspended by a pair of davits projected from the cook-house, the keel being about thirty feet from the rock. This boat, with its tackle, was put under the charge of James Glen, of whose exertions on the beacon mention has already been made, and who, having in early life been a seaman, was also very expert in the management of a boat. A life-buoy was likewise suspended from the bridge, to which a coil of line two hundred fathoms in length was attached, which could be let out to a person falling into the water, or {{to the people in the}} boat, should they not be able to work her with the oars.|$|R
40|$|This aim of {{this project}} was to explore how the process of yacht design {{informed}} {{the development of a}} 9 metre racing yacht with a canting keel. It explores the interrelationship of art and science {{in the process of developing}} the fastest yacht of its size and type in the world, with particular reference to accessibility in terms of cost, quantifiable performance and the user experience (handling characteristics and ‘feel’). The theoretical framework is based on the action research model described by Zuber-Skerrit (2001). This was in keeping with the concept of yacht design utilising a design spiral, in which each aspect of the design is explored and refined in turn, before a further iteration is developed, explored and further refined. The lack of a complete, recognised methodology for designing racing yachts has resulted in an environment which does not foster innovation, relying instead on engineering techniques which impose limitations on the design process. Designers are also limited to some extent by tradition — following what has gone before — as well as being hampered by class and rating rules. This project explored and defined a new methodological framework, blending the empirical knowledge obtained through scientific techniques with experiential wisdom and artistic input. This project involved the design development, construction and on-water testing of a 9 metre canting-keel race yacht, its appendages, rig and sails. The design was developed from first concept to a fully realised vessel, enabling thorough experiential investigation to ascertain its success. The designed output from this project was a 9 metre yacht with a reasonable design and construction cost which has consistently outperformed larger and more expensive <b>boats.</b> It <b>signals</b> that in a field increasingly dominated by mathematical models and computer-based predictions, there remains a powerful role for experiential wisdom and artistic input in creating high-performance yachts...|$|R
