5|$|Generally the {{jumping spider}} {{subfamily}} Spartaeinae, {{which includes the}} genus Portia, cannot discriminate objects at such long distances as the members of subfamilies Salticinae or Lyssomaninae can. However, members of Portia have vision about as acute as {{the best of the}} jumping spiders, for example: the salticine Mogrus neglectus can distinguish prey and conspecifics up to 320millimetres away (42times its own <b>body</b> <b>length),</b> while P. fimbriata can distinguish these up to 280millimetres (47times its own <b>body</b> <b>length).</b> The main eyes of a Portia can also identify features of the scenery up to 85times its own <b>body</b> <b>length,</b> which helps the spider to find detours.|$|E
5|$|In the holotype specimen, a female, {{the head}} and <b>body</b> <b>length</b> was 310mm (12.2in), the tail length was 210mm (8.3in), the {{hindfoot}} length was 66.8mm (2.63in), the ear length was 17.5mm (0.69in), and the body mass was 675g (24oz). In another specimen, a male which was captured and released, {{the head and}} <b>body</b> <b>length</b> was about 330mm (13in), the tail length was about 175mm (6.9in), and the body mass was 600g (21oz). Based on these limited data, S.durrelli may be slightly smaller than the brown-tailed mongoose.|$|E
5|$|Toucans are near-passerine birds {{from the}} Neotropics. They are brightly marked and have {{enormous}} colorful bills {{which in some}} species amount to half their <b>body</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E
50|$|The mite {{has been}} {{recorded}} at a speed of 322 <b>body</b> <b>lengths</b> per second (0.225 m/s). This is far {{in excess of the}} previous record holder, the Australian tiger beetle Cicindela eburneola, the fastest insect in the world relative to body size, which {{has been recorded}} at 1.86 m/s or 171 <b>body</b> <b>lengths</b> per second. The cheetah, the fastest land animal, which has been clocked at a peak of 64 mph, scores at only 16 <b>body</b> <b>lengths</b> per second.|$|R
50|$|Depending on engine type, Transit Coaches {{were sold}} in 28'(only with {{gasoline}} engines), 30', 35', 37', and 40' <b>body</b> <b>lengths.</b> The two longest <b>body</b> <b>lengths</b> only were sold with a diesel engine (the 37' could not be ordered as a 318D, a C-Series, or a VTF555-D).|$|R
50|$|The ProMaster {{is offered}} in three wheelbases (118 in, 136 in, 159 in), four overall <b>body</b> <b>lengths</b> (195 in, 213 in, 236 in, 250 in, {{with the two}} longest <b>body</b> <b>lengths</b> {{available}} only with the 159 in wheelbase), and two overall heights (88 in and 99 in).|$|R
5|$|According to arachnologist B. J. Kaston, adult {{females are}} 3.5 to 4.5mm in <b>body</b> <b>length,</b> while males are 3 to 3.5mm. The Peckhams' earlier description, however, gives {{a length of}} 3mm for females and 3 to 4.5mm for males.|$|E
5|$|For moulting, all Portias spin a {{horizontal}} web whose diameter is {{about twice the}} spider's <b>body</b> <b>length</b> and is suspended only 1 to 4millimetres below a leaf. The spider lies head down, and often slides down 20 to 30millimetres during moulting. Portias spin a similar temporary web for resting.|$|E
5|$|Measurements for {{the first}} two known {{examples}} are as follows (in each case, the first measurement given is from the holotype, taken in 1904, the second, from the specimen taken in 1966): head and <b>body</b> <b>length</b> 125 and 118mm (4.9 and 4.6in), tail length 115 and 110mm (4.5 and 4.3in), hindfoot length 27 and 28mm (1.1 and 1.1in), ear length 13 and 15mm (0.51 and 0.59in), skull length 29.8 and 29.0mm (1.17 and 1.14in). The 1966 specimen weighed 46.0g (1.62oz) and had testes 11mm (0.43in) long; these measurements were not recorded in the 1904 specimen. Reid, who mentioned the third specimen, reported a maximum head and <b>body</b> <b>length</b> of 128mm (5.0in), tail length of 150mm (5.9in), hindfoot length of 31mm (1.2in), and ear length of 19mm (0.75in).|$|E

50|$|The Pisauridae are {{hunters who}} roam about {{in search of}} prey. The females have <b>body</b> <b>lengths</b> of 11 - 19 mm. The males have <b>body</b> <b>lengths</b> of 9 - 14 mm. P. mira is found all along the eastern seaboard of the United States and west to Texas, Nebraska, and Wisconsin, {{as well as in}} Canada.|$|R

5|$|The {{size and}} weight depend on the species, as long-finned pilot whales are {{generally}} larger than short-finned pilot whales. Their lifespans are about 45 years in males and 60 years in females for both species. Both species exhibit sexual dimorphism. Adult long-finned pilot whales reach a <b>body</b> <b>length</b> of approximately 6.5 m, with males being 1 m longer than females. Their body mass reaches up to 1,300kg in females and up to 2,300kg in males. For short-finned pilot whales, adult females reach a <b>body</b> <b>length</b> of about 5.5 m, while males reach 7.2 m and may weigh up to 3,200kg.|$|E
5|$|They {{can strike}} to a {{distance}} of about one third of their <b>body</b> <b>length,</b> but juveniles will launch their entire bodies forwards in the process. These snakes rarely grip their victims, instead releasing quickly to return to the striking position.|$|E
5|$|California condors {{have the}} largest {{wingspan}} of any North American bird. They are surpassed in both <b>body</b> <b>length</b> and weight only by the trumpeter swan and the introduced mute swan. The American white pelican and whooping crane also have longer bodies than the condor. Condors are so large {{that they can be}} mistaken for a small, distant airplane, which possibly occurs more often than they are mistaken for other species of bird.|$|E
50|$|The {{respective}} <b>body</b> <b>lengths</b> of {{the sexes}} are males 3.6-4 mm, females 4.6-5.8 mm.|$|R
50|$|Initial first-instar nymphs {{are dark}} brown, with white or {{brownish}} white {{tips of the}} maxillary and labial palps. Adults measure 25-35 mm in length, and have a shiny, uniformly black to blackish-brown body, with brown tarsi and maxillary and labial palps. The adult male's wings extend slightly beyond the <b>body's</b> <b>length,</b> while the female's wings are around half the <b>body's</b> <b>length.</b>|$|R
50|$|Aysheaia was a genus of Cambrian-aged soft-bodied, caterpillar-shaped fossil organisms {{with average}} <b>body</b> <b>lengths</b> of 1-6 cm.|$|R
5|$|Its {{distribution}} is now restricted to Uruguay and nearby Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, but it previously ranged northward into Minas Gerais, Brazil, and southward into eastern Argentina. The Argentine form {{may have been}} distinct from the living form from Brazil and Uruguay. L.molitor is a large rodent, with the head and <b>body</b> <b>length</b> averaging , characterized by a long tail, large hindfeet, and long and dense fur. It builds nests above the water, supported by reeds, {{and it is not}} currently threatened.|$|E
5|$|Like other abelisaurids, the hindlimbs were stocky {{and short}} {{compared}} to <b>body</b> <b>length.</b> The tibia (lower leg bone) of Majungasaurus was even stockier {{than that of}} its relative Carnotaurus, with a prominent crest on the knee. The astragalus and calcaneum (ankle bones) were fused together, and the feet bore three functional digits, with a smaller first digit that did not contact the ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{long black}} and white tail fin can be up {{to a third of}} <b>body</b> <b>length.</b> Several {{hypotheses}} attempt to explain the humpback's pectoral fins, which are proportionally the longest fins of any cetacean. The higher maneuverability afforded by long fins and the usefulness of the increased surface area for temperature control when migrating between warm and cold climates possibly supported this adaptation.|$|E

5|$|While {{almost all}} jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods, Phaeacius does not use the usual hunting tactics. Most jumping spiders walk {{throughout}} the day, so that they maximise their chances of a catch, and jump on their prey and then bite it. Unlike most jumping spiders, Phaeacius and other spartaeines do not leap on prey, but lunge from about half the predator's <b>body</b> <b>length</b> away.|$|E
5|$|With a {{head and}} <b>body</b> <b>length</b> of , Eliurus petteri is a {{moderately}} large species of Eliurus. Its upperparts are gray-brown to gray and contrast {{sharply with the}} white underparts. The tail tuft, a characteristic feature of Eliurus, is weakly developed. The skull is delicate and the incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are short and narrow. The incisors are weak.|$|E
5|$|A full-grown Scelidosaurus {{was rather}} small {{compared}} to most later non-avian dinosaurs, {{but it was a}} medium-sized species in the Early Jurassic. Some scientists have estimated a length of 4metres (13ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave a <b>body</b> <b>length</b> of 3.8 metres (12.5ft) and a weight of 270 kilogrammes. Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up on its hind legs to browse on foliage from trees, but its arms were relatively long, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture. A trackway from the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland shows a scelidosaur like animal walking in a bipedal manner, hinting that Scelidosaurus may have been more proficient at bipedalism than previously thought.|$|E
50|$|As {{calculated}} by displacement of body size, the rufous hummingbird makes perhaps the longest migratory journey of any {{bird in the}} world. At just over 3 in long, rufous birds travel 3,900-miles one-way from Alaska to Mexico in late summer, a distance equal to 78,470,000 <b>body</b> <b>lengths.</b> By comparison, the 13-inch-long Arctic tern makes a one-way flight of about 11,185 miles, or 51,430,000 <b>body</b> <b>lengths,</b> just 65% of the body displacement during migration by rufous hummingbirds.|$|R

5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their <b>body</b> <b>length.</b> During {{the initial stages of}} development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its <b>body</b> <b>length</b> greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E
5|$|During {{the threat}} display, any sudden {{movement}} by the intruder may provoke the mamba {{into a series}} of rapid strikes leading to severe envenomation. Also, the size of the black mamba, plus its ability to raise its head well off the ground, enable it to launch as much as 40% of its <b>body</b> <b>length</b> upwards, so mamba bites in humans quite often are on the upper body. This behaviour also permits the snake to land a strike at unexpectedly long range. The black mamba's reputed readiness to attack is often much exaggerated and usually is provoked by perceived threats, such as blocking its intended retreat, accidentally or otherwise.|$|E
40|$|We {{provide a}} {{comparative}} study between two self-propelled microrobots, i. e., magnetotactic bacteria and microjets. This study includes characterization of their fluidic properties (linear and rotational drag coefficients) {{based on their}} morphologies and characterization of their magnetic properties using the rotating-field technique. Further, the control characteristics of our microrobots are evaluated in the transient- and steady-states. The average boundary frequencies of our magnetotactic bacteria and microjets are 2. 2 rad/s and 25. 1 rad/s, respectively. The characterized fluidic properties and boundary frequencies {{are used in the}} characterization of the magnetic properties of our microrobots. The average magnetic dipole moments of our magnetotactic bacteria and microjets are 1. 4 × 10 − 17 A. m 2 and 1. 5 × 10 − 13 A. m 2 at magnetic field of 2 mT and linear velocities of 32 μm/s (approximately 6 <b>body</b> <b>lengths</b> per second) and 119 μm/s (approximately 2 <b>body</b> <b>lengths</b> per second), respectively. These characterized magnetic dipole moments are utilized in the realization of closed-loop control systems for the magnetotactic bacteria and microjets. Our closed-loop control system positions the magnetotactic bacteria and the microjets within the vicinity of reference positions with average diameters of 23 μm (approximately 4 <b>body</b> <b>lengths)</b> and 417 μm (approximately 8 <b>body</b> <b>lengths),</b> respectively...|$|R
