25|$|In 2015, McDonald's {{pledged to}} stop using eggs from <b>battery</b> <b>cage</b> {{facilities}} by 2025. Since McDonald's purchases over 2 billion eggs per year or 4 percent of eggs produced in the United States, the switch {{is expected to have}} a major impact on the egg industry and is part of a general trend toward cage-free eggs driven by consumer concern over the harsh living conditions of hens. The aviary systems from which the new eggs will be sourced are troubled by much higher mortality rates, as well as introducing environmental and worker safety problems. The high hen mortality rate, which is more than double that of <b>battery</b> <b>cage</b> systems, will require new research to mitigate. The facilities also have higher ammonia levels due to faeces being kicked up into the air. Producers raised concerns about the production cost, which is expected to increase by 36 percent.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of hens {{in many countries}} are housed in battery cages, although the European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC has banned the conventional <b>battery</b> <b>cage</b> in EU states from January 2012. These are small cages, usually made of metal in modern systems, housing 3 to 8 hens. The walls are made of either solid metal or mesh, and the floor is sloped wire mesh to allow the faeces to drop through and eggs to roll onto an egg-collecting conveyor belt. Water is usually provided by overhead nipple systems, and food in a trough along {{the front of the}} cage replenished at regular intervals by a mechanical chain.|$|E

The company would require its suppliers to confine no more than five hens in each <b>battery</b> <b>cage,</b> that the birds be able to stand fully upright, and require the presence of two water drinkers per cage. It would stop purchasing from suppliers who engage in the forced molting of hens, develop auditing procedures for the handling of [...] "broiler" [...] chickens, and institute humane handling procedures for chickens at slaughterhouses.

5000|$|<b>Battery</b> <b>cages</b> are {{a housing}} system used for various animal {{production}} methods, but primarily for egg-laying hens. The name {{arises from the}} arrangement of rows and columns of identical cages connected together, sharing common divider walls, as in the cells of a battery. Although the term is usually applied to poultry farming, similar cage systems are used for other animals. <b>Battery</b> <b>cages</b> have generated controversy between advocates for animal rights, and industrial producers. <b>Battery</b> <b>cages</b> are the predominant form of housing for laying hens worldwide. They reduce aggression and cannibalism among hens, but are barren, restrict movement, prevent many natural behaviours, and increase rates of osteoporosis. As of 2014, approximately 95% of eggs in the US were produced in battery cages.In the UK, statistics from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) indicate that 50% of eggs produced in the UK throughout 2010 were from cages (45% from free-range, 5% from barns). [...] However, introduction of the European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC which banned conventional <b>battery</b> <b>cages</b> in the EU from January 2012 for welfare reasons, means the number of eggs from <b>battery</b> <b>cages</b> in the EU states is rapidly decreasing.|$|R

40|$|In Switzerland eggs {{have not}} been {{produced}} in <b>battery</b> <b>cages</b> since January 1992. During the 10 year period from 1981 farmers replaced their <b>battery</b> <b>cages</b> with deep litter, aviary and grid-floor systems and modified cages. However, the cages used to replace the conventional <b>battery</b> <b>cages</b> {{and most of the}} grid- floor systems did not fulfil the requirements of the Swiss Welfare Act and they were not permitted to be advertised or sold thereafter. Sixteen years after the ban on <b>battery</b> <b>cages,</b> the Federal Veterinary Office has undertaken a survey to determine how laying hens are kept in Switzerland and how the alternative systems have fared. The survey was carried out on 96 randomly chosen farms with at least 500 hen places {{to find out more about}} the housing conditions, management processes, status and performance of hens. The results show that aviaries are very common in Switzerland (65 % of the laying hens) and that the laying performance in these systems is significantly higher than that in grid- floor systems and similar to that in <b>battery</b> <b>cages.</b> Provision of a protected outdoor area is a valuable benefit. To be successful with aviary systems it is necessary for pullets to spend the rearing period under similar housing condition...|$|R
