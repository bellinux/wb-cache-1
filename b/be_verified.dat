Multimedia documents are interpreted as object model instances of a multimedia document metamodel. Structural properties <b>are</b> <b>verified</b> using consistency reasoning over an ontology representation of the given object model together with OCL invariant validation (i. e., the application of OCL invariants to the given object model). Behavioral properties <b>are</b> <b>verified</b> through model checking on the transition system associated to the given multimedia document.
