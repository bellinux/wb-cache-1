50|$|Hadley v Baxendale 1854 EWHC J70 is {{a leading}} English {{contract}} law case. It sets the basic rule to determine consequential damages from a breach of contract: a <b>breaching</b> <b>party</b> is liable for all losses that the contracting parties should have foreseen, but is not liable for any losses that the <b>breaching</b> <b>party</b> could not have foreseen on the information available to him.|$|E

50|$|The courts, then, have {{exercised}} their {{discretion to}} relax {{the principle of}} reciprocity where a <b>breaching</b> <b>party</b> has made defective or part-performance, which the innocent party has nonetheless begun to use; and where the innocent party (using the exceptio) is refusing to pay until full performance is made. In these circumstances, a court may order the party making use of the defective or incomplete performance to pay a reduced amount to the party in breach. The onus to prove {{the amount of the}} reduction is on the <b>breaching</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E

50|$|Although the Charter is the party's highest {{document}} de jure, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il <b>breached</b> <b>party</b> protocol {{during their}} rule by not convening party Congresses or Central Committee plenums.

5|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the party discipline inspection system mirrors that of the MOS, with the CCDI responsible for cases involving <b>breaches</b> of <b>party</b> discipline and state law by party members. Like the MOS, the CCDI lacks judicial authority and is limited to investigating allegations of corruption and <b>breaches</b> of <b>party</b> discipline. Since the CCDI {{does not have the}} power to prosecute, it is supposed to transfer cases (after investigation) to the Supreme People's Procuratorate or the Supreme People's Court. Despite this, its formal jurisdiction is loosely defined. The CDI's ability to begin investigations and administer party sanctions has often led to the slow transfer (or sometimes no transfer) of cases to the Supreme People's Procuratorate.|$|R
50|$|At this time, {{the party}} was {{infiltrated}} by an apparent British agent, Lai Teck, who became Secretary-General in April 1939. Despite this severe security <b>breach,</b> the <b>Party</b> continued to operate effectively. By mid-1939 it claimed about 40,000 members, about half in Singapore.|$|R
5000|$|Reasonable {{certainty}} - {{must be able}} {{to calculate}} the damages based on reasonably certain facts or comparable situations. Cannot have a calculation based wholly on guesses. In cases of doubt, many jurisdictions have adopted a view that the <b>breaching</b> <b>party</b> should bear the risk of doubt rather than the aggrieved party.|$|E
50|$|Where the {{innocent}} party receives and starts using part-performance or defective performance, the contract cannot then be cancelled, as an election {{to keep the}} contract alive has been made, but {{the innocent}} party may raise the exceptio. Where the contract has been lawfully cancelled, the innocent party becomes liable to the <b>breaching</b> <b>party</b> for restitution of any performance received.|$|E
5000|$|When it {{is either}} not {{possible}} or not desirable to award the victim in that way, a court may award money damages designed to restore the injured party to the economic position s/he occupied {{at the time the}} contract was entered (known as the [...] "reliance measure"), or designed to prevent the <b>breaching</b> <b>party</b> from being unjustly enriched ("restitution") (see below).|$|E

50|$|For a {{defendant}} {{to be held}} liable, it must be shown that the particular acts or omissions were {{the cause of the}} loss or damage sustained. Although the notion sounds simple, the causation between one's breach of duty and the harm that results to another can at times be very complicated. The basic test is to ask whether the injury would have occurred 'but for', or without, the accused party's breach of the duty owed to the injured party. In Australia, the High Court has held that the 'but for' test is not the exclusive test of causation because it cannot address a situation where {{there is more than one}} cause of damage. When 'but for' test is not satisfied and the case is an exceptional one, a commonsense test ('Whether and Why' test) will be appliedEven more precisely, if a <b>breaching</b> <b>party</b> materially increases the risk of harm to another, then the <b>breaching</b> <b>party</b> can be sued to the value of harm that he caused.|$|E
50|$|Penal damages are {{liquidated}} damages which exceed reasonable compensatory damages, making them invalid under common law. While liquidated damage clauses set a pre-agreed {{value on the}} expected loss to one party if the other party were to breach the contract, penal damages go further and seek to penalise the <b>breaching</b> <b>party</b> beyond the reasonable losses from the breach. Many clauses which {{are found to be}} penal are expressed as {{liquidated damages}} clauses but have been seen by courts as excessive and thus invalid.|$|E
50|$|The {{predecessor}} {{unions to}} the National Union of Railwaymen and the National Union of Seamen were founding {{members of the}} original Labour Representation Committee and after its creation the RMT became a prominent voice on {{the left of the}} Labour Party. In 2003 some Scottish branches of the RMT voted to donate some of their funds to the Scottish Socialist Party in protest against the policies of Tony Blair and New Labour, such as not renationalising the railways. This led the Labour Party to disaffiliate from the union in early 2004 for <b>breaching</b> <b>Party</b> rules.|$|E

In 2000, Lin's Kuomintang membership was revoked after he {{was found to have}} <b>breached</b> <b>party</b> regulations during the 2000 presidential election. He was reelected in 2001 {{as a member of the}} People First Party and won a third term in 2004. That year, Lin and Liao Kuo-tung led a protest against Vice President Annette Lu, after she stated that aborigines were not the first people to live in Taiwan and that the group should move to Central America. Lin ran again in the legislative elections of 2008 and finished fourth in the Highland Aborigine district. In February, Lin was indicted for vote buying.|$|R

5000|$|... 2. Pricing in. In {{most cases}} of breach, {{a party to}} the {{contract}} simply fails to perform one or more terms. In those cases, the <b>breaching</b> <b>party</b> should have already considered the cost to perform those terms and thus [...] "keeps" [...] that cost when they do not perform. That party should not be entitled to keep that savings. However, in the pipe example the contractor never considered the cost of tearing down a house to fix the pipes, and so it is not reasonable to expect them to pay damages of that nature.|$|E

50|$|When a {{customer}} exceeds {{his or her}} overdraft limit, this constitutes a breach of contract, as the customer has agreed not to borrow more than agreed. When this happens, the injured party (in this case the bank) is entitled to be reimbursed with a reasonable sum {{to cover the costs}} it has incurred {{as a result of the}} breach, or otherwise the value of the injury expressed in cash terms (liquidated damages). The value does not have to reflect the actual amount of the losses, only that it is a reasonable estimate of such. If the amount demanded by the injured party is excessive, they are unjustly enriched, and the <b>breaching</b> <b>party</b> has no obligation to pay the excess.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} aspect of the study of breach of contract is that of the need for termination of the breached contract for the recovery of damages. It is suggested that the classification of damages, by describing them, variously, as being ‘expectation’, or ‘loss of bargain’, damages, or for anticipatory breach, gives limited guidance as to whether termination of the breached contract is a prerequisite for their recovery. This short article advances the discrete argument that in order to determine if termination of the breached contract is necessary for the recovery of damages, a practitioner’s enquiries could be more usefully focussed upon ascertaining whether the damages sought to be recovered are in respect of the consequences of the loss arising from the <b>breaching</b> <b>party’s</b> unperformed obligations, rather than adopting the criteria of ‘expectation’, or ‘loss of bargain’, losses, or for anticipatory breach, as the case may be...|$|R
50|$|A {{father and}} son pair of Tan Soo Phuan and Tan Lead Shake stood as {{candidates}} for the party in the 1997 and 2001 general elections, though they did not achieve much electoral success. Tan Soo Phuan lost his election deposit of S$6,000 at the 1997 general election after he failed to achieve the necessary threshold of 12.5% of the votes which was required to retain his deposit in Chua Chu Kang SMC. In the 2001 general election, Tan Lead Shake lost the election deposit of S$13,000 in Ayer Rajah SMC for the same reason. In July 2002, both {{father and son}} were subsequently expelled from the DPP for <b>breaching</b> <b>party's</b> orders during the 2001 general election.
