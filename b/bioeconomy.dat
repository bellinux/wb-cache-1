40|$|This {{dissertation}} is an ethnography of potentiation the labourious {{processes by}} which potential is imagined and materialized. It investigates how life scientists and engineers potentiate algae as alternative sustainable biofuels {{in the wake of}} the global food versus fuel debate of the late 2000 s. I draw on two years of multi-sited ethnographic research conducted in the United States and Turkey to document why, how, and to what end do algal biofuel advocates figure algae as a material brimming with potential. I show that this potential is grounded in the reproductive capacities of algae as a life form, through its activation in environmental remediation projects, and through its compatibility with new biotechnologies and bioeconomic markets. At its heart, this dissertation troubles the notion of potentiality in two ways: it disrupts imaginaries of algaes potential as a natural, innate sustainable energy resource, while it simultaneously de-naturalizes ideas about the inherent potential of the United States as the hegemonic model of all <b>bioeconomies.</b> I begin with a historical overview of biofuels research in the United States and Turkey to demonstrate national differences in algal biofuel advocacy. While state and governmental initiatives profoundly shape algal biofuels research in the United States, the biofuels sector is actively sidelined by the Turkish state. As this dissertation demonstrates, Turkish scientists instead have sought to fill this science and energy policy vacuum by modeling algal biofuels inside their imaginaries of modernity. As such, this dissertation intends to provincialize American-centered accounts of <b>bioeconomies.</b> Further, it contributes to STS literature on <b>bioeconomies</b> by examining how biovalue is made within systems, as well as inside of the frameworks of systems biology and integrated systems of production. By drawing on fieldwork conducted inside laboratories, conferences, and critical textual analyses, I coin the analytic of built ecologies the infrastructures such as test tubes and photobioreactors to unpack how sustainable algal biofuels are made and remade inside of designed and engineered processes. Challenging these processes, this dissertation instead invites readers to explore alternate ways of engaging with algae and biofuels as a way to confront relentless reductions of life forms into energetic biomass...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Biomass is a {{resource}} that economically stands out from {{other types of}} resources. Implementation of <b>bioeconomies</b> based on more efficient and more versatile utilisation of biomass is in the focus of European and national agendas. At the same time, industrial ecology has emerged as central discipline aiming towards transferring sustainability ideas and sustainability principles into practice. In this context, non-biogenic resources are covered with priority, while the topic biomass is more rarely covered as an explicit issue. This paper highlights elements that are central to understand the role of biomass {{in the context of}} industrial ecology, and in particular basic differences that exist compared to other material resources.

40|$|In {{studying}} Hoodia {{patent law}} struggles, I {{am interested in}} how sovereign power, {{in the service of}} neoliberal <b>bioeconomies,</b> values some forms of knowledge over others. I examine how techniques of governmentality such as patent law, benefit sharing contracts, bioprospecting permits, and prior informed consent agreements are being used to structure inequitable forms of citizenship based upon whose knowledge and intellectual labor matters more to the neoliberal project of the nation-state. In particular, I ask how relevant social actors make claims for rights, benefits, and protection under the law based upon a vulnerability to their processes and ways of knowing in order to participate more fully within global market economies. In addition, I examine how social actors articulate, position, and rework concepts of nature and culture as they describe their practices related to the plant in order to secure rights under patent law and benefit sharing legislation...|$|R

30|$|The {{innovation}} {{farming system}} in Mexico is highly heterogeneous; high-tech sectors (e.g. tomatoes and vegetables production) coexist with traditional and labor intensive sectors (Dutrénit et al., 2016). Low productivity levels in traditional sectors {{ask for the}} application of new scientific and technological knowledge, but also new ways of organization. There is wide room for the introduction of social and inclusive innovations supporting sustainable development and biodiversity preservation. Previous studies show the importance of establishing new links between two actors in this innovation system, namely university researchers and producers and farmers. The success depends on the learning capabilities of the rural population and the critical role played by some innovation bridges and transfer organizations in promoting and supporting new relationships (Vera-Cruz and Dutrénit, 2016; Dutrénit et al., 2012; Ekboir et al., 2009). In the following paragraphs some exemplar cases are briefly described, to explore various types of <b>bioeconomies,</b> suited for the combination of fostering sustainability and social inclusion.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Taylor & Francis via the DOI in this record. The STS and bioethical literature on umbilical cord blood (UCB) banking nowadays discusses the field as divided into opposite institutional arrangements, public versus private banking. Public banks represent a model sharing economy, private banks a market economy that capitalizes hopes and tissues, and new hybrid forms that are emerging. We challenge that this distinction is analytically valuable for understanding {{the various forms of}} marketization, commodification and biovalue production that mark the UCB economy. Our analysis of current UCB banking practices, especially hybrid one’s, and their inherent visions of the future, shows that hybrid UCB banking criss-crosses the different economic models and concepts of commodification. The private, public, hybrid distinction is thus inadequate for a critically analysis of the complex UCB <b>bioeconomies.</b> Drawing on the perspective of social welfare systems analysis, however, the tripartite distinction emphasises an important ethical and biopolitical commitment to equality in current and future health care...|$|R
40|$|Research {{on blood}} and organ {{donation}} in the UK reveal disparities between {{the proportions of}} women and men donating tissues. In this paper, we examine how gender dynamics shape human tissue donation for research and for human health. We consider the research use of aborted foetal tissue in stem cell science and in a placental research biobank; the therapeutic use of peripheral blood, plasma, and umbilical cord blood; and breastmilk donation for infant feeding. We consider how donors of these tissues view donation, and to what extent the relations between bodies, technologies, kinship, community and exchange inform their views on, and participation in, donation. We also explore how tissues derived from gendered bodies acquire value as they are transformed into scientific objects, stem cell therapies, transplants and nutritional products. Within the <b>bioeconomies</b> of human tissue donation, the supply and demand for different tissues is structured by gendered understandings of the safety, risks and benefits of donation and transplant technologies, which in turn impact on the experience of donation and outcomes for recipients of donated tissues...|$|R

40|$|Second {{generation}} biofuels {{derived from}} agricultural lignocellulosic waste represent what is {{hoped to be}} a significant technological, but also socio-economic advance beyond the shortcomings of first generation biofuels (chiefly bioethanol). The development of advanced catalytic techniques is a central part of making such technologies viable. However, assessing the potential socio-economic significance of the socio-technical arrangements necessary to translate such fundamental techniques into mature technologies is also a central part of shaping the development of second generation technologies in a way that both avoids the shortcomings of first generation fuels and ensures that future developments are genuinely responsive to social needs. A pilot project is described in which a deliberative workshop with farmers in Wales is used to explore the potential societal impacts of novel nanocatalysis methods for the production of lignocellulosic biofuels developed by members of the research team. Using risk- and benefit-ranking/issue mapping methodologies, the workshop examined the potential future role of <b>bioeconomies</b> of different scales, in which second generation biofuels play a significant part, in transforming rural communities. Grounded scepticism from workshop participants delineated key socio-technical issues that will be highly consequential for the development of second-generation technologies, thus laying the ground for subsequent planned work on responsible innovation and nanocatalytic methods of biofuel production...|$|R
40|$|Creating {{sustainable}} <b>bioeconomies</b> for the 21 st century {{relies on}} optimizing {{the use of}} biological resources to improve agricultural productivity and create new products. Arbuscular mycorrhizae (phylum Glomeromycota) form symbiotic relationships with over 80 % of vascular plants. In return for carbon, these fungi improve plant health and tolerance to environmental stress. This symbiosis is over 400 million years old and there are currently over 200 known arbuscular mycorrhizae, with dozens of new species described annually. Metagenomic sequencing of native soil communities, from species-rich meadows to mangroves, suggests biologically diverse habitats support a variety of mycorrhizal species with potential agricultural, medical, and biotechnological applications. This review looks at the effect of mycorrhizae on plant metabolism {{and how we can}} harness this symbiosis to improve crop health. I will first describe the mechanisms that underlie this symbiosis and what physiological, metabolic, and environmental factors trigger these plant-fungal relationships. These include mycorrhizal manipulation of host genetic expression, host mitochondrial and plastid proliferation, and increased production of terpenoids and jasmonic acid by the host plant. I will then discuss the effects of mycorrhizae on plant root and foliar secondary metabolism. I subsequently outline how mycorrhizae induce three key benefits in crops: defense against pathogen and herbivore attack, drought resistance, and heavy metal tolerance. I conclude with an overview of current efforts to harness mycorrhizal diversity to improve crop health through customized inoculum. I argue future research should embrace synthetic biology to create mycorrhizal chasses with improved symbiotic abilities and potentially novel functions to improve plant health. As the effects of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance increase, the global diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi should be monitored and protected to ensure this important agricultural and biotechnological resource for the future...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that a {{consortium}} of NGOs has {{played a significant role}} in shaping the market for, and restricting the use of, biofuels as an alternative to conventional fuels for road transport in Europe. This paper considers why a number of NGOs (Greenpeace, Oxfam, WWF, RSPB, Friends of the Earth) have chosen to enter the biofuels debate, and how they have variously developed policy, agreed a political campaign, and exercised political influence, in a key area of the world's response to major global climate change: how to reduce the carbon footprint of transport. We found that in many cases the development of NGO policy has been driven more by narrow political opportunities for influence than by broader and more coherent policy responses to global climate change or economic development, or indeed rigorous assessment of the scientific evidence. The research provides evidence of how NGO policies and lobbying significantly affected biofuel policy changes, review processes, target reductions, and sustainability regulation in the UK and in Europe. We consider that politically instituted markets, such as the one for biofuels, are examples of the emergence of new forms of governance of capitalist political economies facing a novel and pressing combination of drivers (climate change, energy security, resource constraints, and sustainable land-use). Politically instituted markets open up possibilities for political intervention from non-governmental or party-political actors, in ways that other markets do not. If political shaping of markets by NGOs becomes more widespread, issues of democratic legitimacy and public scrutiny will become ever more pressing. The paper is based on in-depth interviews with senior scientific directors and policy-makers in five NGOs, and of senior officials in UK government departments and the European Commission (DG Environment and DG Transport and Energy).

40|$|Through {{an archive}} of court cases, prison interviews, morgue reports, film, and video, I {{argue that the}} promise of liberal {{democracy}} and the larger projects of humanism are built through the slaughter {{of other types of}} (non) sociality. Specifically, I attend to the murders of trans and queer people of color, histories of racialized violence, prisons, HIV/AIDS, and the animal industrial complex to knot together spaces of friction where non-mimetic histories might tell us something about one another. In other words, my project is not about substituting abject bodies, but shows how mechanisms of destruction are used and reused in the multiple projects of epistemic violence. To this end, I am interested in the ontological limits for those named as objects, under relentless force. Utilizing theories of the postcolonial, work in Black studies, feminist science studies, political and <b>bioeconomies,</b> and psychoanalysis, I argue that queer life is necessarily produced as the underside of gender normative, able bodied, white heterosexuality. Queer Remains is about the material remains of trans and queer people, the flesh and bones of those that once were, and also indexes the ways past violations haunt the present. The introduction, "The Afterlives of Social Death" opens with a reading of a closed circuit TV scene of Duanna Johnson, a black trans woman who was brutally beaten by Mississippi police while in custody in 2009. Here I situate my work, and its interventions, in various genealogies of Black, Queer, and Trans studies. The first chapter, "Queer Crypts: Overkill and Ontological Capture," thinks through an archive I assembled of murdered trans and queer people. I work through the gruesome horror of these murders to try to piece together a reading of violence that resists the "bad apple" model that popular LGBT politics argues. The true terror is not only in the pageantry of the murders, but the reality that they are not "outlaw practices," rather they constitute the norm of dominant culture. My second chapter, "Necrocapital: AIDS/Affective Accumulation/Viral Labor," argues that even within the biopolitical state, the reproduction of death is also a space of capitalist accumulation. The violence I highlight is the reality that the HIV cell lines are the alienated cell labor of a person living with HIV, and this labor produces drugs that the same laborer {{might not be able to}} afford. My third chapter, "Forced Life: Animality, Trans Captivity and Abolitionist Time," is an extended meditation on forms of "living" that might signify a space of (non) being more unthinkable than death. This chapter's materiality is the dual histories of the prison industrial complex and factory animal farming. Here I am interested in resituating abolition as a way of dislodging the work of humanism as the barometer of liberation. My conclusion, "Death Drops," offers a reading of a 14 -year old gay youth's suicide letter, written before he hanged himself in 2010. While such acts are read to be pathological, Seth Walsh suggests in his note that he hopes by taking his own life, he will make those who bullied him "hurt like [he] hurts. " Here I position the devastating act of queer suicide as a form of revolutionary violence and not only a "cry for help," but also a demand for action...|$|R
