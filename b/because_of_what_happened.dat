5|$|All of the Links are cleaned twice weekly, with LinkNYC staff {{removing}} vandalism {{and dirt}} from the Links. Each Link has cameras and over 30 vibration sensors to sense if the kiosk {{has been hit}} by an object. A separate set of sensors also detects if the USB ports are tampered with. If either the vibration sensors or the USB port sensors detect tampering, an alert is displayed at LinkNYC headquarters that the specific part of the Link has been affected. All of the Links have a backup battery power supply that can last for up to 24 hours if a long-term power outage were to occur. This is <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> {{in the aftermath of}} Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which caused power outages citywide, especially to the city's payphones (which were connected to the municipal power supply of New York City).|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Tommy's fight with Kane, Tommy and Marty plan to force Kane to exhaust himself {{pursuing}} Tommy until the seventh round and then put him away. The plan works and Tommy knocks out Kane in round seven. After the fight Marty plans to take everyone out for a celebratory dinner but Bob Silver (Paul Raci), a big-time promoter, has watched the fight and, impressed, invites them all out. Marty declines and goes home, but later that night is taken to the hospital. Tommy rushes {{to the hospital and}} finds Diane there. He asks if Marty is in the hospital <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> at the cabin. Diane tells him that when Marty was a fighter, people threatened to expose Marty's homosexuality, so he ended his career by putting his hand through a window and damaging it. He became a teacher and his influence led Diane to make herself a success. When Marty is released, Tommy moves in with him temporarily to help him recuperate.|$|E

Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said [...] "I think Boston...really are...a mirror image of us in terms of...aggressiveness and desire to win". Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina summarized the build-up: [...] "This is what everyone was hoping for...it's a rematch of last year, with the best two teams in the American League".|$|E
2500|$|While {{appearing}} in Sweet Charity, Applegate broke her foot, {{and it was}} announced that the musical would close during previews. She persuaded the producers to rescind their decision and on April 18, 2005, she made her Broadway debut. [...] Because of her injury, Applegate had to wear special shoes to prevent another incident, and in a 2013 interview said that <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> she [...] "actually can't dance anymore. And that is sad for me because I always wanted to go back. But I probably won't be able to." [...] She does dance whenever the opportunity presents, but cannot do any more strenuous roles.|$|E
2500|$|The tour {{rolled on}} with Australia and Japan, where the band busied {{themselves}} with press junkets and appearances. Crowds were, according to journalist Joe Shooman, mainly Blink-182 fans. Hoppus relished {{the opportunity to}} return to smaller, more intimate club dates rather than the massive arenas of latter-day Blink. The band spent April to June 2007 on the Honda Civic Tour of the US and Canada alongside Fall Out Boy, The Academy Is… and Paul Wall. The band began slipping old Blink songs—"What's My Age Again?" [...] and [...] "The Rock Show"—into setlists, despite the band's rather adamant stance against doing so months before. [...] "Travis and I love our history with Blink-182, and it seems a shame to let those songs sit dormant forever <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> two years ago," [...] said Hoppus on his blog. Hoppus later joined Panic! at the Disco on one date for an acoustic run-through of [...] "What's My Age Again?".|$|E

5|$|Betances' {{last days}} were chaotic, not only <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the events in}} the Caribbean, but also <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happening</b> in his own household. Jiménez' mental state is {{reported}} as dubious by then. Some even suggest that she had become an alcoholic (probably) or even a morphine addict (unlikely) by then, and she even wished for her husband to die in tantrums reported by his doctors. Political foes attempted to gain possession of Betances' intelligence dossiers, as did Spanish intelligence agents in Paris. Betances asked personal friends to keep personal guard of him, which they did until he died.|$|R

2500|$|As {{opposition}} leader, Livni {{noted in}} a 2009 Knesset speech that she herself did not support Yitzhak Rabin's policies at the time. [...] "The dispute is around {{the question of whether}} you can have it both ways—maintaining Israel as a Jewish state and keeping the entire Land of Israel," [...] she said. Political analysts see Livni's speech at the 2003 commemoration rally for Rabin as a turning point in her political career when she became more popular among the Israeli peace camp. She delivered a speech which many found deeply moving in which she said the day Rabin was murdered was [...] "the day that the skies fell down on me <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to us, to all the citizens of Israel." [...] As foreign minister, Livni would again attend the memorial for Rabin in 2009. Labor Party officials were not keen on this idea, fearing that her appearance would cost them votes. Some Kadima officials also seemed reluctant, fearing her appearance at left-wing event would send some votes Likud's way. Livni attended the memorial for Rabin in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Vikernes {{was arrested}} on 19 August 1993 in Bergen. The police found 150kg of {{explosives}} and 3,000 rounds of ammunition in his home. According to Jeffrey Kaplan in his book Encyclopedia of White Power, Vikernes [...] "intended to blow up Blitz House, the radical leftist and anarchist enclave in Oslo", a plan which [...] "was reportedly {{on the verge of}} execution." [...] In an article originally published in 1999, Kevin Coogan also mentioned Vikernes' alleged intent to [...] "destroy an Oslo-based punk anti-fascist squat called Blitz House," [...] and stated [...] "Vikernes may have felt that {{he had no choice but}} to kill Euronymous before bombing Blitz House because 'the Communist' would almost certainly have opposed such an act." [...] Vikernes denied these claims in a 2009 interview, stating [...] "I was getting [...] in order to defend Norway if we were attacked any time. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union could have decided to attack us. We have no reason to trust neither the government, the royal family or the military <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> last time we were attacked. We are left to ourselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in Quebec in {{the winter}} of 1998, Hydro-Quebec TransEnergie created a De-icing machine to insure that another event like this wouldn't happen again. The De-icer is a [...] machine that runs a high direct current (DC) into a {{selected}} transmission line in order to melt the ice on it. However, because the operation in this mode may be very infrequent, when the installation is not being used as a De-icer it is used as a Static Var Compensator, SVC for short, by using the HVDC valves as a Thyristor Controlled Reactor. An innovative design is used, minimizing the power losses of the valves in SVC mode. The reason an AC current wasn't used is because AC current requires a lot of reactive support. It would take a much higher amount of voltage to push the necessary current through the line.The high voltage system in Quebec runs in two transmission corridors, one high voltage system runs in the north-west from the main load centres of Montreal and Quebec and the other runs north-east along the Saint-Lawrence river. It is the latter corridor that is mainly in an area prone to ice storms that deposit ice on the transmission lines.|$|E

50|$|People do {{the things}} they do <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to them when they do it. If the {{behavior}} leads to a positive consequence that behavior will likely increase. On the other hand, if the consequences are punishing, the behavior will likely decrease. In medicine, there are specific positive outcomes in following the provider's plan of care. The problem is that these positive outcomes may be weeks, months or even years into the future. In many instances the positive consequences can occur quickly but they are below the level that people can perceive them. Awareness of the consequences of doing any behavior is an essential element for behavior change. Whether the consequences of treatment are good or bad, not being aware that anything has resulted from the treatment is essentially the same as extinction.|$|R
2500|$|In 1999, a car {{accident}} with David Hayward (Vincent Irizarry) leaves Erica's face disfigured. This storyline unintentionally mirrored a similar {{car accident}} Lucci was involved in, in 1966 which almost permanently scarred her face. Like Erica, she needed plastic surgery. In the storyline, Erica and David fall in love while he helps her through her recovery. The obstacles designed to come between them are her continued feelings for Dimitri and his inability to fully give himself to a woman <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to his father when he loved his mother too much. They become {{engaged to be married}} but Erica calls it off. She next falls in love with Chris Stamp (Jack Scalia). [...] "I really think that she found someone very special in Chris Stamp," [...] Lucci said. [...] "They are a pretty hot combination, and he seems strong and capable enough of being with her." [...] In the story, after becoming engaged to Chris, Erica cheats on him with Jack and Chris is killed. She and Jack marry in 2005. They form a family unit including all of their combined children. The union does not last, as they grow apart and Erica cheats on him with Jeff Martin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{founding}} {{leader of}} the group, David Chemla was born in Tunisia and raised in France. He was a former IDF officer {{who served in the}} Yom Kippur War in the Paratroopers Brigade. He left for France in 1977 after 10 years in Israel. He is chairman of Peace Now in France. He said the group seeks to support Israel's long-term future because [...] "as friends, as Jews, we {{want to tell you that}} you are going down a wrong path. I think our initiative is actually helping Israel's image in Europe. It is a pretty low image over here these days, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in Gaza, mainly, and it is commonly believed in Europe that Israel is the provocative, negative side of the conflict—the one that is blocking the peace process." [...] He claimed that [...] "We’re not saying that only Israel is responsible for the problem. As Jews tied to Israel, we speak to the Israelis. So this is a call to the Israelis, but of course [...] have a lot of the responsibility for the continuation of the conflict." [...] He affirmed, on behalf of the membership that [...] "our connection to the state of Israel is part of our identity," [...] but in Europe [...] "Israel is seen as responsible for all the problems [...]" [...] Chemla added that the group's was not a movement as such after the first petition but hoped to become one.|$|E
2500|$|Seven {{months after}} his {{departure}} from WWE, Hebner debuted for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling at Against All Odds pay-per-view on February 12, 2006. He officiated the main event, which saw Canadian born Christian Cage defeat Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, commentators Mike Tenay and Don West alluded to the Montréal Screwjob on several occasions, urging Hebner not to call for the bell when Jarrett placed Cage in a sharpshooter. Despite {{the concerns of the}} commentators, Hebner was an impartial referee. However, he once again caused controversy based on his actions at the TNA Slammiversary 2006 pay-per-view. During the King of the Mountain match, he assisted Jeff Jarrett in winning the match by pushing a ladder over with Sting and then-champion Christian Cage on it. This led to the new head of management Jim Cornette taking the belt from Jarrett as the show ended, leaving the status of the belt in question as to who would be the champion. On the June 22 episode of TNA Impact!, Cornette vacated the title. On the June 30 episode, he awarded the title to Jarrett, but fired (kayfabe) Hebner. Hebner was then reinstated by Cornette due to Jarrett's polygraph test saying that Hebner was not involved. Earl currently serves as a referee for Impact. Hebner was punched in the face by Jeff Jarrett and was kayfabe injured. At No Surrender he replaced original referee Slick Johnson for the TNA Knockout Tag Team Championship match <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> at Victory Road.|$|E
60|$|If ever any one {{was sorry}} for having played pranks on other folks, that one was Peter Rabbit. I am afraid it wasn't quite {{the right kind of}} sorrow. You see, he wasn't sorry <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> had <b>happened</b> to Jimmy Skunk and Reddy Fox, but <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> had <b>happened</b> to himself. There he was, down in the bedroom of Johnny Chuck's old house, smarting and aching all over from the sharp little lances of the Yellow Jackets who had driven him down there before he had {{had a chance to see}} <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to Reddy Fox. That was bad enough, but what troubled Peter more was the thought that he couldn't get out without once again facing those hot-tempered Yellow Jackets. Peter wished with all his might that he had known about their home in Johnny Chuck's old house before ever he thought of hiding there.|$|R

[...] The poem then goes on to say the author is sick about hearing about the Holocaust because it lasted only 15 years compared to the 400 years blacks had been suffering. Lester asked Campbell [...] "Are you crazy?". Campbell replied [...] "No. I think it's important for people to know the kinds of feelings being aroused in at least one child <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> <b>happening</b> in Ocean Hill-Brownsville.".
