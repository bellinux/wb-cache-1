Mari-An Santos of Philippine Entertainment Portal highly recommended it as [...] "a well-crafted film, from script to direction and acting to post-production ... it's a damn good film". Phillip Cu-Unjieng of Philippine Daily Inquirer praised the ensemble cast as [...] "top-notch" [...] and the film as [...] "dark, brooding, muscular and visceral, yet complex and concise in its story-telling".|$|E

The band felt that the songs on the album were incomplete and needed more time to be deemed finalized. The band also announced that it would be celebrating the 10-year anniversary of The Devil and God are Raging Inside Me by playing it in its entirety the remainder of the tour. There also were more statements alluding to the band's end: [...] "What’s left should be a strange demise, <b>but</b> <b>hopefully</b> one as loud and as fun as the rest of our time together has been.

In the interview, [...] Gates provided his perspective on [...] climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: [...] "... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, <b>but</b> <b>hopefully</b> none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism." [...] Gates also identified innovation as the [...] "real driver of progress" [...] and pronounced that [...] "America's way better today than it's ever been." ...|$|E
500|$|Rob Stringer, the {{chairman}} of the Epic Label Group, stated {{that at the time of}} the song's release he did not know when Jackson’s original tape had been recorded or of its similarity to Sa-Fire's version until it was discussed online over the weekend by Jackson's fans. Prior to the estate and Anka reaching an agreement, Sa-Fire’s manager, Sal Abbatiello, stated that he was contemplating filing a lawsuit on behalf of his client, commenting [...] "This is a terrible mistake [...] I’m pretty sure Paul Anka has a big case. I don’t know if Sa-Fire has any legal right as the artist. I’ll have to contact my lawyers. <b>But,</b> <b>hopefully.</b> They’re advertising this movie everywhere." [...] Abbatiello also criticized Sony for not researching the possibility that the song might have had been previously released before releasing it.|$|E
500|$|During {{the whole}} {{production}} {{for the first}} season of Hannah Montana, Cyrus commented that [...] "right now we're just all really focused on making Hannah Montana the show {{as good as it}} can be, <b>but</b> <b>hopefully</b> in the future there may be a Hannah Montana soundtrack [...] a Miley Cyrus album." [...] The series itself premiered through the Disney Channel on March 24, 2006, and became an immediate commercial success; with 5.4 million viewers, the pilot episode earned the channel the highest ratings in its history at the time. The following month, it was reported that an accompanying soundtrack and Cyrus' debut studio album had both begun production, the latter of which was scheduled to be released in early 2007. The first soundtrack Hannah Montana (2006) debuted at number one with first-week sales of 286,000 copies, becoming the first television soundtrack to debut in the peak position of the chart.|$|E

500|$|Cresswell {{admitted}} {{he had not}} made the impact {{he had hoped to}} in the York first team, but ahead of 1998–99 said [...] "I've had some stick from a small number of fans, <b>but</b> <b>hopefully</b> I can prove them wrong. I will prove them wrong. This a big season for me. I want to do it for York City. I want to do it for myself." [...] After a positive start to the season, Cresswell attracted attention from other clubs, with a number of scouts attending matches to watch him play. Manager Alan Little claimed some clubs were making illegal approaches for the player, and that this was having a detrimental effect on his performances. Preston North End manager David Moyes claimed his club had a bid of more than £500,000 for Cresswell rejected, while York chairman Douglas Craig rejected this, saying a formal offer had not been received from any club. He was York's top scorer in 1998–99 with 19 goals from 42 appearances.|$|E
500|$|Due to its low budget, Becoming Jane {{was filmed}} on a [...] "tight" [...] {{schedule}} of eight weeks from March to May 2006. Jarrold observed however that because Ecosse {{was not a}} film studio, he had more creative freedom. Bernstein stated of filming, [...] "We recreated a world that Jane Austen lovers can recognise and associate with. <b>But</b> <b>hopefully</b> we can also take them into areas and places like the boxing club, the cricket game and the fair that do not feature in Jane Austen's fiction. They are sort of seedy and dangerous areas that are not normally associated with Austen." [...] Jarrold found filming [...] "very difficult. We {{had to make it}} work in the locations that we had as efficiently as possible." [...] Filming outdoors was often so cold that Hathaway turned blue and had difficulty saying her lines; Automated Dialogue Replacement in post-production helped correct this by re-dubbing her lines.|$|E
500|$|From May 2007 onwards, the {{character}} was portrayed as increasingly emotionally unstable, having had [...] "her whole world crash down around her", following storylines including {{the death of}} her husband, and her son's request to be taken into foster care. As this emotional instability continued and worsened with the abrupt ending of another relationship, {{the character}} was seen to develop full blown alcoholism. Series producer Diana Kyle said of the storyline: [...] "It's important we cover topics that are relevant today. Every day, people in the medical profession deal with patients who have drink or drug problems. Plus, {{the fact that some of}} the Holby staff are also suffering with these addictions is very pertinent to hospitals in real life." [...] Speaking of Kyla's struggle to deal with her addiction, she added: [...] "She'll work so hard to get her life together. She has a long way to go, <b>but</b> <b>hopefully</b> there's a light at the end of the tunnel..." ...|$|E

500|$|Mullally later stated he did {{not know}} he was auditioning for a recast, he also stated that he wasn't sure if he could be {{successful}} in the role to start with. He also watched hours of footage of previous episodes {{to get an idea of}} how to portray Declan, then making a statement to Declan fans reading: [...] "I'm sure that initially people will be quite confronted by a new face with the same character name – I'm not fooling myself about that. <b>But</b> <b>hopefully</b> people will come to accept it." [...] Mullally has compared the two versions of Declan saying [...] "One of the writers said to me in a meeting the other day that the changeover between James and me can be best described as James playing Declan as very strong, macho. He liked to get into things and was very proactive. [...] "The new Declan is more grown up, quite mature and savvy. He thinks with his head and knows what he wants and doesn't have to use brute force to get it." [...] During Rebecca's vision, Thomas Smith portrayed a six-year-old Declan.|$|E
500|$|The episode [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I." [...] {{introduces}} the Kree alien {{race to the}} MCU, members of which {{play a significant role}} in Guardians of the Galaxy. This begins a storyline that recurs throughout the series, and introduces Inhumans to the MCU, with Jed Whedon saying that it was something [...] "in the works" [...] for a long time, as Marvel Studios had plans for an Inhumans film, and this would be [...] "one of the first instances where we get to start planting the seeds on the show before the film." [...] The third season {{introduces the}} concept of the Secret Warriors, with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name, while also retconning the history of Hydra in the MCU, tying it into the Inhumans storyline. Gregg noted in January 2016 that the [...] "writer and director [...] will have free rein to do what they want to do with the Inhumans, <b>but</b> <b>hopefully</b> there'll be some way that our Inhumans connect to that." [...] When the film was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, Whedon noted that the series had [...] "a little more freedom" [...] and were [...] "able to do a little bit more" [...] with the species going into the fourth season, including the potential of introducing some of the [...] "classic" [...] Inhumans. Marvel's Inhumans, a television series centered on Black Bolt and other members of the Inhuman Royal Family, was announced in November 2016 to air on ABC in September 2017. It is not intended to be a spin-off of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

Kinsella has commented, [...] "It is nice to be compared because they were great [...] <b>but,</b> <b>hopefully,</b> [...] and I will bring our own characters to light and show what we can do. We have so much in common and we balance each other out – when she's crazy I'll calm her down and vice-versa.
