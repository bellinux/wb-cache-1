5|$|ABC {{regulations}} {{permit a}} bar owner or employee {{to give away}} a free drink {{as long as it}} is not advertised. Businesses may issue free or complimentary drink coupons (up to one per day per patron). Hotel and motel licensees may also give guests complimentary <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> on special occasions. Licensed establishments are permitted to institute dress codes, cover charges, and minimum age restrictions. Liquor stores are allowed to conduct tastings of beer, wine, and spirits. Bars, restaurants, state concessionaires (e.g. PNC Bank Arts Center), and non-profit organizations with a special permit can host both tastings and tasting dinners, the latter of which permits larger sample sizes.|$|E

The claret red theme of previous incarnations of the restaurant has been maintained, and was coupled in the design with leather and polished metalwork. The layout includes a chef's table for six people which overlooks the kitchen.

5|$|A {{large number}} of men were hired for the building's construction, and local workers were chosen over non-locals. During the construction, many of the workers lived in tents beside their worksite, and cooked meals and stayed there when not working. The {{cornerstone}} was laid on June 15, 1888; beneath it was laid several <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> {{a copy of a}} St. Helena Star and San Francisco newspapers, and foreign and rare coins. The building, called the Bourn & Wise Wine Cellar, was completed around June 1889, along with a distillery north of the building and a superintendent's house to the south. In September of that year Everett Wise became too ill to work and sold his share in the winery to Bourn, who between that time and 1890 named the winery Greystone Cellars.|$|E
5|$|The role {{of women}} in the Fasci siciliani was substantial, but is {{regularly}} overlooked in historical accounts. Women were often at the forefront of demonstrations and strikes, speaking in public meetings and conferences. During municipal elections they made sure that men were going to vote (women did {{not have the right to}} vote at the time). They patrolled the taverns to prevent the men from betraying the duty of militancy with <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine.</b> They also took care of many organizational aspects and were particularly active in proselytizing for the movement, decorating the stage of the rallies, preparing ceremonies such as the inauguration opening of the flag of the Fasci, and welcoming the leaders who came to the towns with flowers.|$|E
5|$|Although List {{wanted to}} become an artist and scholar, he reluctantly agreed to his father's insistence that he enter the family's leather goods business. During his leisure time he devoted himself to writing and {{sketching}} as well as rambling, riding, or rowing in the countryside, becoming both {{a member of the}} Viennese rowing club Donauhort and the secretary of the Austrian Alpine Association (Österreichischer Alpenverein). He was involved in both solitary and group expeditions into the Austrian Alps, and it was on one of the latter journeys that he left his mountaineering group to spend Midsummer night alone atop the Geiselberg hillfort. On 24 June 1875 he and four friends rowed down the Danube before camping for the night {{at the site of the}} ancient Roman fortification of Carnuntum to commemorate the 1500th anniversary of the Battle of Carnuntum, in which Germanic tribes defeated the Roman Army. List later claimed that while his friends caroused, he celebrated the event with a fire and by burying eight <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> in the shape of a swastika beneath the arch of the monument's Pagan Gate.|$|E

25|$|There {{was a brief}} {{revival in}} the economy during the {{presidency}} of Juan Perón but the economy declined soon again under the military dictatorship of the 1960s and 1970s. During this time the wine industry was sustained by the domestic consumption of cheap vino de mesa. By the early 1970s, average consumption was nearly 24 gallons (90 liters or around 120 standard 750 milliliter wine <b>bottles)</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> a year, significantly more than many other countries including the United Kingdom and United States which averaged less than a gallon (3 liters) a person during the same period.|$|E

25|$|Mobutu was infamous for embezzling the {{equivalent}} of billions of US dollars from his country. According to the most conservative estimates, he stole US$4–5billion from his country, and some sources put the figure as high as US$15billion. According to Mobutu's ex-son-in-law, Pierre Janssen—the ex-husband of Mobutu's daughter Yaki—Mobutu had no concern {{for the cost of}} the expensive gifts he gave away to his cronies. Janssen married Yaki in a lavish ceremony that included three orchestras, a US$65,000 wedding cake and a giant fireworks display. Yaki wore a US$70,000 wedding gown and US$3million worth of jewels. Janssen wrote a book describing Mobutu's daily routine—which included several daily <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> retainers flown in from overseas and lavish meals.|$|E
25|$|When the French revolutionary forces {{occupied}} Maastricht in 1794, {{the carefully}} hidden fossil was uncovered, after a reward, it is said, of 600 <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> and transported to Paris. After {{it had been}} earlier interpreted as a fish, a crocodile, and a sperm whale, the first to understand its lizard affinities was the Dutch scientist Adriaan Gilles Camper in 1799. In 1808, Georges Cuvier confirmed this conclusion, although le Grand Animal fossile de Maëstricht was not actually named Mosasaurus ('Meuse reptile') until 1822 and not given its full species name, Mosasaurus hoffmannii, until 1829. Several sets of mosasaur remains, that had been discovered earlier at Maastricht but were not identified as mosasaurs until the 19th century, have been {{on display in the}} Teylers Museum, Haarlem, procured from 1790.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, it expanded, {{and built}} a second plant at Elton, Cheshire, {{creating}} over 550 new jobs. It produces 20 percent of the UK's glass container requirements and provides a glass packaging, filling and distribution service for the drinks industry. The facilities at the plant include a beverage filling hall, warehousing, two glass melting furnaces and 13 production lines. The capacity of the second plant is currently 1.2 billion units, with production capacity of both plants estimated to be 2.4 billion units in 2008. The plant has five lines capable of bottling a total of 400 <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> or 1,000 bottles of beer a minute. Having manufacturing and bottling on the same site can reduce costs and keep prices competitive. By offering bottling services, there {{is the potential for}} glass makers to win more business as an overflow plant in times of high demand, and it is as a contract packing operation that the greatest benefits from bottling lines are likely to be had. However, the plant was constructed without the correct planning permission, and on 8 April 2009, the High Court ruled that it should be demolished.|$|E
25|$|Following the Fall of the Roman Empire, {{appreciation}} for aged wine was virtually non-existent. Most of the wines produced in northern Europe were light bodied, pale {{in color and}} with low alcohol. These wines {{did not have much}} aging potential and barely lasted a few months before they rapidly deteriorated into vinegar. The older a wine got the cheaper its price became as merchants eagerly sought to rid themselves of aging wine. By the 16th century, sweeter and more alcoholic wines (like Malmsey and Sack) were being made in the Mediterranean and gaining attention for their aging ability. Similarly, Riesling from Germany with its combination of acidity and sugar were also demonstrating their ability to age. In the 17th century, two innovations occurred that radically changed the wine industry's view on aging. One was the development of the cork and bottle which allowed producers to package and store wine in a virtually air-tight environment. The second was the growing popularity of fortifying wines such as Port, Madeira and Sherries. The added alcohol was found to act as a preservative, allowing wines to survive long sea voyages to England, The Americas and the East Indies. The English, in particular, were growing in their appreciation of aged wines like Port and Claret from Bordeaux. Demand for matured wines had a pronounced effect on the wine trade. For producers, the cost and space of storing barrels or <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> was prohibitive so a merchant class evolved with warehouses and the finances to facilitate aging wines {{for a longer period of}} time. In regions like Bordeaux, Oporto and Burgundy, this situation dramatically increased the balance of power towards the merchant classes.|$|E
