50|$|The Series II {{version was}} {{introduced}} in June 1996 and carried through in its original form to August 1997, during which time 280 examples were produced. With HSV's introduction of the VT sedan range in September 1997, continued production of the VS Maloo thereafter was curiously referred to as VS II at VT Maloo, whereby a further 388 examples were produced through to December 1998. These later models included a special run of ten HSV 10th Anniversary Edition Maloo utes featuring an exclusive Anniversary <b>Bronze</b> <b>paint</b> colour.|$|E
50|$|Dominating the {{north-western}} {{end wall}} of the foyer is a large false Gothic window, made from plaster with panels of reflective <b>bronze</b> <b>paint</b> imitating glass. This feature is repeated on the opposite wall, with the lower portion serving as the doorway {{at the top of}} the grand marble staircase. Decorative friezes run across the north-western end wall at above door height, and two small lanterns are attached on either side of its Gothic window. All other wall surfaces throughout the grand foyer are scored and painted to resemble travertine block work.|$|E

50|$|Notorious {{for being}} 'the village with the unpronounceable name', Uffam is {{believed}} to mean 'the place of owls', although there are other derivations. Sadly, {{the destruction of the}} surrounding countryside for open-cast mining, and the disappearance of farm buildings and stone barns means that owls are seldom heard or seen. So the people of Ulgham have their own owls and almost every house has one. There are owls of china, glass, wood, <b>bronze,</b> <b>paint</b> and needlework, stone owls in gardens and an owl is incorporated into the sign of the village pub - The Forge.|$|E
5000|$|For the 1975 Motor Show, {{a limited}} edition Hillman Hunter Topaz was produced. This was {{largely based on}} the Hunter Super and {{equipped}} with overdrive, radio, vinyl roof, Rostyle wheels and a special half cloth upholstery as standard. This car was only available in a unique metallic <b>bronze</b> <b>paint</b> finish. The price was {{less than that of}} the standard Hunter Super when fitted with the optional overdrive.A Hillman Break de Chasse was sold in French-speaking markets, based on the Minx specification. (Also offered was a similar Sunbeam Break de Chasse; [...] "break" [...] being a French term for an estate, and the phrase break de chasse translating roughly as shooting-brake.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Miervaldis Polis (born 23 July 1948, Riga, Latvia) is a Latvian {{painter and}} {{performance}} artist. In the early 1970s, he and Līga Purmale, {{his wife at}} the time, started a new trend of photorealism in Latvian painting. In the early 1980s, he turned to performance art, {{one of his most}} notable performances being The Bronze Man, wherein he roamed the streets of Riga, Latvia, in a bronze suit, covered from head to toe in <b>bronze</b> <b>paint.</b> In the 1990s, after Latvia regained independence, Polis became known as the Latvian [...] "court painter," [...] receiving commissions to paint the portraits of the Latvian elite, including former presidents Guntis Ulmanis and Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Lichtenstein created <b>painted</b> <b>bronze</b> sculptures {{that were}} based on his earlier paintings. Expressionist Head was among the {{earliest}} of these sculputural adaptations. The sculpture is composed of <b>painted</b> and patinated <b>bronze</b> with <b>painted</b> wooden base.|$|R
5000|$|A {{series of}} {{three-dimensional}} Trompe-l'œil works includes objects cast into <b>bronze,</b> <b>painted</b> {{to give the}} appearance of the original object. Possibly his most revered works, these include bronze sculptures of plastic rubbish bags, see [...] "Bag" [...] (2000). Other sculptures include [...] "Nomad" [...] (2002), a bronze cast of a sleeping bag, and Box (2002), which resembles a cardboard box. Turk is perhaps the leading exponent of the <b>painted</b> <b>bronze,</b> and has cast objects from spent matches to worn paving slabs to discarded vehicle exhaust pipes.|$|R
50|$|El Transparente is a Baroque altarpiece in the {{ambulatory}} of the Cathedral of Toledo. Its name {{refers to}} the unique illumination provided by a large skylight cut very high up into the thick wall across the ambulatory, and another hole cut {{into the back of}} the altarpiece itself to allow shafts of sunlight to strike the tabernacle. This lower hole also allows persons in the ambulatory to see through the altarpiece to the tabernacle, as if were transparent, so to speak. It was created in 1729-1732 by Narciso Tomé and his four sons (two architects, one painter and one sculptor). The use of light and of mixed materials (marble, <b>bronze,</b> <b>paint,</b> stucco) may reflect the influence of Bernini's Cathedra Petri in St Peter's Basilica, Rome.|$|E
5000|$|Similar {{to other}} Space Age show cars, the Golden Rocket was heavily {{influenced}} by the themes of aviation and space exploration. Its distinctive sleek aerodynamic body was made entirely from lightweight fiberglass and finished in metallic <b>bronze</b> <b>paint.</b> Bullet-shaped chrome pieces resembling Dagmar bumpers were integrated into the front fenders in place of headlights {{as well as the}} sweeping rear fenders, giving the car an overall rocket-like appearance. Other notable features include a swept-back wrap-around windshield, which had already become a common design element by the mid-1950s, less prominent tailfins by contemporary standards and a split-window fastback roof design presaging the 1963 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray. It rode on unique [...] "dotted-line" [...] whitewall tires. A later photo taken inside the GM Design Center in Warren, Michigan shows the car sporting a blue paint scheme.|$|E

50|$|Leighton cast a small <b>bronze</b> <b>painted</b> plaster {{sculpture}} of Andromeda as a study before commencing {{work on the}} painting. The statuette was naked but Leighton placed wet materials over it to achieve the effect he wanted to reproduce in his work. A later artwork, Perseus on Pegasus Hastening to the Rescue of Andromeda, completed four years later, portrayed the same story.|$|R
50|$|In December 2006, {{the artist}} Antonio Lopez Reche {{was given a}} grant by the Tower Hamlets Council Art Department to {{reproduce}} the 'Woman and Fish' statue, following Dobson’s original design. However, unlike the original statue the reproduction was cast in <b>bronze,</b> <b>painted</b> and contains no fountain.

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 2209 on 28. 02. 2017 by CS (TIS) The research {{project is to}} {{develop an understanding of}} the use of automatism in the practice of art derived from an interrelationship between the material process of art and critical text. As these practices converge in their vocabularies of the psychic and the somatic, they formulate a discourse of interpretation. The critical textual inquiry has identified an expanded language of interpretation for automatism within the vocabularies of three particular areas of investigation in, I. Psychoanalysis, 2. Phenomenology and certain currents of thought in Existentialism, and in 3. The theory and criticism of art. I have laid down an account of the field of research and my reading of it through six constituent writers: Freud, Ehrenzweig, Merleau-Ponty, Breton, Bataille and Rosenberg, determined from the artist-practitioner's perspective to be central contributors to an understanding of automatism. Four key terms have recurred in the material which I have identified in the research process as phenomena of automatist art practice; trauma, repetition, excess and gesture. As thinking continues in a contextualisation of art and critical theory they have provided further links to the theoretical language of current psychoanalysis and criticism by writers including: Agamben, Barthes, Foster, Krauss, Lacan and Lyotard. The focus of the practical inquiry rests upon an exploration of the communion between the unconscious mind and the body in automatism, derived from a studio practice with emphasis on a modelling and casting process. It is developed through the four key terms used as bridges in a critical exchange between the material practice and textual theory including original automatic writing. The theorising function of the art practice has been to initiate the four phases of the process of automatism as phenomena to be re-theorised through the four key terms as they are exemplified by a reflexive studio practice of automatist methodology in action. The body of art presented for examination selects works in series completed from 1996 - 2006, in the following materials: <b>bronze,</b> <b>paint,</b> plaster, laser print and wax...|$|E
