25|$|The {{electronegative}} element {{need not}} be directly bonded to the acidic hydrogen to increase its acidity. An electronegative atom can pull electron density out of an acidic bond through the inductive effect. The electron-withdrawing ability diminishes quickly as the electronegative atom {{moves away from the}} acidic bond. The effect is illustrated by the following series of halogenated butanoic acids. Chlorine is more electronegative than bromine and therefore has a stronger effect. The hydrogen atom bonded to the oxygen is the acidic hydrogen. <b>Butanoic</b> <b>acid</b> is a carboxylic acid.|$|E
25|$|As the {{chlorine}} atom moves {{further away from}} the acidic O—H bond, its effect diminishes. When {{the chlorine}} atom is just one carbon removed from the carboxylic acid group, the acidity of the compound increases significantly compared to <b>butanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (a.k.a. butyric acid). However, when the chlorine atom is separated by several bonds, the effect is much smaller. Bromine is much more electronegative than either carbon or hydrogen, but not as electronegative as chlorine, so the pKa of 2-bromobutanoic acid is slightly greater than the pKa of 2-chlorobutanoic acid.|$|E

However, transfer mechanisms through dense NF and RO membranes are still not well understood for the organic solutes to eliminate, and rejection results could be disappointing.

Odorous gas samples were collected every two weeks using sorbent tubes and analyzed by the automated one-step thermal desorption-GC-MS-Olfactometry.

However, adsorbed organics could influence the chemical and physical properties of atmospheric mineral particles and alter {{their impact on the}} biosphere and climate. In this work, the heterogeneous uptake of a series of small organic acids on the swelling clay, Na-montmorillonite, was studied at 212 K as a function of relative humidity (RH), organic acid pressure and clay mass. A high vacuum chamber equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer and a transmission Fourier transform infrared spectrometer was used to detect the gas and condensed phases, respectively. Our results show that while the initial uptake efficiency was found to be independent of organic acid pressure, it increased linearly with increasing clay mass. Thus, the small masses studied allow access to the entire surface area of the clay sample with minimal effects due to surface saturation. Additionally, results from this study show that the initial uptake efficiency for <b>butanoic</b> (butyric) <b>acid</b> on the clay increases by an order of magnitude as the RH is raised from 0 % to 45 % RH at 212 K while the initial uptake efficiency of formic, acetic and propanoic (propionic) acids increases only slightly at higher humidities. However, the initial uptake efficiency decreases significantly in {{a short amount of time}} due to surface saturation effects. Thus, although the initial uptake efficiencies are appropriate for initial times, the fact that the uptake efficiency will decrease over time as the surface saturates should be considered in atmospheric models. Surface saturation results in sub-monolayer coverage of organic acid on montmorillonite under dry conditions and relevant organic acid pressures that increases with increasing humidity for all organic acids studied. Additionally, the presence of large organic acids may slightly enhance the water content of the clay above 45 % RH.

Earlier reports have shown that supplementation with cow urine attenuated the increased toxicity in rats intoxicated by carbon tetrachloride (Gururaja et al. 2009) and lindane (Nagda and Bhatt 2014). The results reveal that treatment with cow urine was effective in lowering the toxic effects of CPF. Thus, reduced levels of AChE indicate the effective neuroprotective efficacy of cow urine in the moderation of tissue damage. Matkovics et al. (1983) reported that AChE-inhibiting action of organophosphorus pesticides could be compensated by vitamin E. Furthermore, cow urine was found to be rich in various elements and compounds such as manganese, iron, silicon, calcium salts, minerals, lactose, chlorine, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphate, sodium, magnesium, citric, titric, succinic and carbolic acid, enzymes, creatinine, hormones, gold acids and vitamins A, B, C, D and E. The study by Krishnamurthi et al. (2004) showed that cow urine possesses antioxidant status of around 2.6  m mol, contributed mainly by volatile fatty acids (1500  mg/L) as revealed by the GC–MS studies. ABTS assay is an excellent tool for measuring the antioxidant capacity of hydrogen donating antioxidants. ABTS is a blue chromophore produced by the reaction between ABTS salt and potassium per-sulfate. As soon as cow urine was added to this pre-formed radical cation it reduced it to ABTS. In the literature, it has been observed that, ABTS reducing property is directly proportional to the amount of antioxidant activity. Therefore, the potent ABTS reduction observed in this assay might be due to the antioxidant compounds present in cow urine. Sachdev et al. (2012) revealed that cow urine contains volatile fatty acids such as acetic acid 2 propenyl ester, acetic acid methyl ester, 2, 2, 3,trichloro propionic <b>acid,</b> <b>butanoic</b> acid- 3 methyl, propyl ester, 1 H indol- 3 -acetate, acetic acid phenyl ester and quinoline that may act as an antioxidants. This has been confirmed by the estimation of thiobarbituric acid, ascorbic acid, DPPH radical scavenging activity and ABTS assay. Furthermore, gold acids protect the body against oxidative stress that insults the nervous system (Jain et al. 2010). The presence of fatty acids and other antioxidants might have caused the observed protective effects.|$|R
