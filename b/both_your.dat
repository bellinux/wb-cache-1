25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and <b>both</b> <b>your</b> property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E

On 20 November 2000, at the Old Bailey, the trial into her death opened, where Kouao and Manning were charged with child cruelty and murder. Kouao denied all charges, and Manning pleaded guilty to charges of cruelty and manslaughter. The judge described the people in Climbié's case as [...] "blindingly incompetent". In his diary, Manning described Climbié as Satan, and said that no matter how hard he hit her, she did not cry or show signs that she was hurt. On 12 January 2001, both were found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. The judge said to them, [...] "what Victoria endured was truly unimaginable. She died at <b>both</b> <b>your</b> hands, a lonely drawn out death". Kouao went to Durham prison and Manning went to Wakefield prison.|$|E

The campaign set up a [...] before the March 13 interview. Liberal bloggers praised the behind the scenes look at {{the campaign}} as innovative and creative. A posting on the Comedy Central show's blog read: [...] "This was a fascinating look {{behind the scenes of}} the show even for us, and a surprisingly cool thing for a Presidential candidate to do. Senator Dodd, we salute <b>both</b> <b>your</b> commitment to fiscal responsibility and your web-savvy." [...] After the visit Dodd campaigned in New Hampshire and Nevada finishing the month at a forums in Las Vegas and Washington, D.C.

500|$|Robert Nathan's 1966 romantic comedy, Juliet in Mantua, {{presents}} Rosaline as a {{fully developed}} character. [...] In this sequel, in which Romeo and Juliet did not die, the pair live {{ten years later}} in exile in Mantua. [...] After they are forgiven and return to Verona, they learn that Rosaline is now married to County Paris, and both couples must confront their disillusionment with their marriages. [...] Another play, After Juliet, written by Scottish playwright Sharman Macdonald, {{tells the story of}} Rosaline after Romeo dies. A main character in this play, she struggles with her loss and turns away the advances of Benvolio, who has fallen in love with her. Macdonald's daughter, Keira Knightley, played Rosaline in the play's 1999 premiere. The 2012 young adult novel [...] "When You Were Mine" [...] by Rebecca Serle sets Rosaline's story in a contemporary high school. Rosaline and Romeo (renamed Rob) have been best friends since childhood and are just beginning to fall in love when Rosaline's cousin, Juliet, moves back into town and sets her sights on Rob.

500|$|Gerstmann {{called the}} quality FMV [...] "a small victory {{in a larger}} conflict", saying the game had [...] "too many little {{problems}} to recommend it" [...] and that it [...] "simply doesn't play {{as well as the}} old 16-bit Strike games." [...] Sega Saturn Magazine called it a [...] "worthy addition" [...] to the series and also noted improvements to the Saturn version. GameFan said the game [...] "is everything you could wish for from a 32bit Strike" [...] and that [...] "it plays brilliantly, and exercises <b>both</b> <b>your</b> trigger finger and grey matter." [...] The magazine later reflected that the Saturn version was somewhat better but nevertheless very similar to the PlayStation original. It recommended the game to Strike fans but felt it would be an [...] "in at the deep end" [...] introduction for newcomers to the series. Edge summarised: [...] "this is a fairly well-engineered continuation of the four-year-old Strike series", which retains the gameplay of the original but updates the graphics to true 3D. GamePro felt the game might be too slow for fans of faster paced action games, but recommended it for players of previous instalments in the series. Allgame later felt: [...] "The series peaked with the release of Soviet Strike." ...|$|E
500|$|Nintendo Power {{praised the}} story {{and the number of}} lightsaber combos but criticized the game's {{easiness}} and hack-and-slash gameplay. It also praised the Wii version for its story and Force powers, but criticized the game's lightsaber controls and linear gameplay. GameSpot noticed visual glitches and problematic audio compression that detracted from the Wii version's [...] "mature and exciting" [...] story, adding that the reduced number of Force-manipulable objects helps mitigate the targeting problems experienced on other platforms. Referring to the Wii remote and nunchuck controls, GameSpot also speculated that The Force Unleashed is [...] "possibly the most waggle-heavy" [...] Wii game. Zero Punctuation criticized the Wii version's graphics and compared lightsaber combat to [...] "trying to follow an aerobics routine with <b>both</b> <b>your</b> arms tied to different windmills". The ability to upgrade Starkiller's abilities in the PS2 version, according to IGN, is not as [...] "robust" [...] as it should be, and the game's targeting system is sometimes frustrating. IGN said the PS2's real-time cutscene rendering made Starkiller seem emotionless, and that pre-rendered cutscenes would have been better. GameSpot found the DS version's plot interesting but the storytelling itself [...] "lackluster". While the DS version is easy, with Starkiller killing enemies [...] "like a hot knife through butter", GameSpot said the player's sense of power is not matched by a sense of freedom. GameSpot called the PSP version's camera [...] "unwieldy", but added that smaller and less cluttered environments make the targeting system less frustrating than on other platforms. The Wii version was a nominee for multiple Wii-specific awards from IGN in its 2008 video game awards, including Best Story and Best Voice Acting.|$|E
