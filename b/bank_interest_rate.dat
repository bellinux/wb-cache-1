For example, when the inflation rate exceeds its target, the rule recommends an increase in the interest rate.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of loan market competition on the <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> applied by euro area banks to loans and deposits during the 1994 - 2004 period, using a novel measure of competition called the Boone indicator. We find evidence that stronger competition implies significantly lower spreads between <b>bank</b> and market <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> for most loan market products, in line with expectations. Using an error correction model (ECM) approach to measure the effect of competition on the pass-through of market <b>rates</b> to <b>bank</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> we likewise find that banks tend to price their loans more {{in accordance with the}} market in countries where competitive pressures are stronger. Further, where loan market competition is stronger, we observe larger bank spreads (implying lower <b>bank</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates)</b> on current account and time deposits. This would suggest that the competitive pressure is heavier in the loan market than in the deposit markets, so that banks under competition compensate for their reduction in loan market income by lowering their deposit rates. We observe also that <b>bank</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in more competitive markets respond more strongly to changes in market <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> These findings have important monetary policy implications, as they suggest that measures to enhance competition in the European banking sector will tend to render the monetary policy transmission mechanism more effective. ...|$|R

Gyurcsány initiated a constructive {{motion of no confidence}} against himself on 21 March and nominated Minister for Development and economist Gordon Bajnai as his replacement. The socialist and liberal parties accepted him as the new prime minister with an interim government for one year from 14 April. Bajnai's premiership brought new austerity measures in Hungary. Thus, they may keep the deficit under 4% in 2009 and the 2010 Budget calculations assumed 3.8%. The inflation outturn was near 3% {{as a result of the}} crisis, but because of the increase in VAT, it averaged 5% in the second half of the year.

5000|$|Canada {{was one of}} {{the last}} industrialized nations to enter into a downturn. GDP growth was {{negative}} in Q1, but positive in Q2 and Q3 of 2008. The recession officially started in Q4. The almost 1-year delay of the start of the recession in Canada relative to the U.S. is largely explained by two factors. First, Canada has a strong banking sector not weighed-down by the same degree of consumer-related debt issues that existed in the United States. [...] The United States economy collapsed from within, while the Canadian economy was being hurt by its trade relationship with the United States. Second, commodity prices continued to rise through to June 2008, supporting a key component of the Canadian economy and delaying the start of recession. In early December 2008, the Bank of Canada, in announcing that it was lowering its central <b>bank</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> to the lowest level since 1958, also declared that Canada's economy was entering in recession. [...] The Bank of Canada has since announced that it has two consecutive months of GDP decline (Oct -0.1% & Nov -0.7%). The country's unemployment rate could rise to 7.5% in the next two years, according to the latest OECD report.|$|E

We used panel data to the bank-level variables and we applied the methodology proposed by Chamberlain (1982) for models with non-observed individual characteristics. The main conclusions are: (i) default risk, interest-rate risk and administrative costs have positive effects over the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> margin; (ii) beside this factors, there are other characteristics that {{have a significant impact}} over the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> margin, e. g. the liquidity level of the bank, the market-share and the banking services revenues; and (iii) the Chamberlain's methodology shows considerable efficiency gains relative to the 'fixed-effects' estimation in this sample. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the link}} between interest rate risk faced by financial intermediaries in the G- 10 countries, their balance sheet composition and national bank regulation. The regulatory authorities both in the US and in Europe increasingly emphasise the issue of <b>bank</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> exposure. The importance of this topic is also reasserted by recent developments in the monetary environment. The thesis offers three major contributions to the area. First, it empirically investigates the interest rate risk exposure of financial intermediaries across a large international data sample over the 1997 to 2009 time period. The results verify the importance of interest rate exposure {{for the majority of}} analysed institutions, with statistical inferences being robust to the choice of interest rate proxy, time period, and the adopted econometric methodology. Second, this research examines the underlying determinants of <b>bank</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk. Both company and market specific information is considered in the analysis. The findings suggest that national regulatory and supervisory characteristics, and notably international diversity among these provisions, are as important as firm-level accounting variables in explaining the interest rate exposures of individual banks. Finally, this work empirically addresses the impact of securitization on <b>bank</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk. In particular, the research questions whether securitization is conducive to the optimal hedging of <b>bank</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk, or is merely a funding source enabling these companies to pursue more profitable but riskier projects. The reported results imply that banks resorting to asset securitization do not, on average, achieve an unambiguous reduction in their exposure to the term structure developments.

40|$|The celebrated Taylor rule {{provides}} a simple formula {{that aims to}} capture how the central <b>bank</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is adjusted as a linear function of inflation and output gap. However, the rule does not take explicitly into account the zero lower bound on the interest rate.

In this work, Taylor-like rules for central bank interest rates bounded below by zero are derived rigorously using a multi-parametric model predictive control framework. This framework is used to derive rules with or without inertia. The proposed approach is illustrated through simulations. Application of the approach to US economy data demonstrates its relevance and provides insight into the objectives underlying central <b>bank</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> decisions.

We adopted the semi parametric approach developed by DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996), originally constructed to get the effects of minimum wage in wage inequality. We consider two more explanatory factors: i) the default rate; ii) other individual characteristics, like bank size and bank liquidity. We used the kernel method with a careful reweight choice to estimate the counterfactual <b>bank</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> density associated with each one of the explanatory factors. This procedure allows us to compare the relative weight each factor has on the density of interest rates and yields a visually clear representation of precisely where in the distribution the various factors have greatest impact. We used data from Cosif and from information reported by banks to the Central Bank and we restricted the estimation for two categories of bank loans: Working Capital and Personal Overdrafts. The results show negligible effects of the variation of the default rate and important effects of reserve requirement rates on banking loan rates. ...|$|E
