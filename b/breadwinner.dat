Amberson, a brilliant student in the fields of science, became an alcoholic after losing control of his company, and was physically abusive toward his family.

40|$|In a {{significant}} number of societies worldwide, the primary role of men is to serve as <b>breadwinners</b> in their households. However, in Nigeria, since the mid- 1980 s there has been a steady {{rise in the number of}} women <b>breadwinners</b> in many households. In spite of this, not enough studies have been conducted on this emerging phenomenon. Using feminist and political economy theories as explanatory tools, the study examined women <b>breadwinners</b> in Nigeria using Ile-Ife of Southwestern Nigeria as a case study. Both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection were utilized to explore the circumstances leading to the rise of women <b>breadwinners</b> in the study area. The study showed that the increase in the number of women <b>breadwinners</b> was as a result of Nigeria’s economic downturn, husbands’ uncaring attitude and the need of women to properly bring up their children in line with societal norms. Breadwinning role was found to have impacted negatively on the women, a situation traceable to their socio-economic profiles such as low educational status, occupation and income which have made sustenance of the family very difficult. The paper concludes that the phenomenon of women <b>breadwinners</b> and the problems they encounter are due to economic recession and patriarchy in Nigeria. Governmental interventions that would primarily contribute to well-being of women <b>breadwinners</b> were suggested as a long term measure to ameliorate their peculiar problems...|$|R

40|$|In South African society, {{many women}} have {{overcome}} traditional notions of gender by becoming primary <b>breadwinners</b> {{in their homes and}} providing primary financial support for their families. Employing a Phenomenological viewpoint, this paper contextualises the individual lived experiences of South African female <b>breadwinners,</b> utilising data collected from ten female <b>breadwinners</b> from the Mpumalanga and Gauteng provinces respectively using in-depth, semi structured interviews. Taking into consideration their intersectional experiences of gender, race, as well as cultural, traditional and patriarchal societal pressures, the study represents voices that have for a long time been silenced and marginalised, to understand how these women make meaning of and negotiate their roles as <b>breadwinners.</b> The findings of this study expose the perpetual archaic divisions and discriminations of gender within society, which continue to hide behind constructions of reform advocating equality among the sexes...|$|R

5|$|The Gallaher {{couple and}} their six {{children}} arrived in Auckland after a three-month voyage, {{and from there}} sailed to Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty, before their final voyage to Katikati. On arrival they found the settlement scheme was not what they had envisaged or been promised: the land allocated to the family required enormous work to be broken in before being suitable for farming, there was no easy access to water, and the settlement was very hilly. It had been hoped that James would be employed as the agent for the Donegal Knitting Company in New Zealand, {{which was to be}} established by Lord George Augusta Hill. But Hill died unexpectedly and his successor did not support the initiative. As the family's poor quality land was insufficient to make a living, the children's mother Maria soon became the chief <b>breadwinner</b> after she obtained a position teaching for £2 a week at the new No. 2 School.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} {{has focused on}} motives to explain remittance behavior. But as nonanonymous transfers, remittances are apt {{to be influenced by}} giving norms as well. We formulate an empirical specification that takes account of remittance motives involving worker-household pairs. We find that altruism dominates the exchange motive among overseas workers who are likely to be the primary <b>breadwinners</b> of their recipient households. We also find that in the subsample in which overseas workers are likely to be secondary <b>breadwinners,</b> (a) household labor income is an endogenous explanatory variable, and (b) the error covariance of the household income and remittance selection equations is positive. A possible reason for (a) is that secondary <b>breadwinners</b> use household income as an imperfect signal of opportunity cost or to detect unobserved effort, i. e., moral hazard, in generating income. As for (b), we surmise that it indicates the presence of incentive-compatible mechanisms against moral hazard. On giving norms, we find that, in samples that include overseas workers who are secondary <b>breadwinners,</b> remittance amounts are afflicted with negative selectivity. We present evidence that this is consistent with Filipino giving practices in which everyone gives but in modest amounts. remittances, remittance motives, giving norms...|$|R
25|$|Herbert began researching Dune in 1959.

At first, though, WMA found Lee few opportunities, and Lee remained unemployed for six years. During this time, he was a full-time house-husband, while his wife Jane Lin, a molecular biologist, was the sole <b>breadwinner</b> for the family of four. This arrangement put enormous pressure on the couple, but with Lin's support and understanding, Lee did not abandon his career in film but continued to generate new ideas from movies and performances. He also wrote several screenplays during this time.|$|E
25|$|Child labour {{played an}} {{important}} role in the Industrial Revolution from its outset, often brought about by economic hardship. The children of the poor were expected to contribute to their family income. In 19th-century Great Britain, one-third of poor families were without a <b>breadwinner,</b> as a result of death or abandonment, obliging many children to work from a young age. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered cotton mills were described as children. A high number of children also worked as prostitutes. The author Charles Dickens worked at the age of 12 in a blacking factory, with his family in debtor's prison.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine how}} male breadwinning and {{fatherhood}} relate to men’s overwork and underwork in western Europe. Male <b>breadwinners</b> {{should be less}} likely to experience overwork than other men, particularly when they have children, if specialising in paid work suits them. However, multinomial logistic regression analysis of the European Social Survey data from 2010 (n = 4662) challenges this position: male <b>breadwinners,</b> with and without children, want to work fewer than their actual hours, making visible one of the downsides of specialisation. Male <b>breadwinners</b> wanting to work fewer hours is specifically related to the job interfering with family life, as revealed by a comparison of the average marginal effects of variables across models. Work–life interference has an effect over and beyond the separate effects of work characteristics and family structure, showing the salience of the way work and life articulate.

25|$|The NWP's {{agenda was}} at times opposed by working class women {{and by the}} labor unions that {{represented}} working class men who feared low-wage women workers would lower the overall pay scale and demean {{the role of the}} male <b>breadwinner.</b> Eleanor Roosevelt, an ally of the unions, generally opposed the NWP policies because she believed women needed protective legislation, not equality. However, the National Woman's Party found protective legislation to relegate women to a lower class, and aimed their work on the ERA and other legislation to combat this second class citizenship status. The NWP argued that protective labor legislation would continue to depress women's wages and prevent women from gaining access to all types of work and parts of society.|$|E
25|$|Boole {{was born}} in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England, the son of John Boole Sr (1779–1848), a {{shoemaker}} and Mary Ann Joyce.

William Brooke, a bookseller in Lincoln, may have helped him with Latin, which he may also have learned {{at the school of}} Thomas Bainbridge. He was self-taught in modern languages. In fact, when a local newspaper printed his translation of a Latin poem, a scholar accused him of plagiarism under the pretense that he was not capable of such achievements.
