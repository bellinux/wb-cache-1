Sometimes he also is shown as a serpent, the form he returns to {{at the end of}} the creative cycle, and also occasionally as a mongoose, lion, <b>bull,</b> <b>lizard,</b> or ape.|$|E
50|$|A bird checklist, {{available}} at the visitor center, listed of over 100 species {{that can be found}} in the area. These include notable species such as hawks, golden eagles, killdeer, Gambel's quail, great blue herons, and red-shafted flickers. Many mammals can also be seen in the park, such as gray foxes, bobcats, badgers, prairie dogs, desert cottontails, jackrabbits, and porcupines. Reptiles found in the area include the Hopi rattlesnake, western king rattlesnake, horned lizards, common collared <b>lizards,</b> <b>bull</b> snakes, and desert spiny lizards.|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. The {{grassland}} biome of South Africa harbours rich ecosystem diversity. Some of {{the distinctive}} features of grassland biodiversity in South Africa include globally significant centres of plant endemism, {{half of the}} country's endemic mammal species, {{a third of its}} endangered butterfly species and 10 of 14 of its globally threatened bird species. Grassland {{is one of the most}} inadequately maintained biomes in Southern Africa because 23 % is under cultivation, 60 % is irreversibly transformed and most of the remaining natural area is used as rangeland for livestock. Only 2 % of the grassland biome is currently protected. Grasslands provide essential ecosystem services for economic development, but this biome also supports a large human population whose resource demands have serious environmental implications that threaten the grasslandsâ€˜ biodiversity. Urbanisation is possibly one of the major immediate threats to the grassland ecology in South Africa. This is also the case in the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site (COHWHS) and adjacent areas. New housing complexes and informal housing are encroaching on the COHWHS. Indigenous fauna and flora are being affected by ecologically insensitive urban development. This poses a major threat to the fauna of this region including the insects that occur in grassland habitats. The insects play a vital role as pollinators in grassland habitats and form an essential food source to a range of predators, including grass owls, shrews, <b>bull</b> frogs, <b>lizards</b> and bats. In order to conserve the insects and therefore the food web of which they form part, it is necessary to understand the diversity of the insects in the grassland in the dolomitic areas. The COHWHS is a world renowned heritage site devoted to the origin of humankind and is characterised by dolomitic caves. These caves are also the home of a large population of bats consisting of several species. The negative impact on the grasslands in the COHWHS and surroundings pose a threat to the survival of these bat populations if the food source they depend on is negatively affected. For this reason it is important to determine which flying nocturnal insect species are available in the grasslands surrounding bat roosts in the COHWHS and surroundings. 3 The choice of location for the primary trap site was made on the basis of its proximity to known bat roosts and the fact that it is situated in a nature reserve that, although the river is polluted, contains an otherwise relatively unspoilt grassland habitat. Sampling took place over a period of 14 months during which fluctuations in the insect population was observed. The fluctuations can be ascribed to seasonal climate changes and the three veld fires that occurred during this period. This fluctuation was most evident in the representatives of the Orders Lepidoptera and Coleoptera sampled...|$|R
