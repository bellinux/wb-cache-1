40|$|Abstract — To make {{a direct}} {{comparison}} of the sensitivity between a spiral and a twin slot antenna coupled HEB <b>mixer,</b> we designed <b>both</b> types of <b>mixers</b> and fabricated them in a single processing run and on the same wafer. <b>Both</b> <b>mixers</b> have similar dimensions of NbN bridges (1. 5 - 2 pm x 0. 2 pm). At 1. 6 THz we obtained a nearly identical receiver noise temperature from <b>both</b> <b>mixers</b> (only 5 % difference), which is in a good agreement with the simulation based on semi analytical models for both antennas. In addition, by using a bandpass filter to reduce the direct detection effect and lowering the bath temperature to 2. 4 K, we measured the lowest receiver noise temperature of 700 K at 1. 63 THz using the twin-slot antenna mixer.

The mixer consists of two cascaded passive mixers with an interstage second order filter suppressing harmonics while providing some 10 dB of voltage gain at the LO frequency.

40|$|The {{flexibility}} of distillers grains {{has made it}} a major substitute for corn in beef feed rations. However, producers are having issues with feeding wet distillers grains.

Horizontal and vertical mixers were tested at mix times of 3, 5, and 7 min mixing a beef finishing ration containing wet distillers grains.

40|$|The {{theory of}} mixer-ejectors for noise {{suppression}} {{is illustrated in}} this cartoon. Since jet noise SPL scales as velocity to the eighth power and diameter squared, increasing the jet diameter while lowering its velocity and keeping thrust constant decreases the noise. However, in supersonic craft, the drag penalty for increasing diameter at supersonic cruise makes this option very expensive. One {{would like to have}} a large engine during takeoff which could be shrunk during cruise. The retractable ejector is such an expandable engine. If the mixer flow can be expanded to the size of the ejector exit, the noise generated downstream of the ejector will be much less than the small diameter mixer nozzle alone. Of course, this also requires that the noise created in expanding the flow to fill the ejector be absorbed by a liner in the ejector walls so that none of this noise is heard. Since this mixing of internal hot gas and external cold air must take place in as short a distance as possible, the <b>mixer</b> <b>must</b> be very effective and therefore probably much noisier than a simple nozzle...|$|R

While capital costs of MBRs have become fairly competitive with conventional treatment systems, the operating costs, specifically as related to energy requirements, require additional focus. The key opportunities for energy reduction center on aeration both in the biological basins and the membrane tanks; however, all energy related elements should be considered. In order to provide the most cost effective and energy efficient system, it is important to explore opportunities related to design, operations, and equipment.
