25|$|Dr. Satyajit Chavan is {{the head}} doctor at a civil {{hospital}} in Delhi. Satyajit is well regarded and respected, but he has terrible bedside manners and is generally rude to everyone.

The overall goal of triage, in this system, is to both determine if a patient is appropriate for a given level of care and to ensure that hospital resources are utilized effectively.|$|E
