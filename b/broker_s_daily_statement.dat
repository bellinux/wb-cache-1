Ten families of 0 -to- 4 -year-old children with severe disabilities participated in semi-structured interviews and completed questionnaires concerning their child 2 ̆ 7 s and the family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>daily</b> life pattern. Relationships between daily life patterns were classified into three types: 2 ̆ 2 The family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>daily</b> life pattern has {{to adapt to the}} child 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 The child 2 ̆ 7 s and family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>daily</b> life patterns correspond 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 The family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>daily</b> life pattern is established by family coping strategies 2 ̆ 2. Factors found to determine these types were the child 2 ̆ 7 s sleep pattern, age, developmental stage, bad mood, and the family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> coordination of <b>daily</b> life with coping strategies. Characteristics of 2 ̆ 2 the family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>daily</b> life pattern has to adapt to the child 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 -type families include: child is 0 -to- 1 -year-old, is in post-natal developmental stage, displays an irregular sleep pattern and bad mood. Family members reported feeling uncertainty, an elevated sense of caregiver burden, and a need for further knowledge of the disease, however, limited resources are available. Characteristics of 2 ̆ 2 The child 2 ̆ 7 s and family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>daily</b> life patterns correspond 2 ̆ 2 -type families are: child is approximately 1 year old, has reached the developmental milestones for children at the 3 - 4 -month-old developmental stage. Family members expressed concern regarding motor development only. Characteristics of 2 ̆ 2 The family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>daily</b> life pattern is established by family coping strategies 2 ̆ 2 -type families include: the child is 2 to 4 years old and is still in the post-natal developmental stage.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the discursive {{practice of the}} People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Daily</b> in Beijing during the Tiananmen crisis, analyzing the complex {{process in which the}} primarily monologic discursive practice in the newspaper molded Chinese attitudes towards the incident. The significance of a systematic rhetorical investigation into the intricate mechanisms of this Chinese discursive practice is twofold. It will increase our understanding of the role that public discourse plays in the Chinese subject formation and, in turn, will contribute to cross cultural rhetoric. This study {{is part of a larger}} rhetorical investigation of how discursive practices form ideologies. ^ A Burkean and Bakhtinean critical examination of the discursive practice of the People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Daily</b> indicates that the newspaper suffered from a lack of dialogism. In repeating endlessly one human agent 2 ̆ 7 s symbolic act of naming, the newspaper ignored, suppressed, and silenced its own rich philosophical and cultural potentials. As a result, during the Tiananmen incident, (1) the newspaper was effective only in molding some elite competing 2 ̆ 2 Rectifiers of the Mandate of Heaven; 2 ̆ 2 (2) the one version of the Tiananmen events that the People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Daily</b> published held little meaning for a majority of the Chinese people; and finally (3) this self-sealing discursive practice even made the Party 2 ̆ 7 s own revolutionary traditions suffer. ^ The study concludes that the People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Daily</b> has to become a more dialogic discursive practice, inviting different voices of the Chinese culture to participate in discussions of political, cultural, and social affairs. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - To {{construct}} web visibility {{profiles of}} news web sites by examining hyperlinks {{pointing to the}} sites. Design/methodology/approach - National newspapers from USA (USA Today), Canada (The Globe and Mail), China (People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Daily)</b> as well as Hong Kong (<b>Sing</b> Tao <b>Daily)</b> were selected for the study. A total of 1, 859 links pointing to the four news sites were manually classified into the four aspects of language, country, types of sites, and reasons or purposes for linking. Findings - A comparison of the four news sites provided useful information on their web visibility. The Globe and Mail {{seemed to have a}} larger international reach than USA Today. Neither newspaper web site attracted links from China or from pages in the Chinese language. Outside China, People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Daily,</b> an official Chinese Government newspaper, is not as visible as Hong Kong based <b>Sing</b> Tao <b>Daily.</b> USA Today and The Globe and Mail were used more for news citing or reprinting purposes while People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Daily</b> seemed to be used more as a research resource. Research limitations/implications - Link analysis like this provides us with only an indirect view of the online readership and the methodology has limitations. Not all readers create links to the newspaper sites that they visit. Readers could be led to a news site through other venues including 2 ̆ 2 social bookmarking 2 ̆ 2 services. Practical implications - The study shows that link analysis is a novel and useful method that journalists and information professionals can use to gauge online readership and potential impact of news sites. Originality/value - Presented a novel method that complements but not replaces other web user studies such as web server log analysis. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Daily,</b> {{the most}} widely {{circulated}} newspaper in China, {{has served as the}} central government 2 ̆ 7 s mouthpiece for decades. While its importance and its coverage of specific events have been studied extensively, little research has examined how its coverage has changed through history. Understanding the evolution of the newspaper, however, requires determining whether any differences in coverage have occurred over time. This study aims to identify differences in topics, authorship, use of quotations, and critiques of the government as well as praise in editorials of the People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Daily</b> from 1977 to 2010. By means of a longitudinal content analysis, it compares the frequency of use of aspects in 18 categories before and after 1989, a pivotal year in Chinese history. The results indicate government and party issues were fewer while other topics increased; government official authors were fewer while other author identities increased; and more quotations, more government criticism and more reforms were mentioned in the post- 1989 period. These results indicate that the People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Daily</b> 2 ̆ 7 s coverage did change significantly in many respects, although {{it is difficult to determine}} the causes of the changes [...] economic factors, reduced political control, social changes or globalization forces...|$|R
