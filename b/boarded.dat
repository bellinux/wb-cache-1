5|$|For three hours, Experiment battled the barges, sinking two {{and killing}} {{a great many}} of the picaroons. During this time two of the barges left the warship and {{attacked}} the merchant ships. These barges managed to protect themselves from Experiment by sailing behind the schooner Mary, which was between the two barges and the warship. The Haitians <b>boarded</b> Mary and killed her captain. Many of the crew jumped into the sea, and the rest hid in the hold. The second barge attempted to take Daniel and Mary but was sunk by fire from Experiment. Once the Haitians had <b>boarded</b> Mary, Experiment opened fire upon her with grapeshot, driving the picaroons off.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} <b>board</b> size {{decisions}} {{should be based}} on a sound understanding of how <b>board</b> size influence <b>board</b> processes which in turn affect <b>board</b> performance. The paper applied mediation analysis to show how the size of <b>boards</b> in Pacific Islands Countries indirectly affects <b>board</b> performance through <b>board</b> processes. The study found that increasing <b>board</b> size for relatively medium or large-sized <b>boards</b> indirectly reduced <b>board</b> performance through its effect on the processes of effort norms, cognitive conflict, and use of knowledge and skills. Overall, the findings confirm the role of <b>board</b> process as an important mediator in the relationship between <b>board</b> size and <b>board</b> performance, which therefore should be taken into account in <b>board</b> appointment decisions to improve <b>board</b> performance in PICs enterprises...|$|R

5|$|This ceiling conceals the mediaeval trusses of {{the fifteenth}} century ceiling. The wagon roof over the chancel was <b>boarded</b> or plastered, as slots in the {{principals}} show, in 1491 by William Stratford, DTh, Abbot of Vale Royal Abbey (in post 1476–1516, with gaps); the exact dating was derived from the timbers, which retain complete sapwood. The original ceiling can still be reached from the ringing chamber in the central tower, and includes an arch-braced collar-beam truss, with traces of five cross-ribs equally spaced on the soffit of the four-centred moulded arch. The truss had slots for the panels of a <b>boarded</b> ceiling (a wagon roof).|$|E
5|$|Unmanned {{boats were}} the first vessels to enter the lagoon. Onboard {{instruments}} allowed remote-controlled radiation measurements to be made. When support ships entered the lagoon for evaluation, decontamination, and salvage activities, they steered clear of lagoon water hot spots detected by the drone boats. The standard for radiation exposure to personnel {{was the same as}} that used by the Manhattan Project: 0.1 roentgens per day. Because of this constraint, only the five most distant target ships could be <b>boarded</b> on the first day. The closer-in ships were hosed down by Navy fireboats using saltwater and flame retardants. The first hosing reduced radioactivity by half, but subsequent hosings were ineffective. For most of the ships, reboarding had to wait until the short-lived radioisotopes decayed; ten days elapsed before the last of the targets could be <b>boarded.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{circumstance}} {{occurred during}} the action which so strongly marks the invincible spirit of British seamen, when engaging the enemies of their country, that I cannot resist the pleasure I have in making it known to their Lordships; the Temeraire was <b>boarded</b> by accident; or design, by a French ship on one side, and a Spaniard on the other; the contest was vigorous, but, {{in the end the}} combined ensigns were torn from the poop and the British hoisted in their places. Collingwood's account, probably based largely on Harvey's report {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the battle, contained several errors. Temeraire had closely engaged two French ships, rather than a French and a Spanish ship, and had not been <b>boarded</b> by either during the action. Nevertheless, the account was popular and a print was rushed out purporting to show Harvey taking the lead in clearing Temeraires decks of enemy seamen.|$|E
