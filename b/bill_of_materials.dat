25|$|Joseph Orlickly {{and others}} at IBM {{developed}} a push approach to inventory control and production planning, now known as material requirements planning (MRP), which takes as input both the master production schedule (MPS) and the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> (BOM) and gives as output a schedule for the materials (components) needed in the production process. MRP therefore is a planning tool to manage purchase orders and production orders (also called jobs).|$|E
25|$|Typical {{responsibilities}} may include: daily {{operations of}} field work activities {{and organization of}} subcontractors; coordination of {{the implementation of a}} project, ensuring it is being built correctly; project schedules and forecasts; interpretation of drawings for tradesmen; review of engineering deliverables; redlining drawings; regular project status reports; budget monitoring and trend tracking; <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> creation and maintenance; effective communications between engineering, technical, construction, and project controls groups; and assistance to the project manager.|$|E
2500|$|One common {{scheme is}} {{the letter and}} digit code for {{resistance}} values following IEC 60062. It avoids using a decimal separator and replaces the decimal separator with a letter loosely associated with SI prefixes corresponding with the part's resistance. For example, 8K2 as part marking code, in a circuit diagram or in a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> (BOM) indicates a resistor value of 8.2kΩ. Additional zeros imply a tighter tolerance, for example 15M0 for three significant digits. When the value can be expressed {{without the need for}} a prefix (that is, multiplicator 1), an [...] "R" [...] is used instead of the decimal separator. For example, 1R2 indicates 1.2Ω, and 18R indicates 18Ω.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, in the sixties, a {{different}} approach was developed by George W. Plossl and Oliver W. Wight, this approach was continued by Joseph Orlicky {{as a response to}} the TOYOTA Manufacturing Program which led to Material Requirements Planning (MRP) at IBM, latter gaining momentum in 1972 when the American Production and Inventory Control Society launched the [...] "MRP Crusade". One of the key insights of this management system was the distinction between dependent demand and independent demand. Independent demand is demand which originates outside of the production system, therefore not directly controllable, and dependent demand is demand for components of final products, therefore subject to being directly controllable by management through the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> via product design. Orlicky wrote [...] "Materials Requirement Planning" [...] in 1975, the first hard cover book on the subject. MRP II was developed by Gene Thomas at IBM, and expanded the original MRP software to include additional production functions. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is the modern software architecture, which addresses, besides production operations, distribution, accounting, human resources and procurement.|$|E

50|$|The bill of {{resources}} complements the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> (BOM), which lists physical sub-components of a product. Like a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> BORs are hierarchical {{with the top}} level representing the finished product or sub-assembly.|$|E

The different types of BOMs depend on the business need and use {{for which they are}} intended. In process industries, the BOM is also known as the formula, recipe, or ingredients list. The phrase [...] "bill of material" [...] (or BOM) is frequently used by engineers as an adjective to refer not to the literal bill, but to the current production configuration of a product, to distinguish it from modified or improved versions under study or in test.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{objective}} of companies {{is to create}} a digital connectivity within a production. To achieve a comprehensively connected production it is necessary to identify interdependencies between elements within a production process. Elements, in this context, are for example the inventory, the machine utilization or the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>material.</b> This paper shows a method to identify direct dependencies and influences of these elements between each other. An example therefore is the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>material.</b> The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> gives an overview of required parts. An inventory check shows if these parts are available. Missing parts are ordered, available parts are send into production.

First, it is necessary to collect these elements within a production process. Following by the identification of the element specification and interdependencies.
