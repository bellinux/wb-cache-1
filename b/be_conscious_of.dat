Sentience is a minimalistic way of defining consciousness, which is otherwise commonly used to collectively describe sentience plus other characteristics of the mind.|$|E

In order to avoid this, her female figures typically possess European features. Lewis had to balance her own personal identity with her artistic, social, and national identity, a tiring activity that affected her art.|$|E

25|$|Awareness: {{the state}} or ability to perceive, to feel, or to <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> events, objects, or sensory patterns. In this level of consciousness, sense data can be {{confirmed}} by an observer without necessarily implying understanding. More broadly, it is {{the state or}} quality of being aware of something. In biological psychology, awareness {{is defined as a}} human's or an animal's perception and cognitive reaction to a condition or event.|$|E
25|$|Promoting {{independence}} in self-care can provide {{older adults with}} the capability to maintain independence longer and can leave them {{with a sense of}} achievement when they complete a task unaided. Older adults that require assistance with activities of daily living are at a greater risk of losing their independence with self-care tasks as dependent personal behaviours are often met with reinforcement from caregivers. It is important for caregivers to ensure that measures are put into place to preserve and promote function rather than contribute to a decline in status in an older adult that has physical limitations. Caregivers need to <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> actions and behaviors that cause older adults to become dependent on them and need to allow older patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Providing information to the older patient on why it is important to perform self-care may allow them to see the benefit in performing self-care independently. If the older adult is able to complete self-care activities on their own, or even if they need supervision, encourage them in their efforts as maintaining independence can provide them with a sense of accomplishment and the ability to maintain independence longer.|$|E
25|$|It is only by {{maintaining}} such a continual vigilance that the sociologists can spot {{themselves in the}} act of importing their own biases into their work. Reflexivity is, therefore, a kind of additional stage in the scientific epistemology. It is not enough for the scientist to go through the usual stages (research, hypothesis, falsification, experiment, repetition, peer review, etc.); Bourdieu recommends also that the scientist purge their work of the prejudices likely to derive from their social position. In a good illustration of the process, Bourdieu chastises academics (including himself) for judging their students' work against a rigidly scholastic linguistic register, favouring students whose writing appears 'polished', marking down those guilty of 'vulgarity'. Without a reflexive analysis of the snobbery being deployed under the cover of those subjective terms, the academic will unconsciously reproduce a degree of class prejudice, promoting the student with high linguistic capital and holding back the student who lacks it — not because of the objective quality of the work but simply because of the register in which it is written. Reflexivity should enable the academic to <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> their prejudices, e.g. for apparently sophisticated writing, and impel them to take steps to correct for this bias.|$|E

500|$|Khmer {{employs a}} system of {{registers}} in which the speaker must always <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> the social status of the person spoken to. The different registers, which include those used for common speech, polite speech, speaking to or about royals and speaking to or about monks, employ alternate verbs, names of body parts and pronouns. This results in what appears to foreigners as separate languages and, in fact, isolated villagers often are unsure how to speak with royals and royals raised completely within the court do not feel comfortable speaking the common register. As an example, the word for [...] "to eat" [...] used between intimates or in reference to animals is [...] Used in polite reference to commoners, it is [...] When used of those of higher social status, it is [...] or [...] For monks the word is [...] and for royals, [...] Another {{result is that the}} pronominal system is complex and full of honorific variations, just a few of which are shown in the table below.|$|E

[...] The {{magazine}} also takes note of her [...] "ease with glad-handing", and The Hollywood Reporter credits her as [...] "the Best People Person since Bill Clinton". While presenting Swift an award for her humanitarian endeavors in 2012, Michelle Obama described her as a singer who [...] "has rocketed {{to the top of}} the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year-old can accomplish". Swift considers Obama to be a role model. Swift is one of the most followed people on social media, and is known for her friendly interactions with her fans. She has delivered holiday gifts to fans by mail and in person, dubbed [...] "Swiftmas". She considers it her [...] "responsibility" [...] to <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> her influence on young fans, and has said that her fans are [...] "the longest and best relationship I have ever had".|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} English language uses of [...] "conscious" [...] and [...] "consciousness" [...] date back, however, to the 1500s. [...] The English word [...] "conscious" [...] originally {{derived from}} the Latin conscius (con- [...] "together" [...] and [...] "to know"), but the Latin word {{did not have the}} same meaning as our word—it meant [...] "knowing with", in other words [...] "having joint or common knowledge with another". [...] There were, however, many occurrences in Latin writings of the phrase conscius sibi, which translates literally as [...] "knowing with oneself", or in other words [...] "sharing knowledge with oneself about something". [...] This phrase had the figurative meaning of [...] "knowing that one knows", as the modern English word [...] "conscious" [...] does. [...] In its earliest uses in the 1500s, the English word [...] "conscious" [...] retained the meaning of the Latin conscius. [...] For example, Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan wrote: [...] "Where two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said to <b>be</b> <b>Conscious</b> <b>of</b> it one to another." [...] The Latin phrase conscius sibi, whose meaning was more closely related to the current concept of consciousness, was rendered in English as [...] "conscious to oneself" [...] or [...] "conscious unto oneself". [...] For example, Archbishop Ussher wrote in 1613 of [...] "being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness". [...] Locke's definition from 1690 illustrates that a gradual shift in meaning had taken place.|$|E

2500|$|After {{his success}} with prose {{literature}} in the Science-in-Fiction genre, Carl Djerassi started to write plays. Theatre, {{even more so than}} prose, seems to fulfill his desire to work in a more “dialogical” environment than the monological natural sciences had allowed him to do. According to British director Andy Jordan, who has produced all of his plays in England, Djerassi’s dramatic works are “not wholly or straightforwardly naturalistic or realistic [...] avowedly text-driven, where ideas, themes, words and language were majorly important, a fact I had always to <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> as the director.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{attempting}} {{to resolve a}} periapical lesion of endodontic origin, {{it is essential to}} <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> these principles in order to effectively combat the infection. [...] Without proper consideration for the causes, the pulpal and periapical infection cannot be suitably treated, for effective patient management requires the correct diagnosis and removal of the cause of the infection of endodontic origin to correct the associated periapical lesion. [...] Because periapical disease is almost inevitably preceded by pulp disease, proper chemomechanical debridement of the infected root canals, together with incision and drainage of associated periradicular swellings, will usually allow for rapid improvement in patient signs and symptoms. [...] The same end can be accomplished by extracting the involved tooth.|$|E
2500|$|John Paul II {{spoke in}} French and {{occasionally}} in Creole, {{and in the}} homily outlined the basic human rights that most Haitians lacked: [...] "the opportunity to eat enough, {{to be cared for}} when ill, to find housing, to study, to overcome illiteracy, to find worthwhile and properly paid work; all that provides a truly human life for men and women, for young and old." [...] Following John Paul II's pilgrimage, the Haitian opposition to Duvalier frequently reproduced and quoted the pope's message. Shortly before leaving Haiti, John Paul II called for social change in Haiti by saying: [...] "Lift up your heads, <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> your dignity of men created in God's image...." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rand {{argues that}} {{consciousness}} is [...] "the faculty of perceiving that which exists." [...] As she puts it, [...] "to be conscious is to <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> something", that is consciousness itself cannot be distinguished or grasped except {{in relation to}} an independent reality. [...] "It cannot be aware only of itself—there is no 'itself' until it is aware of something." [...] Thus, Objectivism holds that the mind does not create reality, but rather, it {{is a means of}} discovering reality. Expressed differently, existence has [...] "primacy" [...] over consciousness, which must conform to it. Any other approach Rand termed [...] "the primacy of consciousness", including any variant of metaphysical subjectivism or theism.|$|E

2500|$|A {{sculpture}} of Ethos by Tom Bass {{was commissioned by}} the National Capital Development Commission in 1959 and unveiled in 1961. [...] "The NCDC intended that the work would emphasize that Canberra is the non-political centre, the locale of commerce and of private enterprise in its best sense." [...] The sculpture was designed to represent {{the spirit of the}} community. Bass interpreted this in the figure which he intended [...] "the love which Canberra people have for their city to be identified with her...I want them to <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> her first as an image from a distance...then comes the moment when they become personally involved with her... they feel her looking at them, reflecting their love for the place".|$|E
2500|$|The American Medical Association (AMA) {{states that}} [...] "Physicians {{generally}} should not treat themselves {{or members of}} their immediate family". This code seeks to protect patients and physicians because professional objectivity can be compromised when the physician is treating a loved one. [...] Studies from multiple health organizations have illustrated that physician-family member relationships may cause an increase in diagnostic testing and costs. [...] Many doctors treat their family members. Doctors who do so must be vigilant not to create conflicts of interest or treat inappropriately. [...] Physicians that treat family members need to <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> conflicting expectations and dilemmas when treating relatives, as established medical ethical principles may not be morally imperative when family members are confronted with serious illness.|$|E

The change implied by this new stage in its evolution is that whereas heretofore this tender plant was protected in its obscurity from the attention of external elements, it has now become exposed. This exposure invites close observation, and that observation will eventually lead to opposition in various quarters. So, far from adopting a carefree attitude, the community must <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>of</b> the necessity to present a correct view of itself and an accurate understanding of its purpose to a largely skeptical public. A greater effort, a greater care must now be exercised to ensure its protection against the malice of the ignorant and the unwisdom of its friends." ...|$|E
