5|$|On 4 March 2016, {{a prison}} officer (Adrian Ismay) {{had a heart}} attack and died in a hospital. He had {{received}} serious wounds following a <b>booby-trap</b> bomb detonating under his van on Hillsborough Drive, East Belfast 11 days earlier. The wounds he received from the bombing were directly responsible for the heart attack that killed him. The 'New' IRA claimed responsibility and said it was a response to the alleged mistreatment of republican prisoners at Maghaberry Prison. It added that the officer was targeted because he trained prison officers at Maghaberry.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the inner}} {{security}} zone, the Schutzstreifen, a further 743people (15%) were {{arrested by the}} guards. 48people (1%) were stopped– i.e. killed or injured– by landmines and 43people (0.9%) by SM-70 directional mines on the fence. A further 67people (1.35%) were intercepted at the fence (shot and/or arrested). A total of 229people– just 4.6% of attempted escapees, representing less than one in twenty– made it across the fence. Of these, the largest number (129, or 55% of successful escapees) succeeded in making it across the fence in unmined sectors. 89people (39% of escapees) managed to cross both the minefields and the fence, but just 12people (6% of the total) succeeded in getting past the SM-70s <b>booby-trap</b> mines on the fences.|$|E

25|$|The {{low-level}} 'dissident republican' campaign continued. In January 2009, {{security forces}} had to defuse {{a bomb in}} Castlewellan, and in 2008 three separate incidents saw dissident republicans attempt to kill Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officers in Derry, Castlederg and Dungannon. In all three cases, PSNI officers were seriously wounded. Two of the attacks involved firearms while the other involved an under-car <b>booby-trap</b> bomb.|$|E
25|$|In July 2014, three Israeli {{soldiers}} {{died from}} a <b>booby-trap</b> in a clinic. Initially it {{was reported to be}} an UNRWA clinic but the IDF shortly thereafter retracted the claim thought it was noted that it had an UNRWA sign on it. The UNRWA sign on the building therefore may have been stolen and placed there by someone, perhaps seeking to protect the building.|$|E
25|$|Bombs had {{exploded}} in Omagh twice before. On 17 May 1973, four off-duty British Army {{soldiers were killed}} by a Provisional IRA <b>booby-trap</b> bomb while getting into a car, outside the Knock-na-Moe Castle Hotel, Omagh. One died of his injuries on 3 June 1973. On 25 June 1973, three Provisional IRA volunteers {{were killed in a}} premature bomb explosion while travelling in a car on Gortin Road, near Omagh.|$|E

25|$|A first <b>booby-trap</b> bomb {{directed}} at assassinating Palmer was mailed by anarchists linked to Luigi Galleani. This first bomb was intercepted and defused, but two months later, Palmer {{and his family}} narrowly escaped death when an anarchist exploded a bomb on their porch. The home of a Department of Justice Bureau of Investigation (BOI) field agent Rayme Weston Finch was also attacked. Finch had previously arrested two prominent Galleanists while leading a police raid on the offices of their publication Cronaca Sovversiva.|$|E
25|$|The Führungsstelle or Kommandoturm ("command tower") was {{a shorter}} and rarer type of tower {{that served as}} the command centre of a border sector. It {{contained}} monitoring and control equipment to open border gates remotely, turn on and off fence lighting and alert lights, rotate searchlights and so on. Disturbances of the signal wire and detonations of SM-70 <b>booby-trap</b> mines would be detected by the command tower. The towers were topped with long-range radio antennae to communicate via R-105 radio to other units. A distinctive feature of this type of tower was the prominent air intake box at ground level.|$|E
25|$|On 15 June, US airstrikes in Mosul killed Ali Awni al-Harzi, a Tunisian ISIL {{operative}} {{who was a}} CIA {{person of}} interest, and had suspected links to the 2012 Benghazi attack. He was also said to operate closely with ISIL militants in North Africa and across the Middle East. He was the brother of Tariq bin al-Tahar bin al-Falih al-'Awni al-Harzi, {{who was killed in}} Syria the following day. On 23 June, Zaalan al-Afari, the finance minister of ISIL, was killed with four other ISIL militants by a <b>booby-trap</b> on the road while returning from the town of Gayara to Mosul.|$|E

25|$|A large {{counter-attack}} {{was mounted}} on the French front on 22 March, which forced French cavalry and cyclists back over the Crozat Canal with many casualties but began too soon to ambush a large force that included artillery, as had been intended. A <b>Booby-trap</b> exploded in Bapaume town hall on 25 March, killing Australian troops and two French Deputies; French civilians were left behind at Bouvincourt, Vraignes and Tincourt on 26 March and Villers Faucon, Saulcourt and Guyencourt were lost on 27 March, to attacks by British cavalry and armoured cars. Supplies of armour-piercing bullets had been sent forward by the Germans after Roisel was captured the day before, resulting in the armoured cars being peppered with bullet-holes. The armoured cars decoyed the German defenders, while cavalry got round the flanks and captured the villages.|$|E
25|$|Beginning 8 November, American and Iraqi forces {{invaded the}} militant stronghold of Fallujah in Operation Phantom Fury, killing and {{capturing}} many insurgents. Many rebels {{were thought to}} have fled the city before the invasion. U.S.-backed figures put insurgency losses at over 2,000. It was the bloodiest single battle for the U.S. in the war, with 92 Americans dead and several hundred wounded. A video showing the killing {{of at least one}} unarmed and wounded man by an American serviceman surfaced, throwing renewed doubt and outrage at the efficiency of the U.S. occupation. The Marine was later cleared of any wrongdoing because the Marines had been warned that the enemy would sometimes feign death and <b>booby-trap</b> bodies as a tactic to lure Marines to their deaths. November was the deadliest month of the occupation for coalition troops, surpassing April.|$|E
25|$|In late March 1971, {{when the}} 5th Special Force Group was redeployed to the U.S., the Command and Control {{elements}} were renamed Task Force Advisory Elements (TF1AE, TF2AE and TF3AE). They originally consisted of 244 U.S. and 780 indigenous personnel each, {{but they were}} quickly drawn down by {{the elimination of the}} exploitation forces. For SOG, Vietnamization was finally nigh. On 1 May 1972, the unit was reduced in strength and renamed the Strategic Technical Directorate Assistance Team 158 (STDAT-158). The Ground Studies Group was disestablished and replaced by the Liaison Service Advisory Detachments. SOG's air elements stood down for redeployment, the JPRC was turned over to MACV and redesignated the Joint Casualty Resolution Center, while the psychological operations personnel and installations were turned over to either the STD or JUSPAO.. The final casualty of SOG ground operations occurred on October 11, 1971 when Sergeant First Class Audley D. Mills was killed when a <b>booby-trap</b> he was trying to disarm detonated.|$|E

500|$|Engel {{obtained}} {{stories from}} moderately well-known science fiction names for both issues, including John Jakes, Mack Reynolds, Jack Vance, and Raymond F. Jones, {{but many of}} the stories were [...] "barrel-scrapings" [...] from the Scott Meredith Literary Agency, {{in the words of one}} historian; most had already been rejected at the other active science fiction markets. Space SF also published Arthur C. Clarke's [...] "Critical Mass", one of the popular [...] "White Hart" [...] stories. It had already appeared in a 1949 edition of a British magazine, Lilliput, but Clarke revised it for this publication. Overall, in the words of Mike Ashley, [...] "... carried stories by noted sf writers, [...] they read like rejects from better magazines, and there was nothing of lasting value". Ashley comments that the best story was Jakes's [...] "The Devil Spins a Sun-Dream", which was atmospheric if poorly plotted; the protagonist, a human prospector on Mars, finds a fabulous city, but an ancient <b>booby-trap</b> destroys it before his eyes.|$|E

The remote controlled batarang is similarly upgraded to include a scanner that can be thrown out to gain information on the surrounding area.
