500|$|Hotel Chevalier {{was one of}} the year's most {{discussed}} short films, {{and attracted}} considerable praise from film critics, who compared it favorably to The Darjeeling Limited. Gary Susman of Entertainment Weekly described it as [...] "an exquisite short story where we learn not much but exactly enough about these two characters", adding that [...] "Chevalier sees Anderson working in his customary jewel-box/dollhouse mode, but the form and length really suit each other here." [...] Armond White of New York Press judged the short [...] "moving and genuinely contemporary", citing its [...] "lost-girl poignancy". The film drew some attention for co-star Natalie Portman's extended nude scene, and for her character's <b>bruised</b> <b>body.</b> Portman expressed disappointment at this undue focus, saying [...] "t really depressed me that half of every review … was about the nudity". The episode made the actress reconsider the wisdom of this aspect of her performance, and she subsequently swore off nude appearances in film.|$|E
2500|$|In the final, 10-lap {{segment of}} the race, Dale Earnhardt led, {{followed}} by Kyle Petty and Davey. [...] In the third turn on the final lap, Petty got under Earnhardt's car and the GM Goodwrench Chevrolet spun. [...] Davey took advantage of this and jumped into the lead. [...] But Petty charged back and as Davey crossed the start-finish line to win the race, the two cars came together, sending the driver's side of Davey's car hard into the outside wall {{in a shower of}} sparks. An unconscious Allison was taken from his car and airlifted to a Charlotte hospital. The crash left him with a concussion, bruised lung, and a battered and <b>bruised</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
2500|$|At 15, {{he was a}} boxer who billed {{himself as}} [...] "Kid Crochet". [...] His prizefighting earned him a broken nose (later straightened), a scarred lip, many broken {{knuckles}} (a result {{of not being able}} to afford tape used to wrap boxers' hands), and a <b>bruised</b> <b>body.</b> Of his 12 bouts, he said: [...] "I won all but 11." [...] For a time, he shared a New York City apartment with Sonny King, who like Martin, was starting in show business and had little money. [...] Martin and King reportedly [...] held bare-knuckle matches in their apartment, fighting until one was knocked out; people paid to watch. Martin knocked out King in the first round of an amateur boxing match. Martin gave up boxing to work as a roulette stickman and croupier in an illegal casino behind a tobacco shop, where he had started as a stock boy. At the same time, he sang with local bands, calling himself [...] "Dino Martini" [...] (after the Metropolitan Opera tenor, Nino Martini). He got his break working for the Ernie McKay Orchestra. He sang in a crooning style influenced by Harry Mills (of the Mills Brothers), among others. In the early 1940s, he started singing for bandleader Sammy Watkins, who suggested he change his name to Dean Martin.|$|E

50|$|Ravi Khanna {{has worked}} hard to be where he is now - a Judge in Bombay High Court. He {{had fallen in love with}} {{beautiful}} lawyer Rama, and had married her. His brother, Sumit, is a college student, who has always excelled in sports and studies. Sumit is in love with Anju, the only daughter of Diwan Pratap Singh, an alliance that is suitable both for the Khanna's and the Diwan, and preparations are on for their marriage. Then one day Anju goes missing. A lengthy search leads to the discovery of her battered and <b>bruised</b> <b>body.</b> Diwan and Sumit are devastated by her death. Anju's death is followed by the brutal death of five more college students. Police Inspector Khan's investigation leads him to conclude that Sumit Khanna has committed these murders, and he arrests Sumit.

50|$|With the V-2 {{missiles}} came {{two types}} of the same disease. First is the Blood Death which kills the subject instantly in a gruesome way. The arteries become blocked and explode, the skin splits and blood pours from every orifice. The Slow Death has the same climax but takes longer to work, up to years, and weakens the subject, blackens their fingers and hands and <b>bruises</b> their <b>body</b> internally. Victims of the Slow Death are generally much weaker and slower to react than the AB negs, however some individuals (such as McGruder, Hubble's bodyguard) seem less prone to its debilitating effects.|$|R

5000|$|The {{dinner party}} is {{disturbed}} by an ambulance arriving, someone else having found Alfie's heavily <b>bruised</b> <b>body</b> on Clapham Common. Belinda is clearly distressed by this, running outside {{to see what}} has happened. Meanwhile, Will and Gavin are sitting on a bench, presumably {{in another part of}} Clapham Common given the title of the film (but actually miles away in the park on Primrose Hill in north London), with Will having fallen asleep on Gavin's shoulder. Gavin cuddles up to Will, and looks out over London. Terry returns home to his nan who is asleep in bed, while the dinner party discussion turns to gay men and sex in public places. The conversation clearly makes Robin uncomfortable, as Marion rants on about a perceived tendency to [...] "push it homosexuality in your face". Belinda, clearly still upset by the beating that has occurred outside, breaks up the argument, making the point that [...] "no one deserves to be treated like that", regardless of whether he was a straight man walking through the park or [...] "sniffing around and fucking like a dog in the bushes".|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, the Cultural Revolution {{is about}} to break forth, led by {{adolescents}} seeking to [...] "rebel" [...] against {{those who seek to}} rein them in: their parents, teachers, and even party members the central government deemed dangerous. The stepfather, a prominent party member about to be disgraced, worries about saving his wife and stepson and does what he can to provide a safe life for them before it is too late. He offers them money and to divorce Shujuan. Perhaps unable to see another husband taken from her, Shujuan returns to her husband's home as he's being lifted out of his home by the rebelling Red Guards. The last scenes are of Tietou's mother being dragged away by Red Guards, who also beat Tietou. At the end, the boy is lying on the ground, bloodied. In a voice-over, he tells of his stepfather's death from heart failure; his mother is sent to the work camps, but his own fate is left unknown. The camera pans out from his <b>bruised</b> <b>body</b> as he lies there looking up to see a broken blue kite hanging in the tree.|$|E

He was not identified until July 2008. In Bond County, Illinois, Jones had been charged in absentia with Walters' murder.|$|R
