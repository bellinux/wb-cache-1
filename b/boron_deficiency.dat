2500|$|The {{stage of}} fruit set follows {{flowering}} almost immediately, when the fertilized flower begins {{to develop a}} seed and grape berry to protect the seed. In the Northern Hemisphere, this normally takes place in May and in the Southern Hemisphere in November. This stage is very critical for wine production since it determines the potential crop yield. Not every flower on the vine gets fertilized, with the unfertilized flowers eventually falling off the vine. The percentage of fertilized flowers averages around 30 but can get as high as 60 or be much lower. Climate {{and the health of}} the vine play an important role with low humidity, high temperatures and water stress having the potential of severely reducing the amount flowers that get fertilized. Coulure occurs when there is an imbalance of carbohydrate levels in the vine tissues and some berries fail to set or simply fall off the bunch. Varieties like Grenache and Malbec are prone to this abnormal fruit set. Millerandage occurs when some fertilized flowers do not form seeds but only small berry clusters. Grape berry size depends on the number of seeds so berries with no seeds will be significantly smaller than berries containing seeds. On one cluster there may be berries of various sizes which can create problems during winemaking due to the varying [...] "skin to pulp" [...] ratio among the grapes. This can be caused by vine disease, such as fanleaf, or by a <b>boron</b> <b>deficiency</b> in the vine. Gewürztraminer and the Chardonnay clones IA and Mendoza are both prone to millerandage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Boron</b> <b>{{deficiency}}</b> is {{a common}} deficiency of the micronutrient boron in plants. It is the most widespread micronutrient deficiency {{around the world and}} causes large losses in crop production and crop quality. <b>Boron</b> <b>deficiency</b> affects vegetative and reproductive growth of plants, resulting in inhibition of cell expansion, death of meristem, and reduced fertility.|$|E
50|$|Little leaf {{syndrome}} has {{not been}} fully explained, but has often been confused with <b>boron</b> <b>deficiency.</b> The growing point is damaged, sometimes by Oryctes beetles. Small, distorted leaves resembling a <b>boron</b> <b>deficiency</b> emerge. This is often followed by secondary pathogenic infections in the spear {{that can lead to}} spear rot and palm death.|$|E
25|$|Boric acid is used {{to treat}} or prevent <b>boron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in plants. It is also used in {{preservation}} of grains such as rice and wheat.|$|R
50|$|Inadequate {{amounts of}} boron affect many {{agricultural}} crops, legume forage crops most strongly. Of the micronutrients, <b>boron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> are {{second most common}} after zinc. Deficiency results {{in the death of}} the terminal growing points and stunted growth.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{growth and}} yield are also limited by zinc and <b>boron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in the soil. Boron-rich soil {{resulted}} in an increase of chickpea yield and size, while soil fertilization with zinc {{seemed to have no}} apparent effect on the chickpea yield.|$|R
5000|$|Boron {{is present}} in the soil in many forms, the most common being Boric Acid (H3BO3). An {{adequate}} amount of boron in the soil is 12 mg/kg. If the boron content of the soil drops below 0.14 mg/kg then <b>boron</b> <b>deficiency</b> is likely to be observed. <b>Boron</b> <b>deficiency</b> is also observed in basic soils with a high pH because in basic conditions boric acid exists in an undissociated form which the plant is unable to absorb. [...] Soils with low organic matter content (<1.5%) are also susceptible to <b>boron</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Highly leached sandy soils are also characteristic of <b>boron</b> <b>deficiency</b> because the boron will not be retained in the soil. [...] Boron toxicity is also possible if the boron content of the soil is high enough that the plant cannot cope with the excess boron. The levels at which boron is toxic to plants varies with different species of plants.|$|E
50|$|<b>Boron</b> <b>deficiency</b> is a {{pathology}} {{which may}} occur in animals {{due to a}} lack of boron. A report given by E. Wayne Johnson et al. at the 2005 Alan D. Leman Swine Conference suggests that <b>boron</b> <b>deficiency</b> produces osteochondrosis in swine that is correctable by addition of 50 ppm of boron to the diet. The amount of boron required by animals and humans is not yet well established.|$|E

50|$|<b>Boron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> can be {{detected}} by analysis of plant material to apply a correction before the obvious symptoms appear, after which {{it is too late}} to prevent crop loss. Strawberries deficient in boron will produce lumpy fruit; apricots will not blossom or, if they do, will not fruit or will drop their fruit depending on the level of boron deficit. Broadcast of boron supplements is effective and long term; a foliar spray is immediate but must be repeated.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: To characterise {{symptoms}} of macronutrient and <b>boron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in hybrid clones ofEucalyptus grandis with Eucalyptus urophylla, a trial was conducted using nutrient solution, withtreatments including complete solution and minus N, minus P, minus K, minus Ca, minus Mg, minus Sand minus B with four replicates. Descriptions {{of the symptoms}} were made monthly, 4 months afterthe establishment of the treatments. Samples of leaves were collected to determine nutrient concentrations,taking the fifth and sixth leaf as standards, counted {{from the tip of}} the branches in both upperand lower parts of the crown. Another sampling was performed, collecting only leaves with deficiencysymptoms,for N, P, K and Mg using old leaves and for Ca, S and B young leaves. The sequence of symptomsappearance was N, P, B, K, Ca, Mg and S. Nutrients concentrations in leaves of treatments withomitted nutrients were lower as compared to leaves of the complete treatment, indicating that thesymptoms described were really due to the deficiency effect. The nutrient concentration of leaves withhigh symptoms was smaller than those for the fifth and sixth leaves, except for calcium. Eventhough,these leaves appeared to be adequate to predict nutritional deficiencies in Eucalyptus. The highestintensity of symptoms occurred for boron and the lowest for sulphur...|$|R

50|$|Plants contain boron both in a {{water-soluble}} and insoluble form. In intact plants, {{the amount}} of water-soluble boron fluctuates with {{the amount of}} boron supplied, while insoluble boron does not.

One of the earliest symptoms of B deficiency on Dypsis lutescens (areca palm) and Syagrus romanzoffiana (queen palm) is transverse translucent streaking on the leaflets. In many species including Cocos nucifera (coconut palm), Elaeis guineensis (African oil palm), and S. romanzoffiana, mild B deficiency is manifested as sharply bent leaflet tips, commonly called “hookleaf ” (Figure 1).

40|$|Summary. The {{effect of}} <b>boron</b> (B) <b>deficiency</b> on cell {{permeability}} and connected with that, changes in soluble sugars, amino acids and ureides partitioning between root and nodule apoplast and symplast of N 2 fixing soybean plants grown in water culture were studied. Exposure of a transient 10 -day B deficiency stress {{was found to}} inhibit nodule number and to increase nodule dry weight. The formation of larger nodules in B deficient plants was found {{to coincide with the}} deterioration of solute exchange between root and nodule apoplast and symplast.

5000|$|Boric acid (16.5%boron), borax (11.3% boron) or SoluBor (20.5% boron) can {{be applied}} to soils to correct <b>boron</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Typical {{applications}} of actual boron are about 1.1 kg/hectare or 1.0 lb/acre but optimum levels of boron vary with plant type. [...] Borax, Boric Acid or Solubor can be dissolved in water and sprayed or applied to soil as a dust. Excess boron is toxic to plants so care must be taken to ensure correct application rate and even coverage. Leaves of many plants are damaged by boron; therefore, when in doubt, only apply to soil. Application of boron may not correct <b>boron</b> <b>deficiency</b> in alkaline soils because even with the addition of boron, it may remain unavailable for plant absorption. [...] Continued application of boron may be necessary in soils that are susceptible to leaching such as sandy soils. [...] Flushing soils containing toxic levels of boron with water can remove the boron through leaching.|$|E
50|$|Millerandage (or shot berries, hens and chicks and {{pumpkins}} and peas) is {{a potential}} viticultural hazard problem in which grape bunches contain berries that differ greatly in size and, most importantly, maturity. Its most common cause is cold, rainy or otherwise bad weather during the flowering stage of the vines though other factors, such as <b>boron</b> <b>deficiency</b> or fanleaf degeneration, may also play a role.|$|E
50|$|V-Bor is {{a commercially}} {{packaged}} form of borax pentahydrate (Na2B4O7·5H2O). It {{is produced by}} the Searles Valley Minerals company from minerals mined at Searles Lake. It has most of the same uses as borax. It {{is also used to}} neutralize skins/hides in leather tanning, corrects <b>boron</b> <b>deficiency</b> in plants, reduces melting temperature in glass process, is a fire retardant in cellulose insulation, and is used to make a bleaching agent for home laundry.|$|E
40|$|<b>Boron</b> (B) <b>deficiency</b> {{results in}} {{inhibition}} of pumpkin (Cucurbia moschata Duchesne) growth that {{is accompanied by}} swelling of the cell walls. Monomeric rhamnogalacturonan II (mRG-II) accounted for 80 % to 90 % of the total RG-II in B-deficient walls, whereas the borate ester cross-linked RG-II dimer (dRG-II-B) {{accounted for more than}} 80 % of the RG-II in control plants. The results of glycosyl residue and glycosyl linkage composition analyses of the RG-II from control and B-deficient plants were similar. Thus, B deficiency does not alter the primary structure of RG-II. The addition of 10 B-enriched boric acid to B-deficient plants resulted within 5 h in the conversion of mRG-II to dRG-II- 10 B. The wall thickness of the 10 B-treated plants and control plants was similar. The formation and possible functions of a borate ester cross-linked RG-II in the cell walls are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Cotton is major {{contributor}} in fiber and edible oil production of Pakistan. However, its {{growth and development}} is severely hampered by <b>boron</b> (B) <b>deficiency</b> in semi-arid regions of the country. This experiment was conducted to {{determine the influence of}} soil applied B (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 kg B ha- 1) on the performance of cotton genotypes FH- 113, MNH- 786 and CIM- 496. Boron application significantly improved the boll retention, cotton seed yield, ginning out turn and net economic returns of cotton genotypes. In this regard, soil application at 1. 5 kg B ha- 1 was the most effective. Amongst the tested genotypes, FH- 113 performed better than others. In conclusion, soil application of B at 1. 5 kg ha- 1 was the most cost effective in improving the yield and yield contributing traits of cotton and fetching the maximum net economic returns...|$|R
40|$|<b>Boron</b> (B) <b>deficiency</b> is {{widespread}} in the Anatolia region of Turkey. This could impact production and quality of Brussels sprout (Brassica oleracea L gemmifera). A 2 -year field experiment was conducted to study yield and quality response of four cultivars (Star, Brilliant, Oliver, and Maximus) to B addition (0, 1, 3, and 9 kg. ha(- 1) B). The optimum economic B rate (OEBR) ranged from 5. 5 to 6. 3 kg. ha(- 1) B resulting in soil B levels of 0. 94 to 1. 13 mg. kg(- 1). Independent of cultivar, B application decreased tissue nitrogen, calcium, and magnesium but increased tissue phosphorus, potassium, iron, manganese, zinc, and copper content. We conclude a B addition of 6 kg. ha(- 1) is sufficient to elevate soil B levels to nondeficient levels. Similar studies with different soils and initial soil test B levels are needed to conclude if these critical soil test values anti OEBR can be applied across the region...|$|R

Likewise, until recently boron tolerance was unknown but a strong borophile was discovered in bacteria. With the recent isolation of Bacillus boroniphilus, borophiles came into discussion.

50|$|Boron is {{essential}} for the proper forming and strengthening of cell walls. Lack of boron results in short thick cells producing stunted fruiting bodies and roots. Calcium to boron ratio must be maintained in a narrow range for normal plant growth. For alfalfa, that calcium to boron ratio must be from 80:1 to 600:1. <b>Boron</b> <b>deficiency</b> appears at 800:1 and higher. Boron levels within plants differ with plant species and range from 2.3 mg/kg for barley to 94.7 mg/kg for poppy. Lack of boron causes failure of calcium metabolism which produces hollow heart in beets and peanuts.|$|E
50|$|Boron {{is absorbed}} by {{plants in the}} form of the anion BO. It is {{available}} to plants in moderately soluble mineral forms of Ca, Mg and Na borates and the highly soluble form of organic compounds. It is available to plants over a range of pH, from 5.0 to 7.5. It is mobile in the soil, hence, it is prone to leaching. Leaching removes substantial amounts of boron in sandy soil, but little in fine silt or clay soil. Boron's fixation to those minerals at high pH can render boron unavailable, while low pH frees the fixed boron, leaving it prone to leaching in wet climates. It precipitates with other minerals {{in the form of}} borax in which form it was first used over 400 years ago as a soil supplement. Decomposition of organic material causes boron to be deposited in the topmost soil layer. When soil dries it can cause a precipitous drop in the availability of boron to plants as the plants cannot draw nutrients from that desiccated layer. Hence, <b>boron</b> <b>deficiency</b> diseases appear in dry weather.|$|E

Colorimetric methods are still widely used in soil-testing laboratories in India for measuring B. Little information is available on the comparative evaluation of the colorimetric and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) methods for determining extractable B in soils. We describe results of the comparative evaluation of these methods for measuring extractable B in 57 soil samples with pH values ranging from 5. 3 to 9. 5. There was a significant correlation between B values determined by the two methods, and the correlation coefficient was greater for soil samples with pH in the neutral to alkaline range. Interaction between soil samples and methods (ICP or colorimetric) was significant except for soil samples in the pH range of 8. 0 to 9. 5. Precision for B determination was greater with the ICP than with the colorimetric method...|$|R
40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that {{agriculture}} is the most important contributor to the global production of food. This is undeniably also the case for Nepal. In 2002, 93 % of the Nepalese workforce was deployed in agriculture (World Bank 2005). It therefore goes without saying that this line of work is vital to most Nepalese families and the national economy as a whole. Authors such as Sillanpää (1982; 1990) and Carson (1992) suggest that serve nutrient deficiencies are reducing crops on a widespread basis in Nepal, though. Of the 92 naturally occurring chemical elements, 18 have been proven to be essential elements which plants can not grow and complete their life cycle without (Brady 2004). Among the latter are zinc and boron. These two micronutrients are subject to the main investigations of this thesis and are chosen due to the findings of Mikko Sillanpää (1982; 1990), claiming that the most extensive soil deficiencies in Nepal are those of boron and zinc. This thesis is not an attempt to falsify or verify Sillanpää`s theories, but rather an effort to investigate links between zinc and <b>boron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and how the farming system is operated in a small village of semi-subsistence agriculture. Researchers state that there are soil deficiencies in the world, but not all of them have theories on why this is the case. To be able to cope with problems, one must have knowledge of the underlying causes. To obtain such knowledge, a quantitative farming system approach is applied along with a spatial approach. Studying farming system is done to obtain data for further statistical analyses. These data are used to show connections between farming practices and micronutrient levels. The spatial approach is used to add the dimension of space to the analysis, as this is not included in a normal statistical examination. It {{is important to remember that}} this is a case study and therefore not an attempt to make generalizations. It is, however, an attempt to find empiric relationships and in that way contribute to the knowledgebase of farming systems and micronutrient deficiencies in Nepal...|$|R
40|$|<b>Boron</b> (B) <b>deficiency</b> is {{widespread}} in Brazilian citrus orchards {{and has been}} considered an important soil constraint to citrus yield. The aim of this work was to study B uptake and its mobility in young citrus trees, under different B statuses, in two rootstocks.

The plants were grown in pots containing nutrient solutions under either adequate or deficient B supply. Plants with different B levels were transplanted into solution with adequate level of B, enriched in 10 B in different stages of development (vegetative growth and fruiting). About 20 to 35 % of B content in the new parts of orange tree came from plant reserves. Boron mobility within the plant was influenced by its nutritional status; that is, the longer the period was that the plants were grown under deficient supply, the smaller was the mobility.

An experiment was conducted with fertigated 4 -year-old `Valencia` sweet orange trees on `Swingle` citrumelo rootstock. Boron (isotopically-enriched 10 B) was supplied to trees once or twice in the growing season, either dripped in the soil or sprayed on the leaves. Trees were sampled at different periods and separated into different parts for total B contents and 10 B/ 11 B isotope ratios analyses. Soil B applied via fertigation was more efficient than foliar application for the organs grown after the B fertilization.

40|$|Low root {{temperature}} {{has previously}} been reported to induce <b>boron</b> (B) <b>deficiency</b> in some species but the mechanism is not entirely clear. Using B‐specific resin to buffer B concentrations in solution, we found that decreasing root zone temperature (RZT) from 27 to 12 °C for 6 days depressed sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) dry matter, root length, root to shoot ratio and B uptake. Boron uptake into the shoots was depressed at 12 °C RZT to a greater relative extent than dry matter. Furthermore, B partitioning to young leaves decreased with low RZT, particularly at 12 °C RZT. The external B requirement for shoot growth increased with low RZT. Leaf functioning was impaired by low B supply as measured by K+ leakage from the youngest mature leaf blade, whereas it was much less affected by RZT, {{and there was no}} effect of RZT on B ‐ adequate plants. By contrast, root function was impaired more by low RZT than low B. Therefore, we predict that higher rates of B application will be required for plant growth when soil temperature is below a critical threshold, which for sunflower was about 17 °C. Conversely, practices which increase soil temperature above the threshold may also improve plant B nutrition...|$|R
40|$|When crops {{of wheat}} (Triticum aestivum L.) are stressed, grain set in {{potentially}} fertile florets is reduced. Cold temperatures and <b>boron</b> (B) <b>deficiency</b> during reproductive development cause grain set failure in wheat. Patterns of grain set in cold-stressed and B-deficient wheat ears were studied {{under field conditions}} in Nepal and in controlled environments in the UK. In both B-deficient and cold-stressed circumstances, ear fertility was reduced by up to 98 % but the pattern of grain set within an ear was similar. Under cold-stressed conditions, florets in the uppermost one-third of the ear were 41 to 53 % less fertile than those located {{in the middle and}} basal regions. Even in the unstressed crops, the top one-third of the ear was less fertile than below by as much as 8 ? 13 %. Similarly, within a spikelet, the distal florets always had fewer grains than the proximal ones. Decreased grain set following stress markedly reduced yield per ear. We conclude that fertility should be assessed on the entire ear. The determination of competent florets should be based on the presence of well-developed ovaries, feathery stigmas and the structures of anthers (which can still be seen in the sterile florets at maturity) rather than on the length of the lemma or on judgements based on visual appearance or other subjective criteria.
