25|$|When {{viewed from}} an {{inertial}} frame, two orbiting bodies trace out distinct trajectories. Each of these trajectories has its focus at the common center of mass. When viewed from a non-inertial frame centred {{on one of}} the bodies, only the trajectory of the opposite body is apparent; Keplerian elements describe these non-inertial trajectories. An orbit has two sets of Keplerian elements depending on which <b>body</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> the point of reference. The reference body is called the primary, the other body is called the secondary. The primary does not necessarily possess more mass than the secondary, and even when the bodies are of equal mass, the orbital elements depend on the choice of the primary.|$|E

50|$|The Pseudo-athlete of Delos is {{a life-size}} nude male {{portrait}} {{that was found}} in the House of the Diadoumenos on the Greek island of Delos. It belonged to a Roman business man and dates back to 100 BCE. Stylistic traits of Greek sculpture, such as the contrapposto of the Polykleitan original and the sharp upturn of the head reminiscent of Hellenistic sculpture, were incorporated. In contrast, the bald head, prominent ears, and wrinkled face is reminiscent of the Republican style, as is the combination of the veristic head with the idealized body. The idealized nude body is symbolic of the concept of heroic nudity in Greek sculpture. The realistic head is symbolic of wisdom and experience that comes with age. In Greek portraiture, the head and body show a consistent age. However, in the Roman pseudo-athlete there is a disconnect. The draped cloth carefully placed across the left shoulder is reminiscent of the Roman toga, while the nude body is typical in Greek statues. The <b>body</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a prop for the head. In the Delos pseudo-athlete, nudity is used as a costume or garment since the business man would not have appeared nude in public or in front of his guests. The combination of the Greek style body with a Roman head makes the sculpture from Delos a great example of the Roman pseudo-athlete.|$|E
