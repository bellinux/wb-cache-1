50|$|The book explores, {{with great}} rigor and precision, the {{rationality}} of <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> God. In Part, I, Plantinga examines {{a number of}} traditional arguments for God's existence and concludes that none is successful. In Part II, he considers and rejects some major arguments against <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> God, including the problem of evil, the paradox of omnipotence, and verificationism. Finally, in Part III, he explores various analogies between <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> God and <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> other minds. He concludes that these two <b>beliefs</b> are <b>in</b> the same epistemic boat: if one is rationally justified, so is the other. Since <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> other minds is clearly rational, Plantinga argues, so is <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> God.|$|R

5|$|After {{the medieval}} period, the word elf tended to become less common {{throughout}} the Germanic languages, losing out to alternative native terms like zwerc ("dwarf") in German and huldra ("hidden being") in Scandinavian languages, and to loan-words like fairy (borrowed from French {{into all the}} Germanic languages). Still, <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> elves persisted in the early modern period, particularly in Scotland and Scandinavia, where elves were thought of as magically powerful people living, usually invisibly, alongside everyday human communities. They continued {{to be associated with}} causing illness and with sexual threats. For example, a number of early modern ballads in the British Isles and Scandinavia, originating in the medieval period, describe elves attempting to seduce or abduct human characters. With urbanisation and industrialisation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> elves declined rapidly (though Iceland has some claim to continued popular belief in elves). However, from the early modern period onwards, elves started to be prominent in the literature and art of educated elites. These literary elves were imagined as small, impish beings, with Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream being a key development of this idea. In the eighteenth century, German Romanticist writers were influenced by this notion of the elf, and reimported the English word elf into the German language.|$|E
5|$|Before {{contact with}} Christian missionaries during both the Dutch and Qing periods, Taiwanese aborigines held {{a variety of}} <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> spirits, gods, sacred symbols and myths that helped their {{societies}} find meaning and order. Although {{there is no evidence}} of a unified belief system shared among the various indigenous groups, there is evidence that several groups held supernatural <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> certain birds and bird behavior. The Siraya were reported by Dutch sources to incorporate bird imagery into their material culture. Other reports describe animal skulls and the use of human heads in societal beliefs. The Paiwan and other southern groups worship the Formosan hundred pacer snake and use the diamond patterns on its back in many designs. In many Plains Aborigines societies, the power to communicate with the supernatural world was exclusively held by women called Inibs. During the period of Dutch colonization, the Inibs were removed from the villages to eliminate their influence and pave the way for Dutch missionary work...|$|E

5|$|Daoism and Buddhism {{were the}} {{dominant}} religions of China in the Song era, the latter deeply impacting many beliefs {{and principles of}} Neo-Confucianism throughout the dynasty. Ironically, Buddhism came under heavy criticism by staunch Confucian advocates and philosophers of the time. Older <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> ancient Chinese mythology, folk religion, and ancestor worship also played a large part in people's daily lives, as the Chinese believed that deities and ghosts of the spiritual realm frequently interacted with the living realm.|$|E
5|$|During the Zheng and Qing eras, Han {{immigrants}} brought Confucianized {{beliefs of}} Taoism and Buddhism to Taiwan's indigenous people. Many Plains Aborigines adopted Han religious practices, {{though there is}} evidence that many aboriginal customs were transformed into local Taiwanese Han <b>beliefs.</b> <b>In</b> some parts of Taiwan the Siraya spirit of fertility, Ali-zu (A-li-tsu) has become assimilated into the Han pantheon. The use of female spirit mediums (tongji) can also be traced to the earlier matrilineal Inibs.|$|E
5|$|In Christianity, Saint Apollonia is {{the patron}} saint of {{toothache}} and other dental problems. She was an early Christian martyr who was persecuted for her <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> Alexandria during the Imperial Roman age. A mob struck her repeatedly in the face until all her teeth were smashed. She was threatened with being burned alive unless she renounced Christianity, but she instead chose to throw herself onto the fire.

The Personal Norm of Reciprocity Scale, Trait Forgiveness Scale, Prosocial Tendency Measure, and Altruism Scale were used to assess extent of <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> reciprocity, forgiveness, and prosocial motivation, respectively, among 204 Chinese undergraduates. The results indicated that <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> reciprocity was a partially negative, but not neutral, reciprocity norm for Chinese people. Specifically, <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> reciprocity was positively related to negative reciprocity, but not significantly related to positive reciprocity. Moreover, <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> reciprocity was negatively related to both prosocial tendency and altruistic motivation. The results also indicated that forgiveness largely mediated the effect of <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> reciprocity on altruism. Finally, the implications and limitations of the current study were discussed...|$|R

5|$|The Great Depression {{presented}} a unique time for film-making in the United States. The economic disaster {{brought on by}} the stock market crash of 1929 changed American values and <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> various ways. Themes of American exceptionalism and traditional concepts of personal achievement, self-reliance, and the overcoming of odds lost great currency. Due to the constant empty economic reassurances from politicians {{in the early years of}} the Depression, the American public developed an increasingly jaded attitude.|$|E
5|$|The main themes {{expressed}} in the collection include how an individual's worldview (Weltanschauung) affects their actions and the attitudes of those around them, the philosophy of social determinism, and why a lack of personal responsibility for one's actions results from an individual's <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> determinism. The writing style that Dalrymple explains these in was praised by reviewers for its clear, witty prose and for going immediately to the truth and heart of any matter that is being discussed.|$|E
5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> the superiority of oral language to sign language, {{compounded by the fact}} that ASL is often glossed in English due to the lack of a standard writing system.|$|E

5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, {{in the words}} of a biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> major speeches.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beliefs</b> <b>in</b> {{the divine}} {{and in the}} afterlife were {{ingrained}} in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule {{was based on the}} divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system. These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.|$|E
5|$|Born in Greenfield, Massachusetts, George Ripley {{was pushed}} to attend Harvard College {{by his father}} and {{completed}} his studies in 1823. He went on graduate from the Harvard Divinity School {{and the next year}} married Sophia Dana. Shortly after, he became ordained as the minister of the Purchase Street Church in Boston, Massachusetts, where he began to question traditional Unitarian beliefs. He became one of the founding members of the Transcendental Club and hosted its first official meeting in his home. Shortly after, he resigned from the church to put Transcendental <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> practice by founding an experimental commune called Brook Farm. The community later converted to a model {{based on the work of}} Charles Fourier, although the community was never financially stable in either format.|$|E

50|$|André (2006) {{proposed}} {{a model of}} luck-related perceptions that includes separate positive and negative beliefs. However, she found {{the positive and negative}} components of personal luck beliefs correlate highly, suggesting they are conceptually very close or in fact the same. Maltby et al. (2008) {{proposed a}} 6-dimensional model of beliefs around luck, but empirical analyses supported only a 4-dimensional model: <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> being personally lucky; <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> being personally unlucky; general <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> luck; and rejection of <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> luck.|$|R
50|$|Thompson and Prendergast (2013) {{clarified}} {{the concepts}} of <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> luck and <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> personal luckiness. They addressed the logical problem that nobody who disbelieves in luck could consider themselves lucky by differentiating between <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> luck as a deterministic phenomenon that affects the future, on one hand, and on the other, <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> personal luckiness as an appraisal of how fortunately or otherwise chance events in the past might have turned out. They developed and validated an internationally applicable scale to measure, respectively, <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> luck and personal luckiness constructs. They found no correlation between the constructs and {{no evidence of a}} distinction between positive and negative aspects of each, suggesting they represent two discrete and unidimensional constructs. <b>Belief</b> <b>in</b> luck and personal luckiness were also found to correlate differently with personality and psychological variables, such as the Big Five and affect.|$|R
