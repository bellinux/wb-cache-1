Video games, when they are successful, are very good at challenging players. They motivate players to persevere and simultaneously teach players how to play. Gee began his work in video games by identifying thirty-six learning principles that are present in - but not exclusive to - the design of good video games. Gee argues for the application of these principles in the classroom. Gee's video game learning theory includes his identification of twelve basic learning principles.

40|$|Although the {{establishment}} of competition rules forms part of the EU’s exclusive competences, the application and enforcement of those rules has always been shared consistently between the EU and its Member States.

[...] Within these learning principles Gee shows the reader the various ways in which games and learning are linked and how each principle supports learning through gaming. One example would be Learning Principle 6: [...] "Psychosocial Moratorium" [...] Principle, where Gee explains that in games, learners can take risks in a space where real-world consequences are lowered. Another of Gee's principles, #8, that shows the importance of games and learning states that learning involves taking on and playing with identities in such a way that the learner has real choices (in developing the virtual identity) and ample opportunity to mediate on the relationship between new identities and old ones. There is tripartite play of identities as learners relate, and reflect on, their multiple real-world identities, a virtual identity, and a projective identity.|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} of relativity, as originally expressed by Galileo, {{points out that}} the area <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>principle</b> itself is that of isolated systems as well as inertial reference frames. The principle does not claim that it is always possible to isolate any physical system, indeed it leaves it open to the possibility of the existence of phenomena concerning non isolable physical systems, e. g. phenomena regulated by some non draggable ether. After the Aspect experiment realist and local models have been proposed specifically based on the hypothesis that entangled systems are not isolated. It is hypothesized that the correlations which allow the violation of Bell's inequality are due to exchanges of superluminal signals between the various parts of the system and those signals do not generate causal paradoxes because their propagation is regulated by a non draggable ether. In the present paper the perfect compatibility of such models with the relativity theory is strongly advocated. A criterion is finally proposed to determine the causal ordering between events since, when there are superluminal signals, that ordering can no longer be associated to the time ordering induced by the standard synchronization.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{seeks to}} {{establish}} a multi-layered definition {{of the principle of}} loyal cooperation in EU law in its current form. It focuses on four fundamental ways of describing this principle. The first one is a linguistic analysis of the term "principle of loyal cooperation" itself. The thesis looks at its equivalents in all official languages of the EU and applies various linguistic (etymology) and non-linguistic research tools and findings from the study of history, social psychology and philosophy to understand and delimit the principle of loyal cooperation in EU law. In a second step, the principle is examined at three separate levels. At the first level the situation and significance of the actors bound by loyalty is explored. At the second level the paper focuses on the differences between the principle of loyal cooperation, the way commitments are met in international public law, and the mechanisms of ensuring loyalty in countries with a federal structure. Lastly, the third level of analysis looks into the ways the principle of loyal cooperation and its operation vary according to the area <b>of</b> <b>competence.</b> Keywords: <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> sincere cooperation, European Union law, theory of federalism, European studie...|$|R

40|$|Projects {{play key}} roles in many modern {{industries}} and firms. The management of these economic systems, project management, is continuously developed and {{considered to be}} at the core of competitive advantage. Traditional research on project management has, however, paid scant attention to the capabilities needed for firms that depend on projects in their business operations. Furthermore, traditional work on the capabilities and <b>competence</b> <b>of</b> the firm pays limited attention to the specific traits of project processes. In the present paper, project competence is considered to be one of three strategic competencies frequently observed in modern firms. We develop an overall model for the analysis <b>of</b> project <b>competence.</b> The proposed model identifies four building <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> project <b>competence,</b> namely project generation, project organising, project leadership and teamwork. In an empirical study we elaborate on some empirical regularities in the operations of firms that to a large extent depend on projects. The companies studied are ABB, Ericsson, Skanska and Posten.

Very small amounts of iF activity were available. For this reason there were no data on nucleases occurring in iF preparations.

In the present work, due to the application of stationary-phase cell endonucleases, gel electrophoresis, and the immunological method, we found that two of these nucleases occur in Challis strain iF preparations. These two nucleases are present in larger amounts at the cell surface only in cells originating from the early-logarithmic-phase culture.

40|$|In a {{world of}} {{ever-increasing}} transnational interaction the importance to individuals of protection within transnational processes of authoritative decision correspondingly increases. The claims with which we are concerned here are those by an individual for membership in a territorial community for the purposes both of obtaining external protection against other territorial communities and of securing richer participation in the value processes of his chosen community and the world community. The traditional linkage of the individual with territorial communities for such purposes has been through the concept of nationality. Individuals {{are said to be}} the 2 ̆ 2 nationals 2 ̆ 2 of a state when that state asserts, and the larger world community honors, claims to protect and control such individuals for all the comprehensive purposes of states, as contrasted with occasional particular exercises <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> under varying <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> jurisdiction. It is, thus, of critical importance how the concept of 2 ̆ 2 nationality 2 ̆ 2 and all the ancillary rules about the conferment and withdrawal of nationality are managed in the allocation <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> among territorial communities to protect individual human beings against deprivations by other territorial communities and in determinations of what states are authorized to impose what burdens upon individuals in different value processes. In a world arena still largely state-organized, decisions about nationality may affect both {{the degree to which the}} individual person has access to a protector and the substantive content of his rights. It is a distinguishing characteristic of nation-states that they claim a special competence to impose upon their members unique burdens with respect, for example, to taxation, military service, and subjection to civil and criminal jurisdiction; how these burdens are distributed, and maximized or minimized, through assertion by one or more states, importantly affects the aggregate enjoyment of human rights by individuals...|$|R
