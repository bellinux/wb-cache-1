5|$|After {{the first}} pit stops, the Mercedes drivers had {{to manage their}} tyres in order to cover from a {{possible}} attack by Ferrari, who had an extra set of fresh tyres saved from qualifying. Rosberg however complained over the radio about Hamilton {{in front of him}} driving too slow, which caused him to back into the charging Ferraris. He was unable to risk driving too close behind Hamilton, because dispersed air from the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was accelerating tyre degradation. Hamilton was therefore asked by the team to pick up the pace.|$|E
5|$|Five months later, Wendy is on {{a subway}} train with her roommate Laura {{and her friend}} Sean. When she sees more omens she begins to get off, but sees Julie {{entering}} the car and decides to stay. Wendy notices Kevin sitting in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> The train derails, and everyone aboard shortly dies; Julie is hit by a stray wheel, and Kevin is crushed between the train and the tunnel wall. Wendy survives the crash, but is hit by another train. This {{turns out to be}} another premonition, and they attempt to stop the train. The screen goes black, followed by the sound of screeching metal.|$|E
5|$|The survivors' vehicle {{suffers a}} blowout, {{prompting}} them to swerve onto a farm. The <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, {{and he is}} rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, {{the son of a}} farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the Jaws of Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence flying through the air, which kills Rory.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} by Eddie Rickenbacker (1890-1973), America's leading fighter ace during World War I. He used his World War I 94th Fighter Squadron emblem depicting a top hat inside a ring. The emblems were located both {{on the front and}} <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Unusually trim {{levels and}} engine sizes were not liveried on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars.</b> Rather <b>the</b> trim levels were liveried on <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> by <b>the</b> Scorpio badges {{on the rear}} window frames as such. The Executive had no badge, simply the word [...] "Scorpio". Each other model had the model name under the badge, for example [...] "Scorpio Ultima." ...|$|R

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears), walking {{out of her house}} hand-in-hand with an {{unidentified}} man. The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake rolls down the window of a black Mercedes, from which he and his friend have been watching the woman. Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman across the living room. Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.|$|E
25|$|The station wagon, {{added to}} the range in November 1960, lacked the American version's {{extended}} rear overhang due to concern that the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> might scrape on rough roads and spoon drains.|$|E

50|$|In a panic, he flees, almost colliding head-on with {{a deputy}} sheriff (Ron Perlman). In <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> police <b>car,</b> he rides with the deputy {{to a crime}} scene, where police are {{excavating}} murder victims from a mass grave surrounded by abandoned vehicles. The deputy explains that this was where the rest area had been 30 years before. Dick recognizes the spot as the location where he buried the stranger. As he watches on from <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> police <b>car,</b> a deputy exhumes Gina's body and finds Dick's watch. Dick kicks his way out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patrol <b>car</b> and escapes in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nearby vehicles, leading <b>the</b> squad <b>of</b> police in a chase across the desert.|$|R
25|$|Broughton and {{the others}} {{intended}} to move the dolphin, who weighed 650lbs, 200 yards from the pool to the sea, using a ladder, a net, a home-made dolphin stretcher, and a hired Mini Metro. On {{the night of the}} action, they realised the logistics of the operation were beyond them, and decided to abandon their plans, but were arrested when the police found them with the dolphin stretcher in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Broughton, Horne, Jim O'Donnell, and Jim Buckner were fined £500, while Broughton and Horne were also given six-month suspended sentences.|$|E
25|$|During the reward, {{all three}} members of Alpha {{admitted}} that they had expected to lose the task. Their advert, which involved parents discussing {{the use of the}} tissues for their ill child, was later discussed on You're Hired as being humorously flawed on a number of points – the child being sent to school when she was ill; one parent pinching the child's nose and thus likely to spread their illness; the mother appearing dazed; and the product appearing to have been chucked out of the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and into a flower bed.|$|E
25|$|When {{the safety}} {{car and the}} drivers behind it are on the start/finish straight, there is a red light at the exit of the pit lane. Drivers who go past the red light are disqualified from the race. This has {{happened}} to several drivers during the years, such as Giancarlo Fisichella and Felipe Massa in the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix. At the same race a year later, Lewis Hamilton failed to notice the red light and slammed into the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> of Kimi Räikkönen, who {{was waiting at the}} end of the pit lane alongside Robert Kubica.|$|E

25|$|Einstein's {{version of}} the {{experiment}} presumed slightly different conditions, where a train moving past the standing observer is struck by two bolts of lightning simultaneously, but at different positions along the axis of train movement (back and front of the train car). In the inertial frame of the standing observer, there are three events which are spatially dislocated, but simultaneous: event of the standing observer facing the moving observer (i.e., {{the center of the}} train), event of lightning striking the front of the train car, and the event of lightning striking the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

25|$|Two brothers, Ronald and Lance Madison, {{fled the}} scene, but were pursued down the bridge by Gisevius and Faulcon in an unmarked state police vehicle. Faulcon fired his shotgun from the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> at Ronald, a developmentally {{disabled}} {{man who would}} later die from his injuries. The autopsy found that Ronald Madison sustained seven gunshot wounds, five of them in his back. Bowen was later convicted of stomping {{him on the back}} before he died, though this conviction was overturned for lack of physical evidence. Lance Madison was then taken into custody and charged with eight counts of attempting to kill police officers. He was held in custody for three weeks before being released without indictment.|$|E

25|$|The doors, {{most often}} {{credited}} as a Lamborghini trademark, were a remarkable design feature for the Countach. They {{first appeared on}} the Alfa Romeo 33 'Carabo' concept car in 1968, an earlier design accomplishment, also by the talented Gandini. The doors {{have come to be}} known as scissor doors: hinged at the front with horizontal hinges, so that they lifted up and tilted forwards. The main reason is the car's tubular spaceframe chassis results in very high and wide door sills. It was also partly for style, and partly because the width of the car made conventional doors impossible to use in even slightly confined space. Care needed to be taken, though, in opening the doors with a low roof overhead. The car's poor rear visibility and wide sills led to drivers adopting a method of reversing the car for parking by opening the door, sitting on the sill, and reversing while looking over the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> from outside.|$|E
25|$|But {{perhaps my}} finest memory of this lordly Frenchman came in 1966 at the Nürburgring, where a German {{official}} had been particularly rude {{to myself and}} other English journalists about going through one gate (the exit) to the press room instead of another 100 yards away (the entrance). We sat in delight, Sid Saltmarsh, Bill Long and me, not 20 yards from that 'Exit' gate, and watched as Jacques pulled up in his Ford Mustang, and proceeded to unload his bike from the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Yes, he did, not leaving it to mechanics. German official railed and cried, but all in vain. The seigniorial aspect came out oh so clearly, and Jacques did not merely ignore him, it was palpably as if the German did not exist at all. He left the car there, {{walked over to the}} riders' quarters pushing the gate open and the German with it. It has probably the finest comeuppance I shall ever see, and for that I shall remember Jacques for a long time.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Vandross first {{spotted the}} talent of Jimmy Salvemini, who was fifteen at the time, on Star Search. He thought Salvemini had the perfect voice {{for some of}} his songs, and {{contacted}} him. He was managed by his brother, Larry Salvemini. A contract was negotiated with Elektra Records for $250,000 and Vandross agreed to produce the album. He contacted his old friends Cheryl Lynn, Alfa Anderson (Chic), Phoebe Snow and Irene Cara {{to appear on the}} record. After the album was completed, Luther, Jimmy, and Larry decided to celebrate. On January 12, 1986, they were riding in Vandross's 1985 convertible Mercedes-Benz on Laurel Canyon Boulevard, in the north section of Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles. Luther was driving at 48mph in a 35mph zone when his Mercedes veered across the double yellow center line of the two lane street, turned sideways and collided with the front of a 1972 Mercury Marquis that was headed southbound, then swung around and hit a 1979 Cadillac Seville head on. Vandross and Jimmy were rushed to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Larry, who was in the passenger seat, was killed during the collision. Vandross suffered three broken ribs, a broken hip, several bruises and facial cuts. Jimmy, who was in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> had cuts, bruises and contusions. Vandross faced vehicular manslaughter charges as a result of Larry's death, and his driving license was suspended for a year. There was no evidence Vandross was {{under the influence of alcohol}} or other drugs; he pleaded no contest to reckless driving. At first, the Salvemini family was supportive of Vandross, but later filed a wrongful death suit against him. The case was settled out of court with a payment to the Salvemini family for about $630,000. Jimmy Salvemini's album, Roll It, was released later that year.|$|E

Its wheels are 18 inches (457 mm) in diameter. It has an IEEE 802.11g compliant wireless LAN hub. The SYNus {{was designed to}} maximize safety, and derives its aesthetic from modern bank vaults. <b>The</b> <b>car's</b> windows and frame are bullet-resistant. It has no rear window, and instead displays a video feed on a large LCD monitor installed in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> interior.

[...] The friend also said that Manning's home life was not good and that her father was very controlling. Around this time, Manning's parents divorced. She and her mother Susan moved out of the house to a rented apartment in Crescent, Oklahoma. Susan's instability continued, and in 1998 she attempted suicide; Manning's sister drove their mother to the hospital, with the 11-year-old Manning sitting in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> trying to make sure their mother was still breathing.|$|E
500|$|Randy Marsh, {{determined}} {{to make sure his}} son Stan win the annual statewide pinewood derby, slips an object into the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to give it an advantage. Stan learns from a news report that the object is a superconducting magnet, stolen from the Large Hadron Collider by Randy disguised as Princess Leia. During the finals, Randy coaxes Stan to lie to the judges and say he used only the parts in the approved pinewood derby kit. Stan wins first place when his car reaches warp speed, shooting off the track and into space, where it is later found by an alien species. Soon after, a spaceship lands in South Park, but its pilot is a bank robber named [...] "Baby Fark McGee-zax" [...] who demands that Stan and Randy build him a new warp drive while holding the entire planet at gunpoint. Everyone believes Stan and his father can create the drive using only the approved pinewood derby kit.|$|E
500|$|Murray {{designed}} a version {{driven by a}} complex series of clutches running from the engine to a large single fan at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Therefore, the faster the engine ran, the stronger the suction effect. Like the Lotus, it had sliding [...] "skirts" [...] that sealed {{the gap between the}} sides of the cars and the ground. These prevented excessive air from being sucked into the low pressure area under the car and dissipating the ground effect. There was a rule banning [...] "moveable aerodynamic devices", but the fan also drew air through a horizontally mounted radiator over the engine. Using a fan to assist cooling was legal—Brabham had used a small electric fan to this effect on the BT45Cs at the South American races {{at the start of the}} year—and Brabham claimed that this was the primary effect of the new device. These claims were lent some legitimacy by the cooling system design issues that had affected the original design at the start of the year.|$|E
