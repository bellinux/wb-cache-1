5|$|Gauguin {{first visited}} Tahiti in 1891, and {{attracted}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of Tahitian women undertook {{a set of}} sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived.|$|E

As {{one of the three}} acts of reparation performed by the Æsir for Þjazi's death, Skaði was allowed by the Æsir to choose a husband from amongst them, but given the stipulation that she may not see any part of them but their feet when making the selection. Expecting to choose the god Baldr <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of the feet she selects, Skaði instead finds that she has picked Njörðr.|$|E

25|$|The general {{style of}} works of the Cosmati school is {{more closely related to}} Romanesque art, even though some of the {{buildings}} they worked in are Gothic, as in their main lines are their larger structures, especially in the elaborate altar-canopies, with their pierced geometrical tracery. In detail, however, they differ widely from the purer Gothic of northern countries. The richness of effect which the English or French architect obtained by elaborate and carefully worked mouldings was produced in Italy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of polished marbles and jewel-like mosaics; the details being mostly rather coarse and often carelessly executed.|$|E

Both maidens possess such beauty that flowers grow beneath their feet when they come to meet the heroes for the first time, as if they were living embodiments of spring.|$|E

25|$|Heraclea is {{generally}} regarded as the native country of the celebrated painter Zeuxis, though there is much doubt to which of the numerous cities of the name that distinguished artist really owed his birth. But the flourishing state {{of the arts in}} the Lucanian Heraclea (in common with most of the neighbouring cities of Magna Graecia) is attested <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> and variety of its coins, some of which may deservedly be reckoned among the choicest specimens of Greek art; while their number sufficiently proves the opulence and commercial activity of the city to which they belong.|$|E
25|$|Bai Tho Mountain is a {{limestone}} mountain formation, which {{rises to}} {{a height of}} 106 meters, {{right in the middle}} of the Hạ Long City. It appears like a giant castle with three towers of the undulating rock. Another famous mountain is the That Bai Tho Mountain, which was earlier called the Transmission Mount(Then). It has historical linkage to the visit of Emperor Lê Thánh Tông to the provincial city in 1468. The emperor was moved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of the mountain covered with clouds, called it a young fairy of Hạ Long and got a poem written on it and engraved on the southern side of the rocky cliff. In 1729, Lord Trịnh Cương did a painting and poem on Emperor Lê Thánh Tông on this mountain.|$|E
25|$|Mary, well-educated and unusually curious in an {{era when}} a woman's primary focus is keeping house and {{attending}} to the needs of her family, surprises Charles with the depth of her interest and ability and becomes his assistant. He is delighted to find a kindred spirit in his isolation, and the admiration she feels soon turns to passion that he reciprocates. While secretly observing Passover in her room, she spills salt water onto one of Charles' prints, accidentally discovering a technique that preserves the image. The next morning she rushes to the laboratory to tell Charles, and their excitement spills over into making love for the first time. But he becomes increasingly consumed with the race to publish their new process, while she is captivated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of the photographs they create.|$|E

25|$|This chronicle is {{his major}} legacy, {{providing}} contemporary detail on events in Wales, England and abroad and {{an insight into}} the life of an educated man moving through important spheres of influence at the time. He met Kings and Popes, chronicles the Peasants' Revolt (the chronicle opens with a description of Jack Straw) and Emperor Manuel II's Christmas visit to Richard II, lived in various cities and towns but was often on the move. Observant of phenomena from his youth, Adam is struck <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of the Lake of Lucerne and the quality of Beaune wine, but draws a pessimistic conclusion about the night-time behaviour of Rome's canine population. He offered a useful interpretation of the history of his times. The chronicle throws particular light on the Glyndŵr revolt. The interest of the content is generally far superior to the Latinity of the work.|$|E
25|$|However, Charlotte did {{not allow}} herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, {{coincidence}} came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone {{in the dining room}} she noticed a small notebook lying open on in the drawer of Emily's portable writing desk and of my sister Emily's handwriting. She read it and was dazzled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that she had felt, more than surprise , a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music – wild, melancholy, and elevating. In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to calm down and days to be convinced to publish the poems.|$|E
25|$|Vladimir {{had been}} prince of Novgorod {{when his father}} Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his {{half-brother}} Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, {{with the help of}} his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the Byzantine Rite was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry Princess Anna, the sister of Byzantine emperor Basil II.|$|E

500|$|Some {{regional}} deities {{are also}} identified as Shiva's children.

In outskirts of Ernakulam in Kerala, a deity named Vishnumaya is stated to be offspring of Shiva and invoked in local exorcism rites, but this deity is not traceable in Hindu pantheon and is possibly a local tradition with [...] "vaguely Chinese" [...] style rituals, states Saletore. In some traditions, Shiva has daughters like the serpent-goddess Manasa and Ashokasundari. According to Doniger, two regional stories depict demons Andhaka and Jalandhara as the children of Shiva who war with him, and are later destroyed by Shiva.|$|E

Charles Taylor of Salon commented [...] "The movie was shot by Shane Hurlbut and none of the shots call attention to themselves. Instead you're struck <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> of watching a row of drummers' hands as they blur with the rhythm their sticks are beating out."
