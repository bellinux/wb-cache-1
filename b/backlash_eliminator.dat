5000|$|Climb milling (right): Each tooth {{engages the}} {{material}} at a definite point, and {{the width of}} the cut starts at the maximum and decreases to zero. The chips are disposed behind the cutter, leading to easier swarf removal. The tooth does not rub on the material, and so tool life may be longer. However, climb milling can apply larger loads to the machine, and so is not recommended for older milling machines, or machines which are not in good condition. This type of milling is used predominantly on mills with a <b>backlash</b> <b>eliminator.</b>|$|E
50|$|Gear {{teeth with}} slop (backlash) exhibit deadband. There is no {{drive from the}} input to the output shaft in either {{direction}} while the teeth are not meshed. Leadscrews generally also have backlash and hence a deadband, which {{must be taken into}} account when making position adjustments, especially with CNC systems. If mechanical <b>backlash</b> <b>eliminators</b> are not available, the control can compensate for backlash by adding the deadband value to the position vector whenever direction is reversed.|$|R
5000|$|C-frame mill These are larger, {{industrial}} production mills. They feature a knee and fixed spindle head {{that is only}} mobile vertically. They are typically much more powerful than a turret mill, featuring a separate hydraulic motor for integral hydraulic power feeds in all directions, and a twenty to fifty horsepower motor. <b>Backlash</b> <b>eliminators</b> are almost always standard equipment. They use large NMTB 40 or 50 tooling. The tables on C-frame mills are usually 18" [...] by 68" [...] or larger, to allow multiple parts to be machined at the same time.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of sound and vibration and the definitive version is available at [URL] rattle phenomenon in vehicular transmissions {{and its impact on}} the automotive industry have been widely reported in the literature. A variety of palliative measures have been suggested for attenuation of rattle such as use of <b>backlash</b> <b>eliminators,</b> clutch dampers or dual-mass flywheels. These palliative measures incur further costs and can have untoward implications in powertrain noise and vibration problems. A fundamental investigation of the dynamics of impacting gears is undoubtedly the way forward for a root cause solution. This paper introduces a new approach for understanding the interactions between the transmission gears during engine idle conditions by taking into account the effect of lubrication. Gear impacting surfaces are treated as lubricated conjunctions rather than the usually reported dry impacting solids. Depending on load and speed of entraining motion of the lubricant into the contact domains, the regime of lubrication alters. In this paper, the influence of lubricant in torsional vibration of lightly loaded idling gears is examined which promotes iso-viscous hydrodynamic conditions. It is shown that the lubricant film under these conditions behaves as a time-varying non-linear spring-damper element. Spectral analysis of the system response is compared to the findings of the linearised system...|$|R
