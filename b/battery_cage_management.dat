The extensive system of rearing chicken for egg is old and still remained the most popular in the study area. Commercial eggs production was carried out on a large scale by the few farmers who practiced the intensive (battery cage) chicken management system. A significant (p < 0. 05) and high degree of positive relationship (r = 0. 70) was found between chicken management system and level of egg production. Majority of the farmers would require general education, fund and technical training in poultry production to enable them adopt the intensive (<b>battery</b> <b>cage)</b> <b>management</b> system of rearing chickens for egg production. Mostly local chickens were reared under the extensive system. No matter the popularity, the extensive system of rearing chickens lacks the potential for increased egg production. Egg protein is regarded as luxury to the extent that children who consume eggs are regarded as thieves among most of the poor in Nigeria. More poultry farmers need to embrace the intensive (battery cage) system {{in order to meet the}} egg protein needs of the people of Delta State, Nigeria...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} free-range versus cage {{management}} system on corticosterone transfer into the eggs was studied in laying hens. Hungarian Yellow laying hens (age: 21 weeks, body weight: 2. 0 ± 0. 5 kg) {{were divided into}} two groups in the spring: Group I, free-range keeping (n = 15 layers, density: ≯ 0. 5 bird/m 2) in outdoor runs, with continuous access to a commercial layer feed; Group II, hens kept in battery cages (n = 17 layers, density: 2 birds/m 2, natural light, continuous access to feed and water). Eggs were collected after a one-week adaptation period on days 2, 7 and 16. Corticosterone (CST) was extracted from homogenised egg samples using an ASE- 200 Accelerated Solvent Extractor and then assayed by liquid chromatography linked with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) [Thermo Quest Surveyor high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) interfaced via Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionisation (APCI) ion source to Finnigan/Thermo Quest LCQ Deca MS/MS] using dexamethasone as internal standard with positive APCI ionisation. CST concentrations of whole eggs laid by free-range hens on days 2, 7 and 16 were 0. 370 ± 0. 218, 0. 259 ± 0. 066 and 0. 915 ± 0. 745 ng·g- 1, respectively, while those of eggs laid by caged hens were 0. 206 ± 0. 157, 0. 223 ± 0. 165 and 0. 184 ± 0. 110 ng·g- 1 at the above sampling times. It is concluded that in free-range laying hens the sharp changes of environmental weather conditions significantly increased the corticosterone content of eggs, while the environmentally controlled and closed <b>battery</b> <b>cage</b> <b>management</b> technology resulted in relatively uniform corticosterone concentrations in the whole eggs. ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Battery</b> <b>cages</b> are {{a housing}} system used for various animal {{production}} methods, but primarily for egg-laying hens. The name {{arises from the}} arrangement of rows and columns of identical cages connected together, sharing common divider walls, as in the cells of a battery. Although the term is usually applied to poultry farming, similar cage systems are used for other animals. <b>Battery</b> <b>cages</b> have generated controversy between advocates for animal rights, and industrial producers. <b>Battery</b> <b>cages</b> are the predominant form of housing for laying hens worldwide. They reduce aggression and cannibalism among hens, but are barren, restrict movement, prevent many natural behaviours, and increase rates of osteoporosis. As of 2014, approximately 95% of eggs in the US were produced in battery cages.In the UK, statistics from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) indicate that 50% of eggs produced in the UK throughout 2010 were from cages (45% from free-range, 5% from barns). [...] However, introduction of the European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC which banned conventional <b>battery</b> <b>cages</b> in the EU from January 2012 for welfare reasons, means the number of eggs from <b>battery</b> <b>cages</b> in the EU states is rapidly decreasing.|$|R

40|$|In Switzerland eggs {{have not}} been {{produced}} in <b>battery</b> <b>cages</b> since January 1992. During the 10 year period from 1981 farmers replaced their <b>battery</b> <b>cages</b> with deep litter, aviary and grid-floor systems and modified cages. However, the cages used to replace the conventional <b>battery</b> <b>cages</b> {{and most of the}} grid- floor systems did not fulfil the requirements of the Swiss Welfare Act and they were not permitted to be advertised or sold thereafter. Sixteen years after the ban on <b>battery</b> <b>cages,</b> the Federal Veterinary Office has undertaken a survey to determine how laying hens are kept in Switzerland and how the alternative systems have fared. The survey was carried out on 96 randomly chosen farms with at least 500 hen places {{to find out more about}} the housing conditions, management processes, status and performance of hens. The results show that aviaries are very common in Switzerland (65 % of the laying hens) and that the laying performance in these systems is significantly higher than that in grid- floor systems and similar to that in <b>battery</b> <b>cages.</b> Provision of a protected outdoor area is a valuable benefit. To be successful with aviary systems it is necessary for pullets to spend the rearing period under similar housing condition...|$|R

40|$|Three {{different}} production environments {{were evaluated}} for {{their impact on}} laying hen reproduction by assessing the ovary and oviducts {{for the presence of}} physiological variations. The three environments included free-range (FR = 60), cage-free (CF = 55) and <b>battery</b> <b>cage</b> (BC = 50). The ovaries and oviducts from these hens were collected and weighed during necropsy, then stored in a freezer at - 20 °F for later analysis. The analysis included the oviduct length and the number of Post-Ovulatory Follicles (POFs), atretic follicles, hierarchical follicles (H = 12 - 40 mm), small yellow follicles (SY = 5 - 12 mm), large white follicles (LW = 2 - 5 mm), small white follicles (SW = < 2 mm) and tumor numbers if present on each ovary. Free-range hens had significantly heavier oviduct weights, at 19. 4 and 13. 5 % heavier than oviducts of <b>battery</b> <b>cage</b> and cage-free hens, respectively. The free-range hens also exhibited an increased presence of tumors as well as an increased frequency of multiple tumors on the oviducts. Hens housed in the free-range and <b>battery</b> <b>cage</b> environments had increased numbers of LW follicles compared to the cage-free hens. In addition, the free-range hens had a significantly smaller number of SW follicles when compared to the <b>battery</b> <b>cage</b> hens. Contrary to the popular belief that birds raised in free-range or cage-free environments provide healthier production alternatives than conventional <b>battery</b> <b>cages,</b> this study does not suggest that there is a significant physiological impact on the reproductive capacity of hens housed in these different production environments. However, oviduct health appears to be better in the <b>battery</b> <b>cage</b> and cage-free environments...|$|R
