25|$|Birkeland {{currents}} {{are also}} one of a class of plasma phenomena called a z-pinch, so named because the azimuthal magnetic fields produced by the current pinches the current into a filamentary cable. This can also twist, producing a helical pinch that spirals like a twisted or <b>braided</b> <b>rope,</b> and this most closely corresponds to a Birkeland current. Pairs of parallel Birkeland currents will also interact due to Ampère's force law: parallel Birkeland currents moving {{in the same direction}} will attract each other with an electromagnetic force inversely proportional to their distance apart whilst parallel Birkeland currents moving in opposite directions will repel each other. There is also a short-range circular component to the force between two Birkeland currents that is opposite to the longer-range parallel forces.|$|E
500|$|From the Second Punic War {{until the}} 3rd century AD, {{the bulk of}} Rome's light cavalry (apart from mounted archers from Syria) was {{provided}} by the inhabitants of the Maghrebi provinces of Africa and Mauretania Caesariensis, the Numidae or Mauri (from whom derives the English term [...] "Moors"), who were the ancestors of the Berber people of modern Algeria and Morocco. They were known as the equites Maurorum or Numidarum ("Moorish or Numidian cavalry"). On Trajan's Column, Mauri horsemen, depicted with long hair in dreadlocks, are shown riding their small but resilient horses bare-back and unbridled, with a simple <b>braided</b> <b>rope</b> round their mount's neck for control. They wear no body or head armour, carrying only a small, round leather shield. Their weaponry cannot be discerned due to stone erosion, but is known from Livy to have consisted of several short javelins. Exceptionally fast and maneuverable, Numidian cavalry would harass the enemy by hit-and-run attacks, riding up and loosing volleys of javelins, then scattering faster than any opposing cavalry could pursue. They were superbly suited to scouting, harassment, ambush and pursuit. It is unclear what proportion of the Numidian cavalry were regular auxilia units as opposed to irregular foederati units.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTwist may be {{introduced}} accidentally into <b>braided</b> <b>ropes</b> during operations at sea, {{and it is}} important to know how this will affect both rope integrity and safety coefficients. This paper describes the use of simulation tools to evaluate how twisting can change the tensile properties of <b>braided</b> <b>ropes.</b> The case of a 300 kN break load 12 strand <b>braided</b> HMPE <b>rope</b> is examined. An original numerical modelling approach is presented, and results are compared with results from tensile tests performed on ropes with different levels of twist. A drop in strength of around 4 % per turn per meter, and an increase in elongation, were observed as the number of turns per meter increased, corresponding to progressive removal of the load-bearing capacity of half the braided strands. The model shows how load is progressively redistributed within the braid. However, very high twist levels (> 10 T/m) are required to reduce strength below 50 % of the initial value...|$|R

50|$|While rope may be {{made from}} three or more strands, modern <b>braided</b> <b>rope</b> {{consists}} of a braided (tubular) jacket over strands of fiber (these may also be braided). Some forms of <b>braided</b> <b>rope</b> with untwisted cores have a particular advantage; they do not impart an additional twisting force when they are stressed. The lack of added twisting forces is an advantage when a load is freely suspended, as when a rope is used for rappelling or to suspend an arborist. Other specialized cores reduce the shock from arresting a fall when used {{as a part of}} a personal or group safety system.|$|E
50|$|The {{twist of}} the strands in a twisted or <b>braided</b> <b>rope</b> serves {{not only to}} keep a rope together, but enables the rope to more evenly {{distribute}} tension among the individual strands.

50|$|The primary {{piece of}} {{equipment}} used is the bull rope. The bull rope is a <b>braided</b> <b>rope</b> made of polypropylene, grass, or some combination. A handle is braided {{into the center of}} the rope and is usually stiffened with leather. One side of the rope is tied in an adjustable knot that can be changed for the size of bull. The other side of the rope (the tail) is a flat braid and is usually coated with rosin to keep it from sliding through the rider's hand. A metallic bell is strapped to the knot and hangs directly under the bull throughout the ride. In addition to the sound the bell produces, it also gives the rope some weight, allowing it to fall off the bull once a rider has dismounted.|$|E

The sculptures decorating the tower represent a repertoire of ornamental motifs, geometrical and vegetal - uncommon for the epoch of Michael the Brave and Petru Rareş. The interior consists of the portico, the bema, the nave and the altar. The portico is elevated above the churchyard; from the portico to the altar, seven steps enhance the feeling of ascent and differentiate among the chambers of the church. A lace of ribs covers the vaults, a western Gothic style, here used in artistic interpretation by the Metropolitan himself. The motif of the <b>braided</b> <b>rope</b> is found on almost every surface of the vault, arches and intersections with walls. Dragomirna has no funerary chamber; there are five tombs in the portico {{and one in the}} bema. The latter may be that of the chief founder, metropolitan Anastasie Crimca.|$|E
50|$|<b>Braided</b> <b>ropes</b> are {{generally}} made from nylon, polyester, polypropylene or high performance fibers {{such as high}} modulus polyethylene (HMPE) and aramid. Nylon is chosen for its strength and elastic stretch properties. However, nylon absorbs water and is 10-15% weaker when wet. Polyester is about 90% as strong as nylon but stretches less under load and is not affected by water. It has somewhat better UV resistance, and is more abrasion resistant. Polypropylene is preferred for low cost and light weight (it floats on water) but it has limited resistance to ultraviolet light, is susceptible to friction and has a poor heat resistance.|$|R
