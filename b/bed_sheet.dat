In 1937, Electric 'overblankets which lie {{on top of the}} sleeping person were introduced in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The literal commandment in {{the bible}} was not to wear a tallit but to attach tzitzit to the corners of one's four-cornered garments, {{implying}} that such clothes were worn in any event by people of the region. Such garments were large, white and rectangular and used a garment, <b>bed</b> <b>sheet,</b> and burial shroud. These four-cornered garments may have developed from similar garments suitable for the climate of West Asia where typically the days are hot and the garment can be draped around the body and head to provide cover from the sun or just bunched up on the shoulders for later evening use; the evenings can be dramatically cool and the garment could be draped around the neck and shoulders like a scarf to provide warmth. Such garments continue to be worn today in the region, for instance the Bedouin square-form abbaya.|$|E

500|$|While {{filming the}} {{introductory}} scene of Karthik's character, Manohar, Sreeram {{had to lie}} on a <b>bed</b> <b>sheet</b> to film.

500|$|The {{women and}} {{children}} contributed {{to a sense of}} normality as their presence provided conventional social, family, and gender relations. [...] The internees believed the children's presence made them less selfish, as it forced them to think of the latter's welfare. The women organised Christmas and birthday celebrations. Other diversions such as musicals, plays, recitals, and variety shows were also staged. Although the camp lacked books and educational supplies, the teachers and educational administrators amongst the internees were able to provide lessons for the children at the primary and secondary levels. Additionally, extensive educational opportunities were available for the adults: language courses for Chinese, Malay, and French, and also lectures on photography, yachting, journalism, and poultry-keeping. In addition to the personal diaries kept by internees, many of them now held by the Imperial War Museum, a record of life in the camp was created using a double <b>bed</b> <b>sheet.</b> The Day Joyce Sheet was embroidered and appliquéd with 1100 names, signs and figures including a diary in code.|$|E

A detective was asked why the <b>bed</b> <b>sheet</b> had not been tested.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} other {{variations}} on male masturbation techniques. Men may also rub or massage the glans, {{the rim of the}} glans, and the frenular delta. Some men place both hands directly on their penis during masturbation, while others may use their free hand to fondle their testicles, nipples, or other parts of their body. [...] The nipples are erogenous zones, and vigorous stimulation of them during masturbation usually causes the penis to become erect more quickly than it would otherwise. [...] Some may keep their hand stationary while pumping into it with pelvic thrusts in order to simulate the motions of sexual intercourse. Some may lay in the prone position and rub their genitals against the <b>bed</b> <b>sheet</b> or other surface, a technique called prone masturbation. [...] Others may also use vibrators and other sexual devices more commonly associated with female masturbation. A few extremely flexible males can reach and stimulate their penis with their tongue or lips, and so perform autofellatio.|$|E
