After {{joining forces}} with fellow musician, Norah Chambers, a {{graduate}} of the Royal Academy of Music in London, the pair formed a camp choir. Dryburgh wrote down pages of music from memory, from baroque to contemporary, for the Vocal Orchestra to perform, as well as pieces of her own light classical compositions. The music was arranged in four parts, which were hummed by the women to give the effect of an orchestra, and included pieces by Handel, Chopin, Brahms and Beethoven. Even the Japanese soldiers were said to <b>be</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> what they heard, inviting themselves to the concerts. The Captives' Hymn was one of the pieces written by Dryburgh, and was sung each Sunday during church services.|$|E

Rock, a fan of West's, mused that he was more than happy to {{collaborate}} with West, and said, [...] "you'd <b>be</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> how many people want to work with you if you just ask, if you just make a call." [...] He had previously collaborated on other hip hop songs, such as with rappers Ludacris, Ol' Dirty Bastard, and Ice Cube on the track [...] "You Ain't Gotta Lie (Ta Kick It)". Rock described his collaboration with West as exciting in nature, commenting that he was always open to working on unusual ventures. In an interview with The New York Times, Rock went into detail about the composition of the song: ...|$|E
500|$|Paste {{magazine}} writer Brent Koepp {{called it}} [...] "another incredible episode" [...] {{and said the}} impending conflict between Walter and Gus [...] "has the makings of one of television's finest showdowns". He also said the script made good use of the supporting characters, and that the growing distance between Hank and Marie was particularly well handled. Matt Seitz of Salon.com compared [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] to excellent third season episodes that had [...] "very few scenes and sequences but luxuriated in them, allowing the characters (and the viewer) time to experience the tiny eddies and currents of the moment". He also called an overhead shot of Walter standing outside Gus' house alone [...] "one of the best shots in the show's history". Tim Surette of TV.com especially praised the scene with Walter approaching Gus' house, writing: [...] "Breaking Bad has always been good at creating an air of tension, but now {{it seems as though}} the series has mastered it. He also said Paul's acting during Jesse's emotional breakdown [...] "ripped my heart out and shredded it to pieces". The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman said the photography and direction during Jesse's party scenes was masterful: [...] "Here we are four seasons into Breaking Bad and I shouldn't still <b>be</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the innovated visuals or perfectly honed sense of sound. These are masters at work, people." [...] Slate writers Jessica Grose and June Thomas both enjoyed the episode, although they found Walter's character increasingly difficult to sympathize with. Both praised the scene when Mike attacked Walter, while Grose especially enjoyed Aaron Paul's performance and Skyler's subplot.|$|E

The event was also applauded by past Republican presidential contenders, including former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty, and Senator John McCain.

Any one who knows Grecian history as it can now be known, will <b>be</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> M.

One would have thought that, by mere chance, in this or the other element of griffin, the griffin-composer might have struck out a truth; that he might have had the luck to set the ears back, or to give some grasp to the claw. But, no; from beginning to end it is evidently impossible for him to be anything but wrong; his whole soul is instinct with lies; no veracity can come within hail of him; to him, all regions of right and life are for ever closed.|$|E
6000|$|It was a red-letter day to us {{children}} when, {{about once}} a month, we were packed into a trap and driven with our parents to spend a day at Casa Antigua.

60|$|And, indeed, I am so {{far from}} {{thinking}} this libel to be born of several fathers, that it hath been the wonder of several others, as well as myself; how {{it was possible for}} any man, who appeareth to have gone the common circle of academical education;[2] who hath taken so universal a liberty, and hath so entirely laid aside all regards, not only of Christianity, but common truth and justice; one who is dead to all sense of shame, and seemeth to be past the getting or losing a reputation, should, with so many advantages, and upon so unlimited a subject, come out with so poor, so jejune a production.

60|$|But {{this was}} when his mind was in its most distracted state. In all the other phases of its illness, and in those to which it was most constant, it always turned on Florence.

Then, confounding that time with the later days of the many footsteps, he would <b>be</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> their number, and begin to count them as he followed her. Here, of a sudden, was a bloody footstep going on among the others; and after it there began to be, at intervals, doors standing open, through which certain terrible pictures were seen, in mirrors, of haggard men, concealing something in their breasts. Still, among the many footsteps and the bloody footsteps here and there, was the step of Florence. Still she was going on before. Still the restless mind went, following and counting, ever farther, ever higher, as to the summit of a mighty tower that it took years to climb.|$|E

His Lordship had gain'd the Love of all by a Thousand {{engaging}} Condescensions; even his Gallantries being no way prejudicial, were not offensive; and though his Lordships did his utmost to conceal his Chagrin, the Sympathy of those around him made such Discoveries upon him, as would have disappointed a double Portion of his Caution. They had seen him un-elated under Successes, that were so near being unaccountable, that in a Country of less Superstition than Spain, they might almost have pass'd for miraculous; they knew full well, that nothing, but that Series of Successes had pav'd a Passage for the General that was to supersede him; those only having removed all the Difficulties of his March from Portugal to Madrid; they knew him the older General; and therefore not knowing, that in the Court he came from, Intrigue was too often the Soul of Merit, they could not but <b>be</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> a Change, which his Lordship was unwilling any body should perceive by himself.|$|E
6000|$|Third, The Father's {{giving of}} them to him, to save them, {{declares}} that he is, and will be gentle, and patient towards them, under all their provocations and miscarriages. It {{is not to be}} imagined, the trials and provocations that the Son of God hath all along had with these people that have been given to him that saves them: indeed he is said to be [...] "a tried stone;" [...] for he has been tried, not only by the devil, guilt of sin, death, and the curse of the law, but also by his people's ignorance, unruliness, falls into sin, and declining to errors in life and doctrine. Were we but capable of seeing how this Lord Jesus has been tried even by his people, ever since there was one of them in the world, we should <b>be</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> his patience and gentle carriages to them. It is said, indeed, [...] "The Lord is very pitiful, slow to anger, and of great mercy." [...] And, indeed, if he had not been so, he could never have endured their manners as he has done from Adam hitherto. Therefore is his pity and bowels towards his church preferred above the pity and bowels of a mother towards her child.

60|$|Use Third. Is Christ Jesus {{not only}} a priest of, and a King over, but an Advocate for his people? Let this make us stand and wonder, and <b>be</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> his humiliation and condescension. We read of his humiliation on earth when he put himself into our flesh, took upon him our sins, and made them as his own unto {{condemnation}} and death. And to be an advocate is an office reproachful to the malicious, if any man be such an one, for those that are base and unworthy. Yea, and the higher and more honourable the person is that pleads for such, the more he humbles himself. The word doth often in effect account him now in heaven as a servant for us, and acts of service are acts of condescension; and I am sure some acts of service have more of that in them than some; and I think when all things are considered, that Christ neither doth nor can do anything for us there, of a more condescending nature, than to become our Advocate. True, he glories in it; but that doth not show that the work is excellent in itself. It {{is also one of}} his titles of honour; but that is to show how highly God esteems of, and dignifies all his acts; and though this shall tend at last to the greatening of his honour and glory in his kingdom, yet the work itself is amazingly mean.|$|E
