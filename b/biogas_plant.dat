25|$|Centralized {{wastewater}} treatment {{systems can be}} costly and {{use a lot of}} energy. An alternative to this process is converting waste and wastewater into fertilizer, which avoids these costs and shows other benefits. By collecting human waste at the source and running it to a semi-centralized <b>biogas</b> <b>plant</b> with other biological waste, liquid fertilizer can be produced. This concept was demonstrated by a settlement in Lubeck Germany in the late 1990s. Practices like these provide soil with organic nutrients and create carbon sinks that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, offsetting greenhouse gas emission. Producing artificial fertilizer is also more costly in energy than this process.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: EU {{policy has}} {{improved}} {{the legal framework}} conditions for energy production from renewable sources. Therefore the number of <b>biogas</b> <b>plants</b> {{and the application of}} energy crops increased considerably during the last few years. Still, a big discrepancy can be seen between the theoretically available and the actually utilised biogas potential. An optimisation of the efficiency along the whole process chain from the substrate input over technology, process control, digestate utilisation up to energy conversion is necessary to promote the very promising potentials of biogas. The increased use of energy crops induced adaptations in digester, feeding, and mixer technologies {{as well as in the}} process control. A new generation of modern <b>biogas</b> <b>plants</b> is the result of this development. An area-wide monitoring of Austrian farm-based <b>biogas</b> <b>plants</b> assessed the current state of the art. Data on biogas technology, substance and energy flows, economic efficiency, work requirement and management of the <b>biogas</b> <b>plants</b> were collected. From these data, a clear picture on the current state of the art and of the performance of <b>biogas</b> <b>plants</b> can be drawn...|$|R
40|$|<b>Biogas</b> <b>plants</b> {{are one of}} the {{important}} elements in the Danish energy-policy of having reduced CO 2 emissions by 20 % by 2005. Since 1984, development efforts concerning centralised <b>biogas</b> <b>plants</b> in Denmark have been carried out, and Denmark now has approximately 20 large centralised <b>biogas</b> <b>plants.</b> All Danish <b>biogas</b> <b>plants</b> have increased gas production as a result of admixing industrial organic wastes with manure. This is predominantly regarded as a great advantage for both <b>biogas</b> <b>plants</b> and waste suppliers. The paper will describe the technological development of this renewable energy source in terms of biogas production prices. The price has dropped dramatically during the last 15 years. Based on this analysis, the paper discusses the socio-economic costs of technology development including state budget and employment effects. Also the paper refers to socio-economic feasibility studies from the early 1990 s, when biogas production prices were much higher than natural gas.
