5|$|The sepoys {{were also}} accused {{of not being}} able to adjust and adapt to the living {{conditions}} in their new environment. While in India, the sepoys would have a constant supply of goat meat and milk but because it was difficult to receive a constant supply of goat in Singapore, the sepoys had to make do with a substitute – chicken - and very little milk. The sepoys resorted to <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> own meat and milk to make up for the insufficient amount they received and the use of the dollar versus the rupee irked them further.|$|E
25|$|The mission {{aimed at}} {{establishing}} an intelligence-gathering base in Mandatory Palestine, radioing information back to Germany, and recruiting and arming anti-British Palestinians by <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> support with gold.

25|$|AKFED {{provides}} a living {{for millions of}} people, in particular in the agribusiness sector. For Example, AKFED developed green bean farming in Kenya by providing 50,000 farmers with technical assistance and <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> produce for export to Europe. The company has 2,000 employees, turns a profit, and indirectly {{provides a}} living for 500,000 people.|$|E
50|$|LDCs {{normally}} <b>buy</b> <b>their</b> {{power from}} larger companies, sometimes ones dedicated solely to wholesale supply. They re-sell {{it to the}} smaller customer. Larger customers typically <b>buy</b> <b>their</b> power directly from the wholesaler, and do not use the LDC.|$|R

25|$|The Low Country {{was settled}} first, {{dominated}} by wealthy English men who became owners of {{large amounts of}} land on which they established plantations. They first transported white indentured servants as laborers, mostly teenage youth from England who came to work off their passage in hopes of learning to farm and <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> own land. Planters also imported African laborers to the colony.|$|E
25|$|Crooks: Crooks, {{the black}} stable-hand, gets {{his name from}} his crooked back. Proud, bitter, and cynical, he is {{isolated}} from the other men {{because of the color}} of his skin. Despite himself, Crooks becomes fond of Lennie, and though he claims to have seen countless men following empty dreams of <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> own land, he asks Lennie if he can go with them and hoe in the garden.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, {{a drop in}} {{the number}} of Chinese donkeys, {{combined}} with {{the fact that they are}} slow to reproduce, meant that Chinese suppliers began to look to Africa. As a result of the increase in demand, and the price that could be charged, Kenya opened three donkey abattoirs. Concerns for donkey's wellbeing, however, have resulted in a number of African countries (including Uganda, Tanzania, Botswana, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal) banning China from <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> donkey products.|$|E

Pete is the latest resident of the apartment above Montoni's (Les and Lisa lived there before <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> home. Becky and Wally took it over, and then apparently during the time jump John and Becky lived there together before John {{turned it into a}} storage space for his comics, probably since the basement shop has flooded in the past).|$|E
25|$|The Geophysical Institute of Tromsø {{established}} a geophysical station at Kvadehuken in 1920, although it only remained in operation until 1924. Production {{rose through the}} 1920, reaching a peak 99,000 tonnes per year. Coal liquefaction was attempted from 1924 to 1927, but proved unprofitable. The labor union, Kings Bay Arbeiderforening, was founded in 1925, {{although many of the}} workers had previously ad-hoc organized themselves. In 1919 Northern Exploration Company laid pressed that they had claims on Blomstrandhalvøya. The case ended with the Government of Norway <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> claims in 1925, parts of which were sold to Kings Bay.|$|E
25|$|All {{services}} {{from the station}} are operated by ScotRail. The most frequent services are on the electrified route between Glasgow Central and Ayr on the Ayrshire Coast Line. Trains run every 15 minutes during day-time hours Monday to Saturday (and half-hourly in the evenings and on Sundays). There are also less frequent services to Stranraer,and Kilmarnock. All passengers travelling to/from the airport will receive 50% discount from/to anywhere in Scotland on the standard fare. Passengers joining the train at Prestwick Airport require to show their official flight confirmation and photo id to the train's ticket examiner when <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> ticket, {{as there is no}} ticketing office at Prestwick Airport.|$|E
50|$|Since the Housing and Town Planning Act 1919 {{the number}} of council houses had {{steadily}} risen for over fifty years and council tenants could only <b>buy</b> <b>their</b> home {{with the permission of}} their local authority.

25|$|Hayden {{voted for}} American entry into World War I and then {{successfully}} added {{an amendment to}} a military manpower bill that prohibited conscripted personnel from avoiding military service by <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> way out and requiring all draftees {{to remain in the}} military {{until the end of the}} war. He also favored humane treatment of conscientious objectors. As an officer in the Arizona National Guard prior to the war, major Hayden volunteered to join his unit and served as commander of the 9th battalion, 166th Depot Brigade at Camp Lewis, Washington helping prepare his division for active duty. The war ended before his unit was transferred to Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{members of}} the Guet {{were part of the}} local neighborhood, and were almost all Parisians; they were known for taking bribes and <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> commissions. The {{members of the}} Garde were mostly former army {{soldiers}} from the provinces, with little attachment to Paris. They were headquartered in the quarter Saint-Martin, and were more efficient and reliable supporters of the royal government, responsible for putting down riots in 1709 and 1725. In 1771 the Guet was formally placed under the command of the Garde, and was gradually integrated into its organization. The responsibilities of the Garde were far-ranging, from chasing criminals to monitoring bread prices, keeping traffic moving on the streets, settling disputes and maintaining public order.|$|E
25|$|In 1987 the Broadcasting (Ownership and Control) Act {{replaced}} the Two TV Station rule – which had capped ownership of Metropolitan TV stations at two – with a 60% Reach rule. This would {{pave the way}} for major changes in television ownership in Australia as the three television networks expanded beyond Sydney and Melbourne, <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> affiliates in other capitals. At the time Kerry Stokes owned ADS 7 Adelaide, CTC 7 in Canberra and had just won the licence for NEW 10 in Perth. Stokes had planned to buy the Seven Network from John Fairfax which would have seen CTC align with ATN 7 Sydney and HSV 7 Melbourne. Stokes offered $100 million more than rival Christopher Skase for Seven, but was ultimately unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|On {{the day of}} her sailing Strumas engine failed so a tug towed her out of {{the port}} of Constanţa. The waters off Constanţa were mined, so a Romanian vessel escorted her clear of the minefield. She then drifted {{overnight}} while her crew tried vainly to start her engine. She transmitted distress signals and on 13 December the Romanian tug returned. The tug's crew said they would not repair Strumas engine unless they were paid. The refugees had no money after <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> tickets and leaving Romania, so they gave all their wedding rings to the tugboatmen, who then repaired the engine. Struma then got under way but by 15 December her engine had failed again so she was towed into Istanbul in Turkey.|$|E
25|$|If {{people ask}} {{in the name}} of {{religion}} we must help them. The vehicle of this support is a complete boycott of the enemies' goods. Each riyal, dirham …etc. used to buy their goods eventually becomes bullets to be fired at the hearts of brothers and children in Palestine. For this reason, it is an obligation not to help them (the enemies of Islam) by <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> goods. To buy their goods is to support tyranny, oppression and aggression. Buying goods from them will strengthen them; our duty is to make them as weak as we can. Our obligation is to strengthen our resisting brothers in the Sacred Land as much as we can. If we cannot strengthen the brothers, we have a duty to make the enemy weak. If their weakness cannot be achieved except by boycott, we must boycott them.|$|E
25|$|The band {{released}} many demos and EPs {{in their}} early days when playing the London circuit in the UK. With every batch of new songs that The Subways would compose, Lunn would insist that the band record them. However, {{at such a young}} age the group had no money with which to go into a studio to record consistently, so they came upon the idea of <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> own cheap recording system at home. Eventually, the band had their own website, http://www.thesubways.net, which Lunn himself constructed and maintained, where they put all their new songs. Through the use of their own home recording system they now had roughly eight demos worth of songs both on the internet and being sent out to local and London promoters at various venues. The Subways then began touring in the local and London area playing regularly at the Buffalo Bar in Highbury and Islington.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, {{the hybrid}} {{affiliation}} {{led to the}} parent team <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> affiliate's franchise outright. On March 24, 2015, the Utah Jazz purchased their affiliate, the Idaho Stampede, and after one more season in Boise relocated the team to Salt Lake City. On April 11, 2016, the Phoenix Suns purchased their affiliate, the Bakersfield Jam, and announced the immediate relocation of the team to Prescott Valley, Arizona, as the Northern Arizona Suns beginning with the 2016–17 season. On October 20, 2016, the Sacramento Kings bought the majority ownership of their affiliate of the previous eight seasons, the Reno Bighorns. On December 14, 2016, the Magic purchased their affiliate, the Erie BayHawks, with the intention to relocate the team to Lakeland, Florida, in 2017. In 2017, the Miami Heat purchased the controlling interest in the Sioux Falls Skyforce after being its primary affiliate since 2013.|$|E
25|$|Formal dances {{are held}} twice {{annually}} at Trinity. The Saints Ball is held {{annually in the}} fall semester around November at St. Hilda's College, and the Conversat ball is held at Trinity College in the Winter semester. Traditionally, the Saint's Ball was hosted by Women of College in their residence, while Conversat was hosted by Men of College in theirs. While the residences have been desegregated since 2005, the tradition remains that the Women of College ask the men (or other women) to Saints, and the men ask the women (or other men) to Conversat. At Saints, the Women of College are responsible for <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> date's ticket and drinks for the night, and at Conversat, the same is expected of the Men of College. When someone {{has been asked to}} either Saints or Conversat, it is considered in poor taste to refuse them without a prior engagement.|$|E
25|$|The Palestinian {{movement}} relocated {{most of its}} fighting {{strength to}} Lebanon {{at the end of}} 1970 after being expelled from Jordan in the events known as Black September. The umbrella organization, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)—by itself undoubtedly Lebanon's most potent fighting force at the time—was little more than a loose confederation, but its leader, Yassir Arafat, controlled all factions by <b>buying</b> <b>their</b> loyalties. Arafat allowed little oversight to be exercised over PLO finances as he was the ultimate source for all decisions made in directing financial matters. Arafat's control of funds, channeled directly to him by the oil producing countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Libya meant that he had little real functional opposition to his leadership and although ostensibly rival factions in the PLO existed, this masked a stable loyalty towards Arafat so long as he was able to dispense financial rewards to his followers and members of the PLO guerrilla factions.|$|E
