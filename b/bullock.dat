5|$|<b>Bullock</b> {{served as}} Chambers' second for the duel; Bibb acted as second for Rowan. According to Bibb, he and <b>Bullock</b> met on February 1 {{to discuss the}} {{parameters}} for the duel. <b>Bullock</b> proposed that the matter be dropped, but Bibb insisted that Chambers would have to retract his challenge, to which <b>Bullock</b> would not consent. The duel was held February 3, 1801, near Bardstown. Both combatants missed with their first shots. Both men fired again, and Rowan's second shot struck Chambers, wounding him severely. (Bibb's account says that Chambers was struck in the left side; other accounts state that the shot hit Chambers in the chest.) Rowan then offered his carriage to take Chambers to town for medical attention, and Chambers asked that Rowan not be prosecuted. Despite medical aid, Chambers died the following day.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bullocks</b> Wilshire {{was one of}} {{the more}} {{important}} divisions of <b>Bullock's,</b> Inc. until it was consolidated into I. Magnin by Macy's in 1989. The division could be traced to the opening of a single luxury branch store of <b>Bullock's</b> in 1929. In 1968, The <b>Bullock's</b> store in Palm Springs (built in 1947) was transferred to the control of <b>Bullock's</b> Wilshire to be its first branch store. Four years later, in 1972, <b>Bullock's</b> Wilshire store was separated from <b>Bullock's</b> as a separate division with its own, president, chairman, buyers and staff with Walter Bergquist, former president of <b>Bullock's,</b> assigned as the division's first president.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bullock's,</b> <b>Bullocks</b> Wilshire, and I. Magnin {{retained}} their autonomy under Federated, as well {{as their}} carriage-trade niche, with I. Magnin expanding into the Chicago and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas and <b>Bullock's</b> opening stores in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Northern California. In 1983 however, Federated shuttered the <b>Bullock's</b> North division and sold most of its locations to Seattle, Washington retailer Nordstrom. In 1988, after an ugly takeover battle between Robert Campeau and Macy's for Federated, <b>Bullock's</b> and I. Magnin were sold by Campeau to Macy's as a consolation prize for one billion dollars, which plunged Macy's into debt. The new owners responded by dismantling <b>Bullock's</b> Los Angeles corporate offices, merging <b>Bullocks</b> Wilshire into I. Magnin, and <b>Bullock's</b> into its Macy's South division, thus sending what had been Federated's most profitable division into a precipitous decline and alienating the local customers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bullock's</b> was a {{department}} store chain, headquartered in Los Angeles, California.

5|$|In March, Robert Downey Jr. entered discussions to be cast in {{the male}} lead role. In September, Cuarón {{received}} approval from Warner Bros. to offer the role without a screen test to Natalie Portman, who was praised for her performance in Black Swan (2010) at that time. Portman rejected the project because of scheduling conflicts, and Warner Bros. then approached Sandra <b>Bullock</b> for the role.

50|$|The end came {{quickly for}} <b>Bullock's</b> after Macy's filed for {{bankruptcy}} protection in 1992, with the <b>Bullocks</b> Wilshire stores being renamed I. Magnin two years before. I.

Magnin itself was dissolved in January 1995 once Federated Department Stores reappeared on the scene and acquired Macy's. In 1996—following the acquisition of Broadway Stores, Inc.—Federated consolidated all its traditional department-store business in California under the Macy's nameplate, ending 89 years of <b>Bullock's.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1944 <b>Bullock's</b> {{acquired}} I. Magnin & Co., a venerable, San Francisco-based upscale specialty chain. This {{was followed}} by the acquisition of the then public-owned Bullock's/I. Magnin organization in 1964 by Federated Department Stores, much to the dismay of surviving founder P.G. Winnett, who publicly lambasted the deal (which was initiated by his own son-in-law, <b>Bullock's</b> President Walter W. Candy Jr.). In the 1970s, to differentiate itself from the full-line <b>Bullock's</b> stores, the very exclusive Wilshire location dropped its apostrophe, became <b>Bullocks</b> Wilshire, and began its own expansion.|$|R

50|$|Farming {{in the dry}} Deccan {{region of}} the Bombay Presidency {{required}} more farm animals—typically <b>bullocks</b> to pull the heavier ploughs—than were needed in other, wetter, regions of India; often, up to six <b>bullocks</b> were needed for ploughing.

5|$|The {{traditional}} {{modes of}} transportation are <b>bullock</b> carts. It is recorded that {{as late as}} the 1950s, landlords and rich farmers travelled mostly by <b>bullock</b> carts with the exception of rare long journeys which they undertook by buses or motor vehicles. Kumbakonam has an efficient local bus transportation system. The mofussil bus stand is located in the south-east of Kumbakonam and is situated just opposite to the Arignar Anna Bus Stand where the long-distance buses are stationed. There are occasional ferries that transport people and goods across the Cauvery. Till the beginning of the 20th century, students of the Government Arts College used to cross the Cauvery on coracle ferries in order to attend college. Since the construction of a bridge in 1944, the practice of transporting men and goods by coracles has greatly diminished.|$|E
5|$|They were unpopular with sportsmen as {{the dark}} colours of the breed {{did not show}} up in hunting conditions, and the {{elongated}} and short shape of the early breed was not very practical for moving easily through cover.

Burdett was said to have owned a variety of black Cocker Spaniels. <b>Bullock</b> crossed the Field Spaniel with the Sussex Spaniel and the English Water Spaniel.
