He gives a cold reception to Colonel Breen (Julian Glover), who has been assigned to join Quatermass's British Experimental Rocket Group. When the bomb disposal team call for Breen's assistance, Quatermass accompanies him to the site. Breen concludes it is a V-weapon, but Quatermass disagrees. When another skeleton is found in an inner chamber, Quatermass and Roney realise that the object must also be five million years old. Quatermass suspects it is of alien origin, but Roney is certain the apemen are terrestrial.|$|E

5|$|The F-28s had {{the largest}} {{regularity}} problems, mostly due {{to the number of}} landings, which could count up to 16 per day. For instance, LN-SUO flew 36,000 hours with 76,000 landings. The last flight was made on 16 December 1986, and the aircraft sold for NOK45 million each. Although the F-28 was taken out of service, some of the routes on the West Coast needed to be operated with smaller aircraft than the 737. The company made an agreement to wet lease Busy Bee F-27s one some of the routes, while the most trafficked ones would <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> by 737s.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is in spring. During {{the beginning of}} the {{breeding season}}, courting pairs soar high together and one or both may make steep spiralling or swooping dives. The birds are monogamous and pair bonds may be maintained for more than one breeding season and the same nest sites may be reused each year. The nest is an untidy platform of twigs lined with rags and placed on a cliff ledge, building, or the fork of a large tree. Old nest platforms of eagles may also <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over.</b> Nests placed on the ground are rare but have been recorded in subspecies N. p. ginginianus and N. p. majorensis.|$|E
5|$|Trans-Canada Air Lines, {{now known}} as Air Canada, and Canadian Pacific Air Lines served Penticton after World WarII. In 1956, the airport was granted a {{permanent}} license, replacing the temporary permit. The airport's runway was extended in 1959, and a new terminal was built in 1963. In 1968, Canadian Pacific Air Lines extended its services for the airport, scheduling two daily flights, only to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> by Pacific Western Airlines the following year. However, in 1988, Canadian Airlines ended this service. That was replaced by Time Air and Air BC airlines; both airlines are no longer active.|$|E

5|$|Females {{are ready}} to breed at ten to eleven months of age {{although}} males sometimes wait till the following year. Barn owls are usually monogamous, sticking to one partner for life unless one of the pair dies. During the non-breeding season they may roost separately, but as the breeding season approaches they return to their established nesting site, showing considerable site fidelity. In colder climates, in harsh weather and where winter food supplies may be scarce, they may roost in farm buildings and in barns between hay bales, but they then run the risk that their selected nesting hole may <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> by some other, earlier-nesting species. Single males may establish feeding territories, patrolling the hunting areas, occasionally stopping to hover, and perching on lofty eminences where they screech to attract a mate. Where a female has lost her mate but maintained her breeding site, she usually seems to manage to attract a new spouse.|$|E
5|$|In the Lillehammer {{bid for the}} 1994 Winter Olympics, the {{agreement}} between Lillehammer Municipality and the state specified that the municipality was responsible for financing all necessary sports venues. However, after the games were awarded the responsibility {{was taken over by}} Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) and the town's five venues were ultimately funded through state grants. To allow for post-Olympic use, a fund was created by the state, of which Lillehammer Olympiapark received 146 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Unlike the Hamar venues, which survive on their fund's yield, the Lillehammer venues have used up their capital. From 2014 the post-Olympic use fund will be depleted and alternative organization and funding is being looked into. A leading proposal is that the bobsleigh and luge track <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> by the state, while the remaining venues be retained by the company and jointly funded by the municipality and Oppland County Municipality.|$|E
5|$|On 19 June 2008, the {{municipal}} council voted to not give further subsidies to the airport. Upgrades for NOK8 million {{were needed to}} meed safety standard. The airport operator had debt of NOK12 million, and no realizeable assets. Vildanden was under certain conditions willing to pay some of the capital needed to perform the upgrades. The municipal council changed their opinion and voted—with a single decisive vote—to keep the airport running in July. The financial risk would <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> by {{the municipal}}-owned Kontorbygg, who operate a range of offices and commercial buildings in Skien. The proposal {{was supported by the}} right-winged parties, and opposed by the socialist parties, as well as the chair of Kontorbygg. As a response, the Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries reported the municipality to ESA, and demanded that NOK20 million in illegal subsidies be repaid by Vildanden and the airport operator.|$|E

5|$|On 24 April 2002, SAS {{announced}} that all handling services operated by Braathens would <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> by SAS Ground Services. All SAS employees would be prioritized in the rationalization process, and 800 Braathens employees were laid off. Three hundred Braathens' employees were offered jobs with SAS Ground Services, but these lost their seniority. No employees in SAS lost their jobs. The case {{ended in the}} courts, where 369 former Braathens employees sued SAS to receive the same seniority as they had in Braathens. On 15 October 2003, Asker and Bærum District Court decided that only 42 of the employees, those working in Kristiansund and Molde, had right to keep their seniority. The case was appealed, and on 18 March 2005, Borgarting Court of Appeal, with four against three votes, decided in favor of SAS, denying the employees their claim. The matter was not settled until 31 January 2006, when the Supreme Court of Norway {{ruled in favor of}} the employees.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipal}} council voted on 17 February 2011 {{to purchase the}} stadium. The strongest proponents were the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, while three parties, the Progress Party, the Liberal Party and Red Party, voted against. The proponents argued that municipality was purchasing the venue with a much higher value than what they had sold, while the opponents {{argued that it was}} not the municipality's responsibility to give financial first-aid to a professional sports club. The cost was NOK16 million, paid for by taking over debt. After taking over the stadium company, the municipality merged it with Bodø Spektrum, which runs an indoor sports complex, including Nordlandshallen. This allows the debt to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> by the municipality without interfering with the municipal accounts.|$|E
5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a division that was moving into the front line. Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders would {{be taken to the}} forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of the front that were to be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers would be taken to the headquarters of the division that they were relieving to observe the methods used for drawing rations and ammunition, {{and the manner in which}} they were supplied to the troops at the front. Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for the front line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E
