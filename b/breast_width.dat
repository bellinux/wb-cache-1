40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to explore the relationship among body measurements in 3 strains of broilers chicken (Arbor Acre, Marshal and Ross) using principal component analysis with the view of identifying those components that define body conformation in broilers. A total of 180 birds were used, 60 per strain. The parameters recorded at 8 weeks of age were body weight, shank length, thigh length, drumstick length, body length, body width, <b>breast</b> <b>width</b> and wing length. Principal component analysis with variance maximizing orthogonal rotation was used to extract the components. Two principal components were extracted in Arbor Acre which explained 65 % of the total variation in the original variables. Similarly three principal components each were extracted in Marshal and Ross strains accounting for 74. 76 % and 70 % of the total variance respectively. Generally, PC 1 had the largest share of the total variance and correlated highly with <b>breast</b> <b>width,</b> wing length, thigh length, shank length and body length. PC 1 was termed the generalized form of broilers. PC 2 had its loadings on drum stick length, <b>breast</b> <b>width,</b> thigh length and wing length while PC 3 had positive loading on drumstick length. These components could be used as selection criteria for improving body size of broilers...|$|E

The expected reduction in potential gain in live weight, dressing percentage and carcass characteristics resulting from restricting change in subcutaneous fat level to zero were assessed. The aggregate genotype measurements were weight at slaughter, dressing percentage and percent subcutaneous fat. The index measurements were weight at hatching, weight at slaughter, weight gain, <b>breast</b> <b>width,</b> breast length and breast circumference.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to estimate the correlation between body weight and body conformation of two broiler strains. A total of 200 broiler chickens comprising of 100 Hubbard and 100 Arboracre strains were used in the determination of their correlation between body weight and body conformation from day old to 8 weeks (0 - 8 weeks) of age. Weekly body weight and body conformations like shank length, keel length, <b>breast</b> <b>width,</b> back length and neck length were taken thrice in a week and the correlation between body weight and the body conformations were computed at the 8 th week of the experiment for both strains. Hubbard broiler strain had the correlation of 0. 9416, 0. 894, 0. 861, 0. 897 and 0. 963 between body weight and other body conformation while for Arboracre strain, the correlation of 0. 967, 0. 974, 0. 882, 2. 935, 0. 981 and 0. 969 were obtained between body weight and back length, shank length, thigh length, keel length, <b>breast</b> <b>width</b> and back length respectively. The correlation between other body conformations range between 0. 977 and 0. 795, all indicating strong positive correlations. Hence, there is a strong linear relationship between body weight, neck length, shank length, thigh length, keel length, <b>breast</b> <b>width</b> and back length for both Hubbard and Arboracre strains...|$|E
40|$|Since 1935, the bra sizing {{system has}} been based on bust girth and underbust girth. Woman's breast is however a very complex 3 D geometry, the {{existing}} sizing system based on just two girth measurements may be inappropriate in the categorization of breast sizes for bras. Through analyzing the nude breast measurements from 456 subjects aged between 20 and 39, we hereby propose a new bra sizing system for Chinese women. The new sizing system uses underbust girth and the <b>breast</b> depth <b>width</b> ratio as the classifying parameters. They were identified through principal component factor analysis and K-means cluster analysis as the two most critical parameters out of 98 measurements obtained from 3 D body scanning and 5 supplementary manual measurements as well as other relevant breast parameters including <b>breast</b> angles, distance, <b>width,</b> thickness, volume and curvature. Relevance to industry: The existing bra sizing system is inadequate in classifying breast sizes for bras.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Several {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} birds differing in body weight, conformation and sternal measurements to obtain information on {{whether it would be}} possible during short term selection to influence the shape of the sternum and, if so, what influence this would have on the amount and distribution of the breast meat. The first experiment consisted of sixteen matings between three groups of meat production strains and a strain of giant Leghorn. In the progeny from the first experiment birds were {{selected on the basis of}} sternal measurements and <b>breast</b> <b>width</b> in various combinations. A total of three generations were obtained and provided data from 316 males and 319 females in five different matings. The data were subjected to an analysis of covariance to obtain information on the significance of differences between the lines of regression in the measurements taken. The results did not support the original hypothesis that an increase in <b>breast</b> <b>width</b> would bring a concurrent decrease in keel length, keel height or keel indentation. However the muscles of the breast showed some divergent development with selection. An increase in keel length produced a relatively greater increase in the pectoralis major than in the pectoralis secundus whereas an increase in <b>breast</b> <b>width</b> increased both muscles equally. Various measurements of growth were observed in one experiment and it was found that all six measurements taken weekly increased linearly. This supports the hypothesis that general growth factors probably have the greatest influence on development. Some of the measurements in the broiler groups were compared to the same measurements in egg production Leghorns. The lines of regression of these measurements were parallel indicating that no difference exists in the body parts measured, between the broiler groups and the egg production Leghorn...|$|E

To explore an effective way to promote biodiversity and associated ecosystem services, we examined Taxodium distichum as a species for afforesting the {{littoral zone}}. Sapling growth variations were measured after two rounds of winter flooding. Dominant influence factors were determined by redundancy analysis. Herb community similarities between the experimental afforested areas and nearby control areas were assessed to detect the ecosystem influence of the experimental afforestation. 94. 5 % of saplings planted at elevations above 168 m survived. All measured growth indices (tree height, diameter at <b>breast</b> height, crown <b>width</b> and foliage density) decreased as the flood depth increased.

40|$|Later-age {{fertilization}} with superphosphate of Pinus radiata {{is one of}} the silvicultural practices used in Australia and {{is employed}} operationally on phosphorus deficient sites found in Victoria. Later-age fertilization of radiata pine has previously been shown to give satisfactory responses in terms of growth, wood production and economic values. However, sudden increases in growth rate can lead to detrimental effects on wood properties. The present study was aimed at examining the effect of later-age fertilization with superphosphate at age 24 on the tree growth, mechanical properties and wood quality of radiata pine grown on a phosphorus deficient site. Three trees from each of three diameter classes were selected randomly from a control plot and an adjacent fertilized plot at Scarsdale, Victoria. The fertilized plot had received 504 kg ha- 1 superphosphate at age 24 and all eighteen trees studied were felled at age 38. Ring width, percent latewood and tracheid length were examined using a wood disc removed at <b>breast</b> height. Ring <b>width</b> and latewood were measured for each growth ring from pith to bark along the north and south axes. Tracheid length was measured for selected growth rings along the north axis. Basic specific gravity from pith to bark for the north and south axes was determined using the maximum moisture content method at five heights including 0. 3 m, 1. 3 m, 3. 3 m, 7. 3 m and 13. 3 m. Mechanical properties which included static bending and compression parallel to the grain were determined for four axes for clear specimens removed from a 1. 0 m log taken near breast height. Diameter and height growth of the fertilized trees increased significantly over the fifteen year period following fertilization by 30 % and 34 % respectively as compared to the controls. Volume of the fertilized trees increased 212 % over the same period as compared to 77 % for the controls. No significant differences in the strength properties were found for the wood produced after the age of fertilization between the control and fertilized trees. Non significant reductions of 8 %, 6 % and 4 % were found for bending properties modulus of rupture, modulus of elacticity and stress at limit proportionality respectively. Non significant reductions of 6 %, 11 % and 12 % were found for compression properties of maximum crushing strength, modulus of elasticity and stress at limit of proportionality. Mechanical properties of both the control and fertilized trees were generally greater than previously reported values for radiata pine. Ring widths increased substantially within two to three years following fertilization with mean values of the fertilized trees around two times that of the control trees. The enhanced radial growth was maintained through to harvest at age 38 and when combined with the the second thinning at age 35 increased even further relative to the controls. The effect of fertilization on percent lateveood was not consistent but appears to be somewhat dependent on the availability of moisture. The effect of fertilization on tracheid length was not clear as there appeared to be a site effect which resulted in the tracheid lengths of the fertilized trees being greater than the controls prior to fertilization. Basic specific gravity was reduced about 4 % to 9 % following fertilization and the effect appeared to last for about six to nine years. It appears that the first thinning which occurred at age 20 prior to the fertilization contributed to this reduction in basic specific gravity. Over approximately the final six years of growth the basic specific gravity of the fertilized trees was 3 % to 6 % greater than the control trees. In conclusion, the effect of later-age fertilization with superphosphate at age 24 on the mechanical properties and overall wood quality appears to be minimal. The large gains made in tree volume following fertrilization on the phosphorus deficient site at Scarsdale {{and the fact that the}} later-age fertilization brings a relatively unproductive site into a productive capacity would appear to far outweigh any minimal reductions in wood properties. It further appears that on the deficient site the phosphorus remains available for tree growth through to rotation age and the additional wood produced at the later-age tends to have the desirable mature wood properties as compared to the less desirable wood properties which normally accompany the juvenile growth period.

Prediction equations relating body weight to linear body measurements at 2 and 8 weeks of age were established for the four strains of broilers using multiple regression method. The results indicated similarity in bod y weight at 8 weeks, weight gain and feed conversion ratio among Anak, Arbor Acre and Ross broilers. They were however, significantly (p< 0. 01) superior to Marshal in all these traits. The regression analysis were highly significant (p< 0. 001) for the two age periods and in all the strains. The coefficient of multiple determinants (R 2) were more than 50 % in most of the groups indicating that the prediction equations obtained in this study co uld be used to predict body weight of broilers...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{comparing}} the two important economic traits (body weight and conformations) of Hubbard and Arboracre commercial broiler chickens treated under the same dietary and environmental conditions. A total of two hundred broiler strains comprising of 100 Hubbard and 100 Arboracre strain {{were used in the}} comparative evaluation of their body weight and body conformation from day old to 8 weeks of age. Body weight were taken on weekly basis while linear body measurement like shank length, <b>breast</b> <b>width,</b> back length, neck, thigh length and keel length were taken three times a week. Hubbard broiler strain had the body weight of 0. 298 ¬± 0. 0287, 1. 0083 ¬± 0. 0123, 2. 063 ¬± 0. 0219 and 3. 079 ¬± 0. 02 J kg while Arboracre strain attain the body weight of 0. 2603 ¬± 0. 0587, 0. 8125 ¬± 0. 0185, 1. 7100 ¬± 0. 0287 and 2. 604 ¬± 0. 0219 kg, respectively all at 2. 46 and 8 weeks of age. The linear body measurements of Hubbard strain were significantly higher than that of Arborace strain (p< 0. 05) at 8 weeks of age for all parameters studied.

40|$|Three locally adapted parental turkey {{lines of}} black (B), bronze (Br) and white (W) plumage {{coloured}} genotypes were crossed in full diallel arrangement. Each line comprised of 7 males and 15 females {{and a total}} of 285 poults were measured. General combining ability (GCA), specific combining ability (SCA) and reciprocal effects (RE) were estimated for six traits at 12 weeks old: body weight (BWT), <b>breast</b> <b>width</b> (BrWt), drumstick length (DSL), shank length (SL), keel length (KL), and body length (BL). There were significant cross and sex effects (P < 0. 05) but no significant interaction. The GCA was not significant for any trait but SCA was significant (P < 0. 01) for all morphometric traits but not for BWT. The estimates ranged from 0. 61 for BWT to 8. 33 for BL, 0. 68 for BWT to 9. 23 for BL, and 0. 507 for BWT to 8. 88 for BL in BxBr, BxW and BrxW crosses respectively. RE was not significant in any of the traits. The non-significant GCA estimates along with the significant SCA estimates suggest that genes governing the six traits measured do not act additively but improvement may be attained by exploiting crossbreeding. The lack of significant reciprocal effects indicates that maternal effects are not important and reciprocal crosses may be used without loss of biological performance in the progeny...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 216 day-old F 1 chicks {{generated}} by main and reciprocal crossbreeding of normal local (NL), naked neck (Na) and frizzle (F) chickens with Arbor Acre broiler (E) breeder stock {{were used in}} the study. Mean day-old weights of the main crossbreds (ExNL, ExNa, and ExF) were 26. 80, 26. 00 and 26. 50 g, respectively and were significantly (P< 0. 05) less than mean day-old weights of 30. 10, 30. 50 and 30. 40 g for reciprocal crossbreds (NLxE, NaxE, and FxE), respectively. These reciprocal crossbreds maintained their superiority in body weight, had higher feed intake and better feed conversion ratios till the end of experiment at 18 weeks. The linear body measurements (LBMs) : body length, wing length, keel length, <b>breast</b> <b>width</b> except shank length were longer in the reciprocal crossbreds than in their main cross counterparts. The final range of body weights achieved in the main crossbreds (866. 33 to 941. 00 g) and in the reciprocal crossbreds (1350. 00 to 2150. 00 g) depict the main cross individuals as light birds which could be developed as egg-laying lines and the reciprocal crosses as heavy birds which could be developed as meat-type or dual purpose birds. In general, the performance of these crossbred chickens showed evidence of maternal influence with each group behaving like its dam-of-origin. The FxE individuals outperformed all other genetic groups with respect to body weight and linear body parameter development, thus indicating that the frizzle gene may be advantageous in producing fast growing chickens in the humid tropics...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} try and differentiate variations in the levels of total plasma protein and plasma protein fractions from three lines of turkeys, each with distinct muscle morphological characteristics [...] Deep Pectoral Myopathy (DPM), Hereditary Muscular Dystrophy (MDY), and a Broad Breasted Bronze control (J). Ten day old poults {{from each of the}} three lines were grown in similar environments. Individual blood plasma samples were collected, body weights and <b>breast</b> <b>width</b> measurements determined at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age (WOA) (Experiment 1), and at 20, 30, 40 and 50 WOA (Experiment 2). Total plasma protein concentrations of both myopathic lines (combined sexes) were greater (P< 0. 05) than that of the control line at 12 WOA. DPM birds continued to exhibit higher (P< 0. 05) total protein levels than the control line through 16 WOA. At 20 and 40 WOA, DPM females had higher (P< 0. 05) total protein levels than the control females. A total of 6 plasma protein fractions were commonly observed in the electrophoretograms of the three lines of turkeys. The highest levels of pre-albumin and albumin were encountered in both the DPM and MDY lines at 12 WOA, with DPM birds maintaining higher levels (P< 0. 05) of albumin also at 16 WOA. No consistent trends were observed in pre-albumin and albumin levels of males and females from the three lines from 20 to 50 WOA; however, significant differences (P< 0. 05) between sexes were observed in the two fractions when compared within each line. DPM and MDY groups exhibited higher levels (P< 0. 05) of alpha- 1 and alpha- 2 globulins than the control values at 12 WOA, with MDY birds having greater levels (P< 0. 05) of beta and gamma globulins at 16 WOA. When compared to females from the control group (J), DPM females had significantly greater levels of alpha- 2 and gamma globulins at 20 WOA, and higher levels (P< 0. 05) of alpha- 2 and beta globulins at 40 WOA. At 40 and 50 WOA, DPM males exhibited greater levels (P< 0. 05) of alpha- 2 globulin when compared to that of the control males. Comparisons between sexes within each of the three lines showed DPM and MDY females to have significantly greater levels of alpha- 1 globulin than that of the respective males at 20 and 40 WOA. At 50 WOA, DPM females exhibited lower levels of (P< 0. 05) alpha- 2 globulin compared to DPM males, with both J and DPM females exhibiting significantly higher levels of beta globulin than those of males from the respective lines. Body weight and <b>breast</b> <b>width</b> values of both myopathic lines were lower (P< 0. 05) than those of the control (J) line at 8, 12 and 16 WOA (Experiment 1). Both females and males from the myopathic lines exhibited significantly lower body weights and breast widths when compared to J females and males, respectively. Significant differences were observed consistently when sexes were compared within each of the lines, with males having greater breast widths and body weights at 20, 30, 40 and 50 WOA (Experiment 2). Although variations were observed in both levels of total plasma protein and its fractions, no consistent differences were associated with either myopathic disorder. The results from this study indicate that plasma protein electrophoresis was not a suitable diagnostic technique for the two myopathic conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in three districts of central zone of Tigray, with the aim to assess the socioeconomic characteristics and production environments of local chicken ecotypes, along with farmers‚Äô breeding objectives, breeding practice, and traits of preference for local chickens and to assess the phenotypic characteristics of the local chicken. A total of 242 chicken owners were selected for the study. Nine qualitative and nineteen quantitative traits from 457 chickens were considered. The research finding revealed that village chicken production seems to be an important activity with an average flock size 9. 41 and 8. 98 birds per household in midland and highland agro ecology. The most important chicken production system of the study area is traditional with small feed supplementation. A separate house to keep chicken was practiced in 36. 8 % and 28. 9 % of the respondents in highland and midland area, respectively. About 87. 6 % of the respondents select eggs for incubation and straw was commonly used as bedding material. About 96. 7 % of the respondent use broody hens for incubation and rearing chicks. About 81 % of households participate in chicken and egg marketing as a source of income. Culling is practiced by 78. 9 % of households based on production level of chicken, age, plumage color, ill and bad temperament of hens and cocks. The main breeding objectives of the respondents were meant for household consumption, income generation and for replacement of the flock. The effective population size (Ne) and the rate of inbreeding (√ÑF) calculated for the indigenous chicken flock of the study area were 3. 99 and 0. 13, respectively. The selection criteria used for selection of breeding hen were egg size, plumage color, broodiness, disease resistance and hatchability with an average index value of 0. 067, 0. 064, 0. 062, 0. 054, 0. 042. The highest selection criteria used for selection of breeding cock were egg number of the dam, comb type, plumage color, and disease resistance, egg size growth rate with an index value of 0. 053, 0. 052, 0. 045, 0. 044, 0. 041 and 0. 041, respectively. Farmers preferred traits like comb type, plumage color, egg size, broodiness, disease resistance, meat quality, fertility growth, egg number and body size with indices of 0. 169, 0. 156, 0. 137, 0. 117, 0. 114, 0. 113, 0. 108, 0. 096 and 0077, respectively. Reproductive performance study revealed that the overall mean age at first mating of male chickens and the age at first egg of female chickens were 5. 29 and 5. 96 months. Local chicken were mostly normally feathered (hens 97. 8 %, cocks 96 %), red (33 %), grayish (17. 5 %), brownish (17. 3 %) colors. Morph metric measurements indicated that significance differences (P< 0. 05) were observed between agro ecology with respect to <b>breast</b> <b>width,</b> spur length, chest circumferences and shank length. In all parameters, male shows higher significance (P< 0. 001) value than female except <b>breast</b> <b>width</b> and beak width. Multivariate analysis result showed that five PC were extracted that accounted for 58. 45 % of the total variation. The differentiation of highland and midland populations was apparent based on the weights of neck length, beak length, body length, wattle width, body weight, wattle length and height at back traits. The Mahalanobis‚Äô distances between populations shows the smallest and largest distances between highland and midland chicken ecotypes. In conclusion, there is diversity of indigenous chicken population and farmers‚Äô preference for specific traits that may invite to design community based genetic improvement.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine direct and maternal genetic effects, direct and maternal heritabilities as well as phenotypic variances and correlations on growth and some growth-related traits on locally adapted ecotypes of turkeys in southeastern Nigeria. Three parental lines with black (B), bronze (Br), or white (W) plumage colored genotypes were compared. Traits considered were body weight at 4, 8, and 12 weeks-old (BW 4, BW 8, BW 12, respectively), <b>breast</b> <b>width</b> at 4, 8 and 12 weeks-old (BrWt 4, BrWt 8, BrWt 12, respectively), and shank lengthsat 4, 8 and 12 weeks old (SL 4, SL 8, SL 12, respectively). Data were analyzed using restricted maximum likelihood under an animal model. The direct genetic variance ranged from 0. 02 to 21. 2 and the maternal genetic variance from 0. 02 to 567, while the phenotypic variance ranged from 1. 57 to 1226. Direct heritability estimates had values from 0. 01 (BW 8, BW 12, SL 4) to 0. 20 (BrWt 4). Maternal heritability estimates ranged from 0. 01 (SL 8) to 0. 74 (BrWt 4) and the estimates of maternal environmental variance as a proportion of phenotypic variance varied from 0. 005 (BW 4) to 0. 63 (SL 8). The correlations between direct and maternal additive genetic effects (ram) were all high with some being negative, e. g., - 0. 98, - 0. 96, - 0. 96, - 0. 95, - 0. 98 for BW 4, BrWt 4, BrWt 12, SL 4 and SL 8, respectively while these were positive for the other traits: 0. 87, 0. 89, 0. 76 and 0. 99 for BW 8, BW 12, BrWt 8, and SL 12, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Turkey is an {{important}} agricultural species and is largely used as a meat bird. In 2004, turkey represented 6. 5 % of the world poultry meat production. The world-wide turkey population has rapidly grown due to increased commercial farming. Due to the high demand for turkey meat from both consumers and industry global turkey stocks increased from 100 million in 1970 to over 276 million in 2004. This rapidly increasing importance of turkeys was a reason to design this study for the estimation of genetic parameters that control body weight, body composition, meat quality traits and parameters that shape the growth curve in turkey birds. Results The average heritability estimate for body weight traits was 0. 38, except for early weights that were strongly affected by maternal effects. This study showed that body weight traits, upper asymptote (a growth curve trait), percent breast meat and redness of meat had high heritability whereas heritabilities of breast length, <b>breast</b> <b>width,</b> percent drip loss, ultimate pH, lightness and yellowness of meat were medium to low. We found high positive genetic and phenotypic correlations between body weight, upper asymptote, most breast meat yield traits and percent drip loss but percent drip loss was found strongly negatively correlated with ultimate pH. Percent breast meat, however, showed genetic correlations close to zero with body weight traits and upper asymptote. Conclusion The results of this analysis and the growth curve from the studied population of turkey birds suggest that the turkey birds could be selected for breeding between 60 and 80 days of age {{in order to improve}} overall production and the production of desirable cuts of meat. The continuous selection of birds within this age range could promote high growth rates but specific attention to meat quality would be needed to avoid a negative impact on the quality of meat. </p...|$|E
40|$|Experiment was {{conducted}} at Avian Research and Training Centre UVAS Lahore in order to observe and identify the effect of different levels of garlic supplementation and a commercial growth promoter on Japanese quail. Four different levels of garlic powder (0. 1 % (GA), 0. 2 % (GB), 0. 3 % (GC) and 0. 4 % (GD)), 0. 2 % commercial growth promoter (GP) and a controlled (C) diet according to NRC standards (1994) were used in this experiment. Thirty six hundred day old chicks of Japanese quail were randomly divided into six experimental units having six replicate of each with hundred birds in each replicate. Analysis of data through ANOVA technique in completely randomized design and the comparison of mean {{with the help of}} Duncan‚Äôs Multiple Range Test by using SAS 9. 1 revealed significant differences in terms of body weight with the highest value for group fed 0. 4 % Garlic and the lowest for 0. 2 % garlic.

40|$|Background: The inverted-T {{technique}} {{is the most}} popular skin pattern used for mastopexy, but short scar variations have increased in popularity over recent years. With respect to nipple elevation, superior, superomedial, medial, inferior, lateral, and central pedicle designs have been described. Objectives: We introduce a novel concept for mastopexy, the glandular Z-mammaplasty, and assess its anatomic and technical feasibility. Methods: Glandular Z-plasty was performed on 15 human female cadavers. Various parameters were measured pre- and postoperatively to assess degree of ptosis and subsequently compared by student t test. Results: Average pre and postoperative <b>breast</b> <b>width</b> (28. 5 ¬± 4. 7 cm, 26. 7 ¬± 3. 2 cm, P =. 009), breast length (25 ¬± 6. 6 cm and 21. 8 ¬± 4. 3 cm P =. 005), breast height (10. 7 ¬± 3. 7 cm and 9. 5 ¬± 2. 9 cm, P =. 02), and ptosis degree (1. 9 ¬± 0. 9 cm and 0. 3 ¬± 0. 5 cm, P <. 0001) were determined. Inferior limb transposition moved the nipple closer to the sternal notch and sternum midline an average of 5. 3 ¬± 2. 2 cm and 2. 4 ¬± 1. 7 cm, respectively. The average Z-plasty degree was 34. 5 ¬± 8. 2 ¬∞. The average central limb length was 8. 7 ¬± 2. 1, and the average pedicle width was 5. 4 ¬± 0. 8 cm. Buttress support of the nipple was accomplished by caudal transposition of the superior Z-plasty flap and its inset below the nipple. Conclusion: We demonstrate that glandular Z-mammaplasty is indeed feasible. The grade of ptosis was statistically significantly improved, with the nipple moving superiorly an average of 5. 3 cm in our study group...|$|E
