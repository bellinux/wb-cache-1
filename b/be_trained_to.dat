5|$|Asian {{elephants}} perform {{tasks such}} as hauling loads into remote areas, moving logs to rivers and roads, transporting tourists around national parks, pulling wagons, and leading religious processions. In northern Thailand, the animals are used to digest coffee beans for Black Ivory coffee. They are valued over mechanised tools because they can work in relatively deep water, require relatively little maintenance, need only vegetation and water as fuel and can <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> memorise specific tasks. Elephants can <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> respond to over 30 commands. Musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous {{to work with and}} are chained and semi-starved until the condition passes. In India, many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse. They and other captive elephants are thus protected under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{has also}} {{consistently}} {{been shown to}} play a role in reward learning, in all animal groups. As in all vertebrates – invertebrates such as roundworms, flatworms, molluscs and common fruit flies can all <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> repeat an action if it is consistently followed by an increase in dopamine levels.|$|E

5|$|The {{bird was}} also kept by Māori as a pet, {{and like the}} tui, it could <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> say a few words. There is also a record of a tame huia kept by European {{settlers}} in a small village in the Forty-Mile Bush in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The intelligence, domesticability and {{versatility}} of {{the elephant}} gave it considerable advantages over other wild {{animals such as}} lions and bears used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than horses: while a horse can <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of war elephants with generals such as Hannibal. Elephants can <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> execute prisoners {{in a variety of}} ways, and can be taught to prolong the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.|$|E
5|$|Although {{happy in}} the company of others, they are fine if left alone. Sealyham Terriers are suited for both the town and country. They can be stubborn, vocal, and boisterous but also full of personality. While they make for loyal family companions, they can <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> be working dogs, making them {{excellent}} mousers or ratters. They can also be taught as a puppy to get along with other animals, including cats and birds.|$|E

50|$|Dog surfing {{involves}} {{dogs that}} <b>are</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> surf on surfboards or bodyboards, either {{alone or with}} a human on the board. Some dogs have <b>been</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> ride a skimboard on the shore (after the board is initially skimmed by a human) and to windsurf with a human, and bodysurfing dogs have also been documented in surfing media. Additionally, some dogs have <b>been</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> ride on paddleboards with people.|$|R
5|$|Despite their {{relatively}} smaller brains {{compared to}} other primates, lemurs have demonstrated levels of technical intelligence in problem solving that are comparable to those seen in simians. However, their social intelligence differs, often emphasizing within-group competition over cooperation, which {{may be due to}} adaptations for their unpredictable environment. Although lemurs have not been observed using objects as tools in the wild, they can <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> use objects as tools in captivity and demonstrate a basic understanding about the functional properties of the objects they are using.|$|E
5|$|Though {{cetaceans}} {{have been}} held in captivity in both North America and Europe since the 1860s, the first being a pair of Beluga Whales in the New York City museum, dolphins were first kept for paid entertainment in the Marine Studios dolphinarium founded in 1938 in St. Augustine, Florida. It was here that {{it was discovered that}} dolphins could <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> perform tricks. Recognizing the success of Marine Studios, more dolphinariums began keeping dolphins for entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Rodents have {{sensitive}} olfactory abilities, {{which have}} been used by humans to detect odors or chemicals of interest. The Gambian pouched rat is able to detect tuberculosis bacilli with a sensitivity of up to 86.6%, and specificity (detecting the absence of the bacilli) of over 93%; the same species has been trained to detect land mines. Rats have been studied for possible use in hazardous situations such as in disaster zones. They can <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> respond to commands, which may be given remotely, and even persuaded to venture into brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid.|$|E
50|$|Service {{dogs are}} those that <b>are</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> help people with disabilities such as blindness, epilepsy, {{diabetes}} and autism. Detection dogs <b>are</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> using their sense of smell to detect substances such as explosives, illegal drugs, wildlife scat, or blood. In science, dogs have helped humans understand about the conditioned reflex. Attack dogs, dogs that have <b>been</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> attack on command, are employed in security, police, and military roles.|$|R

5|$|Sea lions are {{particularly}} intelligent, can <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> perform various tasks and display limited fear of humans if accustomed to them. Because of this, California sea lions are a popular choice for public display in zoos, circuses and oceanariums, and are {{trained by the}} United States Navy for certain military operations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as Least Concern due to its abundance. Predation by California sea lions on threatened or endangered salmon species at Bonneville Dam has resulted in more than 50 of them being killed by state officials.|$|E
5|$|The baggage camel {{should be}} robust and heavy. Studies have {{recommended}} the camel should have either a small {{or a large}} head with a narrow aquiline nose, prominent eyes and large lips. The neck should be medium to long so the head is held high. The chest should be deep and the hump should be well-developed with sufficient space behind it to accommodate the saddle. The hindlegs should be heavy, muscular and sturdy. The dromedary can <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> carry baggage {{from the age of}} five years, but must not be given heavy loads before the age of six. The hawia is a typical baggage saddle from Sudan. The methods of training the baggage camels are similar to those for riding camels.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs do not {{generally}} thrive when housed with other species. Housing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some (such as dogs) can <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic rabbits. Some published {{sources say that}} guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and Pasteurella), to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.|$|E
25|$|Three of {{the marine}} mammal teams <b>are</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> detect enemy sea mines, which {{constitute}} a major hazard to U.S. Navy ships. MK4 uses dolphins to detect and mark the location of tethered sea mines floating off the bottom, while MK7 dolphins <b>are</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> detect and mark the location of mines on the sea floor or buried in sediment. The MK8 team <b>is</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> swiftly identify safe corridors for the initial landing of troops ashore.|$|R

5|$|Since tool use is {{considered}} to be a key feature of primate intelligence, the apparent lack of this behavior in wild lemurs, as well as the lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce the perception that lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins. However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of tool functionality in both the ring-tailed lemur and the common brown lemur and discovered that, like monkeys, they used tools with functional properties (e.g., tool orientation or ease of use) instead of tools with nonfunctional features (e.g., color or texture). Although the ring-tailed lemur may not use tools in the wild, it can not only <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> use a tool, but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to use a tool may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use of tools may not have appeared until much later.|$|E
5|$|The Seafire, a name {{derived from}} sea, and Spitfire, was a naval {{version of the}} Spitfire {{specially}} adapted for operation from aircraft carriers. Although the Spitfire was not designed for the rough-and-tumble of carrier-deck operations, it was considered the best available fighter at the time. The basic Spitfire design did impose some limitations {{on the use of}} the aircraft as a carrier-based fighter; poor visibility over the nose, for example, meant that pilots had to <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> land with their heads out of the cockpit and looking along the port cowling of their Seafire. Like the Spitfire, the Seafire also had a relatively narrow undercarriage track, which meant that it was not ideally suited to deck operations. Early marks of Seafire had relatively few modifications to the standard Spitfire airframe; however cumulative front line experience meant that most of the later versions of the Seafire had strengthened airframes, folding wings, arrestor hooks and other modifications, culminating in the purpose-built Seafire F/FR Mk 47.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws {{also have a}} hoarse, drawn-out alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can <b>be</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> imitate human speech.|$|E
