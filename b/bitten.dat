5|$|In another case, 28-year-old British student Nathan Layton was <b>bitten</b> by a {{black mamba}} and {{died of a heart}} attack in less than an hour in March 2008. The black mamba had been found near a {{classroom}} at the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit, where Layton was training to be a safari guide. Layton was <b>bitten</b> by the snake on his index finger while it was being put into a jar, but he didn't realize he'd been <b>bitten.</b> He thought the snake had only brushed his hand. Approximately 30 minutes after being <b>bitten</b> Layton complained of blurred vision. He collapsed and {{died of a heart attack}}, nearly an hour after being <b>bitten.</b> Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.|$|E

5000|$|A dry <b>bite</b> is a <b>bite</b> by a venomous {{animal in}} which no venom is released. Dry snake <b>bites</b> are called [...] "Venomous snake <b>bite</b> without envenoming". Dry <b>bites</b> can occur from all snakes, but their {{frequency}} varies from species to species. For example, Australian eastern brown snakes (Pseudonaja textilis) can inflict dry <b>bites</b> 80% of the time while taipans inflict dry <b>bites</b> only 5% of the time. About 25% of snakebite cases can be dry <b>bites.</b> They are characterized by fang and tooth marks {{and the absence of}} injected venom.|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{applying}} map and filter functions on consecutive sublists {{instead of on}} individual list elements is discussed and developed in this paper. A non-empty, consecutive sublist is called a <b>bite.</b> Both map and filter functions accept a function parameter- a <b>bite</b> function- {{which is responsible for}} returning a prefix <b>bite</b> of a list. We develop families of <b>bite</b> functions via a collection of higher-order <b>bite</b> generators. On top of the <b>bite</b> generators, a number of <b>bite</b> mapping and <b>bite</b> filtering functions are introduced. We illustrate the usefulness of <b>bite</b> mapping and filtering via examples drawn from a functional programming library that processes music, represented as Standard MIDI Files...|$|R
5|$|The local {{symptoms}} of victims <b>bitten</b> by the many-banded krait are usually neither serious swelling nor pain; the victims merely feel slightly itchy and numb. Systemic symptoms occur, in general, one {{to six hours}} after being <b>bitten</b> by this snake. Symptoms may include bilateral ptosis, diplopia, discomfort in the chest, general ache, weak feeling in limbs, ataxia, glossolysis, loss of voice, dysphagia, tunnel vision, and difficulty breathing. In case of serious bite, suppression of breathing may occur, leading to death. Hyponatremia is also seen, but less commonly.|$|E

5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often <b>bitten</b> on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being <b>bitten</b> include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E
5|$|Children and infants may {{be unable}} to report being <b>bitten,</b> making it {{difficult}} to associate their symptoms with a spider bite. Symptoms seen in infants include inconsolable crying, refusing to feed and a general erythematous rash. Muscle aches and pains, and neck spasm are often seen in children over four years of age.|$|E
5|$|Envenomation from a redback spider bite {{produces}} a syndrome known as latrodectism. A {{small but significant}} percentage of people <b>bitten</b> develop significant pain or systemic symptoms. The diagnosis is made from the clinical condition, often based on the victim being aware of a bite and ideally with identification of the spider. Laboratory tests are rarely needed {{and there is no}} specific test for the venom or latrodectism.|$|E
40|$|The 892 human <b>bites</b> {{reported}} to the New York City Department of Health in 1977 were analyzed by time, place, and the victim's characteristics. The <b>bites</b> appeared to have a seasonality, increasing in March and exceeding the mean monthly average through August. The <b>bite</b> rate for the entire city, 10. 7 per 100, 000 population, was exceeded in 5 of the 10 Brooklyn health districts; one of these districts reported a rate of 60. 9 human <b>bites</b> per 100, 000 population. Most of the <b>bites</b> with identifiable locations occurred indoors (63. 2 percent). In 72. 8 percent of the <b>bite</b> episodes in which the activities surrounding them were known, these activities were aggressive in nature. Males exceeded females as <b>bite</b> victims in all age groups except those 10 - 20 and 55 - 60 years. <b>Bites</b> of the upper extremity accounted for 61. 2 {{percent of the total}} <b>bites.</b> Left-sided <b>bites</b> exceeded right-sided, except for the hand. In frequency of reported occurrence, the human <b>bite</b> ranks third, after the dog <b>bite</b> and the cat <b>bite.</b> Human <b>bites</b> may be a useful indicator of antisocial behavior...|$|R

5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Homer begins to {{decorate}} the house for Halloween and is reaching for a decoration in a box. Unfortunately, {{there is a real}} Black Widow spider in the box and when Homer grabs what he thinks is a plastic spider, he is <b>bitten</b> by it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again <b>bitten</b> by another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still unable to move or talk.|$|E

40|$|Here, we {{document}} in-vivo <b>bite</b> forces recorded {{from wild}} piranhas. Integrating this empirical data with allometry, <b>bite</b> simulations, and FEA, we have reconstructed the <b>bite</b> capabilities and potential feeding {{ecology of the}} extinct giant Miocene piranha, Megapiranha paranensis. An anterior <b>bite</b> force of 320 N from the black piranha, Serrasalmus rhombeus, is the strongest <b>bite</b> force recorded for any bony fish to date. Results indicate M. paranensis' <b>bite</b> force conservatively ranged from 1240 - 4749 N and reveal its novel dentition was capable of resisting high <b>bite</b> stresses and crushing vertebrate bone. Comparisons of body size-scaled <b>bite</b> forces to other apex predators reveal S. rhombeus and M. paranensis have among the most powerful <b>bites</b> estimated in carnivorous vertebrates. Our results functionally demonstrate the extraordinary <b>bite</b> of serrasalmid piranhas and provide a mechanistic rationale for their predatory dominance among past and present Amazonian ichthyofaunas...|$|R
