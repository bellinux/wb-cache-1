40|$|This paper {{reports the}} process and {{computer}} methodology for a physics-based prediction of overall deformation and local failure modes in cooled turbine airfoils, <b>blade</b> <b>outer</b> <b>air</b> <b>seals,</b> and other turbomachinery parts operating in severe high temperature and high stress environments. The computational analysis work incorporated time-accurate, coupled aerothermal computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with nonlinear deformation thermal-structural finite element model (FEM) with a slip-based constitutive model, eval-uated at real engine characteristic mission times, and flight points for part life prediction. The methodology utilizes a fully coupled elastic-viscoplastic model {{that was based on}} crys-tal morphology, and a semi-empirical life prediction model introduced the use of dissipated energy to estimate the remaining part life in terms of cycles to failure. The method was effective for use with three-dimensional FEMs of realistic turbine airfoils using commercial finite element applications. The computationally predicted part life was calibrated and veri-fied against test data for deformation and crack growth. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4028568]...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} percentage of high bypass ratio, turbofan engine performance deterioration was caused {{by an increase in}} operating clearance between fan/compressor and turbine <b>blades</b> and their <b>outer</b> <b>air</b> <b>seals.</b> These increased clearances resulted from rubs induced by a combination of engine power transients and aircraft flight loads. An analytical technique for predicting the effect of quasi-steady state aircraft flight loads on engine performance deterioration was developed and is presented. Thrust, aerodynamic and inertia loads were considered. Analytical results are shown and compared to actual engine test experience...|$|R
40|$|Simulation of {{unsteady}} viscous turbomachinery flowfields {{is presently}} impractical as a design tool {{due to the}} long run times required. Designers rely predominantly on steady-state simulations, but these simulations do not account {{for some of the}} important unsteady flow physics. Unsteady flow effects can be modeled as source terms in the steady flow equations. These source terms, referred to as Lumped Deterministic Stresses (LDS), can be used to drive steady flow solution procedures to reproduce the time-average of an unsteady flow solution. The goal of this work is to investigate the feasibility of using inviscid lumped deterministic stresses to model unsteady combustion hot streak migration effects on the turbine <b>blade</b> tip and <b>outer</b> <b>air</b> <b>seal</b> heat loads using a steady computational approach. The LDS model is obtained from an unsteady inviscid calculation. The LDS model is then used with a steady viscous computation to simulate the time-averaged viscous solution. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional applications are examined. The inviscid LDS model produces good results for the two-dimensional case and requires less than 10 % of the CPU time of the unsteady viscous run. For the three-dimensional case, the LDS model does a good job of reproducing the time-averaged viscous temperature migration and separation as well as heat load on the <b>outer</b> <b>air</b> <b>seal</b> at a CPU cost that is 25 % of that of an unsteady viscous computation...|$|R
40|$|Method for {{controlling}} {{the clearance between}} rotating and stationary components of a gas turbine engine are disclosed. Techniques for achieving close correspondence between the radial position of rotor blade tips and the circumscribing <b>outer</b> <b>air</b> <b>seals</b> are disclosed. In one embodiment turbine case temperature modifying air is provided in flow rate, pressure and temperature varied {{as a function of}} engine operating condition. The modifying air is scheduled from a modulating and mixing valve supplied with dual source compressor air. One source supplies relatively low pressure, low temperature air and the other source supplies relatively high pressure, high temperature air. After the air has been used for the active clearance control (cooling the high pressure turbine case) it is then used for cooling the structure that supports the <b>outer</b> <b>air</b> <b>seal</b> and other high pressure turbine component parts...|$|R
40|$|The Army Propulsion Directorate is {{primarily}} concerned with small engine technology, where sealing performance is most critical. Tip leakage and secondary flow losses have a much greater performance impact on small engine aero-components than on large engines. A brief survey and critique of presently employed sealing concepts is presented. Some recent new research thrusts that show promise for substantial improvement are discussed. An especially promising approach for small engine applications is brush seals.

40|$|The JT 8 D high {{pressure}} turbine was revised to reduce leakage between the blade tip shrouds and the <b>outer</b> <b>air</b> <b>seal,</b> and engine testing {{was performed to}} determine the effect on performance. The addition of a second knife-edge on the blade tip shroud, the extension of the honeycomb seal land to cover the added knife-edge and an existing spoiler on the shroud, and a material substitution in the seal support ring to improve thermal growth characteristics are included. A relocation of the blade cooling air discharge to insure adequate cooling flow is required. Significant specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature improvements were demonstrated with the revised turbine in sea level and simulated altitude engine tests. Inspection of the revised seal hardware after these tests showed no unusual wear or degradation...|$|R
40|$|The high {{mechanical}} reliability and low deterioration {{rate of the}} JT 9 D high-pressure compressor results in long utilization without exceeding engine operational limits. The increasing cost and decreasing supply of fuel have focused attention on the fuel burned implications of such high time use without refurbishment. The paper {{presents the results of}} JT 9 D high pressure compressor studies. The mechanical deterioration of the JT 9 D high-pressure compressor gaspath parts versus increasing service usage, documented from inspection of service parts, is presented and discussed including changes in airfoil roughness, blade length, airfoil contour and <b>outer</b> <b>air</b> <b>seal</b> trench characteristics. An estimate of the performance loss versus usage is related to each type of damage. The combined estimated high-pressure compressor performance loss for all mechanisms determined from part inspection is compared to historical engine test data to establish the validity of the predicted loss levels. The effect of cold section refurbishment on engine fuel consumption recovery and the results of an optimization study to determine the appropriate interval for high pressure compressor refurbishment are also reported...|$|R

50|$|The S6 {{respirator}} provided {{protection to}} the face, eyes, lung and throat of the wearer against all known chemical agents of that time. The filter of the respirator did not filter out carbon dioxide. The S6 features an innovative <b>air</b> <b>seal</b> around {{the inside of}} the face piece to improve the fit and comfort of the mask; a tap inside the nose cup was to allow the equalisation of pressure inside the <b>air</b> <b>seal,</b> in different climatic conditions. The wearers natural body heat would then warm the trapped air to inflate the <b>air</b> <b>seal,</b> thus getting a better seal around the face. The mask could also be made to benefit left-handed people, where the filter canister is positioned on the right of the face mask instead of the left. The location of the filter on the left or right side of the mask was to allow the rifle to be shouldered, aimed and fired correctly.|$|R
