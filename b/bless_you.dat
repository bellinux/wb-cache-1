5|$|Vonnegut {{published}} his first novel, Player Piano, in 1952. The novel was reviewed positively, {{but was not}} commercially successful. In the nearly 20 years that followed, Vonnegut published several novels that were only marginally successful, such as Cat's Cradle (1963) and God <b>Bless</b> <b>You,</b> Mr. Rosewater (1964). Vonnegut's magnum opus, however, was his immediately successful sixth novel, Slaughterhouse-Five. The book's antiwar sentiment resonated with its readers amidst the ongoing Vietnam War, and its reviews were generally positive. After its release, Slaughterhouse-Five went {{to the top of}} The New York Times Best Seller list, thrusting Vonnegut into fame. He was invited to give speeches, lectures, and commencement addresses around the country and received many awards and honors.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong concluded: The {{responsibility}} for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We {{would like to give}} special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God <b>bless</b> <b>you.</b> Good night from Apollo 11.|$|E

25|$|Eliot Rosewater: Billy befriends {{him in the}} veterans' hospital; he {{introduces}} Billy to the sci fi {{novels of}} Kilgore Trout. Rosewater wrote the only fan letter Trout ever received. Rosewater had also suffered a terrible event during the war. They find the Trout novels help them deal with the trauma. Rosewater is a character featured in other books by Kurt Vonnegut, such as God <b>Bless</b> <b>You,</b> Mr. Rosewater.|$|E
25|$|The {{execution}} {{by lethal}} injection began at 10:53pm EDT. In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying:Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God <b>bless</b> <b>you</b> all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E

500|$|Vonnegut based {{the title}} {{character}} of God <b>Bless</b> <b>You,</b> Mr. Rosewater (1964), on an accountant he knew on Cape Cod, who specialized in clients in trouble and often had to comfort them. Eliot Rosewater, the wealthy son of a Republican senator, seeks to atone for his wartime killing of noncombatant firefighters by serving in a volunteer fire department, and by giving away money to those in trouble or need. Stress from a battle for control of his charitable foundation pushes him over the edge, and he is placed in a mental hospital. He recovers, and ends the financial battle by declaring the children of his county to be his heirs. Allen deemed God <b>Bless</b> <b>You,</b> Mr. Rosewater more [...] "a cry from the heart than a novel under its author's full intellectual control", that reflected family and emotional stresses Vonnegut was going through at the time.|$|E

500|$|The duet aria, [...] "" [...] (May the Lord <b>bless</b> <b>you</b> {{more and}} more, {{you and your}} children), {{is based on a}} single line of text. The violins play an {{imitative}} motif that does not align with the vocal phrases. the movement has been described as calm and [...] "gently-swaying". Mincham notes a subtle growth [...] "in the imitative opening motives of the violins taken, incidentally, from the sinfonia and dominating this movement throughout".|$|E
500|$|Rumfoord, who {{is based}} on Franklin D. Roosevelt, also {{physically}} resembles the former president. Rumfoord is described, [...] "he put a cigarette in a long, bone cigarette holder, lighted it. He thrust out his jaw. The cigarette holder pointed straight up." [...] William Rodney Allen, in his guide to Vonnegut's works, stated that Rumfoord foreshadowed the fictional political figures who would play major roles in God <b>Bless</b> <b>You,</b> Mr. Rosewater and Jailbird.|$|E

500|$|Skelton and Marcel Marceau {{shared a}} long {{friendship}} and admiration of each other's work. [...] Marceau appeared on Skelton's CBS television show three times, including one turn {{as the host}} in 1961 as Skelton recovered from surgery. He was also a guest on the three Funny Faces specials that Skelton produced for HBO. [...] In a TV Guide interview after Skelton's death, Marceau said, [...] "Red, you are eternal for me and {{the millions of people}} you made laugh and cry. [...] May God <b>bless</b> <b>you</b> forever, my great and precious companion. [...] I will never forget that silent world we created together." [...] CBS issued the following statement upon his death: [...] "Red's audience had no age limits. [...] He was the consummate family entertainer—a winsome clown, a storyteller without peer, a superb mime, a singer and a dancer." ...|$|E
500|$|The Orb, now {{composed}} of Paterson, Phillips, and Fehlmann, with guest John Roome, accepted {{an invitation to}} join the [...] concert tour with Moby, Paul Oakenfold, New Order and other alternative and electronic artists. Though the Orb were paired with more mainstream artists during the tour such as Incubus, Paterson and Fehlmann made their next releases a series of several low-key EPs for German label Kompakt in 2002. The Orb found critical success on Kompakt; but Badorb.com collapsed soon after releasing the compilation <b>Bless</b> <b>You.</b> Badorb.com had released fourteen records {{over the course of}} fourteen months from artists including Guy Pratt (Conduit), Ayumi Hamasaki, and Takayuki Shiraishi, as well as the Orb's three-track Daleth of Elphame EP. Though Badorb.com was an internet-based record label, they only sold vinyl releases (with one exception, the Orb EP), which Paterson later remarked was a poor idea because [...] "not many people... have record players".|$|E
500|$|Religion {{features}} {{frequently in}} Vonnegut's work, both in his novels and elsewhere. He laced {{a number of}} his speeches with religion-focused rhetoric, and was prone to using such expressions as [...] "God forbid" [...] and [...] "thank God". He once wrote his own version of the Requiem Mass, which he then had translated into Latin and set to music. In God <b>Bless</b> <b>You,</b> Dr. Kevorkian, Vonnegut goes to heaven after he is euthanized by Dr. Jack Kevorkian. Once in heaven, he interviews 21 deceased celebrities, including Isaac Asimov, William Shakespeare, and Kilgore Trout—the last a fictional character from several of his novels. Vonnegut's works are filled with characters founding new faiths, and religion often serves as a major plot device, for example in Player Piano, The Sirens of Titan and Cat's Cradle. In The Sirens of Titan, Rumfoord proclaims The Church of God the Utterly Indifferent. Slaughterhouse-Five sees Billy Pilgrim, lacking religion himself, nevertheless become a chaplain's assistant in the military and display a large crucifix on his bedroom wall. In Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut invented the religion of Bokononism.|$|E

500|$|Hardy came belowdecks to see Nelson {{just after}} half-past two, and {{informed}} him {{that a number of}} enemy ships had surrendered. Nelson told him that he was sure to die, and begged him to pass his possessions to Emma. With Nelson at this point were the chaplain Alexander Scott, the purser Walter Burke, Nelson's steward, Chevalier, and Beatty. Nelson, fearing that a gale was blowing up, instructed Hardy to be sure to anchor. After reminding him to [...] "take care of poor Lady Hamilton", Nelson said [...] "Kiss me, Hardy". Beatty recorded that Hardy knelt and kissed Nelson on the cheek. He then stood {{for a minute or two}} before kissing him on the forehead. Nelson asked, [...] "Who is that?", and on hearing that it was Hardy, he replied [...] "God <b>bless</b> <b>you,</b> Hardy." [...] By now very weak, Nelson continued to murmur instructions to Burke and Scott, [...] "fan, fan... rub, rub... drink, drink." [...] Beatty heard Nelson murmur, [...] "Thank God I have done my duty", and when he returned, Nelson's voice had faded and his pulse was very weak. He looked up as Beatty took his pulse, then closed his eyes. Scott, who remained by Nelson as he died, recorded his last words as [...] "God and my country". Nelson died at half-past four, three hours after he had been shot.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{appeared}} on stage wearing a floor-length white gown with micro-sequins from designer Marc Bouwer's pre-fall collection while {{her hair was}} {{pulled back in a}} sleek ponytail. She performed on a high-rise stage with a big screen spanning from ceiling to floor behind her. As she sang, the screen filled with images of U.N. aid workers on the scene in various wars, famines, and floods around the world. Following the performance, she announced, [...] "I'd like to ask everyone to make sure they're a part of August 19th... It's such a beautiful, beautiful day, and I'd like to honor the 22 people who lost their lives. God <b>bless</b> <b>you</b> all. Thank you so much for having me." [...] The music video for the song starts with Beyoncé singing the song with the U.N. audience seated in front of her, and images from recent disasters screening in panoramic view behind her. As the song progresses, scenes of globes and constellations turn up; laser lights and a small blue arrow, imprinted with the song's title, trace a path along the globe. The performance footage is also mixed with images of global volunteer efforts; as the giant screen displays globe-reaching graphics they morph into pictures of humanitarian work. The music video ends with the question [...] "What Will You Do?" [...] and offers the official website for the World Humanitarian Day.|$|E
500|$|Delft, {{captured}} {{in the early stages}} of the battle, was under the command of the Dutch Lieutenant Heilberg and the British Lieutenant Charles Bullen, with a small prize crew of 69 men. Ninety-three Dutch prisoners had been removed, and among the remaining Dutch sailors were 76 wounded men. As the gale intensified, it rapidly became clear that despite a tow line attached from Veteran the ship would never reach Britain, and a large board was raised on deck with the chalked message [...] "The ship is sinking". Reacting at once, boats from nearby ships organised an evacuation and began loading the Dutch prisoners for transfer to more seaworthy vessels. Bullen offered a place in the first rescue boat, from Veteran, to Heilberg, but the Dutch officer refused, gesturing to the immobile wounded who had been brought onto the maindeck as the lower decks had flooded and replying [...] "But how can I leave these men?". In response, Bullen cried out [...] "God <b>bless</b> <b>you,</b> my brave fellow! Here is my hand; I give you my word I will stay her with you!". The prize crew left on the second rescue boat sent from Russell, and Bullen and Heilberg waited for a third trip to bring them off with the remaining 30 wounded men and three junior Dutch officers who had also elected to stay. Before further help could arrive, however, Delft suddenly foundered, Bullen and Heilberg throwing themselves clear as the ship sank. Both were seen in the water but only Bullen reached safety, swimming to Monmouth alone.|$|E
