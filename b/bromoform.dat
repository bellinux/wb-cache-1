50|$|Bromoform's {{high density}} makes it useful for {{separation}} of minerals by density. When two samples are mixed with <b>bromoform</b> and then allowed to settle, the top layer will contain minerals less dense than <b>bromoform,</b> and the bottom layer will contain denser minerals. Slightly less dense minerals can be separated {{in the same way}} by mixing the <b>bromoform</b> {{with a small amount of}} a less dense and fully miscible solvent.|$|E

5000|$|Natural {{production}} of <b>bromoform</b> by phytoplankton and seaweeds {{in the ocean}} {{is thought to be}} its predominant source in the environment. However, locally significant amounts of <b>bromoform</b> enter the environment formed as disinfection byproducts known as trihalomethanes when chlorine is added to drinking water to kill bacteria. It is somewhat soluble in water and readily evaporates into the air. <b>Bromoform</b> is the main trihalomethane produced in beachfront salt water swimming pools with concentrations as high as 1.2 ppm (parts per million). Concentrations in freshwater pools are 1000 times lower. [...] Occupational skin exposure limits are set at 0.5 ppm.|$|E

50|$|Research {{has shown}} that because {{saltwater}} pools still use chlorine sanitization, they generate the same disinfection byproducts (DBPs) that are present in traditional pools. Of highest concern are haloketones and trihalomethanes (THMs) of those the predominant form being <b>bromoform.</b> Very high levels of <b>bromoform</b> - up to 1.3 mg / liter or 13 times the guideline values of World Health Organization - {{have been found in}} some public saltwater swimming pools.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bromoform</b> (CHBr3) is a {{brominated}} organic solvent, colorless liquid at room temperature, {{with a high}} refractive index, {{very high}} density, and sweet odor {{is similar to that}} of chloroform. It is a trihalomethane, and is one of the four haloforms, the others being fluoroform, chloroform, and iodoform. <b>Bromoform</b> can be prepared by the haloform reaction using acetone and sodium hypobromite, by the electrolysis of potassium bromide in ethanol, or by treating chloroform with aluminium bromide. Currently its main use is as a laboratory reagent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bromoform</b> can {{be absorbed}} into the body by {{inhalation}} and through the skin. The substance is irritating to the respiratory tract, the eyes, and the skin, and may cause effects on {{the central nervous system}} and liver, resulting in impaired functions. It is soluble in about 800 parts water and is miscible with alcohol, benzene, chloroform, ether, petroleum ether, acetone, and oils. Its LD50 is 7.2 mmol/kg in mice, or 1.8g/kg. <b>Bromoform</b> is a confirmed animal carcinogen; (ACGIH 2004). Carcinogen category: 3B; (DFG 2004).|$|E

5000|$|Disinfection by {{chlorination}} can be problematic, in some circumstances. Chlorine {{can react}} with naturally occurring organic compounds {{found in the}} water supply to produce compounds known as disinfection by-products (DBPs). The most common DBPs are trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). Trihalomethanes are the main disinfectant by-products created from chlorination with two different types, <b>bromoform</b> and dibromochloromethane, which are mainly responsible for health hazards. Their effects depend strictly on the duration of their exposure to the chemicals and the amount ingested into the body. In high doses, <b>bromoform</b> mainly slows down regular brain activity, which is manifested by symptoms such as sleepiness or sedation. Chronic exposure of both <b>bromoform</b> and dibromochloromethane can cause liver and kidney cancer, as well as heart disease, unconsciousness, or death in high doses. Due to the potential carcinogenicity of these compounds, drinking water regulations across the developed world require regular monitoring of the concentration of these compounds in the distribution systems of municipal water systems. The World Health Organization has stated that [...] "the risks to health from these by-products are extremely small {{in comparison with the}} risks associated with inadequate disinfection".|$|E
5000|$|Organobromine {{compounds}} are {{the most}} common organohalides in nature. Even though the concentration of bromide is only 0.3% of that for chloride in sea water, organobromine compounds are more prevalent in marine organisms than organochlorine derivatives. Their abundance reflects the easy oxidation of bromide to the equivalent of Br+, a potent electrophile. The enzyme bromoperoxidase catalyzes this reaction. [...] The oceans are estimated to release 1-2 million tons of <b>bromoform</b> and 56,000 tons of bromomethane annually. Red algae, such as the edible Asparagopsis taxiformis, eaten in Hawaii as [...] "limu kohu", concentrate organobromine and organoiodine compounds in [...] "vesicle cells"; 95% of the essential volatile oil of Asparagopsis, prepared by drying the seaweed in a vacuum and condensing using dry ice, is organohalogen compounds, of which <b>bromoform</b> comprises 80% by weight. <b>Bromoform,</b> produced by several algae, is a known toxin, though the small amounts present in edible algae do not appear to pose human harm. [...] Some of these organobromine compounds are employed in a form of interspecies [...] "chemical warfare." [...] 5-Bromouracil and 3-Bromo-tyrosine have been identified in human white blood cells as products of myeloperoxidase-induced halogenation on invading pathogens.|$|E
50|$|Only small {{quantities}} of <b>bromoform</b> are currently produced industrially in the United States. In the past, {{it was used}} as a solvent, sedative and flame retardant, but now it is mainly used as a laboratory reagent, for example as an extraction solvent.|$|E
50|$|As heavy {{minerals}} are a minor constituent of most sedimentary rock, {{they must be}} separated out to be studied. Heavy mineral separation generally uses a dense liquid in either a separatory funnel or centrifuge. Liquids used include <b>bromoform,</b> tetrabromoethane, tribromoethane, methylene iodide, and polytungstate liquids.|$|E
50|$|Organobromine {{compounds}} are {{the most}} common organohalides in nature. Their formation is catalyzed by the enzyme bromoperoxidase which utilizes bromide in combination with oxygen as an oxidant.

5000|$|The {{bromination}} acts on {{a variety}} of organic substrates. The vanadium bromoperoxidases produce an estimated 1-2 million tons of <b>bromoform</b> and 56,000 tons of bromomethane annually. [...] Most of the earth's organobromine compounds arise by the action of this enzyme. The enzyme forms singlet oxygen {{in the absence of the}} appropriate organic substrates.|$|E
50|$|Bromoacetone is {{prepared}} by combining bromine and acetone, with catalytic acid. As with all ketones, acetone enolizes {{in the presence}} of acids or bases. The alpha carbon then undergoes electrophilic substitution with bromine. The main difficulty with this method is over-bromination, resulting in di- and tribrominated products. If a base is present, <b>bromoform</b> is obtained instead, via the haloform reaction.|$|E

50|$|Amyl nitrites {{are also}} useful as {{reagents}} in {{a modification of}} the Sandmeyer reaction. The reaction of the alkyl nitrite with an aromatic amine in a halogenated solvent produces a radical aromatic species, this then frees a halogen atom from the solvent. For the synthesis of aryl iodides diiodomethane is used, whereas <b>bromoform</b> is the solvent of choice for the synthesis of aryl bromides.|$|E
50|$|The {{haloform}} {{reaction is}} a chemical reaction where a haloform (CHX3, where X is a halogen) {{is produced by}} the exhaustive halogenation of a methyl ketone (a molecule containing the R-CO-CH3 group) {{in the presence of}} a base. R may be alkyl or aryl. The reaction can be used to transform acetyl groups into carboxyl groups or to produce chloroform (CHCl3), <b>bromoform</b> (CHBr3), or iodoform (CHI3).|$|E
5000|$|This use of lithium {{and sodium}} {{tungstate}} anions {{was developed in}} the 1980s and early 1990s to address toxicity and safety issues with the existing organic high density fluids. Unlike methylene iodide and <b>bromoform,</b> polytungstates and heteropolytungstates can be more safely be used in an indoor environment without a fume hood with only ordinary common sense safety precautions such as protective gloves and safety glasses.|$|E
5000|$|The {{classical}} heavy liquids like 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane (Muthmanns solution), potassium tetraiodomercurate(II) (Thoulets solution), <b>bromoform</b> or diiodomethane {{which are}} used in mineralogy are very toxic. These toxic chemicals are avoided today in consideration {{of the fact that}} there are alternative water based, non-toxic heavy liquids like sodium polytungstate solutions. With this relatively new heavy liquid densities up to 3.1 g·cm−3 can be adjusted [...] Adding parts of pulverulent Tungsten carbide increases the density to 4.6 g·cm−3.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} uses of the Sandmeyer reaction is the formation of aryl halides. The solvent of choice for the synthesis of aryl iodides is diiodomethane, while for the synthesis of aryl bromides, <b>bromoform</b> is used. For the synthesis of aryl chlorides, chloroform is the solvent of choice. The synthesis of (+)-curcuphenol, a bioactive compound that displays antifungal and anticancer activity, employs the Sandmeyer reaction to substitute an amine group by a bromo group.|$|E
5000|$|Takai olefination {{in organic}} {{chemistry}} describes the organic reaction of an aldehyde with a diorganochromium compound {{to form an}} alkene. In the original 1986 publication the aldehyde is benzaldehyde and the organochromium species is generated from iodoform or <b>bromoform</b> and an excess of chromium(II) chloride. The reaction product is a vinyl halide. The main selling point is the E-configuration of the double bond. According to the principal investigator Kazuhiko Takai, existing alternatives such as the Wittig reaction only yield mixtures.|$|E

50|$|NC State University (Lot 86, Farm Unit 1) is a Superfund site in Raleigh, North Carolina located to {{the north}} of Carter-Finley Stadium. It is a 1.5 acre site that was used from 1969 until 1980 to dispose of {{hazardous}} waste from laboratories and research facilities. The North Carolina State University Department of Marine, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences began monitoring the site in 1981, drilling wells and sampling the groundwater. Groundwater remediation is currently being conducted at the site via pump and treat methods to remove chemicals of concern, including chloroform, <b>bromoform,</b> 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and methylene chloride.|$|E
5000|$|It has {{an unusually}} high density for an organic compound, near 3 g/mL, due largely to the four bromine atoms. TBE is a liquid at room temperature, and is used to {{separate}} mineral ores from its supporting rock by means of preferential flotation. Sand, limestone, dolomite, {{and other types of}} rock material will float on TBE, while minerals such as sphalerite, galena and pyrite will sink. A related compound, <b>bromoform,</b> is also sometimes used in these applications, however, TBE is more practical because of its wider liquid range and lower vapor pressure. [...] Acute TBE poisoning has been known to occur.|$|E
50|$|Methods of {{separation}} by specific gravity have a still wider application. The simplest {{of these is}} levigation, which is extensively employed in mechanical analysis of soils and treatment of ores, but is not so successful with rocks, as their components do not, as a rule, differ greatly in specific gravity. Fluids are used that do not attack most rock-forming minerals, but have a high specific gravity. Solutions of potassium mercuric iodide (sp. gr. 3.196), cadmium borotungstate (sp. gr. 3.30), methylene iodide (sp. gr. 3.32), <b>bromoform</b> (sp. gr. 2.86), or acetylene bromide (sp. gr. 3.00) are the principal fluids employed. They may be diluted (with water, benzene, etc.) or concentrated by evaporation.|$|E
