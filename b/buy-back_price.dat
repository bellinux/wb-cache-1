40|$|Considering {{a supply}} chain with fashion {{products}} comprising of a supplier and a retailer, we study the sustainability of the supply chain with alternative power structures (either the supplier or the retailer has the option of acting as a leader {{to make the decisions}} first). We also examine the impact of the supplier’s attitudes to loss on the supply chain’s sustainability and profitability. We build game theoretical modes to characterize one property of the fashion industry: the wide use of buy-back contract, and obtain the following results: (1) Compared to wholesale price contract, buy-back contract reduces the sustainability of the supply chain, and this result is robust with alternative power structures. (2) Under alternative power structure, the sustainability index is increasing in the <b>buy-back</b> <b>price</b> in the supplier-as-the-leader scenario, while decreasing in the retailer-as-the-leader scenario. That is, the relationships between sustainability and <b>buy-back</b> <b>price</b> is completely reversed when the leader is changed. (3) The sustainability is improved when the supplier acts as the leader and the <b>buy-back</b> <b>price</b> is lower than a threshold, but the contrary holds when the <b>buy-back</b> <b>price</b> is high. (4) Buy-back contract helps to improve the sustainability of the supply chain when supplier is extremely loss-averse, because the loss-averse supplier has the incentives to reduce the ordering quantity as well as the overstocking risk...|$|E

40|$|Recently, price {{contract}} models between {{suppliers and}} retailers, with stochastic demand have been analyzed based on well-known newsvendor problems. In Bernstein and Federgruen [6], they have analyzed a contract model with single supplier and multiples retailers and price dependent demand, where retailers compete on retail prices. Each retailer decides {{a number of}} products he procures from the supplier and his retail price to maximize his own profit. This is achieved after giving the wholesale and <b>buy-back</b> <b>prices,</b> which {{are determined by the}} supplier as the supplier’s profit is maximized. Bernstein and Federgruen have proved that the retail prices become a unique Nash equilibrium solution under weak conditions on the price dependent distribution of demand. The authors, however, have not mentioned the numerical values and proprieties on these retail prices, the number of products and their individual and overall profits. In this paper, we analyze the model numerically. We first indicate some numerical problems with respect to theorem of Nash equilibrium solutions, which Bernstein and Federgruen proved, and we show their modified results. Then, we compute numerically Nash equilibrium prices, optimal wholesale and <b>buy-back</b> <b>prices</b> for the supplier’s and retailers’ profits, and supply chain optimal retailers’ prices. We also discuss properties on relation between these values and the demand distribution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We study a one-{{manufacturer}} and one-retailer type {{of supply}} chain that the manufacturer manufactures two newsvendor-type items {{and offers a}} buy-back contractual commitment to the retailer who sells the items in a stochastic demand market with various prices, allowing demand leakage from high-priced item to low-priced one. The objective {{of this study is}} to coordinate the chain by jointly determining wholesale <b>prices,</b> <b>buy-back</b> <b>prices,</b> retail prices and order sizes. We first derive a succinct model for the chain in which the manufacturers expected profit subject to the retailer’s optimal expected profit will be explored. And a solution method to the case of uniformly distributed error demand is subsequently proposed; accordingly, a series of examples along with graphical concavity and satisfying constraint of the manufacturer’s expected profit are conducted to validate our solution method...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater pumping for {{irrigation}} has exploded across India since the 1970 ’s {{largely due to}} a proliferation of cheap pump sets and highly subsidized energy. In much of Western and peninsular India, aquifers have been overexploited with substantial decreases in water tables leading to even higher amounts of energy used for pumping. As solar irrigation pumps become more effective and affordable, the prospect of uncontrolled solar pumping further exacerbating the unsustainable use of groundwater has led to calls by some {{for the government to}} buy back excess electricity generated on farms. Under such a scheme, the <b>buy-back</b> <b>price</b> would have to be high enough to make selling the power more profitable than using it for further irrigation, yet not as high as the price that is charged for electricity from the grid lest an opportunity for arbitrage be created. The correct value for the <b>buy-back</b> <b>price</b> will thus depend on the marginal profitability of water use on the farm with the possibility that the value of water to the farmer may be too high to make the scheme feasible. In this paper, estimates of water and electricity demand are derived for Punjab state and used to inform what an effective buyback scheme might entail. Results indicate that a <b>buy-back</b> <b>price</b> differentiated by season and location might be an affordable way to promote groundwater conservation...|$|E
40|$|Firms {{engaged in}} {{remanufacturing}} activities generally adopt {{more than one}} recycling channel to collect more used products and gain more profits. This paper explores the optimal strategies for a retailer-dominated closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) with a triple recycling channel in the construction machinery remanufacturing context. In this special system, the retailer is the leader and authorized by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to remanufacture. Moreover, the OEM, the retailer, and the secondary market all {{take part in the}} used products collection activities. Considering the differentiation of the OEM, the retailer, and the secondary market in collecting the used construction machinery, a mathematical model of the CLSC system based on reasonable assumptions is built, the closed-form optimal pricing decisions are derived, and the optimal collection efforts allocation strategies are explored {{within the framework of the}} game theory. In addition, the impacts of the reverse logistics cost coefficient, the competing coefficient, and the <b>buy-back</b> <b>price</b> coefficient on the supply chain performance are elaborately analyzed. These achievements provide decision makers with managerial insights and offer efficient guidelines for the construction machinery remanufacturing firms to solve similar puzzles...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to strict}} {{environmental}} legislations and competitive economics worldwide, closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) management has been receiving increasing attention. In {{order to improve}} the return rate of used products, in this paper, a recovery framework is proposed by employing buy-back offer at retailer level. The proposed recovery framework is integrated with an optimization model for a multi-period CLSC under demand and capacity uncertainty to determine optimal <b>buy-back</b> <b>price</b> {{that needs to be}} offered to consumers so that the minimum collection limit set by the legislators is fulfilled as well as overall cost of the integrated system is minimized. The developed model addresses the possibility of three way recovery options, namely; product remanufacturing, component remanufacturing, and raw material recovery to determine the optimal manufacturing, remanufacturing and recycling quantity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that there is a trade-off between the extra benefit generated through remanufacturing and the cost of acquisition of used products due to the employment of buy-back offer. A condition for the buy-back offer to be simultaneously advantageous for both manufacturer and retailer under revenue sharing contract is derived. A comparative study is also undertaken to examine the performance of the CLSC when collection is made through buy-back offer vs. third-party collection. The proposed CLSC model is further extended by adding a separate demand for remanufactured products and the performance of the initial model with the extended model is compared.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comparative computational {{study of the}} performance of two different pricing mechanisms in a day-ahead wholesale electricity market, where performance is measured as the average level of payments made by the system operator to the generators. It focusses on two key pricing mechanisms: a uniform <b>price</b> based <b>buy-back</b> <b>pricing</b> model, defined as a short run approximation to the market design in Great Britain, and a nodal pricing model based on Locational Marginal Pricing rules. The research uses a game theory based approach for modelling themarket, allowing multiple rounds of the game to be played and statistically reliable results to be obtained. The research develops an agent based simulation of the day ahead markets for both of the pricing mechanisms, and is simulated on a constrained electricity grid. The agents developed for the simulation each represent a generator and are designed to be profit maximising with respect to a parent generation company. Agents employ an evolutionary algorithm in order to create optimised bids for the generation of electricity based on the current market state. Simulations of the market are performed using a styalised 29 -Node transmission grid. A series of experiments are performed comparing the performance of the nodal and <b>buy-back</b> <b>pricing</b> mechanisms, under a series of different operating conditions. It is seen in all of the observed cases that the nodal market design averages a higher level of payments to its participants, and the indication is that the agents in a nodal market are able to explore the higher risk strategies more profitably than their buy-back counterparts. This work also highlights the value of creating evolutionary agents that are robust and flexible in analysing market designs. This research demonstrates that the greater the level of competition in a market the more efficiently market participants act. In addition to this the agents competing with a uniform based Buy Back pricing system appears far more restricted by higher levels of competition than their Nodal counterparts...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} a closed loop supply chain where demands {{can either be}} satis¯ed from manufacturing new products or by buying back used products from cus- tomers and upgrading their functionality by remanufacturing. A joint <b>buy-back</b> <b>pricing</b> and manufacturing-remanufacturing decision model at the operations- marketing interface model is presented that allows for dynamic parameters, e. g., product life cycles and seasonal aspects. The model allows to identify bene¯cial opportunities for buying back and storing used products for imme- diate and future recovery. We present a new deterministic, dynamic, continuous time optimization model, derive necessary and su±cient optimality conditions, and develop a solution algorithm to ¯nd the cost minimizing manufacturing and remanufacturing policies as well as buy back strategies for used prod- ucts based on Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. It is shown that an optimal policy, in general, will include time intervals where returns are acquired as to synchronize demand and remanufacturing, where returns are acquired and stored for future remanufacturing, and intervals where demand is satis¯ed by a mix of manufactured and remanufactured products. Furthermore, we discuss several reactive and proactive acquisition and remanufacturing heuristics and show under which conditions they are optimal. The ¯ndings are illustrated by numerical examples...|$|R
40|$|Consider a one-supplier one-retailer {{supply chain}} facing {{stochastic}} price-dependent de-mand. This paper addresses two problems: (1) how {{to coordinate the}} decentralized supply chain; (2) how to determine the combined pricing and inventory decision. We propose a novel supplier-retailer contract to coordinate the supply chain facing price-dependent demand. In this supply chain, the retailer places a one-time order and the supplier produces and delivers the order to the retailer prior to the selling season. Before the retailer places any order, the supplier announces the contract specifications which specifies the returns policy and wholesale price. The new contract {{is determined by the}} supplier through proper setting of wholesale and <b>buy-back</b> <b>prices.</b> It has certain appealing features: its contract parameters and execu-tions are independent of the stochastic demand distribution, it is symmetric in the sense that both the supplier and retailer’s profits are linearly correlated and it has certain advantages in implementation. With this contract the retailer needs to solve the newsvendor problem with pricing. We identify a class of demand distributions, which can result in well-behaved profit functions and unifies most of the existent results in the literature of newsvendor pricing problems...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} government's reward and penalty {{mechanism}} {{in the presence}} of asymmetric information and carbon emission constraint when downstream retailers compete in a reverse supply chain network. Considering five game models which are different in terms of the coordination structure of the reverse supply chain network and power structure of the reward-penalty mechanism: (1) the reverse supply chain network centralized decision-making model; (2) the reverse supply chain network centralized decision-making model with carbon emission constraint; (3) the retailers' competition reverse supply chain network decentralized decision-making model; (4) the retailers' competition reverse supply chain network decentralized decision-making model with carbon emission constraint; (5) the retailers' competition reverse supply chain network decentralized decision-making model with carbon emission constraint and the government's reward-penalty mechanism. Building the participation-incentive contract under each model use the principal-agent theory, and solving the model use the Lagrange multiplier method. We can get the following conclusion: 1) when the government implements the reward-penalty mechanism for carbon emission and recycling simultaneously, the recycling rate as well as the <b>buy-back</b> <b>price</b> offered by the manufacturer are higher than those when the government conducts reward-penalty mechanism exclusively for carbon emission; 2) when the government implements carbon emission constraint, both retailers' selling prices of the new product are higher than those when no carbon emission constraint is forced; 3) there is no certain relationship between the two retailers' selling prices of the new product when the government implements the reward-penalty mechanism only for carbon emission and when it implements the mechanism for carbon emission as well as recycling...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a risk-neutral {{manufacturer}} sells {{a single}} product to a risk-neutral retailer. The retailer chooses inventories ex ante and promotional effort ex post. If the wholesale price exceeds marginal production cost, the retailer orders {{fewer than the}} joint profit-maximizing inventories. If the manufacturer attempts to coordinate inventories by buying back unsold units, then the retailer's promotional incentives are dulled. Under very general assumptions on {{the form of the}} effort function, we show that buy-backs adversely affect supply chain profits, and higher <b>buy-back</b> <b>prices</b> imply lower profits. Also, while a buy-back alone cannot coordinate the channel, coupling buy-backs with promotional cost-sharing agreements (if effort cost is observable), offering unilateral markdown allowances ex post (if demand is observable but not verifiable), or placing additional constraints on the buy-back (if demand is observable and verifiable) does result in coordination. This problem is not limited to returns policies but is shown to hold for a much larger set of contracts. The results are quite robust (e. g., when the retailer chooses effort before observing demand), but coordinating contracts become more problematic if, for example, the retailer also stocks substitutes for the manufacturer's product. Other model extensions are also discussed. supply chain management, sales effort, promotional effort, supply contracts, incentives, channel coordination, inventory management, buyback, returns policies, cost sharing, markdown allowance...|$|R
40|$|When {{suppliers}} produce {{products for}} which demand is uncertain, {{they face a}} problem of inducing downstream distributors to stock inventory levels that the suppliers prefer. This paper considers {{a wide array of}} alternative supply contracts, each of which consists of a mixture of constant per-unit wholesale <b>prices,</b> <b>buy-back</b> arrangements, and post sale payments contingent on sales made, such as revenue sharing or buybacks. We show that linear supply contracts specifying any combination of two of these three instruments can implement the vertical integrated outcome for a monopoly, thereby generating the supplier's preferred inventory configuration and price distribution. We extend our results to differentiated product oligopoly, demonstrating that each supplier obtains its preferred inventory configuration and price distribution, given the choices of its rival. Distributors choose optimal inventories from the suppliers' standpoint, even if suppliers do not know the distribution of demand uncertainty, and, given the perfect competition among distributors, all profits in the supply chain are captured by suppliers. Thus, suppliers are able to deal with demand uncertainty with remarkably little information about demand, and without the need to control dealer actions in detail. In particular, suppliers need not specify either dealer inventories or resale prices, but instead encourage distributors to order based on information in their possession and to set prices that generate desirable resale price dispersion.
