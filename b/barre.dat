5|$|After {{the death}} of King Henry, <b>Barre</b> joined the service of William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, who was justiciar and Lord Chancellor. Longchamp named <b>Barre</b> as Archdeacon of Ely, with the {{appointment}} occurring before 4 July 1190. Longchamp sent <b>Barre</b> as a royal justice to the counties near Ely in 1190. However, Longchamp was driven into exile in late 1191 owing to the hostility of the English nobility and Richard's brother Prince John during Richard's absence on the Third Crusade. Longchamp's exile meant that <b>Barre</b> did not serve as a royal justice again until King Richard I returned to England in 1194. Although Longchamp eventually returned to England, he {{did not return to}} his diocese, and much of the administration of Ely would have devolved on <b>Barre</b> during Longchamp's absence.|$|E
5|$|Richard <b>Barre</b> (c. 1130– c. 1202) was {{a medieval}} English justice, clergyman and scholar. He was educated {{at the law}} school of Bologna and entered royal service under King Henry II of England, later working for Henry's son and {{successor}} Richard I. He was also briefly in the household of Henry's son Henry the Young King. <b>Barre</b> served the elder Henry as a diplomat and {{was involved in a}} minor way with the king's quarrel with Thomas Becket, which earned <b>Barre</b> a condemnation from Becket. After King Henry's death, <b>Barre</b> became a royal justice during Richard's reign {{and was one of the}} main judges in the period from 1194 to 1199. After disagreeing with him earlier in his career, <b>Barre</b> was discharged from his judgeship during John's reign as king. <b>Barre</b> was also archdeacon of Ely and the author of a work of biblical extracts dedicated to one of his patrons, William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely and Chancellor of England.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barre</b> {{was one of}} {{the main}} royal justices between 1194 and 1199. He also served as a lawyer for the new Bishop of Ely, Eustace, who was elected in August 1197. But <b>Barre</b> had {{incurred}} the hostility of the king's younger brother Prince John, and when John succeeded Richard as king in 1199, <b>Barre</b> ceased to be employed as a royal justice, instead returning to Ely and business in his clerical office. His last sure mention in the historical record is on 9 August 1202, when he was serving as a judge-delegate for Pope Innocent III, but he may have been alive as late as 1213, as he was part of a papal panel deciding a case that can only be securely dated to between 1198 and 1213. <b>Barre</b> maintained his friendship with Stephen of Tournai, who corresponded with him later in their lives.|$|E

5|$|Rivoli {{departed}} Venice on 21 February 1812 {{under the}} command of Commodore Jean-Baptiste <b>Barré,</b> accompanied by five smaller escort ships, the 16-gun brigs Mercure and Iéna, the 8-gun brig Mamelouck and two small gunboats, strung out in an improvised line of battle. <b>Barré</b> hoped to make use of a heavy sea fog that had descended, to break out from Venice and elude pursuit. Victorious had held off from the land during the fog and by the time Talbot was able to observe Venice harbour at 14:30, his opponent had escaped. Searching for <b>Barré,</b> who was sailing to Pula, Talbot spotted one of the French brigs at 15:00 and gave chase.|$|E
5|$|After Becket's {{murder in}} December 1170 King Henry sent <b>Barre</b> to Rome, {{accompanied}} by the Archbishop of Rouen, the bishops of Évreux and Worcester, and other royal clerks, to plead the royal case with the papacy. The mission's objective was {{to make it clear}} to Alexander that Henry had {{had nothing to do with}} Becket's murder and that the king was horrified that it had taken place. <b>Barre</b> was at first refused a meeting with Alexander, but eventually the envoys were allowed to meet with the pope. Although the mission was not a complete success, the royal commission did manage to persuade the papacy not to impose an interdict, or ban on clerical rites, on England or to excommunicate the king. Shortly afterwards <b>Barre</b> was granted the office of Archdeacon of Lisieux, probably as a reward for his efforts in Rome in 1171. In September he was named a royal justice. He was named chancellor to King Henry's eldest living son Henry for a brief period in 1172 and 1173, but when the younger Henry rebelled against his father and sought refuge at the French royal court, <b>Barre</b> refused to join him in exile and returned to the king's service. <b>Barre</b> took with him the younger Henry's seal.|$|E
5|$|At 08:45 Rivoli, {{which had}} been {{struggling}} to reach the harbour of Trieste, lost her mizzenmast under fire from both Victorious and Weasel. Nearly at the same moment, two of her 36-pounder long guns exploded, killing or wounding 60 men, greatly disorganising and demoralising the others, and forcing <b>Barré</b> to transfer gunners from the upper gun deck to man his lower battery. Fifteen minutes later, with his ship unmanageable and battered, Commodore <b>Barré</b> surrendered. Rivoli had suffered over 400 killed and wounded from her crew of over 800, who had only assembled {{for the first time}} a few days before and had never sailed their ship in open water. Losses aboard Victorious were also heavy, with one officer and 25 sailors and marines killed and six officers (including Captain Talbot) and 93 men wounded.|$|E

5|$|In Africa, Somali army {{officers}} led by Siad <b>Barre</b> {{carried out a}} bloodless coup in 1969, creating the socialist Somali Democratic Republic. The Soviet Union vowed to support Somalia. Four years later, the pro-American Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown in a 1974 coup by the Derg, a radical group of Ethiopian {{army officers}} led by the pro-Soviet Mengistu Haile Mariam, who built up relations with the Cubans and the Soviets. When fighting between the Somalis and Ethiopians {{broke out in the}} 1977–1978 Somali-Ethiopian Ogaden War, <b>Barre</b> lost his Soviet support and turned to the Safari Club—a group of pro-American intelligence agencies including Iran, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia—for support and weapons. The Ethiopian military was supported by Cuban soldiers along with Soviet military advisors and armaments.|$|E

5|$|The {{treatise}} Tractatus of Glanvill, {{which is}} traditionally attributed to Osbert's uncle Ranulf de Glanvill, {{and to which}} Osbert himself may have contributed, names only seven judges, including Osbert. He {{was one of a}} group of royal justices that included Simon of Pattishall, Ralph Foliot, Richard <b>Barre,</b> William de Warenne, and Richard Herriard, used by Hubert Walter, the Justiciar of England during Richard's reign, and chosen for their ability rather than any familial ties. This group replaced the previous system of using mostly local men, and represent the first signs of a professional judiciary. In 1194 Osbert was one of the collectors of the carucage in eastern England, along with <b>Barre</b> and de Warrene.|$|E
5|$|Warenne {{was one of}} a {{group of}} justices– {{including}} Richard <b>Barre,</b> Ralph Foliot, Richard Herriard, and William of Sainte-Mère-Église– who were appointed in 1194 by the Lord Chancellor Hubert Walter as justices for a new general eyre, to relieve the Barons of the Exchequer of some of their judicial duties. In 1195 Warenne served as a royal justice at Oxford with Hubert Walter, William Brewer and Geoffrey of Buckland. Warenne served again as a justice in 1198–1199 and then again during the first two years of the reign of John. His last service as a justice was in 1200. In 1200 John removed Warenne as a royal justice and appointed him as one of the four Justices for the Jews, replacing Simon of Pattishall. These officials had been created in 1194 and were not concerned with judicial matters concerning Jews, but rather with the collection of debts owed to Jews by Christians. Warenne continued in that office until 1209. Besides judicial duties, Warenne also served in other capacities, working with <b>Barre</b> and Osbert fitzHervey to collect the carucage in 1194 in eastern England. In 1199 he again served with <b>Barre</b> and fitzHervey to impose amercements in the counties of Cambridge, Northamptonshire, Huntingdonshire, Norfolk and Suffolk.|$|E

However, several officials managed to escape abroad and started to form the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1926, the American Association of State Highway Officials {{formally}} {{established the}} U.S. Highway System {{and many of the}} New England inter-state routes were redesignated as U.S. Routes. The portion of New England Route 14 from <b>Barre</b> to Burlington was assigned to U.S. Route 2, while the portion in New Hampshire was assigned to U.S. Route 4. This shortened Route 14 in the south to US 4/US 5 in White River Junction, and in the north to US 2 in the city of <b>Barre.</b> In 1935, the portion of US 2 between Montpelier and St. Johnsbury was relocated to a more northerly alignment using a section of then Vermont Route 18. The old US 2 alignment was redesignated as US 302. VT 14 was extended northward several miles to East Montpelier, ending at the junction of newly relocated US 2 and Vermont Route 12.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, more {{resistance}} movements {{supported by}} Ethiopia's communist Derg administration had sprung {{up across the}} country. <b>Barre</b> responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerillas, especially in the northern regions.

5|$|During January and February 1170 {{the king}} sent <b>Barre</b> on a {{diplomatic}} {{mission to the}} pope in Rome, on a matter related to the king's dispute with Becket. The mission attempted to secure the rescinding of the excommunication of those whom Becket had placed under clerical ban, but it was unsuccessful; rumours circulated that the mission sought and secured papal permission for the coronation of King Henry's eldest living son by someone other than Becket. When Becket protested to Pope Alexander III over this usurpation {{of the right of}} the archbishop to crown English kings, Alexander not only stated that no such permission had been granted but threatened to suspend or depose any bishop who crowned Henry's heir. Barlow thinks it possible that <b>Barre</b> received a verbal agreement from the pope in January to allow the coronation, but there is no written evidence that Alexander agreed to allow the coronation in 1170.|$|E
40|$|We {{prepared}} dense flat-sheet Ag-functionalized carbon molecular-sieve (CMS) membranes from blends of P 84 co-polyimide and a sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) with a Ag+ counterion (AgSPEEK).
