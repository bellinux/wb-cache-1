The young man made to go on, but Guerrino persuaded him to stay. At the time, the lands were attacked by a wild horse and a wild mare that ruined crops and killed beasts, men, and women. The two servants told the king that Guerrino had boasted that he could kill these horses. The king summoned him and promised to reward him if he did it; when Guerrino hesitated, he threatened to execute him if he did not. The young man {{told him to get}} a <b>blacksmith's</b> <b>services</b> from the king, and then have the blacksmith make enormous horseshoes for the young man's horse. Then he had Guerrino ride the horse until he met the horse, at which point he should dismount, free the horse, and climb a tree. Guerrino did this, the horses fought, and the wild one was defeated.

50|$|New Edinburg {{has never}} had a {{population}} more than 200. At its height, the center of the town included six general stores, a cafe, a hotel, a blacksmith, and an automotive service garage. The hotel was built c. 1898, and served as such until 1910, when it was converted to a residence. The blacksmithy is a utilitarian wood frame building with a metal roof, built c. 1936, which was used by two <b>blacksmiths.</b> The <b>service</b> station was built of similar materials in 1940, and (as of 2001) housed the local volunteer fire department. The cafe building dates to about 1928, but does not contribute to the district because of significant modifications to its facade in 2000.|$|R

50|$|Waterloo Village is a {{restored}} 19th-century canal town in Byram Township, Sussex County (west of Stanhope) in northwestern New Jersey, United States.

Waterloo possessed all the accommodations necessary to service {{the needs of a}} canal operation, including an inn, a general store, a church, a <b>blacksmith</b> shop (to <b>service</b> the mules on the canal), and a watermill. For canal workers, Waterloo's geographic location would have been conducive to being an overnight stopover point on the two-day trip between Phillipsburg and Jersey City.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, an {{alternative}} legend about its manufacture {{is that it}} was built by a local blacksmith for the siege of Threave Castle in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. According to this tale, which was lent credence by Sir Walter Scott, when King James arrived at Threave to besiege the Earl of Douglas, the Clan MacLellan presented him with this bombard. The first shot fired is said to have passed clean through the castle, severing the hand of Margaret, Countess of Douglas on the way. The gun was subsequently named after [...] "Mollance", the lands gifted to the <b>blacksmith</b> for his <b>service,</b> and [...] "Meg", the name of his wife. Later historians have not taken this legend particularly seriously, not least because of the improbability that such a weapon could be forged by a village smith.|$|R
