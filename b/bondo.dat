25|$|Due to its {{location}} in a steep-sided valley, the Italian town of Viganella gets no direct sunlight for seven weeks each winter. In 2006 a €100,000 computer-controlled mirror, 8×5m, was installed to reflect sunlight {{into the town}}'s piazza. In early 2007 the similarly situated village of <b>Bondo,</b> Switzerland, was considering applying this solution as well. In 2013, mirrors were installed to reflect sunlight into the town square in the Norwegian town of Rjukan.

25|$|A {{separate}} Norwegian {{mission was}} created {{at the annual}} conferences in 1915. Fund-raising secured that Bernhard Ålbu was able to travel to Belgian Congo. This {{was the first time}} that Norwegian Baptist missionaries traveled without being under the auspices of the ABMU. Due to the First World War he was not able to travel until 1918. The effort was concentrated in the Bas-Uele District, especially in the settlements of Bili and Monga. The network was gradually expanded and by the 1970s there were additional missionary stations in <b>Bondo,</b> Butu, Likati and Ndu. By 1945 the Congo mission had baptized 3,000 converts.|$|E
25|$|The {{unpainted}} stainless body creates challenges during {{restoration of}} the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original ("straight") as possible and imperfections are sculpted back to form with body filler like <b>Bondo</b> or lead (body solder). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the quarter panel). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain—which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to work-harden. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired; each DeLorean service center today {{has at least one}} experienced body repair person on staff, and there are decades worth of new stainless panels still available in most instances.|$|E
500|$|Fantala was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to threaten the Farquhar Group since Cyclone <b>Bondo</b> in 2006. Most of the 34residents on Farquhar Atoll evacuated ahead of the storm, and those that remained behind were uninjured. While moving through the Seychelles near peak intensity, Fantala had estimated 10-minute sustained winds of 250km/h (155mph), and days later it moved through the region again with 10-minute sustained winds estimated at 130km/h (80mph). Based on satellite imagery, {{it was estimated that}} of the 50structures on Farquhar Atoll, 19 were destroyed and 27 sustained severe damage. Only four buildings, which were constructed to be cyclone-proof after <b>Bondo,</b> withstood the estimated 350km/h (220mph) gusts, even then suffering moderate damage. In addition, many of the island's trees were knocked down. Due to the storm's prolonged passage through the island group, the Seychelles government declared the Farquhar islands as a disaster area on 20 April. In a visit to the Seychelles, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that the country has become [...] "highly vulnerable to storm surges, as we are reminded by the recent devastating effects of Cyclone Fantala." [...] A World Bank survey team found $4.5 million in damage. The lodge on the island was not expected to be rebuilt until March 2017, about 11 months after the storm. In April 2017, the development of two new islands in the lagoon of Farquhar's lagoon was attributed to the cyclone.|$|E
