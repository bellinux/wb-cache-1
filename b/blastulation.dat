As of 2014, time-lapse microscopy for embryo quality assessment is emerging from the experimental stage to something with enough evidence for broader clinical use. Studies using the EmbryoScope(tm) time-lapse incubator have used several indicators for embryo quality, such as direct cleavage from 1 to 3 cells, {{as well as the}} initiation of compaction and start of <b>blastulation.</b> Also, two-pronuclear zygotes (2PN) transitioning through 1PN or 3PN states tend to develop into poorer-quality embryos than those that constantly remain 2PN.|$|E
50|$|After fertilization, the {{conceptus}} travels {{down the}} oviduct towards the uterus {{while continuing to}} divide mitotically without actually increasing in size, in a process called cleavage. After four divisions, the conceptus consists of 16 blastomeres, and it {{is known as the}} morula. Through the processes of compaction, cell division, and <b>blastulation,</b> the conceptus takes the form of the blastocyst by the fifth day of development, just as it approaches the site of implantation. When the blastocyst hatches from the zona pellucida, it can implant in the endometrial lining of the uterus and begin the embryonic stage of development.|$|E
50|$|Cleavage {{itself is}} the first stage in <b>blastulation,</b> the process of forming the blastocyst. Cells {{differentiate}} into an outer layer of cells (collectively called the trophoblast) and an inner cell mass. With further compaction the individual outer blastomeres, the trophoblasts, become indistinguishable. They are still enclosed within the zona pellucida. This compaction serves to make the structure watertight, containing the fluid that the cells will later secrete. The inner mass of cells differentiate to become embryoblasts and polarise at one end. They close together and form gap junctions, which facilitate cellular communication. This polarisation leaves a cavity, the blastocoel, creating a structure that is now termed the blastocyst. (In animals other than mammals, {{this is called the}} blastula.) The trophoblasts secrete fluid into the blastocoel. The resulting increase in size of the blastocyst causes it to hatch through the zone pellucida, which then disintegrates.|$|E

After early {{research on the}} development and histogenesis of muscles, professor Godlewski's scientific interests focused on regeneration and mechanisms regulating the process of fertilization, as well as early embryo development, <b>blastulation</b> and gastrulation. He was also interested in {{the origin of the}} primary differentiating cells in regenerates. He postulated the importance of epithelial tissue in this process and was the first to point out the change in the function, organization and role of the cells under the influence of external stimuli. Investigating fertilization and early development, he focused on the cooperation between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the regulation of the early stages of development. Godlewski was {{also the author of the}} theory of migration of the inherited substances from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and, after their processing, from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. His works were never fragmentary, but always synthetic attempts at explaining important issues relating to the mechanisms of development. In 1936 Professor Godlewski was awarded the title of Member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. Apart from doing research and teaching, Emil Godlewski devoted a lot of time to social issues, especially those connected to medicine.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{determine}} whether sequential or monophasic media {{is the more}} optimal formulation for blastocyst development and sustained implantation rates (SIR) in IVF. DesignPaired randomized controlled trials. SettingAcademic. Patient(s) Infertile couples (N = 192) with female partner ≤ 42  years old and normal ovarian reserve. Intervention(s) Fertilized zygotes from each patient were randomly divided into two groups: [1] cultured in sequential media and [2] cultured in monophasic medium. Sequential media consisted of Quinn's Advantage Cleavage Medium (SAGE) followed by Blast Assist (Origio). The monophasic medium used was Continuous Single Culture (Irvine Scientific). Paired ETs were accomplished by transferring the best euploid blastocyst from each media group. DNA fingerprinting was used to link outcomes. Main Outcome Measure(s) The primary outcome measure was the proportion of blastocysts suitable for clinical use. Secondary outcome measures included timing of <b>blastulation,</b> aneuploidy rates, and SIR. Sustained implantation rate {{is defined as the}} number fetal heart beats at 8 – 9  weeks of gestation, divided by the number of embryos transferred. Result(s) A total of 192 patients had their 2 PN embryos (N = 2, 257) randomized to each culture system. Sequential media had higher <b>blastulation</b> rate than monophasic medium (55. 2 % vs. 46. 9 %). No differences were found in the day of <b>blastulation</b> or aneuploidy rate. Of the 168 patients who had euploid blastocysts suitable for transfer, 126 completed a paired ET. Among the double ETs, {{there was no difference in}} implantation between groups. Conclusion(s) This is the first randomized controlled trial to examine paired euploid transfers of sibling zygotes cultured in sequential versus monophasic media. This study demonstrates that the usable blastocyst rate is greatest after culture in the sequential media tested in comparison with the monophasic formulation selected for study. However, no difference exists in timing of <b>blastulation,</b> aneuploidy, or SIR. Whether these observations are generalizable to other media systems remains to be determined.

40|$|MicroRNAs {{are small}} {{regulatory}} RNAs that bind to the seeding regions within the 3 ’-untranslated region (3 ’-UTR) of their target transcripts to modulate transcript stability and/or inhibit protein translation. MicroRNA Let- 7 a {{belonging to the}} Lethal- 7 (Let- 7) family is down-regulated at the blastocyst stage, suggesting its suppression is crucial for embryo implantation. Yet, the underlying mechanism on how Let- 7 a modulates blastocyst implantation remains largely unknown. In silico analysis identified attachment related integrin beta- 3, outgrowth related vav 3, and the microRNA processing dicer, as Let- 7 a targets. Therefore, it is hypothesized that down-regulation of Let- 7 a promotes embryo implantation by stimulating these target proteins. Let- 7 a is down-regulated during <b>blastulation</b> and at 3 -hour post-estradiol activation of the dormant blastocysts. Force-expression of Let- 7 a in mouse blastocysts suppressed blastocyst attachment, outgrowth on fibronectin-coated plates and compromised pregnancy in vivo. Dual luciferase assay using the 3 ’-UTR reporter constructs of the integrin beta- 3, vav 3, and dicer confirmed the interaction between Let- 7 a and the three targets. Force-expressing or inhibiting Let- 7 a expression in mouse blastocysts by electroporating the Let- 7 a precursor or inhibitor respectively illustrated post-transcriptional regulation of Let- 7 a on integrin beta- 3 and vav 3, and transcriptional regulation on dicer. Dormant blastocysts retrieved from the delayed implanting mice expressed high Let- 7 a levels, which was suppressed in the first 12 -hours of estradiol activation. Concomitantly, dormant blastocysts expressed low levels of integrin beta- 3, vav 3, and dicer, yet, their protein expression was up-regulated from 3 hours-post estradiol activation. Furthermore, addition of integrin beta- 3 antibody suppressed attachment of trophoblast spheroids (blastocyst surrogate) onto endometrial epithelial cells in a co-culture model and the outgrowth of the spheroids on fibronectin-coated plates. Knockdown of Vav 3 with siRNA decreased <b>blastulation,</b> hatching, and outgrowth rates of the embryos in vitro. Although the loss of vav 3 activities did not affect embryo implantation, it suppressed trophoblast migration on fibronectin-coated plates and invasion into collagen matrix. In contrast, force-expression of vav 3 enhanced blastocyst outgrowth, and promoted cell proliferation. Blocking integrin beta- 3 activities in the vav 3 knock-down embryos further suppressed blastocyst outgrowth, suggesting the intertwining effect of the integrins and vav 3. Dicer knock-down in mouse blastocysts decreased mature Let- 7 a expression and suppressed <b>blastulation</b> and hatching in vitro and implantation in vivo. Dicer knock-down in estradiol activated mouse blastocysts decreased the epidermal growth factor receptor expression and lowered the affinity of the embryos to EGF, and suppressed the implantation potential to a level {{similar to that of}} dormant blastocysts. Taken together, the suppression of Let- 7 a by estradiol up-regulates integrin beta- 3, vav 3, and dicer. The increased Itgb 3 expression promotes blastocyst attachment and intertwined with the up-regulated vav 3 expression to enhance blastocyst outgrowth. The increased vav 3 expression further stimulates cell proliferation and confers blastocyst invasion into the collagen matrix. Dicer, by altering microRNA processing, facilitates <b>blastulation</b> and thereby embryo implantation. Thus, the loss of Let- 7 a biological activities during <b>blastulation</b> is crucial to enhance <b>blastulation</b> and stimulate trophoblast activities for successful embryo implantation. published_or_final_versionObstetrics and GynaecologyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} PLM as a reproducible {{non-invasive method}} {{in the assessment}} of sperm head retardance, and observing PLM within a clinical setting to select an optimal sperm for ICSI.

A range and frequency of head retardance was developed from pooled samples and then analysed further comparing normal and abnormal head morphology. 3. 	Normal sperm selected for ICSI according to the W. H. O 5 th edition, were imaged prior to injection. Images were analysed later-blinded to the ICSI outcome. Single embryo culture and elective single blastocyst transfer (eSET) were undertaken. PLM retardance was compared with embryo fertilisation, cleavage, <b>blastulation,</b> utilisation and clinical pregnancy rates using independent sample T tests, Pearson's correlation coefficients, ROC curves and X 2 tests. Results: 1. 	The intra/inter-observer variation revealed our method to be reproducible by an Intra-class correlation coefficient and Pearson's co-efficient P 0. 05) in sperm retardance when comparing normally fertilised oocytes against either abnormal/nil fertilisation. Good quality embryos had lower retardance (P 0. 05) in retardance when comparing <b>blastulation</b> and failed <b>blastulation,</b> however utilised embryos had lower retardance compared to discarded embryos (P< 0. 05).

Over the last decade, efforts in improving non-invasive embryo assessment have {{looked into the}} secretome of embryos. Human embryos release genomic DNA (gDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the culture medium, and the mtDNA/gDNA ratio is significantly correlated with embryo fragmentation. Here, we investigate whether mtDNA/gDNA ratio in embryo spent medium is correlated with <b>blastulation</b> potential and implantation. The mtDNA/gDNA ratio was assessed in 699 Day 3 culture media by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to investigate its correlation with embryo morphology, blastocyst development and implantation. A logistic regression model evaluated whether mtDNA/gDNA ratio in the secretome may improve the prediction of <b>blastulation.</b> We found that embryos that successfully developed into blastocysts exhibited a significantly higher mtDNA/gDNA ratio in the culture medium compared with those that arrest (P = 0. 0251), and mtDNA/gDNA, combined with morphological grading, {{has the potential to}} predict <b>blastulation</b> better than morphology alone (P = 0. 02). Moreover, mtDNA/gDNA ratio was higher in the media from good-quality embryos that reached the full blastocyst stage on Day 5 compared with those that developed more slowly (P < 0. 0001). With respect to blastocyst morphology, higher trophectoderm quality was associated with a higher mtDNA/gDNA ratio in the culture medium. Finally, a high mtDNA/gDNA ratio in spent medium was associated with successful implantation outcome (P = 0. 0452) of good-quality embryos. In summary, the mtDNA/gDNA ratio in the Day 3 embryo secretome, in combination with morphological grading, may be a novel, non-invasive, early biomarker to improve identification of viable embryos with high developmental potential...|$|E

Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of embryos derived from intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. Two hundred thirty-five consecutive ICSI cycles {{were included in the}} study; all treatment was provided at the Cleveland Clinic Fertility Center. Patient cycles were divided by sperm morphology based on Kruger's strict criteria: Group A, embryos where teratozoospermic sperm (0 - 2 % normal) were used for ICSI and Group B, embryos where dysmorphic sperm (5 - 13 % normal) were used for ICSI. All cycles analyzed were of patients doing day 3 embryo transfers. Outcome measures assessed included pronuclear (PN) pattern, syngamy, early cleavage, cell number, rate of compaction and <b>blastulation</b> of embryos left in culture and not transferred on day 3. Results A total of 1762 embryos were analyzed. PN patterns were similar in Group A and Group B embryos. No differences were noted in syngamy, cleavage, cell number or <b>blastulation</b> rate. Studying the development of embryos in culture after day 3 transfer revealed a difference in the timeline for compaction. By day 4, 25 % of Group A embryos had compacted compared to 36 % in Group B (P = 0. 0007). There was no difference found between Group A and Group B embryos in regards to <b>blastulation.</b> Conclusions We did not find an association between sperm morphology and clinical outcomes.

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} work was to assess the influence of male factors (sperm quality and paternal age) on the outcomes of conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Methods This retrospective study included all couples who underwent IVF or ICSI at Montpellier University Hospital, France, between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2015.

In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the embryotrophic ac-tions of GM-CSF. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry, expression of mRNA and protein of the GM-CSF-receptor alpha subunit (GM-Ra) was de-tected in embryos from the first-cleavage through blastocyst stages of development, but the GM-CSF-receptor beta common subunit (bc) could not be detected at any stage. When neutral-izing antibodies reactive with GM-Ra were added to embryo culture experiments, the development-promoting effect of GM-CSF was ablated. In contrast, GM-CSF activity in embryos was not inhibited either by antibodies to bc or by E 21 R, a synthetic GM-CSF analogue that acts to antagonize bc-mediated GM-CSF signaling.

40|$|Introduction: The {{physiological}} {{signals that}} direct the division and differentiation of the zygote {{to form a}} blastocyst, and subsequent embryonic stem cell division and differentiation during early embryogenesis, are unknown. Although a number of growth factors, including the pregnancy-associated hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) are secreted by trophoblasts that lie adjacent to the embryoblast in the blastocyst, {{it is not known}} whether these growth factors directly signal human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Methods: Here we used hESCs as a model of inner cell mass differentiation to examine the hormonal requirements for the formation of embryoid bodies (EB’s; akin to <b>blastulation)</b> and neuroectodermal rosettes (akin to neurulation). Results: We found that hCG promotes the division of hESCs and their differentiation into EB’s and neuroectodermal rosettes. Inhibition of luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) signaling suppresses hESC proliferation, an effect that is reversed by treatment with hCG. hCG treatment rapidly upregulates steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) -mediated cholesterol transport and the synthesis of progesterone (P 4). hESCs express P 4 receptor A, and treatment of hESC colonies with P 4 induces neurulation, as demonstrated by the expression of nestin and the formation of columnar neuroectodermal cells that organize into neural tubelike rosettes. Suppression of P 4 signaling by withdrawing P 4 or treating with the P 4 -receptor antagonist RU- 486 inhibits the differentiation of hESC colonies into EB’s and rosettes. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that hCG signaling via LHCGR on hESC promotes proliferation and differentiation during <b>blastulation</b> and neurulation.

We therefore retrospectively tested a published blastocyst prediction model on a large combined set of transferred embryos with known clinical outcome. The model was somewhat effective in that we found a relative increase of 30 % for implantation in the model-selected group of embryos. There was, however, a concomitant large rejection of embryos from our test cohort, which actually resulted in pregnancy. This hypothetical experiment highlights the limitations of predicting <b>blastulation</b> only. Crucially, it illustrates that both sensitivity and specificity are important parameters when developing embryo selection models for prospective clinical use...|$|E
40|$|Chromosomal DNA was {{isolated}} from rapidly dividing cells of Xenopus laevis embryos at <b>blastulation,</b> at gastrulation, {{and at the}} beginning of hatching. Few, if any, replication forks were seen by electron microscopy in DNA isolated at any stage of embryogenesis. Instead, unbranched DNA, which appeared to be single-stranded, was abundant at all stages. The percentage of chromosomal DNA that was single-stranded was quantitated by electron microscopy and by monitoring the release of acid-soluble radioactivity during digestion of labeled chromosomal DNA with nucleases specific for single-stranded DNA. The amount of single-stranded DNA was inversely correlated with the length of S phase during embryogenesis. We postulate that chromosomal DNA replication in X. laevis embryos takes place by a mechanism in which strand separation is uncoupled from DNA synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Division of {{the human}} zygote leads to the {{formation}} of the blastocyst that contains human embryonic stem cells (hESC) which develop into the embryo. Little is known about the physiological signals that direct hESC division and differentiation during early embryogenesis. A number of growth factors, including the pregnancy-associated hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), are secreted by trophoblasts^ 1 - 3 ^ that lie adjacent to the embryoblast in the blastocyst, but it is not known whether these growth factors directly signal the epiblast. Here we show that hCG promotes the division of embryoblast-derived inner mass cells (hESC), and their differentiation during <b>blastulation</b> and neurulation. Inhibition of LH/hCG receptor (LHCGR) signaling with P-antisense oligonucleotides suppresses hESC proliferation. Similarly, hESC proliferation can be blocked using an antibody against the extracellular activation site of LHCGR, an effect that is reversed by treatment with hCG. hCG treatment rapidly upregulates steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-mediated cholesterol transport and the synthesis of progesterone, a neurogenic steroid^ 4, 5 ^. Treatment of hESC colonies with progesterone induces neurulation as demonstrated by the expression of nestin and the formation of columnar neuroectodermal cells that organize into neural tube-like rosettes. Suppression of progesterone signaling by withdrawing progesterone or treating with the progesterone receptor antagonist RU- 486 inhibits the differentiation of hESC colonies into embryoid bodies (<b>blastulation)</b> and rosettes (neurulation). These results explain the default pathway of hESC differentiation towards a neural stem cell fate in vitro. Collectively, our findings implicate trophoblastic hCG secretion and signaling via LHCGR on the adjacent embryoblast in the induction of hESC proliferation and differentiation into blastocysts and neurula. This paracrine/juxtacrine signaling by extraembryonic tissues is the commencement of trophic support by placental tissues in the growth and development {{of the human}} embryo...|$|E
40|$|The {{embryonic}} {{development in}} Clarias gariepinus was studied under laboratory conditions. The development stages of eggs starting from first cleavage to hatching were examined microscopically. The accurate timing and {{detailed description of}} each stage were recorded. Photomicrograph of important stages, segmentation, <b>blastulation,</b> differentiation of embryo and hatching, was taken. The result shows that the blastodisc (polar cap) appeared 35 ± 1 minutes after fertilization. The first cleavage dividing the blastodisc into two bl astomeres occurred 15 ± 0. 5 minutes after the polar cap formation. The larva emerged from the egg case 22 hours after fertilization at a water temperature O of 25. 1 ± 1. 5 C. This result will assist in better management of C. gariepinus, enhance their survival to fry and increase the supply of fingerlings in Nigeria...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that human embryos may from {{anomalies}} both in vitro and in vivo. Progress through the preimplanta-tion stages can be marked by multiple nuclei in some or all blastomeres, the formation of numerous fragments of vary-ing size and organized in different patterns, and by arrests in development at virtually any stage. Various parameters have been offered as markers of the success of embryo growth and its culmination in implanta-tion. Some of these involve characteristics in the follicles such as size, steroid output, properties of cumulus cells and others. Most involve studies on embryos in vitro, analysing timing of cleavage, blastomere structure, chromosome complement and timing of <b>blastulation.</b> More recently, characteristics {{in the structure of the}} pronuclei or of the ooplasm have been introduced. Certain dysmorphisms i...|$|E
40|$|Employing cytochemical methods it {{was found}} that during the early {{embryonic}} development of Drosophila melanogaster the nuclei contain in sequence two kinds of chromosomal proteins. The cleavage nuclei (as also the pronuclei), until shortly before the blastoderm stage, contain an atypical (or juvenile) histone, stainable with bromophenol blue but not with alkaline fast green. The typical fast green-positive histone appears {{at the close of the}} period of the synchronized cleavage mitoses, just before <b>blastulation,</b> when nucleoli are first produced. The amount of DNA of the cleavage nuclei, as determined cytophotometrically, is nearly constant; therefore, the DNA moiety of the nucleohistone complex seems to remain unaffected by the protein shift during embryonic development. The implications of the protein shift in relation to the histone control of gene expression are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{embryonic}} {{development in}} Clarias gariepinus was studied under laboratory conditions. The developmental stages of eggs starting from first cleavage were examined microscopically. Photomicroscope {{was used to}} take important stages of segmentation, <b>blastulation,</b> differentiation of embryo and hatching. The films of the photograph were developed and printed for each stage produced. The accurate timing and detailed description of each stage was done. The {{results show that the}} blastodisc (Polar cap) appeared about 35 minutes after fertilization and the first cleavage dividing the blastodisc into two blastomeres occurs 15 minutes after polar cap formation. Details of the developmental stages of embryos and the timing from one stage to the other were described. The larva shook off the shell and emerged completely from the egg case about 22 hours after fertilization at a water temperature of 25. 1 degree C. The accurate determination of the time of initiation of first mitosis is of great importance in fish culture and breeding especially in the production of tetraploid...|$|E
