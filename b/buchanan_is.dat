25|$|The {{attempt was}} now {{scheduled}} for 4.00 am on Tuesday 7 May and by two hours past daylight the English were defeated. Although {{there were two}} breaches, {{the damage to the}} walls was insufficient. None of the flanking batteries were disabled, and the scaling ladders were too short. The result was heavy losses estimated at 1000 to 1500 Scots and English. A report by Peter Carew estimated a third of the dead were Scottish. However, Carew's total of six-score dead, which was followed by George <b>Buchanan,</b> <b>is</b> roughly a tenth of the other reports. The accountant and victualler of Berwick, Sir Valentine Browne noted there were 1,688 men unable to serve, still on the payroll, hurt at the assault or at various other times, and now sick or dead. The author of the Diurnal of Occurents put the total number slain at 400. Humfrey Barwick was told the French collected the top-coats of the English who had reached and died on the walls, and 448 were counted. The French journal claims only 15 defenders were killed. John Knox and the French journal attributed some of the casualties to the women of Leith throwing stones from the ramparts.|$|E

500|$|Soulé was {{a former}} U.S. Senator from Louisiana {{and member of the}} Young America movement, who sought a {{realization}} of American influence in the Caribbean and Central America. He is credited as the primary architect of the policy expressed in the Ostend Manifesto. The experienced and cautious <b>Buchanan</b> <b>is</b> believed to have written the document and moderated Soulé's aggressive tone. Soulé highly favored expansion of Southern influence outside the current Union of States. His belief in Manifest Destiny led him to prophesy [...] "absorption of the entire continent and its island appendages" [...] by the U.S. Mason's Virginian roots predisposed him to the sentiments expressed in the document, but he later regretted his actions. Buchanan's exact motivations remain unclear despite his expansionist tendencies, but {{it has been suggested that}} he was seduced by visions of the presidency, which he would go on to win in 1856.

500|$|Two months later, amid {{reports that}} paleoconservative {{political}} commentator and adviser Pat Buchanan {{was about to}} join the Reform Party to seek the nomination, Trump {{announced that he would}} consider running as a sign of respect for Ventura.

[...] He expected that a primary battle between the two would be [...] "nasty." [...] According to columnist Robert Novak, Bush operatives concerned about a third party run by Buchanan contacted Ventura indirectly about preventing Buchanan's nomination. [...] Novak argued that Trump [...] "seems a bad match with Perot's party, but he may be the GOP's last hope to stop Buchanan." [...] When Weicker decided not to seek the party's nomination due to internal bickering, Ventura reportedly went all in for Trump. [...] The media capitalized on a potential Trump versus Buchanan challenge, and Saturday Night Live satirized it with a skit in which Darrell Hammond portraying Trump and Chris Parnell as Buchanan pitched their candidacies to Ross Perot, played by Cheri Oteri.

60|$|This is as {{plain as}} adding up {{the weight of}} three small hogs. As Mr. Fillmore has no {{possible}} chance to carry Illinois for himself, it is plainly to his interest to let Fremont take it, and thus {{keep it out of}} the hands of Buchanan. Be not deceived. <b>Buchanan</b> <b>is</b> the hard horse to beat in this race. Let him have Illinois, and nothing can beat him; and he will get Illinois if men persist in throwing away votes upon Mr. Fillmore. Does some one persuade you that Mr. Fillmore can carry Illinois? Nonsense! There are over seventy newspapers in Illinois opposing Buchanan, only three or four of which support Mr. Fillmore, all the rest going for Fremont. Are not these newspapers a fair index of the proportion of the votes? If not, tell me why.|$|E

60|$|DEAR SIR:--I {{understand}} {{you are a}} Fillmore man. Let me prove to you that every vote withheld from Fremont and given to Fillmore in this State actually lessens Fillmore's chance of being President. Suppose Buchanan gets all the slave States and Pennsylvania, and any other one State besides; then he is elected, no matter who gets all the rest. But suppose Fillmore gets the two slave States of Maryland and Kentucky; then <b>Buchanan</b> <b>is</b> not elected; Fillmore goes into the House of Representatives, and may be made President by a compromise. But suppose, again, Fillmore's friends throw away a few thousand votes on him in Indiana and Illinois; it will inevitably give these States to Buchanan, which will more than compensate him {{for the loss of}} Maryland and Kentucky, will elect him, and leave Fillmore no chance in the House of Representatives or out of it.|$|E
60|$|The middle {{settlement}} is Upper Buchanan, whose river, the St. John's, owns a bar infamous {{as that of}} Lagos for surf and sharks. The southernmost, Lower <b>Buchanan,</b> <b>is</b> defended by a long and broken wall of black reef, but the village is far from smooth water. All these 'towns' occupy holes in a curtain of the densest and tallest greenery. They are composed of groups and scatters of whitewashed houses, half of them looking like chapels and the other like toys. Each has its adjunct of brown huts, the native quarter. These Bassá tribes must not be confounded with their neighbours the Krumen; the languages are quite different, and the latter is of much harsher sound. There is no doubt of this being {{a good place for}} engaging labour, and it is hoped that in due time Bassá-hands, who work well, will be engaged for the Gold Coast mines. At present, however, they avoid English ships, call themselves 'Americans,' and willingly serve on board the Yankee craft which load with coffee, cam-wood, and palm-oil.|$|E
