5000|$|Soon back {{in charge}} of the retail company, Avery read widely on business. Fearing more {{depression}} after World War II, which had usually followed wars, he misread the postwar economy. Demand and available private money fed a rise in the retail business for durable goods. He continued his <b>bearish</b> <b>position</b> under the Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower administrations. Unlike Sears, Avery resisted pension plans, insurance and profit sharing with employees; he refused to spend money on company expansion. Soon Sears far outperformed Montgomery Ward; by 1951 it had more than double the business volume and had surpassed Montgomery Ward in retail stores, while Avery was prepared to weather a depression. [...] Even after Avery resigned in 1954 as president, MW never regained its former position.|$|E
5000|$|Business {{commentator}} Henry Blodget wrote a {{piece for}} Business Insider in January 2008 entitled [...] "Ben Stein is an Idiot," [...] stating that Steins criticism of those with <b>bearish</b> views and <b>positions</b> on the market was either [...] "delusional," [...] or a deliberate and [...] "shrewd" [...] attempt to create false controversy and drive up web traffic.|$|R
5000|$|Odey came to wide {{attention}} in 2008 when he paid himself Â£28 million after successfully anticipating the credit crunch. That year his return was 54.8 per cent. He had been <b>bearish</b> about the <b>position</b> of banks {{for a number}} of years, shorting Bradford & Bingley as early as 2005, questioning the German landesbanks and warning consistently about the dangers of debt and inflated house prices. He continued his short positions into early 2009 but in April took longer positions as he predicted the market rally of that year. The Times newspaper selected Odey as a [...] "Business Big Shot" [...] in 2008.|$|R
