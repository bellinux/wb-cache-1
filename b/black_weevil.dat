50|$|In the 21st century {{overpopulation}} {{has become}} such a problem that scientists begin preparing for the colonization of Mars. Their first steps in the terraforming of Mars involve seeding the planet with moss in order to absorb the sunlight and create a hospitable atmosphere as well as increase the surface temperature. They also introduce cockroaches in order to spread the moss.500 years later in the year 2599 a manned mission is sent to the red planet to clear out the cockroach colony in preparation for the human colonization of Mars. The crew is an international team of misfits and criminals who are given the opportunity {{to take part in the}} mission to gain forgiveness for their crimes.They enter the new atmosphere aboard the BUGS 2 and find the terraforming to have been successful. They release a roach bomb but when they walk onto the surface they do not find any dead roaches among the moss. Eventually they come upon human-sized anthropomorphic cockroaches wielding clubs that quickly kill two of the humans with their superior speed and physical strength. They determine that these creatures are the result of the accelerated evolution of the original small roaches sent by humans to aid in the terraforming efforts 500 years earlier.In order to combat the creatures the team is given a range of specially concocted DNA infusions individually designed to give each member of the team special powers. God Lee is eager to accept the infusion, believing that his powers will also give him added bargaining power when he returns to Earth. He walks on the surface of Mars and injects the DNA when he encounters a giant cockroach, transforming into a miidera beetle (Pheropsophus jessoensis) with the power to emit fire. The cockroach survives the fire blast and kills God Lee.A giant cockroach climbs on top of the spacecraft breaks through its transparent shell, killing two members of the team as it falls. Captain Dojima injects the DNA and transforms into a bullet ant (Paraponera clavata) with the power to lift one hundred times his own weight and kills the giant cockroach.Dozens of giant cockroaches swarm into the spacecraft as an expedition team prepares to venture out to grab parts from the BUGS 1, the vessel from the previous mission 10 years earlier, to get the current vessel BUGS 2 into shape to return to Earth. Tezuka injects the DNA and transforms into a Steninae MacLeay then sits on the back of the Mars rover and blows a jet of fire out to propel it across the terrain and kill giant cockroaches at the same time. The captain and Ichiro remain behind to battle the swarm of giant cockroaches. Ichiro injects the DNA and transforms into a sleeping chironomid (Polypedilum vanderplanki) then removes the oxygen from the vessel to cause the cockroaches to die of asphyxiation.The expedition team encounters a wave of giant cockroaches but they push through it. A second larger wave approaches and the team fears that Tezuka will not be able to survive this one so Osako volunteers to go out to help him. She injects the DNA and transforms into a <b>black</b> <b>weevil</b> Pachyrhynchus infernalis, an insect strong enough to survive being stepped on by an elephant. Mary joins her, injecting the DNA to become a rainbow stag beetle Phalacrognathus muelleri with optical camouflage capabilities. They protect Tezuka as he propels the rover through the second wave. The three are thrown from the vehicle and killed by the giant cockroaches as the rover rolls over and enters into autopilot mode to continue its journey.The remaining members discover and enter the BUGS 1. They find that it was already attempting to send something back to Earth. Outside two more members of the team are shot by giant cockroaches wielding large firearms. It is revealed that Ko Honda, the person who sent the team on this mission, is in communication with the giant cockroaches, who appear to have human intelligence. Keisuke Dojima injects the DNA and transforms into a deadly Asian giant hornet while Jim Muto injects the DNA and transforms into a desert locust with flying and powerful kicking and jumping abilities. Zhang Ming-Ming injects the DNA and transforms into an orchid mantis, a carnivorous insect. They then discover giant pyramids on the surface of Mars.Asuka Moriki appears alive aboard the BUGS 2 and transformed into an emerald cockroach wasp, capable of entering the bodies of giant cockroaches and manipulating them. She revives Ichiro with water and they launch the BUGS 2 back toward Earth with a giant cockroach egg on board. The egg hatches and the giant cockroaches inside resist Asuka's manipulation and kill her.Surprised at the new evolutionary advantage of the giant cockroaches, Ko Honda commands the BUGS 2 to fall back to the surface of Mars. The cockroaches aboard the BUGS 2 call for the assistance of the cockroaches on the surface, who sprout wings and ascend into the sky to soften the landing of the BUGS 2.Back on the surface they face the remaining members of the human expedition team, all of whom inject another dose of DNA to transform and do battle with the hordes of cockroaches. Over the course of the battle they discover that taking a second dose will create an enhanced transformation with increased powers. Jim injects a third time, causing irreversible transformation. Shokichi attempts to defend him and is injured.Nanao appears, transformed into a silk moth, and spreads her dust over the cockroach horde. A cockroach fires a weapon at her, causing an explosion that destroys the cockroach horde as well as Nanao. Jim and Shokichi escape the explosion and fly away, only to fall back to the surface where Jim dies in his permanent insect form. Shokichi boards the BUGS 2 again and confronts Ichiro, who saves him from a cockroach attack then suggests that they return to Earth quickly on a two-person spacecraft. As they blast off the cockroaches decide against flying after them.Back on Earth Sakakibara fears what the reaction will be when Earth learns of their actions. Ko Honda admits that it would be their downfall and suggests preventing the vessel from returning to Earth and then disappearing from Japanese society. She attempts to shoot him but he stops the bullet and tosses a spider at her which releases a toxic purple spray and kills her.The film ends with Ichiro and Shokichi in the small vessel discussing their plans for the future. Ichiro plans to build a tomb for Nanao and decides to return to Mars.|$|E

40|$|The {{context of}} this study is the {{pollution}} of soils and water by a persistent organo-chlorinated insecticide, chlordecone, in a tropical environment. The application of chlordecone to control the banana <b>black</b> <b>weevil</b> has led to continuing diffuse pollution of soils, and to its being a source of contamination for cultivated plants, as well as for terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Chlordecone is toxic and stable and {{is considered to be a}} persistent organic pesticide. Consequently, the amounts of chlordecone that could migrate through the environment and contaminate agricultural products need to be controlled. We measured the impact of two composts (5 % weight) on chlordecone sequestration in andosols. To this end, we first characterized the transfer of chlordecone from soil to water, and then its transfer from soil to plants. After 3 months of maturation, soil-water and soil-plant transfers were reduced by a factor of from 3 to 10. We also showed that adding compost to contaminated soils increases chlordecone sequestration because it leads to changes in soil microstructure in the form of pore collapse and closure of the fractal structure of the allophane content.

Persistence of chlordecone in soils and water for numerous decades even centuries causes global public health and socio-economic concerns. In order to investigate the biodegradability of chlordecone, microbial enrichment cultures from soils contaminated by chlordecone or other organochlorines and from sludge of a wastewater treatment plant have been conducted. Different experimental procedures including original microcosms were carried out anaerobically {{over long periods of}} time. GC-MS monitoring resulted in the detection of chlorinated derivatives in several cultures, consistent with chlordecone biotransformation. More interestingly, disappearance of chlordecone (50 µg/mL) in two bacterial consortia was concomitant with the accumulation of a major metabolite of formula C 9 Cl 5 H 3 (named B 1) as well as two minor metabolites C 10 Cl 9 HO (named A 1) and C 9 Cl 4 H 4 (named B 3).

40|$|Introduction. Chlordecone (CLD), an {{organochlorine}} formerly used {{to control}} the banana <b>black</b> <b>weevil,</b> is strongly adsorbed on soils, particularly on andosols. A simplified analytical procedure for the quantitative determination of chlordecone residues in water and micro-samples of soil and plants was compared with a standard method. Materials and methods. The procedure combines a simplified sampling protocol and a 10 -min solid phase microextraction (SPME), followed by gas chromatographic separation (GC) and mass spectrometric (MS and MS/MS) identification. Quantitation of CLD used a standard addition method with zero extrapolation. First, seventy samples were analysed using the proposed method and the standard method based on hot solvent extraction. Second, fifteen soil samples were analysed with two SPME methods followed by GC-MS but using CLD labelled with C 13 as an internal standard or the proposed method. Results and discussion. The detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) limits of our SPME extraction procedure were determined for GC-MS and GC-MS/MS with water, plant (pineapple roots) and soil samples: in water for MS/MS, LODMS/MS-water = 0. 5 ng×L– 1, LOQMS/MS-water = 2. 0 ng×L– 1; in andosol for MS/MS, LODMS/MS-soil = 15. 0 ng×kg– 1 dw, LOQMS/MS-soil = 80. 0 ng×kg– 1 dw. Data from the seventy contaminated soils obtained with the proposed method and the standard method showed a correlation coefficient of r = 0. 86. Data obtained by the two SPME/GC-MS quantitation procedures showed a correlation of r = 0. 8073. Conclusion. The method proposes a simplified sample preparation and extraction of CLD in water, plant and soil samples, with no solvent manipulation and which is not time-consuming. The LOD and LOQ {{were similar to those}} obtained with other currently used methods. The method is reliable and accurate and may be considered as a good tool for research purposes.

40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} (EPN) and entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) are pathogens {{which require}} an insect host to fulfil their life cycle and {{are commonly used}} as biocontrol agents. Studies have shown {{that a combination of}} EPN and EPF can result in greater insect mortality when compared to the agents applied alone. This interaction could possibly reduce the cost and quantities of single dose applications, inferring a synergistic effect. However, combinations of these pathogens may also result in additive or antagonistic interactions which would be of no benefit to growers. Hylobius abietis (large pine weevil) and Otiorhynchus sulcatus (<b>black</b> vine <b>weevil)</b> cause economic damage to forestry and horticultural crops, respectively. Large pine weevil larvae develop in the tree stumps, emerge as adults and feed on the bark of newly planted saplings, causing extensive mortality. <b>Black</b> vine <b>weevil</b> larvae kill plants by feeding on the roots and adults cause cosmetic damage. In this investigation, laboratory and field trials were conducted against large pine weevil larvae to determine whether interactions occur if EPN and EPF were applied simultaneously. EPN and EPF have already been shown to interact synergistically against the vine weevil in laboratory conditions. These experiments were repeated to investigate if synergistic interactions could be reproduced. Synergistic interactions were found with EPN and EPF against the large pine weevil in some laboratory experiments. However, antagonism and additivity were also recorded and synergism could not be predictably achieved. The field trial against the large pine weevil resulted in additivity. This indicates that the combined application of EPN and EPF would not be a better option than single applications.

40|$|International audienceChlordecone (CLD) is an {{organochlorine}} insecticide {{that was used}} from 1978 to 1993 in the French West Indies (FWI) to control the populations of <b>black</b> <b>weevil</b> in banana plantations. This pesticide, with recognized neurotoxic, endrocrine, reproductive and carcinogenic effects, is nowadays responsible of an unprecedented sanitary, economic and social crisis in FWI. Thanks to the management options taken in the past years by the authorities to avoid the population dietary exposure the crisis is fortunately essentially contained. A final {{solution to the problem}} would consist however to eliminate the source of CLD responsible for the diffuse pollution of all the FWI environmental compartments and related food resources and so to destroy the stock of CLD still presents in the soils. One of the cheapest and most environmental friendly destruction methods corresponds to microbial degradation. Such a mode of destruction seems to be particularly appropriate in the case of FWI since it can often be implemented in situ, using techniques (e. g., watering; addition of nutrients, labile organic matter, microorganisms) that are fairly easy to incorporate into existing agricultural practices. The latter is important as the pollution is estimated to cover some 19, 000 ha of arable lands. Until now however {{there is no evidence of}} natural attenuation in the environments impacted by chlordecone and so of the possibility to stimulate the rate of the process. The reason usually advocated to explain this apparent absence of degradation in the environment is the peculiar chemical structure of CLD (bishomocubane “cage” structure with a high steric hindrance caused by the 10 chlorine atoms bound to the cage), coupled to its low aqueous solubility (3 mg/l at 20 °C) and high hydrophobicity (Log Kow 20 °C, pH 7 = 4. 5) that would make it refractory to degradation. In this chapter through a thermodynamic approach, we demonstrate that there is no energetic reason why the structure of CLD should not be amenable to microbial degradation and we propose some possible reasons for the apparent absence of CLD degradation in FWI and what could be done to reverse the situation...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Two {{types of}} {{exogenous}} mortality factors, density-independent and density-dependent, were identified for the <b>black</b> vine <b>weevil,</b> Otiorhynchus sulcatus Fab., developing on container grown rhododendrons. The {{addition of the}} insecticide acephate, (O.

Acephate when applied as a drench, killed both early and late instar larvae. The mode of entry was primarily contact. Application of acephate drenches to control early instar (I-III) larvae prevents fatal injury (girdling) to container grown rhododendrons. A life table was constructed for the <b>black</b> vine <b>weevil</b> on container grown rhododendrons at three densities (beginning with 25, 75, and 150 eggs per plant) {{in the process of}} identifying mortality factors. The greatest mortality occurred during the first instar as the larvae become established on the root systems of host plants. At high larval densities (> 4 larvae per plant, in a 23 x 22 cm plastic container) the amount of available stem exoxylary tissue became a density-dependent mortality factor. This is because the larvae require exoxylary tissue to successfully complete development on rhododendron, although they do not feed on it prior to the fourth instar. Therefore, mortality increased with an increase in insect density because of competition for the limited amount of exoxylary tissue. The percent of stem exoxylary tissue removed (consumed) by larvae was dependent on the volume of rhododendron roots. Plants with large (1622 ± 223 ml) root volumes had significantly less (P< 0. 01) stem exoxylary tissue removed than plants with small (360 ± 265 ml) root volumes...|$|R

The assessment was finalized in October 2014 by VKM’s Panel on Plant Protection Products...|$|R
50|$|Otiorhynchus (often spelt Otiorrhynchus) {{is a large}} genus of weevils in {{the family}} Curculionidae. Many species of the genus, {{particularly}} the <b>black</b> vine <b>weevil</b> (O. sulcatus) and the strawberry root weevil (O. ovatus), are important pests, both as larvae and as adults. Larvae feed on plant roots. Adults are flightless with fused elytra and feed at night on plant foliage. In many species of the genus at least some races are polyploid and parthenogenetic, {{while the rest of}} the races and species are diploid and bisexual. Otiorhynchus weevils, particularly O. scaber, have been a popular subject for studies of the evolution of parthenogenesis. The genus is native to the Palearctic region. However, sixteen species were inadvertently introduced to North America and have become widespread there.A number of species are troglobites, cave-dwelling animals that lack eyes.|$|R
50|$|The most {{well-known}} invertebrate {{may be a}} species of midge (Culicoides impunctatus), a tiny flying gnat that is the scourge of summer visitors and residents alike. Its predations result {{in the loss of}} up to 20% of summer working days in the forestry industry. Others of significance include the pine <b>weevil,</b> <b>black</b> pine beetle, clytra beetle, and the timberman, a long-horned beetle. The archaeological site at Skara Brae provided the earliest known record of the human flea, Pulex irritans in Europe.|$|R
40|$|Direct {{application}} of either cell solutions or cell free-filtrates from symbiotic bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila can control insects on leaves and in soils. Larvae of the beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua), diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), <b>black</b> vine <b>weevil</b> (Otiorhynchus sulcatus) and nymphs of desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) {{were killed by}} both cell treatments and cell-free filtrates, which were equally effective. Therefore, the toxin present in both treatments {{was responsible for the}} lethal effects. Cells of X. nematophila recovered from the haemocoele of all treated insects, indicating that cells were able to move from the external environment and enter insects {{in the absence of the}} nematode vector. The toxicity of cell suspensions and cell-free filtrates, as assessed by Galleria mellonella mortality, persisted for up to 5 months in soil indicating that soil treatments with either cells or cell-free filtrates controlled O. sulcatus in potted plants.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the persistence of Metarhizium anisopliae (F 52), measured as infectivity against <b>black</b> vine <b>weevil</b> larvae, in a soilless potting medium at six wholesale nursery locations across the Willamette Valley, Oregon. A granule formulation (0. 30 and 0. 60 kg/m 3) was incorporated into media at planting and fungal persistence determined over two growing seasons. The fungus persisted in the potting media over the duration of the experiment with 50 – 60 % of the larvae exposed to treated media becoming infected at the end of the experiment. The percentage of infected larvae gradually declined from 790 % on week 3 to 40 – 60 % by week 19. Larval infection rebounded over the fall and winter months of 2004 to 75 – 80 % followed again by a slow decline over the course of the second growing season. Published by Elsevier Inc...|$|R
