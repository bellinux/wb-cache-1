40|$|Installing {{deep water}} risers in harsh {{environmental}} conditions {{even in the}} icing environment, {{in the near future}} seems like inevitable. Especially in the Norwegian Sea, the development of deep water technology requires an urgent solution of how to transfer hydrocarbons from sea bed to the host facility in a remote area with considering hostile environment conditions. In every subsea production system combined with a floating facility, the need of risers is a must. Deeper water causes various challenges, for instance; higher payload of the vessel, increase probability of collapse failure of the riser, higher probability for riser failure due to buckling and fatigue issue at the touch-down-point (TDP) as well as presence of Vortex Induce Vibration (VIV) in the long suspended riser span. In addition, the polar climate which is occurring in the Norwegian Sea should be considered during designing, installing and operating of the system which caused this area to be different from other places. In order to reduce excessive floater motions, an uncoupled riser system is introduced. By using buoy elements, the riser system is able decouple the motion effect of the floater, riser and mooring system that may magnify the extreme hull/floater response. This can significantly improve strength and fatigue performance of the riser. This system is widely used in deep water conditions with various riser configurations. In general, an uncoupled riser system consists of two different types of riser concepts (flexible and steel) with buoy in between. There are three main components in this configuration; a flexible jumper that is directly connected to the floater, a sub-surface <b>buoyancy</b> <b>module</b> at the connection point, and a steel riser at the bottom parts. The flexible jumper is used to absorb the floater motions, and the result the configuration gives the optimum riser concept which is best suited for deep water conditions. In this topic, we limit the uncoupled riser configurations into two types; Catenary Offset Buoyant Riser Assembly (COBRA) and Single Line Offset Riser (SLOR). The difference between these two riser configurations is at the bottom part and at the connection point; COBRA configures the steel pipe as a catenary riser with a long-slender sub-surface <b>buoyancy</b> <b>module</b> on the top which is tethered down to sea bed via mooring lines while SLOR configures the steel pipe as a tensioned riser by using an air can as a <b>buoyancy</b> <b>module</b> to maintain the riser in tensioned position all time. By means of these riser configurations we have the possibility to use different types of riser arrangements since a standalone flexible riser is very expensive to use in deep water conditions. The main advantage of the two uncoupled riser configurations is that they enable possibilities for the floater to drift/side-step in case of drifting icebergs, which {{will be one of the}} study cases. This thesis focuses on a comparison study of the two uncoupled riser configurations based on ultimate limit state (ULS) and accidental limit state (ALS) results by considering the possibility to avoid/prevent iceberg collision. As explained previously, the risers to be studied are set to be installed in the Norwegian Sea which has harsh environmental conditions. Three different water depths have been chosen on purpose, which are 100 m, 400 m, and 1500 m. In the event of iceberg approach, this thesis work presents two solutions for comparison study. The two solutions are to drift/side-step the floating structure or to disconnect the riser/mooring system using a disconnectable turret. The repot will suggest the optimum solutions; the most suitable uncoupled riser configuration for the Norwegian Sea condition with respect to the riser performance for the case of floater drift off and the geometry of a disconnected riser. Based on detail strength analysis in operating and accidental conditions, this thesis concludes that COBRA riser concept has robust and efficient design to install in the Norwegian Sea conditions. In addition, the COBRA configuration in 1500 m water depth is feasible to perform a 250 m side-stepping in the event of an iceberg approach...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an evolutionary structural topology optimization method {{for the design}} of completely submerged buoyant modules with design-dependent fluid pressure loading. This type of structure is used to support offshore rig installation and pipeline transportation at all water depths. The proposed optimization method seeks to identify the buoy design that has the highest stiffness, allowing it to withstand deepwater pressure, uses the least material and has a minimum prescribed buoyancy. Laplace's equation is used to simulate underwater fluid pressure, and a polymer <b>buoyancy</b> <b>module</b> is considered to be linearly elastic. Both domains are solved with the finite element method. Using an extended bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) method, the design-dependent pressure loads are modelled in a straightforward manner without any need for pressure surface parametrization. A new buoyancy inequality constraint sets a minimum required buoyancy effect, measured by the joint volume of the structure and its interior voids. Solid elements with low strain energy are iteratively removed from the initial design domain until a certain prescribed volume fraction.

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this paper details {{the design of a}} facility for the water permeability testing of subsea drill-string riser <b>buoyancy</b> <b>modules.</b> The facility has been built and commissioned and is unique in the UK The only other test facility of this sort exists at the South Western Research Institute at San Antonio in Texas, USA. <b>Buoyancy</b> <b>modules</b> are used to reduce the effective weight of a subsea drill-string riser so as to avoid buckling and vibration problems in service. This weight reduction increases the natural frequencies of the riser well above typical frequencies of excitation as a result of drilling. The geometry of the modules depends on the particular riser design but generally approximates to a long, semi-circular section, sleeve which is clamped round the length of the riser. Many modules are used in service to surround the whole length of the riser from the sea bed to the surface. Individual module lengths vary but tend to be around the 5 m mark. The most important module performance characteristics are the effective buoyancy force in water and the ability of the module to resist water ingress at the high hydrostatic pressures encountered in deep water. These pressures can reach up to 345 bar in the deepest water, and are therefore potentially capable of forcing water into the material of the module. The concept behind the testing facility is a computerized data logging system that detects and computes minute weight changes in sample sections of the <b>buoyancy</b> riser <b>module</b> due to the ingress of sea water at very high hydrostatic pressures. The system simulates the hydrostatic conditions found in deep water, and provides a specific printout of pressure and buoyancy quantities over test periods of up to 100 hours; the format of the printout is to the standard generally required by industry. The work was carried out in recognition of the need for a UK facility which would enable manufacturers of the module material, and also customers purchasing the modules, to have confidence that the required buoyancy performance of the modules can be maintained under typical subsea conditions—without necessarily incurring the very high costs of testing in the US...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{techniques}} are developed which permit {{the identification of}} power-in and power-out regions of long cylinders exposed to flow-induced vibration. The data used to illustrate the techniques come from a set of vortex-induced vibration model tests conducted by Shell Oil Co in 2011 at the Marintek facility in Trondheim, Norway. The identification of power-in regions allows one to address the practical problem of determining {{the primary source of}} vibration energy when the long cylinder has components of various shapes, such as when <b>buoyancy</b> <b>modules</b> are used in staggered configurations. The identification of power-out regions has a direct practical connection to the estimation of damping magnitude and location on cylinders with varying cross-sections in non-uniform flows. The vibration intensity technique is used in this thesis to locate the power-in and power-out regions of a long flexible cylinder in a steady flow. This method also allows the exploration of the occurrence of secondary power-in regions after suppressing the primary power-in zones. Results may provide useful guidance for the installation and repair of suppression devices such as helical strakes. Three methods are presented to address a practical problem: "When <b>buoyancy</b> <b>modules</b> are applied in a staggered pattern on an otherwise bare cylinder, which distribution patterns result in VIV response dominated by buoyant or bare regions?" Based on the data analysis of five staggered buoyancy pipes, the three methods yielded the same results in identifying the winner. A dimensionless parameter, the "predictor", is proposed. The predictor relies only on the diameters and lengths of bare and buoyant segment. The predictor is verified with an independent set of VIV tests. An equivalent damping parameter is proposed for the purpose of classifying all flexible cylinder VIV response cases onto a single plot of response versus the equivalent damping parameter. After taking Reynolds number into account, results show that the amplitude for pipes with and without helical strakes at different Reynolds numbers can be collapsed onto a single curve {{as a function of the}} newly defined equivalent damping parameter. by Zhibiao Rao.

40|$|Offshore ultra {{deepwater}} {{field is}} being promising {{as the future}} {{of oil and gas}} reserves. The advancement of technology in ultra deepwater has been leading Brazil into one of the promising offshore market. A Brazilian state-owned oil operator, Petrobras, confirms that 33 % from their total exploration area are located at water depth below 1500 m (Salies, 2005). It can be seen that the future of oil and gas exploration and production lies in ultra deepwater. The development of ultra deepwater field posed many challenges, in particular, on the selection of the riser concept. For ultra deepwater environment, the long suspended length of riser will significantly increase the vessel payload. High external hydrostatic pressure on the riser will increase the probability of collapse failure. Large dynamic motions of the vessel due to waves, and also large vessel offsets from wind, current and slow-drift motion yields potential buckling issues at the touch-down-point (TDP). In addition, potential fatigue problems due to vessel motions and soil-riser interactions also present at touch-down-point (TDP) area. Large current speed in deepwater field might also lead to vortex induced vibration (VIV) which eventually will contribute to significant fatigue damage for particular riser sections. By looking into these challenges, {{it is very important to}} select the most appropriate riser concept for the ultra deepwater field. Catenary Offset Buoyant Riser Assembly (COBRA) as newly developed hybrid riser concept offers a solution to overcome the challenges in ultra deepwater field. In general, COBRA riser arrangement consists of a catenary riser section with a long-slender sub-surface <b>buoyancy</b> <b>module</b> on top which is tethered down to sea bed via two mooring lines. The catenary section from top of the sub-surface buoy is connected to the floater by a flexible jumper. This flexible jumper can effectively absorb the floater motions, which give significant improvements for both strength and fatigue performance on the overall system. As a hybrid riser concept, this concept offers cost effective solution by avoiding all the expensive bottom assemblies that normally needed for a hybrid riser concept. This thesis focuses on COBRA riser concept for offshore Brazil ultra deepwater environment, specifically for Santos Basin Central Cluster region at 2200 m water depth. It is observed that there is common sudden change phenomenon on the current direction in Santos Basin area. In this thesis, the effect of bidirectional (2 -directions) current is analyzed, and the comparison with unidirectional current is discussed thoroughly. The analyses are focused on the global strength design performance under extreme environmental load and global fatigue design performance of the riser due to wave induced and VIV induced. This thesis captures detail analysis of COBRA base case configuration. In addition, further sensitivity studies from the base case riser arrangement are also presented. The parameter on sensitivity studies are determined based on possible alternative riser arrangements, i. e. locating the sub-surface buoyancy in deeper area, connecting the flexible jumper through the bottom section of the sub-surface buoyancy, and also alternative buoyancy tethers configurations on the seabed.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyAdvanced modern {{technologies}} and {{growing demand for}} oil and gas has led to the discovery and development of smaller and remote fields that were once considered uneconomical. They are made economically more viable by employing a subsea development scheme and directing the output to existing platform for production and processing instead of having their own platform. This has necessitated the introduction of inline structures in the pipelines with the possibility to connect these remote fields when they are developed for production. However the presence of these structures introduces many installation challenges including increased weight and additional environmental loading. In some cases this might drastically reduce the limiting sea state for installation. For the scope of the thesis work, any structure {{in the middle of the}} pipeline with stiffness and weight greater than the pipeline is considered as an inline structure. A riser and pipeline installation using J-Tube pull in method is considered as the case study for analysis in the thesis. Analysis and parametric study of the installation is made with emphasis on the initiation phase to determine the limiting sea state for the safe installation of the pipeline. The main focus of the thesis would be to analyze the possibilities to optimize the limiting sea state for the installation of the J-tube seal with the help of buoyancy units by creating a neutrally buoyant catenary during installation. An attempt to develop a generalized optimization procedure to determine the optimal buoyancy unit configuration for all inline structure installation is made although the results indicate that it might be very case specific and a general method might not exist. Analysis to understand the influence of the type of buoyancy unit, the position on the pipeline catenary, net buoyancy, number of <b>buoyancy</b> <b>modules</b> and various other parametric studies are made. In addition, challenges encountered during an inline structure installation and the modifications required to carry out the installation from the vessel is briefly discussed. The analysis reveals that geometry of the buoyancy does not have appreciable impact. A sensitivity study on the added mass of the buoyancy shows that an increased added mass reduces the buckling utilization by its out-of-phase dynamic response with that of the catenary. Sagbend buckling is the most critical concern for installation and it is at its maximum when the structure is at the sagbend. It also reveals that the best results are achieved when the net <b>buoyancy</b> of the <b>module</b> is equal to the excess weight in the catenary due to the structure.

The primary goal {{of the project was}} to evaluate how flow-induced vibration of a marine riser is affected by placement of staggered buoyancy along the riser. The riser was subjected to both sheared and uniform flow, and was tested with various configurations of buoyancy. Cross-flow measurements of acceleration were analyzed to determine dominant response frequency and vibration amplitude. Tension and flow velocity were also measured. It is shown that a riser with 50 % staggered buoyancy or greater will have response dominated by vortex shedding on the large diameter <b>buoyancy</b> <b>modules.</b> It is also found that the addition of buoyancy may decrease fatigue damage rate, provided that measures are taken to minimize increases in the ratio of mass per unit length of the riser to mean tension. It is primarily the decrease in vortex shedding frequency due to the larger diameter that accounts for any reduction in fatigue damage rate. Unfortunately, the benefits gained from the addition of buoyancy may be undone by the typical increase in mass and decrease in riser tension that occur when buoyancy is present...|$|R

The {{source of data}} is a recent model test, conducted by SHELL Exploration and Production at the MARINTEK Ocean Basin in Trondheim Norway. A pipe model with five buoyancy configurations was tested. The results of these tests show that (1) the excitation on the bare and buoyant regions could be identified by frequency, because the bare and buoyant regions are associated with two different frequencies due to the different diameters; (2) a new phenomenon was observed; A third frequency in the spectrum is found {{not to be a}} multiple of the frequency associated with either bare or buoyancy regions, but the sum of the frequency associated with bare region and twice of the frequency associated with buoyancy region; (3) the contribution of the response at this third frequency to the total amplitude is small; (4) the power dissipated by damping at each excitation frequency is the metric used to determine the winner of excitation competition. For most buoyancy configurations, the excitation on buoyancy regions dominates the VIV response; (5) a formula is proposed to predict the winner of the excitation competition between bare and buoyant segments for a given buoyancy coverage.

40|$|The main {{concerns}} during drilling {{operations are}} riser integrity and maintaining well control. This thesis has mainly been {{focusing on the}} problems and challenges faced with the marine riser system to illuminate high risk areas related to riser integrity. A marine riser system consists generally of four main elements; the upper marine riser package, riser joints, lower marine riser package, and the blowout preventer, each playing {{an important part in}} the marine riser system. The marine riser function is to supports and guide the auxiliary lines used to control the well, and connect and provide for fluid communication between the drilling vessel and the wellhead. Failure to the marine riser is related to technical problems associated with old design and lack of correct operating procedure and maintenance method. Elements like the telescopic joint haven’t change the design since the 1960 ’s and are exposed to problems like unplanned discharge caused of premature war to the packer element. Problems with the telescopic joint are not unique there are also experienced failure with tensioner system, flex joint and blowout preventer. Studies show that blowout preventer failure cases the longest downtime and most expensive repairs. Over 50 % of blowout preventer failures are related to the control system and are caused by failure to the hydraulic components. Exploration activity forces the drilling contractor further out and into deeper water depths, like the Gulf of Mexico or outside the Coast of Brazil. Greater water depths challenge the riser system on many places. Deepwater operations means harsher environment and problems in the forms of large waves, strong currents and increased pressure from the water column, all affecting the operations and riser pipe in several ways. The environmental issues causes the riser to fail due to increased tensile load, vortex induced vibrations, environmentally induced cracks and increased corrosion attacks. The increased tensile load on the riser pipe place importance on the top tension capacity of the rig and the riser pipe wall thickness. Moving into deeper ground, many rigs reach their tension capacity and must use <b>buoyancy</b> <b>modules</b> to provide sufficient tension to the riser. Many of the problems could be addressed using simple solution, like implementing correct maintenance program or address the issues in the design phase. But economical impetus holds the development back.

Commonly used mitigation measures in the offshore industry are by continuous burial or rock damping to avoid buckling of the pipeline completely; and by using various methods to trigger lateral buckling in a controlled and effective manner at a relatively low axial compressive force, for example snake lay, artificial vertical imperfections & <b>buoyancy</b> <b>modules.</b> These mitigation measures require the implementation of additional methods on the seabed, which often appear with significant cost. Recent developments have shown how the use of intermittent residual curvature sections during reel-lay installation of pipelines {{can be used to}} control global pipeline thermal buckling in the operational phase. The method was first implemented in Statoil’s Skuld project in the Norwegian sea in 2012. Results have shown that every section of the residual curvature is triggered as expected and ensured the sharing of thermal expansion. No additional methods were required to ensure the utilization within acceptable criteria. The method was found to be rewarding and cost effective than the above mentioned conventional mitigation methods. The residual curvature sections are created as under-straightened sections in the vertical plane at the straightener of the reel-lay vessel. These convex upward residual sections create an additional imperfection in the pipeline and lead to pipe roll as it moves through the under-bend due to reversed bending. If the RCM is to be used effectively as a means for lateral buckling control, the residual curvature sections should acquire a position of stable equilibrium by ending the roll in the horizontal plane at the seabed. The tendency of the pipeline to bend and roll due to the residual curvature sections introduced on the reel ship can be estimated by energy approach. The total work done from the water surface to the seabed TDP is the sum of the bending and roll contribution. After initiating roll, the pipeline ends up in an equilibrium position when the total estimated work done is minimum and the corresponding angle gives the roll angle. Considering the aspects discussed above, the current work focuses on an analytical energy approach method for the estimation of the total work done to bend and twist the pipeline from the surface to the seabed; and estimate pipeline roll at the seabed TDP. Sensitivity studies of various parameters are carried out based on single pipe sections of 12 ” ID & 14 ” ID as well as 18 ” OD pipe-in-pipe in water depth of 360 m, 800 m and 1200 m. The thesis also includes a brief model of pipeline installation by introducing pre-bent curvature section using global analysis tool OrcaFlex. The purpose is to compare the results against the analytical method...|$|R
