5|$|The Oslo Metro {{operates}} in all fifteen boroughs of Oslo, {{as well as}} reaching a bit inside the neighbouring municipality of Bærum. There are five lines, numbered 1 through 5, each color-coded. They all pass through the Common Tunnel, serving eight branch lines. In addition two lines operate to the Ring Line. Two branches are served by two lines each: the Grorud branch is served by both lines 4 and 5, while the Lambertseter branch has full-time service <b>by</b> <b>line</b> 4 and limited service <b>by</b> <b>line</b> 1.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} connected to Egertorget via Stortorvet. After {{the line was}} taken over by KSS, it was given service number 9 and operated with a twelve-minute headway, connecting via the city center to Skøyen on the Skøyen Line. When the Sinsen Line opened, the souther part of the Rodeløkka was also served <b>by</b> <b>Line</b> 13, which gave a six-minute headway south of Helgesens gate. From 29 June 1924, after the takeover of Oslo Sporveier, the headway was changed to fifteen minutes. From 29 May 1927, Line 13 was replaced with Line 12, and from 19 June, Line 9 became Line 17, which continued along the Ullevål Hageby Line {{on the other side of}} the city center. From 19 January 1937, the Sinsen service was also operated <b>by</b> <b>Line</b> 3. From 10 December 1939, Gullfisk trams were put into service on the Sinsen services. With the reopening of the Rodeløkka Line in 1955, the service was taken over <b>by</b> <b>Line</b> 13, which used SM53 trams. Ridership on the new line was less than predicted, and from 1959, the line was only served during rush-hour and started to turn at the Eastern Railway Station in the city center.|$|E

Next to the station is the tram station Sinsenkrysset, that {{has been part of}} the Sinsen Line of the Oslo Tramway since 1939. The station opened on 20 August 2006, as part of the first section of the Ring Line. The station is served <b>by</b> <b>line</b> 6 of the metro, as well as several local bus services. Sinsen is a mixed {{residential}} and commercial area.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature last {{assessed}} the Borneo shark as Endangered, based on 2005 data {{that do not}} include the recent specimens from Mukah. Previously, several fishery surveys within its supposed historical range had failed to find it. The Borneo shark's conservation status remains precarious given its very small range in waters subjected to intensive artisanal and commercial fishing. It is caught <b>by</b> <b>line</b> gear and used for meat, though it has minimal commercial significance.|$|E
5|$|The Røa Line {{is served}} <b>by</b> <b>Line</b> 2 of the Oslo Metro, which {{continues}} from Majorstuen via the Common Tunnel and {{connects to the}} Furuset Line. The line runs every 15 minutes, with enhanced service weekdays between 7 and 19 giving eight departures an hour. During late evenings and Saturday and Sunday mornings, it runs every 30 minutes. The {{lower part of the}} line, from Majorstuen to Borgen, is also served <b>by</b> <b>Line</b> 2, which continues along the Kolsås Line. Along this section, there is twice the frequency. Travel time from Østerås to Majorstuen is 16 minutes, to Stortinget is 20 minutes, and to Vestli on the Grorud Line is 50 minutes.

5|$|In the American camp, {{the mutual}} resentment between Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold finally {{exploded}} into open hostility. Gates quickly reported {{the action of}} September 19 to the Congress and Governor George Clinton of New York, but he failed to mention Arnold at all. The field commanders and men universally credited Arnold for their success. Almost all the troops involved were from Arnold's command and Arnold was the one directing the battle while Gates sat in his tent. Arnold protested, and the dispute escalated into a shouting match that ended with Gates relieving Arnold of his command and giving it to Benjamin Lincoln. Arnold asked for a transfer to Washington's command, which Gates granted, but instead of leaving he remained in his tent. There is no documentary evidence for a commonly recounted anecdote that a petition signed <b>by</b> <b>line</b> officers convinced Arnold to stay in camp.|$|E
5|$|Small {{bony fishes}} {{are the main}} prey of the nervous shark, while crustaceans, molluscs, and snakes may also be eaten. It is viviparous, with the {{developing}} embryos nourished through a placental connection. The details of its life history seem to vary depending on latitudefor example, {{the timing of the}} breeding season and the length of the gestation period. Females produce litters of one to six young either annually or biennially. The harmless nervous shark is caught incidentally by coastal gillnet fisheries and perhaps also <b>by</b> <b>line</b> and trawl fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species except in Australian waters, where its population seems healthy and has been listed under Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|The {{localization}} {{was done}} by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese, making dialogue sound like what a native speaker of English would say instead of strictly adhering the original's exact wording. The localization editor, Ben Bateman, did this by looking at the writing from a wider view, line <b>by</b> <b>line</b> or scene by scene rather than word by word or sentence by sentence, and thinking about how to convey the same ideas in English. Most parts of the game that include a joke in the localization also have a joke in the Japanese version, but a different one; Bateman did however try to make similar types of jokes, with similar contents and ideas. The game's use of Japanese language puns led to problems, as many of them relied on Japanese dialects to function; for these, Bateman replaced them with new puns in English. He was given mostly free rein in what he could change or add, as long as it did not disrupt the plot.|$|E
