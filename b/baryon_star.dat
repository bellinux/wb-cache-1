40|$|The {{mechanisms}} that trigger strong bursts {{of star formation}} in dwarf galaxies are poorly understood. Blue Compact Dwarfs (BCDs) are nearby starburst galaxies that may {{hold the key to}} understand these mechanisms. We are studying a sample of 18 BCDs using both new and archival HI data. In several cases we find that BCDs have a steeply-rising rotation curve that flattens in the outer parts. This points to a strong central concentration of mass. We introduce a new parameter to quantify the central mass concentration in dwarf galaxies (BCDs and irregulars) : the circular-velocity gradient V(Rd) /Rd, where Rd is the galaxy scale-length. We find that V(Rd) /Rd correlates with i) the central surface brightness; ii) the mean HI surface density over the stellar disk; and iii) the SFR density. BCDs have higher V(Rd) /Rd than typical irregulars, suggesting that the starburst activity is closely linked with the gravitational potential and the concentration of gas. We decompose the rotation curves of BCDs into mass components and find that <b>baryons</b> (<b>stars</b> and gas) are dynamically important. This is remarkable, as dwarf galaxies are commonly thought to be entirely dominated by dark matter.

40|$|Because {{of their}} {{superfluid}} properties, some compact astrophysical {{objects such as}} neutron stars may contain {{a significant part of}} their matter {{in the form of a}} Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). We consider a partially-relativistic model of self-gravitating BECs where the relation between the pressure and the rest-mass density is assumed to be quadratic (as in the case of classical BECs) but pressure effects are taken into account in the relation between the energy density and the rest-mass density. At high densities, we get a stiff equation of state similar to the one considered by Zel'dovich (1961) in the context of <b>baryon</b> <b>stars</b> in which the baryons interact through a vector meson field. We determine the maximum mass of general relativistic BEC stars described by this equation of state by using the formalism of Tooper (1965). This maximum mass is slightly larger than the maximum mass obtained by Chavanis and Harko (2012) using a fully-relativistic model. We also consider the possibility that dark matter is made of BECs and apply the partially-relativistic model of BECs to cosmology. In this model, we show that the universe experiences a stiff matter phase, followed by a dust matter phase, and finally by a dark energy phase (equivalent to a cosmological constant). The same evolution is obtained in Zel'dovich (1972) model which assumes that initially, near the cosmological singularity, the universe is filled with cold baryons. Interestingly, the Friedmann equations can be solved analytically in that case and provide a simple generalization of the ΛCDM model.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{importance}} of baryonic physics on predictions of the matter power spectrum as it is relevant for forthcoming weak lensing surveys. We quantify the impact of baryonic physics using a set of three cosmological numerical simulations. Each simulation has the same initial density field, but models {{a different set of}} physical processes. The first simulation evolves the density field using gravity alone, the second includes non-radiative gasdynamics, and the third includes radiative heating and cooling of <b>baryons,</b> <b>star</b> formation, and supernova feedback. We find that baryonic processes alter predictions for the matter power spectrum significantly relative to models that include only gravitational interactions. Our results imply that future weak lensing experiments such as LSST and SNAP will be very sensitive to the poorly-understood physics governing the nonlinear evolution of the baryonic component of the universe. The net effect is significantly larger {{in the case of the}} model with cooling and star formation, in which case our results imply that contemporary surveys such as the CFHT Wide survey may also be sensitive to baryonic processes. In particular, this effect could be important for forecasts of the constraining power of future surveys if information from scales larger than l ~ 1000 is included in the analysis. We find that deviations are caused primarily by the rearrangement of matter within individual dark matter halos relative to the gravity-only case, rather than a large-scale rearrangement of matter. Consequently, we propose a simple model, based on the phenomenological halo model of dark matter clustering, for baryonic effects that can be used to aid in the interpretation of forthcoming weak lensing data.

We study a specific solution of "hyperon puzzle", consisting in replacing a too soft hyperon core by a sufficiently stiff quark core. We construct an analytic approximation fitting very well modern EOSs of 2 SC and CFL color superconducting phases of quark matter. This allows us for simulating continua of sequences of first-order phase transitions from hadronic matter to the 2 SC, {{and then to the}} CFL state of color superconducting quark matter. We obtain constraints in the parameter space of the EOS of superconducting quark cores, resulting from M_max> 2 M_sol. We also derive constraints that would result from significantly higher measured masses. For 2. 4 M_sol required stiffness of the CFL quark core should have been close to the causality limit, the density jump at the phase transition being very small. Condition M_max > 2 M_sol puts strong constraints on the EOSs of the 2 SC and CFL phases of quark matter. Density jumps at the phase transitions have to be sufficiently small and sound speeds in quark matter - sufficiently large. A strict condition of thermodynamic stability of quark phase results in the maximum mass of hybrid stars similar to that of purely <b>baryon</b> <b>stars.</b> Therefore, to get M_max> 2 M_sol for stable hybrid stars, both sufficiently strong additional hyperon repulsion at high density baryon matter and a sufficiently stiff EOS of quark matter would be needed.

40|$|We {{construct}} a simple phenomenological {{model for the}} evolving galaxy population by incorporating pre-defined baryonic prescriptions into a dark matter hierarchical merger tree. Specifically the model {{is based on the}} simple gas-regulator model introduced by Lilly et al. 2013 coupled with the empirical quenching rules of Peng et al. 2010 / 12. The simplest model already does quite well in reproducing, without re-adjusting the input parameters, many observables including the Main Sequence sSFR-mass relation, the faint end slope of the galaxy mass function and the shape of the star-forming and passive mass functions. Compared with observations and/or the recent phenomenological model of Behroozi et al. 2013 based on epoch-dependent abundance-matching, our model also qualitatively reproduces the evolution of the Main Sequence sSFR(z) and SFRD(z) star formation rate density relations, the $M_s - M_h$ stellar-to-halo mass relation and also the $SFR - M_h$ relation. Quantitatively the evolution of sSFR(z) and SFRD(z) is not steep enough, the $M_s - M_h$ relation is not quite peaked enough and, surprisingly, the ratio of quenched to star-forming galaxies around M* is not quite high enough. We show that these deficiencies can simultaneously be solved by ad hoc allowing galaxies to re-ingest some of the gas previously expelled in winds, provided that this is done in a mass-dependent and epoch-dependent way. These allow the model galaxies to reduce an inherent tendency to saturate their star-formation efficiency. This emphasizes how efficient galaxies around M* are in converting <b>baryons</b> into <b>stars</b> and highlights the fact that quenching occurs just at the point when galaxies are rapidly approaching the maximum possible efficiency of converting <b>baryons</b> into <b>stars.</b> Comment: 26 pages, 20 figures, 14 tables, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journa...|$|R
40|$|We analyze 2. 8 -yr data of 1 - 100 GeV photons for {{clusters}} of galaxies, collected with the Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi satellite. By analyzing 49 nearby massive clusters located at high Galactic latitudes, we find no excess gamma-ray emission towards directions {{of the galaxy}} clusters. Using flux upper limits, we show that the Fornax cluster provides the most stringent constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section. Stacking a large sample of nearby clusters does not help improve the limit for most dark matter models. This suggests that a detailed modeling of the Fornax cluster is important for setting robust limits on the dark matter annihilation cross section based on clusters. We therefore perform the detailed mass modeling and predict the expected dark matter annihilation signals from the Fornax cluster, by taking into account effects of dark matter contraction and substructures. By modeling the mass distribution of <b>baryons</b> (<b>stars</b> and gas) around a central bright elliptical galaxy, NGC 1399, and using a modified contraction model motivated by numerical simulations, we show that the dark matter contraction boosts the annihilation signatures {{by a factor of}} 4. For dark matter masses around 10 GeV, the upper limit obtained on the annihilation cross section times relative velocity is <~ (2 - 3) x 10 ^{- 25 } cm^ 3 s^{- 1 }, which is within a factor of 10 from the value required to explain the dark matter relic density. This effect is more robust than the annihilation boost due to substructure, and it is more important unless the mass of the smallest subhalos is much smaller than that of the Sun.

40|$|The long-standing {{challenge}} {{of creating a}} Milky Way-like disk galaxy from cosmological simulations has motivated significant developments in both numerical methods and physical models in recent years. We investigate these two fundamental aspects in a new comparison project using a set of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of the formation and evolution of a Milky Way-size galaxy. In this study, {{we focus on the}} comparison of two particle-based hydrodynamics methods: the improved smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code Gadget, and the Lagrangian Meshless Finite-Mass (MFM) code GIZMO. All the simulations in this paper use the same initial conditions and physical models, which include physics of both dark matter and <b>baryons,</b> <b>star</b> formation, "energy-driven" outflow, metal-dependent cooling, stellar evolution and metal enrichment from supernovae. We find that both numerical schemes produce a late-type galaxy with extended gaseous and stellar disks. However, notable differences are present {{in a wide range of}} galaxy properties and their evolution, including star formation history, gas content, disk structure and kinematics. In particular, there is significant difference in gas properties and their evolution between the two simulations. Compared to GIZMO, Gadget simulation produces a larger fraction of cold, dense gas at high redshift which fuels rapid star formation and results in a higher stellar mass by 20 % and a lower gas fraction by 10 % at z = 0, and the resulting gas disk is smoother and more coherent in rotation due to damping of turbulent motion by the numerical viscosity in SPH, in contrast to the GIZMO simulation which shows more prominent spiral structure. Given its better convergence properties and lower computational cost, we argue that MFM method is a promising alternative to the widely used SPH in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.

We use a monte carlo code written by Shaun Cole to simulate the mass distribution and merger history of dark matter halos at various redshifts in a statistical way; we then set the initial conditions for baryons at redshift z= 20 and track their evolution to z= 6 coupling simple analytical prescriptions to the dark matter halo merger tree. Several other authors adopted this way of proceeding but we want to stress that {{we are trying to do}} something new: we focus our attention in the interplay between <b>baryons,</b> <b>stars,</b> light black hole seeds (10 ^ 2 Msun), heavy black hole seeds (10 ^ 5 Msun) and the radiative UV background that triggers structure formation. The problem is highly non trivial because we have to proceed in a self-consistent way: the strength of the radiative background selects different channels for structure formation inside the dark matter potential wells; the structures formed, on the other hand, determine the UV background at subsequent times. We focus on the prediction of the final central object mass, to see if it can reach the observed masses of 10 ^ 9 Msun and if it can match the empirical relation with the mass of the galaxy bulge mbulge/mBH= 10 ^ 3; we also try to obtain a first indication of the evolution of the X luminosity function of quasars with redshift, that can in principle be tested with future observations.

In the simulations, the potential in the central kiloparsec changes on sub-dynamical timescales over the redshift interval 4 > z> 2 as repeated, energetic feedback generates large underdense bubbles of expanding gas from centrally-concentrated bursts of star formation. The model demonstrates how fluctuations in the central potential irreversibly transfer energy into collisionless particles, thus generating a dark matter core. A supply of gas undergoing collapse and rapid expansion is therefore the essential ingredient. The framework, based on a novel impulsive approximation, breaks with the reliance on adiabatic approximations which are inappropriate in the rapidly-changing limit. It shows that both outflows and galactic foun-tains can give rise to cusp-flattening, even when only a few per cent of the <b>baryons</b> form <b>stars.</b> Dwarf galaxies maintain their core to the present time. The model suggests that constant den-sity dark matter cores will be generated in systems of a wide mass range if central starbursts or AGN phases are sufficiently frequent and energetic. ...|$|R
40|$|From X-ray {{observations}} of galaxy clusters one derives {{the mass of}} the intracluster medium along with its chemical composition. Optical/infrared observations are used to estimate {{the mass of the}} stellar components of galaxies, along with their chemical composition and age. This review shows that when combining all this information, several interesting inferences can be drawn, including: (1) galaxies lose more metals than they retain; (2) clusters and the general field have converted the same fraction of <b>baryons</b> into <b>stars,</b> hence the metallicity of the $z = 0 $ Universe as a whole has to be nearly the same we see in clusters, $sim$ 1 / 3 solar; (3) for the same reason, the thermal content of the intergalactic medium is expected to be nearly the same as the preheating energy of clusters; (4) a strong increase of the Type Ia supernova (SN) rate with lookback time is predicted if SNe Ia produce a major fraction of cosmic iron; (5) the global metallicity of the $zapprox 3 $ Universe was already $sim$ 1 / 10 solar; and (6) the Milky Way disk formed out of material that was pre-enriched to $sim$ 1 / 10 solar by the bulge stellar population...|$|R
40|$|Understanding how galaxies obtain <b>baryons,</b> their <b>stars</b> and gas, over cosmic time is {{traditionally}} approached {{in two different}} ways - theoretically and observationally. In general, observational approaches to galaxy formation include measuring basic galaxy properties, such as luminosities, stellar masses, rotation speeds, star formation rates and how these features evolve through time. Theoretically, cosmologically based models collate the physical effects driving galaxy assembly - mergers of galaxies, accretion of gas, star formation, and feedback, amongst others, to form predictions which are matched to galaxy observables. An alternative approach is to examine directly, in an observational way, the processes driving galaxy assembly, including the effects of feedback. This is a new `third way' towards understanding how galaxies are forming from gas accretion and mergers, and directly probes these effects instead of relying on simulations designed to reproduce observations. This empirical approach towards understanding galaxy formation, including the acquisition history of baryons, displays some significant differences with the latest galaxy formation models, in addition to directly demonstrating the mechanisms by which galaxies form most of their baryonic mass.

40|$|We {{investigate}} medium effects due to density-dependent magnetic {{moments of}} <b>baryons</b> on neutron <b>stars</b> under strong magnetic fields. If we allow the variation of anomalous magnetic moments (AMMs) of baryons in dense matter under strong magnetic fields, AMMs of nucleons are enhanced {{to be larger}} than those of hyperons. The enhancement naturally affects the chemical potentials of baryons to be large and leads to the increase of a proton fraction. Consequently, it causes the suppression of hyperons, resulting in the stiffness of the equation of state. Under the presumed strong magnetic fields, we evaluate relevant particles' population, the equation of state and the maximum masses of neutron stars by including density-dependent AMMs and compare them with those obtained from AMMs in free space...|$|R
40|$|We {{measure the}} {{contribution}} of galaxy disks to the overall gravitational potential of 30 nearly face-on intermediate-to-late-type spirals from the DiskMass Survey. The central vertical velocity dispersion of the disk stars (sigma(disk) (z,R= 0)) {{is related to the}} maximum rotation speed (V-max) as sigma(disk) (z,R= 0) similar to 0. 26 V(max), consistent with previous measurements for edge-on disk galaxies and a mean stellar velocity ellipsoid axial ratio alpha sigma(z) /sigma(R) = 0. 6. For reasonable values of disk oblateness, this relation implies these galaxy disks are submaximal. We find disks in our sample contribute only 15 %- 30 % of the dynamical mass within 2. 2 disk scale lengths (h(R)), with percentages increasing systematically with luminosity, rotation speed, and redder color. These trends indicate that the mass ratio of disk-to-total matter remains at or below 50 % at 2. 2 h(R) even for the most extreme, fast-rotating disks (V-max >= 300 km s(- 1)) of the reddest rest frame, face-on color (B - K similar to 4 mag), and highest luminosity (M-K <- 26. 5 mag). Therefore, spiral disks in general should be submaximal. Our results imply that the stellar mass-to-light ratio and hence the accounting of <b>baryons</b> in <b>stars</b> should be lowered by at least a factor of three...|$|R
40|$|Aims. We aim {{constrain}} the assembly history of clusters {{by studying the}} intracluster light (ICL) properties, estimating its contribution to the fraction of <b>baryons</b> in <b>stars,</b> f_∗, and understanding possible systematics or bias using different ICL detection techniques. Methods. We developed an automated method, GALtoICL, based on the software GALAPAGOS, to obtain a refined version of typical BCG+ICL maps. We applied this method to our test case MACS J 1206. 2 - 0847, a massive cluster located at z 0. 44, {{which is part of}} the CLASH sample. Using deep multiband Subaru images, we extracted the surface brightness (SB) profile of the BCG+ICL and studied the ICL morphology, color, and contribution to f_∗ out to R_(500). We repeated the same analysis using a different definition of the ICL, SBlimit method, i. e., a SB cut-off level, to compare the results. Results. The most peculiar feature of the ICL in MACS 1206 is its asymmetric radial distribution, with an excess in the SE direction and extending toward the second brightest cluster galaxy, which is a post starburst galaxy. This suggests an interaction between the BCG and this galaxy that dates back to τ ≤ 1. 5 Gyr. The BCG+ICL stellar content is 8...|$|R
