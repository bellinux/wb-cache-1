50|$|An {{inverter}} circuit outputs a voltage representing the opposite logic-level to its input. Its main {{function is to}} invert the input signal applied. If the applied input is low then the output becomes high and vice versa. Inverters can be constructed using a single NMOS transistor or a single PMOS transistor coupled with a resistor. Since this 'resistive-drain' approach uses only a single type of transistor, it can be fabricated at low cost. However, because current flows through the resistor {{in one of the}} two states, the resistive-drain configuration is disadvantaged for power consumption and processing speed. Alternatively, inverters can be constructed using two complementary transistors in a CMOS configuration. This configuration greatly reduces power consumption since one of the transistors is always off in both logic states. Processing speed can also be improved due to the relatively low resistance compared to the NMOS-only or PMOS-only type devices. Inverters can also be constructed with <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> (<b>BJT)</b> in either a resistor-transistor logic (RTL) or a transistor-transistor logic (TTL) configuration.|$|E

Then metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) structures with SiO 2 as dielectric have been fabricated. Capacitance voltage measurements show {{an increase in the}} negative fixed charges for all the implanted samples as a function of implantation induced damage.

40|$|Even {{though there}} had been {{extensive}} research in Switching Mode Power Amplifier design their applications at industry level are quite limited. This is because a Fully-Integrated Switching Mode Power Amplifier using conventional active devices such as <b>Bipolar</b> <b>Junction</b> <b>Transistors</b> (<b>BJT)</b> or Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) is challenging due to the inherent design challenges in the Switching Power Amplifier design. A Fully-Integrated Differential Class-F 2, 3 Power Amplifier design is explored for this Thesis research. This Power Amplifier has a maximum theoretical efficiency of 90. 7 % but this value is reduced because of the switching nature of the active device, parasitic effects associated with layout and the quality factor of the passive components used. Waveform shaping required for a Class-F Power Amplifier is done using the stray inductances within a non-ideal transformer instead of individual inductors. This techniques effective reduces the foot prints of two inductors for the tuning network design and make a Fully-Integrated solution more practical. M. S...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The bandgap voltage {{reference}} (BGR) circuit {{is an important}} component of Analog-to-Digital and Digital-to-Analog converters, which are broadly used in mixed-signal and radio-frequency systems. Most BGR use <b>bipolar</b> <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> (<b>BJT)</b> to easily reduce the temperature dependence, due to temperature coefficients, other common practice is the use of operational amplifiers (OP-AMP). The goal is to implement a BGR architecture without the use of an op-amp and using only one type of transistors, in this case, CMOS technology, and without the use of parasitic BJT. This must be accomplished without compromising the specified voltage variation requirements, BGR with 1 % variation. An all CMOS BGR without BJT and without Op-Amp is proposed and simulated using Xfab 0. 18 -µm process. The bandgap works with 1. 8 -V supply voltage with ± 10 % variation.
