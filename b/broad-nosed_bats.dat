5000|$|The little broad-nosed bat (Scotorepens greyii) is {{a species}} of vesper bat. It is found only in Australia, where it is {{widespread}} over the northern Western Australia, the Northern Territory and most of Queensland and New South Wales.Little <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> roost together in colonies of 2-20 bats. They roost in hollows in old,unused buildings and inside hollow fence posts. They have even been found roosting underneath the metal caps on top of telegraph posts.Little <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> feed on flying insects, such as mosquitoes. They hunt for insects by flying {{along the edges of}} creeks and over waterholes, catching their prey in flight. They drink by skimming over the surface of the water.In southern Australia little <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> mate before winter, with the females giving birth to twins in summer.Like many bats little <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> are vulnerable to loss of roost sites and feeding grounds by forestry activities, and when land is cleared for agriculture and housing.Like most native Australian animals, little <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> are protected.|$|E
50|$|Inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> are {{distributed}} widely throughout inland Australia, including arid and semi-arid regions. They {{are generally not}} distributed east of the Great Dividing Range (Churchill 2008, p. 155).|$|E
50|$|The inland broad-nosed bat is a moderate-sized {{species of}} microbat. It {{features}} a characteristic broad square-shaped muzzle {{when viewed from}} above that is formed by swollen, glandular pads (Reardon & Flavel 1991, p. 72). The fur colour of the species can vary from dark brown to a pale sand colour, with light grey-brown {{on the back and}} pale brown on the belly being most common (Churchill 2008, p. 155). This species along with other <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> have short slender ears, small eyes, a tail enclosed in the uropatagium membrane and only one upper incisor on each side (Parnaby 1999). Unique to male inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> are the numerous spines on the glans penis, with up to 22 spines on the head in two long rows (Churchill 2008, p. 155). Body measurements, especially forearm length, along with distribution are useful in identifying the species (Churchill 2008 p. 110). The species can also be identified by its short tragus of 4 mm (Parnaby 2008, p. 553). Male inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> tend to be slightly smaller than females (Reardon & Flavel 1991, p. 72).|$|E

50|$|The inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat</b> (Scotorepens balstoni), {{also known}} as the western <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat,</b> is a species of vesper bat. It is endemic to Australia and is {{widespread}} throughout the inland, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. This insectivorous microbat, measuring 12 cm in length, roosts in tree hollows during the day and forages over woodland and water at night.|$|R
50|$|<b>Broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> {{breed in}} the rainy season, giving birth between June and July in the {{northern}} parts of their range, {{and later in the}} year further south. They give birth to a single hairless young, weighing about 3 g, which first opens its eyes within a few hours of birth.|$|E
50|$|Research {{evidence}} indicates that Scotorepens balstoni may be a ‘composite of several distinct species’ creating {{the need for a}} ‘comprehensive taxonomic assessment’ of the species (Parnaby 2008, p. 552). Due to similarities in appearance Scotorepens balstoni is most likely {{to be confused with the}} other species of small <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> (Scotorepens): S. greyii, S. orion, S. sanborni and S. sp. (Parnaby 1999, p. 4; Richards & Hall 2012, p. 169).|$|E
50|$|Inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> {{prefer to}} roost in tree hollows, {{in groups of}} up to 45 {{individuals}} (Churchill 2008, p. 155). Roosting also occurs in the roofs of buildings, under metal caps of power poles and in water pipes (Churchill 2008, p. 155). They often roost horizontally (Parnaby 2008, p. 552). The species {{has been known to}} share roosts with colonies of south-eastern freetail bats (Mormopterus sp.) (Australian Museum 2009; Churchill 2008, p. 155).|$|E

50|$|Foraging {{locations}} in the drier distribution areas appear to depend on nearness to water points and roosting sites (Williams & Dickman 2004, p. 213). In arid areas inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> possibly obtain water from the insects eaten and further conserve water by producing concentrated urine in specialized kidneys (Williams & Dickman 2004, p. 205). In semi-arid areas foraging is concentrated around water sources with drinking occurring during flight (Reardon & Flavel 1991, p. 72). Similar to other arid zone mammals it is likely, especially in southern distribution areas, that the inland broad-nosed bat is able to enter into prolonged periods of torpor, reducing energy and water requirements (Geiser 2004, p. 130). Another arid and semi-arid adaption {{is the ability to}} tolerate high body temperatures (Bondarenco, Körtner & Geiser 2014, p. 684).|$|E
50|$|In Western Australia {{distribution}} {{covers the}} northern wheatbelt, the south-western interzone, the Murchison region, the Gibson desert and the Great Victoria desert (Bullen & Dunlop 2012, p. 277). In the Western Australian rangelands the species shows preference for Mulga woodland, while also choosing to inhabit Salmon Gum/Gimlet and York Gum woodlands (Bullen & Dunlop 2012, p. 282). In the semi-arid Mallee region of north-western Victoria inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> show {{a preference for}} open woodland and dryland woodland habitats (Lumsden & Bennett 1995). Other known occurrences in semi-arid regions in New South Wales are at Willundra Lakes and Kinchega National Park, along with Dangalli in South Australia (Lumsden & Bennett 1995, p. 233). In South Australia distribution in arid areas indicates a habitat preference for river red gums following surface drainage systems (Reardon & Flavel 1991, p. 72).|$|E
50|$|Inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> are {{a common}} species but are {{decreasing}} in population (Pennay & Lumsden 2008). The ‘wide distribution, large population and occurrence {{in a number of}} protected areas’ places this species within the IUCN Red List category of least concern (Pennay & Lumsden 2008). Further research is needed to identify the specific threats to this species (Pennay & Lumsden 2008). Likely threats to roosting sties and feeding grounds include agricultural and forestry activity, clearing for housing, modified fire regimes that eliminate trees with hollows and local removal of access to roosting sites (Parnaby 2008, p. 552). Researchers or wildlife rescuers should be aware that the species are known to be aggressive and their strong jaws deliver a painful bite (Reardon & Flavel 1991, p. 73). Due to their aggressive nature it is also advisable to carry and house them separately to other species (Kemper & Reardon 2014).|$|E

5000|$|... === Diet and {{foraging}} === Inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> {{are described}} as air-superiority insectivores (Bullen & McKenzie 2008, p. 283). In northern distribution areas they are known to eat cockroaches, termites, crickets, cicadas, bugs, beetles, flies, moths and ants (Churchill 2008, p. 156). In Victoria their diet consists mostly of beetles, ants, bugs, moths, flies and grasshoppers (Churchill 2008, p. 156). They start foraging earlier than most other species, beginning usually just on dusk (Churchill 2008, p. 156). Foraging is achieved using echolocation whilst in continuous flight, keeping within 15 metres of the ground, with rapid diversions to pursue prey (Churchill 2008, p. 156). Foraging mainly occurs between trees, not going above the tree canopy, {{as well as at}} the edges of forests venturing into open areas (Churchill 2008, p. 156). Speeds during flight have been measured between 12-21 km/h (Churchill 2008, p. 156). Flight efficiency is a result of the species having a streamlined head shape, silky fur texture and small manoeuvre-enhancing shaped ears (Bullen & McKenzie 2008 p. 285).|$|E

5000|$|The Choco <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat</b> (Platyrrhinus chocoensis) is {{a species}} of bat in the family Phyllostomidae.
