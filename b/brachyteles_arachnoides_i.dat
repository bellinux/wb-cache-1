40|$|ABSTRACT: Sequential {{exchanges of}} vocalizations (staccatos and neighs) emitted by Northern Muriquis <b>Brachyteles</b> <b>arachnoides</b> hypoxanthus were {{recorded}} at the Biological Station of Caratinga, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Staccatos and neighs containing {{larger proportion of}} short elements were preferentially produced during short-range exchanges; neighs, produced by {{a larger number of}} participants, were typical of long-range exchanges. Staccatos emitted by animals feeding in a dispersed manner contained a larger proportion of tonal elements than those emitted by muriquis feeding in a cohesive manner. Sequential exchanges seem thus to be constituted by two inter-related subsystems of calls that aid muriquis to coordinate intragroup spacing, despite the poor visibility of the habitat...|$|R

40|$|Lianas {{as a food}} {{resource}} for brown howlers (Alouatta guariba) and southern muriquis (<b>Brachyteles</b> <b>arachnoides)</b> in a forest fragment. — Lianas, woody vines, are abundant and diverse in tropical forests, but their relative contribution {{as a source of}} food for herbivores has been neglected. I compared feeding rates on lianas and trees of two sympatric primates, A. guariba and B. arachnoides, in Southeastern Brazil. Availability of liana foods was gathered in parallel with primate behavioral data collection. Liana represented 33. 9 % and 27. 3 % of food sources for A. guariba and B. arachnoides, respectively. Foods coming from trees, rather than from lianas, were significantly more consumed by B. arachnoides. However, both species took advantage of the continuously renewable and ephemeral food resources provided by liana. Availability of liana flowers correlated positively with A. guariba feeding proportions. The nutritional supply provided by lianas is apparently beneficial, or at least unharmful, but experiments comparing primate choices in forests with different liana abundances will help to shed light on their possible negative effect on communities...|$|R
40|$|We applied {{complementary}} survey techniques {{to obtain a}} baseline species list of mid and large bodied mammals in Núcleo Caraguatatuba, Serra do Mar State park, Brazil. Between May and September 2011 we surveyed the community of mid and large bodied mammals using diurnal line transect census (212. 4 km), camera-traps (223. 2 camera-trap days) and track-stations (478 track-station days). A total of 18 species were recorded from 14 families in eight orders.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of Neotropical Primates (NP) is permeated by {{factors associated with}} the pattern of diversification and the biogeography of the major lineages. These questions can be better understood by providing a robust estimate of the chronological scenario of NP evolution, a reason why molecular dating methods have been widely applied. One aspect of especial interest is the timing of diversification of the major NP lineages (pitheciids, atelids and cebids), which may have resulted from rapid episodes of adaptive radiation, a question that requires NP divergence time estimates with accurate statistical certainty. In this study, we evaluated the primate timescale focused on the age of nodes of NP radiation. We investigated the performance of complete primate mitochondrial genomes as traditional molecular markers of primate evolution and further including original mitochondrial data from the endangered muriqui, <b>Brachyteles</b> <b>arachnoides</b> (Accession No. JX 262672). Comparisons of the age estimates at NP nodes based on mitochondrial genomes with those obtained from a nuclear supermatrix showed similar degrees of uncertainty. Further molecular data and more informative calibration priors are required for a more precise understanding of the early NP diversification...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the intra- and {{interspecific}} variability of the 14 / 15 association in Platyrrhini, we analyzed 15 species from 13 genera, including species {{that had not been}} described yet. The DNA libraries of human chromosomes 14 and 15 were hybridized to metaphases of Alouatta guariba clamitans, A. caraya, A. sara, Ateles paniscus chamek, Lagothrix lagothricha, <b>Brachyteles</b> <b>arachnoides,</b> Saguinus midas midas, Leontopithecus chrysomelas, Callimico goeldii, Callithrix sp., Cebus apella, Aotus nigriceps, Cacajao melanocephalus, Chiropotes satanas and Callicebus caligatus. The 14 / 15 hybridization pattern was present in 13 species, but not in Alouatta sara that showed a 14 / 15 / 14 pattern and Aotus nigriceps that showed a 15 / 14 / 15 / 14 pattern. In the majority of the species, the HSA 14 homologue retained synteny for the entire chromosome, whereas the HSA 15 homologue displayed fragmented segments. Within primates, the New World monkeys represent the taxon with the highest variability in chromosome number (2 n = 16 to 62). The presence of the HSA 14 / 15 association in all species and subspecies studied herein confirms that this association is the ancestral condition for platyrrhines and that this association has been retained in most platyrrhines, despite the occurrence of extensive inter- and intrachromosomal rearrangements in this infraorder of Primates...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aimed {{to compare the}} plant food diet of woolly spider monkeys (<b>Brachyteles</b> <b>arachnoides)</b> inhabiting Intervales State Park in São Paulo, Brazil, with {{medicinal}} plant species used by humans in the surrounding areas of the park. The diet {{of a group of}} woolly spider monkeys living in an Atlantic forest area was recorded during 43 months of fieldwork. Fifty-three species (87 food items) were recorded. Plant specimens were collected and identified at the University of São Paulo and the Botanical Institute of São Paulo State. Using semi-structured interviews, ethnomedicinal data were also collected from four preselected respondents regarding the human therapeutic value of these plants. The study showed that 24. 5 % (13 / 53) of these species are used by residents around the park for medicinal purposes. Of these thirteen, seven species also have validated pharmacological properties, and three are utilized by local residents for similar medicinal purposes. Overlap in the plant food/medicinal diet of woolly spider monkey populations elsewhere were also noted, suggesting potential overlap in their medicinal value for humans and primates. The similarities between the ingestion of plants by primates and their medicinal use by humans provide a bio-rational for the search of bioactive plants in the primate diet. Further detailed investigation of their pharmacological and phytochemical value is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Background: Functional {{redundancy}} {{has been}} debated largely in ecology and conservation, yet we lack detailed empirical {{studies on the}} roles of functionally similar species in ecosystem function. Large bodied frugivores may disperse similar plant species and have strong impact on plant recruitment in tropical forests. The two largest frugivores in the neotropics, tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) and muriquis (<b>Brachyteles</b> <b>arachnoides)</b> are potential candidates for functional redundancy on seed dispersal effectiveness. Here we provide {{a comparison of the}} quantitative, qualitative and spatial effects on seed dispersal by these megafrugivores in a continuous Brazilian Atlantic forest. Methodology/Principal Findings: We found a low overlap of plant species dispersed by both muriquis and tapirs. A group of 35 muriquis occupied an area of 850 ha and dispersed 5 times more plant species, and 13 times more seeds than 22 tapirs living in the same area. Muriquis dispersed 2. 4 times more seeds in any random position than tapirs. This can be explained mainly because seed deposition by muriquis leaves less empty space than tapirs. However, tapirs are able to disperse larger seeds than muriquis and move them into sites not reached by primates, such as large forest gaps, open areas and fragments nearby. Based on published information we found 302 plant species that are dispersed by {{at least one of these}} megafrugivores in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Conclusions/Significance: Our study showed that both megafrugivores play complementary rather than redundant roles a...|$|R
40|$|The {{data set}} {{provided}} here includes 8, 320 frugivory interactions (records of pairwise interactions between plant and frugivore species) {{reported for the}} Atlantic Forest. The data set includes interactions between 331 vertebrate species (232 birds, 90 mammals, 5 fishes, 1 amphibian, and 3 reptiles) and 788 plant species. We also present information on traits {{directly related to the}} frugivory process (endozoochory), such as the size of fruits and seeds and the body mass and gape size of frugivores. Data were extracted from 166 published and unpublished sources spanning from 1961 to 2016. While this is probably the most comprehensive data set available for a tropical ecosystem, it is arguably taxonomically and geographically biased. The plant families better represented are Melastomataceae, Myrtaceae, Moraceae, Urticaceae, and Solanaceae. Myrsine coriacea, Alchornea glandulosa, Cecropia pachystachya, and Trema micrantha are the plant species with the most animal dispersers (83, 76, 76, and 74 species, respectively). Among the animal taxa, the highest number of interactions is reported for birds (3, 883) followed by mammals (1, 315). The woolly spider monkey or muriqui, <b>Brachyteles</b> <b>arachnoides,</b> and Rufous-bellied Thrush, Turdus rufiventris, are the frugivores with the most diverse fruit diets (137 and 121 plants species, respectively). The most important general patterns that we note are that larger seeded plant species (> 12 mm) are mainly eaten by terrestrial mammals (rodents, ungulates, primates, and carnivores) and that birds are the main consumers of fruits with a high concentration of lipids. Our data set is geographically biased, with most interactions recorded for the southeast Atlantic Forest. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the first {{evidence}} of intra-community coalitionary lethal aggression in muriquis (Brachyteles). The event occurred in southern muriquis (<b>Brachyteles</b> <b>arachnoides)</b> during a long-term study (> 15 years) of two social groups inhabiting mostly pristine Atlantic forest habitat in the Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho, southern Sa˜o Paulo State, Brazil. The attack took place deep in the core area of the Group Caeteˆ home range. Tense agonistic behaviors and vocalizations preceded the lethal coalitionary attack, and the tension increased over a 36 – 48 hr period. One adult female and two unidentified individuals also {{took part in a}} coalition led by six adult males. The members of the coalition collectively approached, embraced, immobilized and repeatedly bit the entire body of an adult male, resulting in severe bleeding injuries and the victim’s death in less than 1 hr after the attack commenced. Combined ecological, behavioral and spatial data related to the event indicate that this was an intra-community attack and suggest social tensions related to mating competition as the proximate trigger of the coalitionary killing. The attack resembled those reported for chimpanzees, with clear numeric superiority and a low risk of injury to aggressors, resulting in the death of a lone conspecific victim. This observation (n= 1) is suggestive of a capacity for escalated aggression in muriquis and reinforces arguments for the potential adaptive significance of intra-community aggression in male philopatric societies, as reported for spider monkeys and chimpanzees. These characteristics challenge the view of the muriquis as a peaceful primate and support the general hypothesis that imbalances of power contribute to intra-specific killing in primates, such as chimpanzees and humans...|$|R
40|$|Human {{interventions}} in natural environments {{are the main}} cause of biodiversity loss worldwide. The situation is not different in southern Brazil, home of five primate species. Although some earlier studies exist, studies on the primates of this region began to be consistently carried out in the 1980 s and have continued since then. In addition t o important initiatives to study and protect the highly endangered Leontopithecus caissara Lorrini & Persson, 1990 and <b>Brachyteles</b> <b>arachnoides</b> E. Geoffroy, 1806, other species, including locally threatened ones, have been the focus of research, management, and protection initiatives. Since 1993, the urban monkeys program (PMU, Programa Macacos Urbanos) has surveyed the distribution and assessed threats to populations of Alouatta guariba clamitans (Cabrera, 1940) in Porto Alegre and vicinity. PMU has developed conservation strategies on four fronts: (1) scientific research on biology and ecology, providing basic knowledge to support all other activities of the group; (2) conservation education, which emphasizes educational presentations and long-term projects in schools near howler populations, based on the flagship species approach; (3) management, analyzing conflicts involving howlers and human communities, focusing on mitigating these problems and on appropriate relocation of injured or at-risk individuals; and finally, (4) Public Policies aimed at reducing and/or preventing the impact of urban expansion, contributing to create protected areas and to strengthen environmental laws. These different approaches have contributed to protect howler monkey populations over the short term, indicating that working collectively and acting on diversified and interrelated fronts are essential to achieve conservation goals. The synergistic results of these approaches and their relationship to the prospects for primatology in southern Brazil are presented in this review...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the use of}} stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in animal tissue for indicating aspects of species behavioral strategy. We analyzed hair from individuals representing four species of New World monkeys (Alouatta palliata, the mantled howler; Ateles geoffroyi, the spider monkey; Cebus capucinus, the capuchin; and <b>Brachyteles</b> <b>arachnoides,</b> the woolly-spider monkey or muriqui) for delta 13 C and delta 15 N using previously developed methods. There are {{no significant differences in}} either carbon or nitrogen ratios between sexes, sampling year, or year of analysis. Seasonal differences in delta 13 C reached a low level of significance but do not affect general patterns. Variation within species was similar to that recorded previously within single individuals. The omega 13 C data show a bimodal distribution with significant difference between the means. The two monkey populations living in an evergreen forest were similar to each other and different from the other two monkey populations that inhabited dry, deciduous forests. This bimodal distribution is independent of any particular species' diet and reflects the level of leaf cover in the two types of forest. The delta 15 N data display three significantly different modes. The omnivorous capuchins were most positive reflecting a trophic level offset. The spider monkeys and the muriquis were similar to one another and significantly more positive than the howlers. This distribution among totally herbivorous species correlates with the ingestion of legumes by the howler monkey population. In combination, these data indicate that museum-curated primate material can be analyzed to yield information on forest cover and diet in populations and species lacking behavioral data...|$|R
40|$|Time is an {{important}} currency for primate energetics, reproduction, and survival. Here, we describe the activity budgets {{of a group of}} southern muriquis (<b>Brachyteles</b> <b>arachnoides)</b> inhabiting the largest continuous fragment of Brazilian Atlantic Forest (210, 000 ha) in Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho (24 ° 44 ´– 15 ´S, 47 ´ 46 – 10 W), in the southern region of São Paulo State. We collected instantaneous scan sampling data to assess monthly, seasonal, and between-year differences in time allocation for the different activities for 2 complete, nonconsecutive years— 1995 and 2002 —and compare these with measures of food availability. Over the 2 yr, the group rested on average for 48 %, fed for 28 %, traveled for 22. 5 %, and socialized for 1. 5 % of daylight hours. On a monthly basis, resting correlated negatively with traveling in 1995, and strongly negatively correlated with feeding for both years. Feeding correlated negatively with traveling in 2002, with significantly more time spent traveling during periods of higher young leaf availability. Season was a major influence on activity: the group rested more during the hotter, rainy austral summer season, whereas feeding occurred more frequently in the cooler, drier winter season. We found no consistent associations between food availability and the time that southern muriquis spent in most activities. We suggest that these southern muriquis, like many other large-bodied and atelin primates, minimize energy expenditure while maximizing energy intake, which may be associated with their ability to be folivorous when their preferred fruit foods are less available. They thus adopt a flexible energetic strategy for coping with variable climatic conditions rather than being constrained by food availability...|$|R
