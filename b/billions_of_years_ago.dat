5|$|Oberon's {{accretion}} probably {{lasted for}} several thousand years. The impacts that accompanied accretion caused heating of the moon's outer layer. The maximum temperature of around 230K was reached at {{the depth of}} about 60km. After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Oberon heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks. The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong extensional stresses in the moon's crust leading to cracking.

Life probably started on earth around three and a half <b>billion</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and a genetic memory emerged early, based on an extraordinarily stable molecule, the DNA double helix, bearing a genetic code identical for all living organisms, from bacteria to men.

For the last 30, 000 years, our biological constitution has not changed: a hypertrophic cortical brain, a larynx to speak and a hand to manipulate. But for the last 10, 000 years, another memory has emerged, which make our species quite different from the others: this is the cultural memory which transmits knowledge and societal organisation from generation to genera...|$|R
30|$|Owing to {{the above}} notion, Demirbas [90] {{described}} that costs of biofuel production vary widely and depend on scale of production, conversion process and regional attributes regarding nature and supply of feedstock. In the near future, algae {{will prove to be}} most important biofuel source. Microalgae represent best source of renewable biodiesel with potential of meeting global demands for transport fuels. The notion of regional influence on cost of biofuel production indicated above favors for designing suitable microalgal cultivation facilities with concomitant biological treatment effluents/urban-influenced streams/rivers water in Pakistan. Demirbas [90] commented rightly that the earth atmosphere was filled with CO 2 <b>billion</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> when no life on earth was recordable. Cyanobacteria and algae probably were the first to imprint their signatures on the earth. These pioneering photosynthetic organisms consumed up the atmospheric CO 2 and started to replace it with O 2. Resultantly, aerobic life evolved on earth. It appears that threat of global warming will also be resolved once again by the smallest photosynthetic organisms.|$|R
5|$|Umbriel's {{accretion}} probably {{lasted for}} several thousand years. The impacts that accompanied accretion caused heating of the moon's outer layer.

25|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, cosmologists had {{developed}} two different theories to explain the creation of the universe.

25|$|Although quasars appear faint {{when viewed}} from Earth, they are visible from extreme distances, being the most {{luminous}} objects in the known universe. The brightest quasar in the sky is 3C273 in the constellation of Virgo. It has an average apparent magnitude of 12.8 (bright enough to be seen through a medium-size amateur telescope), but it has an absolute magnitude of −26.7. From {{a distance of about}} 33 light-years, this object would shine in the sky about as brightly as our sun. This quasar's luminosity is, therefore, about 4 trillion (4 × 1012) times that of the Sun, or about 100 times that of the total light of giant galaxies like the Milky Way. This assumes the quasar is radiating energy in all directions, but the active galactic nucleus is believed to be radiating preferentially in the direction of its jet. In a universe containing hundreds of billions of galaxies, most of which had active nuclei <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> but only seen today, it is statistically certain that thousands of energy jets should be pointed toward the Earth, some more directly than others. In many cases {{it is likely that the}} brighter the quasar, the more directly its jet is aimed at the Earth.|$|E

25|$|The Star Sapphires {{are first}} {{mentioned}} {{in the context of}} a group during a conversation between Carol Ferris and Hal Jordan immediately after Ferris has just recovered from having been possessed by the Star Sapphire stone during Mystery of the Star Sapphire. Ferris explains that while under the possession of the stone, she learned a number of things about its history and capabilities. She says that it told her that <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> when the Guardians of the Universe decided to form the Green Lantern Corps, a tribe of women left Oa because they did not agree with the Guardians' belief in living a life without emotion. They said they would continue on their own existence living with emotions, starting with love. They searched the universe for billions of years for the thing the Guardians feared, and eventually found it on a planet called Zamaron. They learned of love from the first Star Sapphire gem, which was discovered locked between the embrace of two crystallized skeletons inside a cave. She explains to him that despite the fact that he had been able to defeat the various incarnations of the Star Sapphire he'd encountered up until then, other Green Lanterns had not been as fortunate. She describes another Star Sapphire falling in love with a Green Lantern and encasing his world in violet crystal so that the two could be together forever. She also mentions that the Star Sapphire gem is like the green power rings used by Green Lanterns and the yellow power rings used by Sinestro Corps members.|$|E

500|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> Venus's atmosphere was much more like Earth's than it is now, and {{that there may have}} been substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface, but after a period of 600 million to several billion years, a runaway greenhouse effect was caused by the evaporation of that original water, which generated a critical level of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere. Although the surface conditions on Venus are no longer hospitable to any Earthlike life that may have formed before this event, there is speculation on the possibility that life exists in the [...] upper cloud layers of Venus, [...] up from the surface, where the temperature ranges between [...] but the environment is acidic.|$|E
500|$|Venus has {{no natural}} satellites.

Alex Alemi's and David Stevenson's 2006 study of models of the early Solar System at the California Institute of Technology shows Venus likely {{had at least one}} moon created by a huge impact event <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> About 10millionyears later, according to the study, another impact reversed the planet's spin direction and caused the Venusian moon gradually to spiral inward until it collided with Venus. If later impacts created moons, these were removed in the same way. An alternative explanation for the lack of satellites is the effect of strong solar tides, which can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets.|$|E
500|$|The Moon used {{to rotate}} {{at a faster}} rate, but early in its history, its {{rotation}} slowed and became tidally locked in this orientation {{as a result of}} frictional effects associated with tidal deformations caused by Earth. With time, the energy of rotation of the Moon on its axis was dissipated as heat, until there was no rotation of the Moon relative to the Earth. The side of the Moon that faces Earth is called the near side, and the opposite the far side. The far side is often inaccurately called the [...] "dark side", but it is in fact illuminated as often as the near side: once per lunar day, during the new moon phase we observe on Earth when the near side is dark. In 2016, planetary scientists, using data collected on the much earlier Nasa Lunar Prospector mission, found two hydrogen-rich areas {{on opposite sides of the}} Moon, probably in the form of water ice.
