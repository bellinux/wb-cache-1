5|$|The {{official}} conclusions {{were still}} <b>being</b> <b>debated</b> by academics and conspiracy theorists more than 50 {{years after the}} assassination. One such theorist, Texas author Jim Marrs, wrote that most researchers were ready to accept Lovelady as the man in Altgens' photograph.

5|$|This partly {{resulted}} from the arrest for espionage of British physicist Alan Nunn May, who {{had worked in the}} Montreal Laboratory, in February 1946, while the legislation was <b>being</b> <b>debated.</b> It was but {{the first of a series}} of spy scandals. The arrest of Klaus Fuchs in January 1950, and the June 1951 defection of Donald Maclean, who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, left Americans with a distrust of British security arrangements. The remaining British scientists working in the United States were denied access to papers that they had written just days before.|$|E
5|$|When {{the media}} asked King Juan Carlos {{if he would}} sign the bill that was <b>being</b> <b>debated</b> in the Cortes Generales, he {{answered}} {{that he was the}} King of Spain, not of Belgiuma reference to King Baudouin of Belgium, who refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion. For the King to withhold his royal assent, it would effect a veto of the legislation. However, the King gave his royal assent to Law 13/2005 on 1 July 2005, and the law was gazetted in the Boletín Oficial del Estado on 2 July, and came into effect on 3 July. The King received criticism by Carlist and other far right conservatives for signing the legislation.|$|E

5|$|Even as {{the act was}} <b>being</b> <b>debated,</b> {{settlers}} on {{both sides}} of the slavery issue poured into the territories so as to secure the outcome they wanted in the voting. The passage of the act resulted in so much violence between groups that the territory became known as Bleeding Kansas. Thousands of pro-slavery Border Ruffians came across from Missouri to vote in the territorial elections although they were not resident in Kansas, giving that element the victory. Pierce supported the outcome despite the irregularities. When Free-Staters set up a shadow government, and drafted the Topeka Constitution, Pierce called their work an act of rebellion. The president continued to recognize the pro-slavery legislature, which was dominated by Democrats, even after a Congressional investigative committee found its election to have been illegitimate. He dispatched federal troops to break up a meeting of the Topeka government.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{of other}} leagues {{took note of}} the {{financial}} boon that followed SEC expansion to twelve teams. Atlantic Coast Conference representatives began discussing expansion to twelve schools {{in the first years}} of the new century, who began publicly pursuing the possibility of expansion anew in 2003. On May 13, 2003, representatives voted in favor of extending invitations to three schools. The only certain school was the University of Miami, while the other two spots were still <b>being</b> <b>debated.</b> Initially, the league favored admitting Miami, Syracuse University, and Boston College. After a month of debate, however, the ACC elected to extend formal invitations to Miami, Boston College, and Virginia Tech, which joined after initially being overlooked. This came years after these schools were considered for ACC membership in the early 1990s but nothing had ever came to fruition. Pittsburgh and Syracuse would also eventually join the ACC after rejections in 1990 and 2003, becoming members in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum was}} opened by The King at the Crystal Palace on 9 June 1920. During the opening ceremony, Sir Alfred Mond {{addressed}} the King {{on behalf of}} the committee, saying that 'it was hoped to make the museum so complete that every one {{who took part in the}} war, however obscurely, would find therein an example or illustration of the sacrifice he or she made' and that the museum 'was not a monument of military glory, but a record of toil and sacrifice'. Shortly afterwards the Imperial War Museum Act 1920 was passed and established a Board of Trustees to oversee the governance of the museum. To reflect the museum's Imperial remit the board included appointees of the governments of India, South Africa, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. While the Act was <b>being</b> <b>debated,</b> some Parliamentarians felt that the museum would perpetuate an undesirable war spirit and Commander Joseph Kenworthy MP said that he would 'refuse to vote a penny of public money to commemorate such suicidal madness of civilisation as that which was shown in the late War'. On the August Bank Holiday 1920, the first public holiday since the museum's opening, 94,179 visitors were received, and by November 1921, 2,290,719 had visited the museum.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still <b>being</b> <b>debated.</b> In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E

40|$|The major {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to examine the influence that valuers and valuations have on the workings of the commercial property investment market in the UK. The research described involved interviews with 30 fund managers and owners and their property advisors.

The research has important implications for the type of property research which assumes that valuations and prices are independent of one another, an example <b>being</b> <b>debates</b> over valuation accuracy. The research also reveals differences in the way that valuers amend frequently reviewed periodic valuations and a worrying increase in the concentration o...|$|R

Appointments to the Court were expected and unsurprising. The most senior Justices on the Court of Appeal were appointed to the new Court.|$|E
