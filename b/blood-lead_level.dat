50|$|Lead {{exposure}} {{has been}} proven to have significant effects on the intellectual development of a child. In a long-term study done by Baghurst et al. 1992, children who grew up next to a lead-smelting plant had significantly lower intelligence test scores, negatively correlated with their <b>blood-lead</b> <b>level</b> exposure. Even though lead levels have been reduced in our environment, some areas in the United States, particularly inner cities, are still at risk for exposing their children.|$|E
5000|$|Lead {{exposure}} {{across the}} U.S. has fallen dramatically since the 1980s, but no <b>blood-lead</b> <b>level</b> is considered completely safe. Children under age five, and especially infants and unborn children, bear {{the greatest risk}} of deleterious and irreversible health outcomes. From 2012 to 2016, the CDC set a [...] "reference level" [...] of 5 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL), in order to target for case management the 2.5% of young American children with the highest blood-lead levels. At 45 µg/dL, chelation therapy is considered. Among the many ways lead can enter a modern American's bloodstream is through lead plumbing. Acidic water {{makes it easier for}} the lead found in pipes, leaded solder, and brass faucets to dissolve and to enter a home's drinking water. Therefore, public water treatment systems are legally required to use control measures to make water less acidic. Plumbing that contains lead is often found in buildings constructed in the 1980s and earlier.|$|E
40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Children younger than 72 months are most at risk of en-vironmental exposure to lead from ingestion through normal mouthing behavior. Young children are more vulnerable than adults to the deleterious effects of lead poisoning because lead is absorbed more readily in a child’s gastrointestinal tract [1]. Further, the developing nervous system of young children is more vulnerable to the toxic effects of lead [1]. Even at low levels, lead exposure can have a devastating effect on the growth and development of young children. Evidence suggests blood-lead concentrations ≤ 5 μg/dL are associated with cognitive deficits [2, 3]. From 1991 to 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined an elevated <b>blood-lead</b> <b>level</b> (EBLL) as ≥ 10 μg/dL. However, evidence shows that EBLLs < 10 μg/dL can adversely affect the IQ scores of children [4, 5]...|$|E

40|$|Lead {{remains one}} of the most {{hazardous}} toxins in our environment. Because the toxic effects of lead are most prominent during early development, it is important to develop a suitable biomarker for lead exposure during the pre- and neonatal periods. In the present study, the spatial distribution of lead was measured in the enamel and dentine of ten human primary teeth using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The neonatal line, visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy, was used to demarcate the pre- and postnatal regions of the sample teeth. Lead levels in pre- and postnatally formed enamel and dentine were compared to <b>blood-lead</b> <b>levels</b> measured at birth and one year of age for four of these participants. Mean dentine-lead levels ranged from 0. 17 ± 0. 02 to 5. 60 ± 1. 79 μg/g, and mean enamel-lead levels ranged from 0. 04 ± 0. 01 to 1. 47 ± 0. 20 μg/g. The results of this preliminary study showed that the spatial distribution of lead in dentine reflected the <b>blood-lead</b> <b>levels.</b> The present study demonstrates a methodology where the spatial distribution of lead in the dentine of human primary teeth may be used to obtain temporal information of environmental lead exposure during the pre- and neonatal periods. 8 page(s...|$|R

Some studies have {{demonstrated}} that cigarette smokingresults in <b>blood-lead</b> <b>levels</b> elevation as well as decreased blood ascorbic acid. This study hasperformed on this issue in lead exposed welder workers. Method:Adescriptive cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate associations of smokinghabit with blood lead, hemoglobin and plasma ascorbic acid levels in 32 welders. All the casesused to work in a car factory in Tehran suburb as welders 8 hours a day. They were divided intothree groups based on blood lead level quartiles. The blood lead levels were determined by 8003 NAIOSH method and blood ascorbic acid levelwas determined by Lowery method. Results were compared (based on mean values) usingindependent sample t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods. Results: Results indicated that the blood lead levels in those who smoke 7 + cigarettes per day wassignificantly higher than those who smoke < 7 cigarettes per day (p< 0. 05) or no smoking group(p< 0. 001). The hemoglobin concentrations in 7 + group was significantly lower than of the < 7 (p< 0. 01) and no smoking (p< 0. 05) groups.

5000|$|On September 24, 2015, Hurley Medical Center in Flint {{released}} a study, led by Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the {{program director for}} pediatric residency at Hurley Children's Hospital, confirming {{that the proportion of}} infants and children with elevated levels of lead in their blood had nearly doubled since the city switched from the Detroit water system to using the Flint River as its water source. Using hospital records, Hanna-Attisha found that a steep rise in <b>blood-lead</b> <b>levels</b> corresponded to the city's switch in water sources. The study was initially dismissed by Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) spokesman Brad Wurfel, who repeated a familiar refrain: [...] "Repeated testing indicated the water tested within acceptable levels."

Exploiting the distinct geographical variation in early childhood lead exposure induced by the regulations together with micro data on all children in nine birth cohorts I show that reduced lead exposure early in life improves scholastic performance, cognitive ability, and labor market outcomes among young adults. At the relatively low levels of exposure considered, the analysis reveals a nonlinear relationship between local air lead levels in early childhood and adult outcomes, indicating {{the existence of a}} threshold below which further reductions no longer improve adult outcomes.

Michigan Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program data agree an increase occurred, suggesting an increase from 2.2% of children (May 2013 - April 2014) to 3.0% (May 2014 - April 2015). Hanna-Attisha's data were taken from hospital laboratory records for children {{less than five years}} old. Hanna-Attisha's sample numbers were large, both for the pre-switch and post-switch time periods and for Flint children (1,473) and for children not exposed to Flint water (2,202). Elevated lead levels in children's blood was shown to be correlated with elevated lead levels in Flint water. Because lead screening is not completed for all children, such data may be skewed toward higher-risk children and thus overestimate lead exposure, especially in non-high-risk areas.|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} chapter, I {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the Residential Lead Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act. Enacted in 1996, the lead hazard disclosure policy requires sellers and landlords to disclose known lead-based paint hazards to potential buyers or renters. Employing a difference-in-differences approach, I find evidence that the law prompted some families with children to reallocate toward homes without significant lead risks, increased lead mitigation in rental properties, and reduced <b>blood-lead</b> <b>levels</b> among children in rental properties. However, because white families appear to be more responsive to information disclosure than other groups, the information disclosure law might exacerbate racial disparities in lead exposure. In the second chapter, I estimate the spatio-temporal dynamics between wildfire and infant birthweight. Exposure to wildfire smoke is determined using the latitude and longitude coordinates of each infant's home address and a fine-scaled, spatial dataset of wildfire smoke plumes re-constructed in GIS from satellite images of the landscape.

50|$|The Flint {{drinking}} water contamination issue started in April 2014 when Flint changed its water source from treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department water (sourced from Lake Huron and the Detroit River) to the Flint River.

The Flint River water that was treated improperly caused lead from aging pipes to leach into the water supply, leading to extremely elevated levels of the heavy metal neurotoxin. In Flint, between 6,000 and 12,000 children have been exposed to {{drinking water}} with high levels of lead and they may experience a range of serious health problems. Due to the change in water source, the percentage of Flint children with elevated <b>blood-lead</b> <b>levels</b> may have risen from about 2.5% in 2013 to as much as 5% in 2015.

50|$|Mining, mineral {{processing}} and smelting {{activities in the}} area have produced gold, silver, lead and zinc for more than 130 years. Wastes generated during the mining and ore processing activities contained metals such as arsenic and lead at levels posing a threat to {{human health and the}} environment. These wastes remained on the land surface and migrated through the environment by washing into streams and leaching contaminants into surface water and groundwater. The site was added to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Priorities List in 1983,. Investigation of the site began in the mid-1980s. Since 1995, EPA and the potentially responsible parties have conducted removal and remedial activities to consolidate, contain and control more than 350,000 cubic yards of contaminated soils, sediments and mine-processing wastes. Cleanups by the potentially responsible parties have involved drainage controls to prevent acid mine runoff, consolidation and capping of mine piles, cleanup of residential properties and reuse of slag.

Ecological study. St. Louis, Missouri. Blood lead levels. Official reports of violent crimes were categorized as 1) crimes involving a firearm (yes/no), 2) assault crimes (with or without a firearm), 3) robbery crimes (with or without a firearm), 4) homicides and 5) rape. With the exception of rape, aggregate <b>blood-lead</b> <b>levels</b> were statistically significant predictors of violent crime at the census tract level.

40|$|A {{recent article}} in the American Journal of Public Health noted the high {{correlation}} between the lead content of soil in urban areas and the elevated <b>blood-lead</b> <b>levels</b> of children in these cities. An editorial {{in the same issue}} of the Journal suggested that the "use of leaded gasoline and [high] traffic density" helped explain the is observation. For most public health experts, the controversy over the possible adverse effects of leaded gasoline began in the 1970 s. What we intend to show in this paper is that as early as the 1920 s public health experts, government officials, scientists, corporate leaders, labor, and the public were acutely aware of the dangers posed by the introduction of lead into gasoline. The depth of concern was manifested by the fact that leaded gasoline was banned in New York City for over three years and in many states and other municipalities for shorter periods of time. In 1925, the production of leaded gasoline was halted for over nine months, During the 1920 s, the petrochemical and automobile industries emerged as the corporate backbone of the United States. Because the acceptance or rejection of leaded gasoline had profound implications for these industries. a spirited and often heated controversy arose. Public health professionals found themselves under intense pressure to sanction and minimize the hazards associated with the manufacture and use of this new potentially toxic substance and the pages of the American Journal of Public Health were compromised during the months and years when the fate of leaded gasoline was being decided. The debates of that era centered on issues of health and public policy that remain current today. Numerous questions arose regarding the evaluation of health hazards associated with new and potentially harmful substances, including: How can scientists evaluate the relative importance of acute and chronic effects of toxic substances? What should constitute adequate proof of safety or harm? What business, professional, or government agendas should be responsible for evaluating possibly dangerous substances? How does one study potentially toxic substances while protecting the right to health of human subjects? Does industry have to prove a new substance safe or do public health experts have to prove it dangerous...|$|R
