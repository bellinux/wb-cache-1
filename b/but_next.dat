For a few years there were rumors of abandoning Detroit to compete for Cincinnati or Pittsburgh but the two leagues made peace in 1903 after similar moves into St. Louis and New York.|$|E
25|$|Nicholaus Smithurst, vicar of East Stoke, {{recorded}} 49 communicants, no recusants {{and just}} two dissenters in Syerston. Demographic historians {{suggest that the}} proportion of the population over 16 in such settlements at the time was about 65%, which implies a total population of about 78. The Rev Smithurst found no Catholics or other dissenters in East Stoke or Elston Chapel, <b>but</b> <b>next</b> door Flintham was a hot spot of nonconformity and the vicar, Edward Guy, found as many as 40 dissenters. At any rate the authorities had little need to fear papistry in Syerston.|$|E

25|$|Jackdaw was {{carrying}} letters from Admiral Collingwood to England {{on a course}} along the Portuguese coast. On 15 February 1807 she spotted three sails, which altered their course towards her. A chase developed <b>but</b> <b>next</b> morning {{the largest of the}} three, a lateen-rigged vessel, was observed to be only five miles behind and using sweeps to catch up. Jackdaw fired a handful of shots before the vessel took up a raking position on Jackdaws quarter and hoisted a Spanish flag. Brice consulted with the Mate, John Edwards, and the two convinced each other that as they had only two guns mounted, and a total of only 17 men on board, resistance was futile. They therefore struck.|$|E
25|$|CI Thornton had put {{together}} a strong side which included six Yorkshiremen. They won the toss at the North Marine Road ground at Scarborough and batted. They slumped to 79/6 but their captain, Stanley Jackson, scored 72 and led a partial recovery. Trumble took 5/62 and Saunders 5/74. The Australians were 31/2 at the day's end. Next day, Trumper made 62 and Hopkins 49*, but the tourists led by only 49 on first innings. Wilfred Rhodes took 4/95 and George Thompson 3/32. By close of play the home side were 87/6 in their second innings, <b>but</b> <b>next</b> day Johnny Tyldesley, who had been 55* overnight, went on to make 88. An unbroken last wicket stand of 52 by Haigh and Rhodes enabled Thornton's XI to declare. Saunders finished with 5/95. When Trumper (55) was the fourth wicket to fall, the visitors gave up the chase for the 154 {{that they needed to}} win and accepted the draw, having batted for 24.5 overs.|$|E
25|$|In a low-scoring {{match at}} the Liverpool Cricket Club Ground at Aigburth, the {{tourists}} almost suffered their third defeat. George Littlewood and Alexander Kermode shared 36 of the 38 overs in the Australian first innings, taking 5/49 and 5/68 respectively. At {{the end of}} the first day, Lancashire were 61/2, only 77 behind, <b>but</b> <b>next</b> morning they lost two wickets without adding to their score and only added another 44, Saunders finishing with 6/52. In their second innings, the Australians were 91/4, but then lost their last 6 wickets while only 14 runs were added. Littlewood took 7/49 for match figures of 12/98. At the close of the second day, the county were 77/5, needing only a further 47 to win. They added another 16 before the sixth wicket fell, but only managed 12 more before being all out. Trumble took 5/44 and Saunders 4/37. Littlewood's figures in each innings were his best in first-class cricket at the time, as were Kermode's in the first innings.|$|E

25|$|With Admiral Hugo von Pohl {{becoming}} mortally-ill and Admiral Reinhard Scheer taking {{command of}} the German High Seas Fleet on 18 January 1916, the Germans began {{to take a more}} offensive strategy in the North Sea. Hitherto the German fleet had spared the army the burden of coast defence and encouraged the neutrality of the Netherlands and Scandinavia. The British blockade of Germany was causing hunger and the Germans lacked the staying power of the British and Scheer desired to find some means to counter British sea power. The High Seas Fleet could only prevail against the Grand Fleet in exceptional circumstances, which Jellicoe would never allow but Scheer thought that he could make the British war-weary and German raids in the North Sea became more frequent. On 9 February, the Admiralty warned the Grand Fleet that the Germans were stirring and the fleet was ordered south, the cruisers of Harwich Force being ordered to sail for Texel. A few hours later the alert was cancelled <b>but</b> <b>next</b> day, it was discovered that a force of light cruisers and destroyers had sailed westwards from the Jade river.|$|E
25|$|In October, when {{schemes for}} marrying Mary to an English nobleman were under consideration, Knollys {{proposed}} that his wife's nephew, George Carey, might prove a suitable match. In November the inquiry into Mary's misdeeds which had begun at York, was reopened at Westminster, and Knollys {{pointed out that}} he needed a larger company of retainers to keep his prisoner safe from a possible attempt at rescue. In December he was directed by Elizabeth to induce Mary to assent to her abdication of the Scottish throne. In January 1569 he plainly told Elizabeth that, in declining to allow Mary either to be condemned or to be acquitted on the charges brought against her, she was inviting perils which were likely to overwhelm her, and entreated her to leave the decision of Mary's fate to her well-tried councillors. On 20 January orders arrived at Bolton to transfer Mary to Tutbury, where the Earl of Shrewsbury was {{to take charge of}} her. Against the removal the Scottish queen protested in a pathetic note to Knollys, intended for Elizabeth's eye, <b>but</b> <b>next</b> day she was forced to leave Bolton, and Knollys remained with her at Tutbury till 3 February. His wife's death then called him home. Mary blamed Elizabeth for the fatal termination of Lady Knollys' illness, attributing it to her husband's enforced absence in the north.|$|E

Lopez added that Bourdain had recently arrived from Peru, where he drank several pisco sours which he thought tasted better than the Chilean version.|$|E

500|$|Jardine was {{the centre}} of {{attention}} {{at the start of}} the tour. He began the tour with three consecutive hundreds and was seen as one of the main English threats. In his first hundred, the crowd engaged in some good-natured joking at Jardine's expense, but he was jeered by the crowd in his second hundred for batting too slowly. His third hundred was described by Bradman as one of the finest exhibitions of strokeplay that he had seen; Jardine accelerated after another slow start, during which he was again barracked, to play some excellent shots. The crowds took an increasing dislike to him, partially for his success with the bat, but mainly for his superior attitude and bearing, his awkward fielding, and particularly his choice of headwear. His first public action in South Australia was to take out the members of the South Australian team who had been to Oxford or Cambridge Universities. Then, he wore a Harlequin cap, given to people who played good cricket at Oxford. It was not unusual for Oxford and Cambridge cricketers to wear similar caps while batting, as both Jardine and M.C.C. captain Percy Chapman did so on this tour, although it was slightly unorthodox to wear them while fielding. However, this was neither understood nor acceptable to the Australian crowds. They quickly took exception to the importance he seemed to place on class distinction. Although Jardine may simply have worn the cap out of superstition, it conveyed a negative impression to the spectators, with his general demeanour drawing one comment of [...] "Where's the butler to carry the bat for you?" [...] Jardine's cap became a focus for criticism and mockery from the crowds throughout the tour. Nevertheless, Jack Fingleton later claimed that Jardine could still have brought the crowds onto his side by exchanging jokes or pleasantries with them. It is certain that Jardine by this stage had developed an intense dislike for Australian crowds. During his third century {{at the start of the}} tour, during a period of abuse from the spectators, he observed to a sympathetic Hunter Hendry that [...] "All Australians are uneducated, and an unruly mob". After the innings, when Patsy Hendren said that the Australian crowds did not like Jardine, he replied [...] "It's fucking mutual". Due to the large number of good close fielders in the side, Jardine did not field in the slips, his usual position for Surrey, <b>but</b> <b>next</b> to the crowd on the boundary. There, he was roundly abused and mocked, particularly when chasing the ball: he was not a good fielder on the boundary. In one of the Test matches, he spat towards the crowd while fielding on the boundary as he changed position for the final time.|$|E
