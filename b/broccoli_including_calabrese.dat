40|$|Analysis of {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) data is becoming ever more computationally demanding as temporal and spatial resolutions improve, and large, publicly available data sets proliferate. Moreover, methodological improvements in the neuroimaging pipeline, such as non-linear spatial normalization, non-parametric permutation tests and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches, can dramatically increase the computational burden. Despite these challenges, there do not yet exist any fMRI software packages which leverage inexpensive and powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) to perform these analyses. Here, we therefore present BROCCOLI, a free software package written in OpenCL (Open Computing Language) {{that can be used for}} parallel analysis of fMRI data on a large variety of hardware configurations. BROCCOLI has, for example, been tested with an Intel CPU, an Nvidia GPU and an AMD GPU. These tests show that parallel processing of fMRI data can lead to significantly faster analysis pipelines. This speedup can be achieved on relatively standard hardware, but further, dramatic speed improvements require only a modest investment in GPU hardware. BROCCOLI (running on a GPU) can perform non-linear spatial normalization to a 1 mm 3 brain template in 4 - 6 seconds, and run a second level permutation test with 10, 000 permutations in about a minute. These non-parametric tests are generally more robust than their parametric counterparts, and can also enable more sophisticated analyses by estimating complicated null distributions. Additionally, <b>BROCCOLI</b> <b>includes</b> support for Bayesian first-level fMRI analysis using a Gibbs sampler. The new software is freely available under GNU GPL 3 and can be downloaded from github ([URL]...|$|R

50|$|Early {{waves of}} Italian-American {{immigrants}} typically {{did not speak}} the form of Italian which originated from the Tuscan language, or spoke it {{as a second language}} acquired in school. Instead they typically spoke other Italo-Romance languages, particularly from Southern Italy, such as Sicilian language and Neapolitan language. Both of these languages have wide variety of dialects within them, <b>including</b> Salentino, <b>Calabrese,</b> etc. Additionally many villages may have spoken other non Italo-Romance minority languages such as Griko or the Arbëresh language. Today, the Italian language, which is most similar to the Tuscan (although not the same), is widely taught in Italian schools. Although many other minority languages have official status in Italy neither Sicilian language nor Neapolitan language are recognised by the Italian Republic. Although Italy is a signatory to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages it has not ratified the treaty. Thus limiting Italy's responsibility in the preservation of regional languages that it has not chosen to protect by domestic law.|$|R

40|$|NYS IPM Type: Vegetables IPM Fact SheetSwede midge (Contarinia nasturtii) {{is a small}} (1 / 16 ” long) {{invasive}} fly that is {{a serious}} pest of Brassica (cruciferous) vegetable crops, <b>including</b> <b>broccoli,</b> cabbage, and kale. The insect was named for one of its hosts in Europe, the “swede,” a type of forage turnip. Management of swede midge is particularly challenging because of its small size, hidden feeding behavior, low damage threshold, and life cycle consisting of multiple overlapping generations during the growing season. Small-scale organic growers with insufficient space for crop rotation to break the swede midge life cycle are especially at risk for economic losses from this pest...|$|R
40|$|How to grow {{successfully}} broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, and kohlrabi. Cole crops, which <b>include</b> <b>broccoli,</b> brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, and kohlrabi, can {{be successfully}} grown on most soils if drainage {{is good and}} the crop is supplied with adequate water and nutrients, particularly nitrogen. Light-textured soils usually produce earlier crops but heavier soils hold more moisture and tend to produce crops that hold quality longer at maturity. Cole crops have shallow root systems. Inadequate moisture may cause small cauliflower heads to form prematurely. Rainfall or irrigation following a prolonged dry spell may cause splitting of cabbage and kohlrabi. Supplemental irrigation is important for growing cole crops in Nebraska...|$|R

40|$|A unique {{broccoli}} x broccoli {{doubled haploid}} (DH) {{population has been}} created from the F- 1 of a cross between two DH broccoli lines derived from cultivars Green Duke and Marathon. We genotyped 154 individuals from this population with simple sequence repeat and amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to create a B. oleracea L. var. italica 'intra-crop' specific framework linkage map. The map is composed of nine linkage groups with a total length of 946. 7 cM. Previous published B. oleracea maps have been constructed using diverse crosses between morphotypes of B. oleracea; this map therefore represents a useful breeding resource for the dissection of broccoli specific traits. Phenotype data have been collected from the population over five growing seasons; the framework linkage map {{has been used to}} locate quantitative trait loci for agronomically important <b>broccoli</b> traits <b>including</b> head weight (saleable yield), head diameter, stalk diameter, weight loss and relative weight loss during storage, as well as traits for broccoli leaf architecture.

40|$|Lutein and {{zeaxanthin}} are carotenoids {{that are}} selectively taken {{up into the}} macula of the eye, where they are thought {{to protect against the}} development of age-related macular degeneration. They are obtained from dietary sources, with the highest concentrations found in dark green leafy vegetables, such as kale and spinach. In this Review, compositional variations due to variety/cultivar, stage of maturity, climate or season, farming practice, storage, and processing effects are highlighted. Only data from studies which report on lutein and zeaxanthin content in foods are reported. The main focus is kale; however, other predominantly xanthophyll containing vegetables such as spinach and <b>broccoli</b> are <b>included.</b> A small amount of data about exotic fruits is also referenced for comparison. The qualitative and quantitative composition of carotenoids in fruits and vegetables is known to vary with multiple factors. In kale, lutein and zeaxanthin levels are affected by pre-harvest effects such as maturity, climate, and farming practice. Further {{research is needed to determine}} the post-harvest processing and storage effects of lutein and zeaxanthin in kale; this will enable precise suggestions for increasing retinal levels of these nutrients...|$|R
30|$|A main {{question}} remains {{what happens in}} humans when they consume higher amounts of cruciferous vegetables. Jiang and colleagues [15] have studied the effects of vegetable intake in 1005 middle-aged Chinese women. Indeed, an increased intake of cruciferous vegetables was associated with decreased serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 β, TNFα and IL- 6 supporting the concept of many in vitro studies {{that this type of}} diet may have anti-inflammatory properties. As nutrition contributes substantially to disease development, it remains crucial and mandatory to better understand how diets enriched in vegetables and fruits might constitute anti-inflammatory effects. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a transcription factor expressed by immune cells, epithelial cells, and some tumor cells, has been identified as fundamental receptor for certain dietary components. Indeed, in the last years many exogenous and endogenous AhR ligands have been characterized—some derived from foods such as <b>broccoli,</b> other <b>include</b> phytochemicals, natural chemicals, and bacterial metabolites. Ligand binding activates the AhR, resulting in its translocation into the nucleus, where it dimerizes with the AhR nuclear translocator. This heterodimer regulates many genes that control immunity and inflammation, such as the important barrier cytokine IL- 22, which has many beneficial metabolic functions [16].|$|R
