5|$|Little {{academic}} {{discourse on}} Joehana was published until the 1960s; according to Kartini et al., this {{is attributable to}} Joehana's use of non-formal Sundanese.

Rosidi, that magazine's editor, included discussion of Joehana in his 1966 book Kesusastraan Sunda Dewasa Ini (Contemporary Sundanese Literature). Some more discussion, by authors such as Yus Rusyana and Rusman Sutiamarga, was published in magazines such as Wangsit or included in university lectures.
