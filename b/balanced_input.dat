50|$|For a {{distributed}} amplifier the input is fed in series into the amplifiers and parallel out of them. To avoid {{losses in the}} input, no input signal is allowed to leak through. This is avoided by using a <b>balanced</b> <b>input</b> and output also known as push-pull amplifier. Then all signals which leak through the parasitic capacitances cancel. The output is combined in a delay line with decreasing impedance.

The previous theoretical justification for using anything other than IID U(0, 1) points shows consistency for estimated means, but only applies for discrete stationary distributions. We extend those results to some MCMC algorithms for continuous stationary distributions. The main motivation is the search for quasi-Monte Carlo versions of MCMC.
