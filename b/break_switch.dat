40|$|A {{stable and}} {{reliable}} {{electric power supply}} system is an inevitable pre-requisite for the technological and economic growth of any nation. Due to this, utilities must strive and ensure that the customer s reliability requirements are met and the regulators requirements satisfied at the lowest possible cost. It is known fact {{around the world that}} 90 % of the of the customer service interruptions are caused due to failure in distribution system. Therefore, it is worth considering reliability worth assessments as it provides an opportunity to incorporate the cost or losses incurred by the utilities customer as a result of power failure and this must be considered in planning and operating practices. The system modeling and simulation study is carried out on one of the district s distribution system which consists of 33 kV and 11 kV network in Bhutan. The reliability assessment is done on both 11 and 33 kV system to assess the performance of the present system and also predictive reliability analysis for the future system considering load growth and system expansion. The alternative which gives low SAIDI, SAIFI and minimum breakeven costs are being assessed and considered. The reliability of 33 kV system could be further improved by installation of load <b>break</b> <b>switch,</b> auto recloser and connecting with line coming from other district (reserve) at reasonable break even cost. The decision base could be further improved by having Bhutan s context interruption cost. However, the questionnaire s which may be used in Bhutan to acquire interruption costs from the customers are being proposed. The utility should have their own reliability improvement strategy depending upon their needs and requirements of the regulators. Although there is no magic bullet in managing power quality issues, utilities can maximize network performance and better serve customers by diligently addressing trouble prone areas. In order to achieve this objective, a computer program NetBas/Lesvik is used to run load flow and reliability analysis, thus selecting the alternatives either based on reliability indices or on cost benefit ratio. </p...|$|E
40|$|In today’s society the {{electric}} grid {{has become one}} of the most important infrastructures and industries as well as other infrastructures, and individuals rely on its functionality. The unavailability of electricity caused by outages is increasingly rare but when it occurs it can have serious consequences. An electric grid’s reliability is now a requirement, not only from customers but also from the regulatory authority. The electric grid in Stockholm is owned and operated by Ellevio AB. Over the past decade the reliability, measured in SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index), in the area has deterioated, mainly due to failures of the medium voltage grid (11 - kV, MV). The network structure on the MV- grid consists primarily of two parallel medium voltage cables each of which acts redundantly to its pair cable. The technique, called dual cable structure, works most optimally with substations with automatic switching, which automaticly switch over to the redundant cable when failure occurs. However substations without this automatic switching are widely used resulting in a longer interruption time. Another network structure is the ring or loop structure, which still has redundancy, but when failure occurs a load- <b>break</b> <b>switch</b> must close so that the grid can be fed from another direction. The substation in the loop structure can also be remotely controlled, making the load-break swith operable from the control center, resulting in a shorter interruption time. This thesis evaluates and compares different network structures consisting of dual cable with automatic switching and loop structure with remotely controlled substations, based on economy and reliability, on Stora Essingen. The two structures have been designed in the network information system program Trimble NIS and divided into two different environments; one developed and one undeveloped environment. The results show that the technical solutions in network structures of MV- grid do not necessarily mean major differences in economy nor reliability, rather the choice between few but long interruptions and many but short interruptions is central. Results show however that a combination of the dual cable structure with remotely controlled substations in the undeveloped environment is economically motivated while the reliability can be maintained at the same tame...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the result of}} pilot project that creates an intelligent outage management System which accurately locates faults in real-time and send fault details to the relevant maintenance crew. Several measures of reliability indices have been developed by the electric utility industry to measure system performance. The reliability of supply is governed by the frequency and the duration of interruptions to supply {{and the number of}} customers affected by interruption. An Outage Management System (OMS) will certainly help utilities identify and restore outages sooner and more efficiently. A fault affected zone in the distribution network can be isolated from the healthy part of the network by disconnecting the affected sector using Air Break Switches, Drift down Lift Off switches, (D. D. L. O) or Autoreclosers. That equipment can be used to optimize the restoring process by isolating smallest possible section of the network affected by fault. Without confining merely to an Outage Management System (OMS), this can be further developed to a supervisory control and Data Acquisition system (SCADA) that facilitate distribution automation function with communications, help to strengthen existing distribution systems and provide a strong foundation for building a fully implemented feeder scheme. But presently Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) which is the national utility responsible for the major portion of distribution of electrical power in Sri Lanka is not taking maximum usage of automation facility of currently available equipment. There is no proper coordination between automated equipment. Also proper automatic reporting and recording system is not available. As a result of this, expected level of reliability improvement couldn't be achieved. Hence the automatic outage program can be used to overcome above shortage. Main objective of the project is to develop automatic outage reporting and controlling system for the North Western Province Branch of CEB, integrating all switching facilities like Auto recloses, GSM fault indicators, Non GSM fault indicators and Load <b>break</b> <b>switch</b> to improve distribution network reliability. The proposed outage management system has modern features such as Data acquisitioning from GSM fault indicators, storing the data for future analysis, indicating the fault location in network diagram, Generating the massage automatically and sending to nearest crew, and Capable of handling data base files. Since North Western Province has very complicated electrical network, Thulhiriya - Kuliyapitiy feeder which has large number of transformers and having long length is selected as pilot project considering distribution indices such as System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) using past outage data of year 2008 and 2009. Based on SynerGEE software reliability data, the locations to install new GSM type fault indicators, Non GSM type fault indicators were identified. So 10 number of GSM type fault indicators, 20 number of Non GSM type fault indicators, 08 number of DDLOs, were installed. The outage management system was developed using Visual Basic 6 for usage of at the Distribution Control Centre. Then program was installed in the control centre and executed for six months. Then the reported break down was compared with break down history of the feeder and Financial Feasibility Analysis was done. It was observed that the initial investment is paid back within first four years which indicates the implement of the Outage Management system is financially feasible. Also the significant improvement of reliability could be observed...|$|E
40|$|Current {{interruption}} {{is vital}} {{in the power}} system, as this {{makes it possible to}} control the use of different loads, change the grid configuration, and minimize damage when faults occur. This thesis presents a study of the different switch design and test circuit parameters involved in medium voltage air load break switching and how they affect the thermal interrupting capability. Mediumvoltage load break switches are common in the distribution grid, and are a cheaper option than installing circuit breakers. Medium voltage load current ratings are typically in the range of 6 – 36 kV and 400 A up to around 1 kA (50 Hz). Air is considered an environmentally benign alternative as an interrupting medium compared to SF 6 for these ratings, and is also thought to be cost-competitive compared to vacuum. However, no compact air load <b>break</b> <b>switch</b> for 24 kV is currently available for commercial use. Thus, it is necessary to have a good understanding of the design parameters involved, and how they affect the interrupting capability of the switch. This thesis addresses medium-voltage load current interruption in air. It is an empirical study based on an extensive test program in a medium voltage test lab, and the main results and contents of this thesis are presented in five papers. The two first are switch design parameter studies. Using a test switch that is simple and axisymmetric, yet in many aspects similar to commercial puffer devices, one test switch parameter has been changed at a time to find the air flow over-pressure needed for successful interruption. The test circuit settings are also varied to find how the interrupting capability changes with load currents in the range 400 – 880 A, and with a transient recovery voltage corresponding to IEC’s 24 kV ”mainly active load” test duty. Only the thermal phase of current interruption has been considered, i. e. the first tens of microseconds after current zero. The over-pressures needed to interrupt the load currents were typically from 0. 2 to 0. 4 bar. The third paper presents a logistic regression analysis of all the conducted interruption tests, with the goal of describing the interruption performance {{as a function of the}} main test switch design parameters and transient recovery voltage stresses. More than 3 000 interruption tests are used as input data for this analysis, which produce a mathematical expression that summarizes all the empirical results. The nozzle-to-contact diameter ratio has been found to be an important design factor. Low ratios require a substantially lower air over-pressure than high nozzle-to-contact diameter ratios in order to interrupt successfully. The choice of contact diameter important as well, where larger contact diameters require lower over-pressures, but higher mass flow rates. The nozzle length does not influence the interrupting capability very much, but the chance of successful interruption is greater when the pin contact has moved out of the nozzle at current zero. The interruption becomes more difficult with increasing current and the rate of the voltage build-up across the contacts after interruption. The other two papers are based on the current interruption experiments mentioned above, but concern details of the arc behavior and arc voltage under different currents, test design variations and air flow conditions. For typical medium-voltage and load current ratings, the arc greatly affects the air flow during current interruption. The flow through the tulip contact and nozzle is clogged during the high current part of the half-cycle, even for moderate currents and relatively large contact dimensions. The typical over-pressures needed for successful interruption correspond to air velocities that are well below supersonic level. The arc voltage is a function of several parameters, and rises with increasing air over-pressure, decreasing current, and a larger contact gap. There is also a clear visible difference in the arc appearance when it is either subjected to forced cooling or not. The typical arc voltage is a few hundred volts...|$|E

This paper investigates the possibility of type testing of MV LBS using synthetic test procedures. The transient recovery voltage (TRV) required is calculated from both IEC and IEEE standards and it is shown that the IEC TRV specification results in a more severe TRV. It is found that testing with a basic Weil circuit requires two-part testing. In one test, a low-amplitude TRV with a fast rate of rise stresses the early region associated with thermal failure. In the other test, a higher-amplitude slowly rising TRV stresses the later dielectric region. However, the two-part test using the unmodified Weil circuit is shown to cause significant TRV overstressing. Insertion of a precharged capacitor and additional damping resistors into the Weil circuit at critical times using triggered spark gaps are found to be effective to reduce overstressing. Simulation results show {{that it is possible to}} use a modified synthetic test circuit to test LBS with voltage ratings of up to 38 kV and load currents of 800 A...|$|R

Such polymers, known as ablation material, decompose and evaporate when exposed to heat from {{an electric}} arc. The evaporated polymer improves current interruption capability by increased pressure and heat dissipation. The target is to use arc quenching properties of ablation material {{to reduce the size}} of load <b>break</b> <b>switches</b> (LBSs) that interrupts current in atmospheric air. Consequently, the air insulated LBSs can be more competitive to more compact SF 6 insulated breakers. The present thesis is an experimental study of polypropylene (PP) as ablation material. Experiments are performed in a medium-voltage (MV) laboratory to determine the interruption limits with regards to current level and shape of transient recovery voltage (TRV). Little has earlier been published in this field of study so the design of the test switch is developed through experimental work. The test switch interrupts the thermal part of the current interruption for all tested currents, up to 800 A. Even for hard TRVs the switch interrupted the thermal part to an impressive degree. The dielectric strength in the arcing zone after the thermal phase is however a larger challenge. For a current of 800 A, the test switch struggles to withstand a recovery voltage higher than 6 kV the first 300 &# 181;s after current zero (CZ) crossing. The ablation effect is more or less self-regulated since the arc intensity is directly related to current magnitude. Experiments indicate that the test switch struggles with low currents since the heat becomes too low. However, the thermal part is still interrupted for a current of 80 A, but recovery voltages above 2 kV the first 200 &# 181;s after CZ crossing &# 181;s is likely to cause a re-ignition. </p...|$|R
