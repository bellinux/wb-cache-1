30|$|The above results {{prove that}} Au NP {{formation}} occurs {{as early as}} 1  h after reaction in the <b>bomb</b> <b>digestion</b> vessel, whereas a typical reaction takes 4 – 5  h to complete in an open vessel [16]. This shows {{that the rate of}} reaction between Au 3 + ions and polyphenols increases rapidly when heated in a closed container. The 5 -h reaction product, however, shows a distinct microstructure comprising predominantly of nanorods throughout the grid. The phenomenal change in microstructure from experiment 2 – 3 could be attributed to the fact that a lot of pressure develops inside the bomb upon constant heating at 200  °C for 5  h. This excess pressure leads to the conversion of spherical Au NPs into rod-like structures. Similar results were also observed in the case of cobalt NPs prepared by a chemical reaction in <b>bomb</b> <b>digestion</b> vessel [24].|$|E

The longitudinal SPR band of gold nanorods at 745  nm is of great importance for biological applications.

The pristine rubrene NPs were treated hydrothermally for 10 h using a hydrothermal autoclave (Parr Instrument Acid <b>Digestion</b> <b>Bombs,</b> 4744 General Purpose Bomb, Parr Instrument Company, Moline, IL, USA). Hydrothermal treatment occurred at 110 °C, 130 °C, 140 °C, 150 °C, 160 °C, 170 °C, and 180 °C with samples denoted HT- 110, HT- 130, HT- 140, HT- 150, HT- 160, HT- 170, and HT- 180, respectively.

40|$|Mixed {{actinide}} dioxides {{are currently}} studied as potential fuels for several concepts associated {{to the fourth}} generation of nuclear reactors. These solids are generally obtained through dry chemistry processes from powder mixtures but could present some heterogeneity {{in the distribution of}} the cations in the solid. In this context, wet chemistry methods were set up for the preparation of U 1 −xThxO 2 solid solutions as model compounds for advanced dioxide fuels. Two chemical routes of preparation, involving the precipitation of crystallized precursor, were investigated: on the one hand, a mixture of acidic solutions containing cations and oxalic acid was introduced in an open vessel, leading to a poorly-crystallized precipitate. On the other hand, the starting mixture was placed in an acid <b>digestion</b> <b>bomb</b> then set in an oven in order to reach hydrothermal conditions. By this way, small single-crystals were obtained then characterized by several techniques including XRD and SEM.

30|$|Recently, many biosynthetic routes {{have been}} {{reported}} for synthesis of Au NPs through micro-organisms such as algae, fungi and bacteria. However, due to their cumbersome procedures such as maintaining cell cultures under specified laboratory conditions have made them less attractive, when compared to using plant products for synthesis of nanomaterials. Many plants or plant products have been employed for the synthesis of Au NPs, some of which include, Emblica officinalis, Acacia nilotica (Babool), alfalfa biomass, geranium, Azadirachta indica leaves, gum kondagogu, gram-beans and tea leaves [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Camellia sinensis commonly known as tea is {{a rich source of}} polyphenolic compounds, which exhibits a variety of health benefits such as protection against heart diseases, cancer and the paralytic actions of botulinum neurotoxins [18, 19]. These attractive health benefits apart from its complete green approach have turned tea extract as an important species for synthesis of NPs. However, tea extract has been utilized only for the synthesis of spherical NPs with SPR bands in the visible region. To enhance its biocompatibility, the SPR band needs to be tuned {{in such a way that}} it lies close to the NIR region, where biological tissues tend to absorb minimally. Therefore, synthesis of Au NPs with rod-like structures using green processes becomes crucial. Many reports have earlier been published to control the shape of Au NPs to form nanorods, but they require multi-pronged and cumbersome experimental procedures such as seed-mediated growth [20, 21, 22]. In this work, we report a novel, simple, single-stage selective biosynthesis route for production of Au NPs in the form of spheroids and rods. To obtain the desired shape of Au NPs, aqueous chloroaurate ions were reacted with an extract of Camellia sinensis (tea) leaves in a stainless steel <b>bomb</b> <b>digestion</b> vessel for different time intervals.|$|E
40|$|The purpose {{with this}} thesis {{was to find}} out if {{ordinary}} office paper was homogenous throughout the sheet in context of organic and elemental content. Two different types of papers were also analyzed, paper towel and corrugated paperboard. The techniques used were NIR, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy for the evaluation of organic contents, and ICP-AES/MS for the measurement of elemental composition and concentration. Spectrofluorometry was also utilized to establish if the content of optical brightener was homogenous in all paper types. The spectroscopic techniques didn’t require any sample preparation except for cutting the papers in pieces, according to their “geographical” place in the sheets. The ICP-AES and ICP-MS analyses required sample preparation in form of cutting the pieces and digesting each of them with acid and hydrogen peroxide in <b>digestion</b> <b>bombs.</b> After the <b>digestion</b> the samples were diluted with purified water. The results showed that NIR and spectrofluorometry couldn’t differentiate samples within one sheet of all paper types, although NIR made a distinction between the office paper samples. FT-IR on the other hand could distinguish between samples in one group from samples belonging to another group further away within same sheet. The elemental concentrations of sample pieces were also significantly different within same sheet of office paper, paper towel and corrugated paperboard. This elemental distinction could be made in both ICP-AES and ICP-MS. The results from Raman spectroscopy were unusable due to gained broad bands as spectra instead of peaks, {{the reason for that is}} high fluorescence. Different laser intensities were used with no change in result. Syftet med arbetet var att undersöka homogeniteten hos papper med avseende på sammansättningen av grundämnen, organiska komponenter samt optiskt vitmedel. Tre olika sorters papper användes A 4 papper, hushållspapper och wellpapp. Tekniker som användes för detta syfte var ICP-AES (inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy) och ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy) för koncentrationsbestämning av element. NIR (near-infrared spectroscopy), FT-IR (fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy) och Raman spektroskopi användes för analys av de organiska komponenterna i pappret samt spektrofluorometri för mätning av optiskt vitmedel och andra fluorescerande molekyler i pappret. Provupparbetning krävdes för analys med ICP-AES och ICP-MS. De olika papperstyperna upplöstes med olika sammansättning av syra och väteperoxid i Uhrbergsbomber, efter upphettning kyldes proverna till rumstemperatur och späddes med milli-Q vatten. Samma prover som användes för ICP-AES analyserna späddes med thallium internstandard innan analys med ICP-MS. De andra spektroskopiska teknikerna krävde ingen provupparbetning, annat än urklippning av pappersbitar som skulle passa provbehållaren. Resultaten visade att ICP-AES/MS kunde diskriminera olika element i olika koncentrationer genom ett helt ark. Detta gällde för alla papperstyper. FT-IR var också diskriminernande för vissa prover inom alla papperssorter, medan resultaten från NIR och spektrofluorometri analyserna inte kunde urskilja olika prover inom ett och samma ark. Detta tyder på att dessa instrument inte kan uppvisa någon inhomogenitet hos pappret med avseende på organisk sammansättning respektive innehållet av optiskt vitmedel...|$|R

While in the latter the N,N'-chelated 2, 2 '-bpy ligands of adjacent corner-shared {MO 4 N 2 } octahedra are positioned {{on the same side}} of the 1 D chain, in 1 the 2, 2 '-bpy ligands alternate above and below the chain. The catalytic behavior of compound 1 for the epoxidation of cis-cyclooctene was compared with that for several other tungsten- or molybdenum-based (pre) catalysts, including the hybrid polymer [MoO 3 (2, 2 '-bpy) ]. While the latter exhibits superior performance when tert-butyl hydropercndde (TBHP) is used as the oxidant, compound 1 is superior when aqueous hydrogen peroxide is used, allowing near-quantitative conversion of the olefin to the epoxide.

Reaction of 2 with excess tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) led to {{the isolation of the}} oxodiperoxo complex [MoO(O- 2) (2) (pzpy) (4) ] (5). Single-crystal X-ray structures of 3 and 5 are described.

In the crystal structure of 1, the close packing of individual anionic polymers, DMA(+) cations, and water molecules is mediated by a series of supramolecular contacts, namely strong (O-H center dot center dot center dot O, N+-H center dot center dot center dot O-) and weak (C-H center dot center dot center dot O) hydrogen bonding interactions, and pi-pi contacts involving adjacent coordinated Hbpdc(-) ligands. The catalytic potential of 1 was investigated in the epoxidation reactions of the bioderived olefins methyl oleate (Ole) and DL-limonene (Lim) using tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxygen donor and 1, 2 -dichloroethane (DCE) or (trifluoromethyl) benzene (BTF) as cosolvent, at 55 or 75 degrees C.

40|$|Land {{contaminated}} with heavy metals such as Cd and Zn can be remediated using {{a number of}} different approaches. Many of these strategies are very expensive (e. g. removal and disposal of the soil, covering the soil with uncontaminated soil, extraction with acids or chelates) whilst others provide only short term solutions (e. g. reduction of metal bioavailability by liming or adding organic matter). An alternative approach is the use of hyperaccumulator plants to remove the heavy metals. Phytoremediation, as this process is known, is an attractive method for remediation of contaminated land since it is relatively inexpensive and has the potential through the appropriate selection of plant species to be effective. However, there are many factors that need to be considered for phytoremediation, perhaps the most important is the bioavailability of metals from different component or functional pools within the soil. The bioavailability of heavy metals has been assessed through a variety of approaches, with extraction using chemicals being the most common. Another approach is the isotopic exchange method which has been regularly used for estimating the bioavailable P in soil. This technique relies on the assumption that isotopically exchangeable P is available to a growing plant and yields the so called E-value for a soil. In past studies, particularly in highly P fixing soils, the E-value has been shown to overestimate the soil available P. To overcome this a second procedure based on the measurement of isotope uptake by a plant growing on a spiked soil has been proposed and yields the so called L-value. As well as P, this method has been applied to Ni and only very recently to Cd and Zn using radioisotopes. In the present work, stable isotopes are used {{for the first time to}} measure the Cd and Zn available for plant uptake using isotopic exchange principles based on the E and L-values using a contaminated (Great Billings) and a non-contaminated (Countesswells) soil. These values were compared to Cd and Zn bioavailable pool determined using more traditional chemical extraction methods (5 extractants). Of the chemical extractants O. 1 M NaNO 3, 0. 01 M CaC 12, 0. 5 M NaOH, 0. 43 M CH 3 COOH and 0. 05 M EDTA (pH= 7. 0), the highest amounts of Cd and Zn were extracted by CH 3 COOH and EDTA. In addition, these two extractants extracted the Cd and Zn amounts close to the Lvalues determined using the isotopic exchange method. An isotope dilution thermal ionisation mass spectrometric (ID-TIMS) method for an accurate and precise determination of Cd and Zn in soils and plants via isotope ratio measurements was developed. This was then validated by quantifying Cd and Zn in soils, plant and animal Certified Reference Materials digested by three different methods. In addition, there was no significant difference between open tube aqua regia, closed microwave <b>bombs</b> and HF <b>digestion</b> procedures which was related to the accurate definitive method of ID. Also, an approach for the sequential isotopic analysis of Cd and Zn on the same filament within the TIMS was developed, allowing more rapid analysis and reducing running time on the instrument. Cd and Zn dual analysis on the same filament proved to be successful and produced results comparable to single analysis. Isotopic ratios of Cd and Zn were used to determine both E and L-values in two soils. Although the E-value determined (in soil solution system) was higher than the L-value (using plants) for the 2 soils tested, the 2 values were generally within agreement. L-values were determined using 3 different plant species, the hyperaccumulator alpine penny cress (T. caerulescens), dandelion (T. officinale) and spring barley (H. vulgare). The available pool of Cd and Zn for plant uptake was determined to be the same for the 3 different plant species examined although plant species had markedly different abilities to uptake metals. In addition to using the plant species to estimate the bioavailable metals, the potential of these plant species for phytoremediation of Cd and Zn was also evaluated. Among the plants tested, only T caerulescens proved to be a Cd hyperaccumulator. However, T. officinale removed an equivalent amount of Cd and more of Zn than the other two plant species; although its Cd and Zn content was not sufficiently high to be considered as a hyperaccumulator. Based on this, dandelion has a good potential for phytoremediation, which lead to an attempt to study Cd and Zn uptake in the rhizosphere of dandelion roots. However, the experiment which used soil between glass plates did not show a clear depletion in Cd and Zn concentrations towards the root surface or if metal concentration was related to the amount of root present in any soil section...|$|R
