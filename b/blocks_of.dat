5|$|The kerb-stones {{around the}} tomb display some patterning; {{those on the}} {{northern}} side are mostly rectilinear, while those on the southern side are smaller and largely irregular in shape. It is probable {{that there was an}} ancillary dry-stone wall constructed using <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> ironstone from the geological Folkestone beds, as is evident at Chestnuts Long Barrow. Given that such <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> stone rarely occur naturally, it may have been quarried.|$|E

5|$|As in 1884, the {{election}} {{focused on the}} swing states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana. But unlike that year, when Cleveland had triumphed in all four, in 1888 he won only two, losing {{his home state of}} New York by 14,373 votes. The Republicans won Indiana, largely {{as the result of a}} fraudulent voting practice known as <b>Blocks</b> <b>of</b> Five. Cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to return to private life.|$|E

50|$|For example, a {{block cipher}} {{encryption}} algorithm {{might take a}} 128-bit <b>block</b> <b>of</b> plaintext as input, and output a corresponding 128-bit <b>block</b> <b>of</b> ciphertext. The exact transformation is controlled using a second input - the secret key. Decryption is similar: the decryption algorithm takes, in this example, a 128-bit <b>block</b> <b>of</b> ciphertext together with the secret key, and yields the original 128-bit <b>block</b> <b>of</b> plain text.|$|R
5|$|At State Street, NY38 leaves US20 and NY5 {{and heads}} north through the city's north side, {{crossing}} the Owasco Outlet and serving the Auburn Correctional Facility. The route passes through several <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> {{commercial and residential}} development up to Grant Street, where it begins to taper off. It ceases almost entirely near the northern city line at York Street, where the homes along the highway become more sporadic and spaced apart.|$|E
5|$|Background {{selection}} {{is the opposite}} of a selective sweep. If a specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying selection, linked variation tends to be weeded out along with it, producing a region in the genome of low overall variability. Because background {{selection is}} a result of deleterious new mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it does not produce clear <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> linkage disequilibrium, although with low recombination it can still lead to slightly negative linkage disequilibrium overall.|$|E
5|$|Before 1950, Gulfton {{consisted}} of farm land {{and much of}} the area belonged to Westmoreland Farms. In the mid-1950s, the Shenandoah subdivision was established; consisting of sixteen city <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> ranch-style homes. Shenandoah was located adjacent to the land which would later become the site of the Gulfton apartment complexes. Decades later these communities would clash as the apartments surrounding Shenandoah deteriorated and property values became threatened.|$|E

5|$|Building <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> DNA (adenine, guanine, {{and related}} organic molecules) {{may have been}} formed extraterrestrially in outer space. Complex DNA and RNA organic {{compounds}} of life, including uracil, cytosine, and thymine, have also been formed in the laboratory under conditions mimicking those found in outer space, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar cosmic dust and gas clouds.|$|E
5|$|Decorated rustication. Sebastiano Serlio had {{decorated}} the <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> ashlar in his rustication; {{by the end}} of the 16th century, Sicilian architects were ornamenting the blocks with carvings of leaves, fish-scales, and even sweets and shells; shells were later to become among the most prevalent ornamental symbols of Baroque design. Sometimes the rustication would be used for pillars rather than walls, a reversal of expectations and almost an architectural joke (illustration 2).|$|E

5|$|Dust {{particles}} tend {{to stick}} {{to each other in}} the dense disk environment, leading to the formation of larger particles up to several centimeters in size. The signatures of the dust processing and coagulation are observed in the infrared spectra of the young disks. Further aggregation can lead to the formation of planetesimals measuring 1km across or larger, which are the building <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> planets. Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.|$|E
5|$|For a block {{cellular}} automaton, testing reversibility is also easy: the automaton is reversible if {{and only}} if the transition function on the <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> the automaton is invertible, and in this case the reverse automaton has the same block structure with the inverse transition function.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, {{the display}} was totally renovated. The {{destroyed}} limestone cliff was completely replaced using 130 large <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> Derbyshire limestone, many weighing over , rebuilt {{according to a}} small model made from {{the same number of}} polystyrene blocks. Fibreglass replacements were created for the missing sculptures, and badly damaged parts of the surviving models were recast. For example, some of the animals' legs had been modelled in lead, fixed to the bodies with iron rods; the iron had rusted, splitting the lead open.|$|E
5|$|In {{discrete}} tomography, {{a simplified}} {{version of the}} problem that has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (a subset of the squares in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary image, and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only {{the total number of}} squares, rather than the number and length of the <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> squares. An equivalent version {{of the problem is that}} we must recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.|$|E
