5|$|For a brief period, the Romans were in {{complete}} disarray. Their best armies in the peninsula were destroyed, the few remnants severely demoralized, {{and the only}} remaining consul (Varro) completely discredited. As the story goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as {{there was not a}} single person who was not either related to or acquainted with a person who had died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice burying people alive at the Forum of Rome and abandoning an oversized <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Adriatic Sea (perhaps one of the last instances of human sacrifices by the Romans, apart from public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to Mars).|$|E

40|$|Background : Many of the 15 million {{premature}} {{babies born}} worldwide every year survive because of advanced medical interventions. Their parents have intense experiences when their <b>babies</b> are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{intensive care unit}} (ICU), and these {{have an impact on}} their thoughts, feelings and relationships, including their relationships with their premature babies. Objectives : The aim {{of the study was to}} explore and describe the lived experiences of parents of premature <b>babies</b> <b>in</b> an ICU. Method : Research design was qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual. A purposive sample of parents with premature <b>babies</b> <b>in</b> an ICU in a private hospital in Johannesburg Gauteng in South Africa was used. Eight parents, four mothers and four fathers, married and either Afrikaans or English-speaking, were included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study. Data were collected by conducting in-depth phenomenological interviews with them and making use of field notes. Trustworthiness was ensured by implementing the strategies of credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability. Ethical principles such as autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice were adhered to throughout the research process. Results : Thematic analyses were utilised to analyse the data. Two themes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experiences of parents with premature <b>babies</b> <b>in</b> ICU became apparent. Parents experienced thoughts, emotions and hope while their premature <b>babies</b> were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ICU as well as challenges in their relationships and these challenges influenced their experiences. Recommendations : Mindfulness of intensive care nurses should be facilitated so that intensive care nurses can promote the mental health of parents with premature <b>babies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ICU. Conclusion : Parents with premature <b>babies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ICU have thoughts and emotional experiences which include hope and they affect parents’ relationships...|$|R

25|$|Having {{borrowed}} the large architectural {{setting in the}} Temple of the Presentation, later scenes may show the high priest alone holding the baby, as he or a mohel performs the operation, as in the St Wolfgang altarpiece by Michael Pacher (1481), or Dürer's painting (right) and his influential woodcut from his series on the Life of the Virgin. This reflected what had by then become, and remains, standard Jewish practice, where the ceremony is performed in the synagogue and the baby is held by the seated rabbi as the mohel performs the operation. Such an arrangement is seen in a miniature from a German Pentateuch in Hebrew from about 1300, showing the Circumcision of Isaac. Other depictions show the baby held by Mary or Joseph, or both. Many show another <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background, presumably the next in the queue.|$|E
25|$|The {{moment of}} epiphany comes {{late in the}} play. At the {{beginning}} of Scene III, Oedipus is {{still waiting for the}} servant to be brought into the city, when a messenger arrives from Corinth to declare that King Polybus of Corinth is dead. Oedipus, when he hears this news, feels much relieved, because he believed that Polybus was the father whom the oracle had destined him to murder, and he momentarily believes himself to have escaped fate. He tells this all to the present company, including the messenger, but the messenger knows that it is not true. He is the man who found Oedipus as a <b>baby</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pass of Cithaeron and gave him to King Polybus to raise. He reveals, furthermore that the servant who is being brought to the city as they speak is the very same man who took Oedipus up into the mountains as a baby. Jocasta realizes now all that has happened. She begs Oedipus not to pursue the matter further. He refuses, and she withdraws into the palace as the servant is arriving. The old man arrives, and it is clear at once that he knows everything. At the behest of Oedipus, he tells it all.|$|E

40|$|Confinement {{homes are}} private {{institutions}} that provide full-time care for newborn babies {{and their respective}} postpartum mothers up to one month after delivery. An outbreak of fever and diarrhoea amongst newborns occurred in one such confinement home <b>in</b> Penang between <b>the</b> months of September to October 2004. An outbreak investigation was carried out including all babies, their respective mothers and workers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> home to determine {{the source of the}} outbreak and to institute control measures. Based on a working case definition of febrile illness with or without diarrhoea, 11 out of <b>the</b> 13 <b>babies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> confinement home met the case definition. One hundred percent had symptoms of fever. 36. 4 % had symptoms of diarrhea and other respiratory conditions respectively. The attack rate of among <b>babies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> confinement home was 90 %. Echovirus 11 was isolated from 3 out of the 11 febrile cases. Echovirus 11 was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid and stool of another baby at a private hospital that was epidemiologically linked to <b>the</b> first case. <b>In</b> conclusion, <b>the</b> outbreak of febrile illness amongst newborn <b>babies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affected confinement home was due to echovirus 11. The source was probably health-care associated with efficient transmission within the confinement home. The faecal-oral route was the most likely mode of transmission. KEYWORDS...|$|R
