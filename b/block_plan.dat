Yards are capacitated with respect to number of blocks made and number of cars classified; rail lines between major stations are capacitated with respect to number of cars that pass through. These restrictions are accounted for in designing the <b>blocking</b> <b>plans.</b> Changing the yard locations and expanding associated capacities may result in dramatic changes in <b>blocking</b> <b>plans</b> saving {{tens of millions of dollars}} in railroad transportation costs.

30|$|With <b>blocking</b> <b>plan</b> 1, at {{terminal}} A, {{all three}} commodities are sorted {{to move to}} terminal B. The resulting string (block) of cars may have the commodities intermingled.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{industrial}} application environment considered, different variants of a basic product type are produced {{using the same}} resources and following the same basic process plan.

A block represents a pre-defined sequence of production orders of variable size. In order to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed <b>block</b> <b>planning</b> concept, we consider the production system of a major producer of hair dyes as a case study. We present two different implementations of the <b>block</b> <b>planning</b> concept. One utilizes the Production Planning / Detailed Scheduling module of the SAP APO© software. The other approach is based on a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. In contrast to the academic literature, a continuous representation of time is chosen. Thus the number of variables and constraints could be considerably reduced. The approach suggested is computationally very efficient and provides the flexibility to model a variety of application specific features...|$|R
