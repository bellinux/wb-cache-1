40|$|Biomass is {{considered}} {{as an alternative}} fuel for partial/complete replacement of coal in power generation. The data on coal, agricultural and chemical dusts explosion properties {{are available in the}} literature but reliable data on fibrous biomass is not available. This is because the standard C-tube dispersion system in the 1 m 3 dust explosion vessel does not allow fibrous biomass to flow. In this paper alternative dust dispersion systems (Rebound nozzle, Hemispherical dispersion cup and Spherical grid nozzle) were designed and calibrated against the standard dispersion system using non-fibrous and fibrous dusts. The criterion for the calibration was the achievement of same Pmax, Kst, mass burned (%), flame speed and spherical flame propagation. The ignition delay and inlet air valve off timing were varied using gas explosions to achieve the same turbulence levels in the vessel that produced similar results as with standard system. The calibrated conditions for the rebound nozzle were; 0. 70 s ignition delay and 0. 75 <b>s</b> <b>valve</b> off timing and for spherical grid nozzle were; 0. 50 s ignition delay and 0. 65 <b>s</b> <b>valve</b> off timing. All of the injection systems with an external store of the dust were problematic with fibrous dust and would only pass fibrous dusts milled to < 63 µm and were not suitable for the practical dusts with sizes up to 1 mm that are in current use in power stations burning pulverised biomass. The alternative was to place the dust inside the vessel and to disperse it using a blast of compressed air and the hemispherical cup was developed for this purpose. The hemispherical dispersion cup produced reliable results at 0. 60 s ignition delay and 0. 65 <b>s</b> <b>valve</b> off timing with gas explosions. The dust explosion tests using the hemispherical dispersion cup produced the same results for Pmax and proportion of injected mass burned (%) but had lower values of Kst and flame speed and the flame propagation was shown to not be spherical...|$|R

MethodsThe Perceval <b>S</b> <b>valve</b> (Sorin Biomedica Cardio Srl, Sallugia, Italy), a sutureless implantable aortic bioprosthesis, was used in 32 patients (median age, 78 years; median logistic euroSCORE, 9. 99) requiring aortic valve replacement with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting. Hemodynamic parameters and clinical outcome were obtained at discharge, at 6 months, and up to 1 year postoperatively. ResultsAortic crossclamp time needed for aortic valve replacement was 18 ± 6 minutes. Hemodynamics at discharge showed good function of all Perceval <b>S</b> <b>valves</b> with low transvalvular pressure gradients (mean, 12 ± 5 mm Hg and peak, 23 ± 9 mm Hg) and low incidence of paravalvular or valvular leakage.

40|$|BACKGROUND: {{aortic valve}} {{replacement}} (AVR) {{the most common}} heart valve operation, accounts {{for a majority of}} all valve surgery performed in the elderly. The Perceval S (P) is a new aortic valve which is implanted without suturing, which causes a significant reduction in cross-clamping times (CCTs), and makes valve implantation easier and faster thanks to its collapsed profile. These features potentially allow the pool of operable patients to be expanded, even with minimally invasive surgery in isolated AVRs. AIM: to predict costs and outcomes of AVR procedures associated with this new valve in 4 European countries (Italy, France, Germany, and UK), as compared to traditional (T) valve implants, from the cost perspective of the hospital. METHOD: a probabilistic, patient-level simulation model was fully coded in WinBugs, permitting a seamless integration of parameter estimation and outcomes prediction, which was entirely based on the associated CCTs and on the surgical technique (mini-invasive [MiS] vs. full sternotomy [FS]), through published correlations. Unit cost were retrieved from official and literature sources for all countries. Besides the incorporated probabilistic sensitivity analysis, a series of deterministic sensitivity analyses was performed. RESULTS: the model predicts the use of the Perceval <b>S</b> <b>valve</b> to be associated with less complications and with savings (valve cost excluded), mainly related to a reduction in surgery costs and ICU/hospital bed days. These savings range from € 3, 600 (Italy) to £ 3, 900 (UK) for PFS in isolated AVRs and from about € 6, 000 (Italy) to £ 6, 700 (UK) for PMiS in isolated AVRs, and for PFS in concomitants. Extensive sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of such findings. CONCLUSIONS: {{the results of the present}} analysis indicate that the hospital acquisition cost difference between the new sutureless Perceval <b>S</b> <b>valve</b> and traditional valves is offset by important savings in other cost items. </p...|$|R

Methods and resultsWe reviewed the echocardiographic hemodynamics of 22 cases of TAVIs (group A) and 14 cases of Perceval-AVRs (group B), performed in our centre from April 2010 to June 2012. Preoperative characteristics {{of the two groups}} were comparable. Of the Perceval patients 50 % had concomitant CABG. We performed a comparative analysis of the following echocardiographic variables as in Table (1), assessed by two experienced echocardiographer. The comparative analysis were performed pre-discharge and up to 1 -year follow up. The echocardiographic data showed that the incidence of paravalvular leak (at least mild) was greater in the TAVI group (31. 7 % vs 0 % P=. 005). Valvular incompetence was mild in 5 patients (22 %) in group A and 3 patients (21 %) in group B. There were no differences in terms of average mean trans-prosthetic gradient (9 mmHg vs 13 mmHg, P=. 59) for (group A) and (group B), respectively. Four patients (19 %) in (group A), and one patient (7 %) in (group B) shows a reduction in the Ejection Fraction (EF). However, the EF shows significant improvements in (group B) and no improvement in (group A).

40|$|Aim. Aortic valve {{disease is}} one of three most common {{cardiovascular}} problems. Aortic stenosis is responsible for 70 % of valve disease. Aortic valve replacement is the most effective treatment for aortic stenosis nowadays. A traditional suture technique of aortic valve replacement is associated with a high risk of complications. Most of these complications occur due to ischemic aortic cross-clamp time and comorbidities. Perceval <b>S</b> sutureless aortic <b>valves</b> to be implanted in selected patients are supposed to meet the challenge. The study was aimed at assessing Perceval <b>S</b> sutureless aortic <b>valve</b> hemodynamic and clinical parameters, its intraoperative advantages and postoperative complication rates. Methods. A prospective cohort study of Perceval <b>S</b> sutureless aortic <b>valve</b> implanted via J-sternotomy (n = 22) and median sternotomy (n = 10) was conducted. Early and medium postoperative clinical and functional outcomes were obtained and evaluated. Results. A decrease in the transaortic gradient was observed in early (peak gradient 21. 6 ± 4. 2 (p = 0. 1), mean gradient 11. 3 ± 2. 8 (p = 0. 58)) and medium (peak gradient 15. 8 ± 5. 5 (p = 0. 342), mean gradient 8. 8 ± 1. 9 (p = 0. 54)) follow-up. The myocardial mass index tended to be reduced throughout the entire follow-up (p = 0. 01). There were no prosthesis dysfunctions or biodegradation. No patient died in the postoperative period. Survival at 36 months of follow-up was 93. 75 %. Conclusion. Perceval S xenopericardial sutureless aortic bioprostheses adequately resolve hemodynamic problems and improve left ventricle functional parameters in early and median follow-up. They may be recommended for elderly patients. Sutureless aortic valve implantation is technically feasible through J-sternotomy and contributes to an eventless follow-up. Received 17 February 2017.

Related to the gasket and bearing problems, the assignment also is to nd the reason for the failures and the modi cations needed to avoid these. The components a ected by the changes will be stress analyzed with both hand and computer aided calculations. Lastly a mount will be designed for this speci c valve. The TBV 96 <b>S</b> <b>valve</b> is used for mud and has a problem with leakage between the seat and the ball inside the valve. The reason for the leakage was found to be that the hardness rating of the gasket was to low to handle the corrosion from the hard particles in the mud. This was found through examining the failed valve, and researching the materials used for gaskets. The material that is recommended for further use in the valve is PEEK. The damaged bearings on the stem and trunnion is found to be overloaded from both the work pressure and from the actuator force. A new material is assigned to the bearings, a woven PTFE reinforced and bonded to metal backing from TENMAT called FEROGLIDE. A maximum actuator force is then found through several nite element analysis. Further a mount is designed to counteract the friction torques generated by the gasket and bearings. The mount is designed for simplicity and low cost. It will convert the linear motion from the actuator to a rotational motion on the stem.

The advent of transcatheter valve replacement techniques, by means of percutaneous or transapical approaches, has been recently introduced into mainstream clinical practice and is likely to radically change the treatment of aortic valve disease. At present, further data are needed to thoroughly appraise the long-term risk-benefit balance of transcatheter valve replacement techniques. For this reason, it can only be considered for high surgical risk patients, but early results are so promising that in the future, transcatheter aortic valve implantation could became the first therapeutic choice, even for low-risk patients. © 2010 Future Medicine Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Twenty-seven {{episodes of}} {{bacteremia}} caused by Staphylococcus warneri were identified at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New York between 1984 and 1989. Fourteen {{of these were}} thought to represent true bacteremias and 13 to represent contaminants. Of the 14 true bacteremias, 5 were in pediatric and 9 were in adult patients. Eight of 14 patients (57 %) had catheter-related bacteremia and 5 of 14 had bacteremia of unknown source. There was one case of fulminant native <b>valve</b> <b>S.</b> warneri endocarditis. All cases of catheter-related bacteremia, except one, were nosocomially acquired, and 75 % of these patients had an underlying immunosuppressive condition. Only 40 % of patients with bacteremias of unknown source were immunocompromised, and S. warneri appeared to be noninvasive in this group. Interestingly, all five of the pediatric isolates were oxacillin susceptible, although four of five were resistant to penicillin, despite the fact these patients were hospitalized an average of 29 days. In contrast, seven of nine adult isolates were resistant to both oxacillin and penicillin. The only case of native <b>valve</b> <b>S.</b> warneri endocarditis occurred in a patient who had no known underlying valvular heart disease, but had an underlying immunosuppressive condition. Identification to species level of coagulase-negative staphylococci may lead to appreciation {{of the importance of}} bacteria such as S. warneri as human pathogens...|$|R

40|$|Stentless valves {{were greeted}} {{as a great}} step forward for the {{replacement}} of diseased aortic valves, particularly aortic <b>valve</b> <b>s</b> ten osis i n t he e lde rly. In 19 88, Ti rone Da vid developed a stentless xenograft (Toronto Stentless Porcine bioprosthesis) aimed to improve hemodynamics, valve durabi lity, a nd pati ent survi val [1]. This stent less valve truly resembles a human aortic valve, with cusps, commissures, and aortic wall posts. The lack of a frame greatly improves functional performance by diminishing postoperative transvalvular gradient, thus favoring regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and enhancing cardiac electrical stability. Recent study has confirmed that low gradients and large effective orif ice area are mai ntained at nine years after implant atio...|$|R
40|$|Using two servohydraulic actuators, each {{capable of}} {{generating}} 40 tons of force, high-level simulated seismic tests {{were performed on}} an in-plant piping system. The purpose of these experiments was to study the behavior of piping subjected to seismic excitation levels that exceed design levels manyfold and may result in failure/plastification of pipe supports and pipe elements, and to establish seismic margins for piping and pipe supports. The performance of six different dynamic pipe support systems was evaluated and the response, operability, and fragility of dynamic supports and of a typical U. <b>S.</b> gate <b>valve</b> were investigated. Data obtained in the tests are used to validate analysis methods. Preliminary evaluations of the test results lead to the observation that, in general, failures of dynamic supports (in particular snubbers) occur only at load levels that substantially exceed the design capacity. Pipe strains at load levels exceeding the design level threefold are quite small, an d even when exceeding the design level eightfold are quite tolerable. Hence, under seismic loading, even at extreme levels {{and in spite of}} multiple support failures, pipe failure is unlikely. Comparisons of linear pretest calculations with experimental data indicate that computed results may be nonconservative, underpredicting, in particular, peak dynamic-support forces...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of Staphylococcus aureus adhesins in Lactococcus lactis identified clumping factor A (ClfA) and fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA) as critical for valve colonization in rats with experimental endocarditis. This study further analyzed {{their role in}} disease evolution. Infected animals were followed for 3 d. ClfA-positive lactococci successfully colonized damaged valves, but were spontaneously eradicated over 48 h. In contrast, FnBPA-positive lactococci progressively increased bacterial titers in vegetations and spleens. At imaging, ClfA-positive lactococci were restricted to the vegetations, whereas FnBPA-positive lactococci also invaded the adjacent endothelium. This reflected the capacity of FnBPA to trigger cell internalization in vitro. Because FnBPA carries both fibrinogen- and fibronectin-binding domains, we tested the role of these functionalities by deleting the fibrinogen-binding domain of FnBPA and supplementing it with the fibrinogen-binding domain of ClfA in cis or in trans. Deletion of the fibrinogen-binding domain of FnBPA did not alter fibronectin binding and cell internalization in vitro. However, it totally abrogated valve infectivity in vivo. This ability was restored in cis by inserting the fibrinogen-binding domain of ClfA into truncated FnBPA, and in trans by coexpressing full-length ClfA and truncated FnBPA on two separate plasmids. Thus, fibrinogen and fibronectin binding could cooperate for <b>S.</b> aureus <b>valve</b> colonization and endothelial invasion in vivo...|$|R
40|$|In {{the work}} {{the results of}} tests on 50 H 21 G 9 N 4 and H 9 <b>S</b> 2 <b>valve</b> steels with pad welded {{stellite}} layers are presented. Basic properties such as tribological and erosion resistance as well as high temperature oxidation resistance were determined. Testing conditions were accepted with certain simplification owing {{to the complexity of}} mechanical and thermal load exhaust valves and, therefore, they do not reflect real operating conditions accurately. Specimens with and without laser, plasma and TIG pad welded stellite layers were subject to tests. The conducted tests showed the highest tribological resistance of stellite layers under the conditions of dry friction in comparison with the material in the initial state as well as plasma and TIG pad welded stellite layers. The main mechanism of the abrasive wear of the surface layer is an adhesive wear by breaking the connections and adhesions that are being formed. The research on wear by abrasive erosion showed a smaller decrease in the mass of specimens with pad welded stellite layers in comparison with plasma and TIG pad welded stellite layers as well as the material in the initial form without the pad welded stellite layer. The resistance of stellite layers to high temperature oxidation was showed in the research on heat resistance. Moreover, it was found that pad welding does not have any significant influence on the heat resistance of stellite layers...|$|R
