25|$|Many new {{intravenous}} and inhalational anesthetics {{were developed}} and brought into clinical {{use during the}} second half of the 20th century. Paul Janssen (1926–2003), the founder of Janssen Pharmaceutica, is credited with the development of over 80 pharmaceutical compounds. Janssen synthesized nearly all of the <b>butyrophenone</b> class of antipsychotic agents, beginning with haloperidol (1958) and droperidol (1961). These agents were rapidly integrated into the practice of anesthesia. In 1960, Janssen's team synthesized fentanyl, the first of the piperidinone-derived opioids. Fentanyl was followed by sufentanil (1974), alfentanil (1976), carfentanil (1976), and lofentanil (1980). Janssen and his team also developed etomidate (1964), a potent intravenous anesthetic induction agent.|$|E
25|$|Haloperidol is {{a typical}} <b>butyrophenone</b> type {{antipsychotic}} that exhibits high affinity dopamine D2 receptor antagonism and slow receptor dissociation kinetics. It has effects similar to the phenothiazines. The drug binds preferentially to D2 and α1 receptors at low dose (ED50 = 0.13 and 0.42mg/kg, respectively), and 5-HT2 receptors at a higher dose (ED50 = 2.6mg/kg). Given that antagonism of D2 receptors is more beneficial on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and antagonism of 5-HT2 receptors on the negative symptoms, this characteristic underlies haloperidol's greater effect on delusions, hallucinations and other manifestations of psychosis. Haloperidol's negligible affinity for histamine H1 receptors and muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptors yields an antipsychotic with a lower incidence of sedation, weight gain, and orthostatic hypotension though having higher rates of treatment emergent extrapyramidal symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|Risperidone {{has been}} {{classified}} as a [...] "qualitatively atypical" [...] antipsychotic agent with a relatively low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (when given at low doses) that has more pronounced serotonin antagonism than dopamine antagonism. Risperidone contains the functional groups of benzisoxazole and piperidine {{as part of its}} molecular structure. Although not a <b>butyrophenone,</b> it was developed with the structures of benperidol and ketanserin as a basis. It has actions at several 5-HT (serotonin) receptor subtypes. These are 5-HT2C, linked to weight gain, 5-HT2A, linked to its antipsychotic action and relief of some of the extrapyramidal side effects experienced with the typical neuroleptics.|$|E

40|$|Psychomotor {{excitation}} {{is seen in}} precomatous {{states and}} in the first stages of coma. Three groups of psychomotor disturbances are distinguished in coma: one due to pain and discomfort, another showing confusion with disorientation and possibly hallucinations and a third due to physical and physiological discomfort. In all conditions treatment is primarily causative after the proper diagnosis has been established and psychomotor excitation will often give a diagnostic clue since it may point either to the primary lesion (intracranial hematoma for example) or to complications (dehydration, irritation of the larynx during intubation). Supportive drug treatment includes: phenothiazines, <b>butyrophenones</b> and benzodiazepines in precoma, analgesics in group 1 conditions, benzodiazepines, perphenazines and <b>butyrophenones</b> in the confusional and hallucinatory states and occasionally when indicated benzodiazepines and analgesics in patients with physical and physiological discomfort.

50|$|NMS {{is usually}} caused by {{antipsychotic}} drug use, {{and a wide}} range of drugs can result in NMS. Individuals using <b>butyrophenones</b> (such as haloperidol and droperidol) or phenothiazines (such as promethazine and chlorpromazine) are reported to be at greatest risk. However, various atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone have also been implicated in cases.|$|R

50|$|About 7% {{of people}} with parkinsonism have {{developed}} their symptoms following treatment with particular medications. Side effect of medications, mainly neuroleptic antipsychotics especially the phenothiazines (such as perphenazine and chlorpromazine), thioxanthenes (such as flupenthixol and zuclopenthixol) and <b>butyrophenones</b> (such as haloperidol), piperazines (such as ziprasidone), and rarely, antidepressants. The incidence of drug-induced parkinsonism increases with age. Drug-induced parkinsonism tends to remain at its presenting level, not progress like Parkinson's disease.|$|R
40|$|Metoclopramide is an {{antiemetic}} drug which occasionally produced acute dystonic reactions. Although {{known to}} interfere with central dopamine mechanisms, it is frequently used in Parkinson's disease to prevent levodopa-induced nausea and vomiting. In this study metoclopramide did not increase Parkinsonism or reduce levodopa-induced involuntary movements in patients with Parkinson's disease. Pimozide, by contrast, increased Parkinsonism and reduced involuntary movements. The capacity of metoclopramide to produce acute dyskinesias while being apparently free of Parkinsonism effects is pharmacologically unique and differentiates this drug from the phenothiazines and <b>butyrophenones...</b>|$|R
50|$|Increased {{levels of}} {{dopamine}} {{have long been}} implicated {{in the development of}} schizophrenia. However, much debate continues to this day surrounding this dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. Despite the controversy, dopamine antagonists remain a standard and successful treatment for schizophrenia. These antagonists include first generation (typical) antipsychotics such as <b>butyrophenones,</b> phenothiazines, and thioxanthenes. These drugs have largely been replaced by second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics such as clozapine and paliperidone. It should be noted that, in general, these drugs do not act on dopamine-producing neurons themselves, but on the receptors on the post-synaptic neuron.|$|R
50|$|Melperone (Bunil (PT), Buronil (AT, BE, CZ, DK, FL†, NL†, NO†, SE), Eunerpan (DE)) is an {{atypical}} antipsychotic of the <b>butyrophenone</b> chemical class, {{making it}} structurally {{related to the}} typical antipsychotic haloperidol. It first entered clinical use in 1960s.|$|E
50|$|If the N-methyl {{group in}} MPTP is {{replaced}} by a <b>butyrophenone,</b> one gets Phenoperidone. One of the theories why the related drug haloperidol is capable of causing pseudo-Parkinson syndrome is because it is metabolized to a pyridinium-quationic like species in vivo.|$|E
50|$|Fentanyl/fluanisone (trade name Hypnorm) is a {{veterinary}} combination drug {{consisting of}} fentanyl (a potent synthetic narcotic analgesic with a rapid onset and short duration of action) and fluanisone (a typical antipsychotic and sedative of the <b>butyrophenone</b> class) {{for use in}} mice, rats, rabbits and guinea pigs.|$|E
5000|$|Typical {{antipsychotics}} are a {{class of}} antipsychotic drugs first developed in the 1950s and used to treat psychosis (in particular, schizophrenia). Typical antipsychotics may {{also be used for}} the treatment of acute mania, agitation, and other conditions. The first typical antipsychotics to come into medical use were the phenothiazines, namely chlorpromazine which was discovered serendipitously. Another prominent grouping of antipsychotics are the <b>butyrophenones,</b> an example of which would be haloperidol. The newer, second-generation antipsychotics, also known as atypical antipsychotics, have replaced the typical antipsychotics due to the Parkinson-like side effects typicals have.|$|R
50|$|A {{group of}} drugs called the phenothiazines, {{including}} antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine, {{has been found}} to antagonize dopamine binding (particularly at receptors known as D2 dopamine receptors) and reduce positive psychotic symptoms. This observation was subsequently extended to other antipsychotic drug classes, such as <b>butyrophenones</b> including haloperidol. The link was strengthened by experiments in the 1970s which suggested that the binding affinity of antipsychotic drugs for D2 dopamine receptors seemed to be inversely proportional to their therapeutic dose. This correlation, suggesting that receptor binding is causally related to therapeutic potency, was reported by two laboratories in 1976.|$|R
40|$|Phenothiazines and <b>butyrophenones</b> {{are known}} to alter {{dopamine}} (3, 4 -dihydroxyphenethylamine) metabolism in the brain in a fashion suggesting that they may block dopamine receptors. We observed, using Dreiding molecular models, that dopamine in its solid-state conformation is superimposable upon {{a portion of the}} known x-ray structure of chlorpromazine [2 -chloro- 10 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) -phenothiazine]. The ability of phenothiazine drugs to mimic the dopamine-like conformation correlates with their antischizophrenic efficacy.

Additionally, spiperone was identified by compound screening to be an activator of Ca2+ activated Cl− channels (CaCCs), thus a potential target for therapy of cystic fibrosis.|$|E
50|$|Trifluperidol is {{a typical}} {{antipsychotic}} of the <b>butyrophenone</b> chemical class.

40|$|Schizophrenia is {{characterized}} by three major symptom class-es: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive def-icits. Classical antipsychotics (phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and <b>butyrophenones)</b> are effective against positive symptoms but induce major side effects, in particular, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). The discovery of clozapine, which does not induce EPS and is thought effective against all three classes of symptom, has driven research for novel antipsychotics with a wider activity spectrum and lower EPS liability. To increase predictiveness, current efforts aim to develop translational models where direct parallels can be drawn between the pro-cesses studied in animals and in humans.
