5|$|The {{postwar period}} saw {{considerable}} deflation; {{the shortage of}} labor and materials during the war had led to much higher wages and prices, and in the postwar economic readjustment, wages were cut heavily. In Chicago, employers in the building trades attempted a 20%wage cut; when this {{was rejected by the}} unions, a lockout followed. Both sides agreed to submit the matter to a neutral arbitrator, and settled on Landis, who agreed to take the case in June 1921. By this time, Landis was Commissioner of Baseball, and still a federal judge. In September, Landis issued his report, cutting wages by an average of 12.5%. To improve productivity, he also struck restrictions on machinery which saved labor, established a standardized overtime rate, and resolved jurisdictional conflicts between unions. The labor organizations were not completely satisfied, but Landis's reforms were adopted in many places across the country and were credited with reviving the <b>building</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E

In 1973, John Lindsay, who had become a Democrat, withdrew from the New York Plan, setting a new objective to increase minority representation in the building trades to twenty five per cent.|$|E
25|$|Copper’s higher tensile {{strength}} (200–250 N/mm2 annealed) compared to aluminium (100 N/mm2 for typical conductor alloys) {{is another reason}} why copper is used extensively in the <b>building</b> <b>industry.</b> Copper’s high strength resists stretching, neck-down, creep, nicks and breaks, and thereby also prevents failures and service interruptions. Copper is much heavier than aluminum for conductors of equal current carrying capacity, so the high {{tensile strength}} is offset by its increased weight.|$|E

25|$|Peter Brennan {{returned}} to his union position in March 1975 and retired in 1992.

The F25Ts were fitted with Western engines and armament, and their construction was supervised by technical advisers from the German ship <b>building</b> <b>industry.</b> Sonars on these F25Ts are SO-7H, which is the Chinese version of French DUBA25.|$|E
