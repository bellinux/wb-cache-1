50|$|A {{reinforced}} <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> in {{the early}} 1900s consisted of a plain straight steel {{in the center of}} a molded concrete form. The beam would fail along the lines of principal stresses in the concrete through shearing. The plain straight steel was placed into an encased mold and concrete was poured in. This formulated mixture of steel and concrete then hardened and became the reinforced <b>beam</b> <b>bar.</b> However, in some cases there was a tiny air gap between the steel and the hardened concrete which allowed the steel to move and slip. This weakened the reinforced beam from its original full strength capability. This meant then this weakened fractured beam could fail and break under the heavy load of the building it was supporting.|$|E

40|$|The seismic {{assessment}} {{of an existing}} reinforced concrete building designed to pre- 1970 s codes during a major earthquake focuses on investigating the global post-elastic responses of the building. The global post-elastic response of a reinforced concrete building can be studied based on the local post-elastic behaviour of the individual structural components. In this study, simulated seismic loading tests were conducted on as-built reinforced concrete beam-column joint sub assemblages {{in order to obtain}} the information on the post-elastic behaviour of as-built reinforced concrete components. Simulated seismic loading tests included two as-built full-scale interior beam-column joint units, four as-built full-scale exterior beam - column joint units and one retrofitted as-built exterior beam-column joint unit. The as-built test units contained the plain round longitudinal reinforcement and had the reinforcing details typical of an existing reinforced concrete structure constructed in the late 1950 s in New Zealand. The two as-built interior beam-column joint units, Unit 1 and Unit 2, were identical. Unit 1 was tested with zero column axial load and Unit 2 was tested with a compressive column axial load of 0. 12 Agfc'. According to the current codes, the two as-built interior beam-column joint units would develop premature shear failure in the joints, beams and columns. Both units when tested showed that, unlike the conclusion reached by the theoretical assessment using the current code method, the premature shear failure was precluded in the joint and members of the test units. For both units, the post-elastic behaviour of the reinforced concrete components was limited to the fixed-ends at the beam-column interfaces of the members, and it was {{in the form of a}} major flexural crack at the beam-column interfaces. Due to the plain round longitudinal reinforcement used, severe bond slip along the plain round longitudinal reinforcement occurred within and adjacent to the joint, resulting in significantly degrading flexural behaviour at the beam column interfaces of the members. For both units tested, the available structural stiffness and strength were low, especially the stiffness, and the degradation of the stiffness and strength was significant. Column bar buckling was also apparent, especially when the compressive axial load was present in the column. The four as-built exterior beam-column joint units, Units EJ 1 to EJ 4, were identical except for the <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> hook details in the exterior columns. Identical units EJ 1 and EJ 3 had the <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> hooks bent away from the joint cores. Identical units EJ 2 and EJ 4 had the <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> hooks bent away from the joint cores. Units EJ 1 and EJ 2 were tested with zero column axial load but Units EJ 3 and EJ 4 were tested with a compressive column axial load of about O. 25 Agfc' present. The retrofitted unit was the original as-built unit EJ 1 with the <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> hooks bent away from the joint core, and the retrofit was achieved by wrapping the column areas immediately above and below the joint core using fibre-glass after tested to test an alternative force path across the joint core. According to the current code method, the premature shear failure would occur in the joint of Unit EJ 1 and in the beams of all the four as-built exterior beam-column joint units. Examination of the member force transfer across the joint showed that effective column transverse confinement within the <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> hook range was critical in restraining the opening of the <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> hooks and actuating the force transfer across the joint core, and an alternative force path across the joint core, in the case of the <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> hooks bent away from the joint core in the exterior columns, could be actuated if sufficient column confinement above and below the joint core was available. The as-built units when tested with zero axial column load demonstrated very poor force strength and stiffness behaviour. The final failures were dominated by the concrete tension cracking along the outer layer of column main bars adjacent to the joint core, which was initiated by the interaction between the opening of the <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> hooks and the column bar buckling, irrespective of the <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> hook details. The configuration of the <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> hooks bent into the joint core was found to result in better seismic performance compared to that with the <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> hooks bent away from the joint core in the case of zero axial column load and small amount of column transverse reinforcement provided. The as-built units when tested with constant compressive axial column load of about 0. 25 Agfc’; present demonstrated that the presence of compressive axial column load totally prevented the concrete tension cracking along the <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> hooks, and the post-elastic behaviour of the test units was limited to the fixed-ends of the beams, in the form of a big beam fixed-end rotation. Generally, the compressive column axial load greatly improved the overall stiffness and force strength of the units. In this case the effects of different <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> hook details on the seismic performance of the as-built exterior beam-column joint units became very insignificant. The test on the retrofitted as-built unit showed that fibre-glass jacketing in the column areas adjacent to the joint core restrained the opening of the <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> hook and actuated the postulated alternative the force transfer path across the joint when the axial column load was low, leading to much improved stiffness and force strength performance. Overall, for the as-built reinforced concrete members reinforced by plain round longitudinal reinforcement, the post-elastic seismic behaviour was governed by the degrading flexural behaviour at the member fixed-end at the beam-column interfaces, in the form of big fixed-end rotations. A rotational ductility factor at the fixed-end, rather than a curvature ductility factor associated with a plastic hinge length, became a more useful index to the member post-elastic flexural deformation. Member flexural strength and stiffness were lower than the theoretical estimations, and they were significantly influenced by the force transfer mechanism across the joint core. Typically, the compressive column axial load at the same joint resulted in much improved flexural behaviour at the beam fixed-end. Based on the test evidence, a method was tentatively proposed for allowing for the beneficial effect on the member flexural behaviour at the fixed-end of the compressive axial load on the transverse members at the same joint. After obtaining the information on the post-elastic behaviour of as-built structural components, non-linear static and dynamic analyses were conducted for the subject building represented by the as-built test units. The non-linear static analysis showed that the earthquake-resisting capacity of similar structures do not satisfy the current design code requirements, a failure mechanism was very unlikely to form and the local member deformation capacity limited the structural performance during a major earthquake. No structural ductility can be relied on and the structural assessment has to be based on elastic response. Allowance for the masonry infills meant that the structural earthquake-resistant capacity was more inadequate. In this case, a soft storey failure mechanism could form, no ductility can be relied on. The non-linear dynamic analysis conducted for the subject building showed that similar existing reinforced concrete structures would survive during an earthquake with similar characteristics and magnitudes to the 1940 El Centro NS record...|$|E

If the top reinforcement area (A_s,top) exceeds the bottom reinforcement area (A_s,bot) at a beam-column joint, relatively larger flexural compression would be {{developed at the}} bottom beam ends in order to balance the greater flexural tension developed from the top <b>beam</b> <b>bars</b> at the same section. Thus, the compressive stress of the bottom <b>beam</b> <b>bars</b> at the joint face would be {{greater than that of}} the top <b>beam</b> <b>bars</b> at the opposite face.

3000|$|For {{a common}} beam {{reinforcement}} ratio of A_s,bot /A_s,top< 0.75 and overstrength factor α_o = 1. 2 5, {{the outcomes of}} the stress gradient factor α_s = ([...] 1 + κ) for bottom beam bars are equal to 2.0 per AIJ (2010), 1.75 per Eurocode 8 (CEN 2004), 1.80 per NZS 3101 (2006), 1.75 per Brooke and Ingham (2013), and 1.64 per Li and Leong (2015). Notably, the bar compressive stress κα_o f_y is unlikely to reach α_o f_y as for the tensile stress, because of the limited compressive strain of the <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> in the flexural compression zone at the beam ends.

40|$|Reversed cyclic-load {{tests are}} carried out on {{full-scale}} reinforced concrete (RC) exterior beam-column joints, which are fabricated to simulate those in as-built RC framed buildings designed to BS 8110. Emphasis {{of the study is}} placed on the effects of the types of <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> anchorage and location of laps in column reinforcement on the seismic behaviour and shear strength of RC exterior joints subjected to simulated earthquake load. The behaviour is investigated with different types of anchorage in beam reinforcement and laps in column bars at the lower zone of the column.

The test results are compared with two preseismic design codes (BS. 8110 and EC 2) and two seismic design codes (ACI- 318 and NZS 3101). It is shown that the types of reinforcement anchorage in beams have significant effects on the shear capacity and hysteretic behaviour of exterior beam-column joints. Present codes of practice do not accurately predict the shear strength of the non-seismically detailed joints.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the cyclic responses of eight reinforced concrete exterior beam-column joints, namely, four concentric and four eccentric joints, which {{are subjected to}} in-plane lateral displacement reversals. The specimen variables are joint eccentricity, joint aspect ratio, and anchorage of the beam bars terminating within the joint. Four joints used traditional reinforcement for the beam longitudinal bars with standard 90 -degree hooks anchored in the joint. The other four connections used headed reinforcement consisting of screw-deformed bars and mechanical anchorage devices to improve the anchorage of the beam bars, the constructability of steel cages, and the seismic performance of connections. Performance of the beam-column joints are evaluated and compared with each other. The behavior of joints with mechanical anchorage devices are as good as, or better than those companion joints with 90 -degree hooks. Use of double mechanical devices could avoid push-out failure of the <b>beam</b> <b>bar</b> embedded in the joint, and further improve the ductility and energy dissipation capacity. Joint eccentricity between the beam and column centerlines had {{detrimental effects on the}} seismic performance of beam-column joints. Current ACI design produces for estimating the nominal joint shear strength are not capable of preventing the test joints from shear failure at large drift levels. Rather than ACI traditional cross-sectional approach, the proposed strut-and-tie modeling agreed better with the test results.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on the behaviour of soils {{is a crucial}} problem in geothermal engineering as soils are subjected to the action of temperature variation in many diverse conditions. It is observed in both laboratory experiments and in situ tests that temperature variations can induce interaction between the thermal, hydraulic and mechanical behaviour of soils, which is known as thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) coupling. In order to simulate the THM coupling, {{it is necessary to}} combine the equations governing heat transfer through the soil mass with the equations governing pore fluid flow through the soil skeleton, and the equations governing the stress-strain behaviour of the soil. Due to the complexities of the governing equations, the finite element (FE) method has been regarded as an appropriate numerical tool to solve THM coupled problems. In this thesis, all of the research has been carried out using the Imperial College Finite Element Program (ICFEP), which has been developed specifically for geotechnical engineering analysis. This thesis develops the governing equations for THM coupled analysis. It then describes the implementation of these equations for fully saturated soils in ICFEP. This theory has been applied to all types of elements in ICFEP, such as solid, <b>beam,</b> <b>bar,</b> joint, membrane and shell elements. Thermal boundary conditions relevant to geotechnical engineering have also been developed and implemented into ICFEP. A series of validation tests on the new facilities has been performed, and the results have been compared to those obtained using analytical and finite difference methods. To avoid numerical oscillations, the time-step constraints in coupled transient FE analyses, as well as an adequate mesh discretisation in highly convective coupled analysis, have been investigated. The findings from the analytical and numerical studies have been applied to a simulation of an open-loop ground source energy system, and the results show an excellent agreement with the available approximate solution.

3000|$|More recently, Hwang et al. (2014) {{conducted}} {{cyclic loading}} tests of three cruciform beam-column joints made with Grade 600  MPa am bars and 32  MPa concrete. The column depths ranged from 20 d_b to 25 d_b, {{which is less}} than 29 d_b required by Eq. (1). The test results exhibited very pinched hysteresis behavior due to excessive slip of <b>beam</b> <b>bars</b> in the joint core.

In practice, higher grade reinforcement is used together with high-strength concrete, particularly for columns with limited architectural dimensions and high axial load at {{the lower levels of}} high-rise buildings (Aoyama 2001).

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} structures {{designed in}} pre- 1970 s are vulnerable under earthquakes {{due to lack}} of seismic detailing to provide adequate ductility. Typical deficiencies of pre- 1970 s reinforced concrete structures are (a) use of plain bars as longitudinal reinforcement, (b) inadequate anchorage of beam longitudinal reinforcement in the column (particularly exterior column), (c) lack of joint transverse reinforcement if any, (d) lapped splices located just above joint, and (e) low concrete strength. Furthermore, the use of infill walls is a controversial issue because it can help to provide additional stiffness to the structure on the positive side and on the negative side it can increase the possibility of soft-storey mechanisms if it is distributed irregularly. Experimental research to investigate the possible seismic behaviour of pre- 1970 s reinforced concrete structures have been carried out in the past. However, there is still an absence of experimental tests on the 3 -D response of existing beam-column joints under bi-directional cyclic loading, such as corner joints. As part of the research work herein presented, a series of experimental tests on beam-column subassemblies with typical detailing of pre- 1970 s buildings has been carried out to investigate the behaviour of existing reinforced concrete structures. Six two-third scale plane frame exterior beam-column joint subassemblies were constructed and tested under quasi-static cyclic loading in the Structural Laboratory of the University of Canterbury. The reinforcement detailing and beam dimension were varied to investigate their effect on the seismic behaviour. Four specimens were conventional deep beam-column joint, with two of them using deformed longitudinal <b>bars</b> and <b>beam</b> <b>bars</b> bent in to the joint and the two others using plain round longitudinal <b>bars</b> and <b>beam</b> <b>bars</b> with end hooks. The other two specimens were shallow beam-column joint, one with deformed longitudinal <b>bars</b> and <b>beam</b> <b>bars</b> bent in to the joint, the other with plain round longitudinal <b>bars</b> and <b>beam</b> <b>bars</b> with end hooks. All units had one transverse reinforcement in the joint. The results of the experimental tests indicated that conventional exterior beam-column joint with typical detailing of pre- 1970 s building would experience serious diagonal tension cracking in the joint panel under earthquake. The use of plain round bars with end hooks for beam longitudinal reinforcement results in more severe damage in the joint core when compared to the use of deformed <b>bars</b> for <b>beam</b> longitudinal reinforcement bent in to the joint, due to the combination of bar slips and concrete crushing. One interesting outcome is that the use of shallow beam in the exterior beam-column joint could avoid the joint cracking due to the beam size although the strength provided lower when compared with the use of deep beam with equal moment capacity. Therefore, taking into account the low strength and stiffness, shallow beam can be reintroduced as an alternative solution in design process. In addition, the presence of single transverse reinforcement in the joint core can provide additional confinement after the first crack occurred, thus delaying the strength degradation of the structure. Three two-third scale space frame corner beam-column joint subassemblies were also constructed to investigate the biaxial loading effect. Two specimens were deep-deep beam-corner column joint specimens and the other one was deep-shallow beam-corner column joint specimen. One deep-deep beam-corner column joint specimen was not using any transverse reinforcement in the joint core while the two other specimens were using one transverse reinforcement in the joint core. Plain round longitudinal bars were used for all units with hook anchorage for the <b>beam</b> <b>bars.</b> Results from the tests confirmed the evidences from earthquake damage observations with the exterior 3 -D (corner) beam-column joint subjected to biaxial loading would have less strength and suffer higher damage in the joint area under earthquake. Furthermore, the joint shear relation in the two directions is calibrated from the results to provide better analysis. An analytical model was used to simulate the seismic behaviour of the joints with the help of Ruaumoko software.
