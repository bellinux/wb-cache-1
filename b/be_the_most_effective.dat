5|$|Operation Weserübung {{began on}} 9 April 1940 with the invasions of Norway and Denmark, Denmark capitulated within the day whilst Norway {{continued}} to resist with British and French help. The campaign {{was not a}} Blitzkrieg of fast-moving armoured divisions supported by air power as the mountainous terrain ruled out close Panzer/Stuka cooperation. Instead, the Germans relied on paratroops, airborne troops transported by Junkers Ju 52s and specialised ski troops. The Ju 87s were given the role of ground attack and anti-shipping missions. The Ju 87 proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> weapon in the Luftwaffe's armoury carrying out the latter task.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, von Neumann {{became a}} {{commissioner}} of the AEC. He accepted this position {{and used it to}} further the production of compact hydrogen bombs suitable for Intercontinental ballistic missile delivery. He involved himself in correcting the severe shortage of tritium and lithium 6 needed for these compact weapons, and he argued against settling for the intermediate range missiles that the Army wanted. He was adamant that H-bombs delivered into the heart of enemy territory by an ICBM would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> weapon possible, and that the relative inaccuracy of the missile wouldn't be a problem with an H-bomb. He said the Russians would probably be building a similar weapon system, {{which turned out to be}} the case. Despite his disagreement with Oppenheimer over the need for a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, he testified on the latter's behalf at the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing, at which he asserted that Oppenheimer was loyal, and praised him for his helpfulness once the program went ahead.|$|E
5|$|The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a {{landmark}} piece of federal {{legislation in the}} United States that prohibits racial discrimination in voting. It {{was signed into law}} by President Lyndon B. Johnson {{during the height of the}} Civil Rights Movement on August 6, 1965, and Congress later amended the Act five times to expand its protections. Designed to enforce the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Act secured voting rights for racial minorities throughout the country, especially in the South. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Act is considered to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> piece of federal civil rights legislation ever enacted in the country.|$|E
