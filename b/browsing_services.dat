It is shown how museums with their semantically rich and interrelated collection content {{can create a}} large, consolidated semantic collection portal together on the web. By sharing a set of ontologies, {{it is possible to}} make collections semantically interoperable, and provide the museum visitors with intelligent content-based search and <b>browsing</b> <b>services</b> to the global collection base. The architecture underlying MUSEUMFINLAND separates generic search and <b>browsing</b> <b>services</b> from the underlying application dependent schemas and metadata by a layer of logical rules. As a result, the portal creation framework and software developed has been applied successfully to other domains as well. MUSEUMFINLAND got the Semantic Web Challence Award (second prize) in 2004.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{enormous}} {{growth in the}} usage of web <b>browsing</b> <b>services</b> on the Internet. The prime reason behind this usage is the widespread availability of World Wide Web (WWW), which has enabled users to easily utilize different content types such as e-mail, e-commerce, online news, social media and video streaming services by just deploying a web browser on their platform. However, the delivery of these content types often suffers from the delays due to sudden disturbances in networks, resulting in the increased waiting time for the users. As a consequence of this, the user Quality of Experience (QoE) may drop significantly. Therefore, {{in order to provide}} successful network services, it is important {{to assess the impact of}} network disturbances on the Web browsing QoE.

40|$|Abstract—An {{important}} privacy {{issue in}} Location Based Services (LBS) is {{to hide a}} user’s identity and location while still providing quality location based services. A user’s identity can be easily hidden through anonymous web <b>browsing</b> <b>services.</b> However, a user’s location can reveal a user’s identity. For example, a user at home may want to ask queries such as “Find the nearest hospital around me ” through a GPS enabled mobile phone but {{he may not be}} willing to dislose his own location. A common way to achieve location privacy is through cloaking, e. g. the client sends a cloaked region to the server and filters the results to find the exact answer. Recently, Private Information Retrieval has been adopted to answer private location-based queries. However, we argue that ensuring the server does not reveal more data than what is queried is important at the same time. In this paper, we propose an efficient two-level solution based on two cryptographic protocols: PIR and Oblivious Transfer. Our solution is a generalpurpose one and can use either a two-level PIR [2] or it can use a combination of PIR and Oblivious Transfer [11]. Our approach provides privacy for the user/client, does not use a trusted party or anonymizer, is provably privacy-preserving, and when compared to previous approaches ensures that the server reveals as minimum data as is required, and the data that is released by the server is as fine-grained or precise as possible.

40|$|Next {{generation}} {{high performance}} systems are being standardised assuming a generic service delivery paradigm capable of supporting {{a diversity of}} circuit and importantly packet services. However, this flexibility comes at a cost which is the increased complexity of the dimensioning, planning, optimisation and QoS provisioning with respect to previous generation single-service mobile systems. Accurate system dimensioning is of fundamental importance and this thesis explores this requirement at two levels. Firstly, it departs from the common assumption of static users and examines what {{is the impact of}} mobile users on the system capacity. Secondly, it examines the impact of voice and web <b>browsing</b> <b>services</b> on the system dimensioning. In spite of the accuracy of dimensioning and planning, load imbalances occur for different reasons, which result in small-scale congestion events in the system. A load equalisation scheme is proposed which utilises the overlapping areas between neighbouring cells in order to eliminate the load imbalances. Essentially, coverage overlapping is needed in order to achieve ubiquitous coverage, hence to eliminate coverage holes. However, excessive overlapping results in capacity loss in interference-limited systems which is virtually the case with all modern systems. Radio coverage optimisation is needed but today this is performed on a cell-by- cell basis producing sub-optimal results. This thesis proposes an advanced coverage optimisation algorithm which takes into consideration simultaneously all cells within the considered area. For the operators (and also the proposed coverage optimisation algorithm) it is Imperative to have accurate path loss predictions. However, contemporary planning tools come with certain limitations, and often time-consuming and expensive measurement campaigns are organised. This thesis builds on the assumption that mobile systems will be able to locate the position of mobile terminals and subsequently proposes an automated process for the estimation of the radio coverage of the network. Lastly, the assumption regarding the positioning capabilities of the mobile systems Is further exploited in order to enhance the QoS guarantees to mobile users. Thus, various algorithms are examined which perform handovers towards base stations which maximise the survivability of the handed over calls...|$|E

40|$|The {{recent years}} have {{observed}} a tremendous shift from the technology-centric assessment to the user-centric assessment of network services. Consequently, measurement and modelling of Quality of Experience (QoE) attracted many contributions from researchers and practitioners. Generally, QoE is assessed via active and passive measurements. While the former usually allows QoE assessment on the test traffic, the latter opens avenues for continuous QoE assessment on the real traffic generated by the users. This thesis contributes towards passive assessment of QoE. This thesis document begins with a background on the fundamentals of network management and objective QoE assessment. It extends the discussion further to the QoE-centric monitoring and management of network, complimented by the details about QoE estimator agent developed within the Celtic project QuEEN (Quality of Experience Estimators in Network). The discussion on findings starts with results from subjective tests to {{understand the relationship between}} waiting times and user subjective feedback over time. These results strengthen the understanding of timescales on which users react, as well as, the effect of user memory on QoE. The findings show that QoE drops significantly when the user faces recurring waiting times of 0. 5  s to 4  s durations in case of video streaming and web <b>browsing</b> <b>services.</b> With recurring network disturbances within every 8  s – 16  s time intervals, the user tolerance to waiting times decreases constantly, showing the sign of user memory of recent disturbances. Subsequently, this document introduces and evaluates a passive wavelet-based QoE monitoring method. The method detects timescales on which transient outages occur frequently. A study presents results from qualitative measurements, showing the ability of wavelet to differentiate on-fly between “Good” and “Bad” traffic streams. In sequel, a quantitative study systematically evaluates wavelet-based metrics. Subsequently, the subjective evaluation and wavelet analysis of 5 – 6  minutes long video streaming sessions on mobile networks show that wavelet-based metrics is indeed useful for passive monitoring of QoE issues. Finally, this thesis investigates a method for passive monitoring of user reactions to degrading network performance. The method is based on the TCP termination flags. With a systematic evaluation in a test environment, the results characterise termination of data transfers in case of different user actions in the web browser...|$|E
40|$|Tailorability in {{ubiquitous}} computing systems is needed at different levels, {{depending on the}} targeted end users. For inexperienced end users lacking computer competency, high level mechanisms for tailoring are needed. Systems such as ASTRA, which use a service oriented architecture, can provide such high level tailorability through service composition. With service composition, services can be combined and configured to form applications. However, using service composition introduces new challenges for end users. To find appropriate services, users need mechanisms for searching and <b>browsing</b> <b>services.</b> Equally important is it that users are able to understand how services work and what functionality they offer. Service descriptions can ease this task, {{but the problem with}} existing approaches to service descriptions is that they are not intended for end users and are hard to understand. This work looks at social tagging, which is a collaborative process where users attach labels or tags to items. This leads to user created metadata, as opposed to metadata created by experts. By introducing social tagging in ASTRA to describe services, users are provided with a framework for sharing their understanding of services with fellow users. To create a solution for social tagging for service descriptions, a thorough problem analysis was performed. The analysis considered the design space of tagging systems to find appropriate design choices in the problem context. Providing several tag visibility levels was identified as important, especially community tagging. The quality of tags as seen from the community members' perspective is likely to increase, as members of communities often share similar opinions and understandings. An important difference identified between existing tagging systems and tagging of services is that services can be embedded in physical devices. Thus, services can be discovered and accessed physically, which means that physical access to the services' tags should be supported. A requirements specification for a tagging system was specified, focusing on the platform requirements for basic tagging mechanisms, tag based navigation, and searching. The requirements lead to a design of platform architecture, aiming at extending the UbiCollab platform with social tagging functionality. The architecture uses a client/server solution, where the server service is shared among a network of users and handles public and community level tags. The client service is a local service which handles private tags, and acts as an intermediary between end user tools and the server service. A prototype of the platform services and an end user tool was implemented. The implementation is demonstrated through scenarios, showing possible uses of the tagging system. </p...|$|E
