50|$|The {{shell plates}} of the boiler and firebox were of mild steel, the tubes were of brass and the firebox of copper. The grates {{were of the}} finger-bar rocking type. The bar frame was 4+1/2 in thick and was {{machined}} from solid mild steel slab. Steel castings were provided for the front buffer, knees at the motion plate, spring and compensating beam brackets, axlebox guides, wheel centres and eccentric sheaves. The cylinders were each cast in one piece {{with half of the}} <b>boiler</b> <b>saddle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Double Fairlie was {{the first}} {{articulated}} locomotive to enter service in South Africa and also the first to have Walschaerts valve gear, which had been invented in 1844 by Belgian locomotive foreman Egide Walschaerts. The locomotive which was acquired by the CGR was of the separate boiler type. It had two boiler barrels, with a central firebox common to both barrels and fired from the side. The buffing and drawgear were fitted on the two engine units. The pivots were located under the two <b>boiler</b> <b>saddles</b> and were carried on centre bearings which formed part of the engine unit frames.|$|R

50|$|The {{greatest}} operational difficulty was on downhill grades where ice {{allowed the}} sleds to accelerate {{faster than the}} engine. Jack-knifing sleds pushed many log haulers into trees, and most photos of log haulers show rebuilt cabs and bent ironwork on the <b>boiler</b> and <b>saddle</b> tank. Hay was spread over the downhill routes {{in an effort to}} increase friction under the sleds, but hungry deer sometimes consumed the hay before the train arrived.|$|R
50|$|The engines were rebuilt {{during their}} working lives with {{various forms of}} <b>boiler</b> and <b>saddle</b> tanks, and they were also rebuilt as pannier tanks between 1909 and 1932 as Belpaire fireboxes were fitted. Most of the class worked in the GWR's Southern Division, the {{majority}} of them in South Wales. Two examples were {{to be found in the}} GWR London Division at time of nationalisation. Numbers 907 and 1861 were allocated to 81E (Didcot) in August 1950. All achieved 1000000 mi, and 23 of the class passed into British Railways stock in 1948, the last of them being withdrawn in 1951.|$|R
50|$|The Kerr, Stuart {{designs are}} typified {{by having a}} single {{trailing}} truck (allowing a large firebox to be placed behind the driving wheels) and/or having a saddle tank. Several designs of side tank locomotive were produced that shared a chassis and <b>boiler</b> with a <b>saddle</b> tank design {{and it is not}} unknown for a standard chassis from one design to be used with a different design's standard boiler to produce a locomotive to suit a customers special requirements.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Pug' {{locomotives}} {{are small}} steam locomotives which were produced for light shunting and industrial work, often on dockyards and factory sites, such as steelworks, collieries, etc. The Pugs are {{named after a}} common term in Scotland for a small industrial shunting locomotive - typically an 0-4-0 tank. ‘Pug’ was a dialect word meaning ‘monkey’ inferring an ugly appearance. [...] Another suggestion is that the locomotive type is named after the small sturdy 'Pug' dog, an ancient and well known breed with a snub nose, wrinkled face, and squarish body. Many were saddle tanks, with the water tank {{sitting on top of}} the <b>boiler</b> like a <b>saddle.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{water tank}} sits {{on top of}} the <b>boiler</b> like a <b>saddle</b> sits atop a horse. [...] Usually the tank is curved in cross-section, {{although}} in some cases there were straight sides surmounted by a curve (like an inverted 'U'), or even an ogee shape (a concave arc flowing into a convex arc). Saddle tanks were a popular arrangement especially for smaller locomotives in industrial use. It gave a greater water supply, but limited the size of the boiler and restricted access to it for cleaning. However, the locomotive has a higher centre of gravity and hence must operate at lower speeds. The driver's vision may also be restricted, again restricting the safe speed.|$|R
5|$|The railway {{was also}} {{upgraded}} at this time. Thomas Ward Ltd supplied replacement track in 1955, {{and a new}} 0-4-0 diesel electric shunter was ordered from Ruston and Hornsby Ltd in 1959. It was delivered from Lincoln on a low-loader in 1960, and was so successful that a second engine of the same type was ordered the following year. The Hudswell Clarke steam engine was cut up on site in 1962, but the Corporation wrote to Peckett's {{to see if they}} would convert the Peckett engine to diesel hydraulic transmission. Peckett's declined, and so the engine was converted at the works, by cutting off the <b>boiler</b> and <b>saddle</b> tank, and fitting a Perkins diesel engine removed from a crane. It was completed on 12 May 1962, and worked well, although it spent most of its subsequent life working at Thrybergh tip. It returned to Blackburn Meadows in 1967, and was cut up later that year. A prototype steel side-tipping wagon was ordered from Robert Hudson Ltd of Leeds in 1955, and a further 22 followed in 1957, to replace the original wooden wagons. Charles Roberts and Co Ltd of Wakefield supplied 12 more in 1958, and a further 35 in 1961, with Hudsons supplying the final 6 in 1963.|$|R
