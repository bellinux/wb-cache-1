5000|$|Under Russert, {{the program}} was {{expanded}} to one hour and became less of a televised press conference, focusing more on Russert's questions and comments; Russert also engaged in longer in-depth interviews and hosted panels of experts to discuss the topics featured in that week's broadcast. Russert signed off each edition by saying, [...] "That's all for today. We'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> If it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the 14 years we've {{been doing}} South Park {{we have never}} done a show that we couldn't stand behind. We {{delivered}} our version of the show to Comedy Central and they made a determination to alter the episode. It wasn't some meta-joke on our part. Comedy Central added the bleeps. In fact, Kyle's customary final speech was about intimidation and fear. It didn't mention Muhammad at all but it got bleeped too. We'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> with a whole new show about something completely different and we'll see what happens to it.|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing {{the first}} episode for The Guardian {{newspaper}} the day after it had aired, Gareth McLean wrote that [...] "...it's bloody magic. The story is gripping, the acting is ace and Paul Abbott's script is outstanding. His ear for dialogue, and for different voices, is exceptional. The exposition is swift, nifty and joyously unclunky. The characters are credible and rounded. If you can count the best dramas of recent years on the fingers of both hands, it's time to grow a new finger." [...] Other newspaper critics were similarly impressed with the opening installment. In The Times, Paul Hoggart wrote that [...] "Two excellent performances Morrissey and Simm ensure that the relationship has a turbulent dynamism that is credible and engaging." [...] James Walton in The Daily Telegraph was more cautious, feeling that the opening episode had been promising but the serial as a whole still {{had the potential to}} go wrong. [...] "At this stage however, the programme is certainly good enough to make me hope not and to ensure that I'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> to find out." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her urgency made me laugh, {{even while}} I {{perceived}} the pathos of it. [...] "I can't {{bring her to}} you, mother, till she is willing to come as a bride--but she's thinking about it, and I <b>am</b> going <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> to get my answer. Be patient a little while longer. I promise you the whole question will be settled soon, and I {{hope it will be}} settled our way. Zulime seems to like me." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 2004-05 season (his {{first season}} with Rangers) he injured the {{cruciate}} ligament in his knee while playing. The injury was supposed to keep him off the field for months but Marvin Andrews was only off for one Scottish League Cup match and <b>was</b> <b>back</b> the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> as he believed God would keep him fit, a move which worried medical staff and supporters alike. Andrews' leg and form held up {{for the rest of}} the season, which saw his first SPL medal but the same injury eventually caught up with him, ruling him out of Trinidad And Tobago's World Cup 2006 campaign. When Andrews scored for Rangers, or won the Man of the Match at Ibrox Stadium, the song [...] "I'm a Believer" [...] by The Monkees was played.|$|R
5000|$|Celebrity Prognosticator - The segment {{was based}} in Le Batard's {{assertion}} that NFL [...] "experts" [...] who pick games do not actually have any knowledge that make their picks worth valuing and are guessing like everyone else. To prove this point, a random celebrity joined the show to pick NFL games against the spread. The celebrity's picks were in competition against Colin Cowherd and if the celebrity does {{a better job of}} picking than Cowherd he or she <b>is</b> invited <b>back</b> the <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> If the celebrity loses, the show finds a new prognosticator. As a friend of the show, Alan Thicke, appeared frequently in the segment and was reigning Celebrity Prognosticator {{at the time of his}} death in 2016. Other Celebrity Prognosticators have included, Carrot Top, Billy Bob Thornton, Alice Cooper, Big Boi and Ric Flair, among others. Mike & Mike imitated the segment, renaming it [...] "Celebrity Picker", beginning on September 11, 2015, with Ty Burrell.

40|$|Sara is {{exhausted}} as {{she waves}} {{goodbye to the}} early intervention team members and closes her front door. The individualized family service plan (IFSP) was a bit overwhelming, but she was sure that this was mainly because {{this was the first}} one. And {{it would have been better}} if Bob could have been there, but he is traveling with work today. Surely the review will be easier because she will at least have a feel for the forms and what to expect. Regardless, this whole process feels like a whirlwind, and Sara isn’t sure she can even remember the strategies suggested for each identified outcome. Everyone had some great ideas, but as Sara sits down at the kitc en table and looks at the IFSP, th great practical ideas that w discussed don’t appear to be on the paper. She is sure they z made some great suggestions Jj) ! for helping Jakob, but the 4 ’ phrases on the IFSP don’t really make sense, and she just can’t remember all the details. Sara tries to remember what the team members discussed. She knows they will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> to talk about all of this, help her learn, and try out the strategies, but she thinks it sure would be nice if it were all clearer on the &dquo;big plan&dquo; so she and Bob can see how it all fits together for z them...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "This just {{might have been}} the best Once Upon a Time so far this season, despite “Labor of Love” largely {{focusing}} on two people we’ve only just met. This episode had the perfect balance of well-paced drama, strong character arcs, and a solid twist or two to compel us to come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> This essentially recaptured that adventurous, yet emotionally grounded feeling of the first two seasons. To say I loved this {{would be one of the}} big understatements of the TV season so far." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{my opinion}} this {{argument}} is about as logical as saying that if one had been told, on entering a casino, that the odds on No 7 coming up at roulette were only 1 in 37, one would have gone away and come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> or gone to a different casino. The question is whether one would have taken the opportunity to avoid or reduce the risk, not whether one would have changed the scenario in some irrelevant detail. The judge found as {{a fact that the}} risk would have been precisely the same whether it was done then or later or by that competent surgeon or by another." ...|$|R

John, who has dropped out of his Yale music faculty position and is now living in a depressed and dirty stupor, agrees to Rhoda's offer.

He also fulfilled contractual obligations by incorporating live commercials into the broadcast. He also noted that nobody commented on how the show itself was after it finished airing, instead mentioning how good the commercials were and that the show went off the air at the right time. He ended his commentary with, [...] "I'm coming <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week!</b> I don't know what we're gonna do ... so, {{take my word for it}} ... tune in on the next chapter, because this might be the greatest 'soapless' opera you've ever seen!".|$|R

Jones, after being released from the infield care center, said he and Kahne, were [...] "three-wide right on the start and then the 5 ran us up into the fence.

5000|$|When the {{programme}} {{was renamed}} Saturday Showdown, the show {{no longer had}} the Doc or his lab.

[...] and we see through the door's frosted glass, the blur of The Doctor and he shouts through the letterbox. But viewers without cable or satellite never got to see him that week, as he only fully appeared on the CITV Channel's Holly and Stephen's Saturday Showdown Extra. Though Stephen asked the Doc on the show if he could come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> it <b>was</b> to be a one off appearance, and The Foundation confirmed that the Doc was only a guest for this show. However, the Doc re-appeared for the final show on 1 July 2006.|$|R

500|$|Tom Chambers was {{approached}} about assuming {{the role of}} Sam by BBC casting director Julie Harkin, who was also responsible for casting fellow Holby City newcomers Rakie Ayola as Kyla Tyson and Luke Roberts as Joseph Byrne. Chambers has revealed that he sent a video of himself performing a Fred Astaire tap dance routine to over 800 stage and television directors and producers in the [...] UK, explaining: [...] "Julie Harkin in casting at Holby saw it {{and gave me a}} call because they thought it was unusual.
