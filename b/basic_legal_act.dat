Public assistance has to be made also onto thing of definite entrepreneurs. In Poland in years 1997 - 2002 the largest part of public assistance was directed to large state owned enterprises first of all in coal mining, agriculture as well as railway transportation sector and postal services. In year 2002 we could observe significant changes in the structure of this support. There was a great increase of support for the enterprises from private sector especially small and medium size. This change was due to the low of restructuring of public receivables. Enterprises use help in form of transfer of properties’ value and in form of decrease of tax burdens. Public assistance is a very important instrument for supporting competitiveness and elasticity. Its efficiency depends on the forms of support of entrepreneurs, cohesions of used instruments as well as on possibility of theirs implementation through subjects.

V letu 2006 je Sodišče EU prvič definiralo pojem »invalidnost«. Pred tem je obstajalo mnogo razlag tega pojma, ki pa so se bolj osredotočale na medicinski vidik pojmovanja invalidnosti kot na družbeni vidik. Sodišče EU je navedlo, da je iz zahteve po enotni uporabi prava EU in načela enotnosti ponudilo avtonomno razlago pojma. Diplomska naloga obravnava pravice invalidov, osredotočena je na primere iz sodne prakse Sodišča EU. V uvodu so razloženi osnovni pojmi za lažje razumevanje nadaljnjega obravnavanja problematike in osnovni pravni akti, sprejeti na mednarodni ravni in ravni Evropske unije.

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{interest}} in this article is the importance of knowing and connecting medical ethics and medical law for the category of health workers. The author believes that knowledge of bioethics which as a discipline deals with the study of ethical issues and health care law as a legal discipline, as well as medical activity in general, result in the awareness of health professionals of human rights, and since the performance of activities of health workers is almost always linked to the question of life and death, then the lack of knowledge of <b>basic</b> <b>legal</b> <b>acts</b> would not be justified at all. The aim of the paper was to present the importance of medical ethics and medical law among the medical staff. A retrospective analysis of the medical literature available on the indexed base KOBSON for the period 2005 - 2010 was applied. Analysis of all work leads {{to the conclusion that the}} balance between ethical principles and knowledge of medical law, trust and cooperation between the two sides that appear over health care can be considered a goal that every health care worker should strive for. This study supports the attitude that lack of knowledge and non-compliance with the ethical principles and medical law when put together can only harm the health care worker. In a way, this is the message to health care professionals that there is a need for the adoption of ethical principles and knowledge of medical law, because the most important position of all health workers is their dedication to the patient as a primary objective and the starting point of ethics...|$|R

Republic of Macedonia as a modern state, although relatively young, in its existence as an independent state is oriented and aims towards joining the European family of democratic states in the legal frame of the European Union. For this reason, the Republic of Macedonia is in the process of adjusting its domestic law under European law and in this sense the legal norms {{of human rights}} and freedoms are implemented in domestic law as a condition sine gua non (essential requirement without it cannot be possible) to achieve that historic goal.
