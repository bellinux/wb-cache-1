Berian argued that Nike failed to match the New Balance offer; both Nike and New Balance offered him $125,000 per year for three years, but the Nike offer included large reductions if Berian failed to meet expectations, while the New Balance offer contained no such reductions. Nike claimed they were prepared to fully match the New Balance contract but Berian's agent, Merhawi Keflezighi, did not communicate its terms to them adequately. In early June 2016, Portland district judge Marco Hernandez approved Nike's request to temporarily prohibit Berian from competing in New <b>Balance</b> <b>gear.</b> Nike's claims that reductions were an industry standard were contradicted by several of its rivals, including Oiselle, Brooks and New Balance. Hernandez was expected to make his next ruling on the matter after a hearing on June 21, but decided to delay it for a week; he did not extend the injunction against Berian competing in New <b>Balance</b> <b>gear,</b> which expired, and his comments in court indicated he felt that Nike had failed to match the New Balance offer.

50|$|For {{uncontrolled}} sailing craft {{some form}} of steering control is required, since with a fixed rudder position the model will turn into the wind.Three kinds of steering-gear are used, the weighted swinging rudder, the main-sheet <b>balance</b> <b>gear,</b> and the steering vane, the object of each being to keep the model on a true course, either before or against the wind.

The muzzle brake produces about twice the overpressure {{in the area around}} the gun that is acceptable to Western armies, and is the reason it is often seen being fired with a long lanyard, which reduces rate of fire. Furthermore, the maximum elevation angle is restricted to 18Â° (early versions) or 22Â° (later versions) when the breech is over a trail leg. This is enforced by a mechanical cam that prevents the piece firing for about 60% of the total top traverse, and limits range to about 12 km, with full maximum range only possible in the central arc of about 48Â° between each pair of legs. The extreme rearward location of the trunnions means the elevating mass is unbalanced, requiring a strong balancing mechanism to enable manual elevation.

5000|$|Due to his {{relationship}} with the scientist Robert Hooke he made some of the first watches with balance springs, these had the potential to be much more accurate than earlier watches. Several different kinds were experimented with, including an early type with double <b>balances</b> <b>geared</b> together in order to eliminate errors of motion. One of these was made for King Charles II and was signed [...] "Robert Hooke invent. 1658. T. Tompion fecit, 1675". William Derham mentions this in his book The Artificial Clockmaker. This watch, it seems, has not survived. The final form of balance spring arrangement used by Tompion was a plain spiral with a single balance, indeed the same arrangement employed by Christiaan Huygens in watches made for him by Thuret. A few of Tompion's early spiral balance spring movements were also of a similar specification to the Huygens/Thuret pattern as they had a standing barrel and no fusee. Huygens imagined that the latter would not be necessary as the spiral spring would render the balance isochronous. Tompion must have soon found this rather optimistic surmise was however incorrect, as all Tompion's subsequent spiral balance spring movements have fusees, and this design became the standard pattern in English watches throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|R

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to design and {{fabricate}} a micro spindle turning (micro lathe) attachment with a micro EDG. The main hollow spindle of the former is positioned horizontally (can also be vertically, if required), located over two tungsten carbide V-bearings and steel ball as end-thrust bearing on a carbide support. This can be rotated about the horizontal axis by a balanced miniature DC motor via a belt-pulley system, reducing the spindle speed to about 3000 rpm (can also be either decreased or increased continuously). This spindle system may also be used as an attachment to any NC table of any type of EDM through its motor housing structure, to receive motions in the horizontal plane. The spindle accomodates micro collets on the free end for holding jobs from 0. 5 to 2 mm diameter. To ensure a compact mono block design with minimal components and low stray capacitance in the system, the entire housing and support structure is of single piece made of ABS plastic. The design and fabrication of a compact wire feeding mechanism for micro EDG ensures in situ processing of the micro tool on the spindle. Travelling wire is used as the tool electrode and moves around a carbide wire guide. The wire tension and speed are controlled using a spring loaded friction pad and directly driven wind-up system.

40|$|A novel {{numerical}} procedure {{to design the}} optimal axial <b>balance</b> in external <b>gear</b> machines (EGMs) has been formulated and developed in the present study. Lateral lubricating interfaces exist between the lateral bushes and the rotating gears in pressure compensated designs of EGMs and {{play a significant role}} in minimizing power losses arising from fluid shear stress and leakages from the gap. Moreover, lateral bushes in pressure compensated designs of EGMs perform significant functions of sealing the tooth space volumes while they transfer fluid from the inlet to the outlet port. ^ The losses from the lateral gap from these two opposing sources can be minimized by designing an optimal balance area on the side of the lateral bushes which do not face the gears, while simultaneously ensuring that proper pressure is established at the high pressure port of the EGM. This condition is termed as the 2 Ì 7 axial balance 2 Ì 7 of the machine, which is significant in improving its reliability and reducing wear in the EGM under consideration. ^ To determine the optimal axial balance which minimizes the power losses associated with the lubricating gap in all operating conditions, all the static and hydrodynamic forces acting on the lateral bushes have to be considered. This delicate aspect of external gear units design is usually addressed through empirical procedures which rely heavily on experience, expertise and expensive experimental trial and error. ^ In this research, the proposed method is fully automatic and leverages the previous work of modeling the lateral lubricating interface between gears and lateral bushes in the author 2 Ì 7 s research group at Purdue. The developed procedure has a significant potential to virtually design the axial balance in a variety of EGM designs, results for which are presented in the current study. Furthermore, the possibilities of using the developed procedure to design new efficient solutions is demonstrated in this research by applying this method to design a micro surface shaping effect, by introducing a linear sloping wedge on either side of the gear teeth. Optimal axial balance configurations are determined for these effects which further improves the efficiency of the reference EGM chosen for the purpose of this study. ...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{gear box}} {{lubricants}} typically are hydrocarbon based mineral oils with considerable amounts of additives {{to overcome the}} lack of base fluid properties like wear protection, oxidation stability, load carrying capacity, low temperature solidification and drop of viscosity at higher temperatures. For today's wind turbine gearboxes, the requirements are more severe and synthetic hydrocarbon oils are used to improve on this, but all such hydrocarbon based lubricants require significant amounts of Extreme Pressure (EP) additives to meet performance requirements. Perfluoropolyether (PFPE) fluids provide load carrying capacity as an inherent property. During {{the course of the}} project with the main tasks of 'Establish a Benchmark', 'Lubricant Evaluation', 'Full Scale Gearbox Trial' and 'Economic Evaluation', the PAO Reference oil exhibited significant changes after laboratory gear testing, in service operation in the field and full scale gearbox trial. Four hydrocarbon base oils were selected for comparison in the benchmarking exercise and showed variation with respect to meeting the requirements for the laboratory micro-pitting tests, while the PFPE fluid exceeded the requirements even with the material taken after the full scale gear box trial. This is remarkable for a lubricant without EP additives. Laboratory bearing tests performed on the PFPE fluids before and after the full scale gear box trial showed the results met requirements for the industry standard. The PFPE fluid successfully completed the full scale gear box test program which included baseline and progressive staged load testing. The evaluation of gears showed no micro-pitting or objectionable wear. By the final stage, lubricant film thickness had been reduced to just 21 % of its original value, this was by design and resulted in a lambda ratio of well below 1. This test design scenario of a low lambda ratio is a very undesirable lubrication condition for real world but creates the ability to test the lubricating fluids performance under the most extreme conditions. The PAO Reference oil also passed its testing without any noticeable deterioration of the gear surface. However the PAO Reference oil was replaced midway through the progressive loading, as the lubricant was burned in an attempt to raise the sump temperature to the same levels as for the PFPE. Both materials experienced a decrease of viscosity during their respective run times. The viscosity index decreased for the PAO there while there was a slight increase for the PFPE. FZG laboratory gear tests and measurements of the drive motor's current during the full scale gear box trial were made to characterize the relative efficiency between the PFPE fluid and the PAO Reference oil. In the FZG laboratory efficiency test, the PFPE fluids show much higher churning losses due to their higher viscosity and density. The analysis seems to show that the efficiency correlates better to dynamic viscosity than any other of the measured metrics such as film thickness. In load stages where the load, speed and temperature are similar, the PFPE fluid has a greater film thickness and theoretical gear protection, but requires a larger current for the drive motor than the PAO. However in load stages where the film thickness is the same, the PFPE fluid's reduced dynamic viscosity gives it a slight efficiency advantage relative to the PAO reference oil. Ultimately, many factors such as temperature, rotational speed, and fluid viscosity combine in a complex fashion to influence the results. However, the PFPE's much lower change of viscosity with respect to temperature, allows variations in designing an optimum viscosity to <b>balance</b> efficiency versus <b>gear</b> protection. Economic analysis was done using Cost of Energy calculations. The results vary from 5. 3 % for a 'Likely Case' to 16. 8 % for a 'Best Case' scenario as potential cost improvement by using PFPE as the gearbox lubricating fluid. It is important to note the largest portion of savings comes in Levelized Replacement Cost, which is dictated by the assumption on gearbox reliability. Thus, verifying and quantifying the potential of PFPE fluid to effect gearbox reliability is the key assumption that would need to be further validated. In summary the proof of concept to use PFPE fluid as wind turbine gear box lubricant was validated with this project. The increase in life time was qualitatively demonstrated and this supports the need for future activity of field trials and laboratory aging studies to quantify the predicted 20 year life. With micro-pitting being the major failure mechanism in the last years, recent publications show that white etch cracking of bearings seem to have the highest impact on wind turbine reliability. With its higher film thicknesses compared to PAO reference oils, PFPE fluids have the potential to reduce this failure occurrence as well...|$|R
40|$| have {{a raised}} {{awareness}} of the various interests involved and issues at stake. What is fair and equitable benefit-sharing? Chapter 4 builds upon these different approaches insofar as it aims to investigate what exactly is understood by âfairâ and âequitableâ benefit-sharing, and how a fair and equitable benefit-sharing mechanism might best be realized. The different approaches to benefit-sharing outlined {{form the basis of}} a philosophical reflection and are discussed in parallel with the main principles of justice involved. These include the principle of commutative justice and, under the domain of distributive justice, the principles of entitlement, desert, need and equity. In addition to these criteria that may guide the allocation of benefits, the principles of procedural and cognitive justice also are discussed, as essential to the promotion of fair and equitable benefit-sharing. An important conclusion resulting from this reflection is that the bilateral exchange model of ABS in the CBD is in need of fundamental change. At present, it is practically impossible for countries and communities to secure a fair exchange for the plant genetic resources found within their territories, or for the traditional knowledge present in their culture. As an alternative, a model is proposed in which benefit-sharing obligations are not based on the specific exchange of these resources, but on their utilization. An advantage of such model is that it emphasizes the responsibilities for benefit-sharing at the user side. This is further supported by the principle of equity, elemental to benefit-sharing, which holds that the strongest parties have the biggest responsibilities to make a fair and equitable benefit-sharing mechanism work. Between sharing and protecting: Public research on genetic resources in the year of the potato Chapter 5 analyses the policies and environment of two public research institutes working with potato genetic resources, the International Potato Centre (CIP) in Peru and Wageningen University and Research Centre (Wageningen UR) in the Netherlands. The two institutes are situated in totally different environments, but both are increasingly confronted with an array of (inter) national regulations, interests and perspectives that surround the genetic material, (traditional) knowledge and technologies with which they work. While CIP, as member of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), aims to promote the sharing of potato genetic resources throughout the world for the sake of food security, it is situated in a country that is deeply ambivalent about the sharing goal and where concerns about biopiracy proliferate. Wageningen UR, on the other hand, is concerned with supporting the Dutch potato sector but it has to make sure that its IP and valorization strategies do not impede its research for development goals. Both institutes are continuously weighing up their own interests and those of the various stakeholders they work with in order to strike a <b>balance</b> between policies <b>geared</b> towards sharing and those aimed at protection. However, in the present context where poor but gene-rich countries and communities, as well as industrialized countries and biotechnology companies are all mainly concerned with protecting their resources in order to reap the benefits and preclude misappropriation, it is incumbent on public research institutes to dare to share. For that purpose, they have to develop new ways of sharing and protecting in order to adhere to their mission and best serve the public interest. Reconsidering intellectual property policies in public research: A symposium Chapter 6 contains the start document and report of the international conference on âReconsidering Intellectual Property Policies in Public Research: Sharing the benefits of biotechnology with developing countriesâ organized at Wageningen UR in April 2008. The start document describes the increasing role of IPRs in biotechnology research and the difficult process that public research institutes face in seeking to obtain access to IP protected materials while working on biotechnologies destined for the poor. The problems involved range from analyzing complex IPR landscapes to negotiating free or affordable access licenses with parties that have little to gain from such deals. At the same time, however, public researchers are also increasingly stimulated to protect their own knowledge and inventions â so an important question for public research institutes is how they can (and should) go about preventing their IP policy from hampering innovation in poor countries. These issues were discussed at the international conference, which brought stakeholders together from fields as diverse as plant sciences, social and development studies, intellectual property offices, research funding organizations, the private seed industry, and civil society. The report describes the various discussions, presentations and main findings of the conference, which also focused on possible strategies to help public research institutes to secure their freedom to operate in the field of research for development, such as patent pools, humanitarian licenses and open-source biotechnology. Valorizing science: Whose values? Chapter 7 is a viewpoint article that reflects further upon the current trend towards valorization, i. e. the creation of economic value, in public research. It asks, more specifically, whether the focus on economic indicators is the optimal policy for science to contribute to society, or for the advancement of science itself. Hereby, it looks back on the Wageningen conference and its central subject matter, but now with special attention given to the organization process and the difficulties of bringing different stakeholders together to discuss complex problems and their possible solutions. The issue of valorization in public research involves a wide variety of easily conflicting views and interests, which requires continued input and dialogue between the different stakeholders in order to come to workable solutions. It is shown that this is not always easy to accomplish, for example because stakeholders may already disagree about the problem definition itself: a problem for one group may be a triviality or even benefit for another, and this even within the same institute. But as the current valorization trend influences and impresses upon the role of public research itself, the research institutes as well as individual researchers will have to invest the necessary time and effort to reflect on their impact and (long term) implications. Towards Justice in Benefit-Sharing Chapter 8 is the concluding chapter that brings the major findings of this research project together. Without repeating all the conclusions of the separate chapters, it aims to give an overview by reflecting on the research questions set out at the beginning in Chapter 1 and the general conclusions that have come out of this. Given the many practical (and ethical) complexities involved, and the easily diverging interests and perspectives {{when it comes to the}} sharing and/or protection of plant genetic resources, (traditional) knowledge and intellectual property rights, we can predict that benefit-sharing will continue to arouse much discussion and debate in the years to come. In this thesis, some fundamental changes to the current exchange model in the CBD are proposed in order to move away from the current deadlock in the international ABS negotiations, and to work towards a fair and equitable outcome. It must be clear that benefit-sharing entails burden-sharing, and that a successful implementation of fair and equitable benefit-sharing requires the continued commitment of all stakeholders involved on the international, national and local levels. But with such commitment, benefit-sharing can set a new standard of justice in how countries, companies, public research institutes and indigenous communities interact with each other...|$|R
