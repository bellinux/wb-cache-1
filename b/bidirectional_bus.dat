40|$|We {{present a}} {{configuration}} technique for a Large Area Integrated Circuit (LAIC) which is manufactured by wafer stepping. A LAIC {{consists of four}} identical subsystems, i. e., a subsystem is the only building block of a LAIC and contains base cells or processing nodes as well as interconnects and pad cells. To ensure a proper cooperation of all subsystems and to enable communication between the subsystems, an on-chip self-configuration scheme is realized. Therefore, not only the subsystems are configured, but also the global bus system, connecting all subsystems. Two methods for configuration are applied: static and dynamic. The processing nodes, the pad cells, and the input bus systems are configured statically.

Instead of leveraging the costly and inaccurate human surveys about people's mobility, {{we intend to}} explore the night bus route planning issue by using taxi GPS traces. Specifically, we propose a two-phase approach for bidirectional night bus route planning.

In the second phase, given the bus route origin, destination, candidate bus stops, and bus operation time constraints, we derive several effective rules to build the bus route graph and prune invalid stops and edges iteratively. Based on this graph, we further develop a bidirectional probability-based spreading algorithm to generate candidate bus routes automatically.
