40|$|Introduction Intraductal {{papilloma}} of {{the breast}} {{is characterized by a}} proliferation of epithelial and myoepithelial cells overlying fibrovascular stalks creating an arborescent structure within the lumen of duct. Case report We present a 36 years female patient with history of <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> the <b>nipple</b> of right breast since last 3 months. Examination of right nipple revealed bleeding and mammography show a right ductal papilloma. We performed microdochectomy of the involved duct with excision of ductal papilloma of the right breast. Histopathology of the excised specimen revealed ductal papillomawith adenosis and ductal hyperplasia. Conclusion If papilloma is located to a single duct,microdochectomy gives satisfactory results in younger patients with a minimal interference withthe breast...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Factor V {{deficiency}} {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} coagulation disorder. Awareness of presenting features and management is important to avoid bleeding complications associated with mortality and neurodisability. Case presentation A 6 -day-old Pakistani boy was admitted with <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> the left <b>nipple.</b> His parents were first cousins. A coagulation screen showed a prothrombin time of 41 s (control 14 s), a partial thromboplastin time of 132 s (control 33 s) and a normal thrombin time of 15 s (control 14 s). Factor V activity was Conclusion This case illustrates that in an unusually bleeding newborn of consanguineous parents rare severe homozygous bleeding disorders need to be considered. Nipple bleeding {{may be the first}} presentation of a congenital bleeding disorder. In cases of factor V deficiency where factor concentrates are not available long term use of fresh frozen plasma can prevent potentially life threatening bleeding. </p...|$|R
40|$|Paget′s {{disease is}} a rare form of breast cancer often {{associated}} with an underlying ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive cancer. A 47 -year-old female patient presented with <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> the left <b>nipple</b> since 4 months. Imprint smears from the lesion showed pleomorphic malignant epithelial cells in singles and in small clusters, many of them containing dark brown cytoplasmic pigment granules. There was no palpable breast lump or axillary lymph node enlargement. Based on the physical examination and cytological features, a diagnosis of malignant melanoma with a differential of Paget′s disease of the nipple was made. Biopsy showed features of Paget′s disease and immunohistochemistry was positive for HER- 2 /neu, negative for HMB- 45 and S- 100, thus confirming the diagnosis. This case {{has been reported to}} emphasize the fact that Paget′s cells can contain imbibed brown cytoplasmic pigment and should not be mistaken for melanoma cells on cytology smears...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bleeding</b> <b>from</b> gastric varices {{has been}} {{successfully}} treated by endoscopic modalities. Once the <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> the gastric varices is stabilized, endoscopic treatment and/or interventional radiology should be performed to eradicate varices completely. Partial splenic artery embolization is a supplemental treatment to prolong the obliteration of the veins feeding and/or draining the varices. The overall incidence of <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> gastric varices is lower than that from esophageal varices. No studies to date have defi nitively characterized the causal factors behind <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> gastric varices. The initial episodes of <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> esophageal varices or gastric varices without prior treatment may be at least partly triggered by {{a violation of the}} mucosal barrier overlying varices. This is especially likely in the case of varices of the fundus. In view of the high rate of hemostasis achieved among bleeding gastric varices, treatment should be administered in selective cases. Among untreated cases, steps to prevent gastric mucosal injury confer very important protection against gastric variceal bleeding...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aim. <b>Bleeding</b> <b>from</b> esophageal varices is a {{significant}} factor in mortality of patients with terminal liver cirrhosis. This complication is a major health problem for recipients on the list for liver transplant. In that regard, studying predictors of variceal bleeding episode is very important. Also, it is important to find the best survival predictor among prognostic scores. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare validity of prognostic scores in assessment of survival in hospital-treated patients after <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> esophageal varices, and to compare validity of baseline Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and Modul for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores with CTP creatinine modified (CTP-crea) I and II scores in assessment of survival in patients within a long-term follow-up period after the episode of <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> esophageal varices. Methods. The study included a total of 126 patients suffering from terminal liver cirrhosis submited to testing CTP score score I and II, MELD score, MELD Na score, integrated MELD score, MELD sodium (MESO) index, United Kingdom Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (UKELD) score and updated MELD score. Results. Patients with <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> esophageal varices most often had CTP score rank C (46, 9 %). CTP score rank B had 37. 5 % patients, while the smallest percentage of patients had CTP rank A, 15. 6 % of them. Patients who have values of CTP score higher than 10. 50 and <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> esophagus, have 3. 2 times higher chance for death outcome compared to other patients. Patients who have values of CTP-crea I score higher than 10. 50 and <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> esophagus, have 3. 1 times higher chance for death out-come than other patients. Patients who have values of CTP-crea II score higher than 11. 50 and <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> esophagus, have 3, 7 times higher chance for death outcome compared to other patients. Conclusion. Survival of patients with <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> esophageal varices in the short-term follow up can be predicted by following CTP score and creatinine modified CTP scores. Patients with <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> esophageal varices who have CTP score and CTP-crea I score higher than 10. 5 and CTP-crea II score higher than 11. 5, have statistically significantly higher risk from mortality within one-month follow-up compared to patients with <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> esophageal varices who have lower numerical values of scores of the CTP group...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Acute <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> {{the upper}} {{gastrointestinal}} {{system is a}} medical emergency which is followed by high mortality rate, ranging from 6 to 15 % in spite of modern diagnostic methods and treatment. <b>Bleeding</b> <b>from</b> the upper gastrointestinal system {{may be caused by}} gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the stomach, which are mainly characterized by occult bleeding, while profuse bleeding rarely occurs accompanied by hemorrhagic shock. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors of stomach are the most common mesenchimal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. Case Report. In our study we showed a 60 -year-old female patient with profuse <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> the stomach and the clinical picture of severe hemorrhagic shock, caused by gastrointestinal stromal tumor. An ovoid junction, raised towards the lumen, covered with ulcerated mucosa in several places and followed by massive arterial bleeding was found intraoperatively, after the performed gastrotomy. Histopathological examination with immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that this was a gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the stomach. Discussion. Acute <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> the digestive system is a sudden and serious condition of the body. Urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy is a sensitive and specific diagnostic and therapeutic method of choice. Massive <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> the upper gastrointestinal tract is very rarely caused by gastrointestinal stromal tumors, whose clinical picture is very heterogeneous and depends on tumor size and location. Abundant <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> the tumor is an indication for urgent surgical intervention. Conclusion. According to the literature massive hemorrhage of the upper digestive system can rarely be caused by gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the stomach. It is shown that abundant hemorrhage of the upper digestive tract can be caused with gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Surgical resection is the main form of treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the digestive system and <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> these tumors caused by failure of endoscopic hemostasis...|$|R
