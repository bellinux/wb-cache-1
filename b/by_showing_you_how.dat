60|$|I see you are {{astonished}} {{at the notion}} that water can make Alps. But it was just because I knew you would be {{astonished at}} Madam How's doing so great a thing with so simple a tool, that I began <b>by</b> <b>showing</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> she was doing the same thing in a small way here upon these flats. For the safest way to learn Madam How's methods is to watch her at work in little corners at commonplace business, which will not astonish or frighten us, nor put huge hasty guesses and dreams into our heads. Sir Isaac Newton, some will tell you, found out the great law of gravitation, which holds true of all the suns and stars in heaven, by watching an apple fall: and even if he did not find it out so, he found it out, we know, by careful thinking over the plain and commonplace fact, that things have weight. So do you be humble and patient, and watch Madam How at work on little things. For that is the way to see her at work upon all space and time.|$|E

40|$|This noted design expert from Germany {{continues}} his series <b>by</b> <b>showing</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> can best {{take advantage of}} JFET performance. In Part 1 of this article, I discussed the single-stage (or single-ended) amplifier operating in common-source mode. As these stages are usually limited in audio to AC signals, the inherent DC drift is of relatively little importance. You can even use them for DC signals if you select the working point carefully at zero temperature coefficient. However, if you remember the formula for zero tempco (VGS = VP + 0. 63 V), you realize that the condition is different from unit to unit, since VP is different. A better solution {{is to use a}} differential amplifier, where the drifts of two matched JFETs tend to cancel each other. The configuration is shown in Fig. 12 a. If R 0 is large enough, then...|$|R

40|$|This {{course will}} {{introduce}} you to the American political system and the core theories that seek to explain U. S. politics. We will cover basic information, like what Congress does and how the Electoral College operates, as well as deeper questions like: Why do elected officials behave as they do? What role do parties and interest groups play in representing the diverse views and interests of the American people? Why does America rarely have a credible third party alternative? Why do citizens participate in politics? I have three main goals for the semester. First, on a substantive level, I {{hope that you will}} establish a solid foundation for understanding U. S. politics. To accomplish this goal the course will {{introduce you to}} a variety of academic theories that scholars have developed to explain how the American political system operates. Second, from a procedural standpoint, I hope you will hone your critical thinking and reading skills. In other words, I want you to further your ability to carefully interrogate ideas, arguments, and evidence. Finally, I hope that this course encourages you to ask questions about the political world. As developing scholars (and soon-to-be thesis writers) it is essential that you learn how to ask and answer questions that are important to you. This course begins that process <b>by</b> <b>showing</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> previous scholars have asked and answered their questions about how American politics works...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have already}} said that Mr. Shuttleworthy {{was one of the}} most respectable and, undoubtedly, he was the most wealthy man in Rattleborough, while [...] "Old Charley Goodfellow" [...] was upon as {{intimate}} terms with him as if he had been his own brother. The two old gentlemen were next-door neighbours, and, although Mr. Shuttleworthy seldom, if ever, visited [...] "Old Charley," [...] and never was known to take a meal in his house, still this did not prevent the two friends from being exceedingly intimate, as I have just observed; for [...] "Old Charley" [...] never let a day pass without stepping in three or four times to see how his neighbour came on, and very often he would stay to breakfast or tea, and almost always to dinner, and then the amount of wine that was made way with by the two cronies at a sitting, it would really be a difficult thing to ascertain. [...] "Old Charleys" [...] favorite beverage was Chateau-Margaux, and it appeared to do Mr. Shuttleworthy's heart good to see the old fellow swallow it, as he did, quart after quart; so that, one day, when the wine was in and the wit as a natural consequence, somewhat out, he said to his crony, as he slapped him upon the back--"I tell you what it is, 'Old Charley,' you are, by all odds, the heartiest old fellow I ever came across in all my born days; and, since you love to guzzle the wine at that fashion, I'll be darned if I don't have to make thee a present of a big box of the Chateau-Margaux. Od rot me,"--(Mr. Shuttleworthy had a sad habit of swearing, although he seldom went beyond [...] "Od rot me," [...] or [...] "By gosh," [...] or [...] "By the jolly golly,")--"Od rot me," [...] says he, [...] "if I don't send an order to town this very afternoon for a double box of the best that can be got, and I'll make ye a present of it, I will!--ye needn't say a word now--I will, I tell ye, and there's an end of it; so look out for it--it will come to hand some of these fine days, precisely when ye are looking for it the least!" [...] I mention this little bit of liberality on the part of Mr. Shuttleworthy, just <b>by</b> way of <b>showing</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> very intimate an understanding existed between the two friends.|$|R

40|$|Although {{playing with}} scull and similar toys {{is a good}} {{introduction}} to the software inter face of a Linux device driver, implementing a real device requir es hardwar e. The driver is the abstraction layer between software concepts and hardware circuitry; as such, it needs to talk with both of them. Up to now, we have examined the internals of software concepts; this chapter completes the picture <b>by</b> <b>showing</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> a driver can access I/O ports and I/O memory while being portable acr oss Linux platforms. This chapter continues {{in the tradition of}} staying as independent of specific hardwar e as possible. However, wher e specific examples are needed, we use simple digital I/O ports (like the standard PC parallel port) to show how the I/O instructions work, and normal frame-buffer video memory to show memory-mapped I/O. We chose simple digital I/O because it is the easiest form of input/output port. Also, the Centronics parallel port implements raw I/O and is available in most computers: data bits written to the device appear on the output pins, and voltage levels on the input pins are dir ectly accessible by the processor. In practice, you have to connect LEDs to the port to actually see the results of a digital I/O operation, but the underlying hardware is extr emely easy to use. I/O Por ts and I/O Memory Every peripheral device is controlled by writing and reading its registers. Most of the time a device has several registers, and they are accessed at consecutive addr esses, either in the memory address space or in the I/O address space. At the hardware level, there is no conceptual differ ence between memory regions and I/O regions: both of them are accessed by asserting electrical signals on th...|$|E
