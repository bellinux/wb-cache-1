40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{design a}} well {{ventilated}} environment for densely populated areas {{has always been}} a challenge for urban planners. The wind availability at pedestrian level is especially crucial in hot and humid climate. Given the same wind availability, the urban microclimates within the same region of the city could be very different due to various urban morphologies. Planners could control a number of design parameters like building bulk, <b>building</b> <b>alignment</b> and site coverage to prevent wind blockage and increase the wind availability. This paper aims to provide urban design guidelines for future development in order to increase the pedestrian level wind availability in congested hot and humid urban situations based on real examples in Hong Kong. Our study focused on how different urban morphologies would affect the pedestrian level air ventilation in the city and resulted in different microclimates. To achieve this, results of a LES feasibility study of two selected urban areas in Hong Kong, which is conducted by Leibniz University of Hannover, would be analyzed and some urban design guidelines would be recommended...|$|E

A three-dimensional, phased, fully coupled finite element model with non-linear material properties is used as a tool to perform a parametric study. The model includes the simulation of the tunnel construction process, with the tunnel located adjacent to a masonry building. Three different type of settlements are included (sagging, hogging and a combination of them), with seven different increasing angles of the building with respect to the tunnel axis. The alignment parameter is assessed, based on the maximum occurring crack width, measured in the building.

40|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War, the {{municipalities}} to {{the west}} and north of the city of Brussels, were only very partially impacted by the urbanisation associated with the growth of the capital. Nevertheless, these same municipalities were extensively covered by <b>building</b> <b>alignment</b> plans, which the municipalities themselves had prepared. Everything was therefore in place for development of the Brussels urban area to occur organically via spacious residential neighbourhoods. However, {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the war, conditions radically changed. Firstly, the legal framework for controlling the urbanisation process was completely reformed, with the focus no longer on alignments but instead on functional planning via zoning and determining exact size for constructions. This framework encouraged the municipalities to revise the form to be given to their future development and contributed to the widespread use of the green city model, with buildings freely located within park settings. Secondly, the involvement of private actors in urbanisation evolved from land development towards property development, which fundamentally altered the type of construction and its relationship with planning. These two changes resulted in an entirely different face to the urbanisation of the western outer ring, that of the green ring, of which Anderlecht is a model example. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|In {{the course}} of my {{research}} on the orientation of Romanesque churches in Tuscany, I came across a very interesting case. The entrance and the axis of two churches in Barga (St. Cristoforo's dome and St. Frediano's church in Sommocolonia - one of Barga’s boroughs) look at the same point on the horizon: the Monte Forato mountain, one of the peaks of the Apuan Alps which is characterized by an impressive natural rock arch. Strikingly, Monte Forato's profile reproduces the so called "face" of the “Omo Disteso” (literally “Lying man”), about which there are various legends. An astronomical sense has been indeed found about the geographic axis of the two churche, which are turned towards the same point. Observing the sunset at winter solstice, from St. Frediano's church in Sommocolonia, we can see that the sunset point coincides with Monte Forato. While from St. Cristoforo's dome, the moonset point coincides with Monte Forato at the minor southern standstill. We may further observe that the moonset point coincides with the Monte Forato, at the major southern standstill, looking from the pre-Romanesque church (of Longobard age) St. Michele a Perpoli (Gallicano). Is it a fortuitous case? In this paper I will try to demonstrate that this system, of astronomic and geographic coincidence, originates from a form of religious syncretism which envisaged the construction of the churches in the ancient holy sites of the Ligures Apuan. The alignment system is perfectly identical to the one found in the British Islands (Ruggles, 1999) and in Sardinia (Zedda 1992; 2009; 2013). We are in front of an ancient custom of <b>building</b> <b>alignment</b> clearly widespread among people in prehistoric ages. Once the prehistoric peaple found a natural reference point, well-characterized on the horizon, they chose and they marked the observation point (with a menhir, a stone circle, a dolmen or something else) from where they could observe the Sun and the Moon rising and setting at a chosen view point in their standstill points...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of large, multiple-gene datasets, assembled from public sequence databases, is rapidly becoming a popular {{way to approach}} difficult phylogenetic problems. Supermatrices (concatenated multiple sequence alignments of multiple genes) can yield more phylogenetic signal than individual genes. However, manually assembling such datasets for a large taxonomic group is time-consuming and error-prone. Additionally, sequence curation, alignment and assessment {{of the results of}} phylogenetic analysis are made particularly difficult by the potential for a given gene in a given species to be unrepresented, or to be represented by multiple or partial sequences. We have developed a software package, TaxMan, that largely automates the processes of sequence acquisition, consensus <b>building,</b> <b>alignment</b> and taxon selection to facilitate this type of phylogenetic study. Results TaxMan uses freely available tools to allow rapid assembly, storage and {{analysis of}} large, aligned DNA and protein sequence datasets for user-defined sets of species and genes. The user provides GenBank format files and a list of gene names and synonyms for the loci to analyse. Sequences are extracted from the GenBank files on the basis of annotation and sequence similarity. Consensus sequences are built automatically. Alignment is carried out (where possible, at the protein level) and aligned sequences are stored in a database. TaxMan can automatically determine the best subset of taxa to examine phylogeny at a given taxonomic level. By using the stored aligned sequences, large concatenated multiple sequence alignments can be generated rapidly for a subset and output in analysis-ready file formats. Trees resulting from phylogenetic analysis can be stored and compared with a reference taxonomy. Conclusion TaxMan allows rapid automated assembly of a multigene datasets of aligned sequences for large taxonomic groups. By extracting sequences on the basis of both annotation and BLAST similarity, it ensures that all available sequence data can be brought to bear on a phylogenetic problem, but remains fast enough to cope with many thousands of records. By automatically assisting in the selection of the best subset of taxa to address a particular phylogenetic problem, TaxMan greatly speeds up the process of generating multiple sequence alignments for phylogenetic analysis. Our results indicate that an automated phylogenetic workbench can be a useful tool when correctly guided by user knowledge. </p...|$|E
40|$|Butrint, a World Heritage Site in {{southern}} Albania, encompasses 3000 years of Mediterranean {{history from the}} Hellenistic Greeks to the Venetians. In Roman times a suburb of Butrint spread out across the marsh plain {{to the south of}} the city, where approximately 20 ha have been surveyed with a fluxgate gradiometer, and 4 ha with a ground resistivity meter. The magnetic anomalies show that the line of the aqueduct into the centre of Butrint is evident for part of this area, but the aqueduct signature becomes progressively less distinct on approaching the Vivari Channel, probably owing to deeper burial. A complex of confused, short-wavelength anomalies, but with some linear elements covers about 3 ha and is associated with exposed building remains. The abrupt termination of these anomalies to the west may be associated with the former Roman water front. Isolated smaller areas of magnetic anomalies up to 0. 5 ha in the area surveyed, show buildings and associated ditches away from the main complex. The resistivity survey allows some detailed constraints on the position of buildings in the densely occupied area. Analysis of the orientation of linear anomalies indicates there are two co-genetic sets of magnetic and resistivity linear anomalies. A strong NW–SE and weaker NE–SW set, which parallel the aqueduct and the alignment of standing walls. This set appears to indicate a regular <b>building</b> <b>alignment</b> across the whole site, which is reflected in the orientation of the few current standing walls on the site. This set may post-date the building of the aqueduct, because these reflect the latest standing remains on the site. A second stronger set of E–W and (subsidiary) N–S linear anomalies may signify either an early system of streets, or perhaps an agricultural-based ditch system developed prior to the buildings on the site. This second set may pre-date the building of the aqueduct in the first century BC, when Butrint became a Roman colony. An alternative interpretation suggests part of the suburbs street plan may be based on a non-conventional triangular network of roadways, the design of which may have been emulated {{in the construction of the}} medieval Triangular Castle...|$|E

40|$|Tunnel {{construction}} {{entails the}} generation of ground settlements, which can endanger the adjacent buildings. The prediction of damages in buildings is usually based on the classical Gaussian profiles for the approximation of the subsidence trough and the equivalent beam method for modeling the response of building walls. Current available expressions refer to walls aligned transversally {{with respect to the}} tunnel axis, which usually represents the worst-case scenario. However, approximations must be done for other <b>building</b> <b>alignments,</b> since no analytical expressions are available for these cases. We propose a novel equation for the determination of the horizontal ground strain, which departs from the equations of the classical Gaussian settlement profiles. The novel formulation allows the application of the equivalent beam method in 3 D and the modeling of the tunnel advance. The results show significant variations of the estimated damage depending on the wall position with respect to the tunnel axis. The paper reviews also certain relevant aspects of building damage predictions, such as the influence area of settlements and the possible contribution of ground horizontal strain to damage reduction. A parametric analysis is further performed to create a non-linear regression model that allows direct estimation of the maximum tensile strain in a building wall according to input values of geological conditions and wall and tunnel geometries.
