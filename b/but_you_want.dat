5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E
500|$|Ben Parker's {{wife and}} Peter's aunt. Field said {{the main reason}} {{she felt she had}} to be in the film was because of {{producer}} Laura Ziskin (they worked together on the 1985 film Murphy's Romance) because she had an instinct that this was to be Ziskin's last film. After Ziskin's death Field expressed her gratitude at being a part of both Ziskin's first and last films. Director Webb felt that [...] "when you cast someone like Sally, they come with a certain level of awareness and real genuine affection, which for Aunt May is an incredibly important thing to have." [...] Webb said that while [...] "we all love Aunt May", he wanted to create a tension between May and Peter. [...] "He's got bruises on his face, and what happens in that moment? That can create some tension, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> there to be love there. That's what someone like Sally Field gives you." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{starts with}} an {{electric}} guitar riff comparable {{to the music of}} English alternative rock band Oasis. The chords harmonize with each other, continuing for 22 seconds. The techno melody then begins, consisting of a main synth sound oscillating on the primary musical note, with the EQ moving between the bass and the treble. The [...] "restless" [...] beat is accompanied by a rock-inspired chord riff, with Madonna's pitch being higher than the other tracks from the album. While recording, Orbit kept [...] "Ray of Light" [...] a semitone higher than the singer's limit, resulting in a strain added to the vocals. [...] "She got frustrated when we were recording <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> that bit of edge with singers, that thing of reaching. You can't fake it, and you can hear it when she cracks it on the record," [...] he recalled. Before the final chorus there is a synth solo again, reminiscent of a 1970s pro-rock record. According to Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, this was a link to the origin of the song from [...] "Sepheryn".|$|E

Ludacris' Word of Mouf and Mystikal's Tarantula were also nominated for Best Rap Album. Nelly also earned nominations for Album of the Year and Best Rap Album for the album Nellyville as well as Record of the Year and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for the song [...] "Dilemma" [...] (featuring Kelly Rowland), for a total five. Regarding his nominations, Nelly commented: [...] "It's always good to be nominated, especially for something {{as big as the}} Grammys. Just the recognition itself is an award. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> that little gold record player. You just want to take it home." [...] The award for Best Male Rap Solo Performance was presented to Nelly at Madison Square Garden in New York City, though not broadcast on television. His performances of [...] "Hot in Herre" [...] and [...] "Dilemma" [...] alongside Rowland at the awards ceremony included pyrotechnics. In addition, Nelly received the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.|$|E

Sticky {{would go on to}} comment that he was not out to make people forget about the Blade films, but he also wanted to put his own spin on the character. [...] "I think it's more my own direction, but I have to incorporate some of what [...] did," [...] he said. [...] "That's what people are familiar with, and you don't want to change it up drastically. You might want to change the seasoning a little bit, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> the same meat." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008 season, {{prior to}} the hiring of Gaston, the Blue Jays had a record of 35–39. Once Gaston and his coaches took over the Blue Jays went 51–37 to finish with an 86–76 record. The {{offensive}} improvements under Gaston {{were one of the}} reasons for the resurgence and as the hitting coach, Tenace was credited with rejuvenating a stagnant offense. Adam Lind commented: [...] "The thing is, a lot of people can teach you how to hit, but not a lot of people can teach you how to hit in the big leagues", referring to the major league experience of Gaston and Tenace.Blue Jays' former center fielder Vernon Wells has said he likes the approach to hitting that Tenace teaches: [...] "One thing Gene talks about is having that approach mentally when you go up there, in your mind you already guarantee yourself that one run on third, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do more than that. Gene always says that first runner is a gimme, you should be able to come through in pretty much every situation like that. And then you try to do more damage than just that one run".|$|E

2500|$|Scenes {{shot at the}} United Palace theater {{created new}} {{challenges}} for the series' stunt team due to {{not being able to}} drill holes in the historic building for creating anchors for wire rigs and other complex stunts. The crew had to find other ways to weigh down the equipment to remain safe for the actors and stunt doubles. For the explosion at the restaurant [...] "Genghis Connie's", a practical explosion was created in the storefront on location, which was extended with visual effects to show the destruction of the building. A set showing the inside of the rubble of the destroyed building was then created on a soundstage, while a lot was found that [...] "feels" [...] similar to the original location, where rubble could by piled and fire trucks could be brought to show the exterior. The lot was previously being used to store vehicles that had been seized as evidence, with the production having to negotiate with the NYPD to have the vehicles moved elsewhere. Looking back on the filming style of the season, and comparing it to the previous Marvel Netflix series, Weeks said,"You want it to feel like it's all in the same city, all in the same time frame, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> each show, each character to feel a little different. Have its own visual identity. Some of that is lighting, and of course, some of that is production design and location work ... We embraced Harlem for exactly what it is. The color, the life, the activity on the streets. There's so much character to the neighborhood… I think it was important to feel that these characters were rooted in the real place". The series' production sound mixer Joshua Anderson, who worked on Daredevil and Jessica Jones as well, worked to capture as much sound on set with boom mics over lavaliers to ground the unbelievable elements of the series in [...] "naturalistic sound". He noted that Ali's Cottonmouth laugh and many of Colter's lines in particular sounded [...] "incredible on the boom". Anderson also talked about Luke Cage adding a new layer of sound that the other series did not—music. The captured sound had to be clear to be properly mixed in with music later, and live performances in Harlem's Paradise had to be recorded for which Anderson and his team had experience after working on the musical series Smash.|$|E
