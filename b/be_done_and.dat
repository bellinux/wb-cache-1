5|$|The common {{term for}} a place at which one may dive is a dive site. As a general rule, {{professional}} diving is done where the work needs to <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> recreational diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which {{are known for their}} convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions. Diver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the risk is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|Collier {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied. Friends and relations had become increasingly concerned about his mental state as a result. His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home, but Collier appears to have smuggled one to his room, and used it to cut his own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824. His servant who was sleeping in the same room immediately brought help, but nothing could <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>and</b> Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury. The inquest later determined that 'The deceased destroyed himself, being in a state of temporary mental derangement.' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E

In 1898, he founded L'Année Sociologique, the first French social science journal. Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, {{he published}} Suicide, a case study that provided an example of what the sociological monograph might look like. Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of quantitative methods in criminology during his suicide case study.|$|E

5|$|Jonah Bevan (Oliver Ferriman) {{is walking}} home across the Cardiff Bay Barrage when a mysterious bright light appears. He vanishes. Seven months later, at the {{instigation}} {{of her former}} police colleague Andy Davidson (Tom Price), Torchwood agent Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) is investigating Jonah's disappearance. After Jonah's mother Nikki (Ruth Jones) starts {{a support group for}} relatives of missing people in the Cardiff area, Gwen realises that there are more cases resembling Jonah's disappearance. Gwen collates a chart of the missing people and her colleague Toshiko (Naoko Mori) discovers that all the disappearances occurred during negative spikes of activity from the Cardiff space-time rift. The two women postulate the implications of this: that the rift can take people away and discard them elsewhere. Gwen confronts her boss Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) with her research but he informs her that nothing can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>and</b> orders her to stop the investigation.|$|E
5|$|She {{then moves}} {{out onto a}} dock, where she meets Ben Linus. Juliet is shown {{operating}} with Ethan and Goodwin (Brett Cullen) on a pregnant patient, Sabine, who dies; she is comforted by Goodwin. Juliet meets with Ben, and explains her theory that the problems with pregnant women happen at conception. She wants to test this theory by having a woman conceive off the island, but Ben refuses to let anyone off the island. When Juliet tells him that nothing else can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>and</b> asks {{to go home and}} be with her sister, Ben informs Juliet that her sister's cancer has come back. He offers her a choice: either Juliet can go home and be with her sister as she dies, or she can stay and he will have Jacob cure her sister's cancer.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Berkman turned 12, {{his father}} died. The {{business}} {{had to be}} sold, and the family lost the right to live in Saint Petersburg. Yetta moved the family to Kovno, where her brother Nathan lived. Berkman had shown great promise {{as a student at}} the gymnasium, but his studies began to falter as he spent his time reading novels. One of the books that interested him was Ivan Turgenev's novel Fathers and Sons (1862), with its discussion of nihilist philosophy. But what truly moved him was Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 novel, What Is to <b>Be</b> <b>Done?,</b> <b>and</b> Berkman felt inspired by Rakhmetov, its puritanical protagonist who is willing to sacrifice personal pleasure and family ties in single-minded pursuit of his revolutionary aims.|$|E

5|$|In February, as the ice {{bridge and}} snow road were {{carrying}} tracked vehicles north, Alyeska awarded {{a contract to}} design the construction and maintenance road. Michael Baker, Jr., Inc., a firm in Pennsylvania, was awarded the contract. To cross the Yukon River, the state of Alaska designed a bridge and paid two-thirds of its cost. The remaining third was paid by Alyeska, and the bridge was built by Manson-Osberg-Ghemm. On April 5, the contracts to build the road were picked. In total, the new Dalton Highway cost $185 million to build, and four companies shared that cost. Construction of the Dalton Highway started on April 29, and {{at the peak of}} the effort, Alyeska and the four subcontractors had more than 3,400 workers deployed from the Yukon River to Prudhoe Bay. A massive airlift was created to supply the road construction effort; more than 700 flights per day—170,000 in total—were required before the road was finished on September 29. In just 154 days, a 360-mile gravel road had been built. Final grading had to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>and</b> more than 20 small permanent bridges had to be built, but by November, the road was open to traffic crossing the Yukon River on another ice bridge.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1902, Geier began a long cruise {{south to}} the Dutch East Indies, which also {{included}} a stop in Singapore. The ship entered the dry dock in Nagasaki, Japan, for a major overhaul on 2 March 1903, which lasted until 26 April. At this time, Geier was formally assigned to the East Asia Squadron. The ship resumed its normal routine of cruises in East Asian waters with stops in various ports. In February 1904, the Russo-Japanese War broke out; from April to August, Geier was in Chemulpo, which had been captured by the Japanese. By 1905, the ship was suffering wear, having spent over seven years on foreign stations. The repair facilities in Tsingtao were insufficient {{for the amount of}} work that needed to <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> so Geier was ordered to return to Germany. She left Tsingtao on 14 January and arrived in Kiel on 16 March, where she was decommissioned for a significant period of repair work. Her three-masted schooner barque rig was reduced to a two-masted topsail schooner rig.|$|E
