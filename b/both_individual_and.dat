5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; {{and how they are}} enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of deviance, which includes <b>both</b> <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> system level causal explanations of deviance.|$|E

Of those, three participated only in individual track events (Sasha Springer-Jones, Aleesha Barber, Josanne Lucas); three participated in individual field events (Rhonda Watkins, Cleopatra Borel-Brown, and Candice Scott); two participated in only team track events (Wanda Hutson and Ayanna Hutchinson); and two participated in <b>both</b> <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> team track events (Kelly-Ann Baptiste and Semoy Hackett).

5|$|Mainstream opinion {{reflects}} {{the function of}} identification with a sports team in <b>both</b> <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> group psychology. There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences. Daniel Snyder explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name. When self-esteem becomes bound to {{the players and the}} team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior. However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, with the defense of native mascots clearly racist.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-one athletes {{composed}} the male Jamaican {{track and field}} team that participated in Beijing, comprising {{over a third of}} the Jamaican Olympic delegation at the 2008 Olympics. Of those twenty, eleven (Anderson, Williams, R. Phillips, Wignall, I. Phillips, McFarlane, Buckley, Sappleton, Smith, Scott, McGregor) only participated in individual events; four participated only in team events (Carter, Thomas, Fothergill, Spence); and six competed in <b>both</b> <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> team events (Bolt, Frater, Powell, Blackwood, Chambers, Ayre). Over a quarter of the medals won by Jamaica in Beijing were won by its male track team, including two singular events (men's 100meters and the men's 200meters, both by Usain Bolt) and one relay team (men's 4x100meters relay, including Thomas, Frater, Carter, Powell, and Bolt). Usain Bolt held the record for medals won by a Jamaican at the Beijing games, medaling gold in every event in which he participated.|$|E
5|$|Rembrandt and Uphoff also competed at {{many other}} international-level events. In 1989, Rembrandt made his European Dressage Championships debut at Mondorf, Luxembourg, where they took <b>both</b> <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> team gold. It {{was the first}} time that the gold-medal winning German team (which had also won the {{previous}} 12 team golds) had been made up of four female riders. In 1991, at the Championships in Donaueschingen, Germany, the pair took silver in the Grand Prix Special, while again riding to gold as part of the German team. The silver medal was the first defeat in three years for the pair, and was dealt by another Schulten-Baumer student, Isabell Werth on Gigolo FRH. At the 1995 Championships, held in Mondorf, Luxembourg, Rembrandt again assisted the German team to a gold medal, while taking 5th individually. The pair also won seven times at the Stuttgart German Masters international show, the last in 1995. This was a record number of wins until 2010, when Werth won for an eighth time, and Uphoff remains the only rider to have won seven masters titles on a single horse (Werth rode three different horses to her eight victories).|$|E
