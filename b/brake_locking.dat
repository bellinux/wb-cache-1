25|$|Qualifying {{took place}} in warm weather conditions. In {{the first group of}} five runners, where all drivers elected to take time to {{increase}} tyre temperature, Rosenqvist paced the session, half a second faster than second-placed Engel and Sarrazin was third. Piquet was fourth-fastest, while Heidfeld was affected by a throttle sensor malfunction that prevented him from recording a maximum power lap. After completing his lap, Heidfeld stopped his car on the track to rectify the problem which caused him to start {{at the back of the}} grid. Buemi drove cleanly was the fastest driver in the second group; Abt was 0.013 seconds slower than Buemi in second and Prost third. Dillmann and Carroll (who missed the turn nine apex) were the slowest drivers of the second group. In the third group, López recorded the fastest time, ahead of Turvey and di Grassi. Evans took fourth and Félix da Costa rounded out the top five. Despite losing time in the second sector, Bird set the fastest overall time of any competitor in the group qualifying stages in the fourth group at one minute and 7.805 seconds. Vergne was second-fastest, ahead of the Dragon pairing of Duval and d'Ambrosio. Frijns was the slowest driver in the fourth group, and at the end of group qualifying, the times set by Bird, López, Vergne, Buemi and Rosenqvist were fast enough to enable progression into super pole. Rosenqvist clinched the second position of his career with a time of one minute and 8.208 seconds despite contending with an oversteering car. He was joined on the grid's front row by Buemi who recorded a lap 0.098 seconds slower than Rosenqvist. López struggled with wheelspin, and lost time with oversteer entering turn six, restricting him to third. Bird was close to Rosenqvist's pace in the first sector, but took fourth after drifting slightly through the seventh turn. Vergne struggled with his car's handling because of oversteer and persistent <b>brake</b> <b>locking,</b> causing him to start from fifth place.|$|E

50|$|The {{design of}} squad trucks varies, {{depending}} on the geography and need in any given area. Areas with rough terrain or snow usually have squad trucks with four-wheel drive, jake <b>brake,</b> <b>locking</b> differentials, hydraulic brakes, and aggressive tires. Often, squads trucks are old ambulances that have been stripped to carry the necessary tools and equipment needed for an extrication, however, rescue squads or fire departments with a high amount of funding often purchase custom trucks that are more elaborate and functional squad trucks. As such, the size of squad trucks is varying, and can be classified into three distinct categories. Class I, or light duty squad trucks are the smallest, and usually the cheapest squad trucks. They can range from a converted ambulance or Chevy Suburban type truck, to custom built trucks on Ford F550 chassis. Class II, or medium duty squad trucks are substantially bigger in both the physical size {{of the truck and}} its weight. Medium duty squad trucks can range from smaller fire engines specifically designed for extrications to International truck cabs and chassis. Class III, or heavy duty squad trucks are usually the dimensions of a full sized fire engine and often include more exotic tools such as cascade systems and plasma torches.|$|E

40|$|A {{railway wheel}} flat is a flat {{spot on the}} rolling surface of a wheel caused by its unintentional sliding on the rail. The reason for the sliding may be poorly adjusted, frozen or defect brakes, or too high braking forces in {{relation}} to the available wheel/rail adhesion. Contaminations on the rail such as leaves, grease, frost and snow aggravate the problem. The temperature rise caused by the sliding, and the rapid cooling into the adjacent material when the wheel starts rolling again, may lead to formation of brittle martensite around the flat. The thermal impact and the phase transformations will generate large residual stresses. The residual stress field will interact with the rolling contact stresses and it will promote the formation and growth of cracks. Another consequence of wheel flats on a rolling wheelset is impact loading on bearings and suspensions and on rails, sleepers, bridges, etc. A numerical model for the prediction of martensite formation is proposed. The model is based on a commercial FE-code, enhanced by subroutines to handle the phase transformations and describe the thermal load. Features and limitations of the model are examined. A parametric study is performed in order to determine those combinations of thermal load and <b>brake</b> <b>locking</b> time which lead to considerable martensite formation. The effect of modifications of material parameters is investigated. A constitutive model is developed for the calculation of stresses in a material going through phase transformations. Transformation plasticity and plastic hardening memory loss during phase transformations are handled. The model is implemented in a commercial FE-code. Simulations indicate large residual stresses beneath the martensitic area of the wheel flat. Extensive full-scale field experiments have been designed, performed and evaluated. More than 200 wheel flats were formed under controlled conditions involving different wheel loads, train speeds and sliding durations. Also the friction coefficient between the wheel and the rail was varied (and indirectly measured). Samples extracted from the tested wheels were metallographically examined with respect to phase transformations and cracks around the flat. The numerical model for prediction of martensite formation was qualitatively verified and quantitatively calibrated. In the experiments, martensite was found beneath all flats, and cracks were observed in most cases. It is concluded that the risk for future spalling in the wheel tread should be considered for all wheelsets with flats. A damaged wheelset should be taken out of service as quickly as possible. When reprofiling the wheels, all martensite and also an additional layer of several millimeters should be machined off...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} report for MOU 313, "Lateral Control of Heavy Vehicles for Automated Highway Systems". It address the {{following}} task items: Analysis and synthesis of control algorithms based on system identification and calibration results (Task 4. in the MPU), Closed loop results at highway speeds (Task 5), limits and persormance of sensors, actuators and control schemes as infered from data collected during closed loop experiments at 55 MPH (task 6) and baseline safety requirements based on closed loop data (task 7) Five controllers were designed based on the model identification study conducted on the previous phase of the project. This report will present the details of eash design methodology: Nonlinear Robust Loop Shaping, Robust controller based on Feedback linearization, Gain -Scheduled H 1, Robust H 1 and Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) controllers. The sysnthesis of each controller is sufficiently complex to merit a separate Chapter. These Chapters address Task 4 in detail. Closed loop experiments were performed for Robust H 1, nonlinear Sliding Mode Control (SMC) and LPV contorller. The results of these closed loop experiments will be presented in the Chapters that detail the control design respectively and address Task 5. One of the control strategies, Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) was developed to address issues arising from variation in dynamics {{with the speed of}} the vehicle. Data collected from Robust H 1 controller, which is designed for fixed speed, indicated that an LPV control strategy may work better for good steering control over a wide range of speeds. The gain scheduled H 1 controller was also designed to address automated operation over a range of velocity. The closed loop experiment results showed that the sensors (range, sensitivity and noise characteristics) on the experimental vehicle were adequate for effective automated steering at 55 MPH. Lateral deviation measurement sensors were adequate in range and sensitivity. Yaw rate and acceleration sensors were adequate for system identification but inadequate for effec-tive implementation of nonlinear control strategies. Actuator performance was adequate (with bandwidth in excess of 10 Hz) for 400 m step curvature change at 55 MPH. Performance of the closed loop controller as characterised by tracking accuracy at high speeds has been excellent. The LPV controller has been tested up to 70 MPH. The limited length of track at Crow's Land-ing test site and large inertia of the truck semi-trailer vehicle posed limitations on testing the controllers to the "limit". However, the authors are pleased to report that the LPV controller provided smooth steering action with adequate tracking performance from start of the track un-der maximum possible acceleration to the end of track with aggressive deceleration (occasional <b>brake</b> <b>locking).</b> The curve transitions at Crow's Landing test site are aggressive and unlikely to exist at real highways. In that sense, the range of present sensors and performance of present controller and actuator was tested under limiting conditions and configuration on the test vehicle was deemed adequate. These conclusions addresses Task 6. LPV model based controller emerged to be the right "supervisory controller" which com-bines information from longitudinal sensor (velocity) and imposes restriction on the longitudinal controller in terms of maximum allowed deceleration and maximum allowed aceleration. This addresses Task 7 of MOU 313. A video of the controllers was taken at the Crow's Landing test site and is available at PATH Publications office and on the PATH web site. A copy is included with this report. Report is organized in Chapters. First two Chapters presents Nonlinear Controllers which have sound robustness properties but are sensitive to sensor noise. Subsequent Chapters present Robust H 1 contoller and Gain Scheduled Controller. Finally the last Chapter will propose LPV controller as a method to combine the benefits of converting the vehicle model nonlinear in velocity to a linear time varying model with velocity as the measured parameter and utilizing rich tool set of Linear H 1 based control design. Each Chapter is self sufficient in content. This allows reader to read Chapters in any order or preference. Conclusions presented in the last Chapter tie the lessons from each different controller. ...|$|E
