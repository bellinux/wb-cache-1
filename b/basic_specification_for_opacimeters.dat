40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a routing technique, “recursive Loop-Free Alternates (rLFAs) ”, to {{alleviate}} packet loss due to transient link failures. The technique {{consists of a}} backup path calculation with corresponding re-routing scheme based on the Loop-Free Condition (LFC) as defined in the <b>basic</b> <b>specification</b> <b>for</b> IP Fast Re-Route (IPFRR). Under this routing strategy, nodes calculate backup paths by modifying the weights of links in the primary shortest path tree. If a failure occurs, the detecting node determines the number of recursions, which indicates {{the number of times}} packets must be forwarded along the alternate next hops to bypass the failed link. This technique guarantees full repair coverage for single link failures. We evaluate the performance of our proposed technique through simulations and show that the incurred overheads, the stretch of its pre-computed alternate paths, and the failure-state Maximum Link Utilisation (MLU) are minimal.

30|$|An {{alternative}} {{structural approach}} which {{we use to}} represent each workflow is based on graphs as <b>basic</b> <b>specifications</b> <b>for</b> workflow structures. With the graph based representations of workflows we can benefit from the previous graph based search and analyze methods. Collective classification model is proposed in this paper to overcome the granularity of workflow components and this model is used in different workflow domains not only scientific workflow or business workflow. Main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, it shows how to adapt knowledge acquired from structured and unstructured data of different domains. Finally, it gives an algorithm learning common features; namely, concepts, as domain independent conceptual abstractions for workflow steps. For {{the purpose of this}} paper we embed sample workflow graphs in vector spaces to benefit from both the universality of graphs for workflow representation and the convenience of embedded features for pattern recognition to obtain similarities between workflows. We train a model that learns representational embeddings for motifs from a large collection of unlabeled data using a generative model. We view the training method as a problem of cross-domain concept extraction of different workflows.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—IP Fast ReRoute (IPFRR) is the IETF {{standard}} for providing fast failure protection in IP and MPLS/LDP networks and Loop Free Alternates (LFA) is a <b>basic</b> <b>specification</b> <b>for</b> implementing it. Even though LFA {{is simple and}} unobtrusive, it has a significant drawback: it does not guarantee protection for all possible failure cases. Consequently, many IPFRR proposals have appeared lately, promising full failure coverage {{at the price of}} added complexity and non-trivial modifications to IP hardware and software. Meanwhile, LFA remains the only commercially available, and therefore, the only deployable IPFRR solution. Deployment, however, crucially depends {{on the extent to which}} LFA can protect failures in operational networks. In this paper, therefore, we revisit LFA in order to give theoretical insights and practical hints to LFA failure coverage analysis. First, we identify the topological properties a network must possess to profit from good failure coverage. Then, we study how coverage varies as new links are added to a network, we show how to do this optimally and, through extensive simulations, we arrive to the conclusion that cleverly adding just a couple of new links can improve the quality of LFA protection drastically...|$|R

40|$|The {{starting}} point of Sub-task 1 {{is to determine the}} full LHC system requirements for the crab cavity system. This milestone concerns completion of <b>basic</b> <b>specifications</b> <b>for</b> the crab cavity system. This comprises the beam requirements, the cavity impedance constraints, the operating conditions and constraints, the layout and integration constraints in LHC and very importantly machine protection issues. The specifications of the cavity itself and its ancillaries follow from these system requirements and on the technology chosen for the cavity design. The beam requirements result from the known parameters of the LHC upgrade lattice and the expected LHC beam parameters at ultimate bunch intensity. There are boundary conditions imposed by certain beam parameters such as the bunch length and intensity and by the machine layout, mainly the available beam pipe separations at the proposed cavity positions. Requirements on RF noise and stability are tight, to avoid emittance blow-up. Machine protection issues arise from the need for safe operation to be maintained under all circumstances, requiring any potentially dangerous situation to be signaled to the beam dump system a period of at least three revolutions before any damage can occur. RF power and cryogenics must also be defined, as well as appropriate operating scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Little doubt {{exists that}} {{technologies}} for precisely, and automatically measuring energy use are timely. Pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, {{the potential for}} a generation shortfall, and rising energy prices, modern building complexities, mean that estimating building energy use patterns, profiling of building energy use, and energy failure mode identification can help to maintain energy efficiency. However, further uses exist beyond operational management; These include urgently required meta-analysis of building stock by sector, up to national stock levels, to inform policymakers, since a dearth of national stock data exists at government level in many countries. Many existing systems use radio telemetry, often producing unclean data. Analysis of energy data for large datasets becomes expensive due to incompatible formats, hampering use of old data on new systems, and data from different systems should we acquire new data, or as we acquire physical buildings. We argue that a standard should include <b>basic</b> <b>specifications</b> <b>for</b> fundamentals such as date formats, but a secondary scalable layer will allow future-proofing of datasets for longitudinal study, and open the door to advanced analysis techniques such as complex event processing. Disaggregation to plant level, as well as building related activities, such as manufacturing activity, also becomes possible with a scalable data structure.

The model was estimated with quarterly data to allow the assumption of predetermined beef import levels and total beef consumption was disaggregated into table and processing quality classes to avoid the possibility of bias from mis-classification of some low quality beef under the fed/nonfed classification procedure. The <b>basic</b> <b>specifications</b> <b>for</b> the model equations were derived from economic theory with modification for the capital-good nature of livestock inventories and policy intervention in the feed grain market. The model was stable, with cyclical patterns corresponding to both the cattle and the hog cycle;The estimated impacts {{of changes in the}} level of beef imports were generally in line with the estimates obtained from earlier studies. Comparison of the factors influencing the excess demand for imports, and the beef import quota, revealed some divergent trends. An increase in corn prices, for instance, increased the long-run excess demand but reduced the import quota, while an increase in consumer incomes increased the quota but had virtually no effect on the level of excess demand for beef;Comparison of estimates obtained using the fed/nonfed and table/processing approaches to disaggregation suggested that the bias resulting from use of the fed/nonfed approach may tend to underestimate the effect of imports on U.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 56 - 58. The {{concept of}} Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing {{has been around}} since the 1960 s. It has resurfaced over the last decade as being the {{modulation}} scheme of choice in some newer technologies like Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and Asynchronous Digital Subscriber lines (ADSL). Amateur packet radio started in 1978 and has attracted thousands of enthusiasts from around the world. The interest in packet radio has waned over the years due advances in the data transmission capabilities oflandline systems and also more widespread access to the Internet. The purpose of this thesis was to develop a simple software simulation model {{to determine whether or not}} OFDM could be used to increase the data rates currently available in packet radio systems. The thesis starts out with an introduction to packet radio and OFDM in Chapter 1. A slightly more detailed discussion on OFDM is given in Chapter 2 in order to develop a <b>basic</b> <b>specification</b> <b>for</b> the proposed OFDM model. Chapters 2, 3 and 4 discuss the development of the Transmitter model, the Receiver model and the Channel model respectively using the Simulink software package. Chapter 6 discusses the problem of Peak-to-Average Power Ratios (PAPR) in OFDM and explores the use of A-law companding to reduce this problem. In Chapter 7, the developed models are simulated and their performance compared to theoretical expectations. The full system is also simulated in this chapter in order to ascertain the possible data rate through the modelled packet radio channel. Conclusions regarding the application of OFDM to packet radio are presented in Chapter 8...|$|R

40|$|For the {{development}} of the preliminary design of a dry dock, the present design methods are based on information from experience and manuals. Dry docks are not as frequently designed and built as other maritime structures and due to this many information is lost in time. To improve the process for the preliminary design of dry docks this thesis has investigated the implementation of existing and new design methods for the creation of the preliminary design of dry docks. In the design process of dry docks the first design stages: sketch design, conceptual design and preliminary design are of interest for a DSS, in these phases the design is still on main elements. For these phases engineering firms uses the design manuals on dry docks and experience from designers for the design. In this research the new techniques System Engineering (SE), Decision Support System (DSS) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) are used. SE is used to create in a systematic and structured way a parametric design {{that can be used for}} the DSS. The DSS determines the first estimation of the design for a dry dock in a quick and objective manner. To create the preliminary design of a dry dock following SE, the first step is the creation of the <b>basic</b> <b>specification</b> <b>for</b> a dry dock. The <b>basic</b> <b>specification</b> is based out of firstly the Functional Flow Block Diagram, from this diagram all the functions of a dry dock are mapped. To fulfil to these functions from the diagram, objects need to build. These objects are described by the object decomposition. From this object decomposition it becomes clear that the walls, floor and gates needs to be designed for the preliminary design of a dry dock. Finally the requirements are described, the requirements consist out of functional requirements and technical requirements. The technical requirements are used to check which objects are possible for the specific project and to create a parametric design for these objects. The functional requirements are used to rank the possible types within a trade-off matrix. The design of the DSS is created in Excel and with the guidance of the literature study on DSS and the design rules. The DSS gives guidance on which option for construction method, wall type, floor type and gate type are possible and preferred in the preliminary design of a dry dock. The capability to use an alternative is checked by comparing the technical requirements for the different types with the project specific situation. When the types that are possible are determined, these types are weighted against the functional requirements by means of a trade-off matrix, from where they are ranked. To investigate if this generic design method for the preliminary design of a dry dock is implementable a verification and validation is performed. The verification determined if the calculations made in the DSS are correct. This is done by checking the embedded anchored walls and concrete calculations with verified computer programs. For the embedded anchored walls the program D-Sheet piling is used and for the concrete calculation SCIA engineering is used. The validation checks the outcome of the DSS is realistic, by comparing the design of the DSS with the design of a case study from Arcadis. Despite the oversimplification the DSS gives a quick preliminary design for the main objects of a dry dock. This design is inline with the case study, however it is only validated with one case study. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
