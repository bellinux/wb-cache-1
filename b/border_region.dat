40|$|<b>Border</b> <b>regions</b> and <b>border</b> effects {{currently}} {{attract a}} lot of attention in political practice and economic research. Substantial interest in regions located along the frontiers of integrating countries is predominantly inspired by the presumption that their specific geographic position might cause peculiarities in economic adjustments to integration. This survey explores whether economic theory and empirical studies support the assessment that integration effects concentrate in <b>border</b> <b>regions.</b> Economic theory alone allows only very vague conclusions about the spatial effects of integration. Depending on specific circumstances, <b>border</b> <b>regions</b> might benefit, lose or not be affected by integration. Empirical research on <b>border</b> <b>regions</b> - undertaken so far - does not allow to draw clear-cut conclusions as well. At present, there is neither a direct test for integration effects in <b>border</b> <b>regions,</b> nor a comprehensive study on the development of <b>border</b> <b>regions.</b> To sum up, the survey suggests that rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis is needed to foster the understanding of integration effects in <b>border</b> <b>regions.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{socioeconomic}} transformations in the Russian Federation, the openness of <b>border</b> <b>regions</b> under the influence of integration process taking place in the world community facilitates tourist mobility between neighbouring countries. The author describes an approach that considers the <b>border</b> <b>regions</b> of Northwest Russia as attractive destinations for tourists from neighbouring countries. The development of cross-border tourism as a specific form characteristic of only <b>border</b> <b>regions</b> is one of key areas of tourism development in these regions. An assessment of the prospects of developing cross-border tourism in the <b>border</b> <b>regions</b> of Russian Northwest becomes a relevant research objective. The author identifies the specific features and general trends in the development of cross-border tourism in the Russian regions in question. It is proven that Russian <b>border</b> <b>regions</b> are less competitive than the territories of neighbouring states in terms of the development of crossborder tourism. The author also points out to the avenues of stimulating cross-border tourism development in Russian <b>border</b> <b>regions.</b> ...|$|R

This paper deals with the effects of integration on labour markets in <b>border</b> <b>regions.</b> Within the framework of different theoretical approaches, the effects of integration on labour markets in <b>border</b> <b>regions</b> are analysed. Furthermore, we investigate empirically the degree of labour market integration in European <b>border</b> <b>regions.</b> As indicators for the intensity of integration among neighbouring labour markets measures of spatial association are applied.

Conservationists became aware as early as the 1970s that the border had become a refuge for rare species of animals and plants. Their findings led the Bavarian government to begin a programme of buying land along the border to ensure its protection from development.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to Baghdad, Bahá'u'lláh tried to revive the Bábí community, mostly through correspondence, writing {{extensively}} to give the Bábís {{a new understanding of}} the Bábí religion, while keeping his perceived station as the one promised by the Báb and a Manifestation of God hidden. He was soon recognized by the Bábís, as well as government authorities, as the foremost Bábí leader, and there was {{a growing number of people}} joining the Bábí movement. He also gained sympathy from government officials and Sunni clerics. Bahá'u'lláh's rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian Bábí community, gained the attention of his enemies in Islamic clergy and the Persian government. The Persian government asked the Ottoman government to extradite Bahá'u'lláh to Persia, but the Ottoman government refused and instead chose to move Bahá'u'lláh from the sensitive <b>border</b> <b>region</b> to Constantinople.|$|E

Catching the Byzantines off guard, he quickly captured several towns, virtually cutting off the communications of the Byzantine army at Ajnadayn with its high command at Emesa, where emperor Heraclius himself resided.|$|E
5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} had a {{much harder}} time, because the country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The <b>border</b> <b>region</b> was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay. The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston {{was once}} more forced into exile, but Edward {{recalled}} him {{in less than}} a year. The king had spent the intervening time gathering support, and at the time, the only one to resist the return of Gaveston was Warwick. With time, however, opposition to the king grew. Another source of contention was Edward abandoning his father's Scottish campaigns, a policy that opened the <b>Border</b> <b>region</b> up to devastating raids from the Scots. This affected Warwick greatly, with his extensive landed interest in the north. Tensions grew {{to the point where the}} king in 1310 had to ban Warwick and others from arriving at parliament in arms. They still did, and at the parliament of March 1310, the king was forced to accept the appointment of a commission to draft a set of ordinances towards reform the royal government.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects of}} the border on Chinese direct investments to Russian <b>border</b> <b>regions.</b> The findings of this paper show that Chinese direct investments to Russia gravitated to industries in the <b>border</b> <b>regions</b> exporting their goods to China and to the production of non-tradable goods in non-border regions. The net Chinese foreign direct investments (FDI) inflow to Russian <b>border</b> <b>regions</b> is very small but the development of border trade led to informal investments between Russian and Chinese <b>border</b> <b>regions.</b> The case study of Amur oblast suggests that informal Chinese investments go to the sectors associated with trade: logging (raw timber primarily exported to China), construction of shopping malls, wholesale and retail. The results suggest that the amount of informal Chinese investments significantly exceeds the amount of formal investments...|$|R

5|$|Under President Antonio López de Santa Anna, the Mexican {{government}} began to {{shift away from}} a federalist model. The increasingly dictatorial policies, including the revocation of the Constitution of 1824 in early 1835, incited many federalists to revolt. The <b>border</b> <b>region</b> of Mexican Texas was largely populated by immigrants from the United States. These people were accustomed to a federalist government and to extensive individual rights, and they were quite vocal in their displeasure at Mexico's shift towards centralism. Already suspicious after previous American attempts to purchase Mexican Texas, Mexican authorities blamed much of the Texian unrest on American immigrants, most of whom had made little effort {{to adapt to the}} Mexican culture.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the Canadian Prime Minister, Sir John Macdonald, {{made plans}} to create a 200-strong mounted police force to {{maintain}} order along the border; such a force, he thought, would enable the colonisation {{of the region and}} be much cheaper than deploying regular military units for the task. The implementation of this proposal was delayed, however, first by the rebellion of the Métis, and then by the threat of a Fenian invasion. Meanwhile, a survey conducted in 1871 by Lieutenant William Butler recommended establishing a mounted force of up to 150 men under a magistrate or commissioner, based along the northern trade routes, leaving the border area as a liminal, ungarrisoned zone. Colonel Patrick Robertson-Ross conducted another survey in 1872, and recommended an alternate strategy of recruiting a larger force of 550 men who would be tasked to push south into the <b>border</b> <b>region</b> itself and establish law and order there.|$|E
5|$|In case of war, Yugoslav {{planners}} saw the 1st Cavalry Division {{forming the}} bulk of the reserve for the 1st Army Group. The 1st Army Group was responsible for the defence of northwestern Yugoslavia, with the 4th Army defending the eastern sector along the Hungarian border, and the 7th Army along the Reich and Italian borders. The 1st Cavalry Division was to be held as the 1st Army Group reserve around Zagreb. On the left of the 4th Army, the boundary with the 7th Army ran from Gornja Radgona on the Mura through Krapina and Karlovac to Otočac. On the right of the 4th Army was the 2nd Army of the 2nd Army Group, with the boundary running from just east of Slatina through Požega towards Banja Luka. The Yugoslav defence plan saw both armies deployed in a cordon, the 4th Army behind the Drava river between Varaždin and Slatina, and the 7th Army along the <b>border</b> <b>region</b> from the Adriatic in the west to Gornja Radgona in the east. It was envisaged that this reserve would be located in and around Zagreb. The planners estimated that cavalry formations would take 4–7 days to mobilise.|$|E
