5|$|Cow Tower formed part of {{the city}} defences during the 15th century, with the Crown {{occasionally}} issuing instructions that it should <b>be</b> <b>repaired.</b> In 1450 St Giles Hospital formally transferred any rights they had to the tower and the immediately surrounding land to the city. The population of Norwich grew significantly from 1500 onwards and the city continued to maintain the urban defences; like other towers and gatehouses belonging to the city, however, by this period the Cow Tower was probably leased out to a merchant or craftsman when not in military use.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to DNA damage, a mutation {{is a change}} in the base sequence of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot <b>be</b> <b>repaired.</b> At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s the central vault {{ceiling of the}} main {{sanctuary}} cracked, and had to <b>be</b> <b>repaired.</b> At that time the pulpit was also rebuilt, so that the rabbi and cantor had separate pulpits. Underneath the sanctuary ran an underground stream which would regularly overflow, leading to flooding problems. The flooding was fixed in the 1950s with the installation of check valves, and a concrete slab floor was installed. Though the intent was to provide usable space in the basement, it was rarely used.|$|E
5|$|In {{two small}} studies of two {{patients}} and another with one patient suffering from recurrent CSF leaks where repeated blood patches failed to form clots and relieve symptoms, the patients received temporary but complete resolution of symptoms with an epidural saline infusion.
