500|$|Though several etymologies {{have been}} {{suggested}} for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that Karnataka {{is derived from the}} Kannada words karu and nādu, meaning [...] "elevated land". Karu nadu may also be read as karu, meaning [...] "black", and nadu, meaning [...] "region", as a reference to the <b>black</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>soil</b> found in the Bayalu Seeme region of the state. The British used the word Carnatic, sometimes Karnatak, to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna.|$|E

30|$|Fly ash {{utilization}} {{with several}} <b>soils</b> (likely <b>black</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>soils)</b> has {{its effect on}} index properties of soils as investigated by Sivapullaiah et al. [27]. The coarseness of fly ash particle decreases the activity number and plasticity index of <b>black</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>soils.</b> Volume change behavior of fly ash stabilized clays studied by Phanikumar and Sharma [24] revealed effective results of swell potential and consolidation. Stabilization of expansive soils with fly ash resulted in decrease of swell potential, swelling pressure, plasticity index, activity, free swell and axial shrinkage percent {{with an increase in}} fly ash content [30]. Several field investigations revealed properties of dumped waste stabilization using cementitious materials and fly ash. Laboratory tests such as California bearing ratio (CBR) and direct shear test performed on dumped waste with addition of varying percentages of fly ash revealed that with addition of 20 % fly ash, the shear strength parameters of dumped waste have increased considerably. Bottom ash has been used as light fill material in soft ground, due to its lower bulk density and excellent drainage capacity [26]. Many researchers have conducted experimental studies to determine the suitability of bottom ash to be used in backfilling material in highway embankment [4]. Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate the suitability of bottom ash as filler material in the asphalt pavement. These studies indicate that, replacement of bottom ash in asphalt mixture improve the structural stability, skid resistance and resilient modulus [3]. Past studies show that, municipal solid waste incinerator ash can be utilized in geotechnical applications such as embankments, landfills and aggregate in road construction [6].|$|R
5000|$|The {{irrigation}} {{component of}} the project was planned to provide an annual cropping intensity of 200 percent to irrigate semi-dry crops in nearly 60 percent of the command area dominated by red loamy soils. Irrigated area spreads over Davanagere, Shivamogga, Chikmagalur and Bellary districts comprising predominantly red loamy soils except in some portions of the right bank canal area which consist of <b>Black</b> <b>Cotton</b> <b>soils.</b> However, the actual cropping was predominately rice and also sugarcane and permanent gardens; 90% area on the left bank canal system and 60% area of the right bank canal system was dominated by rice. This practice resulted in heavy demand on water causing serious concerns on the irrigation system itself. Consequently, National Water Management Project (NWMP) was launched with the objective to [...] "rehabilitate and provide more equitable, predictable and reliable irrigation service which could improve agricultural productivity and farm income". This project has resulted in substantial improvements in both the area brought under irrigation and consequent agricultural crop production.|$|R
