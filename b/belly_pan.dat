25|$|To {{commemorate the}} 60th {{anniversary of the}} U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, Ford {{released}} a single, special edition 2014 Ford Mustang GT coupe, VIN number 0001. It is equipped with white body colour with red and blue accents, USAF markings and logos, wide body modifications, a handcrafted and painted <b>belly</b> <b>pan</b> by Creations n' Chrome that emulated the F-16 Thunderbird appearance, front and rear wide body elements by TS Designs, custom 22-inch wheels by Forgiato, a modified navigation screen, instrument cluster, removal of and rear seat, Recaro seats with embroidered Thunderbirds elements, unique sill plates and puddle lamps, a Ford Racing supercharger, suspension handling pack, Brembo brakes.|$|E
50|$|Quarter {{and half}} {{fairings}} are often {{paired with a}} <b>belly</b> <b>pan</b> below the engine for diverting air flow away from under the engine to reduce aerodynamic lift, as well as cosmetic reasons. Some track day or racing rules require belly pans to catch leaked fluids.|$|E
50|$|The 1986 model {{received}} a 25 mm longer swing arm {{to improve the}} handling. Apart from a modified <b>belly</b> <b>pan</b> and upgraded headlamps {{there is very little}} difference between the 1985 and 1986 models. 1986 is the first year the model was introduced to the US.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Bray Hill at dusk. The racing line {{is tight}} into the kerb, hence the {{scraping}} {{of the road}} surface created by the motorcycles' fairing <b>belly</b> <b>pans</b> as their suspension compresses.|$|R
50|$|While the {{standard}} S-10 {{moved to a}} redesigned front fascia in 1998, the S-10 Electric kept the same front fascia as the '94-'97, {{with the exception of}} composite headlamps in 1998 versus the previous year's sealed-beam headlamps. The interior was also updated in 1998 along with internal combustion models, adding a passenger side airbag. Aside from this header panel, a unique lower bumper valance, and a stylized 'Electric' decal {{on the bottom of the}} doors, there is little difference externally between the appearance of an Electric and a stock S-10. Any changes, however minimal, were reported to have had a positive influence on reducing the truck's aerodynamic resistance. These changes included a closed grille and a front air skirt, <b>belly</b> <b>pans</b> beneath the front suspension, a seal between the cab and the pickup bed, and a half-length tonneau cover over the rear of the pickup bed.|$|R
40|$|Most modern {{vehicles}} have {{protective covers}} such as skid plates and <b>belly</b> <b>pans</b> {{that cover the}} majority of the undercarriage. Therefore, specific jack points exist on each corner of these vehicles. A jack can be placed on these points to safely lift the vehicle up without damaging any plastic covers. However, this poses a problem for the DIY mechanic. The jack point usually does not leave enough room for a jack and a jack stand. The objective of the Automotive Hub Stand Design project was to design an affordable alternative to the traditional jack stand that can be mounted directly to the hub of the vehicle using the factory lug pattern and nuts. The goal was to create a universal system that could be used on any vehicle. This was accomplished by utilizing an interchangeable Hub Plate Member that can be manufactured for specific vehicles. For the scope of this project, one hub plate member that incorporates both Subaru and Audi vehicles was manufactured. Column buckling and shear force calculations as well as material strength analysis was completed for this project. The Automotive Hub Stand was modeled using Solidworks and manufactured out of 6061 Aluminum. All of the parts were completed with the resources available at CWU’s machine and welding shops. The Hub Stand was designed to hold up 1. 5 tons and cost under $ 300. The project was a success in regards to the set requirements in cost, usability (ease of use), dimensions and load/capacity requirements...|$|R
5000|$|... 2004 (K4) Redesigned {{instrument}} cluster. Upgrade 16-bit to 32-bit ECU, some sensors changed. New turn signals, 20 watt without reflector {{compared with}} earlier 10 watt. <b>Belly</b> <b>pan</b> redesigned. Stronger hand guards attached to end of handlebar. New adjustable windscreen design. Left handlebar switch incorporates flash-to-pass & emergency blinkers (EU models already had this). Stronger handlebars. Revised mirrors for less mirror breakage.|$|E
50|$|A {{revised version}} was {{launched}} in 1984 and displaced 891 cc. Aside from the engine capacity increase it was equipped with more conventional forks than its predecessor and a <b>belly</b> <b>pan</b> came as standard. The increase in engine capacity meant the carburettors went up from 35 mm to 36 mm. Fuel capacity is 22 litres and the transmission is a 5 speed with {{a top speed of}} around 200 km/h. Aside from these changes it was nearly identical to the original and was manufactured until 1994.|$|E
50|$|The {{front brake}} {{was a single}} inboard {{ventilated}} disc that was developed to improve brake performance and feel. This was only seen on Honda models for a few years, before a switch to sintered metal brake pads with the more traditional disc/caliper arrangement. Other features included a hydraulic clutch, Comstar wheels with tubeless tyres, TRAC anti-dive front forks and Pro-Link rear suspension. Engine coolant passed {{through one of the}} frame tubes. The early UK specification model had built-in front fairing indicators, and optional radiator side-cowls and <b>belly</b> <b>pan.</b> Following the VT250F, the VT250 Spada and VTR250 were produced.|$|E

5000|$|BYD’s [...] "Fe" [...] lithium iron {{phosphate}} battery, which powers the e6, {{represents one}} of the company’s core technologies. All chemical substances used in the battery can be recycled.There are four different power combinations for the e6: 101 hp (75 kW), 101+54 hp (75+40 kW), 215 hp (160 kW) and 215+54 hp (160+40 kW).Most of (or at least part of) the e6 battery pack is located on the <b>belly</b> <b>pan</b> of the vehicle.The two-motor options use front and rear motors, making the car all-wheel drive.According to the manufacturer the lithium iron phosphate battery of the car is charged at a fast charging station within 15 minutes to 80%, after 40 minutes at 100%.|$|E

A full fairing VT250F2 was also produced to help the rider from being fatigue at high speeds it also featured double row cam chains. Later models also came with an aluminium box frame. The engine redlined at 13500 rpm. The engine also tends to heat up causing severe damage to the crankshaft bearings. It is advised to use only 10W/40 engine oil for v-twins and v-four engine motorcycles.|$|E
5000|$|Bizzarrini {{focused his}} design {{effort on the}} car's {{aerodynamics}} {{in an attempt to}} improve top speed and stability. The body design was informed by wind tunnel testing at Pisa University as well as road and track testing with several prototypes. The resulting all-aluminium bodywork had a long, low nose, small radiator inlet, and distinctive air intakes on the nose with removable covers. Early testing resulted in the addition of a rear spoiler. The underside of the car was covered by a <b>belly</b> <b>pan</b> and had an additional spoiler underneath formed by the fuel tank cover. The aerodynamic design of the 250 GTO was a major technical innovation compared to previous Ferrari GT cars, and in line with contemporary developments by manufacturers such as Lotus. The bodies were constructed by Scaglietti, with the exception of early prototypes with bodies constructed in-house by Ferrari or by Pininfarina (in the case of s/n 2643 GT). Cars were produced in many colours, with the most famous being the bright red [...] "Rosso Cina".|$|E
5000|$|Speed {{is divided}} up into {{different}} engine capacity classes and a Jet class (using pulse jet engines). As the name suggests, {{the idea is}} to have the model go as fast as possible. The model is timed over a number of laps, and the pilot must hold the handle controlling his model in a yoke on top of a pole {{in the middle of the}} circle. This is in order to stop the pilot from assisting the model to go faster by increasing the line tension and leading the model (known as whipping). Monoline control systems are common in the US, but international classes require the use of two-line control. Speeds of the fastest models - Class D [...] and Jet - have in the past exceeded 220 mi/h km/h. Current US rules limit the speeds to <200 mi/h km/h by requiring the use of larger lines if 200 mi/h km/h is exceeded. Speed models are usually launched from a [...] "dolly" [...] - a cart that permits a lengthy ground roll for takeoff, but drops away in the air to reduce drag. The airplane lands on a skid or <b>belly</b> <b>pan.</b>|$|E
50|$|Besides heat {{impact on}} the driver, the engine was also prone to {{overheating}}, due {{in no small part}} to the failure to account for vents to draw hot air out of the engine compartment. Eventually, the overheating problems were solved by using a larger Pontiac NASCAR radiator, by cutting various configurations of holes in the hood and full-length <b>belly</b> <b>pan</b> and lastly by adding spoilers to draw the hot air out from underneath the hood (the first hood spoiler was actually a rope that ran across the hood from fender to fender.) Another major problem was due to the aforementioned mid-stream change in purpose for the vehicle; because the car was originally designed as a proof-of-concept, the chassis lacked the rigidity necessary for road racing (little triangulation was incorporated into the original design). Under changing loads such as those experienced on a twisting road course, the vehicle's suspension geometry continually changed and proved difficult to handle, even for experienced drivers such as Jerry Titus. Adding power only aggravated the problem; under hard acceleration, the trailing arms could bow outwards, allowing the rear wheels to toe in. Owners of the car were able to improve handling by adding gussets and triangulation to the chassis, modified (or completely re-engineered) trailing arms and disc brakes.|$|E
40|$|The {{selection}} of Gale crater as the Mars Science Laboratory landing site took over five years, involved broad {{participation of the}} science community via five open workshops, and narrowed an initial > 50 sites (25 by 20 km) to four finalists (Eberswalde, Gale, Holden and Mawrth) based on science and safety. Engineering constraints important to the selection included: (1) latitude (± 30 °) for thermal management of the rover and instruments, (2) elevation (< − 1 km) for sufficient atmosphere to slow the spacecraft, (3) relief of < 100 – 130 m at baselines of 1 – 1000 m for control authority and sufficient fuel during powered descent, (4) slopes of < 30 ° at baselines of 2 – 5 m for rover stability at touchdown, (5) moderate rock abundance to avoid impacting the <b>belly</b> <b>pan</b> during touchdown, and (6) a radar-reflective, load-bearing, and trafficable surface that is safe for landing and roving and not dominated by fine-grained dust. Science criteria important for the selection include the ability to assess past habitable environments, which include diversity, context, and biosignature (including organics) preservation. Sites were evaluated in detail using targeted data from instruments on all active orbiters, and especially Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. All of the final four sites have layered sedimentary rocks with spectral evidence for phyllosilicates that clearly address the science objectives of the mission. Sophisticated entry, descent and landing simulations that include detailed information {{on all of the}} engineering constraints indicate all of the final four sites are safe for landing. Evaluation of the traversabilty of the landing sites and target “go to” areas outside of the ellipse using slope and material properties information indicates that all are trafficable and “go to” sites can be accessed within the lifetime of the mission. In the final selection, Gale crater was favored over Eberswalde based on its greater diversity and potential habitability...|$|E
