2500|$|From 1940, {{she lived}} in {{perpetual}} anxiety and was not able shake off {{the thought that the}} Regency was only a moribund and transitory situation, and so she feared to think how it might end. In private company, she often said: [...] "we came to power in a decent way, through the door, but I fear that we will only get out of here through the window". Her concern did not materialize word for word, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> that the remaining members of the Horthy family left the Castle of Buda on 17 October 1944 under dire circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|Lecturing to new missionaries on how {{to adapt}} to Chinese culture led Rawlinson to read the Chinese classics. In {{addition}} to Confucius and Mozi he read modern Chinese scholars such as Liang Qichao and Hu Shi. Physically and spiritually happy in his new marriage, he began to develop a more favorable understanding of Chinese religions, especially Buddhism. Although he was often away from home, Frank and Florence conducted extensive discussions on family, their relationship, and theology by letters. In one letter he compared her to [...] "the smile of God," [...] but explained that he found his faith moving away from its evangelical foundations. He described his Call as [...] "a vision of human need that has never left me..., (<b>but)</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> that I have changed my ideas {{on how to}} meet it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Wubi {{method is}} based on the {{structure}} of characters rather than their pronunciation, making it possible to input characters even when the user does not know the pronunciation, as well as not being too closely linked to any particular spoken variety of Chinese. It is also extremely efficient: every character can be written with at most 4 keystrokes. [...] In practice, most characters can be written with fewer. There are reports of experienced typists reaching 160 characters per minute with Wubi. What this means in the context of Chinese is not entirely the same as it is for English, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> that Wubi is extremely fast when used by an experienced typist. The main reason for this is that, unlike with traditional phonetic input methods, one does not have to spend time selecting the desired character from a list of homophonic possibilities: virtually all characters have a unique representation.|$|E
6000|$|Dick hesitated. Clare {{had stolen}} his papers. This seemed impossible, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b> Yet {{when he looked}} up he {{answered}} as his heart urged him: ...|$|R
6000|$|Only--he didn't. On the {{contrary}} his Majesty actually smiled {{so far as}} a Dog can smile--and (the other Dogs couldn't believe their eyes, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> all the same) his Majesty wagged his tail! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Delahaye," [...] I said, [...] "my {{story may}} have sounded strangely, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b> I presume {{that you did}} not come here solely with the purpose of expressing your amiable opinion of my veracity?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The liberal {{retreat into}} the immanent plenum of sensory {{experience}} (with its related Christology of Christ as purely an outstanding [...] "servant of God"), was as unacceptable as Bultmann's accidental denigration of transcendent Truth into something purely mythical (totally ahistorical). [...] Theologie der Auferstehung was his manifesto on the subject, and he updated it many years later, with {{a chapter on}} eschatology and the aeon of aeons, {{as well as more}} arguments aimed at Bultmann. He also included a new, need discussion on the nature of Time (something Augustine had noted as problematic long ago), in which (predictably) he rejected the dichotomy between eternity and earthly time: [...] "This positing of an exclusive antithesis between time and eternity makes impossible any union of the eternal God with temporal man" [...] (p.182). Theologie der Auferstehung is tightly argued, copiously footnoted, and conceived with vision : {{it is no accident that}} he shares an affinity with Eastern theology on this point (regardless of their emphasis on the Incarnation), noting that the Evangelical Churches in Russia have [...] "a profound grasp of the Easter Act of Jesus Christ" [...] (p.19). Moltmann may have emphasized the cross, and the Catholic Church the Incarnation, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> to assert that for Künneth, the Resurrection is the Archimedean point of eschatology, the meaning of time, history, miracles, dogma, and all else beside. Anything else, he believes, undercuts the early Christian emphasis on Jesus as the risen Kyrios (Lord), who is [...] "risen indeed!". This reprinted [...] "monograph" [...] on the Resurrection was also a reaction to Paul Althaus' doctrines, which he partly agreed with, but who had criticized the original edition, and to whom Künneth respectfully responded.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} impossible, doctor; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> I {{have seen her}} myself," [...] and he shuddered. [...] "She has been stabbed to the heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is unfortunate," [...] he murmured, [...] "since {{you have}} been so gallant as to follow her, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true!</b> You will {{understand}} this perfectly--to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|He might deny <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b> Ah, Tommy, you bore {{with her}} with {{infinite}} patience, <b>but</b> did <b>it</b> never strike {{you that she}} kept you to the earth? If Elspeth could be happy without you! You were sure she could not, but if she could!--had that thought never made you flap your wings? ...|$|R
60|$|Who {{could have}} made them? That is what Lightfoot wanted to know and what he meant to find out. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> clear to him {{that there was a}} {{stranger}} in the Green Forest, and somehow he didn't resent it in the least. In fact, he was glad. He couldn't have told why, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b>|$|R
50|$|We couldnt believe <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b> We filed past a {{cylindrical}} metal container, {{and each}} of us received a hot, delicious pork chop. The chow had been sent ashore for Company K by the crew of LST-661. I vowed if the chance ever came I would express my thanks to those sailors for that chow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it sounds}} like it, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> enough," [...] and Ralph repeated, word for word, the {{proclamation}} which he had translated to Major Tempe.|$|E
60|$|And so ends my snake-story, {{which is}} perhaps not very interesting; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> and {{therefore}} has one advantage over all other snake-stories told by travellers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then go I and wash, Flathead; <b>but,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> in {{the great}} heats I have wished I could slough my skin without pain, and run skinless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes! I {{remember}} the shock with which I heard like a doom {{that he was}} going the way of the others; and hen he and the dear Claude came out in his yacht to us at Gibraltar, and were so bright! We had a wonderful little journey into Spain together, and how Jasper enjoyed it! Little did I think I was never to see Claude here again. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> not, that all Rotherwood's care gave the dear fellow much more comfort--perhaps kept him longer?' ...|$|R
50|$|Entering a law practice, {{he wrote}} poetry {{in his spare}} time <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> his <b>true</b> vocation.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> very lame, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> piteous; yet Langbourne {{could not}} relent. His {{grievance}} {{was not with}} what she had done, but what she was; not what she really was, but what she materially was; her looks, her figure, her stature, her whole presence, so different from that {{which he had been}} carrying in his mind, and adoring for a year past.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You may {{not know}} it, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> Nobody who has not seen the Yara laughs like that.' And Julia flung herself on the ground weeping bitterly.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is queer, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> {{just the}} same, whether {{you believe it}} or not," [...] {{retorted}} Jenny Wren, and whisked out of sight into her home.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> sister: I do {{not feel}} {{it on my own}} account so much as----However," [...] he added, [...] "it will all be the same in heaven." ...|$|E
60|$|Thinking the {{thoughts}} of a lunatic or a dope-fiend, I fell asleep; and when I awoke, my hands and feet were securely tied and my weapons {{had been taken from}} me. How they did it without awakening me I cannot tell you. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> humiliating, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b> To-jo stood above me. The early light of morning was dimly filtering into the cave.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> brutally put; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> true--doubly <b>true,</b> {{after the}} opening of Miss Gwilt's letter. Mrs. Milroy gave way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Granted; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> must <b>be</b> <b>true</b> {{sentiment}}, not false," [...] Heneage said. [...] "This sentiment which {{interferes with}} justice is false sentiment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know," [...] said Lady Harman, in a halty undertone, [...] "you--you are {{too hard}} upon--upon clever people, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> I {{mean it is}} true in a way...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not know}} that I shewed it; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> I feel as if Marian Lind was a person whom I knew once, but whom I should hardly know again." ...|$|E
60|$|General Burnside {{has been}} {{frequently}} informed lately that the division under General Getty cannot be spared. I {{am sorry to}} have to tell you this, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> and cannot be helped.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} afternoon Beatrice rode moodily {{across the}} plain. After another {{talk with her}} mother, she had passed a sleepless night and spent the morning wandering restlessly to and fro. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> horribly degrading to her to feel that Brand had bought her; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> and <b>it</b> destroyed the hope that time might reconcile her to her lot. She could not forgive him that, <b>but</b> after all <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only part of an intolerable situation.|$|R
60|$|Beatrice {{turned and}} flashed such a look {{on him that}} he fell back and left her. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> {{and she knew that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b> If Geoffrey had given her a sixpence with a hole in it, she would have valued it more than all the {{diamonds}} on earth. Oh! what a position <b>was</b> hers. And <b>it</b> <b>was</b> wrong, too. She had no right to love the husband of another woman. But right or wrong the fact remained: she did love him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never quite}} {{know when you}} are in earnest, Cuthbert; <b>but</b> if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> very good news. Do you mean that you are really studying?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> How the old wonder-workers guessed at almighty Truth!" [...] Then a hot blush {{swept her}} face, {{and her eyes}} fell. Her father smiled at her lovingly as he resumed: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course! You may {{not believe}} it, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> that I am {{the person who}} has saved your country! And I am quits at last with Herbert de la Meux, Duc de Souspennier!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is not {{thinking}} of her king but of her lover's life," [...] said Bakenkhonsu. [...] "She is not a witch as they declare, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> that she knows what we do not." ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{meaning that}} {{whatever}} of aggregate output (...) is neither {{consumed by the}} private (...) nor the government (...) must be what <b>is</b> invested (...) [...] <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also <b>true</b> that ...|$|R
50|$|There is {{no single}} {{conclusion}} {{to the question of}} who invented the cuckoo clock, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> probably <b>true</b> that Ketterer <b>was</b> a major player in their development.|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> and {{the news}} had already {{penetrated}} to the outer office; for while he sat with a heavy heart, pondering on these things, and resting his head upon his arm, Perch the messenger, descending from his mahogany bracket, and jogging his elbow, begged his pardon, but wished to say in his ear, Did he think he could arrange to send home to England a jar of preserved Ginger, cheap, for Mrs Perch's own eating, {{in the course of}} her recovery from her next confinement? ...|$|R
