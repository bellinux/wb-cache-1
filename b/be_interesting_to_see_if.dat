5000|$|While at the Academy, Eisenhower played American {{football}} for West Point. This {{would not be}} an issue except that in order to play college football, one must have never played a sport for money, because doing so causes forfeiture of an athlete's amateur status. If Eisenhower did in fact play baseball for money, it would have been in violation of the Cadet Honor Code. One source contends that Eisenhower even signed a voucher claiming that he had never played sports for money. [...] The Eisenhower Presidential Library claimed in an e-mail that [...] "We do not have any documentation as to whether Ike signed a voucher when he arrived at West Point.

Speaking to Inside Soap magazine about the storyline, Danson explained: [...] "Leanne {{has never really}} given her birth mother a second thought because she's not been in her life. Her dad Les and stepmum Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle) were together for a long time, so Janice always took on that mother role. Having said that, Leanne's always known Janice by her first name, so she hasn't called anyone 'Mummy'." [...] Discussing having Collins as her on-screen mother, Danson {{said that she was}} looking forward to the [...] "really meaty" [...] scenes between Stella and Leanne. Danson added that people have said that she and Collins have similar face shapes and the same mannerisms. She thought it would <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> viewers pick up on the resemblance between herself and Collins.|$|E

At CCM Magazine, Matt Conner felt that [...] "With spirited melodies and undeniable energy, Shine Bright Baby {{has no problem}} living up to their brand name." [...] Marcus Hathcock of New Release Tuesday affirmed that [...] "Dreamers has both the musical chops and the encouraging message {{to be one of}} the summer's best albums, if not one of the year's best." [...] At Jesus Freak Hideout, Roger Gelwicks evoked that [...] "As talented and good-intentioned as Dreamers is, the band massively undersells themselves with their flickering musical identity still in its foundational stages." [...] In addition, Michael Weaver of Jesus Freak Hideout noted that [...] "Sadly, it feels as though another rock band has had their edges polished off, but don't count these Ohio natives out just yet. It will <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> Shine Bright Baby heads back to their rock roots, or further into their pop present." ...|$|E

[...] Techdirt says that this Federal Circuit ruling [...] "may now be the nail in the coffin on software patents in the US." [...] It sees Judge Mayer as declaring that [...] "it's time to face facts: Alice killed software patents." [...] Techdirt concludes by asking what the next step in this case will be: [...] "It will <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> Intellectual Ventures tries to kick this up a level to the Supreme Court, where it might risk SCOTUS actually agreeing with Judge Mayer." ...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the more}} {{interesting}} findings with regards to what was found is that which deals with the farming aspect of this culture. This village, and others like it, replaced Roman farms after the imperial administration left Britain. The Anglo-Saxons settled in small villages that were generally self-sustaining. Within these self-sustaining communities there is evidence that these peoples were more likely to provide for themselves through a farming lifestyle than a foraging one. Within the archaeological remains there were more domesticated animal species found than wild animal species, which also suggests that this group were less dependent on hunting as a means of survival, and supports the idea that they were farmers.The settlers in this area were thought to be from a different area, with German descent being the most likely area, and as such it is interesting to see what farming techniques may be employed by this group. Since the landscapes are quite different, it would <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> the newly settled group would use a German style of farming in this new terrain. This area helps to provide some insight into these farming adaptations. Within animal husbandry, however, this group was more likely to use elements found within the native system of the country.|$|E

Speaking of the {{development}} in the storyline, Coulson commented: [...] "It's a journey Carol goes on and she makes some terrible decisions." [...] Coulson later revealed she wanted Carol to have more friends. Carol is then paired with Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) as they strike an [...] "unlikely friendship" [...] and move in together, after she feels unable to live at the home her son died in. Coulson felt that Carol was reinventing herself, she also stated: [...] "It's a strange pairing, but it'll <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> they can find common ground." [...] Barber also admitted she is a fan of the pairing, expressed her desire for Glenda to lead Carol astray and stated: [...] "The characters are very different but actually have a lot in common." [...] Coulson has also admitted she felt it important viewers could see how strong Carol can be, she added: [...] "I'd like to show viewers that Carol is strong enough to transcend all of this, because people have to - but it won't just go away." ...|$|E

Taken as a group, these locations are associated with visual and attention processes that are related to visual-spatial simultaneous processing working memory.

30|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for the occurrence of VBNC cells after desiccation is that these cells are without functional template for replication of DNA. DNA is a major target of desiccation in microorganisms, including E.coli (Asada et al. 1979) and D. radiodurans (Mattimore and Battista 1996), as degradation of DNA is common as a response to desiccation. In rhizobia, desiccation sensitive mutants were isolated with mutations in the DNA repair systems (Humann et al. 2009), confirming that rhizobia are similarly affected by desiccation. It would <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> the CFU of rhizobia increases after desiccation with in-trans expression of DNA repair enzymes.|$|E
