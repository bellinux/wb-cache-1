40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in order to predict the <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> (response variable) during CNC plasma-arc cutting of St 37 mild steel plates. The four (4) input parameters (plate thickness, cutting speed, arc ampere, and torch standoff distance) of the ANN was selected following the results (relative importance) of the Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) performed based on seven (7) factors (plate thickness, cutting speed, arc ampere, arc voltage, air pressure, pierce height, and torch standoff distance) in a previous study. A multi-parameter optimization was carried out using the robust design. An L 18 (21 × 37) Taguchi orthogonal array experiment was conducted and the right <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> was measured, aiming at the investigation of the influence of plasma-arc cut process parameters on right side <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> of St 37 mild steel cut surface.

40|$|Background and Aim: Achieving {{appropriate}} seal in canal obturation is {{the main}} goal of endodontic therapy. However, in some cases, {{it can not be}} obtained by non-surgical procedures alone. Retrograde surgery {{is one of the most}} common procedures in endodontics. Apical seal improvement can be obtained by root end filling and decreasing the root end resection <b>angle</b> (<b>bevel</b> <b>angle).</b> The aim of this study was to investigate the role of <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> on apical microleakage following the use of amalgam and MTA as root end filling materials. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 128 extracted human teeth were instrumented and obturated by lateral condensation technique. The teeth were divided into two groups and the apical root resection was performed by high speed fissure bur (one group perpendicular to the long axis of the teeth and the other 45 &# 61616; to the long axis. The 3 mm root end cavity was prepared by ultrasonic device. Each group was divided into two subgroups: One filled with amalgam and the other with MTA. Teeth were incubated for 72 h, covered by two layers of nail polish (except for apical 3 mm) and submerged in methylene blue for 48 h. Teeth were washed under tap water and mesiodistally dissected by low speed disc. Dye penetration was evaluated by stereomicroscope. Data were analysed by two way ANOVA and Tukey tests with p< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: The results showed that retrofill material type had a significant effect on microleakage and MTA was superior to amalgam in this respect. <b>Bevel</b> <b>angle</b> failed to show any significant effect on apical microleakage. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, it seems that the use of MTA instead of amalgam in clinical practice can improve the success rate of endodontic surgery whereas the <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> can be determined based on the status of each individual case; However, increasing the <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> seems to increase microleakage due to exposure of more dentinal tubules...|$|R

A model of needle-tissue interaction that predicts the needle tip location would assist physicians in pre-operative planning and hence improve needle targeting accuracy.

An experimental setup is designed to record the needle-gel interaction forces and torques during needle insertion. Gel rupture during needle insertion is observed using a Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope and recorded in time series and three-dimensional images (Figure).

In the case of moisture content four membership functions, namely, suitable (0 - 20 %), semi suitable (10 - 30 %), high (20 - 40 %), and very high (35 - 50 %) and for the blade <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> three membership functions, including very low (0 - 10 º), low (10 - 20 º) and common (15 - 30 º) were assigned.

40|$|Accurate needle {{placement}} {{is important}} during percutaneous needle insertion procedures such as biopsy and brachytherapy.

In this paper, we have investigated the effects of insertion velocity, tip <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> and insertion proﬁle on needle deﬂection in three-dimensional space (in-plane and out-of-plane). Experiments are done using soft-tissue simulant and chicken liver. The needle tip is tracked during insertion using stereoscopic cameras and an electromagnetic tracker. Experimental {{results show that the}} in-plane and out-of-plane deﬂection decreases, as insertion velocity increases. Varying the <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> from 30 ° to 60 ° is shown to decrease the in-plane deﬂection, and increase the out-of-plane deﬂection. The addition of rotational motion during continuous linear insertion decreases both the in-plane and out-of-plane deﬂection. Tapping during insertion does not produce signiﬁcant reduction in the in-plane or out-of-plane deﬂection. An increase in the insertion velocity from 10 mm/s to 300 mm/s during insertion into chicken liver results in the decrease and increase in the in-plane and out-of plane deﬂection, respectively. A monotonic increase in the out-of-plane deﬂection as insertion velocity increases is probably caused by the needle slipping while penetrating the outer capsule of the liver.
