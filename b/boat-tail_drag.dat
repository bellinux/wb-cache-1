40|$|The {{afterbody}} drag {{which consists}} of the <b>boat-tail</b> <b>drag</b> and the base drag can be {{a significant portion of}} the overall drag of an aerospace vehicle. There is a sufficiently strong need for a facility which can be used for estimating the drag of several afterbody variations of a proposed configuration with a view to minimise the overall drag. In view of this a project to design, build and test a special purpose facility for base flow/afterbody investigations in NAL was approved by ARDB. Considerable progress have been made since the inception of the project. The progress of the project during 1936 - 87 and the future programme of work are presented in this report. Since some major components are under fabrication at the works of the contractor, it is expected that facility could be completed in 1988 - 89...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{performed}} on several boat-tailed afterbodies and sting combinations {{with a view to}} assessing sting corrections on afterbody drag at transonic speeds, Measurements made included afterbody total drag and base pressure in the Mach number range of 0. 6 - 1. 0 and at relatively high Reynolds number, Correlations of base pressure and <b>boat-tail</b> pressure <b>drag</b> for the sting diameter and flare effects have been proposed using dimensional arguments.

Measurements made included afterbody total drag and base pressure in the Mach number range of 0. 6 - 1. 0 and Reynolds number range of 8 - 9. 5 x 106.

40|$|Results of zero-lift drag {{characteristics}} of afterbodies with a square base relevant to missile and projectile applications at several transonic Mach numbers and Mach 2 are presented. These afterbodies, at zero incidence, generate vortical flows upstream {{of the base}} like that on the lee side of a delta wing at incidence. The measurements made consisted primarily of afterbody drag using a balance and base pressure and extensive surface flow visualization {{studies were carried out}} to infer features associated with vortex flows. Results of base pressure, <b>boat-tail</b> profile <b>drag,</b> and total afterbody drag are presented and compared with results from the axisymmetric counterpart involving circular arc and conical boat tailing having the same base area. Some aspects of the flow features on square-base afterbodies are discussed as well...|$|R
