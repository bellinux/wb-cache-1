5|$|At least 30% of TBI are not {{discovered}} at first; this number may <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 50%. In about 10% of cases, TBI has no specific signs either clinically or on chest radiography, and its detection may be {{further complicated by}} concurrent injuries, since TBI tends to occur after high-energy accidents.

Included in his total were 23 Messerschmitt Bf 109s, four Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and one Messerschmitt Bf 110. Official records differ over the exact total. After the war, two of Finucane's victories that were credited as probables had, in fact, been destroyed, but were not officially included.

5|$|Efforts to {{calculate}} the true economic value of unpaid work, which {{is not included in}} measures such as gross domestic product, have shown that this value is enormous. In the United States, it has been estimated to be between 20–50%, meaning that the true value of unpaid work is trillions of dollars per year. For other countries, the percentage of GDP may be even higher, such as the United Kingdom, where is may <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 70%. Because this unpaid work is largely done by women and is unreported in economic indicators, it results in these contributions by women being devalued in a society.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the {{remnant of the}} donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed {{when it was a}} member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 100–200km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E

5|$|Herdwicks are a dual-purpose breed, {{producing}} strongly flavoured {{lamb and}} mutton and a coarse, grey wool. This slowly maturing breed {{is one of}} the most hardy of all the British hill sheep breeds, withstanding the cold and relentless rain of the Lake District at heights upwards of 3,000 feet (about 1,000 metres). Most Herdwicks spend winter on the fells, from approximately December to April. They are normally left to graze freely on the hillsides (without any additional feed), but each ewe tends to stay in her heaf (the local term for heft), the same small area of fell. Due to the rough conditions on fells, lambing losses can <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 25%. This ability to thrive unassisted is part of the reason fell farmers so highly value Herdwicks over much higher-producing lowland breeds.|$|E
5|$|Inexplicably, Generals Floyd and Pillow were upbeat {{about the}} day's {{performance}} and wired General Johnston at Nashville {{that they had}} won a great victory. Buckner, however, argued {{that they were in}} a desperate position that was getting worse with the arrival of Union reinforcements. At their final council of war in the Dover Hotel at 1:30a.m. on February 16, Buckner stated that if C.F. Smith attacked again, he could only hold for thirty minutes, and he estimated that the cost of defending the fort would <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> a seventy-five percent casualty rate. Buckner's position finally carried the meeting. Any large-scale escape would be difficult. Most of the river transports were currently transporting wounded men to Nashville and would not return in time to evacuate the command.|$|E
5|$|Naked {{extracellular}} DNA (eDNA), {{most of it}} {{released by}} cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 2 μg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 μg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it {{may be involved in}} horizontal gene transfer; it may provide nutrients; and it may act as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics. Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; it may contribute to biofilm formation; and it may contribute to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.|$|E
