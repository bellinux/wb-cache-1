5|$|Trent Milton {{was born}} in Newcastle, New South Wales, on 4 May 1972. He {{currently}} lives in Lake Cathie, New South Wales. On 5 March 2011, a motorcycle accident {{on the way home}} from work in Port Macquarie tore off his right leg. It also led to a brain injury. Doctors considered amputating both his arms – his right arm hung <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thread</b> – but managed to save both, which they fastened back together with steel plates. He suffered post-traumatic amnesia, and spent a year in recovery.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Martill {{suggested}} that the odontoid {{at the tip of}} the lower jaw of Istiodactylus served to fill the space where no tooth was present. This completed an arc-like bite that would have been necessary to sever morsels that would otherwise remain attached <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thread.</b> Martill stated that few other animals are known with teeth similar to those of Istiodactylus, but pointed out the similarity to various types of sharks and reptiles, including the cookiecutter shark, which takes circular bites from fish as well as prey much larger than itself (including whales). Istiodactylus may also have taken circular bites from prey larger than itself (such as dinosaurs and crocodiles), but perhaps also from fish, for example by snapping at their backs near the water surface. Martill stated that there were many differences between the skull of Istiodactylus and extant scavengers, such as the lack of a sharp, pointed beak, which could have made it less capable of tearing flesh, but the long neck may have provided enough pulling power, and the claws on the fingers may have been used to manipulate carcasses. Martill agreed that Istiodactylus was most likely a scavenger that would have used its robust teeth to scrape meat from bones, as indicated by wear-facets on the tooth-tips (he proposed that scratch-marks should be looked for on dinosaur bones). He also {{suggested that}} if they were scraping away the last flesh from a carcass, like marabou storks, they would have been in the back of the queue for access to it.|$|E

25|$|Another alternative, {{suitable}} for solid wall enclosures, is to {{attach to the}} wall a horizontal piece of screen that projects inward several inches over the enclosure. The screen is made with material such as nylon monofilament that is moderately stiff and springy yet easily flexible. On the inside edge of the screen, the cross fibers are removed, producing a fringe several inches wide. When a snail crawls {{on the underside of}} the screen and moves out onto the fringe, his weight pulls several individual fibers down. One by one, another fiber gets away from the snail and springs back up out of reach. Eventually the snail is dangling <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thread.</b> The snail then falls, because the surface area is not big enough to crawl on.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the ancient}} {{religions}} {{of the world have}} a tradition of using some type of prayer beads as tools in devotional meditation. Most prayer beads and Christian rosaries consist of pearls or beads linked together <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thread.</b> The Roman Catholic rosary is a string of beads containing five sets with ten small beads. Each set of ten is separated by another bead. The Hindu japa mala has 108 beads (the figure 108 in itself having spiritual significance, as well as those used in Jainism and Buddhist prayer beads. Each bead is counted once as a person recites a mantra until the person has gone {{all the way around the}} mala. The Muslim misbaha has 99 beads.

25|$|The Dodgers next began a key {{road trip}} against {{the two teams}} with the best records in the National League, the Washington Nationals and Cincinnati Reds. The opener of their series against the Nationals was rained out, forcing them to play a double-header on September 19. In the first game, the bats {{continued}} to be non-existent as they lost 3-1. In the second game, Josh Beckett was brilliant for 7 innings as they Dodgers built a 6-0 lead, only to see the bullpen falter in the 8th and the Nationals tied the game. Matt Kemp homered {{in the top of}} the ninth to provide the crucial run in the 7-6 victory. They closed out the series the next day with a 4-1 loss, dimming their post-season hopes. The Dodgers beat the Reds on September 21, thanks to a 2 RBI single by Kemp {{in the top of the}} 10th inning. Mat Latos shut down the Dodgers the next day, for a 6-0 Reds victory. Clayton Kershaw made the start on September 23, his first start since in 12 days since suffering a hip injury. Kershaw allowed only one run in 5 innings and Adrian Gonzalez hit two home runs, to lead the Dodgers to a 5-3 victory over the Reds. The Dodgers, with their season hanging <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thread,</b> next traveled to San Diego for a series with the Padres. They dropped the first game of the series 2-1. Kemp had four hits, including a home run the next night as the Dodgers offense finally showed some life and they beat the Padres 8-2. The Dodgers finished off their last road trip of the season with an 8-4 victory over the Padres, with both A.J. Ellis and Luis Cruz driving in 2 runs in the game.|$|E

500|$|Cruttwell's {{relations}} with his colleagues and {{students have been}} the subject of contradictory reports. [...] Waugh's biographer, Selena Hastings, describes him as of [...] "unprepossessing" [...] appearance, [...] "good-hearted but difficult", inclined to misogyny, brusque and sometimes offensive towards his male colleagues. Waugh's description is of someone [...] "tall, almost loutish, with the face of a petulant baby", of indistinct speech, who [...] "smoked a pipe which was attached to his blubber-lips <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thread</b> of slime". Stannard records that Waugh's student contemporary Christopher Hollis, found nothing particularly remarkable about Cruttwell. [...] "Like Waugh", says Stannard, [...] "Cruttwell played up his eccentricities and had an uncharitable sense of humour". Ellis's 2004 biographical sketch suggests that much of Cruttwell's rebarbative manner, may have been the result of simple shyness.|$|E
500|$|Kosygin, {{along with}} Alexey Kuznetsov and Voznesensky, formed a Troika in the {{aftermath}} of the war, with all three being promoted up the Soviet hierarchy by high-standing officials such as Stalin. There is a theory that Lavrentiy Beria and Georgy Malenkov plotted against them in 1950, and initiated what became known as the Leningrad Affair, which consisted of several fabricated criminal charges against Kuznetsov and Voznesensky. Both were executed. Kosygin's life, which was connected to Kuznetsov through marriage, was hanging <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thread.</b> How or why Kosygin survived the show trials is unknown, but he, as some jokes say, [...] "must have drawn a lucky lottery ticket". Nikita Khrushchev blamed Beria and Malenkov for the innocent deaths of Kuznetsov and Voznesensky, and accused Malenkov in 1957 of having concocted the plot so that either Malenkov or Beria would succeed Stalin upon his death.|$|E
