Traits {{included in this study}} were metabolic body weight, feed intake and residual feed intake (RFI) for bull performance and birth weight and average daily gain for progeny performance. The variance and covariance components were estimated by the REML method with the VCE computer program. The metabolic body weight of <b>breeding</b> <b>bulls</b> ranged from 92. 88 ± 1. 22 to 106. 05 ± 2. 28 kg. The average daily feed intake of <b>breeding</b> <b>bulls</b> differed significantly (p< 0. 05). The RFI of <b>breeding</b> <b>bulls</b> were ranged from- 0. 57 ± 0. 07 to 0. 54 ± 0. 06 kg/day.

Preferential traits for <b>breeding</b> <b>bulls</b> were in the order; aggression and mating behaviour (1. 86), tick and disease resistance (1. 90), body condition score (2. 69), scrotal circumference (4. 52), body size and conformation (4. 71) and coat colour (5. 02). For breeding cows,preferential order were; tick and disease resistance (1. 55), reproductive efficiency (2. 02), body condition score (3. 14), body size and conformation (4. 21), coat colour (4. 74) and milk yield (5. 31). Less old farmers (50 years), females and those from small-scale enterprises had odds ratio estimates less than one for the sixth ranked milk yield in Nguni cows.

Between February and May 2016, ZOO Tabor built a brand new pen (area of about 0.5 hectare). ZOO Tabor decided to breed the genetically most valuable line, so called Lowland line of European bison (which is more suitable for the reintroduction). ZOO Tabor got two cows (three years old Usjana and five years old Uselina) from the ZOO in Nuremberg and two one year old cows (Norma and Norisa) from a private owner Insel Usedom Wisentgehege in north Germany. All four cows were transported to ZOO Tabor in May 2016.

The baby elephant is reared by elephant expert and animal trainer Josef Hack with the bottle because Ceylon had no milk and died three months after giving birth. The dolphins Sindbad and Skipper became a further attraction on 19 June 1965; they were the first trained dolphins from Florida ever to be shown in an inland European country.
