40|$|Abstract. Despite control {{programs}} {{based on}} mass drug administration (MDA) of microfilaricidal compounds, <b>Bancroftian</b> lymphatic <b>filariasis</b> remains {{a problem in}} French Polynesia. For an alternative strategy to MDA, we investigated the potential role of Wolbachia to control filarial transmission. Wolbachia are intracellular -proteobacteria endosymbionts that infect {{a broad range of}} insects and nematodes. These bacteria have a suspected role in the patho-genesis of filariasis. They also may be useful in mosquito control through cytoplasmic incompatibility. To detect and characterize these bacteria in the filarial and mosquito-vectors in French Polynesia, a survey was conducted on field-collected mosquitoes and microfilariae from infected people. Samples were analyzed by a polymerase chain reaction and gene sequencing. The results indicate that these bacteria are widespread. Sequence analysis of the wsp and ftsZ genes positioned the Aedes polynesiensis Wolbachia in cluster A and Wuchereria bancrofti var. pacifica Wolbachia in cluster D. The implications for possible improved treatment and vector control are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Human filarial infections afflict over 150 million persons {{worldwide}} and are major causes of morbidity {{in many developing}} countries. Onchocerca volvulus infection is a leading preventable cause of blindness, while <b>bancroftian</b> and brugian <b>filariasis</b> may produce lymphatic obstruction of the genitalia and extremities (elephantiasis). Definitive diagnosis of these helminthic infections currently depends on demonstration of microfilariae in host tissues, i. e., the skin {{in the case of}} O. volvulus and the bloodstream in the cases of Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi. Many investigations are now directed at developing specific and sensitive serum antigen assays that will allow diagnosis of active infection (i. e., presence of adult-stage parasites) in the absence of detectable microfilariae. With respect to the immunology of these parasitic infections, efforts are being directed at elucidating the role of T- and B-cell responses in the development of pathologic lesions and resistance to reinfection. These data as well as molecular biologic approaches to identify and study filarial molecules which are immunogenic are discussed. Finally, since treatment of filariases at present depends on antiparasitic drugs, the clinical indications and dosages of diethylcarbamazine and ivermectin are summarized...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{epidemiological}} data {{to see if}} there are sex differentials in prevalence, density and clinical pathology due to lymphatic filariasis. Of 53 studies from Africa, South East Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and The Americas, 43 showed a lower mean prevalence of infection in females than in males. Prevalence is consistently lower in women of reproductive age and this is statistically significant in 16 of 32 studies classified by age and sex. Density of infection is also lower in the reproductive age but may be higher in children and in older women. Clinical disease is also lower in women and pathology has a later age of onset and rise to peak prevalence than in males. The paper assesses the evidence that lower rates of infection and clinical pathology are due to less exposure of females to infective vectors. It seems unlikely that exposure alone could account for these differences which are observed for both <b>bancroftian</b> and brugian <b>filariasis,</b> irrespective of periodicity. Several investigators have suggested that females have increased resistance to infection and this is supported by serological studies showing high antibody positivity to adult worm antigens in females. The review concludes that the association with the reproductive years suggests a pregnancy-associated mechanism. This has important implications for maternal - fetal interactions and maternal filarial infection may influence the development of immunity in childre...|$|R

40|$|Background: Human malaria {{is still}} a burden in Dak Nong and Binh Phuoc Provinces in south-central Vietnam that border Cambodia. Several Anopheles species that {{transmit}} human malarial Plasmodium may also transmit Wuchereria bancrofti, the nematode that causes <b>Bancroftian</b> lymphatic <b>filariasis.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the role of Anopheles species in the transmission of these two pathogens in the two highly malaria endemic provinces of Vietnam. Methods: Anopheles mosquitoes were collected in Dak Nong and Binh Phuoc Provinces in November and December of 2010 and 2011. Human landing catches, paired collections on human and buffalo, and resting captures were made with mouth aspirators. Collections were also made with light traps. Morphological and PCR-based methods were used to identify the species. Real-time PCR was used to detect Plasmodium species and W. bancrofti in individual mosquitoes. Results: Twenty-four Anopheles species were identified among 797 captured mosquitoes. Anopheles dirus was found in both provinces and was the predominant species in Binh Phuoc Province; An. maculatus was the most prevalent species in Dak Nong Province. Anopheles minimus was collected only in Binh Phuoc Province. Some specimens of An. minimus and An. pampanai were misidentified based on morphology. Four specimens of An. scanloni were identified, and this is the first report of this species of the Dirus Complex in Vietnam. Two females, one An. dirus and one An. pampanai, collected in Binh Phuoc Province were infected with P. vivax, for an overall infection rate of 0. 41 % (2 / 486) : 0. 28 % for An. dirus (1 / 361) and 20 % for An. pampanai (1 / 5). No mosquitoes were found to be infected with P. falciparum, P. knowlesi or W. bancrofti in either province. Conclusion: A diversity of Anopheles species occurs in Dak Nong and Binh Phuoc Provinces of Vietnam, several of which are considered to be actual and potential vectors of malarial protozoa and microfilariae. It is highly likely that two of the species, An. dirus and An. pampanai, are active in malaria transmission based on the detection of P. vivax in females of these species. This is the first report of An. scanloni in Vietnam...|$|R

40|$|Mosquitoes in the Culex pipiens complex {{thrive in}} {{temperate}} and tropical regions worldwide, {{and serve as}} efficient vectors of <b>Bancroftian</b> lymphatic <b>filariasis</b> (LF) caused by Wuchereria bancrofti in Asia, Africa, the West Indies, South America, and Micronesia. However, members of this mosquito complex do not act as natural vectors for Brugian LF caused by Brugia malayi, or for the cat parasite B. pahangi, despite their presence in South Asia where these parasites are endemic. Previous work with the Iowa strain of Culex pipiens pipiens demonstrates that it is equally susceptible to W. bancrofti as is the natural Cx. p. pipiens vector in the Nile Delta, however it is refractory to infection with Brugia spp. Here we report that the infectivity barrier for Brugia spp. in Cx. p. pipiens is the mosquito midgut, which inflicts internal and lethal damage to ingested microfilariae. Following per os Brugia exposures, the prevalence of infection is significantly lower in Cx. p. pipiens compared to susceptible mosquito controls, and differs between parasite species with < 50 % and < 5 % of Cx. p. pipiens becoming infected with B. pahangi and B. malayi, respectively. When Brugia spp. mf were inoculated intrathoracically to bypass the midgut, larvae developed equally well as in controls, indicating that, beyond the midgut, Cx. p. pipiens is physiologically compatible with Brugia spp. Mf isolated from Cx. p. pipiens midguts exhibited compromised motility, and unlike mf derived from blood or isolated from the midguts of Ae. aegypti, failed to develop when inoculated intrathoracically into susceptible mosquitoes. Together these data strongly support {{the role of the}} midgut as the primary infection barrier for Brugia spp. in Cx. p. pipiens. Examination of parasites recovered from the Cx. p. pipiens midgut by vital staining, and those exsheathed with papain, suggest that the damage inflicted by the midgut is subcuticular and disrupts internal tissues. Microscopic studies of these worms reveal compromised motility and sharp bends in the body; and ultrastructurally the presence of many fluid or carbohydrate-filled vacuoles in the hypodermis, body wall, and nuclear column. Incubation of Brugia mf with Cx. p. pipiens midgut extracts produces similar internal damage phenotypes; indicating that the Cx. p. pipiens midgut factor(s) that damage mf in vivo are soluble and stable in physiological buffer, and inflict damage on mf in vitro...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most obvious}} sign of infection, elephantiasis, is the {{enlargement}} of the limbs. A late complication of infection, elephantiasis {{is a form of}} lymphedema and is caused by repeated inflammation of the lymphatic vessels. Repeated inflammatory reactions causes vessel dilation and thickening of the affected lymphatic vessels, which can compromise function. The lymphatic system normally functions to maintain fluid balance between tissues and the blood and serves {{as an integral part of}} the immune system. Blockage of these vessels due to inflammatory induced fibrosis, dead worms, or granulomatous reactions can interfere with normal fluid balance, thus leading to swelling in the extremities. [...] Elephantiasis resulting from B. malayi infection typically affects the distal portions of the extremities. Unlike <b>bancroftian</b> <b>filariasis,</b> B. malayi rarely affects genitalia and does not cause funiculitis, orchitis, epididymitis, hydrocele, or chyuria, conditions more readily observed with bancroftian infection.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between the Wolbachia bacteria and B. malayi is not fully understood. Extrapolating from research done with Wuchereria bancrofti, another nematode that causes filariasis, Wolbachia may aid in embryogenesis of the worm, be responsible for potent inflammatory responses from macrophages and filarial disease, and {{be linked to the}} onset of lyphodema and blindness sometimes associated with B. malayi infections. In a study done by the University of Bonn in Ghana, doxycycline effectively depleted Wolbachia from W. bancrofti. It is likely that the mechanism of doxycycline is similar to that in other filarial species, i.e., a predominant blockade of embryogenesis, leading to a decline of microfilariae according to their half-life. This could render doxycycline treatment an additional tool for the treatment of microfilaria-associated diseases in <b>bancroftian</b> <b>filariasis,</b> along with B. malayi fiariasis. The doxycycline course of treatment would be much shorter as it would make the adult worm sterile in one shot rather than repeatedly have to target the replenished larvae that current treatments kill, and there would be fewer side effects for the infected individual.|$|E
5000|$|A goal of {{community}} base efforts {{is to eliminate}} microfilariae from the blood of infected individuals {{in order to prevent}} transmission to the mosquito. This is primarily accomplished through the use of drugs. The treatment for B. malayi infection is the same as for <b>bancroftian</b> <b>filariasis.</b> Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) has been used in mass treatment programs in the form of DEC-medicated salt, as an effective microfilaricidal drug in several locations, including India. [...] While DEC tends to cause adverse reactions like immediate fever and weakness, it is not known to cause any long-term adverse drug effects. DEC has been shown to kill both adult worms and microfilariae. In Malaysia, DEC dosages (6 mg/kg weekly for 6 weeks; 6 mg/kg daily for 9 days) reduced microfilariae by 80% for 18-24 months after treatment in the absence of mosquito control. [...] Microfilariae numbers slowly return many months after treatment, thus requiring multiple drug doses over time in order to achieve long-term control. However, it is not known how many years of mass drug administration is required to eliminate transmission. But currently, there have been no confirmed cases of DEC resistance.|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{hydrocele}} is {{the accumulation}} of fluid around the testis leading {{to an increase in}} the volume of the scrotal contents. Depending on the volume of fluid, hydrocele can be disfiguring and even incapacitating. Chronic hydrocele has multiple etiologies, but irrespective of the cause, surgery is the standard form of treatment and this can be done using different surgical techniques. The prevalence of chronic hydrocele in <b>bancroftian</b> <b>filariasis</b> endemic areas—a parasitic disease transmitted by mosquito—is very high and represents the most common clinical manifestation of bancroftosis, following by swollen legs of lower limbs or lymphedema among women.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the value of scrotal {{ultrasound}} as a means of evaluating <b>Bancroftian</b> <b>filariasis.</b> Color Doppler ultrasound examinations were performed to look for subclinical hydroceles and motile adult filarial worms (dancing worms) in dilated lymphatics. Sixty-one male subjects from a filariasis-endemic area in Egypt were studied including 19 clinically normal microfilaria (MF) carriers (seven with dancing worms and eight with subclinical hydroceles), 13 MF-negative subjects with positive filarial antigen test results (three with dancing worms and seven with subclinical hydroceles), 22 exposed subjects with no MF and negative antigen test results (no dancing worms, four subclinical hydroceles), and seven subjects with clinical filariasis (no dancing worms, seven hydroceles). Thus, all men tested with clinical filariasis and most clinically normal subjects with either microfilaremia or filarial antigenemia had abnormal ultrasound examination results.

A sample of 418 participants positive for <b>bancroftian</b> <b>filariasis</b> and or with clinical filarial disease were recruited. Pre and post treatment levels of microfilaria were determined by night blood sample collection and geohelminth infection was determined indirectly by egg counts. Out of these 418, 259 (62 %) were found to have at least one specie of geohelminth infection. These were physically examined and were randomly assigned to the two treatment aIDlS (ivermectin -albendazole or ivermectin placebo) and followed for 96 hours to monitor for any drug related side effects. Those who developed side effects were managed accordingly. Results showed that the overall prevalence of <b>bancroftian</b> <b>filariasis</b> and geohelminth was 13. 7 % and 44. 7 % respectively. The overall reduction on percentage and intensity of <b>bancroftian</b> <b>filariasis</b> and geohelminth infections were found to be higher in ivermectin-albendazole treatment arm (100 % and 78. 4 % respectively) compared to ivermectin -placebo regime (reduced lymphatic and geohelminth by 97. 8 % and Vll! 45. 83 % respectively). Similar levels of reductions were noted on infections with different geohelminth species. Side effects were reported from six hours after drug administration reaching peak at 24 hours and declined from 72 hours. Headache and changes in respiratory rates were the major side effects associated with ivermectin -albendazole arm while high fever and dizziness were associated with ivermectin -placebo treatment regime. In conclusion, at short-term observation, the ivermectin -albendazole combination was noted to be more efficacious and safe in treatment of both parasites than ivennectin placebo regime. It is recommended that a long term evaluation on sustainability of these reduced parasites levels are conducted at three and six months respectively...|$|E

40|$|Background: Chronic {{hydrocele}} is {{the most}} common manifestation of <b>bancroftian</b> <b>filariasis,</b> an endemic disease in 80 countries. In a prospective study, we evaluated the occurrence of intrascrotal lymphangiectasia, gross appearance/ consistency of the testis, and the efficacy of complete excision of hydrocele sac in patients living in a <b>bancroftian</b> <b>filariasis</b> endemic area who underwent hydrocelectomy at the Center for Teaching, Research and Tertiary Referral for <b>Bancroftian</b> <b>Filariasis</b> (NEPAF). Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 968 patients with uni- or bilateral filarial hydrocele (Group- 1) and a Comparison Group (CG) of 218 patients from the same area who already had undergone hydrocele-sac-sparing hydrocelectomy elsewhere were enrolled at NEPAF. Twenty-eight patients from the Comparison Group with hydrocele recurrence were reoperated on at NEPAF and constitute Group- 2. In Group- 1 a total of 1, 128 hydrocelectomies were performed (mean patient age of 30. 3 yr and mean follow-up of 8. 6 yr [range 5. 3 – 12]). The hydrocele recurrence rates in Group- 1 and in the Comparison Group (mean age of 31. 5 yr) were 0. 3 %, and 19. 3 %, respectively (p, 0, 001). There was no hydrocele recurrence in Group- 2 (mean patient age of 25. 1 yr and mean follow-up of 6 yr [range 5 – 6. 9]). Per surgically leaking or leak-prone dilated lymphatic vessels were seen in the inner or outer surface of the hydrocele sac wall or in surrounding tissue, particularly in the retrotesticular area, in 30. 9 % and in 46. 3 % of patients in Group- 1 and Group- 2, respectively (p = 0. 081).

40|$|Abstract. The immunodiagnosis of <b>bancroftian</b> <b>filariasis</b> {{is a major}} {{challenge}} to the immunoparasitologist. Significant progress {{is yet to be}} made in developing convenient laboratory animal model and in in vitro cultivation of filarial parasites making it very difficult to obtain required amount of parasite material for research. Parasitological examination techniques are not useful in low microfilaraemia, occult or chronic. filarial infections. A precise and accurate immunodiagnostic technique is very much needed for successful filaria control programmes. Such a test will also avoid the need for laborious night blood examination in <b>bancroftian</b> <b>filariasis.</b> Due to comparatively easy availability, a good amount of work has been done to explore immunodiagnostic potential of heterologous filarial antigens isolated from Litomosoide carinii, Dirofilaria immitis, Brugia malayi, Setaria digitata, Setaria cervi and number of other filarial species. However, there has been limited or no significant success due to number of false negative and false positive reactions. Extensive study has also been made with antigens isolated from Wuchereria bancrofti microfilariae. Soluble antigens of microfilariae have been used in different immunologica...|$|E
