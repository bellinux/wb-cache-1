25|$|At 06:00 on 7 June B Company intercepted a {{communist}} company attempting {{to enter the}} town, and after blocking the exit and entry routes—and again supported by armour—they forced them to withdraw. On the second day the clearing of the village continued. D Company, with a platoon from B Company attached, met sporadic resistance {{from a number of}} small groups still holed up in the village. To fully clear the village every <b>bunker,</b> <b>house</b> and any likely areas of concealment had to be searched. Later in the morning South Vietnamese forces in the northern hamlet of Duc Trung came under attack, and B Company and the Assault Pioneer Platoon were deployed to provide assistance. Indeed, most of the action now centred on Duc Trung, with a helicopter reporting a force of up to 80 communist troops moving between the buildings. With the pioneers blocking to the south a Regional Force reaction company cleared the village, however the VC had already left. By 13:00 heavy firing again broke out in Duc Trung, with the South Vietnamese rapidly overrun by over a hundred communists. Accurate artillery fire was effective in stabilising the situation, however, and B Company with a troop of tanks swept the hamlet. During the afternoon D Company continued to clear Binh Ba and further close-quarter fighting followed before the Australians withdrew to allow the South Vietnamese to complete the clearance. By the evening the village was secure, and B and D Companies adopted blocking positions overnight.|$|E
50|$|Two of Archie's cousins are depicted: Oscar, who dies off-camera in the <b>Bunker</b> <b>house</b> {{during a}} visit, and cousin Bertha (played by Peggy Rea, who {{appears in the}} same episode), {{apparently}} a somewhat distant cousin, as Archie does not recognize her.|$|E
50|$|Later, {{two police}} {{investigators}} {{arrive at the}} <b>Bunker</b> <b>house,</b> announcing they had picked up an apparently injured man wandering around in a back alley who fit the description of a subject wanted {{in a series of}} sexual assaults. At first, they mistakenly restrain Archie - thinking he is the rapist but Mike clears that up almost immediately. When the investigators attempt to get a statement from Edith, she immediately flees the room in a panic when she is shown the tie Lambert left behind in the closet with his hat, jacket and fake badge.|$|E

She later rents Mike and Gloria's former room at the <b>Bunker</b> <b>house.</b> She called Archie [...] "Papi". Torres had just completed the first season of the CBS sitcom Phyllis in the spring of 1976 before being dropped from the cast.

Torres joined All in the Family in the fall of 1976, but her character was not popular with viewers, and the role was phased out {{before the end of the}} season.|$|E
50|$|News reporters {{talk about}} how the {{wreckage}} confirms the video going worldwide. Sophie is shown in the <b>bunker</b> <b>house</b> playing with a doll, when the alligator walks in. He tells her that she is no longer Sophie, but Lucy. He introduces himself as Rupert Turner. He takes her hand and walks her out of the room into a living room where a woman (the chauffeur from earlier) and man (the baggage loader from before the flight) stand before her. The woman calls herself her mother, Annie, and the man her brother, Ed. (Sophie does have both of her eyes.) The film ends with them walking hand in hand out of the building.|$|E

5000|$|Ling-Chieh [...] "Louis" [...] Kung, {{the nephew}} of Soong Mei-ling, built an {{underground}} bunker in Montgomery, which was completed in 1982. Kung took money that he made from {{the success of the}} Westland Oil Development Corp. in the 1970s and used it to build the bunker, since he feared that the Soviet Union or the People's Republic of China would launch nuclear weapons towards the United States. Kung bought hundreds of acres of cow pasture on the outskirts of Montgomery and secretly began building the bunker. The two story, 40000 sq ft bunker could house at least 700 people; Kung intended to have the <b>bunker</b> <b>house</b> his employees, their families, and others in case of a two-month emergency. Melanie Trottmann of The Wall Street Journal stated that the bunker [...] "was a source of intrigue and gossip for the town of Montgomery." [...] After the oil bust in the 1980s, Kung lost the title to the property; Kung died in 1996. Trottman said that the bunker [...] "sat frozen in time" [...] until a group of investors bought the property. The facility, now called [...] "Westland Bunker," [...] serves as a data storage center for businesses. The facility also contains office space that corporations could use {{in the event of a}} disaster.|$|E
5000|$|Betty Garrett and Vincent Gardenia as {{the liberal}} and Roman Catholic next-door neighbors Irene and Frank Lorenzo: Both first {{appeared}} as a married couple as Irene was {{trying to use the}} Bunker's phone. During an argument earlier in the episode, Archie and Mike had broken the phone wire. Irene being a 'handyman' of sorts with her own tools, which she carried in her purse, fixed it. Irene fixed many things at the <b>Bunker</b> <b>house</b> during her time on the show. She also had a sister who was a nun and appeared in one episode. [...] "Edith's Christmas Story" [...] reveals that Irene has had a mastectomy. Archie got her a job as a forklift operator at the plant where he worked. Irene was a strong-willed woman of Irish heritage, and Frank was a jovial Italian househusband who loved cooking and singing. He also was a salesman, but what he sold was never said. Gardenia, who also appeared as Jim Bowman in episode eight of season one (as the man who sold his house to the Jeffersons) and as Curtis Rempley in episode seven of season three (as a swinger opposite Rue McClanahan), became a semiregular along with Garrett in 1973. Gardenia only stayed for one season as Frank Lorenzo, but Garrett remained until her character was phased out in late 1975.|$|E

50|$|Jo then sees lights outside from land. She {{claims that}} they shouldn't be {{anywhere}} near land. Max pulls the screen {{off the wall}} and punches the wall and hooks the screen to power cords inside the wall. The screen pulls up and shows that their destination is not New York, but Oslo, Norway. Round 3 begins, Do or Die. They will be given an assignment and if they do not follow more deaths will commence. Jo goes into the bathroom and puts on the headphones. Her mission is not known, but if she fails to follow or tells someone her daughter would be killed. Sophie is then shown on the screen inside a <b>bunker</b> <b>house.</b> Jo comes out of the bathroom and takes her seat. Max asks her questions but she refuses to answer or look at them. Dave enters the bathroom and puts on the headsets. If he doesn't follow his fiancée, Sarah, will be killed. Dave exits the bathroom crying. Gwen is next. Gwen hesitates but does the same as the others. Instead she hears crying from her sister. On the screen it shows the man pouring petrol on her. Max is last. He refuses to go until Dave tells him to. On the screen it shows his brother, Mike, tied to a table with the man holding a machete. Max exits and they sit in silent. The alligator tells them that they have 45 minutes to complete their mission, if not their special person dies. At the 45 minute mark the plane would crash into the All2gether.com building and they would all die. Max grabs an Ax and begins to tear apart the plane. The alligator instructs Max to put down the axe or his brother will die. Max does so, but because he gave away some of his mission, the man chops off Mike's arm. Max tells the alligator that he isn't really Max. He explains that he hacked into Max's account and changed everything, that he thought they would've caught him at the airport seeing as how he was 25 and Max was 21, but they didn't. He refuses to tell them who he really is. Dave ends up furious and fights with Max. Jo instructs him to prove who he is. Max pulls out a carton of cigarettes and his passport. Dave believes he is telling the truth. He then walks into the bathroom and puts on the headphones. The alligator instructs that they have all revealed clues to their missions and the result must be consequences. Dave tells the alligator he knows who Max really is. The screen ends on a picture of his fiancée. Jo makes her way to the bar and grabs a bottle of wine. She pours three glasses and Max drinks all three. Back in the bathroom, Dave pleas with the alligator to let his fiancée go, but the alligator says that he has another task and instructs Dave to kill one of the passengers in 3 minutes. Dave grabs the axe and threatens them. Swinging it he attacks Max hitting him in the chest. Max kicks the axe away and they begin attacking each other. Dave grabs a bottle and Max grabs the axe. Dave hits him in the head and Max kills Dave. The alligator then kills Sarah.|$|E
