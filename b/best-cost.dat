40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{identify}} <b>best-cost</b> countries for SKF to source Rings, an important group of direct materials used in bearing. This exploration would give the major distinction between two sourcing approaches, <b>best-cost</b> country sourcing and low-cost country sourcing. While low-cost country sourcing focuses on low purchasing price, low labor cost and low material cost, <b>best-cost</b> country sourcing builds the foundation on {{total cost of ownership}} and country risk analysis. Methodology - In order to identify <b>best-cost</b> countries, the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods are used. Data was collected from literature, interviews with SKF’s global category managers, SKF internal data as well as external sources of information. Potential countries were recommended by SKF’s global category managers during the interviews. Statistical data of different parameters were collected for these countries. To make the data comparable, all data was converted into one standard scale. This was made by using mean standard deviation and scoring scheme risk analysis. After that a development funnel method was applied to analyze and conclude the <b>best-cost</b> countries. Finding - In this project, the requirements for a country to be chosen as a <b>best-cost</b> country for SKF to source Rings are: (1) country should have low total cost of ownership; (2) the risks connected to sourcing from a country should be low and if they exist, they should be manageable; (3) country should have available materials including steel bars, steel tubes, as well as available forging operation and casting operation to produce Rings, and (4) SKF’s local and regional sourcing strategy should be met. To meet these conditions, the list of different parameters which impact on the selection and evaluation of <b>best-cost</b> countries are provided. Contribution - This thesis contributes to the academic knowledge by providing a framework, a list of requirements and parameters which are important for the selection and evaluation of <b>best-cost</b> country. From the business perspective, this thesis’ finding at country level enables the company to go further into supplier level, to search for and work with potential suppliers in determined <b>best-cost</b> countries. Besides that, methodologies, insights and sources of information provide the baseline and reference from which, the company may expand the project to identify <b>best-cost</b> countries for other categories. Moreover, the know-how given how to select and analyze <b>best-cost</b> country would be helpful within different companies and industries...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{describes}} detailed {{simulations of}} solar thermal parabolic trough power plants, non-tracked and two-axis-tracked PV systems. Altogether 61 sites in Europe and North Africa covering a global annual irradiation range from 923 to 2438 kWh/(m a) have been chosen. Simulation results are usable irradiation by the systems, specific annual system output and levelised electricity costs. Costs as-sumptions {{are made for}} today’s costs and expected costs in 10 years considering different learning curves for the three techniques. This {{will lead to a}} cost reduction by 50 % for PV systems and by 40 % for solar thermal power plants. The simulation results clearly point the optimal irradiation range for the best sys-tem output and <b>best-cost</b> solution of the different system variants. At low irradiation values the annual output of solar thermal systems is much lower than of PV systems. On the contrary, at high irradiation values solar thermal systems provide the <b>best-cost</b> solution even in 10 years if we consider higher cost re-duction factors for PV. Electricity generation costs much below 10 Eurocents per kWh for solar thermal systems and about 15 Eurocents/kWh for PV can be expected in 10 years in North Africa...|$|E
40|$|Weighted timed automata are timed automata {{annotated}} with {{costs on}} locations and transitions. The optimal game-reachability problem for these automata {{is to find}} the <b>best-cost</b> strategy of supplying the inputs so as to ensure reachability of a target set within a specified number of iterations. The only known complexity bound for this problem is a doubly-exponential upper bound. We establish a singly-exponential upper bound and show that there exist automata with exponentially many states in a single region with pair-wise distinct optimal strategies...|$|E

40|$|In many applications, {{especially}} autonomous exploration, {{there is}} a trade-off inherent in the way resource usage is es-timated at planning-time: to maintain {{the safety of the}} agent, the plan must be robust to pessimistic outcomes; yet, to max-imise the amount of activities undertaken, resources must be used to their full potential. In this paper we consider a method of planning that maintains operational safety, by detailing ad-ditional plan fragments to be performed at execution-time on an ‘opportunistic ’ basis, if conditions permit. We consider planning problems with soft goals, each with an attached cost paid if the goal is not achieved. Our plan representation is a tree structure, with simple execution-time rules: take the <b>best-cost</b> branch, given some associated resource level con-straint. We demonstrate the use of such plans can potentially dramatically increase utility, whilst still obeying strict safety constraints. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Computing lower bounds to the <b>best-cost</b> {{extension}} of a tuple is an ubiquous task in constraint optimization. A particular case {{of special interest}} is the computation of lower bounds to all singleton tuples, since it permits domain pruning in Branch and Bound algorithms. In this paper we introduce MCTE(z), a general algorithm which allows the computation of lower bounds to arbitrary sets of tasks. Its time and accuracy grows {{as a function of}} z allowing a controlled tradeoff between lower bound accuracy and time and space to fit available resources. Subsequently, a specialization of MCTE(z) called MBTE(z) is tailored to computing lower bounds to singleton tuples. Preliminary experiments on Max-CSP show that using MBTE(z) to guide dynamic variable and value orderings in branch and bound yields a dramatic reduction in the search space and, for some classes of problems, this reduction is highly costeffective producing significant time savings and is competitive against specialized algorithms for Max-CSP. ...|$|E
40|$|Part 5 : Aeronautical and Automotive EngineeringInternational audienceAirlines {{companies}} {{trust in}} MRO facilities for extending lifespan {{of their assets}} to ensure the availability of transportation services. Nevertheless, MRO services are complex because they involve several processes whose performance depends on the design and manufacturing of products while airlines require the <b>best-cost</b> efficiency, quality and safety. Product lifecycle management (PLM) could improve the productivity and quality of MRO since it enables the collaborative creation, management, dissemination, use, maintenance and repair of products and its operational process information across the entire life of products from market concept to product retirement. However, it seems that PLM and MRO relationship in the aeronautical industry has been studied very sparsely in the literature. This paper attempts {{to gain a better}} understanding of the influence of product life management system in MRO services. The objectives of this study are twofold: 1) to identify MRO provider’s requirements concerning PLM systems, and 2) to assess how PLM system could be improved to better support MRO services...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Probability of Raid Annihilation, PRA, is the Navy’s Measure of {{a single}} ship with its combat systems to detect, control, engage and defeat a {{specified}} raid of threats within a specified level of probability in an operational environment. Threat performance and combat system performance both can vary significantly with natural environment conditions so the PRA federation incorporates these effects. In an earlier paper (01 F-SIW- 077), uncertainty in the PRA Measure or federation outcome was linked mathematically to uncertainty in the implemented natural environment representation. This procedure {{was based on the}} detailed docu-mentation and analysis provided by the PRA Environment Concept Model (ECM). In this paper uncertainty results are presented using this procedure. The uncertainty assessment includes a reasonable range of uncertainties in the individ-ual environment parameters but maintains consistency within the environment representation by means of the ECM. Maintaining consistency is required because the uncertainty analysis shows that the uncertainty in PRA Measure depends not only on the magnitude of uncertainty in an environment parameter but also on the overall environment representation supplied. The uncertainty analysis not only provides an assessment of how good the PRA Measure is but also provides information on the <b>best-cost</b> benefit to improvement in the PRA measure. 1...|$|E
40|$|An ad hoc {{wireless}} {{mobile network}} is an infrastructure-less mobile network {{that has no}} fixed routers; instead, all nodes are capable of movement and can be connected dynamically in an arbitrary manner. In order to facilitate communication of mobile nodes {{that may not be}} within the wireless range of each other, an efficient routing protocol is used to discover routes between nodes so that messages may be delivered in a timely manner. In this paper, we present a novel Load-Balanced Ad hoc Routing (LBAR) protocol for communication in wireless ad hoc networks. LBAR defines a new metric for routing known as the degree of nodal activity to represent the load on a mobile node. In LBAR routing information on all paths from source to destination are forwarded through setup messages to the destination. Setup messages include nodal activity information of all nodes on the traversed path. After collecting information on all possible paths, the destination then makes a selection of the path with the <b>best-cost</b> value and sends an acknowledgement to the source node. LBAR also provides an alternate path maintenance technique to patch up broken links by detouring traffic to the destination. A comprehensive simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. Performance results show that LBAR outperforms existing ad hoc routing protocols in terms of packet delivery and average end-to-end delay...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{genetic algorithms}} for inducing high-level knowledge from available domain data, succeeding to obtain generalized solutions for a short-stage multi-channel queuing model. The domain of application, {{refers to the}} transportation problem of transit storage and re-load in seaports. Specifically, when a ship approaches the port, can be served {{by more than one}} service channel, in other words the seaport represents a queuing system. The seaport system forwards ships and lorries into the port, moves vehicles and cranes between two positions i. e. warehouses and berths, and finally loads and unloads cargoes from ships and lorries. Between the two load/unload processes taking place in both, ships and lorries, the transit storage process is embedded, thus forming in fact a three stage multi-channel queuing system. The standard process of working with such a queuing problem supposes Poisson distribution in all the service stages, definition of the service and waiting costs and the construction of an objective function for finding the <b>best-cost</b> solution. The solution produced above is generalized by applying a genetic algorithm approach for finding the best seaport configuration (i. e. optimal number of cranes, warehouses and lorries needed) among a possible set of them, which will offer the minimum seaport operating cost. The paper demonstrates that, when a set of possible configurations is effectively coded into a genetic population, the best solution might be achieved in a reasonably short time and well approximated. Keywords: queueing systems, genetic algorithms, computational intelligence, seaport operating cost optimization, transportation problems. 1...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2011. This {{case study}} explores why the {{strategic}} {{positioning of the}} wall-panel heater, manufactured by Econo-Heat, justifies a green marketing strategy. The primary research objective is to provide Econo-Heat with a coherent marketing strategy framework, based {{on the outcome of}} the strategic analysis of the competitive positioning of the wall-panel heater. The following factors form the context of the study: the impact companies have on the environment, the energy crisis and the rising “green economy” in South Africa, and the increased consumer awareness about lifestyle consequences for the environment. The wall-panel heater uses convection-heating technology to warm rooms and has unique selling properties, such as being energy efficient, economical, effective and safe. Other space-heating products found in South Africa do not encapsulate all these qualities in one product. A strategic analysis done of the company revealed that the current competitive positioning of the wall-panel heater is a <b>best-cost</b> strategy. However, based on a literature review, the strategic analysis of the company and an exploration of the small household appliance consumer profile, the study found that the current competitive positioning of the wall-panel heater could be augmented. The combination of factors revealed by this study could be interpreted as push-factors towards the implementation of an applicable green marketing strategy that could support the re-positioning of the wall-panel heater to a broad-differentiated competitive positioning. These factors are the unique selling properties of the wall-panel heater, the lean manufacturing principles of the company, the rising green economy in the country, the energy crisis and the slow recovery from the global financial crisis in South Africa, as well as the unique characteristics of the environmentally-focused consumer. The view is held that green marketing can mitigate mass consumption. The case study suggests a future marketing strategy framework that consists of three combined elements. First, the argument is made that the unique selling properties of the wall-panel heater in combination with the unique operations of the company, against the backdrop of external factors that influence companies and consumers (i. e. the rising green economy and the energy crisis), could be utilised to discover new market space. The concept of “lateral marketing” is suggested as a framework should the company position itself to differentiate along the green dimension. Secondly, the “green marketing strategy matrix” is suggested as a framework to establish the size and greenness of its consumer segment, as well as the ability to differentiate along the green dimension. Lastly, the suggestion is made that the marketing objective of the company (its greenness) can be measured through the application of a “green marketing grid” that leads to innovation and the challenging of consumer behaviour. The combination of these elements is thought to form a coherent green marketing framework that could in future place the product at a strategic and competitive advantage within the space-heating industry...|$|E
