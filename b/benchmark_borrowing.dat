The detailed study of these homogeneously catalysed reactions reveals several important implications regarding the strong influence of the pyrene tags in the catalysts. First, the catalytic activity is partially inhibited by addition of an external amount of pyrene, but only when pyrene-tagged catalysts and aromatic substrates are used. Second, the rate order of the reaction is highly dependent {{on the nature of the}} substrates and the ligand. When pyrene-tagged catalysts and aromatic substrates are used, the reaction follows a zero-order dependence on the concentration of the substrate. All other combinations afford a second-order rate in the substrates. And third, the presence or absence of the pyrene functionality in the catalyst also influences the reaction order with respect to the concentration of the catalyst. Pyrene-containing catalysts display a fractional rate order of below 1. Finally, two pyrene-tagged catalysts were supported onto reduced-graphene oxide (rGO), and used as heterogeneous catalysts. While the dimetallic catalyst was effectively recycled 12 times, the monometallic catalyst maintained its activity for only three runs.

40|$|Weighted {{coloring}} is a {{generalization of}} the well-known vertex (unweighted) coloring {{for which a}} number of exact algorithms have been presented in the literature. We {{are not aware of}} any optimal method specifically designed for the minimum-weighted coloring problem on arbitrary graphs. Only a few heuristics have been developed with the goal of finding tighter upper bounds for the maximum-weighted clique problem. Moreover, as shown in the paper, a straightforward reduction of a weighted instance into an unweighted one permits us to solve only very small instances. In this paper, we present a branch-and-bound algorithm for the weighted case capable of solving random graphs of up to 90 vertices for any edge density with integer weights uniformly drawn from the range [1, [...] ., 10]. Likewise, we have used properly modified <b>benchmark</b> instances <b>borrowed</b> from vertex coloring as a further test bed for our algorith...|$|R

This paper uses a proxy <b>benchmarking</b> by <b>borrowing</b> techniques from software engineering {{that are used to}} develop software. We argue that both software and course development are intellectual in process and product. We define an evolutionary development lifecycle methodology based on the tasks of analysis, engineering, content development, and feedback. Within engineering, we define structural design, architecture design styles, and navigation design techniques. Then we define some management challenges for a course as it is offered and maintained. The paper sets some framework for course design making use of modular approach. This allows for making use of a hybrid structure of material to allow for the instructor, or the course developer, to mix and match many components in an easy to follow and easy to maintain fashion. It is a step in developing a platform for online course development. 2 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) environment {{the possibility}} that sizeable interference effects between a heavy charged Higgs boson signal produced via bg→ tH^- (+ c. c.) scattering and decaying via H^-→ W^- A→ W^- bb̅ (+ c. c.) and the irreducible background given by bg→ t W^- bb̅ topologies could spoil current search approaches where the former and latter channels are treated separately. The rationale for this {{comes from the fact}} that a heavy charged Higgs state can have a large width, and so can happen for the CP-odd neutral Higgs state emerging in the ensuing decays well, which in turn enables such interferences. We conclude that effects are very significant, both at the inclusive and exclusive level (i. e., both before and after H^± selection cuts are enforced, respectively) and typically of a destructive nature. This therefore implies that currently established LHC reaches for heavy charged Higgs bosons require some level of rescaling. However, this is possible a posteriori, as the aforementioned H^± selection cuts shape the interference contributions at the differential level in a way similar to that of the isolated H^± signal, so there is no need to reassess the efficiency of the individual cuts. We show such effects quantitatively by <b>borrowing</b> <b>benchmarks</b> points from different Yukawa types of a 2 -Higgs Doublet Model parameter space for H^± values starting from around 200 GeV...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three self-contained papers. Chapter 1 provides a general introduction. In Chapter 2, I study the impact of collateral constraints on producers and thereby on aggregate output. In a theoretical paper, Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) show that collateral constraints that restrict the investment decisions of producers can strongly amplify and propagate aggregate shocks. However, the subsequent quantitative literature tends to find rather weak and non-robust effects of collateral constraints. I try to improve on this by modeling the interaction between idiosyncratic risk and collateral constraints. To this aim, agents' productivities as workers and entrepreneurs are assumed to evolve stochastically. This leads to a perpetual mismatch between wealth and skills, which {{is the reason for}} collateralized borrowing in this economy. The advantage of this modeling strategy is threefold. First, the evolution of skills can be measured empirically. In contrast, the heterogeneity in patience that the previous literature assumes to excite collateralized borrowing is not even intended as a serious micro-foundation. Second, idiosyncratic risk creates a non-degenerate distribution of wealth. As a consequence, the percentage of constrained agents changes as shocks hit the economy. Among other things, this generates recessions that are much sharper than booms. Last but not least, the impact of collateral constraints turns out to be larger and more robust in the setup with idiosyncratic risk compared to models with heterogeneity in patience. In the baseline calibration, an unanticipated shock that reduces total factor productivity (TFP) by one percent for only one year leads to a sharp and persistent drop in both output and the price of capital. In contrast, without financing frictions the model economy is back at the steady state within one year. Thus, collateral constraints have a substantial impact on the aggregate economy. In Chapter 3, which is joint work with Michael Grill, Felix Kübler and Karl Schmedders, we study the impact of collateral constraints on investors and thereby on asset prices. We consider an exchange economy with long-lived assets that pay risky dividends and can be used as collateral for short-term loans. Investors are heterogeneous with respect to risk-aversion. As a consequence, risk-tolerant agents invest in the risky assets and use them as collateral to borrow from the risk-averse. This investment behavior makes the risk-tolerant agents vulnerable to bad shocks in which case binding collateral constraints force them to sell some of their risky assets. The risk-averse buy these assets only after their price has dropped substantially. For this reason, collateral constraints increase the volatility of asset returns by 50 percent as compared to a <b>benchmark</b> where <b>borrowing</b> is not possible. We show that the high volatility does not substantially decrease when we allow for defaultable bonds. We also find that such bonds are only traded if the costs of default are small. The main focus of our analysis is on the case of two risky assets, where the collateral requirement is determined endogenously for one, but exogenously for the other. In particular, we assume that a regulating agency sets an exogenous margin requirement for the second asset. We find that this regulation has a strong impact on the volatility of the first asset. In particular, a tightening of margin requirements for the regulated asset uniformly decreases volatility of the unregulated asset. For the regulated asset, tighter margins initially increase the return volatility, but then decrease it once margins become very large. In Chapter 4, which is joint work with Michael Grill, we propose a method that overcomes the numerical problems caused by collateral constraints or other types of occasionally binding constraints. The method also works when policy functions need to be interpolated over several dimensions. It uses the equilibrium conditions of the model to numerically locate the kinks in policy functions which are induced by the constraints and then adds interpolation nodes exactly there. To handle the resulting non-uniform grid of interpolation nodes, it uses simplicial interpolation, which is piecewise-linear interpolation on efficiently chosen simplices. Therefore, we call this method Adaptive Simplicial Interpolation (ASI). To evaluate its performance, we embed ASI into a time iteration algorithm. We then compute recursive equilibria in an infinite horizon endowment economy where heterogeneous agents trade in a bond and a stock subject to various trading constraints. A careful analysis shows that ASI computes equilibria accurately and outperforms standard interpolation schemes by far...|$|R
