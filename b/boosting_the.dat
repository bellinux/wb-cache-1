The CBO also forecasted that repeal of ACA would likely cause an increase in GDP by an average of 0.7% in the period from 2021 to 2015, mainly by <b>boosting</b> <b>the</b> supply of labor.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} morph the dragon {{to change its}} attack, defense, agility and spiritual {{attribute}}s. Boosting one attribute diminishes another; for example, <b>boosting</b> <b>the</b> attack attribute reduces the spiritual attribute, meaning berserks require more BP, while boosting means gauges fill faster {{at the expense of}} defense. Certain berserks are only available in certain dragon configurations.|$|E
5|$|With {{the aim of}} <b>boosting</b> <b>the</b> {{recovery}} in the eurozone economy by lowering interest rates for businesses, the ECB cut its bank rates in multiple steps in 2012–2013, reaching an historic low of 0.25% in November 2013. The lowered borrowing rates have also caused the euro to fall {{in relation to other}} currencies, which is hoped will boost exports from the eurozone and further aid the recovery.|$|E

During the fifth free flight on 22 October 1948, Schoch again found it difficult to hook the Goblin to the bomber's trapeze, aborting four attempts before hitting the trapeze bar and breaking the hook on the XF-85's nose. Again, a forced landing was successfully carried out at Muroc.|$|E

With their ammunition running out, Singh ordered {{his men to}} join the main company, knowing that reinforcement was impossible under Pakistani shelling. With the help of another soldier, he brought two injured men along, though he himself was wounded. Under the heavy Pakistani fire, Singh moved from position to position, <b>boosting</b> <b>the</b> morale of his men and intermittently throwing grenades. Despite being wounded twice, he refused evacuation and continued to hold {{the first line of}} trenches.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{currency}} is the CFA franc. In the 1960s, the Mining industry of Chad produced sodium carbonate, or natron. There {{have also been}} reports of gold-bearing quartz in the Biltine Prefecture. However, years of civil war have scared away foreign investors; those who left Chad between 1979 and 1982 have only recently begun to regain confidence in the country's future. In 2000 major direct foreign investment in the oil sector began, <b>boosting</b> <b>the</b> country's economic prospects.|$|E

5|$|Smuggling off American coasts was {{an issue}} before the Revolutionary War, and after the Revolution it was more problematic. Along with smuggling, lack of {{shipping}} control, pirating, and a revenue unbalance were also major problems. In response, Hamilton proposed to Congress to enact a naval police force called revenue cutters in order to patrol the waters and assist the custom collectors with confiscating contraband. This idea was also proposed to assist in tariff controlling, <b>boosting</b> <b>the</b> American economy, and promote the merchant marine. It is thought that his experience obtained during his apprenticeship with Nicholas Kruger was influential in his decision-making.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Masonry {{was still}} strong in Western New York {{though it was}} petering out nationally, and when the Anti-Masons did not {{nominate}} him {{for a second term}} in 1834, Fillmore declined the Whig nomination, seeing that the two parties would split the anti-Jackson vote and elect the Democrat. Despite Fillmore's departure from office, he was a rival for state party leadership with Seward, the unsuccessful 1834 Whig gubernatorial candidate. Fillmore spent his time out of office building his law practice and <b>boosting</b> <b>the</b> Whig Party, which gradually absorbed most of the Anti-Masons. By 1836, Fillmore was confident enough of anti-Jackson unity that he accepted the Whig nomination for Congress. Democrats, led by their presidential candidate, Vice President Martin Van Buren, were victorious nationwide and in Van Buren's home state of New York, but Western New York voted Whig and sent Fillmore back to Washington.|$|E
5|$|Assisted {{by a large}} pre-release promotional campaign, Final Fantasy VII {{received}} widespread {{commercial and}} critical success upon release, and is still widely regarded as a landmark title {{and one of the}} greatest games of all time. It was acknowledged for <b>boosting</b> <b>the</b> sales of the PlayStation and popularizing Japanese role-playing games worldwide, with praise being given to its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some criticism was directed towards its English localization. The game won numerous Game of the Year awards, among other accolades. Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a subseries companion of media called the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, and a high-definition remake for the PlayStation 4.|$|E

Settlement of the Cyprus dispute would <b>boost</b> <b>the</b> commercial fleet to new levels, according to, Cyprus Shipping Chamber Director General and European Community Shipowners' Associations Chairman, Thomas Kazakos. Under the recent geopolitical developments the government is putting into effect recommendations of a study to help it reposition. The Cyprus Shipping Chamber director general says the five-point action plan is designed to <b>boost</b> <b>the</b> island even further against other maritime hubs and open ship registries.|$|R
5|$|Augmentation {{involves}} the supplemental release of natural enemies {{that occur in}} a particular area, <b>boosting</b> <b>the</b> naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals {{to allow them to}} reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a problem that has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.|$|E
5|$|Falling {{electricity}} production may be boosted through drilling additional supply boreholes, as at Poihipi and Ohaaki. The Wairakei power station {{has been running}} much longer, with its first unit commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering, in 1982 being derated to intermediate pressure and the station managing 157MW. Around {{the start of the}} 21st century it was managing about 150MW, then in 2005 two 8MW isopentane systems were added, <b>boosting</b> <b>the</b> station's output by about 14MW. Detailed data are unavailable, being lost due to re-organisations. One such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for Poihipi (started 1996), and the gap in 1996/7 for Wairakei and Ohaaki; half-hourly data for Ohaaki's first few months of operation are also missing, as well as for most of Wairakei's history.|$|E
5|$|His {{greatest}} {{and most}} famous wartime contribution was the Seventh Symphony. The composer {{wrote the first}} three movements in Leningrad and completed the work in Kuibyshev (now Samara) {{where he and his}} family had been evacuated. It remains unclear whether Shostakovich really conceived the idea of the symphony with the siege of Leningrad in mind, it was officially claimed as a representation of the people of Leningrad’s brave resistance to the German invaders and an authentic piece of patriotic art at a time when morale needed <b>boosting.</b> <b>The</b> symphony was first premiered by the Bolshoi Theatre orchestra in Kuibyshev and was soon performed abroad in London and the United States. The most compelling performance was the Leningrad premiere by the Radio Orchestra in the besieged city. The orchestra had only fourteen musicians left, so the conductor Karl Eliasberg had to recruit anyone who could play a musical instrument to perform the symphony.|$|E

5|$|In {{the initial}} years of operation, THSRC {{accumulated}} debt {{due to high}} depreciation charges and interest, {{largely due to the}} financial structure set up for the private company. In 2009, THSRC negotiated with the government to change the method of depreciation from depending on concessions on rights to ridership. At the same time, the government also started to help refinance THSRC's loans to assist the company so it could remain operational and profitable. In 2015, the government injected NT$30 billion as a financial bailed out, <b>boosting</b> <b>the</b> government's stake to about 64% from about 37%. The government also extended the rail concession from 35 years to 70 years and terminated the company’s build-operate-transfer business model.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century, the {{population}} sharply declined, as mechanization transferred work in cavalry and agriculture to machines. By the 1970s, the Mérens was on the verge of extinction, with only 40 horses registered in the stud book. The breed was saved by members of the hippie movement, who re-settled in the Ariège mountains, <b>boosting</b> <b>the</b> local economy and restarting breeding programs. The Mérens also benefited from a new surge in popularity in riding horses, and between 1975 and 1985 its population rebounded, leading the breeding program to be considered an example for the conservation of rare breeds. The herd size remains relatively small, however, and one genetic study considers the traditional type of the breed to be endangered and recommends that efforts should be focused on its preservation.|$|E
5|$|Since its release, Dragon Ball {{has become}} one of the most {{successful}} manga and anime series of all time. The manga's 42 volumes have sold over 156 million copies in Japan and more than 240 million copies worldwide, making it the second best-selling manga series in history. Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humor of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest manga series ever made, with many manga artists citing Dragon Ball as a source of inspiration for their own now popular works. The anime, particularly Dragon Ball Z, is also highly popular in various countries and was arguably one of the most influential in <b>boosting</b> <b>the</b> popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture.|$|E
