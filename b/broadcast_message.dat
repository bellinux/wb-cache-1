500|$|Lang was {{responsible}} for drafting King George V's silver jubilee <b>broadcast</b> <b>message</b> in 1935, and the king's last two Christmas messages. This closeness to the throne was not maintained when the king died in January 1936 and was succeeded by his son, Edward VIII. The new king was wary of Lang, whom he had once admired. Edward now found Lang to be [...] "rather... accustomed to the company of princes and statesmen, {{more interested in the}} pursuit of prestige and power than the abstractions of the human soul".|$|E

50|$|A Cell <b>Broadcast</b> <b>message</b> page is {{composed}} of 82 octets, which, using the default character set, can encode 93 characters. Up to 15 of these pages may be concatenated to form a Cell <b>Broadcast</b> <b>message.</b> Each page of such a CB message {{will have the same}} message identifier (indicating the source of the message), and the same serial number. Using this information, the mobile telephone is able to identify and ignore broadcasts of already received messages.|$|E
50|$|Thus, one Cell <b>Broadcast</b> <b>message</b> {{can reach}} {{a huge number}} of {{terminals}} at once. In other words, Cell Broadcast messages are directed to radio cells, rather than to a specific terminal. A Cell <b>Broadcast</b> <b>message</b> is an unconfirmed push service, meaning that the originator of the message does not know who has received the message, allowing for services based on anonymity. Mobile telephone user manuals describe how the user can switch the receiving of Cell Broadcast messages on or off.|$|E

30|$|Dynamic Data. The scheme {{should be}} {{cost-effective}} {{even when the}} content of the sequence of <b>broadcast</b> <b>messages</b> is not known in its entirety before hand by the base station.

5000|$|The NWS Weather Forecast Office in Greenville, South Carolina, simply used {{a message}} informing NWR {{listeners}} to [...] "stand by for important weather information" [...] when a weather warning was issued. However, {{this seems to}} have been hard-coded into the system and tests of the SAME device serving the Greenville-Spartanburg area were also prefaced with this message. This has since disappeared upon implementation of the <b>Broadcast</b> <b>Message</b> Handler. Forecast offices in Seattle, Washington, Las Vegas, Nevada, Jackson, Kentucky and Charleston, West Virginia have a similar feature; none of these offices have yet to switch over to the <b>Broadcast</b> <b>Message</b> Handler , so this 'stand by' message can still be heard on stations originating from these offices.|$|E
50|$|An {{all call}} {{is a general}} term for a <b>broadcast</b> <b>message.</b> In particular, it {{may be used to}} refer to an {{automated}} phone notification system that will quickly call individuals with a recorded message {{in the event of a}} weather-related school closing or emergency situation.|$|E
5000|$|The Southern Television {{broadcast}} interruption was {{a broadcast}} interruption through the Hannington transmitter [...] of the Independent Broadcasting Authority in the United Kingdom at 5:10 pm on 26 November 1977.

30|$|To {{test the}} {{communication}} performance, in each test round we connected all simulated MNs to the Gateways {{and then sent}} unicast messages to some MNs, <b>broadcast</b> <b>messages</b> to the Gateways on the DDS domain (Core) and <b>broadcast</b> <b>messages</b> to all MNs. For each type of message we calculated the round trip delay as {{the difference between the}} moments the message was sent and the moment the confirmation response was received.|$|R
50|$|But, as {{only one}} {{application}} can listen {{at a time}} to a given port, the xPL protocol uses a hub to retransmit all <b>broadcast</b> <b>messages</b> to the different applications on the same machine.The applications subscribe to the hub on a free port by sending hearbeat messages which specifies the port they are listening to.In turn, the hub forwards all xPL <b>broadcast</b> <b>messages</b> it receives to every application in his list.|$|R

5000|$|In January 2016, six sites {{across the}} nation were {{selected}} to begin testing a new system known as the <b>Broadcast</b> <b>Message</b> Handler (BMH), which features a new voice replacing all other voices. These six test sites include offices at Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina; Brownsville, Texas; Omaha, Nebraska; Portland, Oregon; Anchorage, Alaska; and Tiyan, Guam. A gradual nationwide implementation of the <b>Broadcast</b> <b>Message</b> Handler system began in April 2016, and lasted {{through the end of}} 2016. The name of the new voice being used on NWR is [...] "Paul" [...] (its classification from new voice partner NeoSpeech). Many stations have dubbed him [...] "Paul II" [...] or [...] "Paul Jr" [...] to avoid confusion with [...] "Perfect Paul". This has also happened on NWS offices with Spanish programming; Javier was replaced with a female voice named [...] "Violetta" [...] (another voice from NeoSpeech).|$|E
50|$|The two nodes {{adjacent}} to the core broadcast messages {{to the rest of}} the nodes in the fragment. The messages are sent via the branch edge but not via the core.

50|$|Cell <b>Broadcast</b> <b>messaging</b> was technologically {{demonstrated}} in Paris {{for the first}} time in 1997. Some mobile operators use Cell Broadcast for communicating the area code of the antenna cell to the mobile user (via channel 050), for nationwide or citywide alerting, weather reports, mass messaging, location-based news, etc. Not all operators have the Cell <b>Broadcast</b> <b>messaging</b> function activated in their network yet, and many handsets do not have the capability to support cell broadcast.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{illustrate}} {{the design of}} a crosslayered MAC and clustering solution for supporting the fast propagation of <b>broadcast</b> <b>messages</b> in a Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET). A distributed dynamic clustering algorithm is proposed to create a dynamic virtual backbone in the vehicular network. The vehicle-members of the backbone are responsible for implementing an efficient messages propagation. The backbone creation and maintenance are proactively performed aiming to balance the stability of backbone connections as well as the cost/efficiency trade-off and the hops-reduction when forwarding <b>broadcast</b> <b>messages.</b> A fast multi-hop MAC forwarding mechanism is defined to exploit the role of backbone vehicles, under a cross-layered approach. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the mutual support of proactive clustering and MAC protocols for efficient dissemination of <b>broadcast</b> <b>messages</b> in VANETs. 1...|$|R
