50|$|By mid 1944, {{using the}} Stabilizing Automatic Bomb Sight and the 12,000 lb Tallboy bomb, No. 617 {{achieved}} a <b>bombing</b> <b>error</b> of only 94 yards at the V Weapon launch site at Abbeville. 5 Group staff also developed other various techniques, {{such as the}} '5 Group corkscrew' used to evade enemy fighters, and the 'quick landing system'.|$|R
50|$|Lincoln B.2 RF403 had two Pythons {{similarly}} installed and {{was used}} for high-altitude bombing trials at Woomera, South Australia. These trials were principally of the ballistic casings for the Blue Danube atomic weapon: the Lincoln was the only available aircraft that could accommodate the large weapon casing, measuring 62 inches diameter x 24 ft in length. The Pythons were fitted to increase the height from which tests could be carried out. Maximum release height and speed for the first eleven tests was 275 mph and 34,783 ft with a <b>bombing</b> <b>error</b> of 61 ft.|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} {{gained a}} reputation as {{being one of the}} leading RAF heavy bomber squadrons, winning the Lawrence Minot Memorial Bombing Trophy six times between 1927 and 1933 and shared in 1934 with 54 Squadron in 1934, achieving an average <b>bombing</b> <b>error</b> of 40 yards (37 m). By this time, the elderly Virginia was obsolete, and in April 1935 they were replaced by the more modern Handley Page Heyford, which it won the Lawrence Minot trophy yet again in 1935. Part of the squadron was split off in October 1935 to form No. 102 Squadron, while the remainder moved to RAF Finningley in September 1936. In April 1937 the squadron received four Vickers Wellesleys to equip a flight which was again split off to form 76 Squadron.|$|R
50|$|Peacetime {{practice}} {{involved the}} dropping of small practice bombs on instrumented bombing ranges, also {{a system of}} predicted bombing using radio tones to mark the position of bomb drop over non-range targets, the <b>bomb</b> <b>error</b> being calculated by a ground radar unit and passed either to the crew during flight or to a headquarters for analysis. Use of the Valiant's Navigational and Bombing System (NBS) and the high quality of assigned crews, which were typically veterans and often had been previously decorated for wartime service, {{a high level of}} bombing accuracy could be achieved, greater than that of aircraft during the Second World War. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, Valiant crews were able to place practice bombs from an altitude of 45,000 ft within a few meters of their assigned target.|$|R
50|$|On six of {{its first}} ten {{missions}} weather conditions were poor and no bombs were dropped. On 15 March the group {{was one of several}} which bombed Monte Cassino in support of Fifth Army operations. The second unit of the 456th dropped its <b>bombs</b> in <b>error</b> on Allied troops, for which the deputy group commander was removed.|$|R
40|$|The Visual Technology Research Simulator {{was used}} for a quasi-transfer-of-training study in which 32 {{military}} pilots were taught to deliver bombs from a 30 -deg dive. Scene content had a strong and consistent effect on performance and on differential transfer. A landscape scene that contained buildings, roads, and rectangular fields was better than a schematic grid pattem for both training and transfer. Scene variety in training did not benefit transfer, {{and there is a}} distinct possibility that it can interfere with early leaming. Augmented feed-back proved to be a potent instructional variable, but one that showed complex effects. It helped inexperienced pilots with their dive pitch control, and it helped the more experienced pilots with their longitudinal <b>bombing</b> <b>error.</b> The data presented here have strong implica-tions for design and use of flight training simulators in that they indicate the importance of scene content and augmented feedback as training variables...|$|R

40|$|The major {{features}} of a proposed approach to radar bomb scoring are discussed.

500|$|Experience in Vietnam {{demonstrated}} {{the need for}} a better visual and blind bombing capability. In March 1968, the Air Force ordered development of an upgraded bombing/navigation system, incorporating a Singer-General Precision inertial navigation system, improvements to the AN/APN-131 navigation radar, and solid-state circuitry for the R-14A radar, which was redesignated R-14K. Furthermore, the digital AN/ARN-92 long-range navigation receiver replaced the problematic AN/ARN-85 receiver. The additional avionics were housed in a long, raised dorsal spine. The modified bombing/navigation system was known as Thunderstick II. [...] F-105s with this system could achieve a <b>bombing</b> circular <b>error</b> of probability (CEP) of [...] from an altitude of [...] Although the first Thunderstick II aircraft flew in 1969, they were not used in Vietnam.

She also attacked the German barge F 184, but was forced to withdraw due to return fire.

500|$|Another {{minefield}} of 170 magnetic mines {{was laid}} by Eckoldt, Ihn and Steinbrinck {{on the night}} of 6/7 January 1940 off the Thames Estuary. The destroyer [...] and six merchant ships totalling 21,617 GRT were lost to this minefield as well and another ship was damaged as well.

The latter ship suffered tube failures in her boilers that reduced her maximum speed to [...] and she had to be escorted back to Germany by Beitzen. This minefield only claimed one fishing trawler of 251 tons. Eckoldt, Beitzen and Max Schultz laid 110 magnetic mines in the Shipwash area, off Harwich, on 9/10 February that sank six ships of 28,496 GRT and damaged another. Eckoldt was the flagship during Operation Wikinger, an attempt to capture British fishing trawlers operating off the Dogger Bank on 22 February, when two destroyers sank with heavy loss of life – one hit newly-laid British mines in a supposedly mine-free channel and the other was <b>bombed</b> in <b>error</b> by the Luftwaffe.|$|R
50|$|The unit {{received}} a Distinguished Unit Citation for an extremely hazardous mission against naval installations at Kiel on 14 May 1943: Its B-24's flew {{in the wake}} of the main formation and carried incendiaries to be dropped after three B-17 groups had released high explosive bombs, thus the group's aircraft were particularly vulnerable, lacking the protection of the firepower of the main force. This vulnerability increased when the group opened its own formation for the attack; but the 44th blanketed the target with incendiaries in spite of the concentrated flak and continuous interceptor attacks it encountered.Late in June 1943 a large detachment moved to North Africa to help facilitate the Allied invasion of Sicily by bombing airfields and marshalling yards in Italy.

40|$|One {{frequently}} encounters {{the need}} of a rational selection of sample size when it is desired to estimate the standard devia-tion. Changing the permissible rror of the estimate from an absolute to a relative one is acceptable in many cases and per-mits an exact, a priori {{solution to the problem}} of sample size without involving any previous estimates. T HERE ARE many practical engineering situations in which an esti-mate of the linear dispersion of a characteristic is desired. Examples of such are longitudinal or range error of a low-altitude <b>bomb</b> sight, or <b>errors</b> of a measuring device. Experience in working with the engineer has shown that 1) he grasps the idea of a standard eviation as a meas-ure of dispersion; 2) he accepts the concept of expressing a sample standard deviation as being within a previously agreed-upon percentage of its true value for the normal population; 3) he has enough intuitive understanding of a confidence coefficient o be willing to take actio...|$|R
