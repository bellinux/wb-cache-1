50|$|A {{lamp type}} like the Tizio works like this. A <b>balancing</b> <b>arm</b> (the forearm) has {{on one side}} of an axis a small {{counterweight}} {{and on the other side}} a lamp cap. These parts are lifted by a second bigger <b>balancing</b> <b>arm</b> (the upper arm) that has on the other side of a second axis a heavier counterweight. The lamp designed by Edouard-Wilfrid Buquet in 1929 works in this way. The lamp is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art.

40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{a method}} to {{measuring}} the magnitude of a uniform magnetic field in space using current balance was described. A simple experimental set was designed and constructed using low-cost materials. This constructed current balance consists of copper sheet, weight pan, and acrylic sheet. A copper sheet was cut into a U-shape and attached {{at the end of}} acrylic <b>balance</b> <b>arm.</b> A weight pan was hanged in {{the opposite side of the}} <b>balance</b> <b>arm</b> with high sensitivity to a small torque. The horizontal segment of the U-shaped copper sheet, which the length l was 3 cm, was located inside the influence of an uniform magnetic field produced by two parallel bar magnets with opposite poles facing each other. The magnetic field direction was perpendicular to the horizontal segment. When a current was supplied to the copper sheet, the magnetic force acting on a horizontal segment of length l carrying a current I in a magnetic field B was given by BlIFB In the experiment, the current was varied from 0 – 1 A. For each value of applied current, the magnetic force on a thin straight sheet of length l was measured by adding masses to the pan until the <b>balance</b> <b>arm</b> moved to the equilibrium between opposing gravitational and magnetic forces. The results showed that the magnetic force increased linearly with increasing applied current. By plotting a linear graph of magnetic force versus applied current, the magnetic field B can be calculated from l slope B. The calculated and actual values of B were 100. 32 and 100. 13 mT, respectively. This constructed current balance is an excellent tool for high school and undergraduate fundamental physics courses. Students will be excited when they see the <b>balance</b> <b>arm</b> rising or going down due to magnitude and direction of current flowing in a conductor wire...|$|R
40|$|Gravity <b>balancing</b> <b>arms</b> are passive weight support {{mechanisms}} {{that have been}} used to support human arms when weakened or otherwise in need of assistance. However, these systems could be greatly enhanced for everyday use if they can adapt for changing load mass or position. This thesis presents the development and preliminary testing of an adaptive system for gravity <b>balancing</b> <b>arm</b> devices that requires minimal user involvement and has low power and sensing requirements since it is built upon the system’s passive dynamics. It uses active control only to re-equilibrate the underlying passive system for changing conditions, then is turned off when not needed. Users can go about everyday tasks, and as a load mass or position for their task changes, they simply switch the system into an adaptation mode for either load mass or position, and the system takes care of the rest. The controller uses an indirect and low-power actuation method, adjusting the position of a key passive spring parameter (‘a’ value). The system requires only one sensor, an encoder, to measure the angle of the gravity <b>balancing</b> <b>arm,</b> which is used to indicate position of the gravity <b>balancing</b> <b>arm.</b> We use gain scheduling feedback control due to the nonlinearity of the gravity <b>balancing</b> <b>arm</b> system. Here, we primarily seek to demonstrate the feasibility of this novel system design. However, we also experimentally measure the adaptation response of the system for multiple load masses and two versions of the control gains (one for minimal damping to reduce energy cost, and one with increased damping effect to improve response times). We seek response times that are fast enough for the user to maintain task memory (2 - 4 seconds), but not significantly faster to keep power, weight, and actuator cost lower. We confirm that the system meets this objective by quantitatively measuring response times for each trial and providing a qualitative analysis of the system effectiveness based upon user-centered requirements from the field of user-interface design. Overall, we find that the system initiates physical adaptation changes fast enough to be perceived as continuous with the user’s task (less than 1 second), and can complete adaptation fast enough for users to maintain task memory (2 - 4 seconds) when load masses are less than 7. 5 lbs. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of the dynamic balance control of multi-arm {{free-floating}} space robot during capturing an active object in close proximity. The position and orientation of space base will be affected during the operation of space manipulator because of the dynamics coupling between the manipulator and space base. This dynamics coupling is unique characteristics of space robot system. Such a disturbance will produce a serious impact between the manipulator hand and the object. To ensure reliable and precise operation, we propose to develop a space robot system consisting of two arms, with one arm (mission arm) for accomplishing the capture mission, and the other one (<b>balance</b> <b>arm)</b> compensating for the disturbance of the base. We present the coordinated control concept for balance of the attitude of the base using the <b>balance</b> <b>arm.</b> The mission arm can move along the given trajectory to approach and capture the target with no considering the disturbance from the coupling of the base. We establish a relationship between the motion of two arm that can realize the zeros reaction to the base.
