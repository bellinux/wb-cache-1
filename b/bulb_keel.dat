50|$|A <b>bulb</b> <b>keel</b> is a keel, {{usually made}} with a high aspect ratio foil, that {{contains}} a ballast-filled bulb at the bottom, usually teardrop shaped. The purpose of the <b>bulb</b> <b>keel</b> is to place the ballast as low as possible, therefore gaining the maximum possible amount of leverage and thus the most righting moment. An example of a class of boats that use a <b>bulb</b> <b>keel</b> is the International 110 racing class, which uses a 300 lb (136 kg) cast iron <b>bulb</b> <b>keel</b> on a boat whose minimum racing weight is 910 lb (414 kg).|$|E

5000|$|Since <b>bulb</b> <b>keels</b> {{work best}} on long, thin keels or daggerboards, they are {{generally}} not used on sailboats intended for shallow waters, but are most often found on offshore racing craft. Daggerboards built like <b>bulb</b> <b>keels</b> are {{often referred to as}} [...] "lifting keels", and they can be retracted into the boat to reduce the draft, and to allow the boat to be loaded onto a trailer. Lifting keels {{are also more likely to}} be found on craft built for speed, as a winch or a set of pulleys is required to provide purchase to lift the heavy keel.|$|R

2500|$|The keel {{surface on}} the bottom of the hull gives the ship greater {{directional}} control and stability. In non-sailing hulls, the keel helps the hull to move forward, rather than slipping to the side. In traditional boat building, this is provided by the structural keel, which projects from the bottom of the hull along most or all of its length. In modern construction, the bar keel or flat-plate keel performs the same function. There are many types of fixed keels, including full keels, long keels, fin <b>keels,</b> winged <b>keels,</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>keels,</b> and bilge keels among other designs. Deep-draft ships will typically have a flat bottom and employ only bilge keels, both to aid directional control and to damp rolling motions ...|$|R

5000|$|The 110 is a long, narrow, {{double ended}} boat, {{resembling}} a sailing canoe. The cross-section from bow to stern is rectangular with 2" [...] radius corners, {{and the boat}} has a plumb bow and stern. The design's stability is provided by a 300 lb <b>bulb</b> <b>keel.</b> The 110 uses a fractional sloop rig, with an optional spinnker, and has the rudder mounted far forward of the stern. Originally built in plywood, modern 110s are built in fiberglass. Since there is a minimum hull weight, modern lightweight materials offer little advantage, and older wooden hulls can still be competitive. Crew is 2, although 3 can fit, one crew member can use a trapeze rig to place their weight further out while sailing upwind.|$|E
5000|$|Racing yachts try {{to reduce}} the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy <b>bulb</b> <b>keel,</b> {{allowing}} them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs {{tend to have a}} very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive heel angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35 knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are [...] "single handed" [...] races, where one person alone must control the yacht.|$|E

Searches considering all characters non-additive or some additive were also carried out. The preferred tree, obtained with implied weights, concavity 6 and all characters non-additive shows that Pterinopelma is a monophyletic genus sister to the clade Lasiodora (Vitalius + Nhandu).

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} four sailboat keels is presented. Three of the keels have bulbs of different shapes: an L-keel, a T-keel and an integrated <b>bulb</b> <b>keel.</b> These shapes are found on most sailing yachts designed {{during the past}} twenty years. The fourth keel is a standard fin keel. Lift and drag of the four keels have been measured in a wind tunnel {{and the results are}} compared. To obtain more practical results the measured data have been input into a VPP, and the performance of a 40 foot yacht equipped with the different keels is evaluated. Although the performance differences are not great, they are clearly of interest in yacht racing. Since one purpose of the experimental campaign was to develop a data base for CFD validation, emphasis is placed on uncertainty estimation. A numerical optimisation of the most common bulb, the integrated one, is also reported. A CFD code was linked to an optimiser and a CAD program, and the drag to lift ratio of the keel was minimized at an angle of attack of 4 °. The optimisation was preceded by a CFD code validation for the keel. It is shown in the paper that the proposed technique improves the performance such that the worst keel becomes competitive with the best non-optimised one...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was {{to carry out a}} {{preliminary}} design of a 50 - 60 ft modern cruiser/racer yacht with classic lines. This concept has increasingly become popular as the market has become over saturated with standard high volume cruisers. The main objective of the project was to set a definitive design brief from which a basis hull could be decided upon. Research was then carried out into similar concepts to see what problems are present and why. Many problems were identified including the tenderness of these yachts and therefore the need for a low centre of gravity and potentially greater beam. It was recognised stability could therefore pose problems to the project along with the lack of interior space that is present in a classic hull form. The aim was to analyse these problems and improve upon them {{through the use of a}} design spiral process; working to design a new concept which takes benefits from both classic and modern design. The yacht is to be a one-off production which is built using wood composite construction. Wood is lightweight, easy to work and is a natural sustainable material. Boats have been built from wood for centuries, and for that reason people have a respect for it and aesthetically it is very much appreciated. Together with the use of modern adhesives and fastenings it is possible to build a wooden structure lighter than a composite structure for the equivalent density. Furthermore with careful structural design it is possible to design a structure which is compliant to RCD category A assessment making it suitable for offshore racing/ cruising should the owner desire to do so. It is believed that the market is becoming more and more lucrative for modern/classic designs with the recent and on-going restoration of many of the J class yachts. Together with the performance qualities that are obtainable, sustainability and aesthetical quality there is a place for these yachts within the modern market place. Many people want to own their own wooden classic yacht – especially with the benefit of a modern high draft <b>bulb</b> <b>keel</b> and high modulus carbon/aramid laminate sails...|$|E

40|$|Yacht canting keel {{configurations}} {{have been}} developed to maximise the available righting moment by rotating their <b>keel</b> <b>bulb</b> to windward. Regulatory authorities have been required to establish rules covering the design and operation of such systems, however significant dynamic investigations into their behaviour have not been performed. This paper presents results from a theoretical and experimental investigation into the dynamic stability of canting keel sailing yachts when experiencing a knockdown by large breaking waves. Towing tank experiments were conducted on a yacht model with a fixed keel and two canted keel configurations, beam-on to large solitary breaking waves. The motion of the model during the tests was recorded by four video cameras and analysed using photogrammetry. A comparison of the hydrostatic predictions and experimental results indicate that the traditional GZ approach of assessing the energy required to heel may not be appropriate for yachts with canting keels. In addition a correlation of the experimental results with the ISO stability index highlights that this index may be unsuitable for categorising yachts with canting keels with respect to their ability to recover after a knockdown event...|$|R
40|$|The term “filler” {{does not}} define a {{specific}} product, but an entire class of composite materials used to fill surface imperfec- tions. Until recently the filler was used only {{to treat the}} surface imperfections. Currently, it has several aims like sanding, filling, levelling, protecting and insulating the substrate. In the marine field its main purposes are: insulate the surface, improve the surface finish and prepare it for the next painting treatments. The mechanical properties of fillers are fundamental to ensure {{the integrity of the}} painting systems which must be able to withstand the deformations suf- fered by the vessel. In fact the hull undergoes different stres- ses and deformations depending on the point where it is considered (<b>bulb,</b> rudder, <b>keel,</b> topsides or superstructure), the spe- cific condition to which it is subjected (stationary or sailing) or the material of construction (aluminium, steel, wood or glass-reinforced plastic). In the frame of the technological evolu- tion of materials, fillers underwent a remarkable development through the use of products such as epoxy resins that are, in modern formulations, very simple to use, differently from other ma- terials used in nautical field (polyester, vinylester and polyurethanes) and com- bine enhanced performance and versa- tility. Their mechanical, physical, electri- cal and thermal properties can be tailo- red with the addition of inert fillers like microfibers, phenolic microspheres, glass microspheres and colloidal silica. In particular, the glass microspheres are hollow spheres with diameters in the micrometer range. They generally improve the hardness of the surface. 2 ̆ 028 When they are mixed with epoxy resin produce a material extremely tenacious, slightly elastic and difficult to break. The phenolic microspheres are hollow spheres with diameters in the microme- ter range. They are very light and gene- rally improve the tenderness of the sur- face. The microspheres mixed with epoxy resin produce a material slightly hard, brittle, easy to work with abrasi- ves. For this reason the phenolic micro- spheres are used for the preparation of fillers particularly easy to be sanded but extremely waterproof. The microfibers are microscopic frag- ments of a material and are able to thic- ken the resin and, once hardened, to act as “reinforcement” of the resin itself. Then the mix of epoxy resins with micro- fibers produces a tenacious, elastic material hard to break. For this reason microfibers are used for the preparation of adhesives able to join the surfaces fil- ling all the gaps between them. The colloidal silica is a powder that has the property to make more dense the epoxy resin. It is used exclusively as a thic- kener in combination with other inert exten- ders to produce an high density filler. In this work the evaluation of the physi- cal and mechanical properties of various commercial fillers is presented. 2 ̆ 028 The morphological analysis of their structure is used to try to determine the influence of various components on their final properties...|$|R
