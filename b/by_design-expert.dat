This paper chose three significant factors affecting the traction coefficient：temperature, load and rotate speed. Test results showed that the traction coefficient under the high load is significantly higher than under low load from room temperature to 135 ℃. After more than 135 ℃, the traction coefficient under the low load is higher than under the high load.

Automated real-time cellular analysis as a rapid and non-invasive technology was used to monitor the growth of PC- 3 cells in 16 -well plates. At the same time, Plackett-Burman design was employed to identify the most influential formulation by integrating relevant information statistically. The effects of the 16 selected factors were evaluated during exponential cell growth and three medium constituents (EGF, FGF and linoleic acid) were identified to have significant effects on the cell growth. Subsequently, the response surface methodology with central composite design was applied to determine the interactions among the three factors so that these factors were optimized to improve cell growth. Finally, the prediction of the best combination was made under the maximal response to optimize cell growth <b>by</b> <b>Design-Expert</b> software 7. 0. A total of 20 experiments were conducted to construct a quadratic model and a second-order polynomial equation.

30|$|India consumes {{almost five}} times more diesel fuel than {{gasoline}} and burns about 450 million barrels a year of diesel [1]. So in India, search for alternatives is an important criterion to meet current and future energy requirements. India's tropical climate is ideal {{for the growth of}} algal species which serves as an advantage over other countries. Approximately 841 species of marine algae are found in both intertidal and deep water regions of the Indian coast [2]. Less than 100 species have been explored for biodiesel extraction. There are two global biorenewable liquid transportation fuels that might replace gasoline and diesel fuel in the future. These are bioethanol and biodiesel [3]. Biodiesel is a processed fuel derived from the esterification and transesterification of free fatty acids and triglycerides, respectively, that occur naturally in renewable biological sources such as plant oils and animal fats [4]. Different countries use the oil which is abundant in that particular country. India, being a peninsula, has a rich source of seaweeds. Algae are classified as microalgae and macroalgae. The potential value of microalgal fuel production is widely recognized [5]-[11]. Macroalgae, which are also known as seaweeds, have comparatively low lipid content. Nevertheless, they are a potential raw material for biofuel production. Biodiesel has good biodegradability, and it is expected to degrade over 98 % biologically within 3  weeks while commercial diesel will only degrade 50 % biologically within the same period [12]. In Indian waters, species of Sargassum are the most abundant algae [13]. The seaweeds detach themselves from the rocky substrates and are frequently washed ashore. Though details of the phytoprofile [2], antioxidant activity, free scavenger property [14], and fatty acid profile of Sargassum have been reported, optimization of biodiesel yield and storage properties have not been reported regarding its suitability as a raw material for biodiesel. Hence, this paper deals with the production of biodiesel from the brown seaweed Sargassum myriocystum as a potential resource for biodiesel. Algal oil extracted from the brown seaweed S. myriocystum was transesterified to biodiesel. Analysis of the biodiesel sample was done using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The GC-MS of the biodiesel sample indicated the presence of low amounts of unsaturated fatty acids [15]. Since the fatty acid profile predicted low concentration of unsaturated fatty acids, the biodiesel sample was tested for storage properties. Biodiesel production from algae is hindered by its production cost. This can be overcome by optimizing the reaction parameters to achieve maximum production of biodiesel with minimum cost of raw materials. For this research work, optimization of reaction conditions was done <b>by</b> <b>Design-Expert</b> software version 8.0. 7.1 (Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Central composite design (CCD) was applied to optimize the catalyzed transesterification reaction variables like oil:alcohol ratio, catalyst amount, time, and temperature. Regression analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tested the significance of the model. S. myriocystum is also rich in proteins and sugars. It is being used in food and pharmaceutical industries [16]. By applying the biorefinery concept, all valuable end products can be extracted from S. myriocystum, thus making the cost of algal biodiesel economically viable. This study will enable the seaweed to be considered as a potential option as a biorefinery crude.|$|E

40|$|Pravastatin is a {{clinically}} useful cholesterol-lowering agent, selectively inhibiting 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, {{the regulatory}} enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Currently, industrial production of this statin {{is based on}} a two-step fermentation process: the initial production of compactin and its subsequent biotransformation to pravastatin. The development of a one-step fermentation process using pravastatin-producing microfungi may be a commercially attractive approach. To facilitate this, isolation of novel fungal strains from different natural sources and their screening for pravastatin production is required. Soil being a reservoir {{for a wide variety of}} filamentous fungi has been recognized for a long time. In this study, 54 fungal cultures were obtained from soil samples collected in Pahang State (Malaysia). Isolates were cultivated in submerged fermentation and tested for their ability to produce pravastatin using high-performance liquid chromatography. Five selected pravastatin producers were identified to species level using cultural and morphological characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests, and molecular techniques. Screening of the important variables affecting pravastatin production by the best of these producers was initially carried out using 27 - 3 fractional factorial design and these selected variables were then optimized using rotatable central composite design. Kinetic studies of substrate uptake, fungal growth and pravastatin production in shake flask culture under optimized conditions were also conducted. Among 25 Penicillium isolates that were capable of producing pravastatin directly by fermentation, only five (ESF 2 M, ESF 19 M, ESF 20 P, ESF 21 P, and ESF 26 P) did so in relatively high concentrations, with Penicillium sp. ESF 21 P being the most active pravastatin producer, achieving a concentration of 196. 83 mg/L. Fungal identification methods used in this study confirmed that the isolates Penicillium sp. ESF 2 M and ESF 19 M are referable to Penicillium citrinum, Penicillium sp. ESF 20 P and ESF 26 P were most closely related to Penicillium janthinellum, and Penicillium sp.
