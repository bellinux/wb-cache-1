5|$|The {{ability of}} {{bacteria}} to degrade {{a variety of}} organic compounds is remarkable and {{has been used in}} waste processing and <b>bioremediation.</b> Bacteria capable of digesting the hydrocarbons in petroleum are often used to clean up oil spills. Fertiliser was added to some of the beaches in Prince William Sound in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. These efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil. Bacteria are also used for the <b>bioremediation</b> of industrial toxic wastes. In the chemical industry, bacteria are most important in the production of enantiomerically pure chemicals for use as pharmaceuticals or agrichemicals.|$|E
5|$|The Metropolitan Sewerage & Water Supply {{authority}} {{took over}} control of the pumping station from 1901 until 1910, when both the prison and town were connected to Perth's metropolitan water supply. The tunnels were closed in 1910, but the groundwater continued to be used for the prison's gardens. In 1989, oil leaking from nearby tanks contaminated the water. The pollution was eventually cleared by 1996 through <b>bioremediation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} {{plays an}} important role in the nitrogen cycle. Azotobacter also synthesizes some biologically active substances, including some phytohormones such as auxins, thereby stimulating plant growth. They also facilitate the mobility of heavy metals in the soil, thus enhancing <b>bioremediation</b> of soil from heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury and lead. Some kinds of Azotobacter can also biodegrade chlorine-containing aromatic compounds, such as 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, which was previously used as an insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide, but later was found to have mutagenic and carcinogenic effects.|$|E
5|$|Some organisms, {{such as the}} lichen Trapelia involuta or {{microorganisms}} such as {{the bacterium}} Citrobacter, can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times {{the level of their}} environment. Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in <b>bioremediation</b> to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.|$|E
5|$|In early 2008, Rosetta {{was used}} to {{computationally}} design a protein with a function never before observed in nature. This was inspired {{in part by the}} retraction of a high-profile paper from 2004 which originally described the computational design of a protein with improved enzymatic activity relative to its natural form. The 2008 research paper from David Baker's group describing how the protein was made, which cited Rosetta@home for the computing resources it made available, represented an important proof of concept for this protein design method. This type of protein design could have future applications in drug discovery, green chemistry, and <b>bioremediation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{has been}} shown to provide a {{protective}} effect against heavy metal toxicity when associated with the host Pinus sylvestris, preventing copper accumulation in the needles, and protecting seedlings against cadmium toxicity. Owing to its frequent rate of sexual reproduction and the resulting extensive gene flow within populations, the fungus can rapidly evolve a trait to tolerate otherwise toxic levels of heavy metals in the environment. The genetic basis of this adaptation—intriguing to researchers investigating the <b>bioremediation</b> potential of metal-adapted plants and their fungal associates—are contained in the genome sequence of S.luteus, published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|All {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods {{and would be}} harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified {{by a set of}} xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the <b>bioremediation</b> of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as organochloride compounds.|$|E
5|$|As a white-rot fungus, Panellus stipticus {{contains}} {{enzymes that}} {{are able to}} break down lignin, a complex aromatic polymer in wood that is highly resistant to degradation by conventional enzyme systems. The major enzyme that initiates the cleavage of hydrocarbon rings is laccase, which catalyzes the addition of a hydroxyl group to phenolic compounds (polyphenols). The ring can then be opened between the two adjacent carbon atoms that bear the hydroxyl groups. White-rot fungi are being investigated scientifically for their potential use in the <b>bioremediation</b> of land contaminated by organic pollutants, and to convert industrial wastes rich in toxic polyphenols. Panellus stipticus has been shown to reduce the phenolic concentration of waste water produced by olive-processing plants—an environmental concern in many Mediterranean countries. In this study, a liquid culture of P.stipticus mycelia reduced the initial concentration of phenolic compounds by 42% after a 31-day incubation period. In a separate study, a P.stipticus culture was able to effectively degrade the environmental pollutant 2,7-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a polychlorinated dioxin.|$|E
5|$|Panellus stipticus is one {{of several}} dozen species of fungi that are bioluminescent. Strains from eastern North America are {{typically}} bioluminescent, but those from the Pacific coast regions of North America and from other continents are not. The luminescence is localized to the edges of the gills and the junction of the gills with the stem and cap. Bioluminescence is also observable with mycelia grown in laboratory culture, and the growth conditions for optimal light production have been studied in detail. Several chemicals have been isolated and characterized that are believed to be responsible for light production. Genetic analysis has shown that luminescence is controlled by a single dominant allele. The luminescent glow of this and other fungi inspired the term foxfire, coined by early settlers in eastern and southern North America. Modern research has probed the potential of P.stipticus as a tool in <b>bioremediation,</b> because of its ability to detoxify various environmental pollutants.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{studies found}} that {{although}} the mushroom bioaccumulates mercury and cobalt from the soil, occasional consumption of mushrooms should not cause maximum allowable intake doses to be exceeded. Similar conclusions about safety were made in a Polish study of the mushroom's ability to accumulate organochlorine compounds. Different methods of preparation for consumption affect the leaching rate of cadmium, lead, and mercury. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, several studies showed I.badia bioaccumulates radioactive caesium, 137Cs. 137Cs is produced in nuclear power plants following the chain decay of 235U to 137Te, and has a half-life of thirty years. A German study showed that mushrooms collected from 1986 to 1988 had radiocaesium contents that were 8.3 to 13.6 times greater than mushrooms collected before the accident in 1985. This caesium-sequestering effect {{is caused by a}} brown pigment, the polyphenol compound norbadione A, which is related to a family of mushroom pigments known as pulvinic acids. Norbadione A has been investigated for its ability to provide a protective effect against the damaging effects of ionizing radiation. Tests with cell cultures and mice show that although it has some protective effect, it is toxic to cells in higher doses. A new series of alkali chelators based on the structure of norbadione A has been reported. The mushroom may have potential as a <b>bioremediation</b> agent to clean up contaminated sites.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bioremediation</b> – Protein ligand docking {{can also}} be used to predict {{pollutants}} that can be degraded by enzymes.|$|E
25|$|P. aeruginosa {{has been}} studied for use in <b>bioremediation</b> and use in {{processing}} polyethylene in municipal solid waste.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} {{of environmental problems}} through biological means is known as <b>bioremediation</b> and the specific use of plants for example by using phytoremediation. <b>Bioremediation</b> is sometimes {{used in conjunction with}} a pump and treat system. In <b>bioremediation,</b> either naturally occurring or specially bred bacteria are used to consume contaminants from extracted groundwater. This is sometimes referred to as a bio-gac system. Many times the groundwater is recycled to allow for continuously flowing water and enhanced bacteria population growth. Occasionally the bacteria can build up to such a point that they can affect filtration and pumping. The vessel should then be partially drained. Care must be taken to ensure that a sharp change in the groundwater chemistry does not kill the bacteria (such as a sudden change in pH).|$|E
25|$|Genetically {{modified}} {{plants have}} been used for <b>bioremediation</b> of contaminated soils. Mercury, selenium and organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).|$|E
25|$|Physical, chemical, and {{biological}} {{methods have been}} used to remediate arsenic contaminated water. <b>Bioremediation</b> is said to be cost effective and environmentally friendly <b>Bioremediation</b> of ground water contaminated with arsenic aims to convert arsenite, the toxic form of arsenic to humans, to arsenate. Arsenate (+5 oxidation state) is the dominant form of arsenic in surface water, while arsenite (+3 oxidation state) is the dominant form in hypoxic to anoxic environments. Arsenite is more soluble and mobile than arsenate. Many species of bacteria can transform arsenite to arsenate in anoxic conditions by using arsenite as an electron donor. This is a useful method in ground water remediation. Another <b>bioremediation</b> strategy is to use plants that accumulate arsenic in their tissues via phytoremediation but the disposal of contaminated plant material needs to be considered.|$|E
25|$|Deinococcus {{has been}} genetically {{engineered}} {{for use in}} <b>bioremediation</b> to consume and digest solvents and heavy metals, even in a highly radioactive site.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 {{a species}} of fungus, Geotrichum candidum, was found to consume the {{polycarbonate}} found in compact discs (CD). This has prospects for <b>bioremediation.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Bioremediation</b> Accelerator: Oleophilic, {{hydrophobic}} chemical, containing no bacteria, which chemically {{and physically}} bonds to both soluble and insoluble hydrocarbons. The <b>bioremediation</b> accelerator {{acts as a}} herding agent in water and on the surface, floating molecules {{to the surface of}} the water, including solubles such as phenols and BTEX, forming gel-like agglomerations. Undetectable levels of hydrocarbons can be obtained in produced water and manageable water columns. By overspraying sheen with <b>bioremediation</b> accelerator, sheen is eliminated within minutes. Whether applied on land or on water, the nutrient-rich emulsion creates a bloom of local, indigenous, pre-existing, hydrocarbon-consuming bacteria. Those specific bacteria break down the hydrocarbons into water and carbon dioxide, with EPA tests showing 98% of alkanes biodegraded in 28 days; and aromatics being biodegraded 200 times faster than in nature they also sometimes use the hydrofireboom to clean the oil up by taking it away from most of the oil and burning it.|$|E
25|$|Mycoremediation {{is a form}} of <b>bioremediation,</b> {{the process}} of using fungi to return an {{environment}} (usually soil) contaminated by pollutants to a less contaminated state.|$|E
25|$|This {{species has}} been {{investigated}} for application in <b>bioremediation.</b> The lignin-degrading enzyme laccase, isolated and purified from D. quercina, has shown use in biodegrading a variety of toxic dyes and pigments.|$|E
25|$|Innovative {{solutions}} {{have been}} conceived {{to deal with}} nutrient pollution in aquatic systems by altering or enhancing natural processes to shift nutrient effects away from detrimental ecological impacts. Nutrient remediation {{is a form of}} environmental remediation, but concerns only biologically active nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. “Remediation” refers to the removal of pollution or contaminants, generally for the protection of human health. In environmental remediation nutrient removal technologies include biofiltration, which uses living material to capture and biologically degrade pollutants. Examples include green belts, riparian areas, natural and constructed wetlands, and treatment ponds. These areas most commonly capture anthropogenic discharges such as wastewater, stormwater runoff, or sewage treatment, for land reclamation after mining, refinery activity, or land development. Biofiltration utilizes biological assimilation to capture, absorb, and eventually incorporate the pollutants (including nutrients) into living tissue. Another form of nutrient removal is <b>bioremediation,</b> which uses microorganisms to remove pollutants. <b>Bioremediation</b> can occur on its own as natural attenuation or intrinsic <b>bioremediation</b> or can be encouraged by the addition of fertilizers, called biostimulation.|$|E
25|$|The Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board, the Public Works Department and {{the local}} bodies are {{executing}} <b>Bioremediation</b> of Kodaikanal Lake under the National Lake Conservation Programme, with an expenditure of Rs.33.90 lakhs incurred till 2007.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Patricia Johanson was {{commissioned}} to redesign {{and restore the}} badly degraded lagoon. Since reopening in 1986, the redesigned lagoon has become recognized as a major earth sculpture {{and one of the}} earliest examples of art as <b>bioremediation.</b>|$|E
25|$|If ballast {{is badly}} fouled, the {{clogging}} will reduce {{its ability to}} drain properly; this, in turn, causes more debris to be sucked up from the sub-ballast, causing more fouling. Therefore, keeping the ballast clean is essential. <b>Bioremediation</b> {{can be used to}} clean ballast.|$|E
25|$|In an {{experiment}} conducted {{in conjunction with}} Batelle, a major contributor in the <b>bioremediation</b> industry, a plot of soil contaminated with diesel oil was inoculated with mycelia of oyster mushrooms; traditional <b>bioremediation</b> techniques (bacteria) were used on control plots. After four weeks, more than 95% {{of many of the}} PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) had been reduced to non-toxic components in the mycelial-inoculated plots. It appears that the natural microbial community participates with the fungi to break down contaminants into carbon dioxide and water. Wood-degrading fungi are particularly effective in breaking down aromatic pollutants (toxic components of petroleum), as well as chlorinated compounds (certain persistent pesticides; Battelle, 2000). Hair mats inoculated with oyster mushrooms were successfully employed in the clean-up of the San Francisco Bay area oil spill in 2007.|$|E
25|$|GM crops grown today, {{or under}} development, have been {{modified}} with various traits. These traits include improved shelf life, disease resistance, stress resistance, herbicide resistance, pest resistance, production of useful goods such as biofuel or drugs, {{and ability to}} absorb toxins and for use in <b>bioremediation</b> of pollution.|$|E
25|$|For example, one {{application}} of biotechnology is the directed use of organisms for {{the manufacture of}} organic products (examples include beer and milk products). Another example is using naturally present bacteria by the mining industry in bioleaching. Biotechnology {{is also used to}} recycle, treat waste, clean up sites contaminated by industrial activities (<b>bioremediation),</b> and also to produce biological weapons.|$|E
25|$|In {{geologic}} formations {{that allow}} delivery of hydrocarbon mitigation agents or specialty surfactants, this approach provides a cost effective and permanent solution to sites {{that have been}} previously unsuccessful utilizing other remedial approaches. This technology is also successful when utilized as the initial step in a multi faceted remedial approach utilizing SEAR then In situ Oxidation, <b>bioremediation</b> enhancement or soil vapor extraction (SVE).|$|E
25|$|That {{nanoparticles}} {{are highly}} reactive can {{mean that they}} rapidly clump together or react with soil particles or other material in the environment, limiting their dispersal to target contaminants. Some of the important challenges currently limiting nanoremediation technologies include identifying coatings or other formulations that increase dispersal of the nanoparticle agents to better reach target contaminants while limiting any potential toxicity to <b>bioremediation</b> agents, wildlife, or people.|$|E
25|$|Many {{varieties}} of transgenic tobacco have been intensively tested in field trials. Agronomic traits such as resistance to pathogens (viruses, {{particularly to the}} tobacco mosaic virus (TMV); fungi; bacteria and nematodes); weed management via herbicide tolerance; resistance against insect pests; resistance to drought and cold; and production of useful products such as pharmaceuticals; and use of GM plants for <b>bioremediation,</b> have all been tested in over 400 field trials using tobacco.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{countermeasures}} to long-lived fallout contamination exist {{with the}} most visible being the skimming off of a layer of topsoil, a decontamination practice that was fielded upon the creation of Lake Chagan. Moreover use of the open access radioecology research on decontamination and conventional agriculture in the Chernobyl-Polesie State Radioecological Reserve and around the Fukushima accident, would both be implemented {{in the event of}} any widespread contamination events, with particular emphasis on <b>bioremediation</b> of radionuclides from soil and aquifers.|$|E
25|$|Considered a very {{versatile}} {{host for}} the production of heterologous proteins, researchers can introduce genes into the microbes using plasmids, allowing for the mass production of proteins in industrial fermentation processes. Genetic systems have also been developed which allow the production of recombinant proteins using E. coli. One of the first useful applications of recombinant DNA technology was the manipulation of E. coli to produce human insulin. Modified E. coli have been used in vaccine development, <b>bioremediation,</b> and production of immobilised enzymes.|$|E
25|$|The {{environment}} {{can be affected}} by biotechnologies, both positively and adversely. Vallero and others {{have argued that the}} difference between beneficial biotechnology (e.g. <b>bioremediation</b> to clean up an oil spill or hazard chemical leak) versus the adverse effects stemming from biotechnological enterprises (e.g. flow of genetic material from transgenic organisms into wild strains) can be seen as applications and implications, respectively. Cleaning up environmental wastes is an example of an application of environmental biotechnology; whereas loss of biodiversity or loss of containment of a harmful microbe are examples of environmental implications of biotechnology.|$|E
25|$|Surfactants are {{in demand}} {{for a wide range}} of {{industrial}} applications as they increase solubility, foaming capacity and lower surface tensions. In particular, rhamnolipids have been used broadly in the cosmetic industry for products such as moisturisers, condom lubricant and shampoo. Rhamnolipids are efficacious in <b>bioremediation</b> of organic and heavy metal polluted sites. They also facilitate degradation of waste hydrocarbons such as crude oil and vegetable oil by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The rhamnolipid surfactant itself is valuable in the cosmetic industry, and rhamnolipids are a source of rhamnose, which is an expensive sugar in itself.|$|E
25|$|Nutrient bioextraction is <b>bioremediation</b> {{involving}} cultured {{plants and}} animals. Nutrient bioextraction or bioharvesting is {{the practice of}} farming and harvesting shellfish and seaweed {{for the purpose of}} removing nitrogen and other nutrients from natural water bodies. It has been suggested that nitrogen removal by oyster reefs could generate net benefits for sources facing nitrogen emission restrictions, similar to other nutrient trading scenarios. Specifically, if oysters maintain nitrogen levels in estuaries below thresholds that would lead to the imposition of emission limits, oysters effectively save the sources the compliance costs they otherwise would incur. Several studies have shown that oysters and mussels have the capacity to dramatically impact nitrogen levels in estuaries. Additionally, studies have demonstrated seaweed's potential to improve nitrogen levels.|$|E
25|$|An {{integrated}} aquaculture system {{consists of}} a number of species at different trophic levels of the food chain. Thus waste generating (fed organisms) such as fish and shrimp are coupled with extractive organisms such as abalone, sponges or sea urchins, as a mechanism of removing excess nutrient matter from the water column. Sea sponges have a distinct advantage as an extractive organism in an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture system, as they have the potential of acting as a bioremediator to remove both pathogenic bacteria and organic matter. The sponge Hymeniacidon perlevis has exhibited an excellent ability to remove total organic carbon (TOC) from seawater under integrated aquaculture conditions, and could be a potentially useful <b>bioremediation</b> tool for aquaculture systems in regions where water pollution is high. Furthermore, the organic enrichment originating from fish farmed in the vicinity may stimulate sponge growth, resulting in more efficient sea sponge aquaculture.|$|E
