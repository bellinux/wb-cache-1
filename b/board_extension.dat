40|$|A {{new digital}} {{technology}} to implement beam control systems was {{tested in the}} PS Booster in 2004 and 2005 and commissioned in LEIR in 2006. The technology is based upon RF custom hardware that heavily exploits Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) processing power. This architecture is extremely flexible in that it relies on a DSP-carrier board hosting one DSP and carrying different daughtercards. The LEIR beam control system deploys three DSP-carrier boards, which inter-communicate and exchange data continuously {{for the implementation of}} the various beam control loops. This user's manual for the DSP-carrier board, release 1. 0 (EDA- 00990 -V 1), was written in 2004 and has been used by CERN and BNL developers since then. It describes the DSP-carrier board hardware, user settings and FPGA software; hints on the DSP code used with the board are also given. An additional VME board, called Rear Transition Module, is described because it acts as a DSP-carrier <b>board</b> <b>extension...</b>|$|E
40|$|Quality of General Game Playing (GGP) matches {{suffers from}} slow state-switching and weak {{knowledge}} modules. Instantiation and Propositional Networks offer great performance gains over Prolog-based reasoning, {{but do not}} scale well. In this publication mGDL, a variant of GDL stripped of function constants, {{has been defined as}} a basis for simple reasoning machines. mGDL allows to easily map rules to C++ functions. 253 out of 270 tested GDL rule sheets conformed to mGDL without any modifications; the rest required minor changes. A revised (m) GDL to C++ translation scheme has been reevaluated; it brought gains ranging from 28 % to 7300 % over YAP Prolog, managing to compile even demanding rule sheets under few seconds. For strengthening game knowledge, spatial features inspired by similar successful techniques from computer Go have been proposed. For they required an Euclidean metric, a small <b>board</b> <b>extension</b> to GDL has been defined through a set of ground atomic sentences. An SGA-based genetic algorithm has been designed for tweaking game parameters and conducting self-plays, so the features could be mined from meaningful game records. The approach has been tested on a small cluster, giving performance gains up to 20 % more wins against the baseline UCT player. Implementations of proposed ideas constitutes the core of GGP Spatium - a small C++/Python GGP framework, created for developing compact GGP Players and problem solvers...|$|E
40|$|In 1992 / 93 the New Zealand wool {{industry}} {{was based on}} approximately 52. 5 million sheep that produced 255500 tonnes of greasy wool. The New Zealand Wool Board Grower Services Group, among others, provided the 24000 sheep farmers involved in wool production with management advice and technical assistance in growing and harvesting wool which was subsequently sold, exported, processed and promoted by a network of {{wool industry}} participants. The {{purpose of this study}} was to : • compile a detailed database of Wairarapa/Tararua wool production systems. • compare the database compiled with existing databases to test their suitability for describing Wairarapa/Tararua wool production systems. • identify management variable that may be important in achieving high levels of wool production and returns. • identify methods to improve New Zealand Wool <b>Board</b> <b>extension</b> in the Wairarapa/Tararua region. This was achieved by a combined mail and personal interview survey of a stratified random sample of 75 Wairarapa/Tararua wool producers. Descriptive statistical methods were used to describe the physical and financial characteristics of wool production systems and the management systems employed. Multiple regression analysis was used to estimate the relative importance of different management strategies and farm physical characteristics on wool production and clean wool price. Few significant differences in mean wool production system performance within farm class, summer rainfall, sheep flock size and summer rainfall/farm class groupings were noted in the study. Thus, the Wairarapa/Tararua region was relatively homogeneous in terms of wool production system performance over the past three seasons. A large range in values for most wool performance parameters suggested that wool production system performance on individual farms was influenced more by management variables than by farm physical attributes. A comparison of the New Zealand Meat and Wool Boards' Economic Service (NZMWBES) Sheep and Beef Farm Survey and Wairarapa Farm Improvement Club (WFIC) databases with data collected in this study indicated that NZMWBES and WFIC data were satisfactory for describing some, but not all of the characteristics of wool production systems in the region. Therefore, in order to maintain a representative overview of Wairarapa/Tararua wool production systems it is recommended that this study should be regularly updated. Aspects of wool production systems that could be improved on many Wairarapa/Tararua sheep farms mainly related to : the quantification of sheep breeding objectives; use of objective criteria for replacement ewe hogget and ram selection; improved summer feeding of mixed age ewes {if wool prices improve); and improved marketing {objective measurement and offer of wool to a wider range of buyers) of privately sold wool. These aspects can be addressed by New Zealand Wool Board mass extension activities, primarily through newspapers and free publications. While improvements in management for wool production are likely to increase monetary returns to the regions' wool producers, they should be promoted in the context of assisting individual wool producers to achieve their personal goals/objectives...|$|E

The <b>extension</b> <b>board</b> is based on a 32 -bit ARM 9 microprocessor and provides wireless network support. The ARM 9 <b>extension</b> <b>board</b> runs in parallel with the dsPIC microprocessor on the e-puck motherboard with communication between the two via an SPI bus.

50|$|Following {{the death}} of Selina Forth in 1911, the {{beneficiaries}} of her will sold Chippendale to Pauline Emma Eschenhagen in 1913. Pauline Eschenhagen, together with her husband Carl, and later her son Edward, ran a very successful restaurant and catering business {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century. Anti-German sentiment during World War I forced the sale of the business in 1915, and Ms Eschenhagen mortgaged Chippendale and had the architect of the original house, GMH Addison, design the large <b>boarding</b> house <b>extension</b> to the rear of the property. It is thought the front northern addition to the house was also completed at this time. In 1915 the property was leased to Grace Tate who ran the property as a boarding house. Ms Tate held a lease on Chippendale, including the <b>boarding</b> house <b>extension,</b> at least until 1929. In the same year, the <b>boarding</b> house <b>extensions</b> were added. Ms Eschenhagen also had architect Thomas Ramsay Hall design a new villa residence further along Gregory Terrace next to St Joseph's College, and lived in this house with her family until her death in 1921.|$|R

40|$|The MegaWatch project {{goal was}} to design and build a {{wireless}} network platform composed of 25 prototype hardware units to experiment with self-organized, infrastructureless ad-hoc networks. Requirements included reconfigurable, autonomous, low power consumption, and power measurement capability. In the long term, it is intended that all the above functionality be integrated in a small, watch size component. The design chosen was composed of five main blocks: two radio links, a power supply, <b>extension</b> <b>board,</b> and processing unit. An off-the-shelf, XE- 1202 digital radio circuit from Xemics was selected as one radio link for low-power, short distance communications.
