40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{integrated}} model for pricing airline tickets {{that takes into}} account the perceived value of multiple services associated with a given flight.

These elements of perceived values are not, to our knowledge, modeled in existing yield management systems. Our integrated model includes a classical aggregate planner for services as well as a share of choice.

It focuses on the factors influencing airline choice for a sample of 60 Taiwanese students based at UK Universities and traveling on five airlines: British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, China Airlines, EVA Airways, and Royal Dutch Airways. Several stages of data gathering were undertaken and a well?established analytical framework for services marketing was used to identify gaps between the desired and received service.

2500|$|After emigrating to Canada {{and setting}} up Zenair to sell plans and kits for amateur {{construction}} of his Zenith two-seat-light aircraft, the German aircraft designer Chris Heintz started design of a smaller, single-seat development of the Zenith, the Mono-Zenith.

40|$|Traveling {{within the}} United States is {{extremely}} costly. Low-cost airlines such as Southwest Airlines do exist {{but they do}} not provide the prices and efficiency that Ryanair, a United Kingdom based airline, does. Traveling throughout Europe is cheap and easy, jet setting to an Italian villa, when one lives in the middle of London would be considered completely normal. The United States is an enormous country, and unfortunately airline companies and airports do not provide easy, cheap methods of flying around the country. As a student or middle-class citizen, travel throughout the United States should be accessible and viable. If airline companies could lower their prices, or create competition amongst low-cost carriers, U. S. citizens would be able to travel more frequently. Traveling is essential to the prosperity, well-being, and overall knowledge of any individual. In addition, it would eliminate the stigma that comes with being an American, of being unworldly and uneducated. According to the World Economic Forum’s (W. E. F.) Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report, “{Travel} also has significant social and cultural benefits because of its potential to promote understanding and international relationships. These socioeconomic dimensions make tourism a vital component of globalization. ” According to the Social Identity Theory, “a person has not one ‘personal self,” but rather several selves that correspond to widening circles of group membership. Different social contexts may trigger an individual to think, feel, and act on basis of his personal, family, or national ‘level of self. ’” Which means that different people are directly affected by their surroundings whether it is people or places. It is extremely important to travel and explore different surroundings in order to improve oneself. Travel boosts the economy and creates awareness, “As the global economy enters deeper into a climate of uncertainty in 2009 with reduced investment and declining consumer spending, coupled with an increasing focus on fiscal policy to stimulate economic activity, it becomes more important than ever for countries to sustain and maximize the benefits of tourism,” according to W. E. F. Companies such as Ryanair and EasyJet, who have created airlines that follow the Southwest Airlines Low Cost Leadership model, have made travel within the United Kingdom easy and user-friendly. Through eliminating “free” services such as snacks and drinks, minimizing <b>baggage</b> <b>allowances,</b> removing seat assignments, allowing for quick flight turnarounds, choosing airports with lower terminal fees, advertising within the airplane, and using one standard jet for all flights, airlines can lower their costs and increase travel within the United States...|$|R
