50|$|The tufted {{capuchin}} (Sapajus apella), {{also known}} as brown capuchin, <b>black-capped</b> <b>capuchin,</b> or pin monkey is a New World primate from South America. As traditionally defined, {{it is one of}} the most widespread primates in the Neotropics, but it has recently been recommended considering the black-striped, black and golden-bellied capuchins as separate species in a new genus, thereby effectively limiting the tufted capuchin to the Amazon basin and nearby regions.|$|E
50|$|Some 150 {{northern}} muriquis (Brachyteles arachnoids) {{live today}} at the Fazenda Montes Claros, near Caratinga. It {{is one of their}} last refuges. The muriqui is the largest monkey of the Americas {{and one of the most}} endangered primates of the world. Specialists cite the biological importance of the Fazenda Montes Claros, where three other primate species live along with the muriqui: the buffy headed marmoset, the <b>black-capped</b> <b>capuchin</b> and the brown howler monkey.|$|E
25|$|The Lesser Primates {{exhibit is}} home to lemurs and monkeys {{including}} black-and-white ruffed lemurs, <b>black-capped</b> <b>capuchins,</b> Bolivian squirrel monkeys, common marmosets, cotton-top tamarins, emperor tamarins, pygmy marmosets and ring-tailed lemurs.|$|R

50|$|Rainforest Walkway — {{contains}} South American, Asian, and African Primates including <b>black-capped</b> <b>capuchins</b> and cottontop tamarins, Asian siamangs, and two lemur species; ring-tailed lemurs and ruffed lemurs. Other species include agoutis and red pandas.|$|R
40|$|Leptospirosis is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} zoonosis that affects domestic and wild animals, and that has the man as the end point of its epidemiological chain. Leptospirosis diagnosis in primates is more difficult than in other animal species, as clinical signs and lesions are less evident and antibody response is detected only for short periods. The aim {{of this article was}} to describe the detection of Leptospira spp using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in clinical samples from one captive <b>black-capped</b> <b>Capuchin</b> monkey (Cebus apella), which presented characteristics compatible with leptospirosis (jaundice and haemorrhagic kdney) in the macroscopic post-mortem examination. A friable kidney fragment and urine sample were cultured and submitted to experimental inoculation in guinea pigs and PCR using genus specific primer pair targeting the 16 S rRNA region from Leptospira interrogans serovar canicola. Isolation of the agent was negative both in culture and experimental inoculation. The PCR amplification of the clinical samples showed a 330 pb amplified fragment that corresponds to the Leptospira genus. Based on these results PCR was considered an important tool for leptospira detection in nonhumam primates, more sensitive and specific than other techniques, especially considering that the viability of the pathogen was not possible. These advantages enable the detection of the leptospiras in urine and kidney, even when autolysed, frozen or badly conserved, which prevented the isolation and experimental inoculation from positive results...|$|E
40|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} of primates have been extensively investigated, but key issues remain unresolved. Complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) data have many advantages in phylogenetic analyses, but such {{data are available}} for only 46 primate species. In this work, we determined the complete mitogenome sequence of the <b>black-capped</b> <b>capuchin</b> (Cebus apella). The genome was 16, 538 bp in size and consisted of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNAs, two rRNAs and a control region. The genome organization, nucleotide composition and codon usage {{did not differ significantly}} from those of other primates. The control region contained several distinct repeat motifs, including a putative termination-associated sequence (TAS) and several conserved sequence blocks (CSB-F, E, D, C, B and 1). Among the protein-coding genes, the COII gene had lower nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions rates while the ATP 8 and ND 4 genes had higher rates. A phylogenetic analysis using Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods and the complete mitogenome data for platyrrhine species confirmed the basal position of the Callicebinae and the sister relationship between Atelinae and Cebidae, as well as the sister relationship between Aotinae (Aotus) and Cebinae (Cebus/Saimiri) in Cebidae. These conclusions agreed with the most recent molecular phylogenetic investigations on primates. This work provides a framework for the use of complete mitogenome information in phylogenetic analyses of the Platyrrhini and primates in general...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the presence of zoo visitors may be stressful for various primate species, and visual contact with visitors may be the sensory stimuli that mediate visitor effects. We studied a group of <b>black-capped</b> <b>capuchins,</b> Cebus apella, in a controlled experiment, randomly imposing two treatments: customised one-way vision screens on the exhibit viewing windows to reduce visual contact with visitors; and unmodified viewing windows that allow full visual contact with visitors. We sampled capuchin behaviour including intra-group aggression and other social interactions, vigilance and abnormal behaviours. To provide a measure of physiological stress, we also analysed capuchin faecal samples for glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentration. When the view of visitors was obscured, we found marked reductions in capuchin aggression (from 14. 5 bouts to 4. 6 bouts per weekend, P= 0. 004) and FGM concentration (from 620 to 410. ng/g, P= 0. 008) among all adults, as well as reductions in abnormal behaviour (P = 0. 01) in two individuals. The capuchins also avoided the visitor viewing area (P = 0. 003) in the unmodified viewing window treatment. These results suggest that reducing the capuchins 2 ̆ 7 ability to view visitors improved their welfare. However we also found a {{reduction in the number of}} visitors when visual contact was reduced (from an average of 23 visitors per scan to 15, P = 0. 008), suggesting that the visitor experience may have been compromised by the lack of interaction with the capuchins. These results highlight a possible dilemma for the zoo industry between enhancing animal welfare in primates and providing for visitor experience...|$|R
