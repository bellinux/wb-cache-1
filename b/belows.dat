In 1513, the alley was then named after Gunilla Johansdotter Bese (1473-1553), wife of Erik Turesson Bielke (-1511) and mother to the grandfather of Queen Gunilla Bielke (1568-1597), and in 1674 the alley was even referred to as Sancta Gunillas gränd ("Alley of St Gunilla").|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} the nanosecond pulsed laser ablation of aluminum, a novel model was presented for the target ablation and plume expansion. The simulation of the target ablation was based on one-dimensional heat conduction, taking into account temperature dependent material properties, phase transition, dielectric transition and phase explosion. While the simulation of the plume expansion was based on one-dimensional gas-dynamical equation, taking into account ionization, plume absorption and shielding. By coupling the calculations of the target ablation and plume expansion, {{the characteristics of the}} target and plume were obtained. And the calculated results were in good agreement with the experimental data, in terms of ablation threshold and depth within the fluence range of the tested laser. Subsequently, investigations were carried out to analyze the mechanisms of nanosecond pulsed laser ablation. The calculated results showed that the maximum surface temperature remained at about 90 % of the critical temperature (0. 9 Tc) due to phase explosion. Moreover, the plume shielding has significant effects on the laser ablation, and the plume shielding proportion increase as the laser fluence increasing. The ambient pressure <b>belows</b> 100 Pa is more suitable for laser ablation, which can obtained larger ablation depth...|$|E

40|$|In 2002 and 2003, {{a rescue}} {{excavation}} {{along the route}} of the future motorway was carried out at Spodnje Škofije near Koper (Slovenia), at an archeological site named Križišče (2 ̆ 7 Crossroad 2 ̆ 7). Part of a Roman burial ground beside the Roman road (via Flavia Tergeste-Pola) was investigated. One of the cremation graves (no. 152) included an excellently preserved clay oil lamp with a representation of a glass furnace. The motif is the same as that on the only two other oil lamps depicting a glass furnace known so far - from Asseria (modern Benkovac, in Croatia) and Ferrara (in Italy). The new oil lamp has a disc decorated with a relief showing a glass furnace and to the left and right of it a glass-worker, one of whom is engaged in blowing while the other assists at the furnace. The representation is excellent and very well preserved, so that many details which are blurred in the other two lamps can be seen clearly. In the center is the furnace, divided into two sections. The lower one obviously serves as stoke holethe opening is hatched diagonally. The upper section of the furnace has a larger aperture, of semi-circular form. This was used for scooping molten glass out of the melting pot. Inside the reliefline surrounding the upper opening or door appears a V-shaped object turned upside down. Possibly this schematic sketch draws attention to the working port 2 ̆ 7 s small door or fireguard which closed the working port while work was in progress. On the left and right in the upper part two small shelves or working surfaces are shown. The right one can be interpreted as the working surface or slab on which the glass blower rolled a glass post. The right-hand figure sits on a low stool beside the furnace, dressed in a short tunic. He is barefoot, as can be seen by the shortslanting incisions at the front of his foot. On the floor lie three objects, which can probably be interpreted as raw glass or waste material formed during his work. The person 2 ̆ 7 s head is raised and ready to blow into the pipe which he holds inclined in front of him. This is elliptically broadened at the end and draws attention to the oblong, rather big object that the glass-worker is blowing. The blowpipe is less than a metre long and looks quite robust. We can also observe, that something is attached to the underside of the pipe. If the blowpipe is not made of metal, but of clay, the long narrow strip tied to it may have served to reinforce the pipe while the glassblower blew a large, heavy object. The figure {{on the left side of}} the furnace seems to be squatting next to the furnace. He has a short object in his hands, placed upright. Colud it be a 2 ̆ 7 pointed 2 ̆ 7 <b>belows</b> of the vertical type depicted on several Roman monuments depicting a smith at work? In that case, the strange, triangular shelf seen on the left side of the furnace probably represents the support for the <b>belows.</b> The oil lamp from the grave in Slovenia is by far the best preserved of all three lamps. Considering the composition and modest extent of the grave goods, this grave can be placed in the second half of the 1 st century or perhaps also at the beginning of the 2 nd century...|$|E
40|$|Ductile {{materials}} (like {{stainless steel}} or copper) show at cryogenic temperatures three principal phenomena: serrated yielding (discontinuous {{in terms of}} dsigma/depsilon), plastic strain-induced phase transformations and evolution of ductile damage. The present paper deals exclusively with the two latter cases. Thus, {{it is assumed that}} the plastic flow is perfectly smooth. Both in the case of damage evolution and for the gamma-alpha prime phase transformation, the principal mechanism is related to the formation of plastic strain fields. In the constitutive modeling of both phenomena, a crucial role is played by the accumulated plastic strain, expressed by the Odqvist parameter p. Following the general trends, both in the literature concerning the phase transformation and the ductile damage, it is assumed that the rate of transformation and the rate of damage are proportional to the accumulated plastic strain rate. The gamma-alpha prime phase transformation converts the initially homogenous material to a two-phase heterogeneous "composite ". The kinetics of phase transformation is described by the relevant linearized law of evolution of the volume fraction of alpha prime martensite in the austenitic gamma matrix left bracket Garion, C. and Skoczen, B. (2002 a). The evolution of orthotropic damage is characterized {{by the fact that the}} principal directions of damage are generally not colinear with the principal directions of stress. The damage rate tensor depends linearly on the strain energy density release rate tensor (conjugate force) and on the material properties tensor C, that reflects the orthotropy level. The relevant kinetic law of damage evolution and the combined constitutive model, including phase transformation, are developed in the present paper. The model is particularly suitable to describe the evolution of highly localized damage fields in thin-walled shells, subjected at cryogenic temperatures to the loads far beyond the yield point. It has been applied to the prediction of the response of the <b>belows</b> expansion joints (corrugated thin-walled shells) designed for the interconnections of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN...|$|E
