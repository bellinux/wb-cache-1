5|$|Bigfin reef squids and {{the common}} octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were studied to resolve a century-long debate over whether {{cephalopods}} can hear. Unlike fishes, cephalopods do not possess air-filled swim bladders, which might amplify sound waves travelling in water. The results were published in 2009. It showed that bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations, an organ primarily used for maintaining spatial orientation. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. Bigfin reef squids have a slightly better hearing range of 400Hz to 1500Hz. Both hear <b>best</b> <b>at</b> a frequency of 600Hz. Relatively, their hearing is comparable to prawns and some other invertebrates but is less sensitive than that of most fishes.|$|E

Five players of this generation gained both prime individual and team awards in foreign top competitions or European club competitions: defenders Vincent Kompany and Jan Vertonghen, wingers Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne, and forward Kevin Mirallas.

While Bolt improved upon the 200 m time three months later, setting the still-standing World youth <b>best</b> <b>at</b> the 2003 Pan American Junior Championships.

North Americans dominated the event as Maurice Greene and Bruny Surin took first and second place respectively, with record runs of 9.80s and 9.84s, respectively. The British sprint team Chambers, Gardener, Campbell and Marlon Devonish performed well in the 4×100metres relay event as runners-up {{in a time of}} 37.73s behind the US team led by Greene. World record holder Maurice Greene was hitting his peak, winning three gold medals in Seville.

5|$|Military {{aircraft}} {{flying at}} night {{have often been}} painted black or other dark colors, applied to just the underside of some aircraft and to the entirety of others, {{in the hope of}} reducing the risk of being seen in enemy searchlights or by night fighters. However, aircraft camouflaged with black paint are actually darker than the night sky, making them more visible to observers not using searchlights. The undersides of Heinkel 111 night bombers were painted black. The De Havilland Mosquito was similarly initially painted black when used as a night fighter; matt black was found to be the <b>best</b> <b>at</b> reducing the aircraft's visibility against searchlights, but the aircraft's speed was reduced by 15mph (25kph) compared to glossy black, which, being smoother, produced less drag. Since, however, black camouflage made the planes conspicuous on moonlit nights and against cloud, a variation of a day camouflage scheme was eventually chosen.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have keen eyesight. Like other cephalopods, {{they can}} {{distinguish}} the polarisation of light. Colour vision appears to vary from species to species, for example being present in O. aegina but absent in O. vulgaris. Attached {{to the brain}} are two special organs called statocysts (sac-like structures containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs), that allow the octopus to sense the orientation of its body. They provide information on {{the position of the}} body relative to gravity and can detect angular acceleration. An autonomic response keeps the octopus's eyes oriented so that the pupil is always horizontal. Octopuses may also use the statocyst to hear sound. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz, and hears <b>best</b> <b>at</b> 600Hz.|$|E

5|$|Seydlitz was {{generally}} admired for the superb coup d'œil {{that allowed him}} to utilize the cavalry to its full potential. His 19th century biographer, K. A. Varnhagen von Ense, related that Seydlitz lived above all for the service, and promoted the training of his hussars before all else. According to Anton König, who wrote in 17801790, Seydlitz performed <b>best</b> <b>at</b> taverns and excelled in practical jokes: one would gather that Seydlitz was a drunkard, a rake, and a savage, but another of his biographers, Bernhard von Poten, cited conflicting descriptions offered by Seydlitz's contemporaries, particularly Warnery, as more accurate. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to support König's assertion, at least of Seydlitz's excesses: Seydlitz was no doubt dependent upon his tobacco and had been since his teenage years, although he smoked a pipe rather than using snuff, as many officers did; he was indeed reckless, as his career testified; he enjoyed the company of women; and Seydlitz indeed suffered from recurring illness.|$|E
5|$|The {{ethos of}} the {{aristocracy}} as exemplified in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin. The public schools subscribed {{to the belief}} that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying mens sana in corpore sano, a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the <b>best</b> <b>at</b> one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practising or training was considered tantamount to cheating. Those who practised a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of Boden Professor of Sanskrit at the University of Oxford {{was established in}} 1832 with money bequeathed to the university by Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Boden, a retired soldier {{in the service of}} the East India Company. He wished the university to establish a Sanskrit professorship to assist in the conversion of the people of British India to Christianity, and his bequest was also used to fund scholarships in Sanskrit at Oxford. The first two professors were elected by Oxford graduates, as the university's statutes provided: Horace Hayman Wilson won by a narrow majority in 1832, and the 1860 election was hotly contested, as the rivals each claimed to be <b>best</b> <b>at</b> fulfilling Boden's intentions and presented different views about the nature and purpose of Sanskrit scholarship. Reforms of Oxford implemented in 1882 removed all mention of Boden's original purpose from the statutes, removed the power to elect the professor from graduates, and gave the holder of the professorship a fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford.|$|E

5|$|The year 2005 signalled a {{fresh start}} for Bolt {{in the form of}} a new coach, Glen Mills, and a new {{attitude}} toward athletics.

Toshack then came to the wicket at 9/476 and was involved in an aggressive final wicket partnership of 33 with Johnston, scoring 19runs—his <b>best</b> <b>at</b> Test level to date—in just 18minutes, batting in a carefree and freewheeling manner, before falling lbw to Alec Bedser, ending Australia's innings on 509 with a 344-run lead.|$|E

He sprinted to the line with a finishing time of 27:36; an Eritrean record and the second fastest that year. In August that year, he significantly improved his 10,000m <b>best</b> <b>at</b> Memorial Van Damme; his time of 26:37.25 knocked almost thirty seconds off his previous mark, but he still finished behind the emerging Micah Kogo who ran the tenth fastest ever time.
