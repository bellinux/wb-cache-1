40|$|The {{impetus for}} this paper arose {{out of a}} concern for the future of {{acquisitions}} at the Merrill Library. The common denominator between all disciplines represented in a university environment, the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge, is embodied in the academic library. The quest for knowledge often begins in the library; and the results of scholarly investigations are deposited on its shelves. As the quantity of published information increases, the importance of library collections as a vital element in the university community becomes increasingly evident. In recent years, American academic library collections have suffered in the face of double-digit inflation. The Merrill Library is also experiencing this inflation-born atrophy of acquisitions. The purpose of the study is to examine the erosion of library purchasing power in terms of its effects upon library collections and the collection of the Merrill Library in particular. Central to this purpose {{is the way in which}} the Merrill Library has attempted to cope with the rising price of library materials. The data used for the basis of this study were derived from the published literature and from the reports of Utah State University and the Merrill Library. The Subject <b>Bibliography</b> <b>of</b> Current <b>Serials,</b> 1976, prepared by the Merrill Library provided the basic data for several sections dealing with serial publications...|$|R

40|$|This <b>bibliography</b> <b>of</b> anthropological <b>serials</b> in the University of Nebraska Libraries {{has been}} {{undertaken}} primarily for two reasons. The first {{follows from the}} incredibly diverse nature of the discipline itself, {{for the study of}} man and his origins has given rise to various methods of inquiry and interdisciplinary overlays. As Sol Tax has pointed out, the study of man appears to have no natural boundaries. It comes as little surprise, therefore, that the bibliography representing the published record of such a varied field of study should itself be extremely diffuse. Add to this natural diffusion the characteristic pattern of dispersed library holdings throughout various branch locations and in several stack areas within the main library, and the situation becomes all the more confusing. This bibliography represents an attempt to bring together a single listing <b>of</b> all <b>serial</b> titles within the UNL collections pertaining to one or another of the sub-fields of anthropology, with locational and holdings information for each title. It is hoped that the product of this undertaking will bring some semblance of order out of diversity and will serve to enhance access to the collections. The second reason for undertaking the project pertains to the relative strengh of retrospective holdings within the UNL libraries. Admittedly, the budget cuts of recent years have precluded any possibility of maintaining the collection at an adequate level. Nevertheless, the UNL collections reflect some thorough and systematic bibliographic spadework in years gone by, particularly for North American archaeology and ethnology. This bibliography will hopefully bring this fact more fully to light. Due to various problems of providing adequate access to library collections in the past, it is doubtful whether these rather extensive holdings are being utilized to a very full extent. The prospect of unearthing a 2 ̆ 2 good 2 ̆ 2, if not 2 ̆ 2 excellent 2 ̆ 2 collection, plus the hope that access to the materials might be enhanced, would each be adequate justification for undertaking this bibliographic project...|$|R
