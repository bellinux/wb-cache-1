25|$|Having done {{independent}} research in marine biology at Villefranche-sur-Mer, Bujor moved to Geneva for specialized courses in animal morphology, {{under the guidance}} of Karl Vogt. He had been impressed by Vogt's work and transformist outlook, and was enthusiastic about taking courses under Ernst Haeckel; but he also found life in Paris hardly affordable. Bujor was well-liked by Vogt, who made him part of his research team, and then also worked under Professor Wiederschein at the University of Fribourg; with Grigore Antipa, he began work on a vast project to study the Black Sea fauna, stocking up on specialized instruments. He also continued his engagement with socialism, and attended lectures by Georgi Plekhanov. He received a doctorate in natural sciences from the University of Geneva in 1891; the work described the larval stages of development in the <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey.</b> It {{was one of the first}} Romanian contributions to dynamic morphology, and also won Bujor the Rousseau Institute's Davey Prize.|$|E

40|$|The {{life cycle}} of {{lampreys}} consists of two distinct and divergently specialized phases. During the larval or ammocoete stage, the lamprey is relatively sedentary, remaining burrowed in the silt deposits of streams and rivers from which it derives its microphagous diet. After metamorphosis, several species enter a parasitic phase in either a marine, lacustrine, or large fluviatile environment where they feed voraciously, mainly on the blood and tissue of host fishes. However, the majority of lampreys do not feed at all after they complete the larval period and reach sexual maturity, 6 to 10 months after the onset of metamorphosis.

Anglers and estuary netsmen have taken these fish to over 20 lb (9 kg) in weight. In summer and autumn there is also a substantial run of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In May the Towy has a run of the rare and protected twaite shad (Alosa fallax) and allis shad (Alosa alosa).

5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species.

40|$|The first {{specimen}} of Ammocoetes branchialis that showed histologically any atrophic {{changes in the}} endostyle was taken on July 16. These changes proceeded relatively rapidly for about a month, after which the endostyle as such was no longer recognized. All specimens examined after August 15 showed in cross section the characteristic ductless follicles more or less completely formed. More gradual and minor {{changes in the way}} of further absorption of cell remnants and completion of the follicles continued at least until September 1. Two specimens taken from the creek on September 4, 1911. showed complete follicle formation with some stainable colloid (figures 14 and 15). There was still yellow granular pigment in the fibrous tissue between the follicles. In two specimens taken on October 14, 1909, the pigment was absent and the follicles were more closely set, larger, and contained homogenous colloid. In the twenty-four specimens of ammocoetes studied, there were variations in the time of the onset of metamorphosis. There may also be variations in the rate of progress of the changes in different specimens. There is no evidence that removal of the animals from their native environment to the laboratory either increases or decreases the rate of metamorphosis. Schneider states that he was unable to get specimens kept in the laboratory to undergo metamorphosis. Gage, however, has repeatedly observed the metamorphosis under laboratory conditions, and the six of our specimens kept in the laboratory‚Äîsome for forty days‚Äîremained in excellent condition and the metamorphosis proceeded as well as in those living in the creek. I know of no observations bearing on the question as to whether the metamorphosis may be hastened or delayed as it can be in tadpoles and other amphibia. It is probable, however, that physical conditions greatly influence the transformation. These observations as to the length of time from the inception to the completion of metamorphosis indicate that a month and probably longer is necessary for the lake and <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys</b> of Central New York. This is in agreement with the observations of Gage and of Muller on metamorphosis in general, but is at variance with the views of Bujor, who states that the process takes place within three to four days. The first endostylar changes are a gradual shrinkage in the whole organ with thickening of the capsule and septum and proliferation of the connective tissue in the periendostylar zone. The tongue anlage is developed in this thickening just dorsal to the endostyle and anterior to the gland orifice. The size of the chambers progressively decreases and with the thickening of the septum the halves of the endostyle are both absolutely and relatively more separated. All the five types of epithelia are affected, the first to show the change being type I, the four fan-shaped bundles of cuneiform cells of each half of the endostyle. These disappear totally quite early. The next type to show marked changes is type III, or the cells with yellow pigment granules. Here the change is progressive and these cell groups in different stages of atrophy may be traced through to the fully developed follicles. The epithelium of type V, or the endothelial-like lining of the parietal walls of the chambers, is piled up and extruded laterally as the chambers contract or shrink. These cells in different stages of atrophy may be followed until the metamorphosis is nearing completion. It is certain that the cells of types I, III, and V play no part {{in the formation of the}} ductless follicles. With types II and IV the question is not so easily settled as it is from one or the other or from both of these types that the permanent follicles arise. One can say definitely that type IV plays the major role, but whether the cells of type II after fusion with the basal group of type IV do not also share in the formation of the ventral follicle of the given chamber, I cannot decide, but from the evidence obtainable this seems probable. It is significant that the cells of type IV are continuous with, and indistinguishable from, the cells lining the orifice and are continued anteriorly in the deep pharyngeal groove and peripharyngeal grooves as well as posteriorally from the orifice in the small pharyngeal groove. As to the fate of this extraglandular epithelium of type IV I have no data save that with the closing of the orifice and the formation of the permanent branchial sac these grooves with their ciliated epithelium disappear and the whole sac comes to be lined with plain stratified epithelium. The fact that the cells of the pharyngeal grooves and the lining cells of the gland orifice are continuous with the cells of the endostyle from which the permanent thyroid follicles are formed is not without significance in relation to the development of the thyroid of the higher chordates. One or more very large follicles are formed from the lower portion of this orificial epithelium of type IV. Four ductless follicles are the maximum number that may be formed primarily in each half of the endostyle from the four areas of epithelium of type IV. From the specimens studied this maximum is frequently not obtained. Posterior to the orifice where four chambers exist, each corresponding to one half of an anterior chamber, but two follicles may be formed from each chamber, but in the coil these are proportionately increased, in cross section. Most of the detailed studies here recorded have been made on the part of the endostyle posterior to the coil where the simplest conditions exist. Here two follicles are ordinarily formed from each chamber. In cross sections the follicles are at first only long tubules whose cavities are the remnants of the original endostyle chambers, but when the metamorphosis is completed each of these primary tubules is cut up into several elongated closed sacs corresponding to the true ductless follicles of all higher chordates. New follicles also arise by budding from these primary ones, and this process is probably of normal occurrence at the metamorphosis...|$|R
40|$|Pacific lamprey is a {{culturally}} valuable species to indigenous people, and has significant ecological importance in freshwater and marine ecosystems. Over {{the past several}} decades, constrictions in range and reductions in Pacific lamprey abundance have been observed in Western North America, and may be indicators of range-wide declines. In the face of declining populations, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service has partnered with tribal, state, federal, and local entities to implement a regional Pacific lamprey conservation agreement aimed at reducing threats to Pacific lamprey and improving their habitats and population status. Research needs identified in the conservation agreement include assessing larval Pacific lamprey occupancy and distribution, habitat requirements, and the limiting factors of larval distribution in the freshwater ecosystem. As {{part of the effort}} to address these knowledge gaps, we investigated the potential for larval lampreys to occur in tidally-influenced estuarine environments. Research of this type may be valuable for future conservation, management or recovery efforts of Pacific lamprey throughout its range. We employed a two-phased approach, consisting of laboratory and field components to address our aims. We first conducted a series of controlled laboratory experiments to evaluate osmotic stress tolerance and osmoregulatory status of larval Pacific lamprey exposed to a range of (1) fixed salinity in various dilutions of saltwater and (2) oscillating salinity treatments designed to simulate tidal activity. Tolerance was assessed by monitoring and comparing survival of larvae in various treatments through 96 h. Osmoregulatory status was assessed by quantifying and comparing total body water content, plasma osmolality, and plasma cation (i. e., sodium) concentrations among larvae surviving various treatments. In fixed salinity experiments, 100 % survival was observed in 0 ‚Ä∞, 6 ‚Ä∞, 8 ‚Ä∞ and 10 ‚Ä∞ through 96 h, while 0 % survival was observed through 48 h in 12 ‚Ä∞, 30 h in 15 ‚Ä∞, and 12 h in 25 ‚Ä∞ and 35 ‚Ä∞. In oscillating salinity experiments, on the other hand, a significant increase in survival (100 %) was observed through 96 h in treatments that oscillated between 12 ‚Ä∞ and 0 ‚Ä∞ (freshwater) at about 6 h intervals versus fixed 12 ‚Ä∞ salinity experiments. A significant increase in survival also occurred in oscillating 15 ‚Ä∞ treatments (60 %) versus fixed 15 ‚Ä∞ through 96 h. Linear regression analysis indicated higher environmental salinity in laboratory experiments was significantly related to increases in plasma osmolality and plasma sodium (the most abundant osmotically active plasma cation) concentrations, and concurrent decreases in total body water content among larvae that survived various treatments. Tidal oscillations in salinity appeared to temper the desiccating effects of salinity, as changes in body water content and sodium ion concentration were less abrupt than fixed salinity treatments. These results suggest larvae cannot osmoregulate in hyperosmotic environments, but are able to tolerate some fixed and oscillating hyperosmotic salinity exposure. Consequently, larvae may be able to occur in certain areas of estuaries, such as oligohaline habitats that are characterized by low levels of salinity. Experimental results were used, in part, to guide larval sampling in a tidally-influenced habitat. Occurrence of larval Pacific lamprey and Lampetra spp. (western <b>brook</b> and river <b>lampreys)</b> was subsequently investigated across a gradient of salinity in Ellsworth Creek (Pacific County, Washington) by electrofishing. Larval Pacific and Lampetra spp. were detected within an approximately 300 m long tidally-influenced segment of the study area. Salinity monitoring was conducted in six tidally-influenced reaches where larvae were detected for up to 14 d following electrofishing. Maximum tidal cycle salinity exceeded 15 ppt during 52 % to 80 % of tidal cycles within tidally-influenced reaches where larvae were detected. These results suggest potential for larval lamprey to occur in certain portions of tidal estuaries. However, long-term residence of larvae in tidally-influenced habitats and whether larvae are able to subsequently survive, grow, transform, and out-migrate is not known and requires further study. Given the potential for tidally-influenced habitats to be occupied by larvae, assessments of larval occurrence in other areas, such as the lower Columbia River, may be warranted. Knowledge of larval lamprey distribution in estuarine environments may be valuable for habitat restoration, and mitigating potential impacts from dredging and other human disturbances...|$|R

5000|$|The {{southern}} brook lamprey's {{life cycle}} {{consists of two}} main stages: larval and adult. During the larval stage, the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> inhabits a distinct micro habitat involving relatively slow moving water and a sandy substrate. The consistency of the substrate is vitally important to the Southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> because during the larval stage, the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> burrows into the substrate using its oral disk as an anchor. The southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> secretes mucus from its body to form a tube leading {{to the entrance of}} the burrow and to provide support for the burrow. The formation of this larval burrow relies on the composition and size of the substrate available. The combination of both small and large particles and coarse and fine sand grains allow the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> to construct a suitable burrow that allows enough water to flow through the burrow to ensure proper respiration. The substrate in which larval southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> burrow must not contain too many fine silt and clay particles as this would inhibit respiration while too many particles of coarse sand would hinder proper burrow construction. The larval stage is complete after approximately three years. Following the larval stage, the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form. Adult southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> are found in crevices and cracks between large rocks in deeper, faster moving water than the habitat occupied during the larval stage. After completing the metamorphosis to adults, southern brook lampreys come together in groups to spawn and, once spawning is complete, the adults die.

Fecundity of the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> averages between 800 and 2500 oocytes. Human factors have been found to influence the available habitat for spawning southern brook lampreys. Southern brook lampreys have been recorded using shallow areas under bridges as spawning grounds possibly to help conceal spawning aggregations from visual predators.|$|E
