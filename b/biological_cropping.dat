40|$|Multiple {{hypotheses}} {{have emerged}} {{to explain the}} apparent paradox of high diversity of the deep-sea benthos when the environmental conditions are often predicted to inhibit rather than promote diversity. Many fundamental facets of these paradigms remain incompletely understood despite being central to understanding how deep-sea ecosystems, and more generally all ecosystems, function. Here, we examine nine major paradigms of deep-sea diversity that deserve, in our opinion, a fresh research impetus. We purposely challenge many of these ideas to generate dialogue and encourage further research. Some of the axiomatic predictions of these paradigms are: (i) the deep sea is highly diverse; (ii) stable environments reduce competition; (iii) species have finely partitioned niches; (iv) <b>biological</b> <b>cropping</b> promotes diversity; (v) disturbance controls diversity; (vi) patch mosaics structure assemblages; (vii) productivity controls diversity; (viii) recovery from disturbance is slow; and (ix) the deep sea is notoriously under-sampled. We critically examine the evidence {{for each of these}} predictions and highlight areas where knowledge gaps exist and linkages to general ecological theory should occur. We conclude each section with ideas about questions and hypotheses that may fruitfully be tackled in future projects...|$|E

40|$|Photorhabdus is {{a member}} of the family Enterobacteriaceae that lives in a mutualistic {{association}} with a Heterorhabditis nematode worm.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{limitations}} to enhance sustainability of crop production systems is the inability to control root-feeding nematodes without using chemical biocides. In soils under wild vegetation, however, root-feeding nematodes affect plant performance and plant community composition varying from substantially to insignificantly. Previous studies in natural ecosystems have already shown that mutualistic symbionts, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and endophytes, may influence plant exposure to root-feeding nematodes. In order to learn more from natural systems, we examined nematode control in the root zone of a wild coastal foredune grass by microorganisms, other nematodes and microarthropods. We cultured all eight root-feeding nematode species {{that occur in the}} root zone of marram grass (Ammophila arenaria) in coastal foredunes of the Netherlands. Then, in an indoor growth experiment we exposed each nematode species to the potential natural antagonists collected from the same dune soil. Most of the eight dominant root-feeding nematode species could be controlled to some extent by more than one group of soil organisms added. The effectiveness of control varied among nematode species, which seemed to be controlled in a species-specific way. We conclude that in a natural soil the effectiveness of control by microorganisms, other nematodes or microarthropods varies among root-feeding nematode species. Most are controlled, at least to some extent, by soil microbes. However, some root-feeding nematode species are controlled only by microarthropods. Our results strongly suggest that sustainable agriculture will benefit from using a range of biological control mechanisms when controlling root-feeding nematodes, rather than relying on single control agents. Our suggestion also implies that conserving soil biodiversity is crucial in order to enhance the reliability of <b>biological</b> <b>crop</b> protection against soil-borne pests and diseases. ...|$|R

Sixty households were randomly selected in each of the communities to give a total of 300 households. Data were collected on the characteristics of the chemical products, households’ socio-economic variables such as age and education, as well as, on farm input and output quantities and prices in the 2009 / 2010 periods using a pre-tested questionnaire. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and budgetary techniques. The Results obtained show a male dominant, fairly literate farming household, with small landholdings (comprising mainly cereal and legume fields) that are predominantly inherited and located far away from the homestead. Inorganic fertilizers, organic manure, improved seeds and pesticides are known as commercial inputs/ products used on farmers’ fields, while agrolizer, apron plus and boost extra are the emerging products. The average quantity of inputs applied varied across the zones. The total quantity of inorganic fertilizer applied on the fields was highest in the NGS (924 kg) and lowest in the Sudan (676 kg). However, fertilizer application per hectare by respondents was below recommended dosages across the zones. The emerging chemical inputs (Agrolizer, Boost Extra and Apron Plus) were used only in Compro communities in the derived savanna (DS) and southern guinea savanna (SGS) by a small number of households. The results obtained from budgetary analysis show that gross margin per hectare was highest in the SGS ($ 254) where the emerging inputs were used by 41. 7 % of the households and lowest in the Sahel ($ 76). Organic fertilizer was used only in small quantities in the AEZs. Total variable costs accounted for more than 30 % of revenue generated, and labour and fertilizer accounted for the highest percentage of these costs. The study concludes that promoting the emerging chemical inputs through increased accessibility and farmers’ training on their appropriate agronomic use would increase farmers’ income generating potentials for sustainable crop production across the AEZs.

Developments on crop adapted spraying for fungal control are highlighted in arable crop spraying. A plant-specific variable volume precision sprayer, guided by foliage shape and volume (canopy density sprayer; CDS) was developed for bed-grown crops to apply fungicides. Sensor selection to quantify crop canopy and spray techniques to apply variable dose rates are evaluated based on laboratory measurements. Based on the laboratory experience a prototype CDS sprayer was built using either a Weed-IT ® or a GreenSeeker ® sensor to detect plant place (fluorescence) or size (reflectance). Variable rate application was either done with a pulse width modulation nozzle or a switchable four-nozzle body. Spray volume could be changed from 50 to 550 l ha− 1 in 16 steps.
