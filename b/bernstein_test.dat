40|$|During {{the past}} 20 months, 28 {{patients}} with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux {{were treated with}} the Angelchik anti-reflux prosthesis. The patients {{ranged in age from}} 12 to 75 years, with symptoms present from one to 24 years. Vigorous medical management had failed with all patients prior to surgery. Before operation, 28 of 28 patients had upper GI x-rays, 27 of 28 fiberoptic esophagogastroscopy, 26 of 27 esophageal biopsy, eight of 28 <b>Bernstein</b> <b>testing,</b> and 24 of 28 lower esophageal sphincter pressure and motility. Eight patients had strictures requiring preoperative or postoperative dilatation. In four of 28 patients, a Nissen procedure had been previously done. In addition, two patients had metaplastic epithelium, and a single patient a previous Heller myotomy. Twenty-five of the 28 patients are completely asymptomatic eight to 20 months after Angelchik insertion. Fifteen patients had surgery more than one year previously. There are no recurrent hiatal hernias. Endoscopy and biopsy reveal resolution or marked improvement in the esophagitis. Seven patients complained of transient dysphagia lasting up to three months. One patient has persistent "gas bloat" syndrome. There were no technical or perioperative complications. Trouble with the prosthesis occurred in two patients; in one, the prosthesis disrupted and fell into the pelvis, and in the other the prosthesis migrated into the mediastinum. LES pressures preoperatively were 6. 17 +/- 0. 9 and 16. 95 +/- 1. 76 mmHg for the 19 patients studied after operation. The limited sample of patients who were studied with preoperative and postoperative acid-reflux tests have all shown improvement in their score. The Angelchik prosthesis in this series has been safe, simple, and reproducible, and can eliminate the symptoms and signs of gastroesophageal reflux...|$|R
40|$|Angina-like {{chest pain}} of non-cardiac origin {{is a major}} {{diagnostic}} and therapeutic problem. The oesophagus is frequently suspected to {{be the cause of}} the chest pain in these patients. However, a positive statement for the oesophageal origin of the pain can only be made when during manometry or pH-monitoring the familiar pain attack appears to be accompanied by reflux, severe motor disorders or a combination of both. Due to the intermittent nature of the pain this is only rarely the case during short-listing conventional examinations. Provocation tests have been used to induce the familiar chest pain. The <b>Bernstein</b> acid perfusion <b>test</b> and the edrophonium test yield the best results. Prolonged (24 -hour) ambulatory recording of intra-oesophageal pressure and pH to increase the chances of recording chest pain concomitantly with an episode of reflux and/or motor disorders appears to be the most sensitive and also the most physiological test. It is the only test that provides reliable information on the underlying mechanism of the pain, especially in patients with the syndrome of irritable oesophagus, thus contributing in establishing the appropriate therapy for these patients. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is {{a common}} cause of chronic cough. Moreover, chronic cough can be the sole {{presenting}} manifestation of GER disease (GERD). It has been suggested recently that GER most often causes chronic cough by stimulating the distal esophagus. To gain further diagnostic and pathophysiologic knowledge, we prospectively evaluated a group of patients with chronic cough likely {{to be due to}} GER with extensive gastrointestinal and respiratory studies and then observed their response to antireflux therapy. METHODS: We prospectively characterized 12 subjects whose chronic cough was likely to be due to GER by chest radiographs, barium esophagography, 24 -h esophageal pH monitoring (EPM) with probes in the distal and proximal esophagus, esophagoscopy, and bronchoscopy. Then, prior to instituting antireflux therapy, we objectively counted coughs during the distal esophageal infusion of 0. 1 N HCl or 0. 9 percent saline solution administered in a randomized, double-blind, standardized fashion (ie, <b>Bernstein</b> acid-perfusion <b>test).</b> RESULTS: Gastroesophageal reflux was determined to cause cough in all subjects based on disappearance of cough with antireflux therapy. It was clinically 2 ̆ 2 silent 2 ̆ 2 in 75 percent. The EPM was the test most frequently abnormal (sensitivity, 92 percent). Distal esophageal data revealed that 10 of 12 subjects had GER-induced coughs (12 +/- 12) while only 7 of 12 had an abnormal esophageal pH conventional parameter (eg, percent time pH 3 ̆c 4). Compared with the distal esophagus, GER to the proximal esophagus occurred (p = 0. 017) and induced cough (p = 0. 004) less often. Compared with baseline (9. 3 +/- 17. 6), there were no differences in coughs induced by the infusion of saline solution (9. 2 +/- 15. 9) or acid (15. 1 +/- 26. 7); the number of coughs induced by acid was negatively correlated with distal esophageal acid-GER events during EPM (r = - 0. 64, p = 0. 01). Neither bronchoscopy nor chest radiographs were consistent with aspiration. CONCLUSIONS: There is a clinical profile that prospectively predicts which patients have chronic cough due to GER. The cough was most likely due to stimulation of the distal esophagus, not aspiration. Intraesophageal acid is unlikely to be the sole mediator in gastric juice causing the cough. While EPM is the single most helpful diagnostic test, conventionally utilized diagnostic indices of GERD can be misleadingly normal; observing GER-induced coughs is more frequently helpful...|$|R
40|$|From the 19 th of July to the 19 th of October 1999, we {{conducted}} a study to evaluate the diagnostic capabilities/benefits of the double contrast barium esophagogram in patients with esophagitis. The sample patients were taken from patients with reflux-type dyspepsia who visited the out patient clinic of the Sub-department of Gastroenterology of the Department of Internal Medicine of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Indonesia/Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta. During the duration of study, 32 patients fulfilled the criteria for inclusion, and did not fulfill the criteria for exclusion. All of the subjects underwent double contrast barium esophagogram, <b>Bernstein</b> <b>test,</b> and endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract, as well as biopsy of the lower third esophageal mucosa. The chief complaints for reflux type dyspepsia {{were found in the}} following order: pyrosis/heartburn (56. 26 %), acid/sour taste in the mouth (12. 5 %), chest pain (9. 38 %), swallowing disturbance (6. 25 %), breathing difficulties (6. 25 %), belching (6. 25 %), and palpitation (3. 12 %). From the 32 patients with reflux type dyspepsia that underwent double contrast barium esophagogram, 10 patients (31. 25 %) were found positive for esophagitis, and the remaining 22 patients were found to be negative (68. 75 %). <b>Bernstein</b> <b>test</b> found 11 patients (34. 37 %) positive and 21 (65. 63 %) negative, while endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract showed positive esophagitis in 25 patients (78. 13 %) and negative in 7 patients (21. 87 %). The degree of accordance between double contrast barium esophagogram and the <b>Bernstein</b> <b>test</b> or even {{a combination of the two}} was unsatisfactory in diagnosing esophagitis in reflux type dyspepsia. Based on this, this study concludes that double contrast barium esophagogram and Bernstein are incapable of replacing endoscopic examination in establishing the diagnosis of esophagitis...|$|E

40|$|ISDE VANCOUVER 2014 Abstract 669 "Esophageal {{sensitivity}} and visceral pain perception in health is not modulated by endogenous opioid release" Background:When gastro-esophageal reflux is causing symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation) or lesions (esophagitis), it {{is defined as}} gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). A large group of patients does not present with esophageal lesions and {{are referred to as}} non-erosive reflux disease patients (NERD). Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are effective in healing esophagitis, but a large group of NERD patients remains symptomatic while taking PPIs. In these patients, esophageal hypersensitivity is considered an important pathophysiological mechanism and this is often linked to defective functioning of descending anti-nociceptive pathways, although evidence to support this hypothesis is lacking. Endogenous opioids are key candidate mediators of descending anti-nociception. Our aim was to study the role of centrally acting and peripherally restricted µ-opioid receptor antagonists naloxone and methylnaltrexone respectively on esophageal sensitivity in healthy volunteers (HV). Methods:Esophageal multimodal sensitivity was quantified after administration of naloxone (20 µg/kg/h IV infusion after 0. 4 mg bolus), methylnaltrexone (12 mg/ 0. 6 ml SC injection) and placebo (0. 9 % NaCl) in 12 HV (7 m/ 5 f, mean age 31 y [range 22 - 51]). After an overnight fast, a custom made probe with a balloon was positioned in the distal esophagus. Thermal (recirculating a heated solution through the balloon), mechanical (increasing balloon volume), electrical (2 stimulation electrodes) and chemical sensitivity (modified <b>Bernstein)</b> were <b>tested.</b> Perception scores were evaluated on Visual Analogue Scales (VAS). Stimulus intensities were evaluated for first perception (VAS 1), pain perception threshold (VAS 5) and pain toleration threshold (VAS 7). General mood was assessed by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-state) questionnaires before and after the stimulations. Results were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA or the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. P-values of < 0. 05 were considered significant. Results:Both naloxone and methylnaltrexone had no significant influence on esophageal sensitivity compared to placebo conditions. First perception, VAS 5 and VAS 7 thresholds did not differ when comparing naloxone or methylnaltrexone with placebo conditions during all stimulations. There was no difference for PANAS and STAI-State questionnaires before and after the stimulations for the different sessions. Discussion:To our knowledge, this is the first study to address the role of endogenous opioids in determining esophageal sensitivity in health. We found no evidence of a tonic inhibitory effect of endogenous opioid pathways on esophageal sensitivity in health. The mechanisms of esophageal visceral pain perception are independent of endogenous opioid release. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that radiofrequency energy delivery at the gastroesophageal junction (the Stretta procedure) induces symptom relief in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), although improvement of acid exposure on pH monitoring was usually limited. A role for decreased esophageal sensitivity has been suggested. Our aim was to evaluate the influence of Stretta on symptoms, acid exposure, and sensitivity to esophageal acid perfusion in GERD. Thirteen patients with established proton pump inhibitor (PPI) -dependent GERD (three males; mean age, 51 +/- 10 years) participated in the study. Before and 6 months after the procedure symptom score, pH monitoring and <b>Bernstein</b> acid perfusion <b>test</b> were performed. The latter was done by infusing HCl (pH 0. 1) at a rate of 6 ml/min 15 cm proximal to the gastroesophageal junction for a maximum of 30 min or until the patients experienced heartburn. Results were compared by Student's t-test. Stretta procedure time was 51 +/- 4 min and no complications occurred. After 6 months, the symptom score was significantly improved (12. 5 +/- 2. 0 to 7. 5 +/- 2. 1; P< 0. 05), seven patients no longer needed daily PPI, and acid exposure was significantly decreased (11. 6 %+/- 1. 6 % to 8. 5 %+/- 1. 8 % of time pH< 4; P< 0. 05). The time needed to induce heartburn during acid perfusion decreased from 9. 5 +/- 2. 3 to 18. 1 +/- 3. 4 min (P= 0. 01), and five patients became insensitive to 30 -min acid perfusion, versus none at baseline (P= 0. 04). In conclusion, the Stretta procedure induces subjective improvement of GERD symptoms and decreases esophageal acid exposure. In addition, esophageal acid sensitivity is decreased 6 months after the Stretta procedure. The mechanism underlying this finding and its relevance to symptom control require further studies. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Bernstein</b> <b>test</b> {{has been}} used as a test of {{oesophageal}} acid sensitivity for over 30 years but its clinical value has been challenged by the advent of ambulatory pH monitoring. Furthermore, the relation between mucosal acid sensitivity, symptomatic reflux, and abnormal oesophageal acid exposure time is unclear. This study examined the relation between these three parameters in patients referred for pH monitoring with unexplained chest pain or heartburn. Fifty consecutive patients were studied - nine with non-cardiac chest pain and 41 with a history of heartburn. Symptomatic reflux was defined as a greater than or equal to 50 % temporal association between pain episodes and reflux events (pH less than 4) during pH monitoring. A positive acid perfusion test (in which the patient's usual symptoms were evoked by acid, though not saline) had a 100 % sensitivity, 73 % specificity, and 81 % accuracy for the detection of symptomatic reflux. All 10 patients with symptomatic reflux during pH monitoring had evidence of mucosal acid sensitivity. A negative acid perfusion test made symptomatic reflux unlikely. However, symptomatic reflux or a positive acid perfusion test, or both, were found in some patients with a normal oesophageal acid exposure time during pH monitoring. Mucosal acid sensitivity, abnormal oesophageal acid exposure time, and symptomatic reflux should be regarded as separate, though related aspects of reflux disease. The <b>Bernstein</b> <b>test</b> is simple, safe, and easily performed. A positive test helps to identify an oesophageal cause of symptoms, particularly in patients in whom other aspects of 'gastro-oesophageal reflux disease' are absent, or who do not have symptoms during pH monitoring...|$|E

Patients and 6 healthy volunteers underwent <b>Bernstein</b> <b>test</b> (BT) and digital infrared thermographic imaging (DITI) simultaneously. The positive rate for BT in group I and group II was 22. 2 % and 55. 6 %, respectively, and the DITI positive rate was 55. 6 % for group I and 50. 0 % for group II. None of healthy control were positive in BT or DITI. All subjects with DITI positive were hypothermic. The overall accordance rate between DITI and BT was 69. 7 %. All group I patients showed a diffuse type, while in group 11, 4 patients showed diffuse type and 5 patients showed localized type (p< 0. 05). In patients with DITI (+) /BT (-), 83. 3 % showed diffuse type, whereas equal numbers of diffuse and localized type were noted in patients with DITI (+) /BT (+).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} sudy was to {{investigate}} if oesophageal acid stimulation (<b>Bernstein</b> <b>test)</b> had an influence on heart rate and blood pressure variability and baroreflex gain. We compared the cardiovascular responses in 10 patients with established gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (Group 1) and 10 control subjects (Group 2) during oesophageal saline and 0. 1 mol/l hydrochloric acid instillation. Indices of heart rate and blood pressure variability and baroreflex gain (derived from linear spontaneous sequences and cross spectral analysis) were calculated. In Group 1 the standard deviation of RR intervals (SDRR: 46 ms vs. 51 ms, p= 0. 030) and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD: 24 ms vs. 26 ms, p= 0. 027) were significantly lower during acid infusions, than during saline.

40|$|Oral bethanechol {{has been}} shown to produce a {{sustained}} rise in lower esophageal sphincter pressure. We studied its effect on 20 patients with chronic heartburn refractory to usual therapy. All patients had a positive <b>Bernstein</b> <b>test</b> and manometric evidence of lower esophageal sphincter incompetence. In a randomized double-blind crossover study, each patient received either 25 mg bethanechol or placebo four times/day for 2 months; after a 2 -month rest period the opposite treatment (drug or placebo) was given for 2 months. The patients ' symptoms were evaluated each month of the study. Antacid, taken ad lib., was quantitated monthly. The results showed significant (P < 0. 05) improvement in heartburn symptoms and decreased antacid use during bethanechol therapy. Bethanechol may be a welcome addition to therapy of refractory heartburn. INCOMPETENCE of the pressure barrier at the gastro-esophageal junction is {{a major factor in the}} pathophysiology of gastroesophageal reflux. Patients with chronic sympto-matic reflux have been shown to have decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressures when compared with normal persons (1). Recent studies in our laboratory have indi-cated that subcutaneous administration of the cholinergic agent bethanechol markedly increases lower esophageal sphincter pressure of both control subjects and patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux (2). Subsequently, oral administration of bethanechol was shown to have a marked and sustained stimulatory effect on lower esopha-geal sphincter pressure of chronic reflux patients (3). This response suggested that oral bethanechol might be effective in the therapy of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux.
