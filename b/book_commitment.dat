In her 1972 <b>book,</b> <b>Commitment</b> & Community: Communes and Utopias in Sociological Perspective, she argued that the internal characteristics of a utopian community lead to its success or failure. Kanter defined a “successful” commune as one that lasted for longer than thirty-three years. After surveying ninety-one communal projects from the period between 1780 and 1860, she determined that communal {{groups such as the}} Shakers, Amana, and Oneida were among the most successful nineteenth-century communes. To explain their success, Kanter noted these groups' rituals and clear boundaries for membership, as well as the [...] "commitment mechanisms" [...] that utopians utilized: sacrifice, investment, renunciation, communion, mortification and transcendence. She concluded that the more that a utopian community asked of its members, the more cohesive and long-lasting it was.|$|E

Oh mankind! If you desire to invoke your good, forget sectarian conflict. Be regardful to all the past prophets. Be attached to your living master or God and take only those who love Him as your own. Because all the past prophets are consummated in the divine man of the present." [...] Anukulchandra did not accept anyone as his disciple {{if he or she}} wanted to change his or her faith. According to Ramesh Nagaraj Rao, Anukulchandra advocated that people of all faith could come together and strengthen communal harmony.

40|$|I {{recently}} overheard {{a colleague}} say that though {{is he not}} against gay people, {{he does not believe}} they should get married. Yes, this ever-present issue continues well into 2010 and continues to rear its controversial head. And so I have decided to put my two cents in. I do understand that people are afraid of what is unfamiliar, and I also understand that people are afraid of change, but the ironic part is the fact that marriage and its infrastructure, so to speak, have always been in a state or process of adaptation. While my colleague was essentially concluding that that if gay people legally marry, the institution of marriage will forever be altered, he was unfortunately overlooking the fact that marriage has historically done just that- changed, adapted and evolved. In her new <b>book,</b> <b>Commitment,</b> Elizabeth Gilbert chronicles the evolution of marriage and logically concludes that change is an inherent part of its meaning. Historically, marriage has gone through several “versions”. While marriage today is defined as a sacred union between two, non-related people (and with gender of course under consideration), for much of history it was seen as a union between one man and several women, or two men (as in Ancient Rome), as well as between cross-cousins or eve...|$|E

40|$|The {{under-representation}} {{of women}} and over-representation of men in trade unions raises questions as to why it occurs, its consequences for women {{and how it can}} be overcome. This thesis engages with these questions. It indicates the dominant ideologies and institutions which underpin the dominant male model of trade unions and discusses strategies designed to change the 'rules of the game'. The creation of UNISON on 1 st July 1993 provides a research site in which to study the extent to which trade union democracy can be deliberately re-shaped so as to reflect the interests of women. UNISON represents 1. 3 million workers within the public service sector, two-thirds of whom are women. It has been the express intention of UNISON to achieve gender democracy through empowering its women members to participate in its representative structures. In particular, the adoption of three key principles in the rule book: proportionality for women, fair representation at all levels and self-organisation for four disadvantaged groups, is intended to {{have a significant impact on}} the nature of women's involvement in the union. This thesis contains extensive case study material collected within UNISON over a two year period, ending November 1995. It reveals the opportunities which the three rule <b>book</b> <b>commitments</b> provide for effective representation by women in UNISON. By excluding men so that women can take the majority of representative positions, proportionality and fair representation change the predominant values and beliefs of trade union democracy. By providing opportunities for women to determine their own agenda, in the absence of men, self-organisation challenges the ideology that union strength is based on unity and common interests. However, the dominant model of trade unionism is not being re-shaped without tension or resistance. This thesis argues that ideologies and institutions remain which prevent women's access to representative structures being translated into the discussion of women's concerns in UNISON's decision making arena.

This article recognizes that Balkin’s dichotomy between “hard-wired” rules and abstract principles in constitutional interpretation succeeds in justifying a broad constitutional construction including apparently illegitimate constitutional changes such as Reconstruction and the New Deal. In addition, this article concedes that Balkin’s acceptance and revision of constitutional historicism from Ackerman’s theory are convincing because the dynamism of constitutional security, Living Constitutionalism, can be normatively controllable through historical reference even though Living Constitutionalism is frequently conceived of as approval of easy transition of the Constitution. This article also supports Balkin’s implication that positive judgment of the Constitution by the judiciary contributes to promotion of democracy and popular sovereignty as establishment of equal citizenship.
