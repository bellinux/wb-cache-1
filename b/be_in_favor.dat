5|$|The Argentine government's alarm {{continued}} under de Oca's successor, Estanislao Zeballos. In June 1908, Zeballos {{presented a}} plan to the Argentine Congress where they would offer the Brazilian government a chance to give one of their two unfinished dreadnoughts to Argentina. This would allow the two countries a chance to enjoy relative naval parity. Should the Brazilians refuse, Zeballos planned to issue an ultimatum: {{if they did not}} comply in eight days, the mobilized Argentine Army would invade what the army and navy ministers claimed was a defenseless Rio de Janeiro. Unfortunately for Zeballos, his plan was leaked to the media, and the resulting public outcry—Argentine citizens happened to not <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of their government borrowing large sums of money to mobilize the army and go to war—ensured his resignation.|$|E
25|$|Francis Jourdain said of {{the society}} in which he grew up that it was {{dominated}} by people who were highly opionated and quick to take sides. Although its members pretended to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of liberty and compassion, he saw it as tainted by prejudices, xenophobia and extreme emotion. His father was very much typical of this society.|$|E
25|$|Jackson has commended Obama's 2012 {{decision}} to support gay marriage and has compared {{the fight for}} same-sex marriage to fight against slavery and the anti-miscegenation laws that once prevented interracial marriage. He would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of federal legislation extending marriage rights to gays, because he feels that if this issue is left up to the states, some states will continue to deny gays equal protection and equal rights.|$|E

25|$|The Memorandum's {{defenders}} claims go as follows: {{far from}} {{calling for a}} breakup of Yugoslavia on Greater Serbian lines claimed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of Yugoslavia. Its support for Yugoslavia was however conditional on fundamental changes to end what the Memorandum argued was the discrimination against Serbia which was inbuilt into the Yugoslav constitution. The chief of these changes was abolition of the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina. According to Norman Cigar, because the changes were unlikely to be accepted passively, {{the implementation of the}} Memorandum's program would only be possible by force.|$|E
25|$|In April 2007, the {{government}} of Morocco suggested that a self-governing entity, through the Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs (CORCAS), should govern the territory {{with some degree of}} autonomy for Western Sahara. The project was presented to the United Nations Security Council in mid-April 2007, and quickly gained French and US support. Polisario had handed in its own proposal the day before, which insisted on the previously agreed referendum, but allowed for negotiating the status of Moroccans now living in the territory should the outcome of a referendum <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of independence. This led to the negotiations process known as the Manhasset negotiations. Four rounds were held in 2007 and 2008; no progress was made, however, as both parties refused to compromise about what they considered core sovereignty issues. Polisario agreed to add autonomy as per the Moroccan proposal to a referendum ballot, but refused to relinquish the concept of an independence referendum itself, as agreed in 1991 and 1997. Morocco, in its turn, insisted on only negotiating the terms of autonomy offered, but refused to consider an option of independence on the ballot.|$|E
500|$|Dawa Norbu {{argues that}} modern Chinese Communist historians tend to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> {{of the view}} that the Ming simply reappointed old Yuan dynasty {{officials}} in Tibet and perpetuated their rule of Tibet in this manner. Norbu writes that, although this would have been true for the eastern Tibetan regions of Amdo and Kham's [...] "tribute-cum-trade" [...] relations with the Ming, it was untrue if applied to the western Tibetan regions of Ü-Tsang and Ngari. After the Phagmodrupa Changchub Gyaltsen, these were ruled by [...] "three successive nationalistic regimes," [...] which Norbu writes [...] "Communist historians prefer to ignore." ...|$|E

500|$|On June 10, McGovern won the California {{primary and}} secured the Democratic nomination. The {{following}} month, Nixon was renominated at the 1972 Republican National Convention. He dismissed the Democratic platform as cowardly and divisive. McGovern intended to sharply reduce defense spending and supported amnesty for draft evaders {{as well as}} abortion rights. With some of his supporters believed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of drug legalization, McGovern was perceived as standing for [...] "amnesty, abortion and acid". McGovern was also damaged by his vacillating support for his original running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, dumped from the ticket following revelations that he had received treatment for depression. Nixon was ahead in most polls for the entire election cycle, and was reelected on November 7, 1972 {{in one of the}} largest landslide election victories in American history. He defeated McGovern with over 60percent of the popular vote, losing only in Massachusetts and the District of Columbia.|$|E

2500|$|In a concurring opinion, Associate Justice Hugo L. Black {{notes that}} as per his {{previous}} dissents, he {{agrees that the}} Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizure is enforceable against the states. He writes that he would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of the reversal of {{the decision of the}} lower courts if he thought that the Fourth Amendment, by itself, barred not only unreasonable searches and seizures, but also the use of evidence so obtained. However, he agrees with the implication evident from the Court’s opinion in that the federal exclusionary rule is “not a command of the Fourth Amendment but is a judicially created rule of evidence which Congress might negate.” He concludes that this implication leads him “to concur in the Court’s judgment of affirmance.” ...|$|E
2500|$|While at the {{beginning}} of the Civil Rights Era there was some push from White Christians to integrate churches, after there was [...] "a white backlash against black progress," [...] the push ended as White Americans were less inclined to push for social segregation. However, many historians have noted that religion was an important motivator for people to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of civil rights, as they saw racism as sinful or unchristian. This may have varied widely by region, as Southern pastors were much more racist than their Northern counterparts. Additionally, many evangelical Christians believed that integration and equality may be impossible, as they believed that the world was descending into chaos as a precursor to [...] "the second coming," [...] when Jesus would return to the Earth as described in the Book of Revelation.|$|E
