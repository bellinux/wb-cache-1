5|$|August 23, 2000– The National Hurricane Center {{forecasts}} Hurricane Debby to {{pass through}} the Florida Keys as a Category 2 hurricane, with one computer model predicting a Category4 hurricane in the area. This results in officials declaring a mandatory evacuation for all non-residents in the keys, causing a significant loss of tourism revenue for Monroe County. Debby dissipates <b>before</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> area, though its remnants produce heavy rainfall across southern Florida.|$|E
5|$|After {{boosting}} the trim power by 50 percent, adjusting the aerodynamics, and other modifications, two further mated test flights {{were carried out}} before Schoch {{was able to make}} a successful release and hookup on 14 October 1948. During the fifth free flight on 22 October 1948, Schoch again found it difficult to hook the Goblin to the bomber's trapeze, aborting four attempts <b>before</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> trapeze bar and breaking the hook on the XF-85's nose. Again, a forced landing was successfully carried out at Muroc.|$|E
5|$|All of the aircrew {{involved}} in the crash had only limited flying time {{in the months before}} the crash. The B-52's aircrew were apparently unaware that the aircraft had stalled until shortly before impact, indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery techniques to the aircraft once it entered the stall. The investigation reported that, even if the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, the aircraft was likely too low to recover <b>before</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|E

50|$|In {{the final}} the {{favourite}} Curryhills Gara broke well and led until halfway <b>before</b> <b>Hit</b> <b>The</b> Lid {{took over the}} lead. Stouke Whisper remained prominent as the back three crowded each other. Curryhills Gara and Stouke Whisper touched at the third bend allowing <b>Hit</b> <b>the</b> Lid to run out the winner.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Paine {{contributed to}} one of the most {{significant}} flooding events in Oklahoma history. The 16th tropical storm and 8th hurricane of the 1986 Pacific hurricane season, Paine formed on September 28 off the southeast coast of Mexico. It moved around a ridge, later turning to the north and brushing the Baja California Peninsula. By that time, Paine had attained peak winds of 100mph (155km/h), but it weakened slightly <b>before</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> Mexican state of Sonora. The remnant moisture combined with a cold front to produce heavy rainfall in the south-central United States.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{entering}} West Nyack, NY59 intersects the Palisades Interstate Parkway (exit8) and NY304. The route proceeds onward, passing Palisades Center, one of {{the largest}} shopping malls in the country. Immediately after passing the Palisades Center, NY59 briefly enters Central Nyack. Here it connects to NY303 by way of an interchange. <b>Before</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> Nyack village line, NY59 has its final interchange with the Thruway. The southbound entrance to the Tappan Zee Bridge is via Mountainview Avenue, and the northbound entrance is via Polhemus Street.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{struggled}} {{to put a}} flowing move together in the opening exchanges, but it was United who had the better chances, both falling to Ronaldo. The first came in the seventhminute: having been played the ball by Michael Carrick, Ronaldo turned away from Piqué {{on the edge of}} the centre circle, before hitting a shot just wide from almost 40yards; the second saw the ball break to Ronaldo after Anderson and Patrice Evra had linked up well down the left flank. The Portuguese winger controlled the ball on the chest <b>before</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> ball just past the far post.|$|E

While driving through a snowstorm, Paul accidentally hits Stephen King with his car, causing Paul to swerve {{off the road and}} crash into a snowbank, while King gets the idea for another novel within seconds and manages to finish writing the plot in just a few seconds <b>before</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> ground completely unscathed.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} fight as undisputed welterweight champion, he fought Cosme Rivera on May 14, 2005, at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Judah sent Rivera {{down with a}} {{straight}} left hand to the face less than 30seconds into the bout. Rivera beat the count, but was knocked down again about 10seconds later. Judah hit Rivera hard {{several times in the}} second round, and in the third round, he connected with a left uppercut, that caused Rivera to stagger backwards and fall into the ropes <b>before</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> canvas. Rivera rose at the count of five, but he was badly hurt and the referee stopped the fight.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 1945, a Fireball of VF-41 {{became the}} first {{aircraft}} to land under jet power on an aircraft carrier, albeit without prior planning. After the radial engine of an FR-1 failed on final approach to the escort carrier , the pilot managed to start the jet engine and land, barely catching the last arrestor wire <b>before</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> ship's crash barrier. The squadron was attempting to qualify its pilots for carrier operations during this time, but only 14 of its 22 pilots made the six required takeoffs and landings. A number of accidents occurred when the nose gear failed on landing, but the pilots were at least partly responsible as they were slamming the nose gear onto the deck after landing on the main gear.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Alice was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean to receive a female name. It was a rare off-season tropical cyclone that hit Central America, Cuba, and Florida in late May to early June 1953. Alice formed on May 25 in the western Caribbean, and executed a large loop over Central America. It passed over western Cuba, causing heavy rainfall and possibly several casualties from drowning. It then executed another loop in the Gulf of Mexico, reached a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h), and weakened <b>before</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> Florida panhandle on June 6. Although heavy rainfall occurred in Florida, there was little damage.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Kelly was a weak but {{destructive}} {{tropical storm}} that struck the Philippines in June1981. A tropical disturbance organized into a tropical depression {{east of the}} Philippines on June28. It tracked westward, reaching tropical storm on June30 <b>before</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> central Philippines. Kelly weakened over the islands, but re-strengthened over the South China Sea, nearly attaining typhoon status on July2. The system passed through the southern Hainan Island on July3. The cyclone then crossed the Gulf of Tonkin as a weakening tropical storm, and made landfall in northern Vietnam on July4 as a tropical storm. Kelly dissipated two days later inland.|$|E
5|$|On the 36th lap, Glock's right-rear {{suspension}} failed {{coming out}} of the final corner. He spun through 180 degrees <b>before</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> pit wall with a strong rearward impact, with debris flying across the track. The car, pointing the wrong way, rolled to a stop on the grass. A dazed Glock extracted himself before being treated at the medical centre. The safety car was deployed after the accident. When the pit lane opened on lap38, most drivers headed in, including all of the leaders except Hamilton. McLaren believed that Hamilton had enough fuel to stay out, the plan being for him to then rapidly pull away from his heavily-fuelled rivals, after the safety car went in. Hamilton needed to build up enough of a lead to rejoin still in first position, following his final pit stop. This would prove to be very risky, as Massa rejoined in fourth position, fuelled to the finish.|$|E

5|$|The {{definition}} of leg before wicket (lbw) is currently Law 36 in the Laws of Cricket, {{written by the}} Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Before a batsman can be dismissed lbw, the fielding team must appeal to the umpire. If the bowler delivers a no ball — an illegal delivery — the batsman cannot be out lbw under any circumstances. Otherwise, for the batsman to be adjudged lbw, the ball, if it bounces, must pitch in line with or on the off side of the wickets. Then the ball must strike part of the batsman's body without first touching his bat, {{in line with the}} wickets and have been going on to hit the stumps. The batsman may also be out lbw if, having made no attempt to hit the ball with his bat, he is struck outside the line of off stump by a ball that would have hit the wickets. The umpire must assume that the ball would have continued on the same trajectory after striking the batsman, even if it would have bounced <b>before</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> stumps.|$|E
5|$|Midfielder Michael Collins joined on a one-month {{loan from}} Oxford, as {{cover for the}} injured Nolan and Summerfield. Michael Coulson scored with a low shot to give York a 50th-minute lead at home to Cambridge United, and John McCombe scored four minutes later with a curling shot to make the score 2–0. However, Mark Roberts and Barry Corr scored for Cambridge in the last 19 minutes, and the match {{finished}} a 2–2 draw. York knocked League One team Doncaster Rovers out of the Football League Trophy {{in the second round}} with a 2–0 home win. Oliver gave York an early lead with a header into the bottom corner from an Anthony Straker cross, and he doubled the lead early into the second half; after dispossessing Aaron Taylor-Sinclair he lifted the ball over the advancing goalkeeper, Thorsten Stuckmann, <b>before</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> ball into an empty net. York ended Luton Town's four-match winning streak with a 1–1 away draw; Lowe scored late into the first half with a shot into the top of the goal, before Luton equalised in the second half from a Cameron McGeehan penalty. Turner's loan was extended for a second month. York were beaten 3–1 away by Barnet, who had been on a three-match losing streak. After going behind to John Akinde's goal, Coulson equalised for York in the 80th minute with a drilled shot, but goals in the last 10 minutes from Michael Gash and Josh Clarke secured a win for the home team.|$|E

25|$|<b>Before</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> {{main part}} of Johnstown, the flood surge hit the Cambria Iron Works at the town of Woodvale, {{sweeping}} up railroad cars and barbed wire in its moil. Of Woodvale's 1,100 residents, 314 died in the flood. Boilers exploded when the flood hit the Gautier Wire Works, causing black smoke seen by the Johnstown residents. Miles of its barbed wire became entangled in the debris in the flood waters.|$|E
