After this a weapons destruction workshop was set up. This project ran up until March 2009, during which time MAG, along with the Rwandan Authorities, established some further priorities and decided what work was to be done from April 2009 onwards.|$|E
50|$|MISTY PICTUREwas {{the fourth}} {{test in the}} MISTY CASTLE series of {{large-scale}} High Explosive (HE) tests sponsored by the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA). The test was run on 14 May 1987. The explosive consisted of 4685 tons of an Ammonium Nitrate and Fuel Oil (ANFO) mixture loaded in bulk into a 44-foot radius fiberglass hemisphere. This is equivalent to 3900 tons of TNT. Detonation of this charge provided an airblast and ground motion environment which was used by numerous agencies to collect <b>basic</b> <b>explosive</b> environmental data and to test a variety of systems and equipment in a simulated nuclear environment. The resulting overpressure from the detonation simulated the approximate equivalent airblast of an 8 kiloton nuclear device.|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} {{has been}} used to simulate different scenarios in sympathetic detonation studies. The objective of this project is to determine if the explosive will detonate due to shock waves or other phenomena. However, to predict the detonation of the explosive using this approach, an adequate reactive model of the explosive is required. The model includes the ignition and growth phases of the process due to shock initiation and detonation wave propagation in the explosive. In this study, a model was developed for cast H- 6 explosive based on available experimental data from the literature. It contains three <b>basic</b> <b>explosive</b> properties: the un-reacted equation of state, the product equation of state, and the rate of reaction for the conversion of the solid explosive to reaction products. This model is available in the Lagrangian hydrodynamic computer codes LS-DYNA as an equation of state (EOS) and {{has been used}} in the numerical modeling of sympathetic detonation. One-dimensional calculations have also been performed and the results obtained agree well with experimental results available...|$|E

5000|$|Just {{before the}} trial, the FBI ordered that a {{polygraph}} test be conducted on Mohamed but it later was discarded after Mohamed struck a guilty plea to receive life sentence without parole. The deal between Mohamed {{and the government}} was struck on October 13, 2000. He was charged with 5 counts of conspiracy. The sentencing trial as shown below identified the specific counts that Ali Mohamed was to be indicted. The first count charges a violation of title 18, under the United States code, section 2332(b) which is the conspiracy to kill nationals of the United States of America wherever {{they are in the}} world. In such case, the citizens were located at the embassy of the United States of America in Kenya and Tanzania. The second count was conspiracy to murder, kidnap and maim outside the United States. This would include the conspiracy to kill US nationals employed by American military in the embassies. Count three was conspiracy to murder, through violating sections 1114 or 1116. Under section 1116, Ali sought to kill United States government employees under their roles as employees of the United States of America. Count five charges a conspiracy to destroy buildings or property owned or leased by the United States government. The government proved that Ali attempted and planned to destroy or damage buildings or property owned or leased by the United States government. Finally, count six is the conspiracy to destroy national defense utilities of the United States government. Ali told the court that he had been involved with the Egyptian Islamic Jihad in the 1980s and was introduced to Osama bin Laden in the 1990s. “In 1992, I conducted military and <b>basic</b> <b>explosives</b> training for al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Among the people I trained were Harun Fadhl and Abu Jihad. I also conducted intelligence training for al Qaeda. I taught my trainees how to create cell structures {{that could be used for}} operations”. [...] Ali then included information in the events leading up to the embassy bombings; “In the early 1990s, I assisted al Qaeda in creating a presence in Nairobi, Kenya, and worked with several others on this project. Abu Ubaidah was in charge of al Qaeda in Nairobi until he drowned. Khalid al Fawwaz set up al Qaeda’s office in Nairobi. A car business was set up to create income. Wadih el Hage created a charity organization that would help provide al Qaeda members with identity documents”. Ali then told the court that he was asked by bin Laden to identify possible targets of which he conducted surveillance on the American Embassy building.|$|R
40|$|It is {{believed}} that <b>explosive</b> <b>basic</b> to ultrabasic eruptions {{may be responsible for}} small cinder conelike features on Mars and perhaps for the ancient flank-scoured paterae. Eruptions of this type may have been driven by near-surface water/ice-magma interactions or volatile rich magmas. Noting that the paterae represent a unique style of volcanism that stopped approximately 2 b. y. ago, it is suggested that the volatiles associated with these features were derived from mantle sources and that the cessation of patera formation may coincide with the termination of the period of maximum planetary degassing. Since approximately 2 b. y. ago volcanism has been dominantly effusive, except for such minor explosive ash events as those that blanketed part of the summit of Hecates Tholus. It is proposed that such eruptions were driven by volatiles generated by differentiation of a magma chamber, similar to Icelandic explosive eruptions...|$|R
5000|$|Developed in 1935 by Rheinmetall-Borsig as a {{commercial}} venture as the MG-101 (later designated MK 101, with the [...] "MK" [...] abbreviating the term Maschinenkanone, as an autocannon), the MK 101 cannon was a 30 mm (1.18 in), long-barreled automatic cannon capable of firing nine different types of 30x184B mm ammunition (ranging from <b>basic</b> high <b>explosive</b> to tungsten-cored armor-piercing rounds). Featuring pneumatic cocking and fired by percussion via an electrical solenoid, the MK 101 was recoil-operated. In operation, the barrel and bolt recoiled 30 mm (1.18 in) to the rear after each shot. The bolt locked via a Stange-type machined sleeve with internal interrupted threads, similar to some Solothurn weapons such as the 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 30 light machine gun. The locking system was strong, but rate of fire was limited to a rather slow 230-260 rpm, which limited its use against other aircraft. Powerful and accurate for its day, it was carried primarily on the Henschel Hs 129 ground-attack aircraft, commencing in late 1941. Fed by a 10-round (early versions) or a 30-round box magazine, the MK 101 could penetrate 75 mm (3 in) of armor at 300 m (330 yd) range. The dozen examples created of the Heinkel He 177A-1/U2 Zerstörer ("Destroyer") experimental prototype attack aircraft used twinned MK 101s on a forward-aimed limited-traverse mount, located in the extreme lower nose {{at the front of}} a dramatically enlarged Bola inverted-casemate gondola emplacement under the nose, and was intended for anti-shipping and possible [...] "train-busting" [...] use, but was never deployed in combat. When it was used from beneath an Hs 129's central fuselage as a ventral gun pod-mounted anti-tank weapon, the MK 101's tungsten-cored AP round was capable of penetrating the turret and side armor of the Soviet KV-1 heavy tank. An electrically-fired version of the MK 101 cannon was later developed and designated the MK 103.|$|R
40|$|Leg 90 {{recovered}} approximately 3705 m of core {{at eight}} sites lying at middle bathyal depths (1000 - 2200 m) (Sites 587 to 594) in a traverse from subtropical to subantarctic latitudes {{in the southwest}} Pacific region, chiefly on Lord Howe Rise in the Tasman Sea. This chapter summarizes some preliminary lithostratigraphic results of the leg and includes data from Site 586, drilled during DSDP Leg 89 on the Ontong-Java Plateau that forms the northern equatorial point of the latitudinal traverse. The lithofacies consist almost exclusively of continuous sections of very pure (> 95 % CaCO 3) pelagic calcareous sediment, typically foraminifer-bearing nannofossil ooze (or chalk) and nannofossil ooze (or chalk), which is mainly of Neogene age but extends back into the Eocene at Sites 588, 592, and 593. Only at Site 594 off southeastern New Zealand is there local development of hemipelagic sediments and several late Neogene unconformities. Increased contents of foraminifers in Leg 90 sediments, notably in the Quaternary interval, correspond to periods of enhanced winnowing by bottom currents. Significant changes in the rates of sediment accumulation and in the character and intensity of sediment bioturbation within and between sites probably reflect changes in calcareous biogenic productivity {{as a result of}} fundamental paleoceanographic events in the region during the Neogene. Burial lithification is expressed by a decrease in sediment porosity from about 70 to 45 % with depth. Concomitantly, microfossil preservation slowly deteriorates as a result of selective dissolution or recrystallization of some skeletons and the progressive appearance of secondary calcite overgrowths, first about discoasters and sphenoliths, and ultimately on portions of coccoliths. The ooze/chalk transition occurs at about 270 m sub-bottom depth at each of the northern sites (Sites 586 to 592) but is delayed until about twice this depth at the two southern sites (Sites 593 and 594). A possible explanation for this difference between geographic areas is the paucity of discoasters and sphenoliths at the southern sites; these nannofossil elements provide ideal nucleation sites for calcite overgrowths. Toward the bottom of some holes, dissolution seams and flasers appear in recrystallized chalks. The very minor terrigenous fraction of the sediment consists of silt- through clay-sized quartz, feldspar, mica, and clay minerals (smectite, illite, kaolinite, and chlorite), supplied as eolian dust from the Australian continent and by wind and ocean currents from erosion on South Island, New Zealand. Changes in the mass accumulation rates of terrigenous sediment and in clay mineral assemblages through time are related to various external controls, such as the continued northward drift of the Indo-Australian Plate, the development of Antarctic ice sheets, the increased desertification of the Australian continent after 14 m. y. ago, and the progressive increase in tectonic relief of New Zealand through the late Cenozoic. Disseminated glass shards and (altered) tephra layers occur in Leg 90 cores. They were derived from major silicic eruptions in North Island, New Zealand, and from <b>basic</b> to intermediate <b>explosive</b> volcanism along the Melanesian island chains. The tephrostratigraphic record suggests episodes of increased volcanicity in the southwest Pacific centered near 17, 13, 10, 5 and 1 m. y. ago, especially in the middle and early late Miocene. In addition, submarine basaltic volcanism was widespread in the southeast Tasman Sea around the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, possibly related to the propagation of the Southeast Indian Ridge through western New Zealand as a continental rift system...|$|R
