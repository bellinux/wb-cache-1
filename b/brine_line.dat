5000|$|In 2008, {{the city}} started up a {{desalination}} plant near the Oxnard Transit Center that treats the brackish groundwater from nearby wells. The water {{supply in the}} Oxnard Plain has been expanded by a $71 million Advanced Water Purification Facility (AWPF) built {{by the city of}} Oxnard. The plant scrubs treated sewage water to super-clean levels that can be used on crops, by industrial customers, and for water landscaping. The water can also be injected into the ground from where it can be pumped out months later for use in the drinking supply. When the final permits were in place, the AWPF began providing water to a lake at the River Ridge Golf Course in 2015. Water from the lake is used to irrigate the golf course. Pipelines in place were also ready to begin serving city parks, street landscaping, and all the landscaping in a large development of 1,800 homes along the Santa Clara River. The water is also provided to industrial customers and farmers near the plant but pipelines needed to reach additional farmers served by the Pleasant Valley County Water District with [...] will not be finished until 2016. The district is working to be able to temporarily use the <b>brine</b> <b>line</b> to get the water to the farmers as the drought continues.|$|E

Piping materials for geothermal systems have been of numerous types with great variation in cost and durability. The temperature and chemical quality of the geothermal fluids, in addition to cost, usually determine the type of piping network material used. In this paper, four suitable types of piping materials according to chemical quality and temperature of the fluid were taken into consideration for Meshkinshahr 50 MWe geothermal power plant pipelines. Pipelines consist of two lines that transport the mixture of brine and steam from wellhead to separators, two steam lines from separator to power house and two <b>brine</b> <b>lines</b> from separator to reinjection wellheads. The design parameters; number of expansion loops and legs, pressure drop, wall thickness, weight span. pipe weight and length of the pipe are variable with different pipe materials. Each parameter has a specific significance in each line. For example, in steam lines, pressure drop {{is more important than}} that in other lines and less pressure drop in steam lines lead to increase the inlet pressure of turbine and more output power. Also, these parameters directly affect the cost of piping, fewer expansion loops and legs lead to use less pipe length and less pressure drop, larger weight spans result in less pipe supporting costs, and different thicknesses make different pipe unit weight and different transportation costs. In this paper we tried to select pipe material for a 50 MWe geothermal power plant pipelines. ej 201...|$|R
40|$|Silica scale {{formation}} on the <b>brine</b> re-injection <b>lines</b> of geothermal power plants {{can lead to}} serious problems because it increased pressure drop and failure of the safety devices. One {{of the most effective}} methods to solve the problem is acidification of silica scaling using hydroflouric acid (HF). HF has a unique characteristic that is highly reactive with SiO 2, easily obtained in the market and cheap. The use of HF can increase the rate of material corrosion in re-injection lines material. The use of HF should be adjusted to the appropriate concentration so it can dissolve silica scale optimally without shortening its life service. The concentration of HF used in the experiment were 5, 10, and 15 % wt. The results showed that the optimum concentration of HF in dissolving silica at 15 %. This is due to its ability to dissolve the crust mostly greatest than most other concentration that is equal to 21 % of the total dissolved silica. The rate of corrosion on the material re-injection line with a concentration of 15 % is equal to 0. 647 mm/y and provide about 4. 63 years life time of pipe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Today Sweden has 341 {{ice hockey}} arenas, around 140 outdoor ice hockey rinks, 60 ice fields for bandy and about 35 curling arenas. In addition, {{the numbers of}} indoor bandy arenas are increasing. The cooling systems {{installed}} today {{should be able to}} lower its energy consumption with 10 - 30 %. In this thesis, Ronneby ice-arena has been researched. This artificial cooling facility was inaugurated 2011 {{and is one of the}} newest in Sweden. This is an outdoor ice field for bandy and therefor has no roof or walls to cover the field. Ronneby ice-arena has problems with uneven cooling distribution of the ice field. This results in cracks and uneven ice quality. These problems also result in higher energy consumption than necessary. To find a solution for the uneven cooling of the ice field flow measurements were carried out in the brine circuit. To get a better understanding of the cooling distribution, temperature measurements were carried out on the <b>brine</b> feeding <b>lines.</b> A calculation has been performed on what energy savings a speed control of the brine circulation pumps depending on the outdoor temperature could generate. Another calculation was made to see the possible savings with a windshield around the field. In this thesis the benefits of a heat recovery system on the cooling compressors refrigerant has been investigated. The heat recovery system could heat the locker rooms, the clubhouse, the showers and the hot water for the Zambonis. In order to perform the necessary calculation for this thesis, Fredriksbergs BK and Ronneby municipality provided operating data. The actions proposed to Ronneby ice-arena to solve the uneven cooling of the ice field is to change the location of the <b>brine</b> feeding <b>line</b> connection point. At the same time this work is carried out it’s suggested that the brine feed and return lines get insulated. When the uneven cooling problems have been solved, a speed control system should be installed to control the brine circulation pumps, in order to lower the electricity consumption. Ronneby ice-arena has the possibility to install a heat recovery system. Therefore it is suggested to install a heat exchanger on each cooling compressor refrigerant. This installation is to be used to heat the clubhouse, the showers and the hot water for the Zambonis. The system to cool the condensers with seawater and currently the heat pump are not optimal designed. The installed heat pump does not work when the seawater temperature is below 5 °C, therefore the system should be redesigned...|$|R

40|$|Using neutron scattering, we {{investigate}} the structure at local scale of very dilute solutions of a quasiternary surfactant system. For such systems consisting of surfactant and cosurfactant in <b>brine,</b> a critical <b>line</b> is {{often found in}} the very dilute range of the phase diagram where the L 3 sponge domain is continuously connected to the micellar domain. Our purpose {{is to examine the}} evolution of the morphology of the surfactant aggregates close to this critical line. Starting in the L 3 sponge domain and approaching the transition line, we find that the neutron scattering patterns deviate more and more from that of an infinite bilayer. Furthermore, far away {{on the other side of}} the critical line, the neutron scattering patterns reveal that the initial bilayers have been replaced by long 1 D cylindrical micelles. These findings are discussed in terms of the two different mechanisms that have been considered in the literature as being possibly at the origin of the critical behaviour: the symmetry breaking of the sponge and the spontaneous tearing of the bilayer...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Two cyclic {{peptides}} {{were isolated}} from the latex of Jatropha curcas L. (Figure 1), namely curcacycline A and B. In the past both compounds have not been fully structure elucidated, today modern structure elucidation has been applied by more sophisticated bioanalytical techniques. Additionally, {{for the first time}} the structure was confirmed by a full synthetic approach and biological assays have been carried out to shed light on the pharmacological activity of both curcacyclines. Screening of antibiotic activity of curcacycline A was done against Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphyloccus aureus ATCC 6538, Eschericia coli ATCC 8939, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 using paper disk diffussion method. Curcacycline A inhibited the growth of B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa with inhibition zone was ranged between 6. 5 – 10. 3 mm. Cytotoxic test show that it decreased the level of OVCAR 3 (ovarium cancer cell) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, while no effect was found on Colo 205 (human colon cancer cell). Curcacycline B did not have an effect on both cell <b>lines.</b> <b>Brine</b> shrimp cytotoxicity assay showed LD 50 of curcacycline A and B at 49. 85 µg/mL and 15. 84 µg/mL, respectively. Both curcacyclines did not have a mutagenic effect on Salmonella typhimurium TA- 98 and TA-mix (TA 7001, TA 7002, TA 7003, TA 7004, TA 7005, TA 7006). Industrial relevance. This study provides data on the safety as well the efficacy for curcacycline A and B. Curcacyline A possesses antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. Based on AMES II assay, curcacycline A and B were proven not to be mutagenic. Both curcacyclines also can be synthesized in the lab. These data will be essential to develop curcacyclines as a new drug candidate for managing infectious and cancer diseases. Keywords.

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} {{work on the}} stratigraphic {{record and}} fault pattern of the Hengelo brine field, {{little is known about}} the influence of the local fault population and characteristics of faults on salt cavern integrity. In this study a reconstruction of the fault population of the Hengelo brine field is made to assess its implications for sustainable underground storage (SUS) activities of AkzoNobel. To generate such a reconstruction the vast amount of 1 D well data of the brine field was used for the construction of thirty 2 D cross-sections of the subsurface. The sections were used as a tool to generate a fault displacement data set for several key geological horizons. This data set, in combination with a few structural constraints was used to reconstruct the fault pattern in three dimensions and to construct a conceptual model. The model formed the basis for the selection of potential areas suitable for sustainable underground storage. The reconstruction resulted in two new interpretations for the fault population and a dmax/L ratio of 0. 02 - 0. 03 comparable to the regional fault population. The first interpretation has a WNW-ESE fault trend throughout the <b>brine</b> field in <b>line</b> with the regional trend and the second interpretation has a deviating WSW-ENE fault trend in the north/northwest. The deviation is explained by releasing bends or steps in a NE-SW dextral strike-slip system. Occurrence of dextral strike-slip is in accordance with the regional Boekelo and Gronau Fault Zones. The conceptual model implies a tectonic regime that includes (dextral) strike-slip combined with extensional, compressional and synsedimentary tectonics. It resulted in a WSW-ENE trending depression in the north/northwest which deviates from the WNW-ESE trend in the south/southwest. Uplift led to erosion of several formations and inversion tilted the area. Three stable areas were selected and caverns with potential risk were identified. The caverns that remained are stable candidates for sustainable underground storage in a geological sense. However, several still need to reach the appropriate volume to comply for storage...|$|R
