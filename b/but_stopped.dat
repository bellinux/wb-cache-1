Brown and Company, $2,200 {{to produce the}} first edition. The printer began work in September 1874, <b>but</b> <b>stopped</b> {{whenever}} the advance payment ran out, so progress was slow. The book—Science and Health by Mary Baker Glover, with eight chapters and 456 pages—finally appeared on October 30, 1875, published {{in the name of}} the Christian Science Publishing Company.|$|E
5|$|Planning of the {{extension}} of the suburban light rail Holmenkollen Line to the city center started in 1901. Construction began in 1912, <b>but</b> <b>stopped</b> again in 1914 because the municipality and the company could not agree on the location of the terminal station. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien. The following year, the municipality launched a contest to make the best suggestion for the tram networks. It took five years to select a winner, and this allowed the municipality and company to make a compromise by locating the terminus at Nationaltheatret. But not until 1926 was permission granted for the station. Construction commenced and the station and tunnel opened in 1928.|$|E

5|$|Sjumandjaja {{was born}} in Batavia on 5 August 1934. The fifth of eight children, Sjumandjaja was ethnically Javanese but soon became {{accustomed}} to the local Betawi culture. He studied Quran reading {{for a period of}} three days, <b>but</b> <b>stopped</b> after numerous disagreements with the teacher. When he was ten years old, his father died, leaving Sjumandjaja to be raised by his mother. During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies from 1942 to 1945, he witnessed several forced labourers being beaten to death near his home during the construction of Kemayoran Airport.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad was {{completed}} between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia in 1854. During the 1880s, the South Pennsylvania Railroad was proposed {{to compete with}} the Pennsylvania. It received the backing of William Henry Vanderbilt, head of the New York Central Railroad (the Pennsylvania's chief rival). Andrew Carnegie also provided financial support, since he was unhappy with rates charged by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Construction began on the rival line in 1883, <b>but</b> <b>stopped</b> when the railroads reached an agreement in 1885. After construction halted, the only vestiges of the South Pennsylvania were nine tunnels, some roadbed and piers for a bridge over the Susquehanna River in Harrisburg.|$|E
5|$|The layer pyramid {{was first}} {{examined}} and its surroundings explored in 1839 by John Shae Perring. Soon after, in 1848, the pyramid {{was identified as}} such by Karl Richard Lepsius, who listed it as number XIV in his pioneering list of pyramids. Around 40 years later, in 1886, Gaston Maspero unsuccessfully searched for {{the entrance of the}} subterranean passages of the pyramid, which was discovered in 1896 by Jacques de Morgan. The latter undertook excavations of the pyramid <b>but</b> <b>stopped</b> after clearing the first few steps of the descending stairway.|$|E

5|$|After {{two years}} of {{intensive}} work Lissitzky was taken ill with acute pneumonia in October 1923. A few weeks later {{he was diagnosed with}} pulmonary tuberculosis; in February 1924 he relocated to a Swiss sanatorium near Locarno. He kept very busy during his stay, working on advertisement designs for Pelikan Industries (who in turn paid for his treatment), translating articles written by Malevich into German, and experimenting heavily in typographic design and photography. In 1925, after the Swiss government denied his request to renew his visa, Lissitzky returned to Moscow and began teaching interior design, metalwork, and architecture at VKhUTEMAS (State Higher Artistic and Technical Workshops), a post he would keep until 1930. He all <b>but</b> <b>stopped</b> his Proun works and became increasingly active in architecture and propaganda designs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{volcanic}} eruptions in Hawaiʻi rarely produce casualties (the only direct historical fatality due to volcanic {{activity on the}} island occurred at Kīlauea in 1924, when an unusually explosive eruption hurled rocks at an onlooker), property damage due to inundation by lava is a common and costly hazard. Hawaiian-type eruptions usually produce extremely slow-moving flows that advance at walking pace, presenting little danger to human life, {{but this is not}} strictly the case; Mauna Loa's 1950 eruption emitted as much lava in three weeks as Kīlauea's current eruption produces in three years and reached sea level within four hours of its start, overrunning the village of Hoʻokena Mauka and a major highway on the way there. An earlier eruption in 1926 overran the village of Hoʻōpūloa Makai, and Hilo, partly built on lavas from the 1880–81 eruption, is at risk from future eruptions. The 1984 eruption nearly reached the city, <b>but</b> <b>stopped</b> short after the flow was redirected upstream.|$|E
5|$|Campus {{newspapers}} {{include the}} independent student newspaper, The BG News, published since 1920. It {{was known as}} the Bee Gee News before assuming its current name on September 21, 1951. The paper is available for free at 135 newsstands. In 2009 the paper became available on a web portal known as BG Views. The paper prints 7,000 copies of the paper Monday through Friday during the fall and spring semesters, and on Wednesday during the summer. The university's independent, student operated yearbook was first published in 1918 <b>but</b> <b>stopped</b> after one edition for six years. In 1924 it resumed production and was published every year as a record of students, activities, and events for a given year. In 2008, the yearbook was replaced with a magazine format, The Key Magazine, and is published semi-annually, in fall and spring semesters.|$|E

5|$|Controversy over Kampoeng Rawa had {{developed}} by late 2012, when the Water Resource Management Agency {{declared that the}} site was illegally located in the green belt around Lake Rawa Pening. In 2013, the ecologist Sudharto of Diponegoro University stated that the area around Rawa Pening had to be clear of all buildings, otherwise the water flow and ecosystem would be disturbed. It was {{also found that the}} permits for the establishment had not been obtained. However, the Regent of Semarang, Sudharto, was supportive of Kampoeng Rawa, stating that the complex not only improved the welfare of the farmers and fishermen, <b>but</b> <b>stopped</b> feuds over the use of rice paddies in the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2004, Meissner began working on a triple Axel <b>but</b> <b>stopped</b> {{practicing}} the jump for two months due to a slight back injury. She moved up to the senior level nationally but remained a junior internationally. She was practicing four to five hours on most days. On the 2004–05 ISU Junior Grand Prix series, the first season the ISU Judging System was being used in junior competition, she won silver medals at the event in Courchevel, France and a second silver medal at the event in Long Beach, California. Meissner's two silver medals qualified her for the Junior Grand Prix Final in Helsinki, Finland, where she won the bronze medal, after placing seventh in the short program and second in the free skate.|$|E
5|$|McCabe ran for an {{administrative}} position with his local club Mosman after his retirement, but was defeated, so {{he never had}} an opportunity to serve with the NSWCA. After the end of his first-class career, McCabe became a keen recreational golfer, <b>but</b> <b>stopped</b> playing in the mid-1950s due to his foot problems and other health issues. In 195657, McCabe and O'Reilly were given a testimonial match by the New South Wales Cricket Association. The match was between Harvey's XI and Lindwall's XI and acted as a trial for the non-Test tour of New Zealand. The match raised 7,500 pounds, which was split between McCabe and O'Reilly, and would have bought two average-sized homes in Sydney at the time.|$|E

5|$|On July 26, the Foch Line was {{accepted}} by the Conference of Ambassadors as the provisional border between the two states. Lithuanians were not informed about this decision until August 3. Neither country was satisfied: both Lithuanian and Polish forces would have to retreat from the Suwałki and Vilnius regions, respectively. Those Germans still present in the region also objected to the boundary of the line. The Lithuanian forces (about 350 strong) left the town of Suwałki by August 7, <b>but</b> <b>stopped</b> in Sejny and formed a line at the Czarna Hańcza river – Wigry Lake. Lithuanians believed that the Foch Line was not the final decision, {{and that they had}} the duty to protect Lithuanian outposts in the region.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, May 24, {{they set}} out again, <b>but</b> <b>stopped</b> for breakfast after about three miles. As they {{finished}} eating, about 30 warriors approached. The men retreated, but four were shot and killed. Slain with St. Vrain were John Fowler, William Hale, and Aaron Hawley. An account of the massacre from Gen. George W. Jones, who was St. Vrain's brother-in-law {{and the man who}} identified his body, said the warriors had scalped the dead men, but also cut off the hands, head, and feet of St. Vrain and removed his heart. They reportedly passed around pieces of the heart for the braves to eat. At least one source indicated that the mutilation began before St. Vrain was dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{extending}} the Holmenkollen Line from Majorstuen {{to the city}} center had started in 1901. The process had been delayed several times because of disagreements between {{the city and the}} company, in part because the two could not agree if it should be classified as a railway or a tramway. Construction started in 1912, <b>but</b> <b>stopped</b> again in 1914 because the municipality and the company could not agree on the location of the terminus. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien, but this would make it difficult for the company to build the tunnel through the city center to connect to the suburban tramways east of the city center. Construction was stopped in October 1914.|$|E

5|$|Two manga adaptations were {{published}} by ASCII Media Works in Dengeki Daioh and Dengeki Maoh. Between 2005 and 2012, {{the series was}} adapted by J.C.Staff into three 24-episode anime television series, a four-episode original video animation (OVA) series, an animated film and an additional stand alone OVA episode. A PlayStation 2 video game was released in March 2006, and it was ported to the Nintendo DS in March 2007. Viz Media licensed the novels and the first manga series for release in North America, <b>but</b> <b>stopped</b> publishing both prematurely. Geneon originally licensed the first television series for release in North America, but the license later transferred to Funimation, who also licensed the remaining anime properties. Critics praised the series for its execution of typical story elements and how it continuously becomes better over time. However, the series is described as having issues with pacing.|$|E
5|$|Under Mohammad Daoud Khan's prime ministership, {{suppression}} of radicals was common. However, {{because of his}} language skills, Taraki {{was sent to the}} Afghan Embassy in the United States in 1952. Within several months Taraki began denouncing the Afghan government under King Zahir Shah and accused it of being autocratic and dictatorial. His denunciation of the Afghan government earned him much publicity in the United States. It also attracted unfavorable attention from authorities back home, who relieved him of his post and ordered him repatriated <b>but</b> <b>stopped</b> short of placing him under arrest. After a short period of unemployment Taraki started working for the United States Overseas Mission in Kabul as an interpreter. He quit that job in 1958 and established his own translation company, the Noor Translation Bureau. Four years later, he started working for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, but quit in 1963 to focus on the establishment of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), a communist political party.|$|E
