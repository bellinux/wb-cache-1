40|$|Presented is a {{statistical}} analysis of vertically-polarised bistatic sea clutter data, with bistatic angles ranging from 30 ° to 90 °, compared with simultaneously-gathered monostatic clutter data. It is found {{that there is no}} significant change in the <b>bistatic</b> <b>reflectivity</b> compared to the monostatic except close to bistatic angles of 90 °. It is found that the shape parameter of the K-distribution fitted to the clutter is significantly higher for the bistatic clutter than for the equivalent monostatic clutter. W. A. Al-Ashwal, C. J.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} of an experimental program {{to determine the}} functional dependence of the microwave reflectivity of nonvegetated soil surfaces upon volumetric soil moisture and matric potential. A combination evaporation-drainage field experiment was conducted on a bare Captina slit loam with reflectivity, soil moisture content, and matric potential monitored for extended time periods. Results show that for a restricted pressure range (approximately - 0. 05 to - 0. 75 bar) there is excellent linear correlation between the log of <b>bistatic</b> <b>reflectivity</b> and both volumetric moisture content and matric potential. Layering effects due to steep moisture content (and matric potential) gradients in the profile are demonstrated to have two distinct and significant effects on the reflectivity response. At near saturation of rough surfaces a very thin dry surface layer appears to modify the effective roughness. This leads to a saturation of reflectivity at high moisture contents. As the surface proceeds to dry further, deeper layers produce coherent interference patterns in the reflectivity response, particularly at the higher frequencies...|$|E
40|$|A {{bistatic}} {{synthetic aperture}} radar uses a separated transmitter and receiver flying on different platforms to achieve benefits like exploitation of additional information contained in the <b>bistatic</b> <b>reflectivity</b> of targets, reduced vulnerability for military applications, forward looking SAR imaging or increased RCS. A particular constellation, where the transmitter is in space and the receiver near or on the earth surface (e. g. aircraft, tower) is called a hybrid bistatic SAR system. Besides technical challenges, like the synchronization of transmitter and receiver, the overlap of the two antenna footprints is of vital importance. Due to the extreme platform velocity differences, SAR modes with flexible steering of the antenna beams are necessary. The sliding spotlight mode offers such a beam steering, where the antenna footprint velocity can be chosen slower or faster than the platform velocity. If both transmitter and receiver use this mode it is called double sliding spotlight mode, which will be investigated in this paper using {{the example of the}} satellite TerraSAR-X and the airborne SAR system PAMIR. Several aspects like the ground resolution, Doppler frequency and Doppler-bandwidth will be analyzed...|$|E
40|$|The {{empirical}} {{results of}} a global navigation satellite systems reflectometry (GNSS-R) experiment onboard the Balloon EXperiments for University Students (BEXUS) 17 stratospheric balloon performed north of Sweden over boreal forests show {{that the power of}} the reflected signals is nearly independent of the platform height for a high coherent integration time T-c = 20 ms. This experimental evidence shows a strong coherent component in the forward scattered signal, as compared with the incoherent component, that allows to be tracked. The <b>bistatic</b> coherent <b>reflectivity</b> is also evaluated {{as a function of the}} elevation angle, showing a decrease of similar to 6 dB when the elevation angle increases from 35. to 70 degrees. The received power presents a clearly multimodal behavior, which also suggests that the coherent scattering component may be taking place in different forest elements, i. e., soil, canopy, and through multiple reflections canopy-soil and soil-trunk. This experiment has provided the first GNSS-R data set over boreal forests. The evaluation of these results can be useful for the feasibility study of this technique to perform biomass monitoring that is a key factor to analyze the carbon cycle.

40|$|Bistatic Doppler radar {{networks}} have become {{in the last}} five years a viable and inexpensive alternative to multiple-Doppler networks. Operational experience with a bistatic network at McGill University showed many cases in which data quality seemed heavily affected. Study of those situations suggested sidelobe contamination from the transmitter antenna pattern to be the principal cause. To confirm these findings a sidelobe simulation model (SISI model) was constructed. Comparison between simulations and actual data showed a good reproduction of the observed effect. It is also shown that this effect may have damaging consequences in Doppler fields in both convective and stratiform precipitation events. An index of contamination that can be obtained either with the SISI model or directly using the <b>reflectivity</b> <b>bistatic</b> data is introduced to detect areas of low quality data. Recommendations for the effective use of bistatic data are presented. These findings are taken into account when the optimization of the layout of a bistatic network is analyzed. Sidelobe contamination was found to be a serious problem irrespective of the receiver's location. More than one passive receiver increases the extent of the dual Doppler area but unfortunately does not significantly reduce the problem of sidelobe contamination within a predetermined area. A rule-of-thumb for the deployment of a bistatic network is presented. Some suggestions for improvements of the network are given...|$|R
40|$|This thesis focuses upon {{automatic}} target recognition (ATR) with radar sensors. Recent advancements in ATR {{have included}} the processing of target signatures from multiple, spatially-diverse perspectives. The advantage of multiple perspectives in target classification results from the angular sensitivity of reflected radar transmissions. By viewing the target at different angles, the classifier has a better opportunity to distinguish between target classes. This dissertation extends recent advances in multi-perspective target classification by: 1) leveraging <b>bistatic</b> target <b>reflectivity</b> signatures observed from multiple, spatially-diverse radar sensors; and, 2) employing a statistical distance measure to identify radar sensor locations yielding improved classification rates. The algorithms provided in this thesis use high resolution range (HRR) profiles – formed by each participating radar sensor – as input to a multi-sensor classification algorithm derived using the fundamentals of statistical signal processing. Improvements to target classification rates are demonstrated for multiple configurations of transmitter, receiver, and target locations. These improvements are shown to emanate from the multi-static characteristics of a target class’ range profile and not merely from non-coherent gain. The significance of dominant scatterer reflections is revealed in both classification performance and the “statistical distance” between target classes. Numerous simulations have been performed to interrogate the robustness of the derived classifier. Errors in target pose angle and the inclusion of camouflage, concealment, and deception (CCD) effects are considered in assessing {{the validity of the}} classifier. Consideration of different transmitter and receiver combinations and low signal-to-noise ratios are analyzed in the context of deterministic, Gaussian, and uniform target pose uncertainty models. Performance metrics demonstrate increases in classification rates of up to 30 % for multiple-transmit, multiple-receive platform configurations when compared to multi-sensor monostatic configurations. A distance measure between probable target classes is derived using information theoretic techniques pioneered by Kullback and Leibler. The derived measure is shown to suggest radar sensor placements yielding better target classification rates. The predicted placements consider two-platform and three-platform configurations in a single-transmit, multiple-receive environment. Significant improvements in classification rates are observed when compared to ad-hoc sensor placement. In one study, platform placements identified by the distance measure algorithm are shown to produce classification rates exceeding 98. 8 % of all possible platform placements. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of wind vectors derived from bistatic dual-Doppler synthesis was investigated. The investigation {{was based on}} mathematical examinations and observation data analyses in both convective and stratiform cases. Accurate wind vectors were calculated within a range of 408, b, 1508, where b was the bistatic scatter angle. The accuracy is mainly governed by b as the first principle, while sidelobe contamination and {{the sensitivity of the}} low-gain bistatic antenna are practically the main obstacles in retrieving accurate wind fields in convective and stratiform echoes, respectively. The sidelobe contamination around strong convective echoes with large gradients of reflectivity can be eliminated by comparing the measured <b>bistatic</b> <b>reflectivity</b> and a clean bistatic radar reflectivity, which is derived from the measured transmitting radar reflectivity and a bistatic radar equation. The radar equation includes the bistatic resolution volume and a bistatic antenna pattern estimated by the long-time observation of stratiform echoes. The equation also leads to the distribution of minimum detectable re-flectivity of the bistatic receiver. The multiple bistatic radar observation in stratiform echoes produced three kinds of horizontal wind vectors, which were almost coincident with each other, in the overdetermined region. The composite wind fields are calculated by a simple variational method. 1...|$|E
