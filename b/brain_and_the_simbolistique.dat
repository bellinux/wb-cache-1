40|$|Exposure of rats to {{hypobaric}} {{stress for}} periods {{of up to}} 36 h caused a consistent change in the succinate-NT reductase activity of the heart mitochondria whereas {{there was no significant}} change in the activities of either succinate dehydrogenase and succinate-NT reductase of <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> kidney. Mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase of <b>the</b> heart, <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> kidney was activated 2 - to 7 -fold with <b>the</b> substrate <b>and</b> malonate. <b>The</b> activations obtained with oxalate, citrate and dinitrophenol were relatively lower in comparison to succinate and malonate. Benzohydroquinone and 2 -nitrophenol had no stimulatory effect on <b>the</b> heart, <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> kidney mitochondria. THE ACTIVATIONS OBTAINED WITH THE VARIOUS EFFECTORS PARTIALLY (OR COMPLETELY IN THE CASE OF SUCCINATE) REVERSED ON WASHING THE MITOCHONDRIAL SAMPLES WITH THE SUCROSE HOMOGENIZING MEDIUM. The effect of ubiquinol, which also activated the enzyme, was only partially reversed after the second preincubation with succinate in <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> kidney whereas in the heart the activity was fully reversed. The increased activity of succinate dehydrogenase obtained with ATP and ADP was further enhanced by Mg 2 + exclusively in the brain mitochondria, suggesting the possibility of Mg 2 +-AIP complex as the active species.
