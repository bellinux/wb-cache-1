50|$|The <b>black-fronted</b> <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops minor) is a {{songbird}} species. It {{is closely}} related to the Old World babblers, and its family Zosteropidae might better be included in the Tiimalidae. Some sources include this species within Z. atrifrons, the black-crowned white-eye.|$|E
50|$|It was {{formerly}} considered conspecific with <b>black-fronted</b> <b>white-eye,</b> Zosterops minor, but work by Pamela C. Rasmussen {{and her colleagues}} showed {{that it is a}} separate species. The same research also confirmed the specific status of the Sangihe white-eye, Zosterops nehrkorni.|$|E
50|$|The black-crowned white-eye (Zosterops atrifrons) is a {{songbird}} species. It {{is closely}} related to the Old World babblers, and its family Zosteropidae might better be included in the Tiimalidae. Its subspecies from the Sulawesi region might warrant recognition as distinct species Z. subatrifrons. The Sangihe white-eye (Z. nehrkorni) and the Seram white-eye (Z. stalkeri) were formerly included in Z. atrifrons, as is still, on occasion, the <b>black-fronted</b> <b>white-eye</b> (Z. minor).|$|E
50|$|The Bismarck white-eye or black-headed white-eye (Zosterops hypoxanthus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Zosteropidae. It is endemic to the Bismarck Archipelago in Papua New Guinea, where is occurs in New Britain, New Ireland {{and a number of}} smaller islands. It is {{sometimes}} considered to be the same species as the <b>black-fronted</b> <b>white-eye</b> of the mainland of New Guinea. The species is found in forests, forest edges, secondary forest, gardens and plantations, generally in hill and mountain areas and more rarely down to sea level.|$|E
