25|$|In Europe, William Addis of England is {{believed}} to have produced the first mass produced toothbrush in 1780. In 1770, he had been jailed for causing a riot. While in prison he decided that using a rag with soot and salt on the teeth was ineffective and could be improved. After saving a small bone from a meal, he drilled small holes into the bone and tied into the bone tufts of bristles that he had obtained from one of the guards, passed the tufts of bristle through the holes in the bone and sealed the holes with glue. After his release, he became wealthy after starting a business manufacturing toothbrushes. He died in 1808, bequeathing the business to his eldest son. It remained within family ownership until 1996. Under the name Wisdom Toothbrushes, the company now manufactures 70 million toothbrushes per year in the UK. By 1840 toothbrushes were being mass produced in England, France, Germany, and Japan. Pig bristles were used for cheaper toothbrushes and <b>badger</b> <b>hair</b> for the more expensive ones.|$|E
50|$|Pure badger are <b>badger</b> <b>hair</b> brushes {{that use}} the most common hair from the underbelly of a badger, the hair which covers around 60% of a badger's body. This hair varies greatly in softness, {{pliability}} and color. Pure <b>badger</b> <b>hair</b> is usually dark in color, but fluctuates from a light tan to a near-black or silvery sheen. The hair is coarser than 'best' or 'silvertip' hair due to its larger shaft. Brushes made exclusively with pure <b>badger</b> <b>hair</b> cost significantly less than finer <b>badger</b> <b>hair.</b> Most often, pure badger brush hairs are trimmed to shape, resulting in somewhat stiff, rough ends.|$|E

40|$|The <b>badger’s</b> <b>hair</b> {{is black}} and white leading to a grey {{appearance}} from the distance. They have a black chest and forepaws with prominent black and white striped head with white tipped ears. Their head is small, with small eyes, thick short neck and a long body with a short tail. They grow up to 30 inches from head to tail and can weigh up to 8 – 12 kilograms. Males are slightly bigger than the females. Males are called boars. Females are called sows. Badgers are fierce animals and will protect themselves and their young at all costs, and are capable of fighting off much larger animals. Habitat Many factors affect where a badger can live including geology, altitude, inclination and orientation of slopes. Some of the ecological requirements that must be fulfilled in a badgers location include: adequate food supply available during all seasons, sufficient cover to allow unnoticed emergence from setts and a location free from disturbance. When building their setts badgers often utilize areas of sandy soils in preference to clay as this soil is easier to dig and also drains easier. Sometimes sandy soils can be prone to roof collapse, therefore badgers choose areas that help consolidate the material such as digging into roots of trees and hedges. The badger lives in large underground tunnel systems called setts. There are usually 3 to 10 entrances to these setts, which are much larger than rabbit holes and oval in shape. The setts are comprised of a huge system of tunnels and chambers. Badgers can inherit their setts, therefore these setts can be very old, in some cases centuries old. The setts have one chamber for breeding and several sleeping chambers. At certain points the passage widens, to allow the badgers to pass each other. They keep their setts very clean compared to other animals like the fox and change or air the bedding several times a year. Airing the bedding also serves to kill the parasites in the bedding. Badgers are very territorial. The boundaries of the territory are usually outlined by well-worn paths. They mark these paths with scenting. Like all Mustelids, badgers secrete a very odorous scent from their subcaudal glands...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Badger</b> <b>hair</b> brushes come in {{a variety}} of grades, but there is not an {{industry}} standard that specifically defines grades of <b>badger</b> <b>hair.</b> Generally speaking, though, there are basic classifications that many manufacturers use to describe the quality of hair used in their brushes. The most common gradations of <b>badger</b> <b>hair</b> are [...] "pure" [...] badger, [...] "best" [...] badger, and [...] "super" [...] or [...] "silvertip" [...] badger. While some companies insist on using other gradations (for example, Vulfix's high-end brushes distinguish between [...] "super" [...] and [...] "silvertip"), these three are commonly accepted among wet shavers and are most often used to describe the quality of a shave brush.|$|E
50|$|Boar {{bristles}} {{are available}} cheaply from many sources. Brushes made in China or India with boar bristle are supplied wholesale, while even the cheapest wholesale Badger brush costs at least $10; even the cost difference between badger brushes with resin handles vs. expensive horn handles shows that, except with exotic {{materials such as}} sterling silver, special woods, ivory, bone or custom materials, <b>badger</b> <b>hair</b> is the costliest element of a brush. It is common for boar-hair brushes to have part of the bristles dyed to resemble <b>badger</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Charivari (pronounced [...] "schariwari") is a {{piece of}} {{traditional}} Bavarian costume jewellery made of solid silver or of rare silver-plated chain, adorned with trinkets, gemstone, coins (or possibly medals), horn discs, carved deer teeth, antlers, animal paws, <b>badger</b> <b>hair,</b> or other game teeth.|$|E
50|$|Boar's {{hair brushes}} are {{relatively}} inexpensive, {{but can be}} of very high quality. A well-made boar brush will break in with use; the bristles begin to split at their tips, resulting in a brush that is very soft but has considerable backbone. Unlike <b>badger</b> <b>hair</b> and synthetic fibers, boar bristles absorb water, so the brush should be soaked before use.|$|E
5000|$|Silvertip badger is {{the most}} {{expensive}} and rare type of <b>badger</b> <b>hair.</b> The tips on this hair appear white naturally, without bleaching. A [...] "flared" [...] bristle load results in the 'silvertip' brush's fluffy appearance and lends the brush its ability to hold a large amount of water. Due to its water retention capacity, a 'silvertip' brush can create well-formed shaving lather quickly and easily.|$|E
50|$|Because badgers are a {{protected}} species in North America {{and most of}} Europe, virtually all commercial <b>badger</b> <b>hair</b> comes from mainland China, which supplies knots of hair in various grades to brush makers in both China and Europe. In rural Northern China, badgers multiply {{to the point of}} becoming a crop nuisance, and village cooperatives are licensed by the national government to hunt badgers and sell the hair to processors.|$|E
50|$|He overcame {{a lifelong}} fear of badgers in April 2017 by {{employing}} the controversial Hausller 'wild mammal submersion method' and actually {{lived with a}} family of badgers underground in a small woodland in Bedfordshire for ten days. Kay claims the experience was successful and now campaigns on behalf of badgers and can often be seen demonstrating outside old fashioned barber shops who use the traditional <b>badger</b> <b>hair</b> shaving brush.|$|E
50|$|One way to {{determine}} if a brush bears a 'super' or 'silvertip' <b>badger</b> <b>hair</b> load {{is to look at the}} color of the bristle tips. A true 'silvertip' brush has tips that are an off-white. A 'super' brush on the other hand has bristle tips that are a more sterile, slightly greyed white; moreover, the light color of the tips does not extend as far down the shaft of the hair.|$|E
50|$|Best badger are brushes {{made with}} the finer and more pliable hairs from 20 - 25% of the badger's body. It is longer in length and lighter in color than 'pure' <b>badger</b> <b>hair.</b> A 'best' badger brush is more densely filled with hair than the 'pure' badger brush and will produce a {{correspondingly}} greater lather. However, some wet shavers argue that the variance between {{the quality of a}} 'pure' and a 'best' badger brush is negligible. Best badger and better quality brush hairs are often fit so that the ends {{do not have to be}} cut to shape.|$|E
50|$|The badger {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} and iconic animals in Britain. Most people recognise badgers by their black- and white striped head, but because they are nocturnal mammals, they are rarely seen. They do, however, roam onto Gillies Hill and signs of badger activity (heavily worn badger paths with distinctive 5-toed footprints, claw marks on trees, dung pits and coarse, wiry <b>badger</b> <b>hair</b> caught on the barbs of wire fences) have been documented. In the winter of 2011 a badger was photographed on the hill with a hidden wildlife camera. The largest threat to badgers on Gillies Hill - outside of potential quarrying and development - is the traffic that travels along Polmaise Road.|$|E
50|$|The hair of the European badger {{has been}} used for centuries for making sporrans and high end shaving brushes. Sporrans are {{traditionally}} worn as part of male Scottish highland dress. They form a bag or pocket made from a pelt and a badger or other animal's mask may be used as a flap. Compared to the fur of other animals, badger's hair is ideal for shaving brushes because it retains the hot water that needs to be applied to the skin while wet shaving. Although some brushes are made from wild <b>badger</b> <b>hair,</b> most hair is sourced from China where badgers are farmed for this purpose. The pelt was also formerly used for pistol furniture.|$|E
50|$|Badgers {{have been}} trapped commercially for their pelts, {{which have been}} used for centuries to make shaving brushes, a purpose to which it is {{particularly}} suited owing to its high water retention. Virtually all commercially available <b>badger</b> <b>hair</b> now comes from mainland China, though, which has farms for the purpose. The Chinese supply three grades of hair to domestic and foreign brush makers. Village cooperatives are also licensed by the national government to hunt and process badgers to avoid their becoming a crop nuisance in rural northern China. The European badger is also used as trim for some traditional Scottish clothing. The American badger is also used for paintbrushes and as trim for some Native American garments. It has also been occasionally used for doll hair.|$|E
50|$|A shave brush's {{price is}} usually {{determined}} more by its bristle load {{than any other}} factor except for brushes with very exotic handles. The most expensive brushes often use exotic materials in the handle. The bristles are fixed together into a knot that is installed into the handle. The best quality brushes are hand knotted. Badger and boar brushes are the most commonly found animals used for shaving brush fibers. Badger species include the eurasian badger and the hog badger. Badger brushes and {{often referred to as}} two band, or three band. Perhaps all <b>badger</b> <b>hair</b> fibers have three bands, but those used in the brushes conceal the lighter bottom band. Nonetheless, both types of bristle make desirable shaving brushes. Lower-quality brushes are often machine made and the bristles may be trimmed, resulting in sharp, prickly tips.|$|E
5000|$|The modern {{shaving brush}} may {{be traced to}} France during the 1750s. The French call a shaving brush blaireau or [...] "badger." [...] Quality of these brushes {{differed}} greatly, as materials used to fashion the handles varied from the common to the exotic. It was not uncommon for handles {{to be made of}} ivory, gold, silver, tortoise shell, crystal, or porcelain. The more expensive brushes used <b>badger</b> <b>hair,</b> with cheaper ones using boar's or horse's hair. In the 1800s when the folding-handle straight razor design made it practical for men to shave themselves rather than visit a barber, a shave brush became a status symbol, and an expensive or eccentric brush was a way of asserting one's personality or even affluence. The recent rapid rise in the popularity of [...] "wet shaving" [...] has raised demand for high quality and custom shaving brushes.|$|E

40|$|The Eurasian badger (Meles meles) is {{included}} in Appendix III of the Bern Convention and protected by national laws in many European countries. <b>Badger</b> <b>hair</b> is used to manufacture luxury shaving brushes, although it is frequently argued that the hog badger (Arctonyx collaris), which in Europe is an introduced and unprotected species, is {{the origin of the}} hair used. We applied an extraction protocol to recover DNA from the unrooted hair of shaving brushes obtained from commercial companies in The Netherlands and Spain. The tested brushes originated from The Netherlands, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom where the Eurasian badger is a protected species. We sequenced 191 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control region and 170 bp of the cytochrome b gene and compared the sequences obtained with Eurasian badger and hog badger reference sequences of the same mitochondrial DNA regions obtained in our laboratory and from GenBank. Sequences obtained from four shaving brushes were clearly hog badger sequences, whereas four sequences clustered with Eurasian badger sequences of both European and Asian origins. One of the shaving brushes made of Eurasian badger was produced in France, where it is legal to capture or trade the species under certain conditions. The remaining three brushes originated from The Netherlands, where it is illegal to possess, sell, transport or use for commercial purposes dead Eurasian badgers or products derived from them.
