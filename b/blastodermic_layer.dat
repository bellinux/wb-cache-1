40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{compares the}} differentiation and migration potential {{as well as}} the functional behaviour of human bone marrow- and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells on three dimensional collagen scaffolds during osteogenic induction. We could draw conclusions from the in vitro characteristics of the stem cell-biomaterial-hybrids as to the in vivo integration of both stem cell types in human tissue. Both the perinatal and adult bone marrow stem cells exhibited all characteristics of mature osteoblasts, as it could be demonstrated by histology, immunhistochemistry, electron microscopy and molecular biology via RT-PCR. However, the BM-hMSC showed a stronger osteogenic transformation under two-dimensional culture conditions, whereas the UC-hMSC with contact to the collagenous matrix were superior to extracellular mineralisation and synthesis of extracellular matrix. In addition the UC-hMSC just like the BM-hMSC are able to boost fracture healing comparable with in vivo osteoblasts by the MMP-mediated migration and the associated colonization of the collagen scaffolds and by their great contractive potential. Insofar the mesenchymal stem cells from the umbilical cord will play a decisive role in the field of bone reconstruction in future. In order to realize their commitment not only in the field of mesodermal but also ectodermal tissues in long term, we tried to induce a differentiation of the UC-hMSC beyond the <b>blastodermic</b> <b>layer.</b> Therefore we cultivated the mesenchymal stem cells with air contact on dermal equivalents composed of collagen I/III with fibroblasts under epidermal differentiation stimuli. After isolation nearly 10 % of the stem cells expressed the epithelial marker pan-cytoceratin, while this proportion increased to more than 30 % after 21 days of three-dimensional culture conditions of skin, but after osteogenic stimulation there was no expression detectable. This underlinded the influence of the culture conditions. But except for the concomitant coexpression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin a complete epidermal differentiation of umbilical cord stem cells could also be refuted by the missing epithelial stratification and expression of further markers typical of epithel. The pan-cytokeratin- expression {{can be attributed to the}} transformation of the UC-hMSC in myofibroblasts, which could be supported by their alpha-SMA-positivity and typical morphology in electron microscopy, the synthesis of extracellular matrix and their characteristic functional behaviour in terms of a collagen contraction. There were no significant changes concerning differentiation in cells of epidermis respectively myofibroblasts detectable under modification of the culture conditions with 5 -azacytidin and all-trans-retinoic acid. Nevertheless mesenchymal stem cells from umbilical cord will play a major role in the near future in the field of wound healing and therapy of hereditary dermatosis because of their differentiation in myofibroblasts and their great capacity of synthesis...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} fast and easy isolation of cells via trypsin digestion from larvae of Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus resulting in a stable, well-proliferating cell culture. The culture conditions for these cells were optimized {{with the aim of}} supporting the production of high amounts of biomass. To enhance cell growth and cell density, 4 different cultivation temperatures as well as commercially available carp serum (CS) and fetal calf serum (FCS) at different concentrations were tested and evaluated. Cell growth was measured via an impedance-based online cell-monitoring system (xCELLigence). These results showed the best cultivation temperature to be at 25 C and a media composition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with either 10 or 20 % FCS or 5 % CS. The cells were stable in the process of long-term cultivation over 33 passages and could be cryo-preserved. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the cells expressed proteins of different <b>blastodermic</b> <b>layers.</b> Ectodermic glia fibrilliary acid protein, vigilin (mRNA transport protein), and pan cytokeratin were abundant. This fast-growing cell culture provides an important tool for research on Atlantic sturgeon populations...|$|R
