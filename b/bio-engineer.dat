Discovering Jason has been captured by a <b>bio-engineer</b> named Kristen, Pamela releases him and guides him to a camp near Kristen's laboratory populated by androids, who Jason begins to destroy, quickly becoming disastified with these victims due to the fact that, as Pamela states, [...] "they aren't real." [...] At the end of the comic, Pamela, after Jason is launched into space by Kristen, gets revenge on the <b>bio-engineer</b> by possessing her lover Neil and forcing him to stab Kristen in the stomach and slit his own throat. In the sequel to the one-shot, the two-issue miniseries Friday the 13th: Jason vs. Jason X, Pamela appears only as a fragmented memory shared between Jason and his clone (which was created using a portion of Jason's brain). After Jason disposes of his clone and assimilates the portion of his brain it possessed, his memories of Pamela (who he and the clone did not recognize) are restored.|$|E

According to witnesses, two assailants stopped and dragged them from the rickshaw to the pavement before striking them with machetes. Roy was struck and stabbed in the head with sharp weapons. His wife was slashed on her shoulders and the fingers of her left hand severed when she attempted to go to her husband's aid. Both were rushed to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where Roy died at 10:30 p.m. His wife survived the attack.|$|E

40|$|Tailor-made {{biomaterials}} with tunable functionality {{are crucial}} for various applications, ranging from high performance fibers to tissue engineering. Our {{goal is to}} <b>bio-engineer</b> a novel family of spider silk biopolymers by taking control of chemistry, composition, and size to mimic properties of native spider silk. Since spiders are hard to farm like silkworms in high densities due to their carnivorous nature, we cannot produce large amounts of spider silk from farm-raised spiders. Genetic engineering is an alternative approach to produce large quantities of spider silk for commercial applications. The relevant genes of spiders have been cloned and inserted into several different organisms, such as E. coli, goat and silkworm, to make spider silks. However, producing large-scale truly spider-like silk is still a big challenge due to the small protein size, low yield and low water solubility of bio-synthetic spider silk. The current study reports our recent progress in bio-synthetic production of spider silk protein in E. coli. We have constructed a plasmid vector with spider silk protein genes. With media optimization and protein induction studies, we have developed a fermentation process, which can express spider silk proteins in E. coli in the level at or above 0. 5 g/L...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} effect of the tube-building, habitat {{structuring}} polychaete Lanice conchilega on the macrobenthic community and sediment characteristics of its habitat. To investigate which factors make species occur in a well-known bio-engineered habitat, macrofaunal and sedimentological data, gathered over a period of 10 years in a shallow, fine sediment bottom of the Belgian Part of the North Sea, were submitted to analyses. Both sediment composition and community structure of the associated macrofaunal matrix were affected by the presence of L. conchilega. The effect of the protruding tubes on hydrodynamics clearly resulted in the retention of fine sediment particles, while the increased coarse fraction was assumed to reflect a dynamic population build-up. This study confirmed that tube aggregations of L. conchilega expand the realized niche of several species without forming their own association. A species rank list was created according to each species' association with L. conchilega. This species rank list is extensively discussed based on all ecological knowledge available. Species are favoured by the habitat modifying ability of the polychaete tubes, which create and regulate refuge for species, alter the interactions between local species and change the physical factors of the environment. This descriptive and correlative data study examines the ecological importance of the <b>bio-engineer</b> L. conchilega on species level. ...|$|E
40|$|Because {{of recent}} {{advances}} in medical technology, patients who have undergone severe trauma or illness are surviving where {{they would not have}} in the past. In many instances it is necessary for patients' stay in hospital to be protracted for a number of months until they are sufficiently medically fit for discharge. Many times, before such a patient can return as a productive member of society a programme of intensive rehabilitation is necessary. Amongst the most difficult tasks confronting those responsible for rehabilitating such long stay non-acute patients, is that of rehabilitating a quadriplegic. Quadriplegia, or as it is sometimes referred to, - tetraplegia - is defined as the partial or total loss of motor function in both upper and lower limbs. This thesis deals with {{some of the problems that}} are presented by patients who suffer quadriplegia, and with practical engineering solutions to some of these problems. Functional rehabilitation, by augmenting and supplementing the patient's residual ability so that he may most effectively interface with his surroundings, is the chief theme of this work. Particular emphasis is laid on the contribution of the <b>bio-engineer</b> to the efforts of the team of specialists assigned to rehabilitate the quadriplegic. The purpose of this project is two-fold, being directed tov 1 ard returning as great a degree of independence to the patient as possible, and relieving to some extent the burden placed on the family and those having to tend to the patient's needs...|$|E
