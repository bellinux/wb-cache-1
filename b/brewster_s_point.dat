40|$|AbstractBy {{extending}} the ideal generation conjecture, we formulate the minimal resolution conjecture for a sufficiently generic {{set of points}} in Pn and we explicitly write out the conjectured values of the Betti numbers.

We also prove the Cohen-Macaulay type conjecture for <b>s</b> <b>points,</b> with n + 1 ≤ s ≤ (2 + nn) !

For a projective plane of order q, we prove that s ≤ 1 + (q + 1) (√ q − 1) and we also show that equality can be attained in this bound whenever q is an even power of two. ...|$|R
