25|$|The play {{opens with}} Linzi telling Marsha {{what she wants}} for her small son's {{birthday}} party, but she also drops hints that all is not well {{between her and her}} husband Charlie. Linzi is frustrated that he will miss his son's birthday party while giving a celebrity interview. But at a deeper level she wants her own fame back as a TV presenter; she stopped when she had children, but got stuck afterwards as a celebrity wife. When Charlie arrives they quarrel, escalating to abuse, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> the journalist, Gale, appears they embrace as a happy celebrity couple.|$|E
500|$|ActionAid, {{a charity}} which co-ordinates a schools {{programme}} with 10:10, approved {{the decision to}} withdraw the film, and stated [...] "Our job is to encourage proactive decisions at class level to reduce carbon emissions. We did it because evidence shows children are deeply concerned about climate change and because we see the impacts {{of it in the}} developing world where a lot of our work is. So we think the 10:10 campaign is very important, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> this film was seen it was clear it was inappropriate." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} offered Dr. No to Guy Green, Guy Hamilton, Val Guest and Ken Hughes to direct, {{but all of}} them {{turned it}} down. They finally signed Terence Young who had a long background with Broccoli's Warwick Films as the director. Broccoli and Saltzman felt that Young would {{be able to make a}} real impression of James Bond and transfer the essence of the character from book to film. Young imposed many stylistic choices for the character which continued throughout the film series. Young also decided to inject much humour, as he considered that [...] "a lot of things in this film, the sex and violence and so on, if played straight, a) would be objectionable, and b) we're never gonna go past the censors; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> you take the mickey out, put the tongue out in the cheek, it seems to disarm." ...|$|E

500|$|Sawa {{described}} {{his role as}} [...] "in the beginning, [...] was kinda loopy and cotter, and you know, probably not the most popular guy in school. I think {{he might have been}} a dork, you know, doing their stuff and they had their own thing going and they're after the two beautiful girls in school, but there's no chance of that happening. I guess after the plane goes down, his world completely changes". [...] "Devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible," [...] Wong said. [...] "He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. [...] He's more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero". Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as [...] "a very distinctive actor. He's very loose and he's kind of a cut-up when he's not on camera, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> the camera's on, I'd never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment".|$|E
500|$|Terry-Thomas {{identified}} himself as a comedy actor, but regarded himself [...] "first and foremost, as a comedian with a built-in ability to inject humour into situations". He worked hard at the humour element, especially during his days in cabaret and revue; he wrote that he [...] "spent {{an enormous amount of}} time studying how to write humour and reading books on the philosophical approach to it, but it didn't get me very far. I decided that humour was like a good watch. It would go well if left to do its job <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> one started poking around, it went wonky". While working on his television series How do you View?, he would change lines around to ensure the scene worked well, even if he gave the best lines to others; it was a quality which was appreciated by a number of others, including Jack Lemmon, who appeared with Terry-Thomas in How to Murder Your Wife. Lemmon commented that [...] "like most really good professionals he was generous to fellow actors. He worked with you, not at you".|$|E

When visiting Mrs. Liu at the hospital, the EM3 teacher announces that one of Kok Pin's drawings won second prize in an international competition, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> is overshadowed by the rush to save Mrs. Liu's life. Mr. Khoo passes the transplant test, but refuses to donate after discovering the intended recipient is his enemy's wife. He eventually relents, but it is revealed that due to a mix-up Terry, not Mr. Khoo, is the suitable donor. Despite protests from his parents, he insists on undergoing the operation, which is a success. A grateful Mr. Liu offers to help Mr. Khoo's business with his proposal. As a result, Mr. Khoo's business booms, and the two enemies become good friends. [...] The film ends with Terry being bullied again, as in the beginning of the movie [...] but this time, he stands up for himself and fights back.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles {{played at}} the opening of the Casbah Coffee Club on 29 August 1959, which was in the cellar of Mona Best's house. Aspinall later rented a room in the house and became very good friends with then-Beatle Pete Best. The Beatles had {{previously}} used public transport to get to local gigs, but by February 1961, they were playing two or three concerts per night at different locations and needed someone to drive them. Best asked Aspinall to be a part-time road manager for the band, so Aspinall bought an [...] "old, grey and maroon Commer van" [...] for £80, and charged each of the group five shillings (25p) per concert. Harrison later said: [...] "Our early van became the centre of attention every time it pulled up. It was brush-painted red and grey and from head to foot was covered in graffiti – girls' names, and things like 'I love you, John'. It looked interesting, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> anybody saw it they would feel free to write all over it.” The Beatles returned from their second trip to Hamburg in July 1961, and Aspinall left his job to become their permanent road manager, as he was earning more money driving them around than he was earning by being an accountant.|$|E
500|$|The song is also {{included}} in the set list of her the 2012 Born This Way Ball Tour. To Kwaak Je-yup of The Korea Times was positive about the performance of the song during the tour saying that, [...] "The highlight of the night was her first slow jam 'Hair,' which she introduced as her favorite track on the 'Born This Way' album... Playing the guitar-shaped keyboard, she flubbed her line once and admitted it right away — 'I'm getting too excited (that) I forgot my lines,' she said — <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> made the experience personal." [...] On the second night of Gaga's show in the Philippines, she addressed the controversy directly before a slow-tempo version of [...] "Hair". While playing the piano she stated that she is aware of the issues around her image and music, she emphasized that she respects all kinds of religion, people and culture – including Filipino culture. She also said that she respects that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but stressed [...] "What I don’t respect is homophobia and hatred…I reject intolerance to the gay community." [...] This drew cheers from the audience. She {{went on to say that}} she is aware some are using her name to spread hatred but intended to counter this by continuing to spread [...] "positivity" [...] in her own way.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, The Wires Esther Zuckerman {{criticized the}} {{inclusion}} of a romantic relationship in the film, and said of the two characters' kiss: [...] "There's a case to be made that the kiss is simply an acceptance of their fate, but everything we know about Rita up until this point implies that she's a dedicated soldier, and making her a sudden romantic betrays her character." [...] Zuckerman added: [...] "That's not to say she can't soften up a bit as humans do, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> reads less like she's accepting her humanity and more like the filmmakers had to acknowledge two attractive leads ... who should lock lips because that's what men and women do in movies." [...] Writing in The Week, Monika Bartyzel also criticized the romance in the film, stating that Rita is the one who kisses Cage, despite knowing him for only a day where he had known her for multiple days via time loop. Bartyzel said that Rita's portrayal was part of a commonly seen motif in which a female character helps a male [...] "Chosen One" [...] character, and that this was [...] "the new normal because it allows Hollywood to appeal to feminist concerns while continuing to feed male wish fulfillment". Bartyzel said that Rita [...] "at her most powerful" [...] ultimately serves [...] "to make the male hero into a fighter like herself".|$|E

500|$|Scogin's introspective lyrics {{have covered}} topics like materialism, death, and the Nashville Christian music industry. The lyrics for Wars and Rumors of Wars were formed after a family loss: [...] "...only {{a year ago}} my father passed away. And I hate to say this, because it sounds like such a band-dude thing to say, but the lyrics are a lot darker than any other record just because of how {{personal}} they are for me." [...] Scogin usually refers to his lyrics as poems and has maintained that [...] "a song is never finished but abandoned." [...] "...as an artist you can forever be changing a song or making a song 'better' or whatever <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> that you stop recording and send it off to be mastered you have not 'finished' the song…you have only abandoned the song {{and that is how}} it will stay forever." [...] His lyrics sometimes espouse Christian themes and beliefs, albeit subtly. For example, the track [...] "Yellow Dress: Locked Knees" [...] from Everything... contains the Spanish lyrics [...] "Jesus, yo quiero que este mundo te conozca."; when translated, it says [...] "Jesus, I want this world to know You." [...] The song [...] "And Shot Each Other" [...] from The Fiancée fades out into a Sacred Harp choir singing the song 'Child of Grace', which features the lyrics [...] "How happy is a child of grace, who feels his sins forgiven / This world, he cries, is not my place / I seek a place in Heaven." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1888, {{newly married}} and having moved to Manhattan [...] from her parents' home, Cotton sought {{to become a}} student of William Merritt Chase. He agreed to teach her {{and at the same}} time asked whether she would sit for a portrait. In 1908 Chase {{described}} the meeting: [...] "One morning a young lady came into my Tenth street studio, just as I was leaving for an art class in Brooklyn. She came as a pupil, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> she appeared before me I saw her only as a splendid model. Half way to the elevated station I stopped, hastened back, and overtook her. She consented to sit for me; and I painted that day, without an interruption, till late in the evening. The result is the Lady in Black, now hung in the Metropolitan Museum." [...] In 1889 a second Chase portrait of her, [...] "Lady in Pink," [...] was shown at the Spring Exhibition at the National Academy of Design in New York.|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Irwin Ross {{summed up}} the contradictions in Dewey's {{personality}} by noting that [...] "more than most politicians, he displayed an enormous gap between his private and his public manner. To friends and colleagues he was warm and gracious, considerate of others' views… He could tell a joke and was not dismayed by an off-color story. In public, however, he tended to freeze up, either out of diffidence or too stern {{a sense of the}} dignity of office. The smiles would seem forced… the glad-handing gesture awkward." [...] In a similar vein, a magazine writer in the 1940s described the difference between Dewey's private and public behavior by noting that [...] "Till he gets to the door, he may be cracking jokes and laughing like a schoolboy. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> he enters a room he ceases to be Tom Dewey and becomes what he thinks the Governor of New York ought to be." ...|$|E

This being so, according to the then rules, {{he ought to have}} retired back as far as he pleased, without parting with the ball, for the combatants on the opposite side could only advance to the spot where he had caught the ball, and were unable to rush forward till he had either punted it or had placed it for some one else to kick, for it was by means of these placed kicks that most of the goals were in those days kicked, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> the ball touched the ground the opposite side might rush on. Ellis, for the first time, disregarded this rule, and on catching the ball, instead of retiring backwards, rushed forwards with the ball in his hands towards the opposite goal, with what result as to the game I know not, neither do I know how this infringement of a well-known rule was followed up, or when it became, as it is now, a standing rule." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 29 May 1942 it was {{announced}} that all Jews living in the occupied zone had to wear a yellow star of David with the words Juif or Juive written on it at all times by 7 June 1942. Ousby described the purpose of the yellow star [...] "not just to identify but [...] to humiliate, and it worked".On 14 June 1942, a 12-year-old Jewish boy committed suicide in Paris as his classmates were now shunning the boy with the yellow star. As a form of quiet protest, many Jewish veterans started to wear their medals alongside the yellow star, which led the Germans to ban all Jewish veterans from wearing their medals alongside the yellow stars of David due to being [...] "inappropriate", as it increased popular sympathy for men who fought and suffered for France. At times, ordinary people would show sympathy for Jews; as a Scot married to a Frenchman, Janet Teissier du Cros wrote in her diary about a Jewish woman wearing her yellow star of David going shopping: [...] "She came humbly up and stood hesitating {{on the edge of the}} pavement. Jews were not allowed to stand in queues. What they were supposed to do I never discovered. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> the people in the queue saw her they signed to her to join us. Secretly and rapidly, as in the game of hunt-the-slipper, she was passed up till she stood at the head of the queue. I am glad to say that not one voice was raised in protest, the policeman standing near turned his head away, and that she got her cabbage before any of us".By 1942, the Paris Kommandantur was receiving an average of 1,500 corbeaux (poison pen letters) a day. One corbeaux written by a Frenchwoman read:"Since you are taking care of the Jews, and if your campaign is not just a vain word, then have a look at the kind of life led by the girl M.A, formerly a dancer, now living at 41 Boulevard de Strasbourg, not wearing a star. This creature, for whom being Jewish is not enough, debauches the husbands of proper Frenchwomen, and you may well have an idea what she is living off. Defend women against Jewishness-that will be your best publicity, and you will return a French husband to his wife". In the summer of 1942, a committee consisting of SS Hauptsturmführer Theodor Dannecker, the Commissioner for Jewish Affairs Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, and general secretary of the police René Bousquet had been planning a grand rafle (great round-up) of Jews to deport to the death camps. On the morning of 16 July 1942, the grand rafle was launched with 9,000 French policemen rounding up the Jews of Paris, leading to some 12,762 Jewish men, women and children being arrested and brought to the Val d'Hiv sports stadium, from where they were sent to the Drancy camp and finally Auschwitz. The grand rafle was a joint operation; the overwhelming majority of those who arrested the Jews were French policemen. During the grand rafle, some 100 Jews warned by friends in the police killed themselves, while 24 Jews were killed resisting arrest. One Jewish Frenchwoman, Madame Rado, who was arrested during the grand rafle with her four children, noted about the watching bystanders: [...] "Their expressions were empty, apparently indifferent". When taken with the other Jews to the Place Voltaire, one woman was heard to shout [...] "Well done! Well done!" [...] while the man standing to her warned her [...] "After them, it'll be us. Poor people!". Rado herself survived Auschwitz, but her four children were killed in the gas chambers.|$|E
