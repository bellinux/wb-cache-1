5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E

25|$|If {{electrons}} {{emitted from}} the cathode flew freely until {{they arrived at}} the grid, they would acquire a kinetic energy that's proportional to the voltage applied to the grid. 1 eV of kinetic energy corresponds to a potential difference of 1 volt between the grid and the cathode. Elastic collisions with the mercury atoms increase the time it takes for an electron to arrive at the grid, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> kinetic energy of electrons arriving there isn't much affected.

25|$|Once a {{tribunal}} convened, {{the burden}} of proof was normally substantiated by escape reports from the internment camp commanders, arrest reports from police, and interrogations carried out by an official investigator, who was appointed to the court for a three-year term. This preliminary investigation was a laborious process, added to by the circumstances of the internees' travels during their escapes, and did not facilitate the swift execution of justice. The Swiss military justice system was quickly overwhelmed by the rash of escape attempts in the summer of 1944. For the minority of indicted internees who eventually received verdicts, the average sentence was 74 days in prison, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> time to complete the investigations and military tribunals was 82 days.|$|E
25|$|Many freedpeople {{could not}} afford to {{purchase}} land immediately after the war, but earned money in jobs outside farming such as fishing and oystering. Black land ownership thus increased even faster (though not for everyone) during the 1870s. In Charles City County, three-quarters of Black farm workers owned their own farms, with an average size of 36 acres. In York County, 50% owned their farms, which averaged 20 acres. (Statedwide, the number of landowners was high, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> size of land was only 4 acres.) These relatively small farms, on relatively poor land, did not generate enormous profits. However, they did constitute a base of economic power, and Blacks from this region held political office at a high rate.|$|E
25|$|It is {{challenging}} {{to determine the}} length of the egg phase because eggs are sometimes eaten as part of a dominance struggle. However, since the first eggs, which produce the first workers, are much less likely to get eaten, one can obtain a general sense of the timing. Most of these first eggs hatch within 10–13 days of being laid. Once the eggs hatch, the larval stage begins. The duration of this phase varies significantly, mostly based {{on the development of the}} colony. As the development of the colony varies, so do the feeding practices, and rate of feeding effects the duration of the larval stage. The length of the larval stages peaks at 60 days, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> larvae remained in the larval phase for 15–30 days.|$|E

There was a third century in 1930 – 108 against Middlesex at Taunton – and he missed the 1000 runs in the season by only 15. In 1931, there were 1034 runs, and in the first three matches of the season, Case increased his highest first-class score twice. First, in the match against Hampshire at Taunton, he hit 131 with 12 fours.

25|$|The {{number of}} {{sessions}} {{depends on the}} situation, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> is 5-20 sessions.

This has the advantage of making differences between the ways family members perceive mutual relations as well as interaction patterns in the session apparent both for the therapist and the family. These patterns frequently mirror habitual interaction patterns at home, even though the therapist is now incorporated into the family system. Therapy interventions usually focus on relationship patterns rather than on analyzing impulses of the unconscious mind or early childhood trauma of individuals as a Freudian therapist would do - although some schools of family therapy, for example psychodynamic and intergenerational, do consider such individual and historical factors (thus embracing both linear and circular causation) and they may use instruments such as the genogram to help to elucidate the patterns of relationship across generations.|$|E
25|$|When the oryx is not {{wandering}} its habitat or eating, it digs shallow depressions in {{soft ground}} under shrubs or trees for resting.

The number of individuals in herd can vary greatly (up to 100 have been reported occasionally), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> is 10 or fewer individuals.

If separated, males will search areas where the herd last visited, settling into a solitary existence until the herd's return. Where water and grazing conditions permit, male oryx establish territories. Bachelor males are solitary.

Males and females use their horns to defend the sparse territorial resources against interlopers.|$|E
