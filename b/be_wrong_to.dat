They were not convinced that he was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but feeling it would <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> prevent him from trying, they had allowed him to go to the RCM. Nevertheless, a university education was expected of him, and in 1892 he temporarily left the RCM and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years, studying music and history.|$|E

25|$|The {{essential}} {{requirements of a}} National Park are {{that it should have}} great natural beauty, a high value for open-air recreation and substantial continuous extent.

Lastly there is merit in variety and with the wide diversity of landscape which is available in England and Wales, it would <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> confine the selection of National Parks to the more rugged areas of mountain and moorland, and to exclude other districts which, though of less outstanding grandeur and wildness, have their own distinctive beauty and a high recreational value.|$|E

25|$|In 617, Xiao Xi, a {{great-grandson}} of Emperor Xuan of Western Liang, whom Cen Wenben's grandfather Cen Shanfang had served, rose in rebellion, {{claiming to}} restore the Liang dynasty. Xiao Xi established his capital at Jiangling (江陵, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), and he summoned Cen Wenben to serve as Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng). Cen {{was in charge of}} writing the imperial edicts. In 621, when the Tang dynasty general Li Xiaogong (a nephew of Emperor Gaozu, the founding emperor of the Tang dynasty) attacked Liang and put Jiangling under siege, Cen suggested to Xiao Xi that he surrendered, and Xiao Xi did so. After Xiao Xi's surrender, however, Li Xiaogong's subordinates wanted to pillage the city. Cen persuaded Li Xiaogong that it would <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> do so, and Li Xiaogong subsequently ordered against pillaging. As Li Xiaogong was then put in charge of the former Liang capital, he invited Cen to serve on his staff. In 623, when Emperor Gaozu sent Li Xiaogong to attack the rebel leader Fu Gongshi, Cen followed Li Xiaogong and was in charge of his military correspondences. After Li Xiaogong defeated and killed Fu Gongshi and was put in charge of Fu's capital Danyang (丹楊, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), Cen continued to serve on Li Xiaogong's staff.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the next}} seven years he {{continued}} his research and lecture tours assisted and encouraged by his wife and children. All this came to an end on July 16, 1917, however, when Lomax was fired along with six other faculty members {{as the result of a}} political battle between Governor James E. Ferguson and the University President, Dr. R. E. Vinson. Lomax moved to Chicago to take a job selling bonds at Lee, Higginson & Co; a bond brokerage firm run by the son of his old professor Barrett Wendell. A few months later, Ferguson was impeached and the Board of Regents rescinded its dismissal of the faculty. Lomax judged that it would <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> leave his post at Lee, Higginson & Co so soon after arriving, especially with regards to his friendship with the family of Barrett Wendell, so he remained in Chicago for eighteen months until the war ended. There he struck up a what turned out to be a lifelong friendship with Chicago poet Carl Sandburg, who frequently mentions him in his book, American Songbag (1927). In 1919, his next book, Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow Camp, an anthology of cowboy poetry, was published by Macmillan. That year Lomax returned to Texas to be secretary of the Texas Exes, which had become financially independent of the University, so as to avoid further interference from politicians. Nevertheless, interference struck, when Ferguson, whom the law prohibited from holding office, ran his wife, Miriam A. Ferguson, as his surrogate. As governor, Mrs. Ferguson was able to pack the board of regents and oust John from his job as editor of The Alcade, which during his tenure was a 100-page long publication. Seeing how the wind was blowing, Lomax resigned his secretaryship and joined the Republic Bank of Dallas in 1925. The economic crash of 1929 presaged bad things for the bank, however.|$|E

[...] In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: [...] "You sentence {{off the top of}} your head. If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's {{something to be said for}} him, you do your best not to put him inside." [...] Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.|$|E

500|$|The {{ideas of}} the Black Consciousness Movement were not {{developed}} solely by Biko, but through lengthy discussions with other black students who were rejecting white liberalism. Biko was influenced by his reading of authors like Frantz Fanon, Malcolm X, Léopold Sédar Senghor, James Cone, and Paulo Freire. The Martinique-born Fanon, in particular, has been cited as a profound influence over Biko's ideas about liberation. Biko's biographer Xolela Mangcu cautioned that it would <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> reduce Biko's thought to an interpretation of Fanon, and {{that the impact of}} [...] "the political and intellectual history of the Eastern Cape" [...] had to be appreciated too. Additional influences on Black Consciousness were the United States-based Black Power movement, and forms of Christianity like the activist-oriented black theology.|$|E

Mason said Wright's contributions to Floyd were under-rated, and that his playing [...] "was the sound that knitted it all together", comparing his [...] "quiet one" [...] status in the band to George Harrison. Gilmour called him [...] "my musical partner and my friend", praised {{the ability of the}} two men's voices to blend, such as on [...] "Echoes". Wright's death brought Pink Floyd to a formal end, with Gilmour re-iterating that it would <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> resume touring without him.|$|E

Mugabe had a considerable following within Zimbabwe, with David Blair noting that [...] "it would <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> imply that he lacked genuine popularity" [...] in the country. Holland believed that the [...] "great majority" [...] of Zimbabwe's population supported him [...] "enthusiastically" [...] during the first twenty years of his regime.

500|$|Many historians {{credit the}} Reform Act 1832 with {{launching}} modern democracy in Britain. G. M.

Sir Erskine May notes that the [...] "reformed Parliament was, unquestionably, more liberal and progressive in its policy than the Parliaments of old; more vigorous and active; more susceptible to the influence of public opinion; and more secure in the confidence of the people", but admitted that [...] "grave defects still remained to be considered". Other historians have argued that genuine democracy began to arise only with the Second Reform Act in 1867, or perhaps even later. Norman Gash states that [...] "it would <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> assume that the political scene in the succeeding generation differed essentially from that of the preceding one".|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Demonstration was {{met with}} {{generally}} favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 69, based on ten reviews. David Jeffries of AllMusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, commenting that [...] "guest shots from Paloma Faith, Emeli Sandé, Dizzee Rascal, and others make this one crowded album, but figuring out what to drop is nearly impossible as everyone hits the mark." [...] Gigwise Nick Scott gave the album eight out of ten stars, saying that [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> compare Disc-Overy to Demonstration; this is the Tinie Tempah of now.

Quinton however rejected the plea and clarified the league's stance: BSkyB's bid was better [...] "...not only in money terms {{but as far as}} the potential for future income is concerned." [...] The ITV companies sought legal action, claiming a breach of obligation on behalf of Quinton and Parry. East revealed that it was only after BSkyB had won did they discover the company had submitted an improved bid: [...] "At no stage were we informed that Sky had put in another bid and nor were we given any opportunity to increase our bid in response." [...] Parry said ITV would have won broadcasting rights had they [...] "allowed us to have a pay channel in the long term and it had terrestrial coverage in the short-term." [...] The High Court refused to grant an injunction; the judge concluded the matter was [...] "a great deal more difficult than it seems at first sight" [...] and it would <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> force the league to consider new offers. The court however found an arguable case for a breach of confidence. Soon afterwards, ITV issued a writ seeking damages against the FA and Premier League. They also submitted a separate complaint to the Office of Fair Trading to look into Murdoch's newspapers.|$|E
500|$|An Honorary Life Member of the MCC, Gilligan {{served as}} MCC {{president}} from 1967 to 1968. During his tenure, the MCC {{was involved in}} controversy over the non-selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira in the England team {{on the grounds of}} his colour. Gilligan, in his capacity as MCC president, was aware of this having seen a private letter which communicated the explicit threat from the South African prime minister B. J. Vorster that the forthcoming tour would be cancelled if D'Oliveira were selected. However, he and the others who saw the letter, G. O. B. Allen and Billy Griffith, respectively the MCC treasurer and secretary, kept this information to themselves. When the English selectors met to choose the team, Gilligan, Allen and Griffith were present to represent the MCC. A BBC programme in 2004 claimed that Gilligan pressured the selectors to leave out D'Oliveira, but D'Oliveira's biographer Peter Oborne suggests that Allen carried far more influence at the meeting. He writes of Gilligan's part in the affair: [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> make too much of Gilligan's embarrassing past. Given that presidents are appointed for only a year, it was a very strong president indeed who could impose his personality on the permanent MCC secretariat of Griffith and Allen, and Gilligan was not a strong president." [...] Initially D'Oliveira was left out of the team, but when a player withdrew with an injury, the selectors added him as a replacement; the South African government barred D'Oliveira from taking part and the MCC cancelled the tour.|$|E
