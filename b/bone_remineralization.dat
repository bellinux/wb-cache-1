40|$|Osteomalacia is not {{rare in the}} UK and climatically similar countries, {{particularly}} in elderly people and those of Asian descent. Overt clinical osteomalacia is usually treated with a loading dose of vitamin D, followed by a regular supplement. However, little is known of the time taken to reach a stable biochemical state after starting treatment. Such information would {{shed light on the}} duration of the <b>bone</b> <b>remineralization</b> phase and guide decisions on the length of follow-up. To address this we conducted a 2 -year follow-up study of 42 patients (35 female, mean age 80. 8 years) with biopsy proven osteomalacia treated with a standard replacement regimen and general nutritional support...|$|E
40|$|Hungry bone {{syndrome}} is a unusual complication of the postoperative period of primary hyperparathyroidism. This {{syndrome is}} characterized by hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, due to an excessive <b>bone</b> <b>remineralization.</b> We report the clinical features, laboratory and therapy in four females (aged 39 to 73 years old) with a long standing hyperparathyroidism, elevated alkaline phosphatases and decreased bone mineralization in two. The mean size of the adenoma was 2. 9 ± 1. 1 cm. Hypocalcemia appeared between days 1 and 6 of the postoperative period. All were treated with calcium, calcitriol and magnesium at different timing and dosages. The mean hospitalization period was 19. 8 ± 2. 1 days. As reported previously, low bone mineralization and a large adenoma are risk factors for the syndrome. Serial monitoring of serum calcium and magnesium and an early supplementation of these minerals could prevent hypocalcemia and decrease the hospitalization time.

40|$|Increased {{levels of}} intact {{parathyroid}} hormone (PTH) {{have been documented}} after surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) despite normocalcemia. The pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. Seventeen consecutive patients operated on for solitary parathyroid adenoma were investigated before and at 8 weeks and 1 year after surgery with serum levels of intact PTH, biochemical variables known to reflect PTH activity, and bone mineral content (BMC). In addition, an oral calcium loading test was performed 8 weeks after the operation. All patients had low or normal serum calcium levels during follow-up. Eight weeks after operation six patients (35 %) had an increased serum PTH level. These patients (group I) preoperatively had higher serum levels of PTH and alkaline phosphatase than patients with normal PTH levels (group II). They also had lower BMC and larger parathyroid adenomas. They {{did not differ in}} renal function. At 8 weeks after operation group I showed higher mean serum levels of osteocalcin and propeptide of type I procollagen but lower urinary calcium excretion. In contrast to patients in group II, they also showed a lower calciuric response and a trend to a lower calcemic response during the oral calcium load. The two groups showed similar parathyroid sensitivity for calcium. Patients in group I demonstrated a significant increase in BMC the first year after the operation. Increased serum PTH 8 weeks after surgery for sporadic parathyroid adenoma was not due to persistent pHPT or impaired renal function. Instead, the results imply there is diminished calcium absorption and increased bone turnover with cortical <b>bone</b> <b>remineralization...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} {{production}} status on the serum levels of calcium and phosphorus of laying hens was examined. Commercial-type White Leghorn hens, 66 weeks of age, were selected {{on the basis}} of whether or not they had laid an egg each day during a two-day period. A five ml. blood sample was collected via anterior heart puncture from each of the selected hens and subject-ed to serum calcium and phosphorus analyses. Serum phosphorus varied significantly in relation to whether or not a bird laid an egg the day before and/or the day of blood collection. Except for birds which were reproductively inactive, serum calcium was less affected by production status than was serum phosphorus. It was hypothesized that the variations were related to the physiological changes in shell calcification activity, <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>remineralization,</b> intestinal absorption of minerals and muscular activity. It was suggested from the results that birds selected for serum mineral analyses should be of similar production status...|$|R
40|$|Background: Using {{implants}} for {{dental applications}} are well-accepted procedures {{as one of}} the solutions for periodontal defect repair. Suitable design and materials, their reaction with the surrounding hard tissues and interfacial biomechanical properties are still considered to be the primary criteria which need to be addressed systematically. In the present study, a thorough and systemic approach was made to identify a suitable implant, considering the above criteria after both in vitro and in vivo animal trials. Materials and Methods: Titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) implants, with thread and without thread models, were implanted to the mid-metaphysial portion of the tibia of the right hind leg of three white Australian Chinchilla rabbit species and their effects and response to the surrounding bone were investigated. Parameters studied included hematological and biochemical features (serum alkaline phosphatase and calcium), both preoperatively and postoperatively, consecutively for 7 days and after 1 - 3 months. The interfacial integrity and compositional variation along the interface were studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX) and histopathology from 1 to 3 months consecutively. Finally, biomechanical properties were studied with the help of push-out test. Results: <b>Bone</b> <b>remineralization</b> started through the process of electro-physiological ionic exchanges, which helps in formation of osteoblastic cells in the area of bony injury. The SEM-EDAX results confirmed the initial stability for the Ti (with thread) implant, but the regeneration of new bone formation was faster in the case of Ti (Without thread) implant, and hence could be used for faster healing. These have also been substantiated through push-out and histopathlogical tests. Conclusion: From the physico-chemical and biomechanical observations, it was found that that smooth type implants were well accepted in the physiological condition although chances of elemental leaching from the surface were also observed. Increase of the surface roughness can help into the formation of physico-chemical bondage with the surrounding hard tissues...|$|E
