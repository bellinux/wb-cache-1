5|$|Both {{teams were}} evenly matched, with the West Indies not the force they had been, and England on the rise. The key players for the West Indies were Lara, Walsh and Bishop while England {{had a strong}} opening pair of Atherton and Graham Thorpe plus the young Dominic Cork who would <b>be</b> <b>decisive</b> in England's two Test {{victories}} in this series.|$|E
5|$|The three ironclad ships {{selected}} differed {{substantially in}} design and degree of risk. Monitor was the most innovative design {{by virtue of its}} low freeboard, shallow-draft iron hull, and total dependence on steam power. The riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret, something that had not previously been tested by any navy. Ericsson's guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to <b>be</b> <b>decisive</b> in choosing his design despite the risk involved.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-finals, Slavia Prague were Stuttgart's next opponents. The away leg at Stadion Evžena Rošického {{ended in}} a 1–1 draw {{following}} a Poschner goal. Back on German soil, Stuttgart won 2–0 after Krasimir Balakov scored two goals, giving them a 3–1 overall win. In the semi-finals, Stuttgart were drawn against Lokomotiv Moscow. The first home leg ended 2–1 to the German side, with Bobic finding the winning goal late; the first was netted by Akpoborie. At Lokomotiv Stadium, Bobic once again managed to score, during the first half, which proved to <b>be</b> <b>decisive</b> as Stuttgart won 1–0 and the concluding tie 3–1 to proceed to the final.|$|E

5|$|Subject matter. First, the {{justiciability}} of {{an issue}} depends on the subject matter at hand and not the source of decision-making power.

It was acknowledged in Singapore Airlines {{that there may be}} matters of fact not in the public domain which may be known only to the executive.

5|$|The {{fighting}} in Normandy continued until August 1944, when the Allies {{broke out of}} the region and rapidly advanced to the German border. This campaign dominated the activities of eight of the ten Australian squadrons in the UK, as well as most of the airmen posted to RAF units. During July and August the RAAF units operated at or near their highest level of activity in the war to that point, but morale remained high as the airmen perceived that the contribution of air power to the campaign would <b>be</b> <b>decisive.</b> Large numbers of Australian airmen who were undergoing training or awaiting a posting on D-Day were assigned to combat units during the fighting to replace casualties of the Normandy campaign.|$|E

5|$|World War I was {{the most}} devastating in British {{military}} history, with nearly 800,000 men killed and over twomillion wounded. Early in the war, the BEF was virtually destroyed and was replaced first by volunteers and then a conscript force. Major battles included those at the Somme and Passchendaele. Advances in technology saw {{the advent of the}} tank (and the creation of the Royal Tank Regiment) and advances in aircraft design (including the creation of the Royal Flying Corps) which would <b>be</b> <b>decisive</b> in future battles. Trench warfare dominated Western Front strategy for most of the war, and the use of chemical weapons (disabling and poison gases) added to the devastation.|$|E

He made his First Division debut as a {{substitute}} on 18 October, a 1–1 draw with Sunderland at Roker Park. He scored his first goal for the Gunners in the reverse fixture against Sunderland at Highbury, which ended in a 3–1 win. He went on to appear as a 77th-minute substitute in {{the first leg of}} the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final against Belgian club Anderlecht at Constant Vanden Stock Stadium, and scored a late goal in a 3–1 defeat. Though he did not appear in the second leg, his goal proved to <b>be</b> <b>decisive</b> as Arsenal claimed a 4–3 aggregate victory to win the first European trophy in the club's history.|$|E

Liverpool won the European Super Cup with a comprehensive 7–1 victory over German club Hamburg. Liverpool also reached the 1977 FA Cup Final, but lost the chance to follow Arsenal's feat at achieving the Double as they were beaten 2–1 by bitter rivals Manchester United. In the European Cup, Liverpool beat Crusaders (Northern Ireland), Trabzonspor (Turkey), AS Saint-Étienne (France), and FC Zürich (Switzerland) to reach the final against German side Borussia Mönchengladbach. In the final at Rome's Stadio Olimpico, Kennedy won a late penalty which Phil Neal converted to give Liverpool a 3–1 victory.|$|E

5|$|The fall of Great Moravia made {{room for}} the {{expansion}} of the Czech or Bohemian state, which likewise incorporated some of the Polish lands. The founder of the Přemyslid dynasty, Prince Bořivoj, was baptized by Methodius in the Slavic rite during the later part of the 9th century and settled in Prague. His son and successor Spytihněv was baptized in Regensburg in the Latin rite, which marks the early stage of East Frankish/German influence in Bohemian affairs, which was destined to <b>be</b> <b>decisive.</b> Borivoj's grandson Prince Wenceslaus, the future Czech martyr and patron saint, was killed, probably in 935, by his brother Boleslaus. Boleslaus I solidified the power of the Prague princes and most likely dominated the Vistulan and Lendian tribes of Lesser Poland and at least parts of Silesia.|$|E
5|$|After {{the poll}} closes, the {{presiding}} officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may affix their own seals to the ballot boxes. The ballot boxes are then taken to counting centres {{to be opened}} and the ballots counted. A candidate or his or her counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if {{the difference between the}} number of votes for the candidate with the most votes and any other candidate's number of votes is 2% or less, excluding rejected and tendered votes. After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the returning officer ascertains whether the total number of electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the number of votes for the two candidates with the highest number of votes. If so, the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest number of votes to be elected as President. If not, the overseas votes may <b>be</b> <b>decisive.</b> The returning officer then states the number of votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted.|$|E
5|$|In essence {{this type}} of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on {{psychological}} shock for effect. Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not {{get close enough to}} the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to <b>be</b> <b>decisive.</b> Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. Captain Mercer, who commanded 'G' Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, thought the Brunswick troops {{on either side of him}} so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{beginning}} of time, there has never <b>been</b> a <b>decisive</b> moment—or an indecisive moment, for that matter, as I told the film producer Dore Schary.

As a photographer, you created the image. You decide when to release the shutter.

The performance of the Iberian crews had been poor in the battle, and their dismissal would spark a rebellion in the Turdetani tribe, forcing Carthage to send 4,000 infantry and 500 cavalry to Hasdrubal.
