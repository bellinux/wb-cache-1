500|$|After Battlefield Earth was {{published}} in 1982, L. Ron Hubbard suggested that a film version of the book was in the works. He gave an interview in February 1983 to the Rocky Mountain News in which he told the reporter, [...] "I've recently written three screenplays, and some interest has been expressed in Battlefield Earth, so I suppose I'll <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>back</b> in Hollywood {{one of these days}} and probably on location in the Denver area for Battlefield Earth when they film it." ...|$|E

[...] Springer then ends the show by giving a formal lecture, sitting by himself on the stage, on the principles of refined values in regards to the featured guests. He ends the segment with the concluding statement, [...] "Till next time, take care of yourselves and each other," [...] which was his sign-off line during his days as a newscaster in Cincinnati.|$|E

2500|$|Funeral {{services}} were held for Griffin on August 17, 2007, at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. The well-attended service included Nancy Reagan; Arnold Schwarzenegger (who gave the eulogy along with Tony Griffin); Maria Shriver; and various actors, television stars, employees, and friends including Pat Sajak, Vanna White, Alex Trebek, Dick Van Dyke, Jack Klugman, Dick Van Patten, Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi, Ryan Seacrest, Catherine Oxenberg and Casper Van Dien. Pallbearers included Griffin Group vice-chairman Ron Ward, President Robert Pritchard, and Vice President Michael Eyre, {{as well as}} Tony Griffin. His 7-year-old grandson Donovan Mervyn was an honorary pallbearer as was Nancy Reagan. His 12-year-old granddaughter Farah gave a reading. A post-burial reception {{was held at the}} Beverly Hilton, a property owned by Griffin from 1987 to 2003. He was buried in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery and his headstone epitaph (even though in his book Merv, written with David Bender in 2003, states it would be [...] "Stay Tuned") reads [...] "I will not <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>back</b> after this message", an epitaph Griffin announced on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.|$|E
2500|$|Barris' jokey, bumbling personality; his accentuated hand-clapping between {{sentences}} (which eventually had {{the studio}} audience joining in with him); and his catchphrases (he would usually go into commercial break with, [...] "We'll <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>back</b> with more er... STUFF...", occasionally paired with shifting his head to reveal the ubiquitous sign behind the stage reading simply [...] "STUFF", and [...] "This is me saying 'bye'" [...] {{was one of his}} favorite closing lines) were the antithesis of the smooth TV host (such as Gary Owens, who hosted the syndicated version in its first season). Barris joined in with the eccentricity of the format, using unusual props, dressing in colorful and somewhat unusual clothing (such as the occasional hat pulled over his head, if not his eyes), he became yet another performer of the show, and for many, quite a cult hero. Dubbed [...] "Chuckie Baby" [...] by his fans, Barris was a perfect fit with the show's goofy, sometimes wild amateur performers and its panel of three judges (including regulars Jamie Farr, Jaye P. Morgan, Rex Reed and Arte Johnson). In addition, there was a growing [...] "cast of characters", including an NBC stage carpenter who played [...] "Father Ed," [...] a priest who would get flustered when his cue cards were deliberately turned upside-down; Canadian comedian Murray Langston, who as [...] "The Unknown Comic" [...] wore a paper bag over his head (with cut-outs for his eyes, mouth, and even a box of Kleenex), and [...] "Gene Gene the Dancing Machine" [...] (Gene Patton), arguably the most popular member of the [...] "cast", the show's prop man, [...] who would show up and dance whenever the band played the song [...] "Jumpin' at the Woodside". In the early 1980s, Patton was even pointed out by tour guides of incoming NBC tours as his onscreen character, {{while at the same time}} adhering to his more typical off-camera work duties.|$|E

I used to sit on the porch, in town, and I--I couldn't get over the feeling that you'd simply run up to the drug store and would <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>back,</b> and till after it got dark I'd catch myself watching, looking up the street, and you never came, and the house was so empty and still that I didn't like to go in.

6000|$|... "Well, {{of all the}} men!" [...] cried Mrs. Lander. But {{she seemed}} to find herself, upon reflection, less {{able to cope with}} Lander {{personally}} than with the situation generally. [...] "Will you send her up, Albe't?" [...] she asked, very patiently, as if he might be driven to further excesses, if not delicately handled. As soon as he had gone out of the room she wished that she had told him to give her time to dress and have her room put in order, before he sent the child up; but she could only make the best of herself in bed with a cap and a breakfast jacket, arranged {{with the help of a}} handglass. She had to get out of bed to put her other clothes away in the closet and she seized the chance to push the breakfast tray out of the door, and smooth up the bed, while she composed her features and her ideas to receive her visitor. Both, from long habit rather than from any cause or reason, were of a querulous cast, and her ordinary tone was a snuffle expressive of deep-seated affliction. She was at once plaintive and voluable, and in moments of excitement her need of freeing her mind was so great that she took herself into her own confidence, and found a more sympathetic listener than when she talked to her husband. As she now whisked about her room in her bed-gown with an activity not predicable of her age and shape, and finally plunged under the covering and drew it up to her chin with one hand while she pressed it out decorously over her person with the other, she kept up a rapid flow of lamentation and conjecture. [...] "I do suppose he'll <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>back</b> with her before I'm half ready; and what the man was thinkin' of to do such a thing anyway, I don't know. I don't know as she'll notice much, comin' out of such a lookin' place as that, and I don't know as I need to care if she did. But if the'e's care anywhe's around, I presume I'm the one to have it. I presume I did take a fancy to her, and I guess I shall be glad to see how I like her now; and if he's only told her I want some sewin' done, I can scrape up something to let her carry home with her. It's well I keep my things where I can put my hand on 'em at a time like this, and I don't believe I shall sca'e the child, as it is. I do hope Albe't won't hang round half the day before he brings her; I like to have a thing ova." ...|$|E
