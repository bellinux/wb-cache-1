It also included smaller numbers of two types of amphorae from Tripolitania (Libya) and Byzacena (Tunisia). All three types of vessel were used to transport olive oil. However, {{it is not clear}} why Monte Testaccio was built using only olive oil vessels. The oil itself was probably decanted into bulk containers when the amphorae were unloaded at the port, {{in much the same way}} as other staples such as grain. There is no equivalent mound of <b>broken</b> <b>grain</b> <b>or</b> wine amphorae and the overwhelming majority of the amphorae found at Monte Testaccio are of one single type, which raises the question of why the Romans found it necessary to dispose of the amphorae in this way.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A new {{strategy}} {{for increasing the}} low-temperature toughness of structural materials is in urgent need for overcoming the general rheotropic brittleness in coarse-grain state. Here, a unique phenomenon was observed that ultra-fine-grained (UFG) SiCp/ZL 108 composites after severe plastic deformation (SPD) exhibit higher impact toughness at temperatures slightly lower than room temperature. The enhanced impact toughness is attributed to the simultaneous increase of strength and ductility of UFG materials at lower temperatures, related to <b>grains</b> <b>or</b> <b>grain</b> <b>fragment</b> boundary modification. This result demonstrates the advantage of fabricating UFG materials by SPD method and spurs the interest to use UFG materials in low-temperature conditions...|$|R

In this method, the particles are of polygonal shape, and they split into polygonal cells once a certain failure criterion, depending on the forces exerted at the contacts, {{the size and shape}} of the grain, and the tensile strength of the material, is satisfied. The SCM is an improvement compared to other methods currently available in the literature, given that it does not restrict the shape of the <b>grains</b> <b>or</b> their <b>fragments,</b> mass is conserved throughout the fragmentation events, and it does not introduce artificial length scales in the system. In order to validate the proposed method, an experiment using plaster particles was conducted and its results were compared to those of a numerical simulation of the same system, finding a good match between both the experiment and the simulation...|$|R
60|$|Most {{pictures}} of the Dutch school, for instance, and excepting always those of Rubens, Vandyke, and Rembrandt, are ostentatious exhibitions of the artist's power of speech, the clear and vigorous elocution of useless and senseless words: while the early efforts of Cimabue and Giotto are the burning messages of prophecy, delivered by the stammering lips of infants. It is not by ranking the former as more than mechanics, or the latter as less than artists, that {{the taste of the}} multitude, always awake to the lowest pleasures which art can bestow, and blunt to the highest, is to be formed or elevated. It must be the part of the judicious critic carefully to distinguish what is language, and what is thought, and to rank and praise pictures chiefly for the latter, considering the former as a totally inferior excellence, and one which cannot be compared with nor weighed against thought in any way nor in any degree whatsoever. The picture which has the nobler and more numerous ideas, however awkwardly expressed, is a greater and a better picture than that which has the less noble and less numerous ideas, however beautifully expressed. No weight, nor mass, nor beauty of execution can outweigh one <b>grain</b> <b>or</b> <b>fragment</b> of thought. Three penstrokes of Raffaelle are a greater and a better picture than the most finished work that ever Carlo Dolci polished into inanity. A finished work of a great artist is only better than its sketch, if the sources of pleasure belonging to color and realization--valuable in themselves,--are so employed as to increase the impressiveness of the thought. But if one atom of thought has vanished, all color, all finish, all execution, all ornament, are too dearly bought. Nothing but thought can pay for thought, and the instant that the increasing refinement or finish of the picture begins to be paid for by the loss of the faintest shadow of an idea, that instant all refinement or finish is an excrescence, and a deformity.|$|R

40|$|The present work aims at {{identifying}} favorable {{locations for}} groundwater resources harvesting and extraction along the Wadi Feiran basin, SW Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, {{in an effort}} to facilitate new development projects in this area. Landsat ETM+, Radarsat- 1 and PALSAR images of Wadi Feiran basin were used in this work to perform multisource data fusion and texture analysis, in order to classify the wadi deposits based on grain size distribution and predominant rock composition as this information may lead to the location of new groundwater resources. An unsupervised classification was first performed on two sets of fused images (i. e., ETM+/Radarsat- 1 and ETM+/PALSAR) resulting in five classes (hybrid classes) describing the main alluvial sediments in the wadi system. Some variations in the spatial distribution of individual classes were observed, due to the different spectral and spatial resolutions of Radarsat- 1 (C-band, 12. 5 m) and PALSAR (L-band, 6. 25 m) data. Alluvial deposits are mixtures of parent rocks located further upstream often at a great distance. In order to classify the alluvial deposits in terms of individual rock types (endmembers), a spectral linear unmixing of the optical ETM+ image was performed. Subsequently, each class of the fused (hybrid) images was correlated with (1) individual rock type fractions (endmembers) obtained from spectrally unmixing the ETM+ image, (2) the geocoded and calibrated radar images (Radarsat- 1 and PALSAR) and, (3) the slope map generated from the SRTM data. The goal was to determine predominant rock composition, mean backscatter and slope values for each of the five hybrid classes. Backscatter coefficient values extracted from both radar data (C- and L-band) were correlated and checked in the field, confirming that both wavelengths produced more or less similar textural classes that correspond to specific <b>grain</b> <b>or</b> <b>fragment</b> sizes of alluvial deposits. However, comparison of the spatial distribution of matching hybrid classes showed some variations due to the greater discrimination power of surface texture by Radarsat- 1 C-band despite its lower spatial resolution. Furthermore, both hybrid classification results showed that regardless of elevation, areas that are covered by fine and moderate grains (fine sand to pebble) and are located along gentle terrains are favorable for groundwater recharge; while areas that are covered by very coarse grains (cobble to boulder) and are located along steep terrains {{are more likely to be}} affected by flash floods...|$|R

5000|$|.....The Red Mountain ores {{are known}} as a red fossil ore, because {{originally}} the iron accumulated in extensive beds of fragments of fossils, principally the hard parts of crinoids, bryozoans, and brachiopods. The iron, from solution in some form, was precipitated upon and within these beds of fossil fragments and thus the ore beds are simply {{a particular kind of}} sedimentary layers inclosed in ordinary sediments, shales, and sandstones, composing the bulk of the Red Mountain formation. As the fossil fragments were composed of calcium carbonate, which is the mineral that forms limestone, the iron ore beds at depth, where they are unweathered and where there has been no condition that permitted leaching of the lime content, carry a considerable percentage of lime, so that the ore is self-fluxing. Another type of ore is oolite ore, in which the iron oxide occurs in the form of small [...] pellets. The precipitation of the iron that forms this ore started around some minute particle like a small <b>grain</b> of sand <b>or</b> <b>fragment</b> of fossil and built up a small lenticular body.

40|$|We present {{noble gas}} {{analyses}} of sediment-dispersed extraterrestrial chromite grains recovered from similar to 470 Myr old sediments from two quarries (Hallekis and Thorsberg) and of relict chromites in a coeval fossil meteorite from the Gullhogen quarry, all located ill Southern Sweden. Both the sediment-dispersed grains and the meteorite Gullhogen 001 were {{generated in the}} L-chondrite parent body breakup about 470 Myr ago, which was also the event responsible for the abundant fossil meteorites previously found in the Thorsberg quarry. Trapped solar noble gases in the sediment-dispersed chromite grains have partly been retained during similar to 470 Myr of terrestrial residence and despite harsh chemical treatment in the laboratory. This shows that chromite is highly retentive for solar noble gases. The solar noble gases imply that a sizeable fraction of the sediment-dispersed chromite <b>grains</b> are micrometeorites <b>or</b> <b>fragments</b> thereof rather than remnants of larger meteorites. The grains in the oldest sediment beds were rapidly delivered to Earth likely by direct injection into all orbital resonance in the inner asteroid belt, whereas grains in younger sediments arrived by orbital decay due to Poynting-Robertson (P-R) drag. The fossil meteorite Gullhogen 001 has a low cosmic-ray exposure age of similar to 0. 9 Myr, based on new He and Ne production rates in chromite determined experimentally.
