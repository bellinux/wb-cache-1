5|$|The hull {{had four}} levels {{separated}} by three decks. The terminology for {{these in the}} 16th century was still not standardised so the terms used here are those that were applied by the Mary Rose Trust. The hold lay furthest down in the ship, right above the bottom planking below the waterline. This is where the kitchen, or galley, was situated and the food was cooked. Directly aft of the galley was the mast step, a rebate in the centre-most timber of the keelson, right above the keel, which supported the main mast, and next to it the main <b>bilge</b> <b>pump.</b> To increase {{the stability of the}} ship, the hold was where the ballast was placed and much of the supplies were kept. Right above the hold was the orlop, the lowest deck. Like the hold it was partitioned and was also used as a storage area for everything from food to spare sails.|$|E
5|$|The {{identification}} of the ship led to significant public interest in the salvage operation, and caused a great demand for the objects which were brought up. Though many of the objects could not be properly conserved {{at the time and}} subsequently deteriorated, many were documented with pencil sketches and watercolour drawings which survive to this day. John Deane ceased working on the wreck in 1836, but returned in 1840 with new, more destructive methods. With the help of condemned bomb shells filled with gunpowder acquired from the Ordnance Board he blasted his way into parts of the wreck. Fragments of bombs and traces of blasting craters were found during the modern excavations, but {{there was no evidence that}} Deane managed to penetrate the hard layer that had sealed off the Tudor levels. Deane reported retrieving a <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> and the lower part of the main mast, both of which would have been located inside the ship. The recovery of small wooden objects like longbows suggests that Deane did manage to penetrate the Tudor levels at some point, though this has been disputed by the excavation project leader Margaret Rule. Newspaper reports on Deane's diving operations in October 1840 report that the ship was clinker built, but since the sterncastle is the only part of the ship with this feature, an alternative explanation has been suggested: Deane did not penetrate the hard shelly layer that covered most of the ship, but only managed to get into remains of the sterncastle that today no longer exist. Despite the rough handling by Deane the Mary Rose escaped the wholesale destruction by giant rakes and explosives that was the fate of other wrecks in the Solent.|$|E

25|$|The Daysailer {{interior}} liner is a {{one piece}} moulding. It is not integral with the deck. No self-bailing {{is provided in}} this model. It is recommended that a boom-tent be used {{to reduce the amount}} of rain water getting into the boat. A <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> would also be a useful extra.|$|E
25|$|The deck or ship {{superstructure}} has not survived, {{although a}} baulk of timber and its supports as found, fitted carefully onto the lowest frames of the hull. This mast-step timber indicates sockets {{that correspond to}} a main mast, a foremast, of a <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> well, and of various interior architectural characteristics. Kept at a height of 1.10m above {{the floor of the}} hold, this well was 1.5m long by 1.25m wide and consisted of four vertical supporting cross-coated plates.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} five days of this patrol, U-68 came under a depth charge attack and was almost rammed by a Royal Navy {{destroyer}} south of Iceland. Merten later attempted to torpedo strangler and {{came into contact with}} a British convoy, which he lost again without shooting a single torpedo. When the main <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> failed, which impeded the U-boats diving ability, Merten decided to abort the mission and headed for France. On the journey to France, the starboard diesel engine failed {{and a member of the}} crew fell ill with pneumonia. U-68 arrived in Lorient on 1 August 1940.|$|E

500|$|All ships leak {{and require}} the regular {{operation}} of <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> to stay afloat. If their <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> {{could not be}} operated, the target ships would eventually sink. [...] Only one suffered this fate: Prinz Eugen, which sank in the Kwajalein lagoon on December 22. The rest were kept afloat {{long enough to be}} deliberately sunk or dismantled. [...] After the August 10 decision to stop decontamination work at Bikini, the surviving target fleet was towed to Kwajalein Atoll where the live ammunition and fuel could be offloaded in uncontaminated water. The move was accomplished during the remainder of August and September.|$|R
25|$|Fresh air {{for both}} the crew and engine was drawn into the tank via an 18m long rubber hose to which a float was {{attached}} to keep one end above the waterâ€™s surface. A radio antenna was also attached to the float to provide communication between the tank crew and the transport barge. The tank's engine was converted to be cooled with seawater, and the exhaust pipes were fitted with overpressure valves. Any water seeping into the tank's hull could be expelled by an internal <b>bilge</b> <b>pump.</b> Navigation underwater was accomplished using a directional gyrocompass or by following instructions radioed from the transport barge.|$|E
25|$|LCDR Bilderback's PBY had 15 {{survivors}} {{on board}} when it {{found itself in}} a dire situation: because of the missing APU and <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> the flying boat {{had taken on a}} lot of sea water and almost no power left to takeoff. The decision was made to transfer the survivors to the Bramble. Sea conditions worsened and after the successful transfer of all but two teenage survivors LCDR Bilderbeck's only options were to either abandon the flying boat or to attempt to taxi it back on the sea to San Juan Harbor. As they passed Fort El Morro and taxied into San Juan Harbor, the people lined the shore cheering the rescuers.|$|E
25|$|The BMD-3 {{is fully}} amphibious and is {{propelled}} by two water jets mounted one {{on either side}} {{at the rear of}} the vehicle, allowing the vehicle to achieve speeds of up to 10km/h in the water and in a sea state of up to three. A snorkel is erected from the driver's position and a trim vane is erected at the front of the vehicle when entering water and the automatic <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> is turned on. Unlike its predecessors, the BMD-3 can be airdropped with its all its crews and passengers inside the vehicle, allowing combat engagement to be immediate after landing. For the BMD-1 and BMD-2, the crew would be dropped separately, which required additional time to marry up with their fighting vehicle.|$|E
50|$|In September 2002, Priddy {{planned to}} return Spirit of Cardiff across the Atlantic. However, the boat's engine {{compartment}} had become flooded and the <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> were ineffective. Priddy abandoned {{the boat in}} Canada.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the usual feed and <b>bilge</b> <b>pumping</b> engines, the machinery department was fitted with oil lubricating pumps which serviced the turbine bearings, sanitary pumps, water heater, ash hoist and fresh water pumps.|$|R
50|$|Other items {{might seem}} obvious {{but are not}} {{actually}} required by law. They include a flashlight, first aid kit, paddles, whistles, anchor and rope, engine spare parts, <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps,</b> a VHF radio or mobile phone, etc.|$|R
25|$|The PT-76 is amphibious, {{it has a}} flat, boat-shaped hull {{which is}} hermetical and ensures minimal {{resistance}} when the tank is afloat. It can swim after switching on the two electric bilge pumps, erecting the trim vane which improves the vehicle's stability and displacement {{in the water and}} prevents water from flooding into the bow of the tank. Switching the driver's periscope for a swimming periscope enables the driver to see over the trim vane. When not in use the trim vane is stowed {{in the front of the}} bow over the barrel of the main gun and serves as additional armor. Bilge pumps keep the tank afloat even if it leaks or is damaged. There is a manual <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> for emergency use. The tank is propelled through the water by two hydrojets, one on each side of the hull, with the inlets underneath the hull and the outlets at the rear. There are also additional assistant water-jet inlets on both sides of the hull over the last road wheels. The rear outlets have lids that can be fully or partially closed, redirecting the water stream to the forward-directed outlets at the sides of the hull, thus enabling the vehicle to turn or go in reverse. To turn to the left for example, the left water-jet is covered, to turn to the right, the right water-jet is covered. To make a 180Â° turn, one water-jet sucks in water while the other pushes it out. This system was designed by N. Konowalow. It is the same system as the one used in the BTR-50 APC, which was based on the PT-76. The tank can swim at up to 10.2km/h and has a range of 100km. It can cross most water obstacles and can also swim in the sea. However, its amphibious design makes it disproportionally large for a vehicle of its weight and allows less armor protection than other light tanks.|$|E
2500|$|Both ships {{had several}} {{hand-operated}} bilge pumps that {{worked like a}} modern bucket dredge, the oldest example {{of this type of}} <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> ever found. The pumps were also operated by what may have been the oldest crank handles yet discovered; the reconstruction of the cranked pump which was assembled from fragments, including a wooden disk and an eccentric peg, has been dismissed as [...] "archaeological fantasy".|$|E
2500|$|Somewhere in the Indian Ocean, {{an unnamed}} man (Robert Redford) wakes to find water {{flooding}} his boat. He has {{collided with a}} wayward shipping container, ripping {{a hole in the}} hull. He uses a sea anchor to dislodge the container, then changes course to tilt the boat away from the hole. He patches the hole and uses the manual <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> to remove the water from the cabin.|$|E
50|$|The Delta Electric Company was an American {{electronics}} manufacturer {{formed in}} 1913 in Marion, Indiana (after moving from Chicago, Illinois) that produced lanterns, flashlights, automotive and bicycle lighting, battery tubes, horns, horn buttons, light switches, other battery-powered electrical parts, and <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Picket boat no. 41768, {{the future}} Darlwyne, was built [...] for the Royal Navy in 1941 in the Sussex Yacht Works yard at Shoreham-by-Sea. The hull, carvel built from African {{mahogany}} and rock elm, was [...] long, approximately [...] wide, with a draught at {{the stern of}} [...] Bulkheads divided the hull into fully watertight compartments, each equipped with a <b>bilge</b> <b>pump.</b> The vessel's original engine power was provided by twin Gardner 6LW diesel engines, each developing 95 horsepower. She was built to operate in harbours and estuaries, mainly in [...] transferring personnel between ship and shore, rather than for work in the open sea.|$|E
2500|$|Dale was {{transferred}} to the Maryland Naval Militia in 1895, and renamed Oriole on 30 November 1904. [...] Dale was struck from the Navy List 27 February 1906 and on 23 July 1906 she {{was transferred}} to the United States Revenue Cutter Service at Baltimore, MD. She, along with the Salmon P. Chase, served as a dormitory-barracks ship for the cadets in the School of Instruction at Arundel Cove, Maryland. [...] Due to open seams, Oriole required almost constant operation of her <b>bilge</b> <b>pump,</b> or she would sink at the dock. Finally, on 17 September 1921, almost 82 since her launch, Oriole was returned to the US Navy and sold as a hulk to Mr. William Mattson of Baltimore.|$|E
50|$|The Lynx is amphibious, {{propelled}} in {{the water}} by its tracks. Before swimming, a trim vane is erected at front, <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> started, and covers mounted on the air intake and exhaust. In practice, crews would close hatches and ford shallow streams at high speed.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} 1943 and 1944, seventy-seven LCM(4)s were built. Outwardly, the LCM(4) was almost {{completely}} identical to a late model LCM(1) - the difference lay inside the pontoon. Here special <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> and special ballast tanks allowed the LCM(4) to alter trim to increase stability when partially loaded.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{her life}} she was {{primarily}} used for swordfishing. In 1985 Hurricane Gloria touched down in the New England area and damaged {{the stern of the}} Goulart. Tied up to the wharf and retired, her engine was removed. At some point the <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> failed and the vessel sank.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, the F-111 and B-1A {{introduced}} {{the method of}} jettisoning the entire front fuselage {{as a means of}} crew escape. The crew remains strapped in the cabin, unencumbered by a parachute harness, while 27,000 lbf (120 kN) of thrust from rockets accelerates the module away {{from the rest of the}} aircraft. A single, large parachute retards the descent of the capsule. On landing, an airbag system cushions the landing. [...] In the event of a water landing the airbag acts as a flotation device. Additional airbags could be activated to right the capsule in the event of a water landing (similar to the Apollo capsule), or an additional airbag could be selected for auxiliary flotation. [...] With a movement of a pin at the base of the pilot's control stick, a <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> could be activated and extra air pumped into the airbags.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2007, {{mention of}} the Phoenix, gutted and minus both masts and its hand-carved Phoenix figurehead, showed up in an ad on Craigslist which began, [...] "FREE: 50-foot yacht[...] [...]" [...] John Gardner of Lodi, California, then 31, took {{possession}} of the Phoenix and had it towed up the Sacramento River, hoping to restore it {{and use it to}} rehabilitate young people recovering from substance abuse. During the journey, the yacht collided with a dock and had to be kept afloat {{with the help of a}} battery-powered <b>bilge</b> <b>pump.</b> In August 2010 the Phoenix went down off Tyler Island despite Gardner's efforts to keep it from sinking. In September 2010 Dr. Naomi Reynolds, granddaughter of the original Dr. Reynolds, took possession of the yacht, resting in 25 feet of water in the Mokelumne River. A diver inspected the vessel and found no serious damage. Peace activists are currently restoring the Golden Rule (2013) and plan to resume peace activities in it. They hope to raise funds to raise and restore Phoenix of Hiroshima next.|$|E
2500|$|Deep diving {{tests were}} delayed until the {{acquisition}} of the submarine rescue vessel Remora in December 1995. Collins performed her first deep dive on 19 January 1996 without any problems. However, during a later deep dive trial, the propeller shaft seal began to leak excessively. Although designed to leak at [...] an hour, the seal had previously shown itself to be faulty, with an hourly leak rate {{in the hundreds of}} litres. On this occasion, the water pressure meant the flow rate was significantly greater, {{to the point where the}} aft <b>bilge</b> <b>pump</b> was barely keeping up. When the senior engineer entered the compartment, he found personnel trying to stem the flow, including one sailor who was underneath the shaft, attempting to tighten the seal manually. The engineer instructed the commander to take the submarine to the surface as quickly as possible, but keep the boat levelâ€”had the engineer instead informed the commander that the submarine was flooding, Collins would have blown all ballast and driven for the surface at a steep angle, likely drowning the sailor under the shaft. Collins reached the surface without further incident. Modified seals were fitted to all submarines to bring the leak back to the accepted rate. It was later calculated that the submarine was taking on water at over [...] a minute.|$|E

5000|$|His actions {{during this}} {{encounter}} demonstrated his acumen. The ship had taken 85 hits {{in excess of}} five inches just above the water line and was leaking badly. At a key point during the effort {{to keep it from}} sinking, Schonland realized that the pumps for the second deck were inadequate to remove the water, but that the vessel had much higher capacity <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps.</b> So he called down to the engine room to arrange for all the <b>bilge</b> <b>pumps</b> to be pumping at full capacity, and the crew there ready for an immense amount of water. He then opened the hatches to the lower decks. This served the additional purpose of lowering the center of gravity of the ship, thus increasing its stability during the effort to save it. (John Carlton-Foss reporting a personal communication with Andrew Sims, Schonland's son in law) ...|$|R
