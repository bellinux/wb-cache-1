5000|$|The Volkswagen Beetle carried {{articulated}} running <b>boards</b> and <b>fenders,</b> but {{the subsequent}} Volkswagen Type 3 became {{known for its}} ponton styling; in the Netherlands the Volkswagen Type 3 (1961-1974) 2-door notchback sedan {{was referred to as}} the Ponton.|$|R

5000|$|The term ponton styling {{may have}} {{derived from the}} wartime {{practice}} in Germany of adding full-length tread armor along each side of a tank, attached primarily on the top edge—which resembled pontoons. As this roughly coincided with automobile styling trend where bodywork, especially running <b>boards</b> and <b>fenders,</b> became less articulated—with cars carrying integrated front fenders and full-width, full-length bodywork—the design took on the [...] "pontoon" [...] or [...] "ponton" [...] descriptor.|$|R
5000|$|The Fender Reverb Unit (6G15) was a tube, spring reverb-equipped effects unit made by Fender. The Reverb Unit was {{originally}} introduced in 1961. It was discontinued in 1966 {{and was replaced}} by a solid-state model, the FR1000. The unit features three controls: Dwell, Mixer and Tone and includes a 12AT7 tube as a preamplifier; a 6K6 tube as the reverb driver; and a 12AX7 as the reverb recovery tube. The rectifier is a diode-type solid state unit. The circuit <b>board,</b> like <b>Fender's</b> brown, [...] "blackface" [...] and [...] "silverface" [...] amplifiers is an eyelet board and the unit its completely hand wired. Physically the unit looks like a small amplifier head and since the early 1960s the unit has become synonymous with surf music.|$|R
5000|$|Subsequently {{the term}} pontoon fender took on another more {{prominent}} definition, {{derived from the}} wartime practice in Germany of adding full-length tread armor along each side of a tank, attached primarily on the top edge—and resembling pontoons. As this roughly coincided with automobile styling trend where distinct running <b>boards</b> and articulated <b>fenders</b> became less common—with cars carrying integrated front fenders and full-width, full-length bodywork—the fenders took on the [...] "pontoon fender" [...] nickname.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the years}} Courboin was {{involved}} in several serious auto accidents, some of which affected his career as an organist. The most serious of these occurred on October 10, 1926 when Courboin was driving home from the Hickory Presbyterian Church. Shortly after midnight as he travelled down a major boulevard he misjudged {{the direction of a}} trolley car that made a left turn crossing his path and suddenly found himself unable to stop. The trolley car collided with Courboin's Lincoln tearing off the car's left running <b>board</b> and <b>fender,</b> smashing the windshield and demolishing the top. Courboin suffered severe lacerations to the face, fractured his jaw, lost some teeth and came close to losing his life. He was hospitalized for a full week and was forced to cancel important concert engagements for several months.|$|R
50|$|In a {{departure}} from previous Lincoln vehicles, the bodywork featured no running <b>boards,</b> with the <b>fenders</b> and doors enclosed together; the Lincolns featured headlights and taillights recessed ("frenched") into the bodywork. At the time, the styling {{was referred to as}} a pontoon design. Using a feature that would later appear in the later Lincoln Continental sedan, all Lincoln-Mercury four-door sedans featured rear-hinged suicide doors. Alongside the four-door, the Cosmopolitan was sold as a two-door (in standard and Capri trim) and two-door convertible.|$|R
5000|$|A {{development}} of hot rodding, {{the change in}} name corresponded to {{the change in the}} design of the cars being modified. The first hot rods were pre-World War II cars, with running <b>boards</b> and simple <b>fenders</b> over the wheels. Early model cars (1929 to 1934) were modified by removing the running boards and either removing the fenders entirely or replacing them with very light cycle fenders. Later models usually had fender skirts installed. The [...] "gow job" [...] morphed into the hot rod in the early to middle 1950s.|$|R
