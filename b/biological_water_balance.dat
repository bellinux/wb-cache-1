External controls include elevation and isotopic lapse rates, temperature, atmospheric circulation patterns, aridity, and changes to precipitation seasonality, e. g., development of monsoons. Biological controls include temperature regulation and temperature-dependent <b>biological</b> activity, <b>water</b> <b>balance,</b> behavior, {{and rates of}} hard-part secretion and maturation. Some key factors include what sources of water an animal samples, how those sources respond isotopically to elevation, and the isotopic sensitivity of a biologic tissue to environmental changes. General research design criteria are enumerated, including numbers of fossils and analyses required, as well as uncertainties in the interpretability of isotopic shifts. Isotope zoning from fossil teeth and shells from the Indian foreland demonstrate comparable seasonal monsoon signals at ~ 11 Ma vs. today, implying a high and broad plateau at that time. Mean isotope compositions of fossil teeth from the lee of the Cascade Range, central Oregon, show a pronounced decrease in δ 18 O initiating ~ 7 Ma, signaling topographic rise associated wit...|$|R

In this paper, the long-term <b>water</b> <b>balance</b> items of the Poyang Lake have been analyzed to reveal the coupling effects of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and droughts on the <b>water</b> <b>balance</b> of Poyang Lake.

40|$|Urban <b>water</b> <b>balances</b> are {{generally}} unknown, {{yet they are}} necessary for assessing water availability in an urbanizing world and for understanding the effects of urbanization on the hydrologic cycle. We assess the spatial and temporal variability of <b>water</b> <b>balances</b> of 65 watersheds in the Baltimore, MD, metropolitan area during Water Years 2001 – 2009. Each <b>water</b> <b>balance</b> term is quantified independently and includes both natural (precipitation, evapotranspiration, streamflow) and piped (sewer infiltration and inflow [I&I], lawn irrigation, water supply pipe leakage) watershed inflows and outflows. The analysis also compares Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment storage data with changes in storage calculated using the residual between watershed inflows and outflows. We find that when considering only natural <b>water</b> <b>balance</b> terms, the <b>water</b> <b>balance</b> residual (inflows minus outflows) in-creases with urbanization, {{largely as a result}} of the decrease in evapotranspiration as modeled by the land surface model Global Land Data Assimilation System/ Noah. During wet years, the difference between urban and rural natural <b>water</b> <b>balance</b> residuals narrows because of increased urban streamflow. Excess water of the natural <b>water</b> <b>balance</b> in urban areas is largely exported by I&I into wastewater collection pipes; for some urban watersheds this excess is greater than gauged annual streamflow.

Data from the field experiment conducted from 1999 - 2002 was used to perform a <b>water</b> <b>balance</b> over pre- and post-thinning monitoring periods {{to gain a better}} understanding of the interaction of hydrologic components on drained forested organic soil watersheds.
