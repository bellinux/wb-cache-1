40|$|Do fiscal rules likely lead to fiscal adjustment, {{or do they}} {{encourage}} the use of ‘creative accounting’? This question is studied with a model in which fiscal rules are imposed on ‘measured’ fiscal variables, which can differ from ‘true’ variables because there is a margin for creative accounting. The probability of detecting creative accounting depends on its size and the transparency of the budget. The model studies the effects on fiscal policy of different rules, separating structural from cyclical effects, and examines how these effects depend on the underlying fiscal distortion and on the degree of transparency of the budget.

If improperly designed and managed, EBFs can undermine effective fiscal control. However, they also bring potential benefits in the form of greater autonomy of decision-making in countries with well-established governance and financial management systems that have applied the "agency model" of devolved public management and fiscal control. The paper develops a typology of EBFs and argues that EBFs are frequently created because of failures in the budget system and political economy factors that need to be recognized and, where possible, corrected. The paper recommends that data on EBFs be consolidated within a unified system of fiscal reporting and proposes an analytical framework that governments might use to evaluate the effectiveness and utility of their EBFs.

40|$|Each {{government}} {{engages in}} a full budget cycle involving the preparation of own budgets and supportive documents. In Bahrain, important administrative changes and major reforms have been implemented aimed at improving the overall efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, performance, accountability and sound budget management. This has been through State Budget Law No. 39 for the year 2002 which applies to all ministries and government organisations. The main {{purpose of this study}} is to identify, describe and analyse <b>budgetary</b> <b>accounting</b> practices and reporting requirements across Bahraini governmental units. The paper also contains a short description of the internal control reforms in Bahraini government departments. Questionnaire survey, structured and unstructured interviews and archival documents were used to collect the data. The results of the study indicate that <b>budgetary</b> <b>accounting</b> is the most important component of the accounting system in the government. Fund accounting is not used and the basis of accounting used is the modified cash basis. In preparing the budget, the line-item approach is used and questionnaire respondents are dissatisfied with this approach to budgeting. However, State Budget Law recommends that the necessary steps be taken to gradually implement performance and program budgeting beside line-item budgets. Moreover, encumbrances, budgetary revisions, and emergency budgets are used. In financial reporting, the statement "consolidated fund" maintains fiscal transparency. All revenues and expenditures get routed through the consolidated fund and controlled by the budget and no separate fund is permissible to credit receipts. Based on the findings, some recommendations for development and improvement are highlighted. In this regard, comprehensive implementation of performance and program budgeting is worthwhile for effective control on government expenditure, efficiency and accountability. Further, it is recommended that the accrual basis is introduced when preparing the government-wide budget.

However, the resources saved {{by a government}} that does not finance the upfront investment are offset by giving up future revenue flows to the concessionaire. If a PPP can be justified on efficiency grounds, the PPP contract that optimally balances demand risk, user-fee distortions, and the opportunity cost of public funds has a minimum revenue guarantee and a revenue cap. The optimal contract can be implemented via a competitive auction with reasonable informational requirements.
