40|$|The {{presence}} of a vertebral compression fracture is highly indicative of osteoporosis and represents the single most robust predictor for development of a second osteoporotic fracture in the spine or elsewhere. Less than one third of vertebral compression fractures are diagnosed clinically. We present an automated method for detecting spine compression fractures in Computed Tomography (CT) scans. The algorithm is composed of three processes. First, the spinal column is segmented and sagittal patches are extracted. The patches are then <b>binary</b> <b>classified</b> using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is utilized to predict whether a vertebral fracture {{is present in the}} series of patches...|$|E

40|$|A {{new version}} of the Catalogue of Eclipsing Variables is presented. The {{catalogue}} contains parameters and morphological types of light curves for some 7200 stars. Spectral classification is also given when available. Recently published information about classification of 1352 systems is also included in the catalogue. Thus, the catalogue represents the largest list of eclipsing <b>binaries</b> <b>classified</b> from observations. The analysis of stellar parameter distributions of catalogued eclipsing systems has been performed, and an algorithm of eclipsing-variable classification has been developed. Classification of some systems is troublesome or contradictory due to lack of modern observational data or their possible rare evolutionary class. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|Nowadays, the significative improments {{of remote}} sensing images have offered a better {{representation}} of intra-urban morphological patterns. However, high spatial resolution images {{have a great}} number of spectral noise, difficulting the discrimination of image objects. The analysis of image textural information is an alternative to minimize this problem. In this context, this paper verifies the capabilities of CBERS- 2 imagens on the differentiation of morphological patterns between areas with different inhabitability conditions. Initially, the spectral information of a CBERS- 2 image are enhanced and classified into two groups: occupied and non-occupied spaces. Then, the textural information of the <b>binary</b> <b>classified</b> image are calculated through a sliding box algorithm. Finally, the lacunarity values obtained are compared with values of a Inhabitability Index (IH) created from Census 2000 variables. The results show that, in general, non-occupied spaces are bettter distributed in urban areas with higher inhabitability conditions. Pages: 769 - 77...|$|E
40|$|The Mahalanobis-Taguchi (MT) {{strategy}} combines mathematical {{and statistical}} concepts like Mahalanobis distance, Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization and experimental designs to support diagnosis and decision-making based on multivariate data. The primary {{purpose is to}} develop a scale to measure the degree of abnormality of cases, compared to “normal” or “healthy” cases, i. e. a continuous scale from a set of <b>binary</b> <b>classified</b> cases. An optimal subset of variables for measuring abnormality is then selected and rules for future diagnosis are defined based on them and the measurement scale. This maps well to problems in software defect prediction based on a multivariate set of software metrics and attributes. In this paper, the MT strategy combined with a cluster analysis technique for determining the most appropriate training set, is described and applied to well-known datasets in order to evaluate the fault-proneness of software modules. The measurement scale resulting from the MT strategy is evaluated using ROC curves and shows that it is a promising technique for software defect diagnosis. It compares favorably to previously evaluated methods on a number of publically available data sets. The special characteristic of the MT strategy that it quantifies the level of abnormality can also stimulate and inform discussions with engineers and managers in different defect prediction situations...|$|E
40|$|Broad {{emission}} {{features of}} abundant chemical elements, such as Iron, are commonly {{seen in the}} X-ray spectra of accreting compact objects and their studies can provide useful information about the geometry of the accretion processes. In this work, we focus our attention on GX 3 + 1, a bright, persistent accreting low mass X-ray <b>binary,</b> <b>classified</b> as an atoll source. Its spectrum is well described by an accretion disc plus a stable comptonizing, optically thick corona which dominates the X-ray emission in the 0. 3 - 20 keV energy band. In addition, four broad emission lines are found and we associate them with reflection of hard photons from the inner regions of the accretion disc where doppler and relativistic effects are important. We used self-consistent reflection models to fit the spectra of the 2010 XMM-Newton observation and the stacking of the whole datasets of 2010 INTEGRAL observations. We conclude that the spectra are consistent with reflection produced at 10 gravitational radii by an accretion disc with an ionization parameter of xi 600 erg cm/s and viewed under an inclination angle {{of the system of}} 35. Furthermore, we detected for the first time for GX 3 + 1, the presence of a powerlaw component dominant at energies higher than 20 keV, possibly associated with an optically thin component of non-thermal electrons.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{technique}} for generating surface meshes from a uniform set of discrete samples. Our method extends the well-known marching cubes algorithm used for computing polygonal isosurfaces. While in marching cubes each vertex of a cubic grid cell is <b>binary</b> <b>classified</b> as lying above or below an isosurface, in our approach an arbitrary number of vertex classes can be specified. Consequently the resulting surfaces consist of patches separating volumes of two different classes each. Similar to the marching cubes algorithm all grid cells are traversed and classified according {{to the number of}} different vertex classes involved and their arrangement. The solution for each configuration is computed on base of a model that assigns probabilities to the vertices and interpolates them. We introduce an automatic method to find a triangulation which approximates the boundary surfaces- implicitly given by our model- in a topological correct way. Look-up tables guarantee a high performance of the algorithm. In medical applications our method can be used to extract surfaces from a 3 D segmentation of tomographic images into multiple tissue types. The resulting surfaces are well suited for subsequent volumetric mesh generation, which is needed for simulation as well as visualization tasks. The proposed algorithm provides a robust and unique solution, avoiding ambiguities occuring in other methods. The method is of great significance in modeling and animation too, where it can be used for polygonalization of non-manifold implicit surfaces. ...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced intra-arterial 3 D-MR-angiography (IA-MRA) of the infra-popliteal arteries in an open-bore magnet. Number, severity of arterial lesions, and artefacts {{were compared to}} routinely performed intra-arterial digital-subtraction angiography (IA-DSA) in patients suffering from symptomatic peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen patients admitted for PAOD underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) by IA-DSA. After PTA, IA-MRA of the infra-popliteal station was performed on an open-bore 1. 5 T MR-scanner applying a low dose intra-arterial contrast-enhanced 3 D-gradient-echo-MRA with gadopentate dimeglumine. The reading was performed by three blinded readers distinguishing moderate (> or = 50 %), significant stenoses (51 - 99 %) and vessel occlusions. Imaging artefacts were recorded and <b>binary</b> <b>classified</b> as not disturbing or compromising the observation of the arterial tree. RESULTS: Overall IA-DSA revealed 36 moderate stenoses (> or = 50 %), 38 significant stenoses (51 - 99 %), and 10 vessel occlusions. For the detection of significant stenoses and occlusions, the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of IA-MRA were 96 %, 83 %, 88 %, 94 % and 90 %. The only observed artefact was venous overlay in four stations. The readout was not hampered in any case. CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial contrast-enhanced 3 D-gradient-echo-MRA on an open-bore MR-scanner offers an acceptable diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing peripheral arterial occlusive disease in the infra-popliteal region and correlates well with DSA...|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of antimicrobial resistance data largely focuses on individual antimicrobial’s binaryoutcome (susceptible or resistant). However, bacteria {{are becoming increasingly}} multidrug resistant (MDR). Statistical {{analysis of}} MDR data is mostly descriptive often with tabular or graphical presentations. Here we report the applicability of generalized ordinal logistic regression model {{for the analysis of}} MDR data. A total of 1, 152 Escherichia coli, isolated from the feces of weaned pigs experimentally supplemented with chlortetracycline (CTC) and copper, were tested for susceptibilities against 15 antimicrobials and were <b>binary</b> <b>classified</b> into resistant or susceptible. The 15 antimicrobial agents tested were grouped into eight different antimicrobial classes. We defined MDR as the number of antimicrobial classes to which E. coli isolates were resistant ranging from 0 to 8. Proportionality of the odds assumption of the ordinal logistic regression model was violated only for the effect of treatment period (pre-treatment,during-treatment and post-treatment); but not for the effect of CTC or copper supplementation. Subsequently, a partially constrained generalized ordinal logistic model was built that allows for the effect of treatment period to vary while constraining the effects of treatment (CTC and copper supplementation) to be constant across the levels of MDR classes. Copper (Proportional Odds Ratio [Prop OR] = 1. 03; 95 %CI = 0. 73 – 1. 47) and CTC (Prop OR = 1. 1; 95 % CI = 0. 78 – 1. 56) supplementation were not significantly associated with the level of MDR adjusted for the effect of treatment period. MDR generally declined over the trial period. In conclusion, generalized ordered logistic regression can be used for the analysis of ordinal data such as MDR data when the proportionality assumptions for ordered logistic regression are violated...|$|E
