Roxxon executives proved receptive to Jaxon's ideas, and granted him a position as executive vice president. Paired with Delphine Courtney, a servitor robot disguised as a human woman, Jaxon set about plotting his revenge against Hudson by having Courtney recruit several superhuman castoffs from the discontinued Department H program: Diamond Lil, Wild Child, Flashback, Smart Alec, and Roger Bochs, creator of the Box robot. Diamond Lil, Smart Alec, and Wild Child had been part of Gamma Flight, and Flashback and <b>Box</b> <b>part</b> of Beta Flight. While the others were willing to go along with Jaxon's revenge plan, Bochs had no ill will toward Hudson, and chose to infiltrate the group, which Jaxon dubbed Omega Flight.|$|E

5000|$|To date, only episodes 3 and 4 do {{not exist}} in their {{entirety}} as was originally intended. Episode 3 is missing a visual brief bit of dialogue with Krimpton talking. This was replaced in the VHS release {{with a combination of}} a shot of WOTAN with the accompanied dialogue from the off-air recordings. Episode 3 is also missing around 59 seconds worth of the battle in the warehouse. This scene, however, has not been re-instated for the VHS release as it was felt that there wouldn't be enough visual material to drop into the gap. Episode 4 is missing only a small amount of material. The first instance occurs with the man in the telephone <b>box.</b> <b>Part</b> of the continuing close-up of the man talking on the telephone is missing, but this was compensated on the VHS release by continuing in audio-only {{over the top of the}} beginning of the high shot of the phone box.

The tomb is located above the choir stalls on the Gospel side and is in the Plateresque style. The <b>box</b> <b>part</b> is {{decorated}} with the shields of Castile and León, and the lower interior has three panels decorated with trophies. Above the three panels two cherubs hold a plaque on which is engraved the Monarch's epitaph:"AQUI IACE EL MUI TEMIDO Y JUSTICIERO REI DON ENRIQUE DE DULCE MEMORIA QUE DIOS DE SANTO PARAISO HIJO DEL CATHOLICO REI DON JUAN NIETO DEL NOBLE CAVALLERO DON ENRIQUE EN 16 AÑOS QUE REINO FUE CASTILLA TEMIDA Y HONRRADA NACIO EN BURGOS DIA DE SAN FRANCISCO Y MURIO DIA DE NABIDAD EN TOLEDO IENDO A LA GUERRA DE LOS MOROS CON LOS NOBLES DEL REINO FINO AÑO DEL SEÑOR DE 1407."

In this paper, the ETA/DYNAFORM finite element software was applied to simulate four different length-width ratio model of rectangular box. The simulating data shows that the rectangular box with short straight edge rebounded inward when the central of the long straight edge rebounded outward and near the corner part rebounded inward. The study had a very important guiding significance to the stamping process of rectangular <b>box</b> <b>part</b> and mold design...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: There {{are some}} {{complicated}} interactions among different stages in multistage machining processes (MMPs), {{so it is}} important and necessary to explore the inherent mechanism of machining error propagation for improving product quality. With respect to this issue, a machining error propagation network (MEPN) of MMPs is proposed and its complexity is discussed. In order to establish this MEPN, the machining form feature (MFF) of the work-piece, machine tool, fixture, and cutting tool (i. e. machining element, ME) are defined as dif-ferent network nodes. The associated relationship among different nodes is mapped by graph theory, according to the computer aided process planning (CAPP) information of the work-piece. Based on this, complex networks theory is introduced to analyse {{the characteristics of the}} established MEPN, and several measuring indices of error propagation at different nodes are proposed to quantify the interactions among different nodes. The synthesized propagation index (SPI) is then established to identify the key nodes and the SPI variation curve is used to quantify these key nodes ’ influences on the MEPN. Finally, a <b>box</b> <b>part</b> of a missile launcher is used to illustrate the proposed methods...|$|E
