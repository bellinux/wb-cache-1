5|$|Jaime Lannister and Bronn {{lead the}} Lannister army to Riverrun, where Lothar Frey and Walder Rivers attempt to coerce the <b>Blackfish</b> into {{surrendering}} the castle {{by threatening to}} execute Edmure Tully. The <b>Blackfish</b> calls their bluff and refuses to surrender. Disgusted with the Freys' incompetence, Jaime takes charge of the siege, orders Edmure to be bathed and fed, and attempts to parley with the <b>Blackfish,</b> warning him that the Lannisters will show no mercy to the Tullys {{if they do not}} surrender the castle. The <b>Blackfish</b> is not intimidated by Jaime's threats and dares him to try and seize the castle, declaring that the Tullys have enough provisions stockpiled to outlast a Lannister siege.|$|E
5|$|Jaime is {{informed}} {{about the death of}} the <b>Blackfish,</b> and sees Brienne and Pod escaping on the river. Both Jaime and Brienne mournfully wave each other farewell.|$|E

5|$|While Boone recovered, Shawnees kept {{up their}} attacks outside Boonesborough, {{destroying}} the surrounding cattle and crops. With {{the food supply}} running low, the settlers needed salt to preserve what meat they had, so in January 1778, Boone led a party of 30 men to the salt springs on the Licking River. On February 7, 1778, when Boone was hunting meat for the expedition, he was surprised and captured by warriors led by <b>Blackfish.</b> Because Boone's party was greatly outnumbered, Boone returned {{the next day with}} <b>Blackfish</b> and persuaded his men to surrender rather than put up a fight.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jaime {{talks with}} Edmure Tully, {{trying to win}} his {{cooperation}} by tempting him with seeing his newborn son, whom he has never seen, and offering to send {{him and his family}} to Casterly Rock, away from the Freys. Edmure ridicules Jaime and all of his past misdeeds, and asks him how he can live with himself. Jaime responds how he wants to take Riverrun to be back with Cersei, and he is willing to do anything to achieve it, even if it means killing every Tully he finds, including Edmure and his son. Jaime then sends Edmure to parley with the <b>Blackfish.</b> Despite the Blackfish's protests, the Tully soldiers allow Edmure entry into the castle. Edmure then orders his men to surrender Riverrun, and also orders the Blackfish's capture. The <b>Blackfish</b> helps Brienne and Podrick escape, but stays behind to fight to the end.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blackfish</b> {{wanted to}} {{continue}} to Boonesborough and capture it, since it was now poorly defended, but Boone convinced him that {{the women and children}} were not hardy enough to survive a winter trek. Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly to the Shawnees the following spring. Boone did not have an opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing to prevent an immediate attack on Boonesborough, however. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly that many of his men concluded that he had switched his loyalty to the British.|$|E
5000|$|During the American Revolutionary War, the Shawnee were {{military}} {{allies of}} the British and repeatedly battled the Americans. Following his father's death, Tecumseh's family moved to Chief <b>Blackfish's</b> nearby village of Chillicothe. They remained there until the Kentucky militia destroyed it in retaliation for <b>Blackfish's</b> attack on Boonesborough, Kentucky. Tecumseh's family fled to another nearby Kispoko village, but forces {{under the command of}} George Rogers Clark destroyed it in 1780. Next, the family moved to the village of Sanding Stone, which Clark and his men attacked in November 1782, and Tecumseh's family relocated to a Shawnee settlement near present-day Bellefontaine, Ohio. Some historians believe that witnessing the sacking of his childhood homes by the Americans was a catalyst to his drive to becoming a warrior like his father and older brother, Chiksika (Cheeseekau), and to be like [...] "a fire spreading over the hill and valley, consuming the race of dark souls".|$|R
25|$|On September 7, 1778, <b>Blackfish's</b> force arrived outside Boonesborough. Boone counted 444 Native Americans and 12 white men. The former {{were mostly}} Shawnees, {{with a number}} of Cherokees, Wyandots, Miamis, Delawares, and Mingos. The latter were French-Canadian militiamen from Detroit, former French {{subjects}} now fighting on behalf of the British Crown. Although this was the largest force yet sent against the Kentucky settlements, taking a fortified position like Boonesborough would still be difficult without artillery to reduce the stronghold.|$|R
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""The Broken Man" [...] gave us back The Hound, but his return felt a little diminished, given the parade of returns we've already seen this year, and there weren't as many notable moments in this chapter as other Game of Thrones episodes. There were some fine scenes, but nothing on par with the show's usual goods, though Lady Mormont was a {{highlight}} and Jaime and the <b>Blackfish's</b> standoff is an interesting scenario, {{not to mention the}} questions raised by Sansa's letter. Arya getting her guts punctured was a shocker, but it didn’t feel right that she couldn't see her attacker coming." [...] He gave the episode an 8 out of 10.|$|R
5|$|During Boone's absence, {{his wife}} and {{children}} (except for Jemima) had returned to North Carolina, assuming he was dead. Upon his return to Boonesborough, some of the men expressed doubts about Boone's loyalty, since after surrendering the salt-making party, he had apparently lived quite happily among the Shawnees for months. Boone responded by leading a preemptive raid against the Shawnees across the Ohio River, and then by helping to successfully defend Boonesborough against a 10-day siege led by <b>Blackfish,</b> which began on September 7, 1778.|$|E
5|$|In 1777, Henry Hamilton, a British Lieutenant Governor of Canada, {{began to}} recruit American Indian war parties to raid the Kentucky settlements. On April 24, Shawnee Indians led by Chief <b>Blackfish</b> {{attacked}} Boonesborough. Boone {{was shot in}} the ankle while outside the fort, but he was carried back inside amid a flurry of bullets by Simon Kenton, a recent arrival at Boonesborough. Kenton became Boone's close friend, as well as a legendary frontiersman in his own right.|$|E

Pixar's The Good Dinosaur was moved to the November 25, 2015 slot to allow more time for production of the film.|$|E
500|$|Mylod, {{spoke about}} the {{decision}} to show <b>Blackfish's</b> death off screen, saying [...] "there {{was a lot of}} tonal discussion about this, and I think I can safely speak for the writers that the choice was a conscious one in the writing not to see his actual death, because the emotional focus was really about the final moments between him and Brienne -- two warriors, two samurais, facing each other -- and Brienne's acknowledgment that this fellow samurai has chosen his moment, and this is his moment of dignity and choice of his death. So it was really about that moment of choice and the dignity and acceptance between these two great warriors, rather than the actual detail of his actual death.

During the march, he encounters his cousin Lancel, who admits to his affair with Cersei. Jaime persuades Edmure Tully to force the <b>Blackfish's</b> surrender by threatening to sack the castle and kill Edmure's child when it is born. Jaime later receives a letter from Cersei, who has been imprisoned by the High Sparrow and is awaiting trial and begs Jaime to be her champion in her trial by combat, but Jaime has the letter burned without reply.|$|R

5|$|Pilot {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} {{belonging to the}} genus Globicephala. The two extant species are the long-finned pilot whale (G. melas) and the short-finned pilot whale (G. macrorhynchus). The two are not readily distinguishable at sea, {{and analysis of the}} skulls {{is the best way to}} distinguish between the species. Between the two species, they range nearly worldwide, with long-finned pilot whales living in colder waters and short-finned pilot whales living in tropical and subtropical waters. Pilot whales are among the largest of the oceanic dolphins, exceeded in size only by the killer whale. They and other large members of the dolphin family are also known as <b>blackfish.</b>|$|E

At Riverrun, Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) unsuccessfully negotiates Sansa's request for help from the <b>Blackfish</b> (Clive Russell), and Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) returns Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) to the castle, with Edmure commanding they throw down their arms and surrender to the Lannisters. In King's Landing, Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) learns of her impending trial, and that she {{will not be able to}} demand a trial by combat by royal decree of King Tommen Baratheon (Dean-Charles Chapman). In Meereen, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) arrives, in the midst of an attack on the city by the wise masters of Yunkai, Astapor and Volantis.

5|$|Lord Walder Frey {{receives}} {{word that}} Riverrun has been retaken by Brynden Tully, {{commonly known as}} the <b>Blackfish,</b> Catelyn Stark's uncle and a staunchly loyal officer in Robb Stark's army. Walder chastises his sons Lothar Frey and Black Walder Rivers, who had been ordered to hold the castle. They defend their loss, as several Riverlords, including House Mallister and House Blackwood, have risen in rebellion against the Freys, and the Brotherhood Without Banners are raiding their supply lines and camps. Walder demands that the Tully stronghold be taken back, refusing to be humiliated by not being able to hold a single castle. He orders his men to bring in Edmure Tully, held as a prisoner of the Freys since the Red Wedding, and declares that they will use him to retake Riverrun.|$|E
5000|$|Brienne {{follows a}} group of Bolton {{soldiers}} sent to recapture Sansa, who had fled Winterfell along with Ramsay's slave Theon Greyjoy, and kills the soldiers before offering her services again to Sansa, who accepts. Brienne reveals to Sansa that Arya is still alive, though her whereabouts are unknown. Brienne, Podrick, and Sansa journey on to Castle Black (Theon having returned to the Iron Islands), where Sansa's half-brother Jon Snow has just resigned as Lord Commander. At Castle Black she encounters Stannis' former advisors Davos Seaworth and Melisandre and mockingly informs them that she killed Stannis and still blames them for their part in Renly's death. Also, a wilding, Tormund Giantsbane, takes a liking to Brienne, which she finds bothersome. Brienne escorts Sansa to meet with Littlefinger, who reveals that Sansa's great-uncle Brynden [...] "Blackfish" [...] Tully has captured House Tully's home Riverrun from the Freys. When Jon and Sansa leave Castle Black to gather men to overthrow Ramsay Bolton, Sansa sends Brienne to Riverrun to seek the <b>Blackfish's</b> support. Brienne claims Davos can't be trusted due to his former support for Stannis and then abandoning him, even though Davos only left on Stannis' orders.|$|R
40|$|The lower, potamonic {{parts of}} the Ganges–Brahmaputra, the Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy), the Salween, the Chao Phraya and the Mekong and Lancang Rivers are among the longest and most {{productive}} rivers for inland fisheries in the world. Except for the Chao Phraya, they arise on the Tibetan Plateau. All have steep and turbulent upper courses within deep mountain valleys and flat lower courses associated with large deltaic wetlands. Much of the riparian wetlands have been converted to rice culture. They all have rich and diverse fish faunas, comprising > 100 families, that are adapted {{to a wide range}} of river channel and floodplain habitats. Many species are migratory whitefishes, but more sedentary <b>blackfishes</b> are more important in the fisheries of some rivers. Fisheries may be commercial, artisanal or subsistence and employ a wide range of static and moving gear, some of which requires considerable investment. Most species caught are consumed. Larger fishes are sold for the table; smaller individuals are often processed into a variety of forms including dried products, fish pastes and sauces. Small, low-value fishes are also utilized for animal feed (mainly for aquaculture) sometimes after processing. There are a wide range of potential threats to the inland fishes and fisheries of Asia including dam development for hydropower and irrigation, overexploitation, pollution, land use change, mining, the introduction of invasive species, and water diversion for agriculture and other purposes. Fisheries are managed either as open access fisheries or lot fisheries which are assigned to particular groups on the basis of auctions. At present, management at local, national, basin and international levels is not meeting the needs of fish and fishery conservation and urgently needs to be reformed to better protect the fisheries in the face of mounting pressures from other users of the aquatic resource...|$|R

25|$|Over {{the next}} two days, {{settlers}} in the fort prepared for the siege. Based on faulty intelligence received from Hamilton in Detroit, <b>Blackfish</b> believed that {{there were at least}} 200 militiamen in the fort, when in fact there were only about 40 effective gunmen inside. The Kentuckians reinforced the illusion of a greater number of men by having some {{of the women in the}} fort carry weapons while dressed in men's clothing. On the evening of September 8, <b>Blackfish</b> and Boone met again.

25|$|The Siege of Boonesborough {{took place}} in September 1778 during the American Revolutionary War.
