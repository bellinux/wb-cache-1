25|$|Any {{family of}} sets that {{satisfies}} (2–4) is called a filter (an example: the complements to the finite sets, {{it is called the}} Fréchet filter and it is used in the usual limit theory). If (1) also holds, U is called an ultrafilter (<b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> add no more sets to it without breaking it). The only explicitly known example of an ultrafilter is the {{family of sets}} containing a given element (in our case, say, the number 10). Such ultrafilters are called trivial, and if we use it in our construction, we come back to the ordinary real numbers. Any ultrafilter containing a finite set is trivial. It is known that any filter can be extended to an ultrafilter, but the proof uses the axiom of choice. The existence of a nontrivial ultrafilter (the ultrafilter lemma) can be added as an extra axiom, as it is weaker than the axiom of choice.|$|E

It was relocated from Húsavík to Reykjavík's main shopping street at Laugavegur 116. Its former location in Húsavík is now home to The Exploration Museum. An offer from a wealthy German to buy the museum for ISK 30 million (US $232,000 / €186,000) and a proposal to move it to the United Kingdom were both turned down, as Hjörtur insists that [...] "the museum {{has to be in}} Iceland."

Sasha Fierce, {{as it is a}} ballad that shows Knowles' insecurities about love, and the person she is [...] "{{underneath}} all the makeup, underneath the lights and underneath all the exciting star drama". Knowles has said that she loves singing ballads because, [...] "the music and the emotion in the story is told [...] so much better. It's a better connection <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear it and it's not all these other distractions. I really wanted people to hear my voice and hear what I had to say."

500|$|Earthsuit {{music was}} {{primarily}} rock, but also possessed strong hip-hop, electronica, reggae, soul, and experimental elements. Their sound had sometimes {{been compared to}} The Police, while Meany's rapping had been likened to the Beastie Boys. Adam LaClave stated the differing musical tastes of the band helped cultivate their sound: [...] "Each {{one of us is}} really into {{a lot of different things}} ... it helps make our sound <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear all kinds of things". Live performances were characterized by [...] sunglasses, futuristic costumes, and energetic showmanship. Many bands have influenced Earthsuit's style; the group has performed covers of songs by Basement Jaxx, Black Sheep, Kraftwerk, and The Talking Heads. They have also utilized samples by DJ Shadow and The Verve.|$|E
500|$|After Mars {{was dropped}} by the label {{less than a year}} after being signed, he stayed in Los Angeles and landed a music {{publishing}} deal in 2005 with Steve Lindsey and Cameron Strang at Westside Independent. [...] Lindsey showed Mars and Jeff Bhasker (who Mars met through Mike Lynn) the ins and outs of writing pop music, and acted as a mentor helping them to hone their craft. Bhasker explained that Lindsey would [...] "mentor us, and kind of give us lectures as to what a hit pop song is, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have talent and music ability, but understanding what makes a hit pop song is a whole other discipline." [...] Mars played cover songs around Los Angeles in a band with Bhasker and Eric Hernandez, (Mars' brother), who is now The Hooligans' drummer.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Essence magazine, Beyoncé explained that [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] is [...] "broad" [...] and different from her previous releases {{because it is not}} a traditional R song. She added, [...] "I had to try it, because I remember Aretha Franklin said a great singer can sing anything and make it her own." [...] Beyoncé was also motivated by her audience's strong expectations from her as a singer. While preparing her third solo album, Beyoncé wanted to experiment with stronger lyrics and record ballads like [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] because, [...] "the music and the emotion in the story is told [...] so much better.

500|$|Eve's {{character}} and storylines initially elicited {{a positive response}} from Passions cast members. Johnson praised the show for its use of its African American characters like Eve. He appreciated the show's representation of [...] "a full African American family" [...] on daytime television with serious storylines, not [...] "just a flash in the pan". According to Johnson, the Russell family was also well-received by African American viewers. He said {{the chance to work}} with Tracey Ross, who he called the it girl for the African American community following her appearance on Star Search, influenced his acceptance of the role. Marshall commented on the absurdity of her character's rivalry with Eve, particularly their fight in the Crane mansion. She went on to praise Ross' acting, and said: [...] "t's a gift as an actor to have a good relationship with your scene partner when you're always the aggressor <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go where you need to go and not be afraid." ...|$|E
500|$|Aronofsky first {{discussed}} with Portman {{the possibility of}} a ballet film in 2000, and he found she was interested in playing a ballet dancer. Portman explained being part of Black Swan, [...] "I'm trying to find roles that demand more adulthood from me <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get stuck in a very awful cute cycle as a woman in film, especially being such a small person." [...] Portman suggested to Aronofsky that her good friend Mila Kunis would be perfect for the role. Kunis contrasted Lily with Nina, [...] "My character is very loose... She's not as technically good as Natalie's character, but she has more passion, naturally. That's what [...] lacks." [...] The female characters are directed in the Swan Lake production by Thomas Leroy, played by Cassel. He compared his character to George Balanchine, who co-founded New York City Ballet and was [...] "a control freak, a true artist using sexuality to direct his dancers".|$|E

Speaks five languages! I’ve got a 15-year-old boy from the Ivory Coast who speaks five languages!" [...] After Arsenal's defeat to Manchester United in February 1997 – a match marred by a bust up between Wright and Schmeichel, Wenger referred to Ferguson’s interference: [...] "I {{was surprised to see}} Ferguson on the pitch <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> only play eleven." [...] When Ferguson asserted that his team played the best football in England during the 2001–02 season, Wenger quipped: [...] "Everyone thinks they have the prettiest wife at home," [...] a subtle remark that Ferguson initially suspected was a taunt at his own wife Cathy.|$|E

Inventure added a third flavor, onion rings, in 2008. A second licensed product, the company's child-oriented BK Fresh Apple Fries, was licensed for sale in supermarkets in 2009 to the Cruch Pak company. The company stated that while the products are important in providing brand identity, they will not be concentrating their resources on them, and will be investing the licensing fees into the company's marketing fund. Industry pundits have criticized the company for this scheme, with Rob Frankel, author of the book The Revenge of Brand X, stating [...] "just <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do something does not mean you should." ...|$|E

500|$|As such, {{executive}} producer and writer Russell T Davies {{had to come}} up with a story that had a good reason to keep the Doctor and Rose out. Davies was inspired by the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode [...] "The Zeppo" [...] and the [...] episode [...] "Lower Decks", both of which focused on atypical characters. Davies described the episode, [...] "It's an experimental script. Not so experimental that people will run away screaming from Saturday-night BBC1, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> experiment too much. People still want a bit of a monster and a bit of a thrill and a bit of the Doctor, so it still delivers as normal Doctor Who. But just as you think you know everything this programme can do, this puts a little bit of spin on it." [...] The episode had the working title of [...] "I Love the Doctor". The acronym [...] "LINDA" [...] was previously used on the British children's television programme Why Don't You?, which featured the [...] "Liverpool Investigation 'N' Detective Agency". Russell T Davies worked on the series for some years.|$|E

According to Aguilera, the recording sessions were much longer than she thought. She further explained that lots of things came up during that time, including her first break-up with her first boyfriend Jorge Santos. Aguilera also believed that the lyrics of Stripped were so personal, and her vocals [...] "represent a rawer, more bare-bones approach as well, with less of the ostentatious riffing that has miffed critics in the past". She stated, [...] "I did the vocal gymnastics thing because it was fun. That's why I like blues, too, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> experiment more with that side of your voice. But I thought the lyrics on this record are so personal, deep and good that I wanted to make them stand out more than what I could do with my voice technically".|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with British radio station XFM, Björk explained its recording process, saying work on [...] "Oceania" [...] was kept being delayed {{because she wanted to}} do it especially for the Olympics. During the last day of mixing, she thought she needed [...] "sirenes", like in Greek mythology. She called up an English choir to record these sounds. The singer had done an arrangement for piano on the computer that was impossible for a piano to play, and she got them to sing it. Then, she also called up beatboxer Shlomo, who was recommended to her as [...] "the new bright hope of the hip hop scene". He went to record the next day and Björk asked him to do a techno tango beat, which he did. Recalling her work on the song until her last day of mixing, she commented, [...] "That was the most fun part, in the end. Sometimes it's good for you to work with a gun against your head and just go for it, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> sometimes sit too long with ideas.

500|$|Marshall based her {{understanding}} of Liz on the character's relationship with Eve, which served as the primary focus for her character development and story arcs. Liz was initially {{not included in the}} show's descriptions of Eve's past. In the 2001 tie-in novel , Eve is characterized as the only child of [...] "too-busy Harvard history Professor Warren Johnson and journalist Tanya Lincoln Johnson". Marshall felt Liz was irredeemable for her actions against Eve and her love interest Julian Crane. Interpreting the character as having a form of mental illness due to her repeated sexual abuse, Marshall said that [...] "very emotion she has it twisted". Ross added to Marshall's commentary by recommending that Liz should get [...] "some serious electroshock therapy". Marshall found Liz's rivalry with Eve to be absurd, particularly a scene in which they fight in the Crane mansion. She went on to praise her working relationship with Ross, saying: [...] "t's a gift as an actor to have a good relationship with your scene partner when you're always the aggressor <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go where you need to go and not be afraid." ...|$|E
500|$|Bono is {{credited}} as the album's sole lyricist. Thematically, the album juxtaposes antipathy towards the United States against the band's deep {{fascination with the}} country, its open spaces, freedoms, and ideals. Anger is directed particularly at the perceived greed of the Ronald Reagan administration and its foreign policy in Central America. Bono said, [...] "I started to see two Americas, the mythic America and the real America", hence the album's working title, The Two Americas. Having toured the US extensively in the past, the group were inspired by the country's geography. As such, the desert, rain, dust, and water appear as lyrical motifs throughout the record. In many cases, the desert {{is used as a}} metaphor for [...] "spiritual drought". One track that chiefly represents these themes is [...] "In God's Country", which critic Barbara Jaeger interpreted as addressing America's role as the [...] "promised land". Clayton explained the impact of the desert imagery: [...] "The desert was immensely inspirational to us as a mental image for this record. Most people would take the desert on face value and think it's some kind of barren place, which of course is true. But in the right frame of mind, it's also a very positive image, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> actually do something with blank canvas, which is effectively what the desert is." ...|$|E

It's unbelievable and appalling that they don't use it. ... And it's not that by using technology you lose the warmth and humanity of acoustic instruments, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> don't. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> still create a warm and human sound. The Young Gods did it on the L'eau rouge album and the Aphex Twin is doing it now."
