5|$|Aziziye {{was ordered}} in 1862, {{originally}} {{under the name}} Abdül Aziz. She was laid down at the Robert Napier and Sons shipyard in Glasgow in May 1863.

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{decommissioned}} in 1969, Tiptoe was {{the last}} active T-class submarine in the Royal Navy. As she arrived at Spithead for decommissioning on 29 August 1969, a 13-year-old ballet dancer named Judy Wright danced on her upper deck. She was sold in 1971 and scrapped at Portsmouth in 1975. Her anchor was saved, and was mounted on stone in 1979 in Blyth, Northumberland. The town {{was used as a}} training base for submarines during both World Wars.|$|E
5|$|Principe Amedeo {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Arsenale di La Spezia in August 1865, and her {{completed}} hull was launched on 15 January 1872. Fitting-out work proceeded very slowly, and the ship was finally completed on 15 December 1874. Obsolescent <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> completed, Principe Amedeo primarily served in the Italian colonial empire, which Italy had begun acquiring in the 1880s. She occasionally took part in training maneuvers with the main Italian fleet throughout her career.|$|E

5|$|Dodd {{has been}} around horses since she was four months old, {{and was able to}} ride on her own <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> two years old, before she learned to walk. The sport gave her a degree of independence. She started {{competing}} in 2005, and first represented Australia in 2006, winning her first test in England that year.In 2008, she became the youngest-ever winner of the Australian national championships. She finished first at the March 2009 inter-schools cup at the St Ives Showground, and second at the 2009 Australian national championships, but her horse, Lucifer's Dream, was injured in 2009. In 2009 and 2010, she searched for another horse to assist her in getting through Paralympic qualification. She won the Australian national championships again in 2011, along with the Oceania Championships and the National Titles team events. By 2012, she was the top-ranked Australian competitor in her event and class.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's {{marriage}} to Louis was celebrated in Buda on 20 June 1353. The couple were related within the prohibited degree of kinship, Duke CasimirI of Kuyavia being Elizabeth's maternal great-great-grandfather and Louis' maternal great-grandfather. A papal dispensation was thus necessary, {{but it was}} only sought four months after the wedding took place. The historian Iván Bertényi suggests that the ceremony may have been hastened by an unintended pregnancy, as the couple had been in contact for years. If so, the pregnancy likely ended in a stillbirth. Elizabeth's mother had apparently died <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> married. Louis was dismayed when, upon his father-in-law's death later the same year, Elizabeth's young and ambitious cousin Tvrtko ascended the Bosnian throne. In 1357, Louis summoned the young Ban to Požega and compelled him to surrender most of western Zachlumia as Elizabeth's dowry.|$|E
5|$|Fusō was {{commissioned}} on 8 November 1915 and {{assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 1st Fleet on 13 December. The ship did not take part in any combat during World War I, as there were no longer any forces of the Central Powers in Asia <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> completed. She served as the flagship of the 1st Division during 1917 and 1918, and patrolled {{off the coast of}} China during that time. The ship aided survivors of the Great Kanto Earthquake between 9 and 22 September 1923. In the 1920s, Fusō conducted training off the coast of China and was often placed in reserve. After assignment as a training ship in 1936 and 1937, she briefly operated in Chinese waters in early 1939.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, {{with the}} help of a friend, the then 28-year-old Ho set up shop in Chinatown with only a comb, a stool, and a {{kerosene}} lamp. She worked from 8am to 3am, charging five cents to comb hair or weave plaits and buns for amahs and Samsui women. She did that every day for almost three decades, interrupted only by periods when she was incapacitated by acute attacks of arthritis. She scrimped and saved, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in her 40s, she had enough to buy a shophouse in Club Street. Although illiterate, she made some property investments and eventually became a landlord, renting out rooms. As her wealth grew, she acquired more properties, and she began to adopt children from poor families, becoming a single mother of six daughters and twenty-five godchildren.|$|E
5|$|The keel for Palestro {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia {{shipyard}} in August 1865. The ship was named for the gunboat , which had been sunk at the Battle of Lissa in 1866. The date of her launch is unknown, though surviving records indicate either 30 September or 2 October 1871. The ship was completed on 11 July 1875, after almost a decade of work. Obsolescent <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> completed, Palestro primarily served in the Italian colonial empire, which Italy had begun acquiring in the 1880s.

5|$|Hamidiye was {{a unique}} ironclad warship built for the Ottoman Navy in the 1870s, the last vessel of the type {{completed}} for the Ottomans. She was a central battery ship, mounting most of her armament in a central casemate. The ship, built by the Ottoman Imperial Arsenal took nearly twenty years to complete; she was laid down in December 1874, launched in 1885, and completed in 1894. Due to her lengthy construction period, she was already obsolete <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> launched. Her poor handling and low quality armor contributed to a short career, spent almost entirely as a stationary training ship. She was briefly activated in 1897 during the Greco-Turkish War, but she was already in bad condition just three years after she entered service, as was {{the rest of the}} ancient Ottoman fleet. The Ottomans embarked on a reconstruction program after the incident humiliated the government, but Hamidiye was in too poor a state by 1903 to warrant rebuilding, and she was accordingly decommissioned that year, placed for sale in 1909, and sold to ship breakers in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Wild tigers {{that have}} had no prior contact with humans {{actively}} avoid interactions with humans. However, tigers cause more human deaths through direct attack than any other wild mammal. Attacks are occasionally provoked, as tigers lash out after being injured while they themselves are hunted. Attacks can be provoked accidentally, as when a human surprises a tiger or inadvertently comes between {{a mother and her}} young, or as in a case in rural India when a postman startled a tiger, used to seeing him on foot, by riding a bicycle. Occasionally tigers come to view people as prey. Such attacks are most common in areas where population growth, logging, and farming have put pressure on tiger habitats and reduced their wild prey. Most man-eating tigers are old, missing teeth, and unable to capture their preferred prey. For example, the Champawat Tiger, a tigress found in Nepal and then India, had two broken canines. She was responsible for an estimated 430 human deaths, the most attacks known to be perpetrated by a single wild animal, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> shot in 1907 by Jim Corbett. According to Corbett, tiger attacks on humans are normally in daytime, when people are working outdoors and are not keeping watch. Early writings tend to describe man-eating tigers as cowardly because of their ambush tactics.|$|E
5|$|Yamashiro, {{named for}} Yamashiro Province, the former {{province}} of Kyoto, was laid {{down at the}} Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 20 November 1913 and launched on 3 November 1915. She was completed on 31 March 1917 with Captain Suketomo Nakajima in command, and {{was assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 1st Fleet in 1917–18. She did not take part in any combat during World War I, as there were no longer any forces of the Central Powers in East Asia <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> completed, but she did patrol off the coast of China briefly during the war. On 29 March 1922, a Gloster Sparrowhawk fighter successfully took off from the ship. She aided survivors of the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, in September 1923. Little detailed information is available about Yamashiros activities during the 1920s, although she did make a port visit to Ryojun Guard District, in Manchuria, on 5 April 1925 and also conducted training off the coast of China.|$|E
