25|$|After the WSC splits {{off from}} the Norwegian Atlantic Current it begins to enter very cold {{atmospheric}} conditions. The cold atmosphere is able to cool the surface water, {{and in some instances}} this water cools so much that some of the WSC water actually sinks due to its density increase, all the while holding its salinity constant. This is one element of the formation of the Lower Arctic Intermediate Water. As the current continues to move northward and reaches the continental shelf of western Svalbard it begins to encounter sea-ice. The sea-ice melts due to the warmth of the WSC, and thus a surface layer of very freshwater <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist.</b> Winds mix the freshwater and the warm salty water of the WSC mix, creating some Arctic Surface Water. This Arctic Surface Water is now less dense than the Atlantic Water in the WSC and thus the WSC begins to sink underneath the Arctic Surface Water. At this point the WSC is still relatively warm and very saline. Thus, this allows the Atlantic Water in the WSC to be completely isolated from the surface waters.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{opponents of}} Warren's view {{believe that what}} matters morally is not that one be {{actually}} exhibiting complex mental qualities of the sort she identifies, but rather that one have in oneself a self-directed genetic propensity or natural capacity to develop such qualities. [...] In other words, what is crucial is that one {{be the kind of}} entity or substance that, under the right conditions, actively develops itself to the point of exhibiting Warren's qualities at some point in its life, even if it does not actually exhibit them because of not having developed them yet (embryo, infant) or having lost them (severe Alzheimer's). [...] Because human beings do have this natural capacity—and indeed have it essentially—therefore (on this view) they essentially have a right to life: they could not possibly fail to have a right to life. Further, since modern embryology shows that the embryo <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> at conception and has a natural capacity for complex mental qualities, therefore the right to life begins at conception.|$|E

60|$|To conclude: Whatever {{substance}} <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist,</b> it must, {{during its}} existence, necessarily be the same: whatever compositions of substances begin to exist, during {{the union of}} those substances, the concrete must be the same: whatsoever mode <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist,</b> during its existence it is the same: and so if the composition be of distinct substances and different modes, the same rule holds. Whereby it will appear, that the difficulty or obscurity that has been about this matter rather rises from the names ill-used, than from any obscurity in things themselves. For whatever makes the specific idea to which the name is applied, if that idea be steadily kept to, the distinction of anything into the same and divers will easily be conceived, and there can arise no doubt about it.|$|E
6000|$|Now the [...] "first cause" [...] {{is assumed}} to have existed from all eternity, up to the moment at which the {{universe}} came into existence. Hence it cannot be the sole cause of the universe; in fact, it was no cause at all until it was [...] "assisted by some other principle"; consequently the so-called [...] "first cause," [...] {{so far as it}} produces the universe, is in reality an effect of that other principle. Moreover, though, in the person of Philo, Hume assumes the axiom [...] "that whatever <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> must have a cause," [...] which he denies in the Treatise, he must have seen, for a child may see, that the assumption is of no real service.|$|E

So far from the axiom, that whatever <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> must have a cause of existence, being [...] "self-evident," [...] as Philo calls it, Hume spends the greatest care in showing that it is nothing but the product of custom, or experience.|$|E

6000|$|... § 1. It {{results from}} the {{preceding}} exposition, {{that the process of}} ascertaining what consequents, in nature, are invariably connected with what antecedents, or in other words what phenomena are related to each other as causes and effects, is in some sort a process of analysis. That every fact which <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> has a cause, and that this cause must be found in some fact or concourse of facts which immediately preceded the occurrence, may be taken for certain. The whole of the present facts are the infallible result of all past facts, and more immediately of all the facts which existed at the moment previous. Here, then, is a great sequence, which we know to be uniform. If the whole prior state of the entire universe could again recur, it would again be followed by the present state. The question is, how to resolve this complex uniformity into the simpler uniformities which compose it, and assign to each portion of the vast antecedent the portion of the consequent which is attendant on it.|$|E
60|$|The {{mind being}} every day informed, by the senses, of the {{alteration}} of those simple ideas it observes in things without; and taking notice how one {{comes to an}} end, and ceases to be, and another <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> which was not before; reflecting also on what passes within itself, and observing a constant change of its ideas, sometimes by the impression of outward objects on the senses, and sometimes by the determination of its own choice; and concluding from what it has so constantly observed to have been, that the like changes will for the future {{be made in the}} same things, by like agents, and by the like ways,--considers in one thing the possibility of having any of its simple ideas changed, and in another the possibility of making that change; and so comes by that idea which we call POWER. Thus we say, Fire has a power to melt gold, i. e. to destroy the consistency of its insensible parts, and consequently its hardness, and make it fluid; and gold has a power to be melted; that the sun has a power to blanch wax, and wax a power to be blanched by the sun, whereby the yellowness is destroyed, and whiteness made to exist in its room. In which, and the like cases, the power we consider is in reference to the change of perceivable ideas. For we cannot observe any alteration to be made in, or operation upon anything, but by the observable change of its sensible ideas; nor conceive any alteration to be made, but by conceiving a change of some of its ideas.|$|E
6000|$|There is, no doubt, a {{tendency}} (which our first example, that {{of death from}} taking a particular food, sufficiently illustrates) to associate the idea of causation with the proximate antecedent event, rather than {{with any of the}} antecedent states, or permanent facts, which may happen also to be conditions of the phenomenon; the reason being that the event not only exists, but <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> immediately previous; while the other conditions may have pre-existed for an indefinite time. And this tendency shows itself very visibly in the different logical fictions which are resorted to, even by men of science, to avoid the necessity of giving the name of cause to any thing which had existed for an indeterminate length of time before the effect. Thus, rather than say that the earth causes the fall of bodies, they ascribe it to a force exerted by the earth, or an attraction by the earth, abstractions which they can represent to themselves as exhausted by each effort, and therefore constituting at each successive instant a fresh fact, simultaneous with, or only immediately preceding, the effect. Inasmuch as the coming of the circumstance which completes the assemblage of conditions, is a change or event, it thence happens that an event is always the antecedent in closest apparent proximity to the consequent: and this may account for the illusion which disposes us to look upon the proximate event as standing more peculiarly in the position of a cause than any of the antecedent states. But even this peculiarity, of being in closer proximity to the effect than any other of its conditions, is, as we have already seen, far from being necessary to the common notion of a cause; with which notion, on the contrary, any one of the conditions, either positive or negative, is found, on occasion, completely to accord.(114) ...|$|E

60|$|The law {{of cause}} and effect, being thus certain, is capable of imparting its {{certainty}} to all other inductive propositions which can be deduced from it; and the narrower inductions may be regarded as receiving their ultimate sanction from that law, {{since there is no}} one of them which is not rendered more certain than it was before, when we are able to connect it with that larger induction, and to show {{that it can not be}} denied, consistently with the law that every thing which <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> has a cause. And hence we are justified in the seeming inconsistency, of holding induction by simple enumeration to be good for proving this general truth, the foundation of scientific induction, and yet refusing to rely on it for any of the narrower inductions. I fully admit that if the law of causation were unknown, generalization in the more obvious cases of uniformity in phenomena would nevertheless be possible, and though in all cases more or less precarious, and in some extremely so, would suffice to constitute a certain measure of probability; but what the amount of this probability might be, we are dispensed from estimating, since it never could amount to the degree of assurance which the proposition acquires, when, by the application to it of the Four Methods, the supposition of its falsity is shown to be inconsistent with the Law of Causation. We are therefore logically entitled, and, by the necessities of scientific induction, required, to disregard the probabilities derived from the early rude method of generalizing, and to consider no minor generalization as proved except so far as the law of causation confirms it, nor probable except so far as it may reasonably be expected to be so confirmed.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{somewhat}} amusing, indeed, {{to notice the}} difference between the fate of these three paradoxes in the fashion of the modern mind. Charity is a fashionable virtue in our time; it is lit up by the gigantic firelight of Dickens. Hope is a fashionable virtue to-day; our attention has been arrested for it by the sudden and silver trumpet of Stevenson. But faith is unfashionable, and it is customary on every side to cast against it {{the fact that it is}} a paradox. Everybody mockingly repeats the famous childish definition that faith is [...] "the power of believing that which we know to be untrue." [...] Yet it is not one atom more paradoxical than hope or charity. Charity is the power of defending that which we know to be indefensible. Hope is the power of being cheerful in circumstances which we know to be desperate. It is true that there is a state of hope which belongs to bright prospects and the morning; but that is not the virtue of hope. The virtue of hope exists only in earthquake and, eclipse. It is true that there is a thing crudely called charity, which means charity to the deserving poor; but charity to the deserving is not charity at all, but justice. It is the undeserving who require it, and the ideal either does not exist at all, or exists wholly for them. For practical purposes it is at the hopeless moment that we require the hopeful man, and the virtue either does not exist at all, or <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> at that moment. Exactly at the instant when hope ceases to be reasonable it begins to be useful. Now the old pagan world went perfectly straightforward until it discovered that going straightforward is an enormous mistake. It was nobly and beautifully reasonable, and discovered in its death-pang this lasting and valuable truth, a heritage for the ages, that reasonableness will not do. The pagan age was truly an Eden or golden age, in this essential sense, that it is not to be recovered. And it is not to be recovered in this sense again that, while we are certainly jollier than the pagans, and much more right than the pagans, there is not one of us who can, by the utmost stretch of energy, be so sensible as the pagans. That naked innocence of the intellect cannot be recovered by any man after Christianity; and for this excellent reason, that every man after Christianity knows it to be misleading. Let me take an example, the first that occurs to the mind, of this impossible plainness in the pagan point of view. The greatest tribute to Christianity in the modern world is Tennyson's [...] "Ulysses." [...] The poet reads into the story of Ulysses the conception of an incurable desire to wander. But the real Ulysses does not desire to wander at all. He desires to get home. He displays his heroic and unconquerable qualities in resisting the misfortunes which baulk him; but that is all. There is no love of adventure for its own sake; that is a Christian product. There is no love of Penelope for her own sake; that is a Christian product. Everything in that old world would appear to have been clean and obvious. A good man was a good man; a bad man was a bad man. For this reason they had no charity; for charity is a reverent agnosticism towards the complexity of the soul. For this reason they had no such thing as the art of fiction, the novel; for the novel is a creation of the mystical idea of charity. For them a pleasant landscape was pleasant, and an unpleasant landscape unpleasant. Hence they had no idea of romance; for romance consists in thinking a thing more delightful because it is dangerous; it is a Christian idea. In a word, we cannot reconstruct or even imagine the beautiful and astonishing pagan world. It was a world in which common sense was really common.|$|E

The purpose of this paper is to show what is wrong with Smith's argument. According to Smith, Hawking's cosmological theory includes what Smith calls "Hawking's wave function law.

(1) The unconditional probability that a universe like this one- i. e., a universe with the metric hij and matter field Φ- should <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> is 95 %. 2 Smith then argues that the theist who accepts HL must also accept that the following sentence was once true. 3 (2) God wills that Hawking's wave function law obtains and that a universe <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> with the metric hij and matter field Φ. For if God did not will that HL obtains, then HL would not obtain; and similarly, if God did not will that a universe <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> with the metric hij and matter field Φ, then such a universe 1 For Smith's argument see [3].
