In flexible batteries all these components need to be flexible. These batteries can be fabricated into different shapes and sizes and by different methods. One approach is to use polymer binders to fabricate composite electrodes where conductive additives are added to enhance their conductivity. The electrode materials can be printed or coated onto flexible substrates. The cells are assembled into flexible packaging materials to maintain <b>bendability.</b> Others approaches include the filtering of electrode suspension through filters to form free-standing films, or use flexible matrix to hold electrode materials.

The P. putida KT2440 chromosome is characterized by strand symmetry and intrastrand parity of complementary oligonucleotides. Each tetranucleotide occurs with similar frequency on the two strands. Tetranucleotide usage is biased by G+C content and physicochemical constraints such as base stacking energy, dinucleotide propeller twist angle, or trinucleotide <b>bendability.</b> The 105 regions with atypical oligonucleotide composition can be differentiated by their patterns of oligonucleotide usage into categories of horizontally acquired gene islands, multidomain genes or ancient regions such as genes for ribosomal proteins and RNAs. A species-specific extragenic palindromic sequence is the most common repeat in the genome that can be exploited for the typing of P. putida strains. In the coding sequence of P. putida, LLL is the most abundant tripeptide.|$|E

Although it was praised for its performance and battery life, the G Flex's hardware and software were also panned for being too similar to the G2, with its software in particular being criticized for not containing any features specifically intended {{to take advantage of the}} curved screen (besides the lock screen wallpaper tilting along with the phone), and for the removal of optical image stabilization from the camera.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{commonly}} used stretchable energy storage device {{is based on}} active materials for double-layer supercapacitors are carbon-based materials such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs),due to their excellent electrical conductivity and high surface areas. The carbon-based materials are also natural choices for stretchable supercapacitors, with proper structural engineering to impart stretchability to the devices. Most recent study by Li et al. shows the fully functionality of the stretchable supercapacitor under dynamic charging and discharging, for the first time, which is composed of both elastic PDMS substrates, buckled SWCNTs macrofilm and elastomeric separators. Although achieving excellent cycling stability, however, the key drawback of this stretchable energy storage based on supercapacitor technology is the low specific capacitance and energy density and this can potentially be improved by the incorporation of redox materials, for example the SWNT/MnO2 electrode. Another approach to creating stretchable energy storage device {{is the use of}} Origami folding principle. The resulting origami battery achieves significant linear and areal deformability, large twistability and <b>bendability.</b> The strategy described here represents the fusion of the art of origami, materials science and functional energy storage devices, and could provide a paradigm shift for architecture and design of flexible and curvilinear electronics with exceptional mechanical characteristics and functionalities ...|$|E
50|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, mtDNA {{is inserted}} into the nuclear genome only when a DSB is produced by endogenous or exogenous damaging factors. However, mtDNA is not inserted at any location within the genome. Moreover, there is no correlation between the fraction of noncoding DNA and NUMT abundance; In addition, Antunes and Ramos found that old NUMTs are inserted preferentially into the known and predicted loci, as inferred for recent NUMTs in the human genome, during their vigorous work on NUMT sequence in fishes using BLASTN analysis method. Therefore, based on these studies, the insertion of NUMT in nuclear genome {{is found to be}} non-random. One of the best studies proving the non-random distribution and insertion of NUMTs in the nuclear genome is done by Tsuji and his teammates. Using the LAST method instead of BLAST, which makes computing E-value with higher accuracy possible and does not under-represent the repetitive elements in NUMT flanks, Tsuji and his teammate became able to characterize the location of NUMT insertion precisely. They found out that NUMT fragments tend to be inserted in the regions with high local DNA curvature or <b>bendability</b> and high A+T rich oligomers, especially TAT. Moreover, NUMTs are mostly inserted into open chromatin regions. Using the same method, Tsuji showed that NUMTs are not usually clustered together and the NUMTs produced by D-loop are usually under-represented which evident more vividly in monkey and human compare to rats and mouse due to the total length of their NUMTs. However Tsuji also found that retrotransposon structure is highly enriched in NUMT flanks and most NUMTs are inserted in close proximity of retrotransposon while only a few, 10 out of 557 NUMTs, were inserted within a retrotransposon, they could not find any clear relation the size of non-coding DNA and the number of NUMT.|$|E
30|$|To {{improve the}} <b>bendability</b> of {{flexible}} nanoelectronics, a buffer layer {{has been adopted}} [3, 6, 9, 15]. Researchers have reported that the mechanical <b>bendability</b> of electronic nanodevices can be increased by using a buffer layer above or below the ITO layer. However, they did not suggest an optimized design rule that considers both the thickness and elastic modulus of the buffer material. Because various buffer layers {{could be used to}} increase the thermal, chemical, and mechanical stabilities of flexible electronic nanodevices, a governing design rule is crucially needed to optimize the <b>bendability</b> of these flexible nanodevices regardless of the buffer layers that are chosen. In this article, we report a design rule for the <b>bendability</b> optimization of flexible optical nanoelectronics through controlling the neutral axis (NA). If we place the fragile layer such as ITO in a nanodevice at the NA position, the bending stress and strain in the layer are greatly reduced, thus enhancing the <b>bendability</b> of the device. Therefore, we first investigate the behavior of the NA position and the effect on the device <b>bendability</b> by independently considering the elastic modulus and thickness of a buffer layer on the ITO. Because the elastic modulus and thickness of a buffer layer influenced each other when determining the NA, we should consider these parameters together. Therefore, we develop a design rule for the <b>bendability</b> optimization of flexible electronics by controlling the NA position, considering both the thickness and elastic modulus of the buffer layer. Finally, our design rule to optimize the <b>bendability</b> of flexible devices is applied to an inverted OSC with an ITO optical window. We believe that our design rule based on NA engineering will provide a great advantage to improve the <b>bendability</b> of flexible nanoelectronics.|$|E

Many reports about the improvement in the <b>bendability</b> of Al-Mg-Si alloys applied a T 4 temper have been published, because they easily crack during the hemming process. On the other hand, Al-Mg-Si alloys applied T 6 and T 7 tempers are used as the material of wiring plates and heat radiation devices. A high electrical conductivity and good <b>bendability</b> are necessary for these devices. In this study, the effect of the aging conditions on the <b>bendability</b> was investigated. As a result, the <b>bendability</b> in the T 6 temper significantly decreased. The <b>bendability</b> in the underaged temper, and in the overaged temper was better than that at the T 6 temper.

30|$|The {{enhancement}} of <b>bendability</b> of flexible nanoelectronics {{is critically important}} to realize future portable and wearable nanoelectronics for personal and military purposes. Because {{there is an enormous}} variety of materials and structures that are used for flexible nanoelectronic devices, a governing design rule for optimizing the <b>bendability</b> of these nanodevices is required. In this article, we suggest a design rule to optimize the <b>bendability</b> of flexible nanoelectronics through neutral axis (NA) engineering. In flexible optical nanoelectronics, transparent electrodes such as indium tin oxide (ITO) are usually the most fragile under an external load because of their brittleness. Therefore, we representatively focus on the <b>bendability</b> of ITO which has been widely used as transparent electrodes, and the NA is controlled by employing a buffer layer on the ITO layer. First, we independently investigate the effect of the thickness and elastic modulus of a buffer layer on the <b>bendability</b> of an ITO film. Then, we develop a design rule for the <b>bendability</b> optimization of flexible optical nanoelectronics. Because NA is determined by considering both the thickness and elastic modulus of a buffer layer, the design rule is conceived to be applicable regardless of the material and thickness that are used for the buffer layer. Finally, our design rule is applied to optimize the <b>bendability</b> of an organic solar cell, which allows the bending radius to reach about 1 [*]mm. Our design rule is thus expected to provide a great strategy to enhance the bending performance of a variety of flexible nanoelectronics.|$|E

It is necessary to understand the behavior of these materials in common forming processes such as air bending. It is known that the <b>bendability</b> of ultra-high strength steels is lower than other high-strength steels but what are yet to be discovered are the parameters that define the limits of <b>bendability</b> of these steels.

40|$|The {{correlation}} between the fibre flexibility and cross-sectional area moment of inertia of thermomechanical pulp fibres was investigated. The main effects of refining {{were found to be}} internal fibrillation, external fibrillation, and fibre shortening. Internal fibrillation increases fibre flexibility and fibre collapsibility, improving fibre-to-fibre contact in a paper sheet. The raw materials used were pulps produced from six different Norway spruce logs and six different Scots pine logs, chosen in a manner that allowed variation of fibre wall thickness and fibril angle independently. Each wood sample was refined in four stages using a pressurized 12 " Sprout Waldron single disc refiner. Fibre flexibility was assessed by FiberMaster <b>bendability</b> measurements. Fibre <b>bendability</b> was measured on the + 48 Bauer McNett fractions of the twelve 2 nd, 3 rd, and 4 th stage thermomechanical pulps (TMP). The fibre cross-sectional samples were imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). An image analysis method to calculate the area moment of inertia of each fibre using numerical integration was developed. Fiber <b>bendability</b> increased with specific energy consumption for both wood species (spruce and pine) from the 2 nd refining stage to the fourth refining stage. Spruce had a higher rate of <b>bendability</b> increase than pine upon refining. It was expected that fibres with a low area moment of inertia would result in higher <b>bendability,</b> but no such correlation was found for either spruce or pine. Fibre <b>bendability</b> increased with internal fibrillation, as assessed from Simons staining.

40|$|This master thesis {{work has}} been carried out at the company SSAB EMEA in Oxelösund which is a global leader in {{quenched}} and tempered high-strength steel. The aim is to examine the importance of the material properties for the <b>bendability</b> of the specific steel grade Weldox. There are many conditions for various applications such as mobile cranes and vehicles that need to be fulfilled in order for the material to be approved, where one main prerequisite is the <b>bendability.</b> It is very important to be able to bend the material without the occurrence of cracks. The purpose of this work has therefore been to investigate and try to find the relationship between the material properties and the critical bending radius. Furthermore has another aim been to find the most suitable treatment process for the composition of this specific steel grade. The work was divided into two parts, where the first part was to examine two equally treated Weldox 960 plates that differed significantly in properties such as <b>bendability</b> and toughness. In the second part seven different plates of the steel grade Weldox 1100 have been investigated where all the plates were treated in various ways. The leveling of the plates was performed in two different ways; either according to the standard leveling or to the property affected leveling (ERIK). The experimental part includes tests such as bending, hardness, toughness, tensile and inclusions measurements. The results have shown that the most significant material properties affecting the <b>bendability</b> are the yield strength and the purity close to the plate surface. Leveling with ERIK as the last treatment step has shown that the toughness of the material can be increased but it does not affect the <b>bendability</b> for these specific steel grades. Other properties such as hardness, ultimate tensile strength and elongation have no major impact on the <b>bendability</b> for this specific composition.

40|$|A new {{explanation}} {{for the emergence of}} heavy (GC-rich) isochores is proposed, based on the study of thermostability, <b>bendability,</b> ability to B±Z transition and curvature of the DNA helix. The absolute values of thermostability, <b>bendability</b> and ability to B±Z transition correlated positively with GC content, whereas curvature correlated negatively. The rela-tive values of these parameters were determined as compared to randomized sequences. In genes and intergenic spacers of warm-blooded animals, both the relative <b>bendability</b> and ability to B±Z transition increased with elevation of GC content, whereas the relative thermostability and curvature decreased. The usage of synonymous codons in GC-rich genes was also found to augment <b>bendability</b> and ability to B±Z transition and to reduce thermostability of DNA (as compared to synonymous codons with the same GC content). The analysis of transposable elements (Alu and B 2 repeats in the human and mouse) showed that the level of their divergence from the consensus sequence positively correlated with rela-tive <b>bendability</b> and ability to B±Z transition and negatively with relative thermostability. The bend-ability and ability to B±Z transition are known to relate to open chromatin and active transcription, whereas curvature facilitates chromatin condensa-tion. Because heavy isochores are known to be gene-rich and show a high level of transcription, it is suggested here that isochores arose not as an adaptation to elevated temperature but because of a certain grade of general organization and corres-pondingly advanced level of genomic organization, re¯ected in genome structuring, with physical properties of DNA in the gene-rich regions being optimized for active transcription and in the gene-poor regions for chromatin condensation (`transcription/grade ' concept) ...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the <b>bendability</b> of metallic sheets by using the finite element method. In this aim, two variants of an advanced Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman model [1, 2] are implemented in the home made FE code LAGAMINE [3, 4] and coupled with the Thomason model to predict the coalescence of voids. This advanced model is an extension of the original one to take into account of the plastic anisotropy and the mixed (isotropic + kinematic) hardening of the matrix. The difference between the two variants is related to the modeling of the damage evolution.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{contribution}} bending tests are modeled and the <b>bendability</b> of steel sheets is evaluated. <b>Bendability</b> {{refers to the}} ratio of the minimum bend radius to the initial sheet thickness at which the bending proc-ess is successfully accomplished [1]. The metallurgic microstructure of the studied sheet consists in two principal phases: a fully dense matrix (which may be itself composed by several metallurgic phases) and spherical voids. For that purpose, the Gurson Tvergaard Needleman law ([2], [3], [4]) is used and significantly modified. The behavior of the fully dense matrix is de-fined by the anisotropic Hill 48 function and the Swift hardening law. The width of the sheet is assumed to be large enough to neglect the transversal strains and the stress component in the thickness direction is also neglected. The bending operation can thus be modelled by a plane strain-plane stress loading. The influence of mechanical pa-rameters such as the initial porosity, the Lankford coefficient and the strain harden-ing exponent on the <b>bendability</b> is studied herein. The failure here is defined by the onset coalescence of neighbour voids and is checked by using Thomason [5], Pardoen [6] and Brunet [7] coalescence models.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} interest to utilize ultra-high strength steels (UHSS) in various industries such as transportation, due to the possibility to produce structures with lighter weight without the need to make amends for performance level. Yet, a major challenge concerning the application of UHSS is their formability. Factors affecting <b>bendability</b> has been widely studied, yet there exists a lack of information concerning a fundamental comprehension of the effect of microstructure on <b>bendability</b> of UHSS. The aim of this work was to study the microstructural factors governing <b>bendability</b> of UHSS. In particularly the effects of surface hardness and homogeneity of surface microstructure, i. e. deviation of hardness, were studied. The materials used in this work were direct quenched 8 - 12 mm thick UHSS microalloyed with niobium and comprising various carbon (C) and manganese (Mn) contents, rolled to different temperatures. In present work microstructural examination was performed by applying FESEM. The effects of finish rolling temperature (FRT), and C and Mn contents on the developing microstructure were studied. Bending tests were carried out for determining minimum bending radius and for comprehending failure in bending. Microhardness measurements were performed in order to comprehend the effects of hardness and homogeneity on <b>bendability,</b> and to relate microstructure with hardness. The microstructures of the materials comprise principally a mixture of lath-like bainite and martensite, and a surface layer of granular bainite and/or ferrite reaching to various depths. It is found that microstructure is highly dependent on FRT, and C and Mn concentrations. The results suggest that strain localization, i. e. development of shear bands, is precursor for damage in bending in case of complex phase UHSS. Shear bands are observed to develop at the depth range of 0. 1 - 0. 5 mm from upper surface at maximum 45 ° shear stress directions. Hence it is suggested that the properties of the upper surface layers govern <b>bendability.</b> It is found that hardness of surface determines <b>bendability</b> due to its relation with several properties, which govern the onset of diffuse necking and strain localization. The soft layer is required to reach to 2. 3 - 4. 4 % relative to the total sheet thickness, and requirements concerning its hardness level are determined by the desired bending radius. The soft layer is achieved by low FRT and by adjusting the carbon and manganese concentrations. Furthermore it is found that a homogenous surface microstructure contributes to increased <b>bendability.</b> In an inhomogeneous microstructure resistance to dislocation movement varies locally. Therefore grains possessing softer orientations and phases possessing lower hardness levels are susceptible to strain localization...|$|E

Since tensile test is a fast, simple and cheap testing method, it would be beneficial to rework it to suit better for predicting of <b>bendability.</b> In this study, the usability of tensile test results to predict failures in bending AHS steels has been investigated. The most common failures and failure mechanisms in bending are also presented. Test materials used were 6 mm thick AHS wear-resistant, protection and structural steels with good and poor bending properties. Minimum bending radii were determined and then compared with ten-sile test results to estimate the correlation. Conventional tensile test results, fracture surfaces and necking through width and thickness were analyzed. Correlation coefficient for measured tension properties and minimum bending radius was calculated. Results showed that in tensile test, have the best correlation with minimum bending radius with necking through the thickness and actual strain in necking area...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the pure bending of thin and thick {{metallic}} sheets under plane strain condition. Its main objective is to construct an efficient, robust, incremental numerical tool {{that can be used}} to simulate the bending process and predict the sheets’ <b>bendability.</b> In this investigation, the material constitutive law describing the mechanical behavior of the sheet is defined by an extended Gurson model. This model generalizes Gurson's original one to account for both plastic anisotropy and mixed (isotropic and kinematic) hardening of the matrix. In this model, only the growth phase of voids was considered (without taking into account nucleation). Here, the extended model was coupled with the kinematics of the pure bending process and with the equilibrium equations, and then implemented in an incremental numerical tool in order to predict the <b>bendability</b> of the sheets studied. This <b>bendability</b> was then verified using two different criteria. Part I of this paper focuses on the constitutive law, fulfillment of the force equilibrium, the thickness evolution and the shift of the neutral fiber, together with a comparison and discussion of the choices made by other authors regarding these parameters. The validation of the model developed in this paper will be carried out in Part II through simulations of the pure bending process. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Bendability</b> is an {{important}} material property for ultra-high strength steel. The <b>bendability</b> of a certain material is expressed as the minimum bending radius Rmin of the inner surface of the bend and expressed in multiples of the sheet thickness. <b>Bendability</b> is limited by either cracking on the surface or {{the edges of the}} bend or by surface waviness that usually precedes cracking on the outer surface. Surface waviness is a form of strain localization in bending and the intensity of the phenomenon is dependent on e. g. the punch radius, the lower tool width and the sheet thickness. In this study the <b>bendability</b> of a S 960 grade steel was investigated using optical strain measurements of three-point bending tests to determine the strain level and the bending angle when localization starts with different punch radii. The unbent samples were marked with a grid using laser marking and the deformation was measured with the GOM ARGUS strain analysis system after bending. The quality of the bend was also evaluated visually. In addition, tensile tests were performed and evaluated with the GOM ARAMIS deformation analysis system to investigate the local mechanical properties of the studied steel. The results of strain measurements and visual evaluation were then compared. It was found that beyond a certain angle the maximum strain across the bend did not significantly change with further increases in the bending angle when the punch radius was at least three times the sheet thickness. But with smaller punch radii the maximum strain increased almost linearly with increasing bending angle until fracture appeared. With the smaller punch radii deformation localizes and surface waviness begins to form in smaller bending angles because the deformation is concentrated in a narrow zone...|$|E

In other words, by {{adopting}} a buffer layer, a fragile layer such as ITO can be located at the NA position and the bending stress acting on the fragile layer can be greatly reduced, thus leading to flexible nanoelectronics with high <b>bendability.</b>|$|E

SEM/EDS analysis exhibited that Ni 2 -Si precipitates {{with a size}} of 20 ~ 100 nm were distributed in grains. Fe, Sn, Zn elemnets in Cu-Ni-Si-P alloy imporved the mechanical strength {{but it was not}} favor in increasing of electrical conductivity. As higher final rolling reduction ratio, the strength and electrical con-ductivity is increased after aging treatment, but it indicated excellent <b>bendability.</b> Especially, Cu- 2 Ni- 0. 4 Si- 0. 5 Sn- 0. 1 Fe- 0. 03 P alloy show the tensile strength value of 700 MPa and the electrical conductivity was observed t...|$|E
40|$|Promoter {{regions in}} the genomes of all domains of life show similar trends in several {{structural}} properties such as stability, <b>bendability,</b> curvature, etc. In current study we analysed the stability and <b>bendability</b> of various classes of promoter regions (based on the recent identification of different classes of transcription start sites) of Helicobacter pylori 26695 strain. It is found that primary TSS and operon-associated TSS promoters show significantly strong features in their promoter regions. DNA free-energy-based promoter prediction tool PromPredict was used to annotate promoters of different classes, and very high recall values (similar to 80 %) are obtained for primary TSS. Orthologous genes from other strains of H. pylori show conservation of structural properties in promoter regions as well as coding regions. PromPredict annotates promoters of orthologous genes with very high recall and precision...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{evaluated}} {{experimental research}} {{on the influence of}} selected factors (species, thickness, density, number of stress cycles) on the specified material characteristics (modulus of elasticity, modulus of rupture, limit of proportionality, <b>bendability</b> coefficient). The measured values were statistically evaluated and expressed in tables and graphs. Beech (Fagus Sylvatica L.) was selected to represent hardwood and aspen (Populus Tremula L.) softwood. Tree species affects all observed characteristics. The results show that the modulus of elasticity increases with increasing densification of the material, but decreases with the increasing thickness of the material. A similar dependence is observed even with the modulus of rupture and limit of proportionality, which is also dependent on the number of cycles. The <b>bendability</b> coefficient is affected by material thickness. It is expected that based on the evaluation of the results {{it will be possible to}} design materials with tailored properties...|$|E
