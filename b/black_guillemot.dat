25|$|The {{bird fauna}} of the Faroe Islands is {{dominated}} by seabirds and birds attracted to open land like heather, probably {{because of the lack}} of woodland and other suitable habitats. Many species have developed special Faroese sub-species: common eider, Common starling, Eurasian wren, common murre, and <b>black</b> <b>guillemot.</b> The pied raven was endemic to the Faroe Islands, but has now become extinct.|$|E

25|$|Kjell was {{the last}} of 27 small, cigar shaped pre-First World War torpedo boats built for the Royal Norwegian Navy. The other ships in her post-1905 series were the 1906 Teist (<b>black</b> <b>guillemot)</b> and the 1907 Skarv (cormorant). The series' main {{armament}} consisted of two deck-mounted torpedo launchers and one fixed torpedo tube in the bow. While Teist and Skarv were both armed with two 47mm guns, Kjell was equipped with a single 76mm main gun. Unlike all the preceding Norwegian torpedo boats the Officers' Mess on board Kjell was located in the bow section, with easy access to the command position in the tower.|$|E

500|$|Seabird {{migration}} {{is similar in}} pattern {{to those of the}} waders and waterfowl. Some, such as the <b>black</b> <b>guillemot</b> Cepphus grylle and some gulls, are quite sedentary; others, such as most terns and auks breeding in the temperate northern hemisphere, move varying distances south in the northern winter. The Arctic tern Sterna paradisaea has the longest-distance migration of any bird, and sees more daylight than any other, moving from its Arctic breeding grounds to the Antarctic non-breeding areas. One Arctic tern, ringed (banded) as a chick on the Farne Islands off the British east coast, reached Melbourne, Australia in just three months from fledging, a sea journey of over [...] [...] Many tubenosed birds breed in the southern hemisphere and migrate north in the southern winter.|$|E
