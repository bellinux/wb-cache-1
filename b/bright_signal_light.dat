40|$|The SoloHI {{instrument}} for the ESA/NASA Solar Orbiter mission will track density {{fluctuations in the}} inner heliosphere, by observing visible sunlight scattered by electrons in the solar wind. Fluctuations are associated with dynamic events such as coronal mass ejections, {{but also with the}} “quiescent ” solar wind. SoloHI will provide the crucial link between the low corona observations from the Solar Orbiter instruments and the in-situ measurements on Solar Orbiter and the Solar Probe Plus missions. The instrument is a visible-light telescope, based on the SECCHI/Heliospheric Imager (HI) currently flying on the STEREO mission. In this concept, a series of baffles reduce the scattered light from the solar disk and reflections from the spacecraft to levels below the scene brightness, typically by a factor of 1012. The fluctuations are imposed against a much <b>brighter</b> <b>signal</b> produced by <b>light</b> scattered by dust particles (the zodiacal light/F-corona). Multiple images are obtained {{over a period of several}} minutes and are summed on-board to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and to reduce the telemetry load.

40|$|Bipolar cells (BCs) are {{critical}} relay neurons in the retina that are organized into parallel signaling pathways. The three main signaling pathways in the mammalian retina are the rod, ON cone, and OFF cone BCs. Rod BCs mediate incrementing dim <b>light</b> <b>signals</b> from rods, and ON cone and OFF cone BCs mediate incrementing and decrementing <b>brighter</b> <b>light</b> <b>signals</b> from cones, respectively. The outputs of BCs {{are shaped by}} inhibitory inputs from GABAergic and glycinergic amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer, mediated by three distinct types of inhibitory receptors: GABAA, GABAC, and glycine receptors. The three main BC pathways receive distinct forms of inhibition from these three receptors that shape their light-evoked inhibitory signals. Rod BC inhibition is dominated by slow GABAC receptor inhibition, while OFF cone BCs are dominated by glycinergic inhibition. The inhibitory inputs to BCs are also shaped by serial inhibitory connections betweenGABAergic amacrine cells that limit the spatial profile of BC inhibition. We discuss our recent studies on how inhibitory inputs to BCs are shaped by receptor expression, receptor properties, and neurotransmitter release properties and how these affect the output of BCs...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} model of light controlling {{light in a}} multi-atom cavity QED system consisting of three-level atoms confined in a cavity and interacting with a control laser from free space.

40|$|Objectives: To {{quantify}} resting myocardial {{blood flow}} (MBF) {{in the left}} ventricular (LV) wall of HCM patients and to determine the relationship to important parameters of disease: LV wall thickness, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), T 2 -signal abnormalities (dark and <b>bright</b> <b>signal),</b> LV outflow tract obstruction and age. Materials and Methods: Seventy patients with proven HCM underwent cardiac MRI. Absolute and relative resting MBF were calculated from cardiac perfusion MRI by using the Fermi function model. The relationship between relative MBF and LV wall thickness, T 2 -signal abnormalities (T 2 dark and T 2 <b>bright</b> <b>signal),</b> LGE, age and LV outflow gradient as determined by echocardiography was determined using simple and multiple linear regression analysis. Categories of reduced and elevated perfusion in relation to non- or mildly affected reference segments were defined, and T 2 -signal characteristics and extent as well as pattern of LGE were examined. Statistical testing included linear and logistic regression analysis, unpaired t-test, odds ratios, and Fisher’s exact test. Results: 804 segments in 70 patients {{were included in the}} analysis.

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{is one of}} {{the worst}} problems in many countries. Traffic congestion wastes a huge portion of the national income for fuel and traffic-related environmental and socioeconomic problems. Computer simulation is a powerful tool for analyzing complex and dynamic scenarios. It provides an appealing approach to analyze repetitive processes. Simulation helps decision makers identify different possible options by analyzing enormous amounts of data. Hence, computer simulation can be used effectively to analyze traffic flow patterns and <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing. This paper discusses a special-purpose simulation (SPS) tool for optimize traffic <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing. The simulation model is capable of optimizing <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing at a single junction as well as an actual road network with multiple junctions. It also provides <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing for certain time periods according to traffic demand.

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} whether a strong decrease in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) within epidermoid cysts (ECs) is actually responsible for their <b>bright</b> <b>signal</b> intensity on diffusion-weighted (DW) trace images. We studied six patients with surgically proven ECs in whom ADC calculation from T 2 -weighted DW-EPI-SE data were performed within the ECs and within the deep white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as references. All ECs displayed highest signal intensity on the DW trace images. ADC values ranged from 1, 280 to 807 x 10 (- 6) mm(2) /s within cysts (with a mean value of 1, 070), from 849 to 698 x 10 (- 6) mm(2) /s within white matter (with a mean value of 764) and from 3, 370 to 2, 980 x 10 (- 6) mm(2) /s within CSF (with a mean value of 3, 185). ECs exhibited slightly higher ADC values than white matter, and not the strongly decreased ones which would have been expected if diffusion-weighting were the prominent mechanism for <b>bright</b> <b>signal</b> intensity of the ECs on DW images. However, the EC ADC values are much lower than those of the CSF. Other mechanisms must therefore be involved, i. e. the T 2 shine-through effect. Reduced ADC is not the only explanation of the EC <b>bright</b> <b>signal</b> intensity on the DW trace images...|$|R
