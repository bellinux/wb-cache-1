Colbert staunchly refused to confirm or deny his candidacy, stating {{he had not yet}} made up his mind and must first talk the possibility over with his family.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell has {{presented}} four {{series of the}} online video show David Mitchell's Soapbox, a series of short monologues co-written with John Finnemore for ChannelFlip. In these monologues Mitchell has criticised a variety of subjects, including the BBC show Doctor Who and 3D television. Matt Warman of the Daily Telegraph suggested that the series could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> new comedy will increasingly become available online, rather than on television. The series has been released on DVD.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{noticed that}} Bartram's notes were {{considerably}} altered and expanded in the printed edition, and the {{detail of the}} white tail appeared in print {{for the first time}} in this revised account. Harper believed that Bartram could have tried to fill in details of the bird from memory and got the tail coloration wrong. Harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of a king vulture relative in Florida at this late date, suggesting that the population was in the process of extinction and finally disappeared during a cold spell. Additionally, William McAtee, noting the tendency of birds to form Floridian subspecies, suggested that the white tail could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the painted vulture was a subspecies of the king vulture.|$|E

25|$|During Teti's reign, high {{officials}} {{were beginning to}} build funerary monuments that rivaled that of the Pharaoh. His vizier, Mereruka, built a mastaba tomb at Saqqara which consisted of 33 richly carved rooms, the biggest known tomb for an Egyptian nobleman. This is considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> Egypt's wealth was being transferred from the central court to the officials, a slow process that culminated in the end to the Old Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|To win dive meets, divers {{create a}} dive list {{in advance of}} the meet. To win the meet the diver must {{accumulate}} more points than other divers. Often, simple dives with low DDs will look good to spectators but will not win meets. The competitive diver will attempt the highest DD dives possible with which they can achieve consistent, high scores. If divers are scoring 8 or 9 on most dives, it may be a sign of their extreme skill, or it may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> their dive list is not competitive, and they may lose the meet to a diver with higher DDs and lower scores.|$|E
25|$|In 1644, Menasseh met Antonio de Montezinos, a Portuguese {{traveler}} and Marrano Sephardic Jew who {{had been}} in the New World. Montezinos convinced him of his conclusion that the South America Andes' Indians were the descendants of the lost ten tribes of Israel. This purported discovery gave a new impulse to Menasseh's Messianic hopes, as the settlement of Jews throughout the world was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the Messiah would come. Filled with this idea, he turned his attention to England, whence the Jews had been expelled since 1290. He worked to get them permission to settle there again and thus hasten the Messiah's coming.|$|E
25|$|Many extant lung-breathing marine {{vertebrates}} {{are capable}} of deep diving. There are some indications about the diving capacity of ichthyosaurs. Quickly ascending from a greater depth can cause decompression sickness. The resulting bone necrosis {{has been well documented}} with Jurassic and Cretaceous ichthyosaurs, where it is present in 15% and 18% of specimens respectively, but is rare in Triassic species. This could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> basal forms did not dive as deeply, but might also be explained by a greater predation pressure during the later epochs, more often necessitating a fast flight to the surface. However, this last possibility is contradicted by the fact that, with modern animals, damage is not caused by a limited number of rapid ascension incidents, but by a gradual accumulation of non-invalidating degeneration during normal diving behaviour.|$|E

25|$|While the {{rudimentary}} {{method of}} testing pH is to expose the grape juice to a pH indicator such as the strips used for a standard litmus test, the results are usually not as detailed and accurate as {{what is needed to}} evaluate ripeness. Therefore, most wineries will us a pH meter that can give readings to an accuracy of plus or minus 0.1. As with sugars and acids, the ideal pH levels to determine ripeness will vary. For white wines, winemakers often look for pH readings between 3.1 and 3.2, while would be a maximum of 3.4. If the pH is too high, it may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the grapes are overripe (or that the soil has too much potassium which will also influence pH readings). While there are risks to letting the pH go too high, winemakers can counter high pH by adding more tartaric or malic acid during the winemaking. However many viticulturists and winemakers uses pH readings as a strong boundary line for when to start the harvest.|$|E
25|$|A {{whiteboard}} grid {{is used to}} plan episodes a {{few weeks}} in advance, based on release schedules, events like E3, interviews, and other segments. They try to time reviews so they occur before or in the week the game is released, however, being a television show with a longer production period than most online content, {{this is not always}} possible. One challenge is having publishers provide games early enough to be reviewed and filmed in time. Often they receive debug code which can only be played on debug consoles, and developers are usually still working out kinks, so will provide a list of bugs for the team to take into account. Good Game also have to be wary of embargo dates as reviews can't be broadcast before then. Even if the embargo ends a few hours after a Good game episode, the review must be held back for a week. Sometimes, Good Game can only get a copy of the game after it is released, and Bajo points out that while this is sometimes due to random factors it can also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the game is bad. They try to avoid having too many of the same type of game in each week, and try to include games on all consoles. They hope that all this will ensure there is something for everyone.|$|E
500|$|Under his fictional persona in The Colbert Report, Colbert dropped {{hints of}} a {{potential}} presidential run throughout 2007, with speculation intensifying following the release of his book, I Am America (And So Can You!), which was rumored to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> he was indeed testing the waters for a future bid for the White House. On October 16, 2007, he announced his candidacy on his show, stating his intention to run both on the Republican and Democratic platforms, but only as a [...] "favorite son" [...] in his native South Carolina. He later abandoned plans to run as a Republican due to the $35,000 fee required to file for the South Carolina primary, however he continued to seek {{a place on the}} Democratic ballot and on October 28, 2007, campaigned in the South Carolina state capital of Columbia, where he was presented with the key to the city by Mayor Bob Coble.|$|E

500|$|There is {{evidence}} that Offa constructed a series of defensive burhs, or fortified towns; the locations are not generally agreed on but may include Bedford, Hereford, Northampton, Oxford and Stamford. In addition to their defensive uses, these burhs {{are thought to have}} been administrative centres, serving as regional markets and indicating a transformation of the Mercian economy away from its origins as a grouping of midland peoples. The burhs are forerunners of the defensive network successfully implemented by Alfred the Great a century later to deal with the Danish invasions. However, Offa did not necessarily understand the economic changes that came with the burhs, so it is not safe to assume he envisioned all their benefits. In 749, Ã†thelbald of Mercia had issued a charter that freed ecclesiastical lands from all obligations except the requirement to build forts and bridgesâ€“ obligations which lay upon everyone, as part of the trinoda necessitas. Offa's Kentish charters show him laying these same burdens on the recipients of his grants there, and this may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the obligations were being spread outside Mercia. These burdens were part of Offa's response to the threat of [...] "the pagan seaman".|$|E
500|$|On {{the way out}} of Hades, Euridice {{is delighted}} to be {{returning}} to earth, but Orfeo, remembering the condition related by Amore in act 1, lets go of her hand and refusing to look at her, does not explain anything to her. She does not understand his action and reproaches him, but he must suffer in silence (Duet: [...] "Vieni, appaga il tuo consorte"/"Viens, suis un Ã©poux"). Euridice takes this to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> he no longer loves her, and refuses to continue, concluding that death would be preferable. She sings of her grief at Orfeo's supposed infidelity in the aria [...] "Che fiero momento"/"Fortune ennemie" [...] (in 1774, there is a brief duet before the reprise). Unable to take any more, Orfeo turns and looks at Euridice; again, she dies. Orfeo sings of his grief in the famous aria [...] "Che farÃ² senza Euridice?"/"Jâ€™ai perdu mon Eurydice" [...] ("What shall I do without Euridice?"/"I have lost my Euridice") Orfeo decides he will kill himself to join Euridice in Hades, but Amore returns to stop him (1774 only: Trio: [...] "Tendre Amour"). In reward for Orfeo's continued love, Amore returns Euridice to life, and she and Orfeo are reunited. After a four-movement ballet, all sing in praise of Amore ("Trionfi Amore"). In the 1774 version, the chorus ("Lâ€™Amour triomphe") precedes the ballet, to which Gluck had added three extra movements.|$|E

Harris did not campaign, and collected less than $5,000 in campaign contributions. On May 2, 2006, Ney defeated him 68%â€“32%. On the day of the election, Greg Giroux of Congressional Quarterly noted: [...] "I'd be surprised if Harris got more than 20 or 25 percent. That would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> there is a chunk of the Republican base that's disenchanted with the incumbent." [...] Commenting on his situation after the primary, Ney said [...] "I have a healthy campaign account, in contrast to the Democratic Party, which is deeply divided and has a candidate with almost no campaign cash." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moreover, coastal {{countries}} {{have a vested}} interest in conserving their fish stocks which may be threatened by whales (this claim is strongly contested by the anti-whaling lobby). Japan, particularly when lobbying African nations, argues that diversification of the anti-whaling argument outside of conservation is a threat to their national interest. Exploitation of wildlife resources (such as elephant ivory, sea turtles or primates) are restricted supposedly on the ground of sustainable management. Alleged filibustering of the Revised Management Scheme and diversification of arguments outside of conservation by the anti-whaling side is alleged to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> anti-whaling countries no longer adhere to this principle (of sustainable management and exploitation of natural resources).

2500|$|The Inner Detector {{begins a}} few {{centimetres}} from the proton beam axis, extends to a radius of 1.2metres, and is 6.2 metres in length along the beam pipe. [...] Its basic {{function is to}} track charged particles by detecting their interaction with material at discrete points, revealing detailed information about the types of particles and their momentum. [...] The magnetic field surrounding the entire inner detector causes charged particles to curve; {{the direction of the}} curve reveals a particle's charge and the degree of curvature reveals its momentum. [...] The starting points of the tracks yield useful information for identifying particles; for example, if a group of tracks seem to originate from a point other than the original protonâ€“proton collision, this may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> the particles came from the decay of a hadron with a bottom quark (see b-tagging).
