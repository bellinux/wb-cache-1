40|$|We have {{identified}} cDNA clones coding {{for the major}} sulphur-rich and sulphur-poor groups of <b>barley</b> <b>storage</b> proteins (the B- and C-hordeins, respectively). Hybridization studies have revealed unexpected homologies between B- and C-hordein mRNAs. Using a deletion mutant (Risø 56), we have mapped some C-hordein-related sequences within, or closely associated with, B-hordein genes at the Hor 2 locus. Nucleotide sequencing {{has shown that the}} primary structure of B-hordein polypeptides can be divided into at least two domains: domain 1 (repetitive, proline-rich, sulphur-poor), which is homologous to C-hordein sequences, and domain 2 (non-repetitive, proline-poor, sulphur-rich), which makes up two-thirds of the polypeptide and is partially homologous to a 2 S globulin storage protein found in dicotyledons. The coding sequences that are homologous in B- and C-hordein mRNAs have an asymmetric base composition (> 80 % C-A) and are largely composed of a degenerate tandem repeat based on a 24 nucleotide consensus that encodes Pro-Gln-Gln-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gln-Gln. We discuss the evolutionary implications of the domain structure of the B-hordeins and the unusual relationship between the two groups of <b>barley</b> <b>storage</b> proteins...|$|E

The proteins were used to modify the mixing, extension and baking properties of wheat flour doughs in small-scale tests. Comparison {{of the effects of}} simple addition of the proteins versus their chemical incorporation into the glutenin macropolymer has allowed us to assess the importance of cysteine content, cysteine position and repetitive domain length in determining dough mixing and processing properties. When incorporated, the proteins, along with small synthetic oligopeptides {{based on the}}ir N- and C-terminal sequences, change the amount of large glutenin polymers, and hence dough properties, in ways consistent with their action as either chain terminators (polypeptides with single cysteine residues) or chain extenders (polypeptides with two cysteine residues, one in either terminal domain). The gross effects of chain extension and termination may be further fine-tuned by modification of the molecular size of the incorporated proteins through alteration of their repetitive domains.

40|$|Identification and {{characterization}} of different genotypes {{is essential for}} {{improving the quality of}} cultivated varieties in breeding programs. Electrophoretic separation of <b>barley</b> <b>storage</b> proteins allows us to identify and to differentiate the individual genotypes. We used acid polyacrylamid gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE) and starch gel electrophoresis (SGE) to differentiate 14 barley genotypes. Using SGE we were able to detect 29 lines while using APAGE we have detected only 22 lines. A total of 43 different alleles were deteceted and based on their combination we observed 20 hordein profiles using each method. The frequency of alleles varied from 0. 51 % to 9. 64 % for A-PAGE and from 1. 0 % to 11. 0 % for SGE. On the basis of detected alleles dendrograms were constructed using UPGMA algorithm. These dendrograms revealed genetic relations between varieties and divided collection of barley genotypes into two main groups based on A-PAGE and SGE. Both methods confirmed heterogeneity of barley varieties what allowed us to study intravarietal polymorphism...|$|E
40|$|A proteinase was {{purified}} from germinated barley (green malt from Hordeum vulgare L. cv Morex) by acidic extraction, {{ammonium sulfate}} fractionation and successive chromatographies on CM-cellulose, hemoglobin sepharose, Sephadex G- 75 and organomercurial agarose columns. The overall purification and final recovery were 290 -fold and 7. 5 %, respectively. The purified enzyme was homogeneous on analytical gel electrophoresis, yielding a single protein associated with protease activity. An apparent molecular weight of about 20 kilodaltons was estimated for the native enzyme from gel filtration. SDS-gel electrophoresis revealed a single polypeptide of about 30 kilodaltons. The optimum pH for the hydrolysis of hemoglobin was around 3. 8. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by leupeptin but was insensitive to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, indicating {{that it was}} a cysteine proteinase. It hydrolyzed several large proteins from various origins. The ability of the enzyme to digest <b>barley</b> <b>storage</b> proteins in vitro was examined using SDS-gel electrophoresis. The hydrolysis patterns obtained showed that the enzyme rapidly hydrolyzed the large hordein polypeptides into relatively small fragments. The {{results of this study suggest}} that this 30 kilodalton enzyme is one of the predominant cysteine proteinases secreted into the starchy endosperm during barley germination and that it plays a major role in the mobilization of storage proteins...|$|E
40|$|The polypeptides {{specified}} by mRNAs hybridizing to several wheat storage protein cDNAs {{were determined by}} one-and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of hybrid-selected translation products. Some of the polypeptides could be assigned to chromosomes {{on the basis of}} results gained from two-dimensional fractionation of the in vitro translation products of poly A+ RNA from nullisomic-tetrasomic lines of wheat. cDNA clones belonging to different hybridization groups contained sequences related to different gliadin polypeptide types. In order to determine the chromosomal location and copy number of homologous sequences in the wheat genome, selected cDNA clones were hybridized to restriction endonucleasedigested wheat DNA. The cDNA clones hybridized to sequences derived either from the group 1 chromosomes (γ- 3 gliadin and pTag 544 type) or from the group 6 chromosomes (α/β, pTag 53 type). The α/β type sequences are present in 25 - 35 copies per haploid genome and pTag 544 type sequences in 10 - 15 copies per haploid wheat genome. Partial sequencing of some of the cDNAs revealed low level homology between the different gliadin cross-hybridization groups, a high-molecular-weight glutenin cDNA sequence and a clone encoding the <b>barley</b> <b>storage</b> protein B-hordein.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of storage compounds {{is an important}} aspect of cereal seed metabolism. Due to the agronomical importance of the storage reserves of starch, protein, and oil, the understanding of storage metabolism is of scientific interest, with practical applications in agronomy and plant breeding. To get insight into storage patterning in developing cereal seed in response to environmental and genetic perturbation, a computational analysis of seed metabolism was performed. A metabolic network of primary metabolism in the developing endosperm of barley (Hordeum vulgare), a model plant for temperate cereals, was constructed that includes 257 biochemical and transport reactions across four different compartments. The model was subjected to flux balance analysis to study grain yield and metabolic flux distributions in response to oxygen depletion and enzyme deletion. In general, the simulation results were found to be in good agreement with the main biochemical properties of <b>barley</b> seed <b>storage</b> metabolism. The predicted growth rate and the active metabolic pathway patterns under anoxic, hypoxic, and aerobic conditions predicted by the model were in accordance with published experimental results. In addition, the model predictions gave insight into the potential role of inorganic pyrophosphate metabolism to maintain seed metabolism under oxygen deprivation...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a study on the process of moisture diffusion during <b>barley</b> grain <b>storage</b> in a grain storage silo. The moisture migration was caused by concentration gradient. The study was conducted using a model test station and consisted in the measurement of barley grain moisture and temperature in a silo, and in measuring the pressure exerted by the grain bulk on the silo wall. Analysis of the results showed that none of the parameters studied was stable. It was found that when the grain moisture content applied was 16 % in the bottom layer and 10 % in the upper layer the average value of grain moisture content in the silo increased from 13. 2 % to 14. 1 % over the ten days of the process, while with reverse positioning of the layers in the silo the corresponding increase reached 13. 8 %. This was due to additional precipitation of water {{in the course of the}} process of grain respiration. Moisture diffusion caused an increase in the temperature of the grain within the silo (up to 33 Ã‚Â°C at ambient temperature of 16 Ã‚Â°C). Another important effect of the moisture diffusion was the swelling of grains, which caused an increase in the pressure of the barley grain bulk against the silo wall. The highest increase in the wall load was observed at the boundary line between layers of grain of different moisture content levels. The changes in the values of the parameters under study were described by means of regression equations...|$|R
40|$|Many plant ion {{channels}} {{have been}} identified, but {{little is known}} about how these transporters are regulated. We have investigated the regulation of a slow vacuolar (SV) ion channel in the tonoplast of <b>barley</b> aleurone <b>storage</b> protein vacuoles (SPV) using the patch-clamp technique. SPV were isolated from barley aleurone protoplasts incubated with CaCl 2 in {{the presence or absence of}} gibberellic acid (GA) or abscisic acid (ABA). A slowly activating, voltage-dependent ion channel was identified in the SPV membrane. Mean channel conductance was 26 pS when 100 mM KCl was on both sides of the membrane, and reversal potential measurements indicated that most of the current was carried by K+. Treatment of protoplasts with GA 3 increased whole-vacuole current density compared to SPV isolated from ABA- or CaCl 2 -treated cells. The opening of the SV channel was sensitive to cytosolic free Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) between 600 nM and 100 [mu]M, with higher [Ca 2 +]i resulting in a greater probability of channel opening. SV channel activity was reduced greater than 90 % by the calmodulin (CaM) inhibitors W 7 and trifluoperazine, suggesting that Ca 2 + activates endogenous CaM tightly associated with the membrane. Exogenous CaM partially reversed the inhibitory effects of W 7 on SV channel opening. CaM also sensitized the SV channel to Ca 2 +. In the presence of ~ 3. 5 [mu]M CaM, specific current increased by approximately threefold at 2. 5 [mu]M Ca 2 + and by more than 13 -fold at 10 [mu]M Ca 2 +. Since [Ca 2 +]i and the level of CaM increase in barley aleurone cells following exposure to GA, we suggest that Ca 2 + and CaM act as signal transduction elements mediating hormone-induced changes in ion channel activity...|$|R
40|$|Carboxypeptidase and {{protease}} {{activities of}} hormone-treated barley (Hordeum vulgare cv Himalaya) aleurone layers were investigated using the substrates N-carbobenzoxy-Ala-Phe and hemoglobin. A differential effect of gibberellic acid (GA 3) on these activities was observed. The carboxypeptidase activity develops in the aleurone layers during imbibition without {{the addition of}} hormone, while the release of this enzyme to the incubation medium is enhanced by GA 3. In contrast, GA 3 is required for both the production of protease activity in the aleurone layer and its secretion. The time course for development of protease activity in response to GA 3 {{is similar to that}} observed for α-amylase. Treating aleurone layers with both GA 3 and abscisic acid prevents all the GA 3 effects described above. Carboxypeptidase activity is maximal between pH 5 and 6, and is inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. We have observed three protease activities against hemoglobin which differ in charge but are all 37 kilodaltons in size on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. The activity of the proteases can be inhibited by sulfhydryl protease inhibitors, such as bromate and leupeptin, yet is enhanced by 2 -fold with 2 -mercaptoethanol. In addition, these enzymes appear to be active against the wheat and <b>barley</b> <b>storage</b> proteins, gliadin and hordein, respectively. On the basis of these characteristics and the time course of GA 3 response, it is concluded that the proteases represent the GA 3 -induced, de novo synthesized proteases that are mainly responsible for the degradation of endosperm storage proteins...|$|E
40|$|Beer is an {{extremely}} popular beverage worldwide, representing the third-most popular drink after water and tea. And barley is the major raw material used for beer production. However, various combinations of pesticides are widely used at several stages of barley culti¬vation and during post-harvest storage to control pest and fungal disease. Hence, traces of these pesticides might remain in the beer produced from the treated ingredients. Hence, monitoring trace levels of pesticide residues during beer brewing and investigated the effects of pesticide residue {{on the quality of}} beer is essential. First, the behavior and fate of 3 pesticides (triadimefon, malathion, and dichlorvos) and the main metabolites (triadimenol and malaoxon) during <b>barley</b> <b>storage</b> or beer processing were assessed using a pilot-plant equipment. The residues of all products were determined using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Field investigation of the dissipation rate kinetics for triadimefon and malathion during storage indicated that their half-life was twice as high when 5 times the recommended dosage was used. Milling had little effect on removing dichlorvos and malathion residues, whereas they were substantially removed when the spent grains were mashed. The calculated processing factors after processing were all < 1, indicating that the residual ratios of dichlorvos and malathion were reduced during the entire process. In conclusion, storage and processing extensively reduced pesticide residue levels in barley and beer; however, greater focus needs to be paid to the toxicity of their metabolites in commercial by-products. Then we selected the triadimefon as the target fungicide to further study its behavior, the dissipation kinetics of TF during fermentation mediated by two different yeast strains, Saccharomyces cerevisiae IAPPST 1401 (Y 1) and CICC 1202 (Y 2), and found that Y 2 promoted the degradation of TF. Response surface methodology was used to optimize fermentation process variables, in order to achieve the maximum removal rate of TF and the minimum production of its corresponding metabolite, triadimenol (TN). Triadimefon is also a widely used triazole fungicide with one chiral carbon center, Stereoselective degradation of triadimefon was found during <b>barley</b> <b>storage,</b> the half-life of S-(+) -triadimefon was 36. 5 d, 31. 5 d and 30. 1 d, while R-(-) -traidmefon was 69. 3 d, 53. 3 d and 33 d under 4 °C, 25 °C and 40 °C, respectively. During brewing process, both enantiomers of triadimefon were easily degraded. After fermentation, little triadimefon detected in the beer, while RS-(+) and SS-(-) -triadimenol were detectable. This research provides accurate information for evaluating the risk of food safety. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of triadimefon affect the quality and flavor of the fermented beer, The effect of triadimefon on yeast growth and the sensory quality of beer were studied. There were significant differences in sensory quality between beer samples fermented with and without triadimefon based on data obtained with an electronic tongue and nose. Such an effect was most likely underlain by changes in yeast fermentation activity, including decreased utilization of maltotriose and most amino acids, reduced production of isobutyl and isoamyl alcohols, and increased ethyl acetate content in the fungicide treated samples. Furthermore, yeast metabolic profiling by phenotype microarray and UPLC/TOF-MS showed that triadimefon caused significant changes in the metabolism of glutathione, phenylalanine and sphingolipids, and in sterol biosynthesis. Thus, triadimefon negatively affects beer sensory qualities by influencing the metabolic activity of S. cerevisiae during fermentation, emphasizing the necessity of stricter control over fungicide residues in brewing by the food industry...|$|E

Pigs were fed isoenergetic barley-soybean meal diets and vitamin E was rationed {{on the top of}} feed, a 2 -d dose at a time. Stored and freshly harvested barley contained 33. 5 and 31. 2 mg/kg of vitamin E in the beginning and 33. 0 and 38. 7 mg/kg {{at the end of the}} study, respectively. Supplemental vitamin E had a quadratic effect on pig growth (P < 0. 05), the greatest weight gains being observed with 40 mg/kg of supplemental vitamin E in both barley diets. Vitamin E supplementation increased linearly serum (P < 0. 001) and quadratically back fat a-tocopherol (P < 0. 01). Plasma gluthathione peroxidase activity increased as pigs grew older (P < 0. 001), and at slaughter it decreased linearly with supplemental vitamin E (P < 0. 05). Dietary vitamin E supplementation did not affect the content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) or the organoleptic quality of pork stored frozen (- 18 °C) for 16 weeks. The TBARS content of pork increased with time (0 to 8 d) thawed meat was displayed under fluorescent light at 8 °C (P < 0. 001) which was detected as a poorer taste. In conclusion, supplemental dietary vitamin E above 40 mg/kg feed does not improve pig performance nor the storage stability or eating quality of frozen pork when freshly harvested or stored barley from good harvest conditions is fed to growing-finishing pigs. ...|$|E

40|$|Barley grain {{carries a}} numerous, variable, and complex {{microbial}} population that mainly consists of bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi {{and that can}} partly be detected and quantified using plating methods and microscopic and molecular techniques. The extent and the activity of this microflora {{are determined by the}} altering state of the grain and the environmental conditions in the malt production chain. Three ecological systems can be distinguished: the growing cereal in the field, the dry <b>barley</b> grain under <b>storage,</b> and the germinating barley kernel during actual malting. Microorganisms interact with the malting process both by their presence and by their metabolic activity. In this respect, interference with the oxygen uptake by the barley grain and secretion of enzymes, hormones, toxins, and acids that may affect the plant physiological processes have been studied. As a result of the interaction, microorganisms can cause important losses and influence malt quality as measured by brewhouse performance and beer quality. Of particular concern is the occurrence of mycotoxins that may affect the safety of malt. The development of the microflora during malt production can to a certain extent be controlled by the selection of appropriate process conditions. Physical and chemical treatments to inactivate the microbial population on the barley grain are suggested. Recent developments, however, aim to control the microbial activity during malt production by promoting the growth of desirable microbial cultures, selected either as biocontrol agents inhibiting mycotoxin-producing molds or as starter cultures actively contributing to malt modification.

40|$|The {{properties}} {{of a white}} wheat bread could be changed by adding normal or heat-treated barley flour in small amounts (2 and 4 %) to a white wheat bread recipe. Differences regarding gelatinisation as well as retrogradation properties were found when analysing the two flours in model systems. The heat-treated flour was fully gelatinised due to a prior time-, temperature- and pressure-treatment and could therefore absorb larger amounts of water than the other flours. In gelatinised model systems with 40 % flour (dry weight basis), the heat-treated barley flour was found to contain less retrograded amylopectin as compared to normal <b>barley</b> flour after <b>storage</b> for up to 14 days, whereas {{no differences were found}} at 20 %. However, stored breads showed an increased retrogradation of amylopectin (as measured by differential scanning calorimetry, DSC) when 2 % pre-treated barley flour was added as compared to an addition of 2 % normal barley flour. On the other hand, {{there were no significant differences}} at the 4 % level. Addition of either of the barley flours resulted in less firm breads during storage as compared to the control breads. An increased water absorption in barley flour and thereby an increased water content in the breads and/or different water binding capacities of the flour blends could explain these results. The present study indicated that water had a stronger influence on the bread firmness than the retrogradation of amylopectin. This conclusion was based on breads with pre-treated barley flour being less firm than breads with normal barley flour, although the retrogradation, as determined by DSC, was higher...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cereal storage {{proteins}} represent one of {{the most}} important sources of protein for food and feed and they are coded by multigene families. The expression of the storage protein genes exhibits a temporal fluctuation but also a response to environmental stimuli. Analysis of temporal gene expression combined with genetic variation in large multigene families with high homology among the alleles is very challenging. Results We designed a rapid qRT-PCR system with the aim of characterising the variation in the expression of hordein genes families. All the known D-, C-, B-, and γ-hordein sequences coding full length open reading frames were collected from commonly available databases. Phylogenetic analysis was performed and the members of the different hordein families were classified into subfamilies. Primer sets were designed to discriminate the gene expression level of whole families, subfamilies or individual members. The specificity of the primer sets was validated before successfully applying them to a cDNA population derived from developing grains of field grown Hordeum vulgare cv. Barke. The results quantify the number of moles of transcript contributed to a particular gene family and its subgroups. More over the results indicate the genotypic specific gene expression. Conclusions Quantitative RT-PCR with SYBR Green labelling can be a useful technique to follow gene expression levels of large gene families with highly homologues members. We showed variation in the temporal expression of genes coding for <b>barley</b> <b>storage</b> proteins. The results imply that our rapid qRT-PCR system was sensitive enough to identify the presence of alleles and their expression profiles. It can be used to check the temporal fluctuations in hordein expressions or to find differences in their response to environmental stimuli.

40|$|Abstract Background Association mapping is {{receiving}} considerable attention in plant genetics for {{its potential to}} fine map quantitative trait loci (QTL), validate candidate genes, and identify alleles of interest. In the present study association mapping in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is investigated by associating DNA polymorphisms with variation in grain quality traits, plant height, and flowering time to gain further understanding of gene functions involved in the control of these traits. We focused on the four loci BLZ 1, BLZ 2, BPBF and HvGAMYB that {{play a role in}} the regulation of B-hordein expression, the major fraction of the <b>barley</b> <b>storage</b> protein. The association was tested in a collection of 224 spring barley accessions using a two-stage mixed model approach. Results Within the sequenced fragments of four candidate genes we observed different levels of nucleotide diversity. The effect of selection on the candidate genes was tested by Tajima's D which revealed significant values for BLZ 1, BLZ 2, and BPBF in the subset of two-rowed barleys. Pair-wise LD estimates between the detected SNPs within each candidate gene revealed different intra-genic linkage patterns. On the basis of a more extensive examination of genomic regions surrounding the four candidate genes we found a sharp decrease of LD (r 2 Significant marker-trait associations between SNP sites within BLZ 1 and flowering time, BPBF and crude protein content and BPBF and starch content were detected. Most haplotypes occurred at frequencies BPBF was associated to crude protein content and starch content, BLZ 2 showed association to thousand-grain weight and BLZ 1 was found to be associated with flowering time and plant height. Conclusions Differences in nucleotide diversity and LD pattern within the candidate genes BLZ 1, BLZ 2, BPBF, and HvGAMYB reflect the impact of selection on the nucleotide sequence of the four candidate loci. Despite significant associations, the analysed candidate genes only explained a minor part of the total genetic variation although they are known to be important factors influencing the expression of seed quality traits. Therefore, we assume that grain quality as well as plant height and flowering time are influenced by many factors each contributing a small part to the expression of the phenotype. A genome-wide association analysis could provide a more comprehensive picture of loci involved in the regulation of grain quality, thousand grain weight and the other agronomic traits that were analyzed in this study. However, despite available high-throughput genotyping arrays the marker density along the barely genome is still insufficient to cover all associations in a whole genome scan. Therefore, the candidate gene-based approach will further play an important role in barley association studies. </p...|$|E

Texture was evaluated after 4 hr {{and up to}} 7 d storage at 4 ?C. Substitution of 2. 5 - 10 % barley flour significantly improved tortilla texture. Combined effects of barley flour (0 - 2. 5 %), maltogenic amylase (0 - 1650 MAU) and carboxymethylcellulose (0 - 0. 5 %) were evaluated using surface response methodology. Barley flour increased rollability, pliability, energy dissipated and reduced rupture force and final stiffness. Overall, maltogenic amylase decreased rupture force and Young's modulus but decreased rupture distance, rollability and pliability at levels above 825 MAU. CMC improved rollability, pliability, and rupture distance. The best response was found using barley flour and CMC with 825 MAU, where rollability, pliability, rupture distance and energy dissipated increased while rupture force, Young's modulus and final stiffness decreased. A 70 % barley b-glucan concentrate combined with amylase (550 MAU) or CMC (0 - 0. 5 %) was evaluated in corn tortillas. Amylase combined with b-glucan did not improve texture. Tortillas with b-glucan and CMC had significantly improved pliability, rollability, final stiffness and energy dissipated. Texture measurements analysis showed that depending {{on the stage of}} storage, objective and subjective methods correlate differently. Subjective and objective measurements of texture were not correlated at 4 hr storage. At the end of storage, pliability had significant correlations with stress relaxation measurements, but rollability had higher correlation coefficients with extensibility measurements. Pliability had higher R 2 and lower coefficients of variation compared to rollability. Sensory evaluation was conducted using reheated 14 -day-old tortillas of control, 825 MAU with 0. 25 % CMC, 0. 12 % b-glucans, 0. 18 % b-glucan with 0. 375 % CMC, and 0. 24 % b-glucan with 0. 25 % CMC. All tortillas had similar appearance, flexibility, gumminess, flavor and overall quality. Softness and chewiness of treatments with 0. 12 % b-glucan or 0. 24 % b-glucan with 0. 25 % CMC were similar to control.

40|$|The work {{presented}} here explores {{the effect of}} storage on chemical and other characteristics of dry, free of added chemicals and pest-free barley and canola grain. This was achieved by measuring the changes {{in a number of}} variables of grain stored at different temperatures under laboratory conditions and in commercial storage. The following measurements were carried out: Viability, moisture contents (mc), oil contents (oc), whole grain colour, spectrophotometry of grain extracts, hydroxy methyl furaldehyde (HMF), changes in storage atmospheres, organic sulphide levels, tocol concentrations (vitamin E), Iodine Value (IV), Thiocyanogen Value (TV), Peroxide Value (PV), p-Anisidine Value (p-AV) and Acid Value (AV). The mc of canola and barley were within the range considered safe for storage. Oil content of canola did not change significantly with storage. Viability of canola stored at 4 and 25 C did not change noticeably, but higher storage temperatures resulted in seed death. Barley maintained high viabilities at low temperatures, but was more susceptible to high temperatures than canola. Colour changes of whole <b>barley</b> grain in <b>storage</b> were pronounced and temperature dependent. Colorimetry of whole barley grain showed potential as a tool for monitoring quality changes in storage. Absorption spectra of grain extracts reflected chemical and physiological changes in storage. HMF, an indicator of Maillard browning, accumulated in short to medium term storage at 45 C and in long term storage at 25 and 35 C. Measurement of HMF was considered useful for monitoring quality changes of stored cereal grain. In a study of storage atmospheres, changes in the concentrations of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxygen, carbon disulphide and carbonyl sulphide were shown to be useful indicators of quality loss of grain in storage. Gas concentrations usually depended on storage temperature and time and reflected the storage history of the commodity. They indicated loss of carbohydrates and lipids by respiration, oxidative damage and deterioration of sulphur containing amino acids and other compounds. Oil quality indicators were consistent with oxidative damage to canola lipids in storage. IV, TV, and p-AV of canola oil did not correlate with quality of commercial samples. However, a relationship between increases in PV and high storage temperatures in canola was shown and AV increased in storage dependent on storage temperature and time. In barley and canola, the concentration of anti-oxidant tocol species (vitamin E) decreased at 35 and 45 C storage dependent on storage time. The overall tocol content as well as vitamin E activity decreased with storage decreasing the nutritional value of the commodities and indicating oxidative damage to lipids. It was concluded that the storage of dry, pest-free whole barley and canola grain at moderate temperatures (25 - 45 C) resulted in chemical and other changes. The consequence of these changes was a measurable reduction in the freshness of grain relevant to the nutritional, food technological and commercial quality of grain...|$|R
