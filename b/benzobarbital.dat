The aim of our research was to analyze the effective-ness and safety of antiepileptic therapy in women with epilepsy during pregnancy and to analyze the pregnancies ’ outcomes. We included in our research 121 pregnancies of 101 women aged at the moment of childbearing about 26. 9 ± 4. 57 years old. Idiopathic forms of epilepsy were predo-minant among all causes— 47. 1 % (р < 0. 01). Of all cases, 65. 4 % remained seizure-free from gene-ralized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), including 69. 6 % of all idiopathic epilepsy cases and 68. 6 % among symptomatic ones. The antiepileptic drugs (AED) dosages were exceeding teratogenic level at the moment of conception in 54. 7 % of the cases. Worse control of epileptic seizures was asso-ciated with <b>Benzobarbital</b> (66. 7 %) and Lamotrigine (50. 0 %). Women with epilepsy did not re-ceive specialized neurological therapy before conception in most cases, which leaded to the usag...|$|E
