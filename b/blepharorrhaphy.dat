40|$|The  research  {{objective}} was  {{to study}} the  reparative effects of  the  collagen  type  I bio-construct loaded  with buccal epithelial cells, on the rabbit cornea after experimental keratectomy {{at various stages}} of treatment (on the 3 rd, 7 th, 14 th, 3 0 th days). Material  and methods.   The  experiments were  conducted on 20 rabbits  of  the  Chinchilla breed that  were  operated on cornea of both eyes aiming to inflict epithelial and stromal cornea defects. The collagen-based bio-construct bearing buccal epithelial cells was placed  over the cornea of the experimental eyes. The  cornea of the control  eyes was covered with smooth contact lens. After the surgery, a temporal <b>blepharorrhaphy</b> was performed and kept for 3 days. We studied macroand microscopic pattern of corneal regeneration at 3, 7, 14, and 30 days of experiment. Results. When  using the collaged-based bio-construct containing buccal epithelial cells, the complete epithelialization of the corneal defect occurred at mean 7 days earlier compared {{to that in the}} control eyes. Thus, the offered bio-construct stimulated the cell migration and proliferation at early stages of treatment (3 – 7 days) reducing the inflammation activity. Conclusion. The bio-construct comprising a collagen type  I matrix loaded with buccal epithelial cells can provide an effective treatment option for corneal defects. </p...|$|E
40|$|Long-standing {{peripheral}} monolateral {{facial paralysis}} {{in the adult}} has challenged otolaryngologists, neurologists and plastic surgeons for centuries. Notwithstanding, {{the ultimate goal of}} normality of the paralyzed hemi-face with symmetry at rest, and the achievement of a spontaneous symmetrical smile with corneal protection, has not been fully reached. At the beginning of the 20 (th) century, the main options were neural reconstructions including accessory to facial nerve transfer and hypoglossal to facial nerve crossover. In {{the first half of the}} 20 (th) century, various techniques for static correction with autologous temporalis muscle and fascia grafts were proposed as the techniques of Gillies (1934) and McLaughlin (1949). Cross-facial nerve grafts have been performed since the beginning of the 1970 s often with the attempt to transplant free-muscle to restore active movements. However, these transplants were non-vascularized, and further evaluations revealed central fibrosis and minimal return of function. A major step was taken in the second half of the 1970 s, with the introduction of microneurovascular muscle transfer in facial reanimation, which, often combined in two steps with a cross-facial nerve graft, has become the most popular option for the comprehensive treatment of long-standing facial paralysis. In the second half of the 1990 s in France, a regional muscle transfer technique with the definite advantages of being one-step, technically easier and relatively fast, namely lengthening temporalis myoplasty, acquired popularity and consensus among surgeons treating facial paralysis. A total of 111 patients with facial paralysis were treated in Caen between 1997 and 2005 by a single surgeon who developed 2 variants of the technique (V 1, V 2), each with its advantages and disadvantages, but both based on the same anatomo-functional background and aim, which is transfer of the temporalis muscle tendon on the coronoid process to the lips. For a comprehensive treatment of the paralysis, the eyelids are usually managed by Paul Tessier's technique to lengthen the levator muscle of the upper eyelid by aponeurosis interposition, combined with external <b>blepharorrhaphy</b> with Krastinova-Lolov's technique. Facial reanimation using lengthening temporalis myoplasty is a dynamic procedure that has its roots in the techniques of Gillies and McLaughlin. This method is a true lengthening myoplasty procedure using no intermediate grafts. In general, the results with a 1 -stage combination of lengthening temporalis myoplasty and static correction of the lagophthalmos appear comparable with the major series in the literature using free microneurovascular transfers combined with cross-facial nerve grafts for longstanding peripheral monolateral facial paralysis. The obvious advantages of temporalis elongation myoplasty consist in its technical ease, a single step, low incidence of complications and markedly reduced operating time...|$|E
40|$|Exophthalmos and eyelid {{retraction}} {{are typical}} symptoms of many orbital or systemic diseases, Graves' orbitopathy being the commonest. Independently from the cause, both may increase evaporation with drying of the ocular surfaces resulting in pain, tearing, and photophobia. The structural {{integrity of the}} cornea may also be damaged with possible compromise of the visual function. Acute onset of exophthalmos and/or eyelid retraction deserves maximum attention. In order to avoid corneal decompensation and waiting for a more definitive treatment, eye lubricants, moisture chambers, swimming goggles, temporary tarsorrhaphies or <b>blepharorrhaphies</b> represent the measures of choice. Exophthalmos depending on neoplastic, vascular, infectious, inflammatory or malformative causes is, {{in the majority of}} cases, amenable of medical or surgical causative treatment while, for endocrine exophthalmos the commonest treatment is surgical and symptomatic and consists of orbital bone decompressions. Eyelid retraction due to active inflammatory processes can be treated medically while for persistent eyelid retraction the treatment is surgical and based on lengthening of the anterior, and/or posterior, and/or mid-eyelid lamellae. Exophthalmos and eyelid retraction due to Graves' orbitopathy, their influence on ocular surface disorders and the treatment of these conditions will be specifically analysed in this chapte...|$|R
