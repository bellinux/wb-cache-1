5|$|A 2000 made-for-TV {{film was}} to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>about</b> the Stella Nickell case, {{but it was}} {{cancelled}} shortly before production began based on strong objections from advertisers, including Johnson & Johnson, owner of the Tylenol brand of painkillers, which had featured in the Chicago Tylenol murders, a prior product-tampering case. The film was to have aired on USA Network, directed by Jeff Reiner and starring Katey Sagal.|$|E
5|$|Carter {{was given}} Ife {{works of art}} in 1896 by the {{recently}} crowned King of Ife, Adelekan, {{in the hopes that}} a decision in his favour would <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>about</b> the resettlement of Modakeke residents outside the city. These works (including three known as the Ife marbles), were sent by Carter to Europe.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, {{the greater}} {{volume of traffic}} using the humpbacked bridge, which had poor {{visibility}} and narrow approach roads, led to a rise in accidents {{and an increase in}} bypass proposals. Many similar bridge towers were completely demolished starting as early as the 18th century due to the desire of local authorities to clear carriageways of all obstructions to improve traffic flow. The bridge and gate were formally protected as an Ancient Monument in 1923, and proposals for a new road bridge began to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>about</b> the same time. The new A40, built in 1965–6, relieved the town of much through traffic, and a town centre plan, prepared by the District Council in 1981, again proposed a new bridge. Repairs had to be undertaken in 1982 following a collision on 18 May in which a double-decker bus struck the bridge, resulting in its closure for a month. Damage to the bridge and gate through accidents continued, and in the early 1990s, two drivers were prosecuted after crossing the bridge with vehicles significantly exceeding the weight and height limits.|$|E

5|$|The Standard Model of {{particle}} physics {{is a theory}} which describes {{three of the four}} known fundamental interactions between the elementary particles that make up all matter. This theory allows predictions to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>about</b> how particles will interact under many conditions. The energy per particle in a supernova is typically one to one hundred and fifty picojoules (tens to hundreds of MeV). The per-particle energy involved in a supernova is small enough that the predictions gained from the Standard Model {{of particle}} physics are likely to be basically correct. But the high densities may require corrections to the Standard Model. In particular, Earth-based particle accelerators can produce particle interactions which are of much higher energy than are found in supernovae, but these experiments involve individual particles interacting with individual particles, and {{it is likely that the}} high densities within the supernova will produce novel effects. The interactions between neutrinos and the other particles in the supernova take place with the weak nuclear force, which is believed to be well understood. However, the interactions between the protons and neutrons involve the strong nuclear force, which is much less well understood.|$|E
5|$|The eight trains {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to arrive back in Liverpool at 4.00pm. By 7.00pm, the passenger train was not yet even halfway back to Liverpool. As darkness fell it began to rain, and the drivers, fearing {{for the safety of the}} trains in the dark and wet, slowed the train further. As it had not been intended that the inaugural journey take place in the darkness the trains were not fitted with lighting or engine lamps; the driver of Comet, leading the train, held a burning tarry rope to light the way ahead. Although some of the crowds lining the route were now dispersing, many others had remained to see the trains return. These crowds had been drinking all day; as the train passed under bridges the train, with its open carriages, was pelted with objects thrown down from the bridges, and on one occasion Comet struck a wheelbarrow, apparently deliberately placed across the rails. Passing Eccles, the train stopped briefly for enquiries to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>about</b> Huskisson; those enquiring were told that he was looking frail, and a successful operation was unlikely in his current condition.|$|E

25|$|The related terms data dredging, data fishing, {{and data}} {{snooping}} {{refer to the}} use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>about</b> the validity of any patterns discovered. These methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.|$|E
25|$|Executive Liaison Groups enable MI5 {{to safely}} share secret, sensitive, and often raw {{intelligence}} with the police, on which decisions can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>about</b> {{how best to}} gather evidence and prosecute suspects in the courts. Each organisation works in partnership throughout the investigation, but MI5 retain the lead for collecting, assessing and exploiting intelligence. The police take lead responsibility for gathering evidence, obtaining arrests and preventing risks to the public.|$|E

25|$|In {{the postwar}} period, a {{decision}} had to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>about</b> {{whether or not}} to cancel the contracts for the as-yet 64 undelivered vessels, 22 of which were already on the slipways and work on the remainder having not yet begun. Both the USSB and Harriman himself anticipated a postwar shipbuilding boom, and so the decision was taken to complete the contracts. This decision {{would turn out to be}} woefully wrong, but the error was not yet apparent.|$|E
25|$|The consul Quintus Lutatius Catulus {{was among}} {{a circle of}} poets who made short, light Hellenistic poems fashionable. One of his few {{surviving}} fragments is a poem of desire addressed to a male with a Greek name. The elevation of Greek literature and art as models of expression promoted the celebration of homoeroticism as the mark of an urbane and sophisticated person. No assumptions or generalizations should <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>about</b> any effect on sexual orientation or real-life behavior among the Romans.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to distance restraints, restraints on the torsion angles {{of the chemical}} bonds, typically the psi and phi angles, can be generated. One approach {{is to use the}} Karplus equation, to generate angle restraints from coupling constants. Another approach uses the chemical shifts to generate angle restraints. Both methods use the fact that the geometry around the alpha carbon affects the coupling constants and chemical shifts, so given the coupling constants or the chemical shifts, a qualified guess can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>about</b> the torsion angles.|$|E

25|$|Besides the {{previous}} representation results, {{there are some}} other statements that can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>about</b> complete lattices, or that take a particularly simple form in this case. An example is the Knaster–Tarski theorem, which states that the set of fixed points of a monotone function on a complete lattice is again a complete lattice. This is easily seen to be a generalization of the above observation about the images of closure operators, since these are exactly the sets of fixed points of such operators.|$|E
25|$|In many {{healthcare}} systems, prolonged ventilation as part {{of intensive}} care is a limited resource (in {{that there are only}} so many patients that can receive care at any given moment). It is used to support a single failing organ system (the lungs) and cannot reverse any underlying disease process (such as terminal cancer). For this reason, there can be (occasionally difficult) decisions to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>about</b> whether it is suitable to commence someone on mechanical ventilation. Equally many ethical issues surround the decision to discontinue mechanical ventilation.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{microarray}} {{analysis is}} currently being used in AM fungal research to simultaneously measure the expression of many genes from target species or experimental samples. The most common tool or method is to use functional gene array (FGA) technology, a specialized microarray that contains probes for genes that are functionally important in microbial processes such as carbon, nitrogen or phosphorus cycling. FGAs {{have the ability to}} simultaneously examine many functional genes. This technique is typically used for general analysis of functional microbial genes, but when complemented with genetic sequencing, inferences can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>about</b> the connection between fungal community composition and microbial functionality.|$|E

25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} theory {{can be used}} in looking at pricing decisions. Field information such as retail and wholesale prices as well as the size of the market and market share are all incorporated into the prior information. Managerial judgement is included in order to evaluate different pricing strategies. This method of evaluating possible pricing strategies does have its limitations as it requires a number of assumptions to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>about</b> the market place in which an organisation operates. As markets are dynamic environments {{it is often difficult to}} fully apply Bayesian {{decision theory}} to pricing strategies without simplifying the model.|$|E
25|$|The Local Government Finance Act 1988 gives broad {{authorisation}} for regulations to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>about</b> alterations, which can include alterations by the Valuation Office Agency {{to maintain the}} list accurately, or proposals by interested parties to change the list. The regulations have differed widely, changing the time-frame of when alterations are effective. For example, proposals to alter the 2000 rating list by an occupier were restricted to take effect in the financial year {{in which they were}} made, but the 2005 rating list removed this restriction, so that a successful proposal can have effect as far back as 1 April 2005.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{drawings}} originally used at Doncaster Works for the A1 Peppercorn class had been preserved at the NRM, {{and a team}} of volunteers spent three days collating these in the autumn of 1991. The original drawings were India ink drawings on linen; these had to be scanned into a Computer Aided Design (CAD) software program, as the microfilm NRM copies were not suitable for manufacturing purposes, and direct dyeline copies could not <b>be</b> <b>made.</b> <b>About</b> 95 percent of the original drawings were found, with 1,100 scanned by 1993, and a further 140 in 2001. A few poor-quality originals required re-drawing.|$|E
