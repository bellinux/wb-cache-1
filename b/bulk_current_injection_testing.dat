It is often desired to compare radiated emissions with radiated susceptibility performance to assess system level compatibility. For reasons purely theoretical and because of practical measurement limitations, this not realistic. McCollum and Clark proposed a limit and test method that provided a direct comparison of radiated {{emissions and}} radiated susceptibility performance in those cases where only unintentional emissions and reception are of interest (non-tunable electronics). This test method, referred to as bulk current emissions (BCE) testing, and its associated limit is a complementary test method to <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> <b>testing</b> and radiated susceptibility testing. Previous work utilized victim and culprit circuits with low common-mode loop impedance. Forward work identified in this publication was to determine how different loop impedance on culprit and victim circuits affected cable-to-cable coupling and the corresponding BCE test limit. Cable coupling factors for victim and culprit circuits with different loop impedance are investigated...|$|E

In this paper, an accurate EUT model has been designed based on impedance investigation. This model {{can be used to}} predict the conducted susceptibility of a generic EUT. The model is first based on black-box approach; then, an interaction model is added to provide flexibility of several geometric parameters, which can be changed from one setup to another. This methodology leads to the combined approach, which shows a satisfactory agreement between simulations and measurements. According to the developed equations, the impedance matrix of the described model can be readily switched to modal one. Afterward, asymmetric dummy EUTs were investigated and the analytical equations used to predict differential mode due to common-mode voltage injection were validated...|$|R

To this end, an accurate model of the injection probe is combined with typical injection profiles recommended by automotive Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Standards, and with a distributedparameter representation of the wiring harness. The model also includes possible imbalance affecting the bus terminal sections, whose non-ideal behavior is recognized {{to be at the}} basis of bus susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. As a matter of fact, the obtained predictions prove the great sensitivity of the injected current to the degree of imbalance of the terminal sections, and indicate that, in order to derive from the test consistent information to fix possible susceptibility problems, statistical models accounting for the uncertainty associated with the involved circuit components are preferable, unless accurate characterization of the terminal sections were available...|$|R

Closed-form results are obtained that enforce equivalence of the aforementioned test procedures in terms of specific statistical estimates (e. g., expected value and dispersion) {{as well as for}} worst-case radiation-induced effects. A distributed-parameter circuit model of the system under test is adopted, composed by the EUT, auxiliary equipment (AE), and a wiring harness. In the analysis, the EMD is described via plane waves with random parameters and a uniform multiconductor transmission line model is used for the wiring harness.

40|$|In this paper, {{possible}} {{applications of}} double <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> for susceptibility <b>testing</b> of spacecraft are investigated and discussed. Two test procedures are proposed: one {{is suitable for}} system-level (i. e., onboard) testing, the other for unit-level assessment of avionic equipment interconnected by multiwire shielded bundles. By enforcing equivalence between radiation and injection, both procedures are designed to inject expected electromagnetic interference (EMI) levels in the equipment under test (EUT), connected at the terminations of a wiring harness. The procedure for system-level testing requires amplitude and phase control of the radio-frequency power sources used to feed the injection probes. It allows to correlate the susceptibility effects obtained by injection with those due to a nonuniform electromagnetic field (such as the field generated by internal EMI sources in metallic enclosures). It is, therefore, suited for radiated intrasystem verifications. The procedure for unit-level testing exploits equivalence between radiation and injection {{in terms of the}} current distribution along the overshield, and applies to bundles with an arbitrary number of inner conductors. In the case of vertical polarization, this procedure allows for the reconstruction of the interference effects produced in the EUT by conventional radiated-susceptibility tests (e. g., DO- 160), requiring direct radiation of the system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{practical}} <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> based built-in <b>test</b> (BIT) technique for impedance-matched RF low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) is proposed. A current generation circuit injects the RF test current {{at the gate}} of the LNA; this approach has the advantage that the matching network is not affected by the test circuitry. The technique can be used without design changes to measure the voltage gain during on-wafer test and to measure during final test in the presence of gate inductance and package parasitics. Furthermore, the <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> <b>testing</b> technique enables accurate gain measurements in order to detect faulty impedance matching networks. The proposed current-based BIT requires an on-chip voltage source, two on-chip power detectors (PDs), and an accurate external resistor.
