This requirement was {{a reflection of the}} League's belief in the sovereignty of its component nations; the League sought solution <b>by</b> <b>consent,</b> not by dictation. In case of a dispute, the consent of the parties to the dispute was not required for unanimity.|$|E
5|$|The Confirmatio Cartarum (Confirmation of Charters) {{was issued}} in Norman French by Edward I in 1297. Edward, needing money, had taxed the nobility, {{and they had}} armed {{themselves}} against him, forcing Edward to issue his confirmation of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter to avoid civil war. The nobles had sought to add another document, the De Tallagio, to Magna Carta. Edward I's government {{was not prepared to}} concede this, they agreed to the issuing of the Confirmatio, confirming the previous charters and confirming the principle that taxation should be <b>by</b> <b>consent,</b> although the precise manner of that consent was not laid down.|$|E

25|$|The {{first law}} {{enforcement}} agency in New Zealand was established in 1840, modelled on similar constabularies that existed in Britain at that time. It was initially part police and part militia. By {{the end of the}} 19th century policing <b>by</b> <b>consent</b> was the goal. The New Zealand Police has generally enjoyed a reputation for mild policing, however there have been significant cases when the use of force was criticised, such as during the 1981 Springbok tour.|$|E

25|$|Stephen Gwynn {{formed the}} Irish Centre Party in 1919 and stood unsuccessfully as an Independent Nationalist for Dublin University in the December general elections. The party merged with Plunkett's Irish Dominion League {{to press for}} a {{settlement}} <b>by</b> <b>consent</b> {{on the basis of}} dominion status, but Gwynn subsequently broke with Plunkett due to his willingness to accept partition as a temporary compromise. The polarities which divided Ireland during the Anglo-Irish War and Irish Civil War increasingly sidelined Gwynn's brand of moderate cultural nationalism. Although he supported the newly emergent nation he equally condemned some of the excesses, such as the burning of houses belonging to Free State senators.|$|E
25|$|The {{declared}} {{value of the}} bulk of goods from the carrack brought back <b>by</b> <b>Consent</b> and Salomon was £31,000 and the cargo of Virgin {{and two of the}} fluitships were assessed at £15,000. Pereguine, Welcome their prize and the other fluitship carried at least as much totaling over £51,000. As well as Brazil wood the carracks cargo consisted of pepper, cloves, indigo, cinnamon, mace, Benzoin resin, frankincense, gum-lac, aloes, calicoes, silks and rutile quartz blonde stones. In all the total would have represented £6,100 for the Lord Admiral and £3,050 for the Queen. Also of importance were new Portuguese rutters captured at Recife; Lancaster would use them to great effect for the first ever English East India company expedition in 1601.|$|E
25|$|The treaty {{terms were}} {{ratified}} by the Dáil on 7 January 1922 by 64–57, but the minority refused to be bound by the result. The main dispute centred on the proposed status as a dominion (as represented by the Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity) for Southern Ireland, {{rather than as an}} independent all-Ireland republic, but continuing partition was a significant matter for Ulstermen like Sean MacEntee, who spoke strongly against partition or re-partition of any kind. The pro-treaty side argued that the proposed Boundary Commission would satisfy the greatest number {{on each side of the}} eventual border, and felt that the Council of Ireland (as envisaged by the 1920 Home Rule Act) would lead to unity <b>by</b> <b>consent</b> over a longer period.|$|E

25|$|Constitutionally, New South Wales {{was founded}} as an autocracy {{run by the}} Governor, {{although}} he nearly always exercised his powers within the restraints of British law. In practice the early Governors ruled <b>by</b> <b>consent,</b> with the advice of military officers, officials and leading settlers. The New South Wales Corps was formed in England in 1789 as a permanent regiment to relieve the marines who had accompanied the First Fleet. Officers of the Corps soon {{became involved in the}} corrupt and lucrative rum trade in the colony. In the Rum Rebellion of 1808, the Corps, working closely with the newly established wool trader John Macarthur, staged the only successful armed takeover of government in Australian history, deposing Governor William Bligh and instigating a brief period of military rule in the colony prior to the arrival from Britain of Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1810.|$|E
500|$|Adams first rose to {{prominence}} leading widespread {{opposition to the}} Stamp Act of 1765, imposed by the British Parliament without consulting the American legislatures, and requiring payment of a direct tax by the colonies for various stamped documents. Adams authored the [...] "Braintree Instructions" [...] in 1765, a letter sent to the representatives of Braintree in the Massachusetts legislature which served {{as a model for}} other towns' instructions. In the piece, he explained that the Stamp Act should be opposed since it denied two fundamental rights guaranteed to all Englishmen, and which all free men deserved: rights to be taxed only <b>by</b> <b>consent</b> and to be tried only by a jury of one's peers. The instructions were a succinct and forthright defense of colonial rights and liberties.|$|E
500|$|Following his arrest, {{the tribal}} {{court of the}} Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe charged Lara with assaulting the arresting officers, along with four other charges. Lara pleaded guilty to the tribal charge of [...] "violence to a policeman". Soon after, federal {{prosecutors}} charged Lara with assault on a federal officer and {{a federal grand jury}} indicted him. Lara moved to dismiss the charge based on double jeopardy and other constitutional grounds. The Federal District Court, with Magistrate Judge Alice R. Senechal sitting <b>by</b> <b>consent,</b> denied the motions and Lara entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal. Senechal noted that two other trial courts in the circuit had already ruled that double jeopardy did not apply, that the ICRA only recognized the inherent sovereignty of the tribes and did not delegate prosecutorial power to the tribe. She further noted that another circuit court had ruled the same way. Lara also argued that the Petite doctrine, if applied, would preclude his prosecution, and that since it was never applied to federal prosecutions following convictions in tribal court, it discriminated against Indians. Senechal denied this motion, noting that Lara had shown no examples of other races not being prosecuted for like offenses.|$|E
