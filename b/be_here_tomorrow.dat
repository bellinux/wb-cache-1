6000|$|... "I am. Oh, I am!" [...] said Miss Trevor eagerly. [...] "I {{really would}} have known if I had stopped to think. Well, it's getting late now. I must go back, {{although}} I don't want to. But I'm coming to see you again. Will you <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>tomorrow</b> afternoon?" ...|$|E

50|$|Home-keeping {{dogs have}} homely wits,Their notions tame and poor;I scorn the dog who humbly sitsBefore the cottage door,Or those who weary vigils keep,Or follow lovely kine;A dreary life midst stupid sheepShall ne'er be lot of mine.For free from thrall I travel far, No fixed abode I own;I leap aboard a railway car; By every one I' know;Today I <b>am</b> <b>here,</b> <b>tomorrow</b> brings Me {{miles and miles}} away; Borne swiftly on steams rushing wings, I see fresh friends each day.Each Driver from the {{footplate}} halesMy coming with delight; I gain from all upon the rails; A welcome ever bright;I share the perils of the linewith mates from end to end,Who would not for a silver mineHave harm befall their friendLet other dogs snarl and fight,And round the city prowl,Or render hideous the nightWith unmelodious howl.I have a cheery bark for all,No ties my travels clog;I hear the whistle, that's the callFor Bob, the driver's dog.|$|R

5000|$|It {{had been}} {{arranged}} that Jenkins was to preach on the Monday night before {{his return to}} New Quay. The Church was again full with people professing their faith in Jesus; {{but perhaps the most}} dramatic turn was when one of the crowd announced, [...] "Another meeting like this will <b>be</b> held <b>here</b> <b>tomorrow</b> night…"; that meeting was again well attended and went on until {{the early hours of the}} morning. Despite already having been ordained as a Minister, on that weekend in November 1904 Williams had a conversion experience, on the Saturday night prior to Jenkins' arrival.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, lad, I {{think we}} can {{consider}} that as all settled, and I won't come near you again, unless there is some change of plan.

I'm late now, and schools have a dreadful habit of going in sharp on time. If you should happen to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> I'm going to stop and ask your name." ...|$|E

Schuyler will <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>tomorrow</b> {{with the rest}} of the army, and we are to move down to Isle-aux-Noix, at the end of the lake, and I suppose we shall land at once and march against St. John's.

5000|$|Kohnová {{was born}} in Plzeň in 1929, into the family of Otakar Kohn, a {{secretary}} for the Teller company. At {{the age of twelve}} she began keeping a diary. She wrote in it for five months, during which time the situation of her family and other Jews in Plzeň gradually worsened. She didn't describe the fate of Jews of the time but wrote mainly about her personal feelings. The last entry in her diary is, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>here</b> just <b>tomorrow</b> and after tomorrow, who knows what will be then. Bye-bye, my diary!".|$|R
5000|$|J: Wild pitch. Here's {{the pitch}} to Mookie Wilson. Winning run at second. Ground ball to first, it is a run...an error! An error by Buckner! The winning run scores! The Mets win it 6 to 5 with {{three in the}} tenth! The ball went right through the legs of Buckner and the Mets with two men out and nobody on have scored three times {{to bring about a}} seventh game, which will <b>be</b> played <b>here</b> <b>tomorrow</b> night. Folks, it was unbelievable. An error, right through the legs of Buckner. There were two on, nobody out, a single by Carter, a single by Mitchell, a single by Ray Knight, a wild pitch, an error by Buckner. Three in the ninth for the Mets. They've won the game 6-5 and we shall play <b>here...</b> <b>tomorrow</b> night! Well, open up the history book, folks, we've got an entry for you...What do you think, Sparky? ...|$|R
5000|$|It was hinted in Morrison's {{run that}} Cassandra Nova {{took on the}} form of Ernst once she was placed inside the body of Stuff {{as part of her}} reprogramming. The final hint <b>was</b> in <b>Here</b> Comes <b>Tomorrow</b> (New X-Men #153), where she tells Martha Johansson, whom Ernst was always seen around, that [...] "of course you can still call me Ernst." ...|$|R

Then, when I have talked matters over with them, I shall ride to Roxburgh and lay the matter before the governor. I know that I shall get no help from him; but at least, when he hears of a {{gathering}} here, he will know that 'tis with no evil intention against the English." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{will be easy}} enough," [...] Nessus replied. [...] "My {{friends have}} many {{relations}} in the Arab quarter, and once free, you might be concealed there for any time. And now I will wait no longer, for last night visits were made in all the barracks and stables by the agents of the law, to see that every man was asleep in his place. Therefore I will return without delay. In two days I will be here again; but should anything occur which it is needful to tell you I will <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>tomorrow</b> night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{expected}} you back," [...] that gentleman said, as he entered. [...] "Bad news travels apace, and, an hour since, a man {{brought in}} the news that Sir Marmaduke had been seen riding, evidently a prisoner, surrounded by soldiers, on the road towards Lancaster. So that villain we chased last night must have learnt something. I suppose they will <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> but I do not see what serious charge they can have against us. We have neither collected arms, nor taken any steps towards a rising. We have talked over what we might do, {{if there were a}} landing made from France, but, as there may be no landing, that is a very vague charge." ...|$|E

5000|$|Leading {{up to the}} event, Beck {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} various media personalities, comedians and writers. MSNBC's Keith Olbermann stated that {{he was worried about}} Glenn Beck's sanity after Beck said that he wanted to let [...] "the spirit" [...] speak through him at the rally. The day before the rally on the same network, Chris Matthews, of Hardball With Chris Matthews, used his ending segment to announce: Can we imagine if King <b>were</b> physically <b>here</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> today, <b>were</b> he to reappear tomorrow on the very steps of the Lincoln Memorial? I have a nightmare that one day a right wing talk show host will come to this spot, his people's lips dripping with the words interposition and nullification.

Mr. Presty's {{wonderful}} knowledge of figures has been of the greatest use to me in later life. Thanks to his instructions, I am {{the only person in the}} house who can grapple with the intricacies of our railway system. Your poor father, Mr. Norman, could never understand time-tables and never attempted to conceal his deficiencies. He had none of the vanity (harmless vanity, perhaps) which led poor Mr. Presty to express positive opinions on matters of which he knew nothing, such as pictures and music. What do you want, Malcolm?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We sha'n't leave much behind us," [...] Dick said, as {{he looked}} round after the last {{customer}} had left, and they had sat down to their evening meal. [...] "Almost all the silver work and the better class of goods have gone, and I should say three-quarters of the rest. I daresay we shall {{get rid of the}} remainder tomorrow. I don't suppose many of the soldiers stationed down by the gate have come up yet; but when they hear that we sell cheaply, some of them will <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>tomorrow.</b> We have made no money by the transaction, but at any rate we shall have got back the outlay. Of course, I should not have cared if we had got nothing back. Still, it is satisfactory to have cleared oneself.|$|E
6000|$|... "What has happened?" [...] he {{repeated}} in reply to Malcolm's question. [...] "Well, I don't {{know much about}} it myself, but I do know that Wallenstein is dead, for the trooper who rides next to me helped to kill him. Everyone is content that the traitor has been punished, and as the troops have all pronounced for the emperor every thing is quiet. We had a good laugh this afternoon. The colonel sent out one of our men dressed up in Wallenstein's livery to meet the Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg and invite him to come on at once and join him here. The duke suspected no danger, and rode on ahead of his troops, with a few attendants, and {{you should have seen}} his face, when, after passing through the gates, he suddenly found himself surrounded by our men and a prisoner. Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar will <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> as they say, and we shall catch him in the same way. It's a rare trap this, I can tell you." ...|$|E

"Very bad, Doctor; {{they expect}} the Rajah Por Sing, who, it seems, {{is the leader of}} the party in this district, and several other Zemindars, to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> with guns <b>tomorrow</b> or next day. The news from Cawnpore was true.. The native troops mutinied and marched away, but were joined by Nana Sahib and his force, and he persuaded them to return and attack the whites in their intrenchments at Cawnpore, as they would not be well {{received}} at Delhi unless they had properly accomplished their share of the work of rooting out the Feringhees." ...|$|R

Because in the {{struggle}} which we have before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know. But I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark mystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certain point, and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September, how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought out. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he will <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>tomorrow</b> to help us.

I told her some of my adventures with you, and that, by the same token, I had a hundred gold pieces that the Baron of Pointdexter had given me, sewn up in a belt round my waist, where it has been ever since I got it, except when we went into battle, or on that expedition to Scotland, when, as your honour knows, I always put it in with the agent in your name, seeing that I would rather, if I was killed, know that your honour would have it, instead of its being taken by some villain searching the dead. I told her that, if she and Mrs. Callaghan wanted to take a bigger place, I would share it with her, and that quite settled the matter, in her mind, that I was her brother.
