5|$|Ethylene glycol {{has a low}} vapor pressure; it {{does not}} {{evaporate}} readily at normal temperatures and therefore high concentrations in air or intoxication are unlikely to occur following inhalational exposures. There may be a slight risk of poisoning where mists or fogs are generated, although this rarely leads to poisoning as ethylene glycol causes irritation and coughing when <b>breathed</b> <b>in,</b> alerting victims to its presence. Ethylene glycol is not well absorbed through skin meaning poisoning following dermal exposure is also uncommon.|$|E
5|$|NASA astronauts train {{underwater}} {{to simulate}} the weightlessness and occasionally need to fly afterwards at cabin altitudes not exceeding 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Training dives use 46% Nitrox and can exceed six hours at a maximum depth of 40ffw (12mfw) for a maximum equivalent air depth (EAD) of 24fsw (7 msw). NASA guidelines for EADs of 20–50fsw (6–15msw) with maximum dive durations of 100–400 minutes allow either air or oxygen to be <b>breathed</b> <b>in</b> the preflight surface intervals. Oxygen breathing during surface intervals reduces the time to fly {{by a factor of}} seven to nine times compared with air. A study by another military organization, the Special Operations Command also indicated that preflight oxygen might be an effective means for reducing DCS risk.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{respiratory}} tract {{is part of the}} respiratory system, and consists of the trachea and the structures below this including the lungs. The trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place where it splits (the carina) into a right and left bronchus. These supply air to the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. These in turn supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases take place. Oxygen <b>breathed</b> <b>in,</b> diffuses through the walls of the alveoli into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.|$|E

25|$|The {{rates at}} which air is <b>breathed</b> <b>in</b> or out, either through the mouth or nose, or into {{or out of}} the alveoli are {{tabulated}} below, together with how they are calculated. The number of breath cycles per minute is known as the respiratory rate.|$|E
25|$|Air passes unidirectionally {{through the}} lungs during both {{exhalation}} and inspiration, causing, {{except for the}} oxygen-poor dead space air left in the trachea after exhalation and <b>breathed</b> <b>in</b> {{at the beginning of}} inhalation, little to no mixing of new oxygen-rich air with spent oxygen-poor air (as occurs in mammalian lungs), changing only (from oxygen-rich to oxygen-poor) as it moves (unidirectionally) through the parabronchi.|$|E
25|$|Independent twin {{cylinders}}, (Two cylinders {{of about}} the same capacity mounted together {{on the back of}} the diver, each with its own regulator) are unquestionably a redundant gas supply configuration, as there is no possibility of flow from one to the other during the dive. Use of independent twins for bailout requires the diver to ensure that at all times during the dive both cylinders have sufficient gas remaining to ensure a safe ascent, including any decompression that may be required. This requirement is based on the possibility that either of the cylinders may become unusable without warning. This requirement means that the cylinders are usually <b>breathed</b> <b>in</b> turn, and changed before the pressure drops to the critical pressure for that stage of the dive. This system is economical on gas, and highly reliable when done correctly, but relatively heavy on task loading.|$|E

500|$|Melua is {{occasionally}} {{referred to}} as an 'adrenaline junkie' because she enjoys roller coasters and funfairs and often paraglides and hang glides. She has skydived four times and taken several flying lessons, and in 2004 she was lowered from a 200-metre building in New Zealand at 60mph. When asked about Melua being an 'adrenaline junkie', Mike Batt said, [...] "she enjoys extremes, but in life her emotions are always in check". In November 2009, Melua came near to drowning after she <b>breathed</b> <b>in</b> and choked on a lungful of water when diving in a lake near Heathrow Airport.|$|E
500|$|Humans {{have two}} lungs, a right lung and a left lung. They are {{situated}} within the thoracic cavity of the chest. The right lung {{is bigger than}} the left, which shares space in the chest with the heart. The lungs together weigh approximately , and the right is heavier. The lungs {{are part of the}} lower respiratory tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and bronchioles, and which receive air <b>breathed</b> <b>in</b> via the conducting zone. The conducting zone ends at the terminal bronchioles. These divide into the respiratory bronchioles of the respiratory zone which divide into alveolar ducts that give rise to the microscopic alveoli, where gas exchange takes place. Together, the lungs contain approximately [...] of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli. Each lung is enclosed within a pleural sac which allows the inner and outer walls to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place, without much friction. This sac also divides each lung into sections called lobes. The right lung has three lobes and the left has two. The lobes are further divided into [...] bronchopulmonary segments and lobules. The lungs have a unique blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood from the heart in the pulmonary circulation for the purposes of receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the bronchial circulation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} bathing procedure {{consisted of}} merely reclining in natural pools of hot springs and cool creek water {{for long periods}} of time. [...] During the 1820s crude vapor baths stood over the springs, and bathers <b>breathed</b> <b>in</b> the vapors for extended periods of time. [...] Wooden tubs were added to some bathhouses in the 1830s. [...] Physicians began arriving in the 1850s, although many visitors did without their services; visitors remained from one week to two months.

2500|$|The minimum safe partial {{pressure}} of oxygen in a breathing gas is commonly {{held to be}} 16 kPa (0.16 bar). Below this {{partial pressure}} the diver {{may be at risk}} of unconsciousness and death due to hypoxia, depending on factors including individual physiology and level of exertion. When a hypoxic mix is <b>breathed</b> <b>in</b> shallow water it may not have a high enough ppO2 to keep the diver conscious.

Or <b>breathing</b> <b>in</b> short, he discerns, 'I am <b>breathing</b> <b>in</b> short'; or <b>breathing</b> out short, he discerns, 'I am breathing out short.'

He trains himself, 'I will <b>breathe</b> <b>in</b> calming bodily fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.' If it is pursued and well developed, {{it is said to}} bring great benefit according to the Anapanasati Sutta: [...] "This is how mindfulness of in-&-out breathing is developed & pursued so as to be of great fruit, of great benefit." [...] As for the training, the Anapanasati sutta states: On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in & of itself — ardent, alert, & mindful — putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world, on that occasion his mindfulness is steady & without lapse. When his mindfulness is steady & without lapse, then mindfulness as a factor for awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.|$|R

2500|$|Mayow {{argued that}} the same {{particles}} are consumed in respiration, because he found that when a small animal and a lighted candle were placed in a closed vessel full of air the candle first went out and soon afterwards the animal died. [...] However, {{if there was no}} candle present the animal lived twice as long. He concluded that this constituent of the air is absolutely necessary for life, and supposed that the lungs separate it from the atmosphere and pass it into the blood. It is also necessary, Mayow inferred, for all muscular movements, and he thought there was {{reason to believe that the}} sudden contraction of muscle is produced by its combination with other combustible (salino-sulphureous) particles in the body; hence the heart, being a muscle, ceases to beat when respiration is stopped. Animal heat also is due to the union of nitro-aerial particles, <b>breathed</b> <b>in</b> from the air, with the combustible particles in the blood, and is further formed by the combination of these two sets of particles in muscle during violent exertion.|$|E
2500|$|Smoking is a {{practice}} {{in which a}} substance is burned and the resulting smoke <b>breathed</b> <b>in</b> to be tasted and absorbed into the bloodstream. Most commonly the substance is the dried leaves of the tobacco plant which have been rolled into a small square of rice paper to create a small, round cylinder called a [...] "cigarette". Smoking is primarily practiced as a route of administration for recreational drug use because the combustion of the dried plant leaves vaporizes and delivers active substances into the lungs where they are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and reach bodily tissue. In the case of cigarette smoking these substances are contained {{in a mixture of}} aerosol particles and gasses and include the pharmacologically active alkaloid [...] nicotine; the vaporization creates heated aerosol and gas to form that allows inhalation and deep penetration into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream of the active substances occurs. In some cultures, smoking is also carried out as a part of various rituals, where participants use it to help induce trance-like states that, they believe, can lead them to spiritual enlightenment.|$|E
