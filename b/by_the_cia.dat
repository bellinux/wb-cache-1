5|$|He {{graduated}} from the University of Michigan in 1949 and worked for the U.S. Forest Service {{for the next two}} years. He was reassigned to Washington, D.C. in 1951, where he was hired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> to investigate forests of the Eastern Bloc. In 1956, Miskovsky obtained a law degree from the George Washington University Law School. He joined the legal office of the CIA, and was eventually promoted to the rank of assistant general counsel.|$|E
5|$|Project Isinglass was {{developed}} {{as a result of}} the vulnerability of existing manned reconnaissance aircraft, such as the Lockheed U-2 and the Lockheed A-12, to Soviet air defenses in the early 1960s, catalysed by the shooting down in May 1960 of Francis Gary Powers. Although there were continuing plans to overfly the Soviet Union with the A-12 – referred to <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> as Project Oxcart – these failed to come to pass, and the CIA began plans for an aircraft with superior performance to replace Oxcart.|$|E

5|$|The drone attacks {{carried out}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> in Pakistan rely on local informants, who can {{cross the border}} into Pakistan in a way CIA {{officers}} cannot. CIA officers at the base {{were involved in the}} coordination, targeting and surveillance of drone strikes aimed at the Afghan Taliban, the Haqqani network, the Pakistani Taliban and al-Qaeda. At the time of the attack, they were conducting an aggressive campaign against the Haqqani network, a radical group run by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son, Sirajuddin Haqqani.|$|E
5|$|Although far rarer {{than their}} prank cousins, {{exploding}} cigars {{used as a}} means to kill or attempt to kill targets in real life has been claimed, and is well represented as a fictional plot device. The most famous case concerning the intentionally deadly variety was an alleged plot <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> of the US in the 1960s to assassinate Fidel Castro. Notable real-life incidents involving the non-lethal ilk include an exploding cigar purportedly given by Ulysses S. Grant to an acquaintance and a dust-up between Turkish military officers and Ernest Hemingway after he pranked one of them with an exploding cigar.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{attacks the}} house where Breed is staying with the children, and incapacitates the mercenary, leaving him for dead. He {{establishes}} that the children are being used as drug mules to smuggle raw heroin into the country and locates Solomon Adeka, {{who had not been}} killed in Africa, but been turned into a heroin addict in order to control him. Adeka's older brother had been killed in London, ensuring Solomon became chief of the tribe whose lands held massive amounts of oil: as he was an addict, these rights were signed away in favour of Hulbert Linck. Linck was killed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> during the raid on the house.|$|E

Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of the theory that the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow does not believe that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E

5|$|Shoup {{was unable}} to {{directly}} influence the Johnson administration, which expanded U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He became increasingly wary of what he felt was undue influence <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> and big businesses on foreign policy. In 1964 during {{the debate over the}} Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Senator Wayne Morse wanted to call Shoup to testify against the measure, but was blocked by Senator J. William Fulbright. On 14 May 1966, Shoup began publicly attacking the policy in a speech delivered to community college students at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, California, for their World Affairs Day.|$|E

5|$|The Isinglass/Rheinberry {{concept was}} {{considered}} to be superior to spy satellites in a number of ways, including rapid turnaround time and quick response capability. As there was little funding to be had from the CIA budget, McDonnell developed the aircraft using its own funds, although technical support gleaned from Oxcart was supplied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA.</b> The McDonnell Isenglass/Rheinberry proposal's shape remains classified, although it has been described as being similar to the Space Shuttle, albeit much reduced in size. A 1/3 cross-sectional model of the aircraft was constructed to illustrate the principles used in its construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{family members}} are afraid to testify at the mock trial and at the real deposition; Buster fakes a coma, Lindsay and Lucille fake {{entering}} rehab, and Gob flees the country to perform in a USO Tour in Iraq. The deceptions are all uncovered by the prosecution, and in Iraq Gob is arrested for inadvertently inciting an anti-US riot. Buster and Michael travel to Iraq to rescue Gob, and while there, uncover evidence that the mini-palaces George Sr. built in Iraq were actually ordered and paid for <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> for wiretapping purposes. After this discovery, the US government drops all {{of the charges against}} George Sr. In the general confusion, everyone except George Michael forgets Maeby's sixteenth birthday.|$|E
5|$|Tung also {{headed a}} group run <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> in which ARVN {{personnel}} of northern origin infiltrated North Vietnam, posing as locals. The {{objective was to}} gather intelligence and sabotage communist infrastructure and communications facilities. The recruits were trained in bases at Nha Trang, Đà Nẵng, and sometimes offshore in Taiwan, Guam and Okinawa. Around eighty groups of operatives, each numbering six or seven men, were deployed in 1963. They entered the north via parachute drops or sampan journeys at night, but nearly all were captured or killed. The captives were frequently used in communist propaganda broadcasts. Tung was criticised for his management of the operations.|$|E
25|$|Coffin grew {{increasingly}} disillusioned {{with the role}} of <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> and <b>the</b> United States due to events including <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> involvement in overthrowing Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh of Iran in 1953, followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> orchestration of <b>the</b> coup that removed President Jacobo Árbenz in Guatemala in 1954.|$|R

5|$|A {{few days}} after his last meeting with the CIA, he led an assault against Matamoros along {{with a handful of}} supporters. The attack failed, and Castillo Armas was wounded and arrested. A year later, he bribed his way out of prison, and escaped back to Honduras. The {{engineer}} dispatched <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> to liaise with Castillo Armas informed them that Castillo Armas had the financial backing of Somoza and Trujillo. US President Harry S. Truman thereupon authorized Operation PBFORTUNE. Castillo Armas's stories of his revolt and escape from prison proved popular among the right-wing exiles in Honduras. Among these people, Castillo Armas claimed to still have support among the army, and began planning another revolt. His reputation was inflated by stories that he had escaped from prison through a tunnel.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Vietnamese {{military}} was highly factionalized in complicated and unusual ways, {{and it was}} not clear where the sympathies of the respective officers lied. Thi was pro-Buddhist, but he and Kỳ had been suspected of mooting a coup attempt against Khánh in September 1964, and he had also been reported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> in December 1964 as having vowed to kill Khánh. Although Kỳ had made comments hinting threats to Khánh, he was also known to be strongly opposed to nominally hardline Catholic Diệm supporterssuch as Thảowho were currently the frontrunners to launch the coup. Meanwhile, the likes of Thiệu, Có and Cang, whom the Americans favored, and were Catholic-aligned in more moderate ways, were cautious in comparison to the flamboyant and impetuous Kỳ and Thi. They maintained a guarded approach, waiting to see what the other officers would do, rather than boldly taking the initiative. For his part, Kỳ was reported by US intelligence to have privately predicted that Khánh would be ousted in an efficient manner without bloodletting and replaced by Thiệu.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{discovers that}} he has an ally who is also working {{undercover}} at the half-built resort, Felix Leiter, who has been recalled to duty <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> and is working ostensibly as an electrical engineer while setting up bugs in Scaramanga's meeting room. However, they learn that Scaramanga plans to eliminate Bond when the weekend is over. Bond's true identity is confirmed by a KGB agent and Scaramanga makes new plans to entertain the gangsters and the KGB agent by killing Bond while they are riding a sight-seeing train to a marina. However, Bond manages to turn the tables on Scaramanga and, {{with the help of}} Leiter, kill most of the conspirators. Wounded, Scaramanga escapes into the swamps, where Bond pursues him. Scaramanga lulls Bond off-guard and shoots him with a golden derringer hidden in his palm. Bond is hit but returns fire and shoots Scaramanga several times, killing him at last.|$|E

25|$|According to Max Holland, an {{internal}} investigation <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> counterintelligence staff found that the substance of Paese Seras allegations were not true and that neither Permindex or Centro Mondiale Commerciale were a front to channel funds to anti-communists.|$|R
5000|$|An {{investigation}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> {{inspector general}} concluded that <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> had no involvement in or knowledge of any illegal activities {{that may have}} occurred in Mena.

5|$|In 2013, Eisenberg {{reunited with}} Woody Harrelson for the magician heist film thriller Now You See Me, playing a world-famous {{close-up}} magician and street performer recruited into a secret group of elite magicians {{to pull off}} bank heists with magic tricks, redistributing the money from a wealthy businessman (Michael Caine) to victims of his corrupt capitalist schemes. That year he announced his plan to continue writing, for both stage and screen, as well as continuing to act. He debuted his second play, The Revisionist, and starred in Richard Ayoade's drama, The Double (2013), which was shot in 2012. In the following years, Eisenberg reprised his role as Blu in Rio 2 (2014), and starred alongside Kristen Stewart in the action comedy American Ultra (2015), playing a rogue sleeper agent being chased <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>C.I.A.</b>|$|E
5|$|In November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower {{was elected}} {{president}} of the US. Eisenhower's campaign had promised a more hawkish stance against communism. Many senior figures in his cabinet, including John Foster Dulles and his brother Allen, had close connections to the United Fruit Company, which made Eisenhower more strongly predisposed than Truman to support Árbenz's overthrow. In June 1954, the US trained and funded an invasion force led by Castillo Armas, backed by an intense campaign of psychological warfare <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA.</b> Árbenz resigned on 27 June 1954, ending the Guatemalan Revolution. From 1954 onwards Guatemala was ruled by a series of US-backed military dictators, leading to the Guatemalan Civil War. 200,000 civilians were killed in the war, and numerous human rights violations committed, including massacres of civilian populations, rape, aerial bombardment, and forced disappearances. 93% of these violations were committed by the United States-backed military, which included a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous Maya population in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Operation Kugown was {{the name}} given to the {{psychological}} warfare operation that had played {{an important part in}} the overthrow of Árbenz. During the coup, its primary targets had been the Árbenz government. After the conclusion of the coup, Kugown continued, targeting the rest of Guatemala, and the wider international audience. The aim of the operation was to disseminate derogatory information about Árbenz, and to convince Guatemalans—and the rest of the world—that Árbenz's regime had been communist-dominated. The use of documents from PBHistory for Operation Kugown began in August 1954. The standard method employed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> was to select a document that could be portrayed as incriminating and write an explanation covering it. This would then be released to the press by the Comite, so that the local agency could receive some credit. The Comite also released a short documentary film, titled Despues Descubrimos La Verdad ("Later We Discover the Truth"). Through these avenues news media in Guatemala and elsewhere in Central America were saturated with stories of how the Árbenz government had been controlled by communists.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{prominent}} {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAV) programs within the United States: that {{of the military and}} that of the Central Intelligence Agency (<b>CIA).</b> <b>The</b> military’s UAV program is overt, meaning that the public recognizes which government operates it and, therefore, it only operates where US troops are stationed. <b>The</b> <b>CIA’s</b> program is covert. Missions performed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA’s</b> UAV program do not always occur where US troops are stationed.|$|R
