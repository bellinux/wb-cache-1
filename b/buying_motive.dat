Every month the broker selects a fund of the month (FOM), generates attention by promoting it on the company's website and oers it at a substantially reduced front load fee. The broker's promotion strategy aims at generating a combined <b>buying</b> <b>motive</b> for the FOM related to attention and cost eects (a price pro-motion strategy). Using detailed individual portfolio holdings {{we are able to}} identify relevant drivers for in- and net-fund ows and are able to empirically separate the attention from the cost eects. Looking at the joint eect we nd that investors strongly react to the promotion strategy. Relating attention activated ows to behavioral and cost activated ows to rational buying decisions it turns out that ows are mainly driven by cost and not so much by attention eects. This leads us to conclude that investors decisions are governed by rational behav-ior and not necessarily by behavioral biases, an argument frequently found in the literature.

40|$|Research on {{consumer}} behaviour {{has revealed that}} the prospect of reaching a personal value is the virtual <b>buying</b> <b>motive.</b> Bearing this in mind, the researcher, {{as well as the}} marketer, is not only able to observe whether one product is preferred to another, but also to understand why this product is preferred. Hence, identifying consumers' personal values contributes to explaining consumer preferences and buying motives, which is of great importance for marketing practice. Personal values that are developed during the process of socialisation are part of a culture and differ depending on one's cultural background. Therefore, culture- specific values result in specific consumer behaviour. The aim of our paper is to combine research about buying motives (generally speaking, consumers' personal values) and about culture- specific consumption patterns. Knowledge of these cohesions is of great importance for marketing strategies. If there are differences between the personal values of consumers who are from different cultural backgrounds, this has {{to be taken into account}} by differentiating the strategic direction of marketing strategies, which should incorporate culture- specific product cognition. The following aspects of this issue will be discussed in the paper: · consumers buy products because of the resulting consequences, which satisfy consumer values · values are part of the culture, and therefore cause culture- specific consumer behaviour · the underlying motives for culture- specific consumer behaviour have to be included in marketing strategies. culture, values, consumer behaviour, marketing strategies, Marketing,...|$|E

Based on purchase data from household panels a causal model was developed and tested using the structural equation modelling method with SSI LISREL. The analysis revealed new insights about consumer behaviour regarding organic food. While the influence of the classical consumer segmentation criteria ‘income’ and ‘education’ was proven to be not significant, the purchase behaviour was primarily determined by selfish <b>buying</b> <b>motives.</b> Consumers <b>buy</b> organic products because they taste better, contain fewer residues and are considered to be healthier. In opposite, the influence of altruistic <b>buying</b> <b>motives</b> regarding environmental friendly behaviour was not significant.

40|$|Most {{studies of}} organic food demand {{are based on}} questionairs {{focussing}} on <b>buying</b> <b>motives.</b> Only {{a handful of studies}} estimate organic food demand and these all focus on food submarkets and must assume separability of the organic/non-oragnic nest of analysed food from other food submarkets. The soundness of this separability assumption may nevertheless be questioned since general attributes such as animal welfare and environmental effects are cited as <b>buying</b> <b>motives</b> for organic variants irrespective of food type in most surveys. The assumption of separabilety of nests of organic/non-oragnic variants of foods has, however, not been tested empirically. In this paper we exploit unique Danish micro level data where all food demand has been registered on a disaggregated good level and in all cases with an indicator of weather the good is of an organic or non-organic variant to test the separability assumption empirically. Our results indicate that the assumption should be rejected and further that the cross-price elasticity pattern resulting from estimation of a non-nested system is consistent with non-separability being caused by general organic food attributes such as animal welfare and environmental effects.

A successful example is the Producer-Fair-Milk-Initiative of the Hessian dairy Upländer Bauernmolkerei. Started in 2005, organic buyers are asked to pay an extra 5 eurocent per litre milk, which is transferred to the dairy’s farmers. The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyse consumer knowledge on the initiative and to investigate the most important <b>buying</b> <b>motives</b> for fair milk products. Furthermore, the importance consumers attach to the initiative’s central motives ‘fair prices’, ‘organic’ and ‘regional production’ is determined by asking them for their additional willingness to pay for these attributes of milk. By means of a standardised questionnaire 577 consumers were interviewed in six organic food shops and 565 interviews were statistically evaluated. The results illustrate that the central motives of the initiative are well known by a majority of consumers and represent important <b>buying</b> <b>motives</b> for these milk products. The dairy seems to be very successful in communicating the initiative’s objectives. Many organic consumers claim to be willing to pay higher prices for specific attributes.

This study uses sales data and a multilevel modeling approach to explain the market shares of sustainable products according to shelf layout factors, price level, price promotions, and consumer demographics. It argues {{that the effect of}} these variables differs between organic versus fair trade products, as <b>buying</b> <b>motives</b> might differ, organic buyers tend to be more loyal, and price is a more informative signal of quality for organic products. Results show that the number of facings has a positive relationship with the market share of fair trade brands, but not with the market share of organic brands. The same holds for the price difference with the leading brand, which is important for fair trade brands but not for organic brands. In contrast, an arrangement of the product category by brand is associated with higher market share for organic brands but not for fair trade brands. Additionally, placement at eye level and clustering of items benefits both types of sustainable brands, whereas they appear to be not very sensitive to price promotions.

By employing the MEC analysis methodology, the study further fulfils two additional aims: third, to obtain insights into the functional food-related <b>buying</b> <b>motives</b> of consumers; and fourth, to design a MEC hierarchy of consumption-relevant cognitive structures per age group in order to explain their functional food-related purchasing behaviour. The {{results of the study}} highlight health enhancement and health risk prevention through appropriate dietary choices as the most important motives of functional food purchasing for the two age groups, respectively. A special interest in eating enjoyment that results from functional food consumption and in trust that must surround those foods also emerge from both age groups. Moreover, some differences among the two age groups are prominent, such as that the early-middle-aged consumers show a great interest in knowing the origin of the functional product; while the young adults emphasize on functional foods’ convenience and (low) price. These results lead to the conclusion that functional foods should deliver their health benefits above and beyond the standard (high) perceived quality required by consumers from any common food product...|$|R

This study aimed to (1) investigate the position of outdoor environmental quality in house-buyers' preferences; (2) assess monetary values attributed to environmental externalities by the hedonic pricing method (HPM); and (3) test the applicability of HPM in China. The study area was Guangzhou, the major city of south China with a booming real-estate market. A questionnaire survey was conducted with households in new residences sold in 2004. The main <b>buying</b> <b>motives</b> were improving living quarters and floor area. Security concerns and a preference for high-rise buildings were somewhat unexpected. Good outdoor environment, including green space provision, proximity to parks, and views of green space and water, carried significant hedonic values. Differences between the submarkets {{of old and new}} towns were found; new town households expected apartments in high-rise blocks, exclusive residential land use, and views of green space, while old town households preferred proximity to shopping areas and workplaces, green space within the development and proximity to nearby parks.

The incentive to explore consumers' "black box" was given {{by the fact that}} changes in relation to nutritional issues have become apparent. The case of bread, particularly, attracts the attention of research as a product widely consumed that, however, has not been given much attention by researchers. L. T. approaches the subject from the psychological point of view and explores how people relate products with their personal values. L. T. was implemented so as to gain richer understanding as to how people translate product's characteristics into indicative connotation with respect to themselves. It has also created the basis for the second part of research by informing the attributes used in the C. E. The data was generated with the use of questionnaire that was completed by a small sample of individuals. The results revealed that bread type and the perceived bread healthiness are among the most important aspects consumers consider when buying bread. C. E. was used to examine how the inclusion of a functional ingredient affects consumer attitudes towards bread. An important feature of the C;E. design was the inclusion of the Dutch Eating Behavioural Ouestionnaire (D. E. B. O.) to collect information on participants underlying eating behaviours. The survey instrument employed a single postal mail shot. The results showed - again - that bread type is a major factor in determining choice and that the inclusion of a functional ingredient returned relatively small measures of value. The estimation of a Latent Class Model (L. C. M.) revealed differences in W. T. P. between segments. Also, segment membership can be partly explained by the D. E. B. O. Finally, an important finding is that respondents hold a stronger preference for a simple health statement compared or in addition to the benefits resulting from consuming a product that includes functional ingredients. iiEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Addictive {{consumption}} {{is an extreme}} form of consumer behaviour which, until recently, has been relatively unexplored and understudied. Addictive consumers <b>buy</b> for <b>motives</b> unrelated to the actual possession of the goods, and most purchases remain unused. Feelings of anticipation and excitement prior to and during the shopping experience are replaced by guilt and shame afterwards. Patterns of behavior are developed and maintained in secret {{over a period of}} time. This paper presents the results of a study of forty-six women in the UK who identified themselves as addictive consumers. Through phenomenological interviews, they describe their thoughts and experiences both within the shopping environment and in their everyday lives. A rich picture of the reality of being an addictive consumer emerges, {{not only in terms of}} the consumption activity but also the precursors to, the consequences, and the means of self-managing the activity. Addictive consumers are presented here as women who have adopted what is traditionally considered to be a male-based mechanism for coping with depression or unsatisfactory situations -that is, doing something rather than thinking about their problems. These women have chosen to engage in a familiar, enjoyable and socially acceptable activity, shopping, to gain some kind of control in their lives. Paradoxically, the activity is developed and maintained to such an extent that it controls them. The consumption behavior itself is almost identical in each case, but addictive consumers are not a homogeneous group. Four patterns or sub-groups of addictive consumers emerge - the existential addict, the revenge addict, the mood repair addict and the serial addict. ...|$|R

The produced heat is used to drive a {{power generation}} unit generating electric energy or for direct district heating. Waste-to-Energy is a viable method to treat solid waste and to produce energy. The Waste-to-Energy power generation market has significantly grown throughout the past decade. This is rather based on an increasingly important waste management issue than on higher demands for energy. Even in light of a growing market, literature concerned with the customers’ buying behavior and customer motives {{in the process of}} industrial buying in this segment is very limited. Therefore, this study investigates these aspects in further detail and determines patterns in the Waste-to-Energy market in Germany. This research project solves and fills the problem and knowledge gap concerned with the affecting factors, influences and drivers in industrial buying in Germany. Since this is a very global perspective and exceeds the capacities of this study, more specific aspects such as the buying centers, buying situations or supplier selection criteria are assessed. Pursuing an approach on the philosophical stances of constructivism and interpretivism, this research topic has been approached by conducting phone interviews with representatives from power plant operators and public authorities. These representatives mostly fill positions in purchasing and environmental departments, among others. A number of Waste-to-Energy power plants in Germany have been investigated by interviewing individuals involved in the planning, purchasing and construction process. The information they provided on the topics of the plants’ backgrounds, <b>buying</b> centers, customer <b>motives,</b> <b>buying</b> decision phases and buyer-seller relations have been analyzed in order to draw conclusions and to answer the research questions. It has emerged from this research study that the Waste-to-Energy power plants investigated were built primarily in order to solve waste management issues and not to produce energy. In these cases, power generation is just a byproduct of the waste incineration. Furthermore, it has evolved that constructions of power plants are rolled out as new tasks or modified re-buys, but never as straight re-buys. Additionally, buyers do not only focus on suppliers’ characteristics such as their pricing and their products’ quality, but also on their financial situation and performance, capability to meet deadlines and environmental impacts...|$|R
40|$|Food {{quality has}} been a strong focus of the BÖL {{research}} programme since it started in 2001. Among other things, the policy on EU organic regulations was supported with research projects; for example regarding the discussion concerning the admission of meat curing agents (nitrite and nitrate) in 2006. In a project on this subject, consumer acceptance of cured meat products, not using these curing agents, {{has been described as}} surprisingly positive, and the practical use of alternative materials and technologies was evaluated. It was found that the implementation of new technologies to reduce the use of curing agents was mainly inhibited by their lacking acceptance in practice, technical adaptation needs and investment in product development as well as disputed legal issues. As part of another project, a guide for processors was created, within which the new methods and solutions were presented. To enhance knowledge transfer regarding the new EU hygiene standards for organic meat proces-sors in 2008, a number of general information and specific documents for the admission application as well as templates for the necessary internal controls were developed. The general use and suitability of new organic food additives were also examined. Different sub-stances, which could serve as binding agents or antioxidants, were tested. Locust bean gum, guar gum, xanthan and agar agar showed a sufficient bond-stabilising effect without affecting the sensory quality of the products. Substances such as ascorbic acid, citric acid, rosemary extract, ginger and lemon juice showed a satisfactory effect against oxidative browning reactions. Furthermore, the use of rye sprouts as an ingredient in wheat bread produced very positive results: a study found that the volume, crumb firmness and crumb elasticity could be improved. The use of ingredients from yam (Dioscorea batatas) was investigated regarding the potential sensory and health benefits for flour blends. In another project, the use of yeast extract in organic foods was reviewed. It was shown here that there is very little research about the components and nutritional effects of yeast extract; also a survey among experts could not come to a clear formulation of conclusions. Thus, it was recommended that each processor should decide for or against the use of yeast extract in each particular case. Since 2008, an additive list is now being published annually and a website has been created where the manufacturers of additives can register themselves and sign up their organically certified and non-certified commercial products for evaluation. The data from the National Nutrition Survey II (NVS II) in 2010 were analysed in detail, looking at organic buying habits in relation to socio-demographic characteristics, parameters of health and nutrition behaviour as well as food consumption. Over 13, 000 participants, aged between 18 and 80 years, were included in this survey. The derived recommendations show considerable potential. It was found for example, that organic buyers compared with non-organic buyers are more likely to lead a healthier lifestyle. Altruistic <b>buying</b> <b>motives,</b> such as interest in fair trade, animal welfare and the renunciation of the use of genetic modification, have been identified as a central driver of organic buying behaviour. It was also recommended, in addition to ethical arguments, to integrate health benefits more directly into the marketing of organic food. Further results from the BÖLN research on food quality and processing are continuously published at www. bundesprogramm-oekolandbau. de...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between hedonic shopping motivations and compulsive buying in developed and emerging countries using a study with 520 female shopping mall visitors in four countries representing two developed (the Netherlands and Germany) and two emerging (Turkey and Russia) markets. Our results indicate that hedonic shopping motivations are signiﬁcantly related to compulsive buying. However, diﬀerent hedonic motivations appear {{to contribute to the}} development of compulsive buying in emerging and developed countries. In developed markets gratiﬁcation seeking, idea shopping, and role play were found to be the key hedonic motivations contributing to compulsive buying. In emerging markets, however, thepicturelooksverydiﬀerent. Interestingly,neitherofthetwomotivations(gratiﬁcationseekingandidea shopping) closely related to key drivers of compulsive buying according to the existing literature, predominantly based on developed countries, is found to be linked to compulsive buying in emerging markets. Instead, in such countries the mainmotivation is found to beadventure seeking. Moreover, interestingly, roleplay hasa negative eﬀect on compulsive buying, which is the opposite of what we found in developed countries. Our results, together with the limited research in emerging countries, call for in-depth and thorough research in such countries on the moderating role of national culture and economic conditions in the development of compulsive <b>buying</b> and shopping <b>motives.</b> We additionally provide several implications for marketers...|$|R
