50|$|In negotiations, {{anchoring}} {{refers to}} the concept of setting a boundary that outlines the <b>basic</b> <b>constraints</b> for a negotiation; subsequently, the anchoring effect is the phenomenon in which we set our estimation for the true value of the item at hand. In addition to the initial research conducted by Tversky and Kahneman, multiple other studies have shown that anchoring can greatly influence the estimated value of an object. For instance, although negotiators can generally appraise an offer based on multiple characteristics, studies have shown that they tend to focus on only one aspect. In this way, a deliberate starting point can strongly affect the range of possible counteroffers. The process of offer and counteroffer results in a mutually beneficial arrangement. However, multiple studies have shown that initial offers have a stronger influence on the outcome of negotiations than subsequent counteroffers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDirection {{relations}} between extended spatial objects are important commonsense knowledge. Recently, Goyal and Egenhofer proposed a relation model, {{known as the}} cardinal direction calculus (CDC), for representing direction {{relations between}} connected plane regions. The CDC {{is perhaps the most}} expressive qualitative calculus for directional information, and has attracted increasing interest from areas such as artificial intelligence, geographical information science, and image retrieval. Given a network of CDC constraints, the consistency problem is deciding if the network is realizable by connected regions in the real plane. This paper provides a cubic algorithm for checking the consistency of complete networks of <b>basic</b> CDC <b>constraints,</b> and proves that reasoning with the CDC is in general an NP-complete problem. For a consistent complete network of <b>basic</b> CDC <b>constraints,</b> our algorithm returns a ‘canonical’ solution in cubic time.

40|$|Abstract. Global {{constraints}} {{have recently}} been introduced for use in local search based constraint solvers. Traditionally, local search for constraint satisfaction is based on local minimization of a cost function, which is usually the number of constraints violated in the current state. Applying this method to a constraint solver with global constraints presents difficulties because the search often becomes unbalanced [...] a global constraint is semantically equivalent {{to a set of}} <b>basic</b> <b>constraints</b> but still contributes as little to the cost as a single basic constraint. In this paper, we present a new virtual cost calculation strategy for global constraints in which we replace the cost for global constraints with a more accurate cost function. To remedy the problem with unbalanced search, the virtual cost is based on semantically equivalent <b>basic</b> <b>constraints</b> [...] for a global constraint, these are the <b>basic</b> <b>constraints</b> semantically encapsulated in the global constraint. We show how to calculate the virtual costefficiently for the well-known global constraints AllDifferent and Serialize. 1 Introduction Local search has been used numerous times in the past for solving hard problems and for problems with limits on the solving time. A few approaches for using local search in more general constraint satisfaction have been proposed [3, 7, 4, 2]. Most of these methods are based on modified or extended hill-climbing algorithms, iteratively improving a single complete assignment of the variables in the problem. Typically, the improvement transition is done by changing the value assigned to a single variable in the problem, thus exploring the neighborhood of the current assignment. These methods aim to minimize a cost function, usually defined by the number of constraints violated by the current assignment...|$|E
40|$|A novel logic {{program like}} language, weight {{constraint}} rules, is developed for answer set programming purposes. It generalizes normal logic programs by allowing weight constraints {{in place of}} literals to represent, e. g., cardinality and resource constraints and by providing optimization capabilities. A declarative semantics is developed which extends the stable model semantics of normal programs. The computational complexity of the language is shown {{to be similar to}} that of normal programs under the stable model semantics. A simple embedding of general weight constraint rules to a small subclass of the language called <b>basic</b> <b>constraint</b> rules is devised. An implementation of the language, the smodels system, is developed based on this embedding. It uses a two level architecture consisting of a front-end and a kernel language implementation. The front-end allows restricted use of variables and functions and compiles general weight <b>constraint</b> rules to <b>basic</b> <b>constraint</b> rules. A major part of the work is the development of an ecient search procedure for computing stable models for this kernel language. The procedure is compared with and empirically tested against satis ability checkers and an implementation of the stable model semantics. It offers a competitive implementation of the stable model semantics for normal programs and attractive performance for problems where the new types of rules provide a compact representation...|$|R
