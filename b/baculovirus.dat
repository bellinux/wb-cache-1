2500|$|There {{have been}} anecdotal reports of {{oseltamivir}} (Tamiflu) reducing disease severity and hospitalization time in canine parvovirus infection. The drug may limit {{the ability of}} the virus to invade the crypt cells of the small intestine and decrease gastrointestinal bacteria colonization and toxin production. [...] However, due to the viral DNA replication pattern of parvovirus and the mechanism of action of oseltamivir, this medication has not shown to improve survival rates or shorten hospitalization stay. [...] Lastly, recombinant feline interferon omega (rFeIFN-ω), produced in silkworm larvae using a <b>baculovirus</b> vector, has been demonstrated by multiple studies to be an effective treatment. However, this therapy is not currently approved in the United States.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the newest}} niches for baculoviruses-based {{technologies}} is their use as vectors for mammalian cell transduction and gene therapy applications. However, an outstanding safety issue related to such use is the residual expression of viral genes in infected mammalian cells. Here we show that infectious <b>baculoviruses</b> lacking the major transcriptional regulator, IE 1, can be produced in insect host cells stably transformed with IE 1 expression constructs lacking targets of homologous recombination that could promote the generation of wt-like revertants. Such ie 1 -deficient <b>baculoviruses</b> are unable to direct viral gene transcription to any appreciable degree and do not replicate in normal insect host cells. Most importantly, the residual viral gene expression, which occurs in mammalian cells infected with wt <b>baculoviruses</b> is reduced 10 to 100 fold in cells infected with ie 1 -deficient <b>baculoviruses.</b> Thus, ie 1 -deficient <b>baculoviruses</b> offer enhanced safety features to baculovirus-based vector systems destined for use in gene therapy applications...|$|R
40|$|Hymenoptera is a {{very large}} and ancient insect order {{encompassing}} bees, wasps, ants and sawflies. Fossil records indicate that they existed over 200 million years ago and about 100 million years before the appearance of Lepidoptera. Sawflies have been major pests {{in many parts of the}} world and some have caused serious forest defoliation in North America. All <b>baculoviruses</b> isolated from sawflies are of the single nucleocapsids phenotype and appear to replicate in midgut cells only. This group of viruses has been shown to be excellent pest control agents and three have been registered in Canada and Britain for this purpose. Sawfly <b>baculoviruses</b> contain the smallest genome of all <b>baculoviruses</b> sequenced so far. Gene orders among sequenced sawfly <b>baculoviruses</b> are co-linear but this is not shared with the genomes of lepidopteran <b>baculoviruses.</b> One distinguishing feature among all sequenced sawfly viruses is the lack of a gene encoding a membrane fusion protein, which brought into question the role of the budded virus phenotype in Gammabaculovirus biology...|$|R
50|$|<b>Baculovirus</b> gene {{transfer}} into Mammalian cells, known from scientific research articles as BacMam, {{is the use}} of <b>baculovirus</b> to deliver genes to mammalian cells.

40|$|If the {{relationships}} between <b>baculoviruses</b> and their insect hosts are subject to coevolution, this should lead to long-term evolutionary effects such as the specialization of these pathogens for their hosts. To test this hypothesis, a phylogeny of the Baculoviridae, including 39 viruses from hosts of the orders Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera, was reconstructed based on sequences from the genes lef- 8 and ac 22. The tree showed a clear division of the <b>baculoviruses</b> according {{to the order of}} their hosts. This division highlighted the need to reconsider the classification of the <b>baculoviruses</b> to include one or possibly two new genera.

40|$|AbstractWe {{established}} a hybrid baculovirus-T 7 RNA polymerase system for transient expression in mammalian cells. Two recombinant <b>baculoviruses</b> carrying cDNA of bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase, {{with or without}} a nuclear localization signal, under the control of a mammalian promoter were constructed.
