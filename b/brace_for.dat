5|$|Kiedis had {{remained}} sober the entire tour and maintained positive disposition during shows. Navarro, however, was growing tired of touring, {{and that was}} beginning to grate on his fellow band-mates. Kiedis suffered an additional injury in Prague after falling off the stage while attempting to execute a back flip. He was forced to wear a back <b>brace</b> <b>for</b> the next few shows, which restricted his actions to the area around his microphone. After shows in Paris and London, the band returned home to Los Angeles. Kiedis began taking drugs once again, though {{he forced himself to}} discontinue after several weeks. The band was then asked to play in the North Pole for roughly 100 contest winners of a concert set up by Molson, a Canadian beer company. While the show was mildly motivating to the band, they returned home after two days.|$|E
5|$|LeMond {{was in a}} {{car crash}} on the morning of January 30, 2013. He was driving through wintery and icy {{conditions}} to his dentist in Wayzata, Minnesota, when he lost control of his car. LeMond suffered a concussion and was left with no memory of the incident. According to Associated Press, a Plymouth police report says LeMond left the road, hit a fence and shrubs, and then hit an embankment before ending up in the backyard of a home. LeMond may have lost consciousness before the accident, according to his wife Kathy, and he suffered a compression fracture in his back and would have to wear a <b>brace</b> <b>for</b> three months. The accident curtailed LeMond's public appearances {{in the first half of}} 2013, but he made a full recovery.|$|E
5|$|Of the 158 {{people on}} board, 73 {{died as a}} result of the crash. The lead flight {{attendant}} was the only crew member to survive. Of the surviving passengers, 72 adults and children over three years old sustained serious injuries, while two sustained minor injuries. Of the 11 infants, two sustained minor injuries, eight were seriously injured, and one, Kenneth Fernando Martinez, the four-month-old son of Gloria L. Martinez, died. The surviving steward testified that there had been no communication from the cockpit as to the unfolding situation and, thus, no warning in the end to assume brace positions. The NTSB report held that, had passengers been warned ahead of time to <b>brace</b> <b>for</b> impact, the severity of some injuries might have been avoided.|$|E

5|$|Gilberto's doctor {{ordered him}} to wear a back <b>brace</b> <b>for</b> three months to aid the healing of the {{fractured}} bone. Gilberto returned to his native Brazil {{for the duration of}} his rehabilitation. During his time there, he doubted whether he would ever be able to play football again, due to speculation that his injury could threaten his career. Despite his concerns, his long rehabilitation time paid off as he made a full recovery. He made his footballing comeback in Arsenal's 4–1 victory over Norwich City on 22 April 2005. During the whole 2004–05 season, Gilberto was injured for 7 months and played only 17 games. His absence, combined with Arsenal's slump in form at the time, led to much discussion regarding the importance of Gilberto to the Arsenal team; some suggesting that Arsenal struggled without him. Gilberto's difficult 2004–05 season ended in consolation as Arsenal finished runners-up in the Premier League and won the FA Cup against Manchester United in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|Mertens' agent Søren Lerby {{confirmed}} on 16 June 2013 {{that the}} player {{had agreed to}} sign with Napoli. He became Rafael Benítez's first signing as new Napoli manager after a reported fee of €9.5million was agreed with PSV. He made his Serie A debut on 25 August 2013, coming on as a second-half substitute for Marek Hamšík in a 3–0 win over Bologna.

5|$|Occurring a {{year after}} Hurricane Donna, {{officials}} in the Florida Keys took precautions to <b>brace</b> <b>for</b> potential impact from the storm. The United States Navy flew their planes out of Key West, while Coast Guardsmen evacuated Alligator Reef Light, American Shoal Light, and Sombrero Key Light. Ships docked at Key West sailed out to sea to ride out the squalls. On the morning of September7, a hurricane watch was issued from the entire coast of Louisiana eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. On September8, a hurricane watch was issued along the southwest coast of the state from Vermilion Bay westward. It was later extended westward to include the entire coast of Texas, and eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. A portion of the hurricane watch from Aransas Pass, Texas to Grand Isle, Louisiana was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 1600UTC on September9. An estimated 500,000people fled the coasts of Texas and Louisiana, making it the largest evacuation {{in the history of}} the United States, at the time. Further, at least half of those people were from Texas. In small towns along the coast of Texas, 90100% of their populations evacuated, while 20% of people left the larger cities. Many in Galveston stayed due to protection from the Galveston Seawall.|$|E

5|$|While {{the injury}} {{did not require}} surgery, Raymond {{retained}} the back <b>brace</b> <b>for</b> six weeks and was largely immobile for two months. In late July, he received a text message from Boychuk, explaining that his intention was not to injure with the hit. Unable to train on the ice or with weights, Raymond spent the 2011 off-season largely inactive, {{with the exception of}} cardiovascular workouts. Five-and-a-half months after sustaining his back injury, Raymond was set to return to the Canucks' lineup for a game against the Predators on December 1, 2011. However, the team failed to file the proper paperwork to the NHL by the 5 p.m. deadline, delaying Raymond's return until the following game. He recorded six points (three goals and three assists) in his first seven games back, but struggled to produce offensively {{for the remainder of the}} season. In March 2012, he was made a healthy scratch for the first time in three years.|$|E

5|$|Early in the 2008–09 season, Strachan praised Brown for re-inventing {{himself as}} a more {{defensive}}-minded player. Despite taking on these defensive duties, Brown still contributed some goals, such as against his former club Hibernian on 25 October. Brown won the SPL Player of the Month Award for October 2008. In the January transfer window he was linked with a £9 million move to Portsmouth, with Tottenham also reported {{to be interested in}} him.

5000|$|Back braces- In {{the cases}} when the {{underlying}} reason for deformity is postural and is detected before the growing age of bones, braces can be used. Braces provide {{support to the}} muscles and bones, as well as apply corrective pressure to reduce the curvature. The <b>braces</b> <b>for</b> Kyphoscoliosis have to be designed such that it becomes effective with both abnormal curvatures in the coronal and sagittal plan. The latest in brace design is {{through the use of}} CAD/CAM, which is available only in few developed countries such as Germany. The efficacy of <b>braces</b> <b>for</b> correcting curvature issues has been analyzed by a few studies. In one such study, it was found that bracing led to successful outcomes in 72% of patients and correlated strongly with hours of braces worn. 2 However, compliance with wearing <b>braces</b> <b>for</b> a period up to 18 hours or more can be physiologically and psychologically limiting, especially when one considers the teenage period.|$|R
