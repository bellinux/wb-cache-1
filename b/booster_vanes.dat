40|$|Reaction {{force has}} always been one of the main {{characterization}} parameters for impact events. Today, a set of force transducers are a common and valuable tool to measure reaction forces. But the force signals are often influenced by vibrations of the supporting structures. Many other attempts were already taken in the past to use other methods to measure force, such as ballistic pendulums, Hopkinson bars, etc., all having their advantages and disadvantages. In this work, a multi-axial force measurement tool is developed to serve in a test campaign of bird strike experiments on <b>booster</b> <b>vanes.</b> The idea is to give some well-chosen mass three rotational degrees of freedom and acquire the transferred rotational momentum from an optical measurement, which is a direct measure for the impact force. The tool is validated experimentally and numerically using a simplified steel vane. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
2500|$|On January 21, the NTSB found {{evidence}} of soft-body damage in the right engine along with organic debris including a feather. The left engine also evidenced soft body impact, with: [...] "dents on both the spinner and inlet lip of the engine cowling. Five <b>booster</b> inlet guide <b>vanes</b> are fractured and eight outlet guide vanes are missing." [...] Both engines, missing large portions of their housings, {{were sent to the}} manufacturer for examination. On January 31, the plane was moved to Kearny, New Jersey. The bird remains were later identified by DNA testing to be Canada geese, which typically weigh more than engines are designed to withstand ingesting.|$|R
