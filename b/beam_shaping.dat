50|$|Ultra high {{intensity}} lasers are now {{commonly used in}} several fields of physics research, including X-rays, wakefield acceleration, proton generation and ICF, with the common idea of intensely focusing a laser beam to energy densities that can reach 1022 W/cm2 on a target. To achieve such a goal, the laser beam typically passes through several amplification stages and is transported with larger and larger optical components. As a result, the beam is affected by thermal effects and optical aberrations which distort the wavefront and affect the focusing quality. This decreases light intensity on the target. Usually, both spectral and spatial phases are adaptively controlled {{in order to achieve}} the required focusing. Over the last 2 decades, adaptive optics for wavefront correction and <b>beam</b> <b>shaping</b> have been commonly used in laser facilities by means of a wavefront sensor that measures the spatial phase and a deformable mirror that corrects it. Adaptive Optics systems (AOs) are now a must have in ultra-{{high intensity}} facilities, {{with some of the most}} recent systems needing several AOs to function.. Recently Imagine Optic developed mechanical actuator based deformable mirrors to specifically address the phase correction in laser systems. Key points of this technology are the optical quality, the capacity of correction, great stability and linearity and simplified maintenance requirements.|$|E
40|$|The Transcranial Doppler {{ultrasound}} {{technique is}} widely used for detecting velocity changes in the middle cerebral artery. However, flow changes inferred from velocity alone {{may be subject to}} error if the cross-sectional area of the vessel changes during a recording. One potentially ideal method for measuring changes in middle cerebral artery size is the Doppler signal power method. This is based on the theory that the power of a Doppler signal is proportional to the volume of blood from which the signal originates. In practice a number of factors other than vessel size influence signal power and hence may invalidate the technique. This thesis documents an investigation of the feasibility of using the Doppler signal power to measure changes in middle cerebral artery size. The main factors influencing signal power were considered. In-vitro recordings from a wall-less flow phantom showed a non-proportional relationship between power and channel size. This was deduced to be caused primarily by non-uniform insonation and high pass filtering. Following from these results, non-uniform insonation was identified as the main source of error for in-vivo recordings. An investigation of the effects of temporal bone on <b>beam</b> <b>shape</b> showed that <b>beam</b> <b>shape</b> across the middle cerebral artery is likely to be highly distorted and vary unpredictably between individuals. Theoretical modelling was used to predict the errors caused by <b>beam</b> <b>shape</b> in power changes detected from the middle cerebral artery, and demonstrated a variable error magnitude dependent on <b>beam</b> <b>shape,</b> vessel size, vessel position and beam angle. A novel technique for correcting the Doppler power spectrum for the effects of <b>beam</b> <b>shape</b> was proposed, and performed well when tested with theoretical and in-vitro spectra. Finally, an initial investigation of the correction technique using in-vivo spectra provided important information regarding future investigations of the in-vivo use of the Doppler power method...|$|R
