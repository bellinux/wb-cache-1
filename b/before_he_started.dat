25|$|The year <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> composition, Wagner had {{abandoned}} his {{first attempt at}} writing an opera, Die Hochzeit (The Wedding). There {{were a number of}} difficulties facing new German-language opera in the 1830s. First there was deemed to be a lack of good quality libretti to set. This may have influenced Wagner's decision to write the libretto for Die Feen himself. Second, there was a fear among the authorities in Germany and Austria that the performance of operas in German would attract nationalist and revolutionary followers. This would have added to the difficulties faced by a novice composer seeking an opportunity for his new opera to be performed.|$|E

His Requiem in D minor of 1849 is the earliest work Bruckner himself considered worthy of preservation. It shows the clear influence of Mozart's Requiem (also in D minor) and similar works of Michael Haydn. The seldom performed Missa solemnis, composed in 1854 for Friedrich Mayer's installation, was the last major work Bruckner composed <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> to study with Simon Sechter, {{with the possible exception}} of Psalm 146, a large work, for SATB soloists, double choir and orchestra.|$|E
