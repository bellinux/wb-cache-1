50|$|Crossley {{has written}} books in logic, {{mathematics}} and computer science. He {{is known as}} the lead author of the book What is Mathematical Logic. Co-written by some of his students, the book popularized the subject to the interested layman. Many of Crossley's doctoral students have gone on to be professors themselves and have written books in the field of mathematics or computing, including Peter Aczel, Wilfrid Hodges, John Lane <b>Bell</b> and <b>Rod</b> Downey.|$|R

50|$|Bell {{was born}} on the Akrotiri Royal Air Force station in Cyprus in 1966, the son of pilot <b>Rod</b> <b>Bell</b> and teacher Jean Bell. Graham’s love of skiing started at ages 5 {{when his father was}} posted to Edinburgh, Scotland. He learned to ski in the Cairngorm Mountains and Hillend dry slope. By the time the family moved to Yorkshire, England (where his father was posted), Graham and his brother Martin were both racing {{full-time}} on the World Cup circuit, although they developed close ties with Harrogate dry ski slope hold coaching camps there in the summer. <b>Rod</b> <b>Bell</b> continued to fly with the RAF teaching at the Central Flying School. In 2005 when Graham flew with the Red Arrows as part of the BBC’s coverage of the Great North Run, he was surprised to find 5 of the 9 pilots had been taught by his father.|$|R
2500|$|Associated {{with the}} central {{individuals}} were {{a large number of}} grave goods, including a large number of repoussé and plain gold plaques, ear <b>rods,</b> <b>bells,</b> greaves and beads. There were also a number of stone projectile points and celts. [...] The most famous of the goods associated with these individuals is the cast gold composite effigy animal pendant with an emerald embedded in its back. This was found lying bottom up atop the gold plaques that covered the two central individuals.|$|R
40|$|Bell’s 'Lorentzian Pedagogy' {{has been}} extolled as a {{constructive}} {{account of the}} relativistic contraction of moving <b>rods.</b> <b>Bell</b> claimed advantages for teaching relativity through the older approach of Lorentz, Fitzgerald and Larmor. However, he describes the differences between their absolutist approach and the relativistic one as philosophical, and claims that the facts of physics do not force us to choose between them. Bell’s interpretation of the physics of motion contraction, and therefore of constructivist as opposed to principle approaches, is indeterminate. His flawed pedagogy never directly addresses the difference between Fitzgerald and Lorentz contractions...|$|R
25|$|In 1992, Kevin Davies {{wrote and}} {{directed}} a documentary entitled The Making of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Davies had previously worked on the stage show at the Rainbow Theatre, and, while working for Pierce Animation Studios in 1980, had introduced Alan <b>Bell</b> to <b>Rod</b> Lord, leading to the animation for the TV series. For the documentary, Davies used many photographs and home movies he shot during the 1980 production of the series and recorded new interviews in October 1992 with the cast and crew. New footage of Simon Jones, David Dixon and Michael Cule, in character, were shot at the farm in Sussex used as Arthur Dent's house, and incorporated into the documentary with some references to So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, such as Arthur finding his home intact, and placing his (animated) Babel fish into a goldfish bowl. BBC video released the sixty-minute documentary on VHS in 1993. Footage {{not included in the}} original documentary was included in the 2002 DVD release of the series. The documentary itself has not (as of 2005) been transmitted on TV.|$|R
50|$|Wind chimes are {{a type of}} {{percussion}} instrument {{constructed from}} suspended tubes, <b>rods,</b> <b>bells</b> or other objects that are often made of metal or wood. The tubes or rods are suspended along with some type of weight or surface which the tubes or rods can strike when they or another wind-catching surface are blown by the natural movement of air outside. They are usually hung outside of a building or residence as a visual and aural garden ornament. Since the percussion instruments are struck according to the random effects of the wind blowing the chimes, wind chimes have been considered an example of chance-based music. The tubes or rods may sound either indistinct pitches, or fairly distinct pitches. Wind chimes that sound fairly distinct pitches can, through the chance movement of air, create simple melodies or broken chords.|$|R
40|$|Design {{requirements}} for the cabin, cabin system, flight controls, engine installation, and wing-fuselage interface that provide adequate interior volume for occupant seating, cabin ingress and egress, and safety are presented. The fuselage structure must be sufficient to meet the loadings specified in the appropriate sections of Federal Aviation Regulation Part 23. The critical structure must provide a safe life of 10 (exp 6) load cycles and 10, 000 operational mission cycles. The cabin seating and controls must provide adjustment to account for various pilot physiques and to aid in maintenance and operation of the aircraft. Seats and doors shall not bind or lockup under normal operation. Cabin systems such as heating and ventilation, electrical, lighting, intercom, and avionics must {{be included in the}} design. The control system will consist of ailerons, elevator, and rudders. The system must provide required deflections with a combination of push <b>rods,</b> <b>bell</b> cranks, pulleys, and linkages. The system will be free from slack and provide smooth operation without binding. Environmental considerations include variations in temperature and atmospheric pressure, protection against sand, dust, rain, humidity, ice, snow, salt/fog atmosphere, wind and gusts, and shock and vibration. The following design goals were set to meet the requirements of the statement of work: safety, performance, manufacturing and cost. To prevent the engine from penetrating the passenger area {{in the event of a}} crash was the primary safety concern. Weight and the fuselage aerodynamics were the primary performance concerns. Commonality and ease of manufacturing were major considerations to reduce cost...|$|R
