5|$|Later that year, the {{director}} planned another film {{with the same}} production company starring Mohanlal, which was titled G for Gold. Filming was scheduled to <b>begin</b> <b>on</b> 10 January 2014 in Kozhikode and Kasargode, but production did not <b>begin</b> <b>on</b> schedule due to Ranjith's dissatisfaction with the screenplay. He revised the screenplay and re-titled the film as Loham. Loham was announced in February 2015.|$|E
5|$|Filming was to <b>begin</b> <b>on</b> 21 May 2011: a {{week after}} the release of Kapoor's Ragini MMS. But due to {{production}} delays, it began a week later. Balan, a religious person, organised a puja on the sets before principal photography began.|$|E
5|$|In June 1968, an {{agreement}} was reached where the state Transportation Assistance Authority would pay $2 million and Penn Central would pay $2.5 million for the 11 Metroliners for Harrisburg service. On July 14, a 4-car train was tested on the line, with several demonstration runs for officials on August 21. In early October, several test trains proved {{the viability of the}} planned sub-3-hour schedules. Substation modifications later that month and a legal settlement between Budd and Penn Central in November paved the way for service to <b>begin.</b> <b>On</b> December 20, Penn Central announced that Metroliner service would <b>begin</b> <b>on</b> January 16, 1969.|$|E

5|$|According to Walter Breen, Snowden {{most likely}} chose the {{combination}} of the Indian Head and the laurel wreath as it was the lowest relief of any of the options, and could be expected to strike well. On November 4, 1858, Snowden wrote to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb about the Indian Head design, and two days later wrote to Longacre, informing him that it was approved. Longacre was to prepare the necessary dies for production, which was to <b>begin</b> <b>on</b> January 1, 1859.|$|E
5|$|After {{agreement}} {{from the}} Cardiff Athletic Club, the freehold {{of the south}} ground was transferred solely to the WRU in July 1968. Work could then <b>begin</b> <b>on</b> the new National Stadium. Glamorgan County Cricket Club would move to Sophia Gardens and the cricket ground to the north would be demolished and a new rugby union stadium built for Cardiff RFC, who would {{move out of the}} south ground, allowing the National Stadium to be built, for the sole use of the national rugby union team.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, the United States Weather Bureau began issuing {{tropical}} cyclone warnings as a collaborative observation network for cities along the U.S. coastline, and {{the season was}} defined between June 15 and November 15. In 1964, the season was extended to <b>begin</b> <b>on</b> June 1 and end on November 30, which remains the official length of the season. About 97% of all {{tropical cyclone}}s form within this time span, and activity usually peaks between August and October. After Tropical Storm Ana formed in May 2015, former American Meteorological Society president Marshall Shepherd used Twitter to question whether the season should begin earlier. James Franklin of the National Hurricane Center believed there was little advantage to changing {{it because of the}} rarity of off-season storms, noting that May storms only formed on average once every six years since the advent of satellite imagery. Franklin opined that the season could <b>begin</b> <b>on</b> May15 with little difficulty, coinciding with the beginning of the Pacific hurricane season, but an earlier start would be costlier and interfere with off-season work.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, {{trying to}} solve the problem of lack of a {{suitable}} mobile 152mm howitzer, the design bureau headed by F. F. Petrov started to work privately on a new howitzer, based on the carriage of the M-30 and the barrel of the M-10 (which was fitted with a muzzle brake in order to reduce the recoil and thus prevent damage to the lighter carriage). The approach allowed production to <b>begin</b> <b>on</b> the new howitzer almost immediately from the stockpile of parts for both earlier guns. Given the war situation and shortages of artillery, this solution was both elegant and expedient.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} his illness and Slayer's {{upcoming}} participation in the Australian Soundwave Festival tour that was set to <b>begin</b> <b>on</b> February 26, 2011, the band {{made the decision to}} play the dates without Hanneman, and on February 16, 2011, brought on Gary Holt (guitarist of the band Exodus) to fill in for him. Pat O'Brien joined as Slayer's temporary second guitarist when Holt left the tour to play with Exodus. In 2012, bandmate Tom Araya announced a recovery from the disease. However, later in February 2013, Kerry King revealed continuing health problems that kept Hanneman from working.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} 1932 fiscal year, figures showed that the state incurred a $2 million deficit. Kentucky was also unable to secure significant financial assistance under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal because the state was often unable to raise the required matching funds.|$|E

Early filming took place at Pinewood Studios, and around London, with scenes variously featuring Craig and Harris at Bond's flat, and Craig and Kinnear travelling down the River Thames.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April, Hitler issued Operational Order No. 6, {{which called}} for the Kursk {{offensive}} operation, codenamed Zitadelle ("Citadel"), to <b>begin</b> <b>on</b> 3 May or shortly thereafter.

For the offensive to succeed it was deemed essential to attack before the Soviets {{had a chance to}} prepare extensive defences or to launch an offensive of their own. Some military historians have described the operation using the term blitzkrieg (lightning war); other military historians do not use the term in their works on the battle.|$|E
