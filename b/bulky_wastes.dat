40|$|Household bulky waste, {{defined as}} ‘any large items you would {{normally}} take {{with you when}} moving house’ constitutes 56 % of fly-tipped household waste. Although fly-tipping, especially the disposal of the bulky household waste stream by way of fly-tipping, is little studied, it causes {{a wide range of}} social and environmental problems. Legitimate means of disposal available to householders include council collection, household waste recycling centres, private companies and charities. This study was aimed at identifying the key drivers for fly-tipping <b>bulky</b> <b>wastes</b> using the county of Hampshire, UK as a case study area. The study indicates that fly-tipping of bulky items is a significant problem, particularly in areas of high deprivation and population density, and areas with a large proportion of rented accommodation. The findings also illustrate the distinct service requirements of different age groups and that no single, generic approach to bulky waste management can be applied universally...|$|E
40|$|Facing supply {{uncertainty}} of <b>bulky</b> <b>wastes,</b> the capacitated multi-product stochastic network design model for bulky waste recycling is proposed in this paper. The {{objective of this}} model is to minimize the first-stage total fixed costs and the expected value of the second-stage variable costs. The possibility of operation costs and transportation costs for bulky waste recycling is considered while making the first-stage decisions about the network configuration. Integrating harmony search with sample approximation approach, a meta-heuristic is elaborated to solve the stochastic network design problem of bulky waste recycling, i. e. to decide where bulky waste recycling centers should be opened, and to determine which disposition procedure should be introduced. Several numerical examples are utilized to demonstrate the validness of the harmony-search-based sample approximation algorithm (HSSAA). In addition, the HS-SAA is compared to a genetic algorithm previously applied to the same problem. HS-SAA has advantages in the solution quality...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Bioenergy is very {{important}} for implementing the Kyoto agreement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by replacing fossil fuels. The viability of implementing energy production systems using biomass in Catalonia (Spain) needs to be analysed due to Catalonia’s particular and diverse geographical and climate characteristics. Forestry wastes are the main biomass source, although three more types of biomass have been included (agricultural wastes, industrial waste, and gardening, pruning and <b>bulky</b> <b>wastes).</b> We consider the harvesting, transportation and energy conversion stages. Combustion is regarded as the most viable energy conversion technology at present, therefore three different combustion scenarios are studied (small scale, medium scale and large scale plants). First, an energy, environmental and economic analysis was carried out. Second, an integrated sustainability evaluation which incorporates the first analysis ’ results was elaborated in discussion groups and with qualitative tools. The results show that energy production systems using forestry biomass can be implemented in Catalonia if costs are reduced through harvesting and transportation. Political support, incentives for forest managers and a forestry wastes market development are also necessary. In Mediterranean countries, in addition to energy recovery from a renewable source, an appropriate management of forests is convenient for forest fire prevention...|$|E

40|$|Carbonization {{is a kind}} of {{pyrolysis}} {{process to}} produce char from organic materials under an inert atmosphere. In this work, chars derived from various solid wastes were characterized from the standpoint of fuel recovery and pretreatment of waste before landfilling. Sixteen kinds of municipal and industrial solid wastes such as residential combustible wastes, non-combustible wastes, <b>bulky</b> <b>wastes,</b> construction and demolition wastes, auto shredder residue, and sludges were carbonized at 500 ℃ for 1 h under nitrogen atmosphere. In order to evaluate the quality of char as fuel, proximate analysis and heating value were examined. The composition of raw waste had a significant influence on the quality of produced char. The higher the ratio of woody biomass in waste, the higher heating value of char produced. Moreover, an equation to estimate heating value of char was developed by using the weight fraction of fixed carbon and volatile matter in char. De-ashing and chlorine removal were performed {{to improve the quality of}} char. The pulverization and sieving method seems to be effective for separation of incombustibles such as metal rather than ash. Most char met a 0. 5 wt% chlorine criterion for utilization as fuel in a shaft blast furnace after it was subjected to repeated water-washing. Carbonization could remove a considerable amount of organic matter from raw waste. In addition, the leaching of heavy metals such as chrome, cadmium, and lead appears to be significantly suppressed by carbonization regardless of the type of raw waste. From these results, carbonization could be considered as a pre-treatment of waste before landfilling as well as for fuel recovery...|$|E
40|$|The <b>bulky</b> <b>waste</b> {{fraction}} of municipal waste arisings is under-exploited {{in terms of}} recycling and reuse. Currently, third-sector <b>bulky</b> <b>waste</b> recycling and reuse schemes (e. g. furniture reuse organisations (FROs)) redistribute approximately 2 · 5 million items annually, largely to needy families and individuals, thus diverting – or at least delaying – landfill disposal. At the same time, several other benefits {{can be derived from}} the actions of <b>bulky</b> <b>waste</b> recycling schemes. This paper brings together a range of studies assessing the volume of <b>bulky</b> <b>waste</b> in terms of estimated tonnages and percentage of municipal waste arisings, and possibilities for augmenting current reuse. Turning to the efficacy of existing collection and reuse services, this paper considers: the various routes available for disposal; the operational effectiveness of FROs; and key aspects of the relationship between local authorities and FROs, such as coordination in communication and collection, funding and management of partnerships. Despite the apparent availability of bulky items for redistribution, current funding and institutional constraints may prevent FROs reusing all such item...|$|R

40|$|Household <b>bulky</b> <b>waste</b> {{includes}} {{large and}} heavy {{items such as}} furniture and electrical appliances. Local authorities in England provide two options for disposing of these items: a special collection service, often involving a collection charge, and HouseholdWaste Recycling Centres (HWRCs), where residents can take their waste free of charge. Local private companies and community or charitable organisations may also collect certain bulky items. In this study, 1450 householders in 3 cities across England were surveyed about {{a range of issues}} relating to the disposal of bulky items. Questionnaires were hand delivered to households pre-selected using the national Index of Multiple Deprivation in order to compare how disposal of bulky items differs with level of affluence. Sixty-five percent of householders had discarded bulky items in the 12 months prior to the survey. The principal disposal route was found to be the HWRC, with almost 60 % of residents who had discarded items using this method. Only 19 % of the householders had used the special collection services. In low-affluence areas, lower car ownership made residents more reliant on council collections of bulky items, and HWRCs were used less frequently. Householders were found to be satisfied with the collection service they had received. The study demonstrates that there is significant capacity for reuse and recycling of bulky items at a national level. Using the Waste Hierarchy, these management options are environmentally preferable to landfill, which is the widely-used disposal method at present. Where items are reused there are also social benefits for the community or charity groups involved, volunteers employed, and recipients of the items. Only the current <b>bulky</b> <b>waste</b> handlers – local authorities, can implement the logistical, and in some cases financial, solutions that are required to increase recovery in this waste stream...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{approximately}} 400 third sector organisations set {{up across the}} UK since the 1970 s with the primary function of collecting used furniture and electrical appliances and re-distributing them for the relief of hardship. In addition to the resulting socio-economic outputs of these organisations, their role in diverting waste from landfill and increasing re-use and recycling rates raises their standing in the current political climate of high emphasis on improving waste management practices. This paper reports on the current size of the furniture and appliance re-use sector, how re-use organisations operate, {{and the level of}} re-use and recycling associated with their activities. It was found that significant improvements in the re-use rate of local authority <b>bulky</b> <b>waste</b> collection services may be obtained if a third sector re-use organisation takes over the service; where re-use organisations collect household <b>bulky</b> <b>waste</b> on behalf of the LA, a 40 % re-use rate was achieved, compared to the 2 – 3 % average of waste collection departments. In most areas of the UK, these two sectors are not well integrated at present and this results in potentially re-usable items being disposed of to landfill or incinerated. Establishing partnerships between the two sectors has the potential to benefit both but this will probably require system and culture changes. A significant current barrier is that LA waste management departments are hampered by the current (well-intended) quantitative waste management system coming into conflict with the unquantified, positive social value generated by the distribution of previously used bulky household items to disadvantaged groups by re-use organisations. If added to the environmental improvements and high quality of service provided by third sector-run services, the effort involved in setting up such partnerships may be regarded more favourably...|$|R
