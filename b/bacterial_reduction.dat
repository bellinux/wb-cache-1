In this study, raw, shell eggs were inoculated with Salmonella enteritidis and exposed to ozonation treatment.

These results show effective in-package ozonation treatment reducing Salmonella enteritidis on raw, shell eggs without significant effect on measured egg quality over time. Benefits of in-package ozonation include no heating, low power requirements (less or equal to 50 Watts), short treatment time (seconds to minutes), and adaptability into existing processes.

As a result of oxidation of pyrite in strip mine dumps of this region, numerous mine drainage lakes have pH values < 3 and are characterized by high concentrations of dissolved sulphate and ferrous iron. Using chemical and isotopic techniques, we tested in laboratory bottle experiments the extent to which the addition of degradable organic carbon to acid lake water and sediments could stimulate <b>bacterial</b> (dissimilatory) sulphate <b>reduction.</b> The overall goal was to evaluate whether <b>bacterial</b> sulphate <b>reduction,</b> and subsequent formation of sedimentary sulphide minerals, could generate enough alkalinity to potentially neutralize the acid lakes in Lusatia. Pyruvate, glucose, succinic acid, lactate, ethanol, acetate, and various industrial by-products were added in various concentrations to original lake water and sediments in glass bottles and incubated between 4 and 12 weeks in darkness. The extent of <b>bacterial</b> sulphate <b>reduction</b> was determined by analyzing the concentrations and the isotopic compositions of sulphate in the water column, and the contents and δ 34 S values of various sedimentary sulphur compounds at the beginning and the end of the experiments. <b>Bacterial</b> sulphate <b>reduction</b> was significantly enhanced after addition of pure substances (lactate, pyruvate, acetate, and ethanol) resulting in elevated pH values (4. 5 to 6. 0) in the bottle water at the end of the experiments.

Extremely high sulphate and magnesium ion concentrations occur in lake waters and decline rapidly with depth in pore waters through the sulphate reduction zone. Ultimately sulphate ions are totally consumed but magnesium ions are replenished, presumably from desiccated cyanobacterial sheaths. Carbonate concentrations in pore waters reach levels up to 100 times those of normal seawater. Most-probable-number counts show that large populations of sulphate-reducing bacteria are present in sediment cores, while sulphur isotope analysis of residual lakewater sulphate indicates that microbial fractionation takes place in all the study lakes. Microbes from the lakes were cultured in the laboratory under anoxic conditions and viable populations were injected into vials containing a sterilised granular substrate immersed in a simulated lakewater solution. Falls in the levels of sulphate ion concentration and rising pH in selected vials were interpreted as due to active <b>bacterial</b> sulphate <b>reduction</b> accompanied by increased concentrations of carbonate. After 1 month, subspherical nano-grains of dolomite were precipitated. This study proposes that <b>bacterial</b> sulphate <b>reduction</b> overcomes kinetic constraints on dolomite formation by removing the sulphate ions and releasing magnesium and calcium ions from neutral ion pairs, and by generating elevated carbonate concentrations in a hypersaline and strongly electrolytic solution.

5000|$|Sulfur {{is intimately}} {{involved}} in production of fossil fuels {{and a majority of}} metal deposits because of its ability to act as an oxidizing or reducing agent. The vast majority of the major mineral deposits on Earth contain a substantial amount of sulfur including, but not limited to: sedimentary exhalative deposits(SEDEX), Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) and copper porphyry deposits. Iron sulfides, galena and sphalerite will form as by-products of hydrogen sulfide generation, as long as the respective transition or base metals are present or transported to a sulfate reduction site. [...] If the system runs out of reactive hydrocarbons economically viable elemental sulfur deposits may form. Sulfur also acts as a reducing agent in many natural gas reservoirs and generally ore forming fluids have a close relationship with ancient hydrocarbon seeps or vents. [...] Important sources of sulfur in ore deposits are generally deep-seated, but they can also come from local country rocks, sea water, or marine evaporites. The presence or absence of sulfur is one of the limiting factors on both the concentration of precious metals and its precipitation from solution. pH, temperature and especially redox states determine whether sulfides will precipitate. Most sulfide brines will remain in concentration until they reach reducing conditions, a higher pH or lower temperatures. [...] Ore fluids are generally linked to metal rich waters that have been heated within a sedimentary basin under the elevated thermal conditions typically in extensional tectonic settings. The redox conditions of the basin lithologies exert an important control on the redox state of the metal-transporting fluids and deposits can form from both oxidizing and reducing fluids. Metal-rich ore fluids tend to be by necessity comparatively sulfide deficient, so {{a substantial portion of the}} sulfide must be supplied from another source at the site of mineralization. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>reduction</b> of seawater sulfate or a euxinic (anoxic and H2S-containing) water column is a necessary source of that sulfide. When present, the δ34S values of barite are generally consistent with a seawater sulfate source, suggesting barite formation by reaction between hydrothermal barium and sulfate in ambient seawater.|$|E
