5|$|According to a MinnPost poll, Minnesotans <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> Republican {{legislature}} {{more for}} the shutdown. Overall, 42% said Republicans in the legislature were more responsible, 21% said the DFL governor was more responsible, and 22% volunteered an answer that they were equally to blame. As expected, partisans <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> other party more; only 10% of Republicans <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> legislature more, and only 2% of DFLers blamed Dayton more. Following the shutdown, DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing appropriations bill that would prevent government shutdowns {{in the event of}} disagreements between the governor and legislature, as she had done in several past sessions. The House commissioned a policy brief from its research department, published in December 2011, that looked into what such a bill would require. The brief noted that such ideas had been considered before, including after the 2005 shutdown, and had been abandoned.|$|E

5|$|By 1982 16 {{per cent}} of Yorkshire's public houses {{were tied to}} Stones. Bass closed the Cannon Brewery in April 1999 {{with the loss of}} 57 jobs. Bass <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> closure on the steep decline in sales of cask {{conditioned}} beers (nationally there had been a 14 per cent decline in sales of cask beer over the previous 12 months) which the brewery produced. The brewer realised £1 million in efficiency savings by closing the brewery. The Campaign for Real Ale <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> brewery's closure on Bass' failure to promote their cask conditioned products. As well as Stones Bitter, the Cannon brewed the small scale Bass Special, Bass Light and Bass Mild brands from the mid-1990s as declining Stones volumes left the brewery with spare capacity. Bass Light and Bass Mild had been sold in the Sheffield area as Stones Mild and Stones Dark Mild respectively.|$|E

5|$|A {{storm in}} June 2011 caused public {{utilities}} including the Briarcliff library and Law Memorial Park's public pool and playing fields to be flooded. When Trump had renovated the course, his workers made unauthorized changes to its drainage system, {{which made the}} course look and play better for golfers. The alterations lowered the system's water capacity and thus raised water levels by about six feet. The Trump Organization met with the village over the issue, though {{it did not take}} corrective actions. After negotiations ended, the village billed the club $238,353. The Trump Organization <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> flooding on a village drainage pipe which lacked a grate, and <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> conflict on then-Briarcliff mayor William Vescio, who owns a company that previously came into conflict with Trump. Vescio denied the relation to the previous conflict and claimed that the flooding was caused by rocks and trees at washed down the hill from the golf club.|$|E
5|$|According to Ming Pao, {{family members}} of the victims were {{dissatisfied}} with the official investigation and held a sit-in protest, calling for a fair judgement.

Others blamed an ineffective firefighting system for the high death toll, and were dissatisfied that they were not given more details about the fire.|$|E

Others will <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> textbook authors and publishers for pursuing sales rather than quality. Some will attach <b>blame</b> to <b>the</b> politicians who exploited antievolution sentiment to get into, or remain, in office. Others will <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> conservative Protestant clergy. Some may <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> whole educational system for failing to teach Americans how to evaluate evidence. And many will <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> evolutionists for bringing the matter up in the first place. But whatever the lesson one wishes to draw from the history of biology textbooks since the Scopes trial, we think the story itself is worth knowing. That the textbooks could have downgraded their treatment of evolution with almost nobody noticing is the greatest tragedy of all...|$|R
5|$|An Army report {{released}} in 2001 <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> {{breakdown of the}} 65th on the following factors: a shortage of officers and noncommissioned officers, a rotation policy that removed combat-experienced leaders and soldiers, tactics that led to high casualties, an ammunition shortage, communication problems between largely white, English-speaking officers and Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican enlisted men, and declining morale. The report also found bias in the prosecution of the Puerto Ricans, citing instances of continental soldiers who were not charged after refusing to fight in similar circumstances, before and after Jackson Heights.|$|E
