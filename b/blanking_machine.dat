In this paper, laser bending of tailor <b>machined</b> <b>blanks</b> has been investigated experimentally. For this purpose, effects of start point of scan path and also irradiation direction relation to step (position of variance in sheet thickness) of the tailor <b>machined</b> <b>blank</b> on the obtained bending angles are investigated. The results show that irradiation path from rim of thick section to rim of thin section of the tailor <b>machined</b> <b>blank</b> leads to more bending angles in comparison with irradiation path from thin section to thick section of tailor <b>machined</b> <b>blank.</b> Also, it is concluded from results that when the step of tailor <b>machined</b> <b>blank</b> is positioned in the opposite direction to the laser beam, more bending angles are obtained in the laser formed tailor <b>machined</b> <b>blank</b> in comparison with positioning of step of tailor <b>machined</b> <b>blank</b> toward the laser beam.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} several factors influencing {{the cost of a}} particular raw material blank, the policy changes based on this study, and the cost reduction accomplished by means of these changes. This general approach may be employed to reduce the raw material cost of a variety of machined components. The operation in question was to purchase hot rolled metal blanks and from these to machine closely dimensioned plates. To allow for process variabilities and to assure sufficient material removal to yield a high quality finished surface, we bought blanks thicker, hence heavier, than the finished plates. The material was expensive and the machining chips were not recoverable, so this excess blank weight represented a substantial annual cost. To minimize this loss we considered reducing the process variabilities, sorting blanks to narrow the range released for machining and to divert the others to less critical applications, and reducing the minimum thickness of <b>blanks</b> selected for <b>machining,</b> tolerating some loss due to machining rejects with the expectation that this would be outweighed by the reduction in cost of the average <b>blank</b> <b>machined.</b> As a result of these studies we were able to reduce the blank weight 8 %, thus reducing our material cost for this single component more than $ 50, 000 per year.

5000|$|Horizontal {{bandsaws}} {{hold the}} workpiece stationary while the blade swings {{down through the}} cut. This configuration is used to cut long materials such as pipe or bar stock to length. Thus {{it is an important}} part of the facilities in most machine shops. The horizontal design is not useful for cutting curves or complicated shapes. Small horizontal bandsaws typically employ a gravity feed alone, retarded to an adjustable degree by a coil spring; on industrial models, the rate of descent is usually controlled by a hydraulic cylinder that bleeds through an adjustable valve. When the saw is set up for a cut, the operator raises the saw, positions the material to be cut underneath the blade, and then turns on the saw. The blade slowly descends into the material, cutting it as the band blade moves. When the cut is complete, a switch is tripped and the saw automatically turns off. More sophisticated versions of this type of saw are partially or entirely automated (via PLC or CNC) for high-volume cutting of <b>machining</b> <b>blanks.</b> Such <b>machines</b> provide a stream of cutting fluid recirculated from a sump, in the same manner that a CNC machining center does.|$|R

A scientific and methodological approach to the establishment of energy-efficient processing conditions is proposed, being based on the optimization of fabrication procedures according to new energy efficiency criterion. A study of advantages and disadvantages of known methods of fabrication procedures optimization according to the criterion of the lowest specific energy intensity has been conducted. A new integral indicator of energy efficiency of cutting operation is deefined as a ratio of constructional material specific energy intensity to the specific energy consumption in the cutting area. The methods of determining the energy efficiency figure with respect to the properties of the processed material, the behaviors of its deformation and fracture, type of formed chippings and technological purpose of processing are offered.

This paper describes the first time Nb has been directly identified in mineral and freshwaters, using inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometry (ICP-SFMS). The scant values of Nb concentrations in freshwaters published include many values which are very close, or directly below, the detection limit of the technique used; when low values are reported, the techniques used often include solid phase extraction preconcentration; with the associated difficulty in obtaining low blanks and risk of incomplete resin desorption.
