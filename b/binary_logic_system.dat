However, due to exponential growth of transistor density and in particular due to tremendously increasing power consumption, researchers expect that "Conventional Technologies" like Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor will reach their limits in near future. To further satisfy the needs for more computational power, speed, less size etc. alternatives are needed. Reversible Computation is the emerging field and alternative of conventional technologies. Reversible Computation is emerging as a promising solution and likely to work on extremely low power technologies and offer high speed computations. The reversibility retains the capability to retrieve the input data from output and minimizes heat dissipation. As migration to new technology leave a lot of work done in current technology will make the acceptability difficult. One side familiarly with new technology and other side transformation of old circuit designs to new technology will pose a challenge to designers. A need for convertibility of irreversible circuit to reversible circuit was felt that can make a quick start and keep the development on track. In this dissertation a logic circuit design entry based on <b>binary</b> <b>logic</b> <b>system</b> has been taken up that can provide the ease of circuit design in <b>binary</b> <b>logic</b> <b>system</b> and output as reversible circuit.

Doping of these optically active materials into nematic liquid crystals (LC's) induced a cholesteric phase. The handedness of the dopant controls the direction and magnitude of the helical twist in the cholesteric phase. Irradiation of these matrices with circularly polarised light leads to reversible photoswitching processes which, induce an enantiomeric excess of one stereoisomer, and either a left or right handed helix is generated. These mirror image isomers represent the 1 and O states of <b>binary</b> <b>logic.</b> Such <b>systems</b> have potential applications in three-dimensional memory storage devices. Selective excitation of these bichromophoric molecules at 305 nm leads to an intra-molecular energy transfer from the donor keto chromophore to the exocyclic double bond {{at the opposite end of}} the rigid bicyclo[3. 3. 0]octane spacer. We have investigated the extent of the achievable photoresolution and observed the magnitude of the helical pitch that can be induced in the nematogen PCB - 7. Seven novel trigger groups were synthesised and their properties investigated; (i) Hanessian non-ester moieties, (ii) Mosher esters, (iii) aliphatic esters, (iv) propargyl ester, (v) biphenyl ester, (vi) alkyl, biphenol and polyfluoro esters, and (vii) PCH- 7 ester.

Group (i) triggers were initially investigated but our model studies suggested that the synthesis of a library of molecules based on this synthetic route would be problematic. Group (iii) esters displayed lower dissymmetry then their parent acid and required to be doped in too high a concentration, compromising the integrity of the LC host.
