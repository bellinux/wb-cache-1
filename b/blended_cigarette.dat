The mean transfer rate was 11. 3 %; thus = 46 % of the tobacco-specific carcinogen in the smoke came from the tobacco, and the remainder was synthesized during smoking. [...] J Natl Cancer Inst 58 : 1841 - 1844, 1977. Tobacco chewing and smoking are associated with cancer of the oral cavity and esophagus (1 - 5). NNN has been identified in tobacco products and shown to be an esophageal carcinogen in rats (6).

40|$|The {{possibility}} that ingredients added to tobacco {{contribute to the}} addictiveness of cigarette smoking was evaluated by comparing cessation rates of smokers of traditional <b>blended</b> <b>cigarettes</b> to those of smokers of flue-cured cigarettes. Such a comparison is a valid means of assessing cigarette ingredients as traditional <b>blended</b> <b>cigarettes</b> contain ingredients (> 20), whereas flue-cured cigarettes contain no or very few ingredients. Separate analysis of 108 treatment groups and 108 control groups from randomized clinical trials of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) were performed by multiple logistic regressions. The results of these analyses demonstrated slightly higher quit rates for smokers of <b>blended</b> <b>cigarettes</b> (OR = 1. 90, 95 % Cl 1. 70 – 2. 13 and OR = 1. 32, 95 % Cl 1. 14 – 1. 53 for treatment and control groups, respectively). The control groups were also investigated using classification tree analysis from which no difference in quit rates were observed for smokers of either type of cigarette. Further analyses showed that studies that utilized {{a high level of}} psychological support in conjunction with NRT produced at least a two-fold increase in quit rates compared to studies that utilized a low level of psychological support. It was also demonstrated that there is a large difference when results were reported by sustained abstinence compared to point prevalence. Additional meta-analyses found the pooled OR for NRT treatment to be in exact agreement with a recent review that assessed the effectiveness of NRT. Overall these results strongly suggest that ingredients used in the manufacture of traditional <b>blended</b> <b>cigarettes</b> do not increase the inherent addictiveness of cigarettes...|$|R

40|$|Catechol and alkylcatechols {{are known}} co-carcinogens present in {{cigarette}} smoke. Hydroquinone, although nongenotoxic, can form a metabolite with nephrotoxic properties {{and is a}} potential human carcinogen. The formation of dihydroxybenzenes during smoking originates with the pyrolysis of several precursors from tobacco. These include cellulose, chlorogenic acid, rutin, etc. The present study attempts to quantitate the contribution of chlorogenic acid and rutin {{to the formation of}} dihydroxybenzenes and of some alkyldihydroxybenzenes. Also it estimates the contribution to the formation of dihydroxybenzenes from other potential precursors including glucose, fructose, sucrose, cellulose, pectin, starch, and lignin. The study was done in three parts: 1. pyrolytic evaluation of the amount of dihydroxybenzenes in smoke generated from isolated potential precursors; 2. analysis of smoke from cigarettes made from a variety of tobaccos (14 single grades) and two <b>blended</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> followed by correlations of dihydroxybenzenes yield with the tobacco content of various suspected precursors; 3. addition of chlorogenic acid or rutin to several tobaccos followed by the smoking of the spiked cigarettes and measurement of dihydroxybenzenes yield increase. The study shows that for a variety of singlegrade cigarettes and for two <b>blended</b> <b>cigarettes</b> (one being the 2 R 4 F Kentucky reference), the contribution of chlorogenic acid and of rutin to the formation of catechol and hydroquinone in smoke depends on the blend. For the 2 R 4 F cigarette, the contribution from chlorogenic acid is 8. 7 % for catechol, and 7. 7 % for hydroquinone (for ISO smoking protocol). For the same cigarette, the contribution from rutin is 3. 7 % for catechol and 5. 1 % for hydroquinone. The results of the study are in agreement with a previously reported finding indicating that chlorogenic acid contributes about 13 % to the catechol formation in smoke for the 1 R 1 Kentucky reference cigarette.

A simple, rapid and reliable fluorescence assay was developed for the measurement of H 2 O 2 based on the catalytic activity of hemoglobin using 10 -acetyl- 3, 7 -dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red) as the substrate. The proposed method was applied to determine the H 2 O 2 deliveries from mainstream cigarette smoke of 30 Chinese (5 blended and 25 Virginia) and two reference cigarettes (3 R 4 F and 1 R 5 F) under two machine smoking regimes.

Thermal imaging {{was used to}} determine the average maximum surface coal temperatures during smolder of cigarettes of different tobacco types. The thermal imaging camera was calibrated against a reference blackbody. An emissivity correction was necessary since the set point temperatures of the reference blackbody did not correspond to the measured temperatures of the reference blackbody. A 0. 87 camera emissivity was applied to provide accurate coal temperatures at a corrected emissivity of approximately 1. The average maximum surface coal temperatures during smolder of unfiltered single-tobacco-type cigarettes and a commercial <b>blend</b> <b>cigarette</b> were determined (with the camera lens focused parallel to the cigarette), and no discernible differences among them were found. The calculated average maximum surface coal temperature during smolder for all cigarettes was 584 AA± 15 °C. During smolder, thermocouples were used to measure the temperature of the gas phase (along the central axis of coal), and the thermal imaging camera was used to measure the temperature of the solid phase of the coal's surface. Using thermocouples, the peak coal temperatures {{in the center of the}} coal during smolder for three filtered single-tobacco-type cigarettes were 736 - 744 °C. Peak coal temperatures, measured by thermal imaging, on the surface of the coal (with the camera lens focused coaxially with the coal and the ash removed) for the same three single-tobacco-type cigarettes had a range of 721 - 748 °C. There was good correspondence between the two techniques. These results confirm that during smolder the gas-phase temperature inside the coal (as measured with the thermocouple) and the solid-phase temperatures beneath the ash (as measured with the camera) are in near thermal equilibrium. With proper calibration, a thermal imaging system is a good alternative to thermocouples for measuring cigarette coal temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Formation of dihydroxybenzenes in {{cigarette}} smoke {{is a subject}} of considerable interest because some dihydroxybenzenes are co-carcinogens, (e. g., catechol and certain alkylcatechols), and others such as hydroquinone can form metabolites that have toxic or carcinogenic properties. This present study describes the contribution of tobacco quinic acid (or (1 S, 3 R, 4 S, 5 R) - 1, 3, 4, 5 -tetrahydroxycyclohexanecarboxylic acid) and myo-inositol (or (1 R, 2 R, 3 S, 4 S, 5 R, 6 S) -cyclohexane- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexol) {{to the formation of}} dihydroxybenzenes in {{cigarette smoke}}. The study is a continuation of a previous one showing the contribution of chlorogenic acid and rutin as precursors for these compounds (6). The yields of dihydroxybenzenes formed by pyrolysis of quinic acid and myo-inositol are relatively high and both quinic acid and myo-inositol can be present in some tobacco types at levels as high as 1 % by weight. The level of these compounds makes them potentially important contributors to the formation of dihydroxybenzenes in cigarette smoke. Similar to the previous study on other dihydroxybenzene precursors from tobacco, this present study was done in three parts: 1) pyrolytic evaluation of the amount of dihydroxybenzenes in smoke generated from isolated quinic acid and myoinositol; 2) analysis of smoke from cigarettes made from a variety of tobaccos (14 single grades) and two <b>blended</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> followed by correlations of dihydroxybenzene yields from these cigarettes with the level of quinic acid and myo-inositol in the tobaccos; 3) addition of quinic acid or myo-inositol to several tobaccos followed by the smoking of the spiked cigarettes and measurement of the dihydroxybenzenes yield increase. The study performed on a variety of single-grade tobacco cigarettes and for two blended-tobacco cigarettes (one being the 2 R 4 F Kentucky reference) shows that the contribution of quinic acid and of inositol to the formation of catechol and hydroquinone in smoke depends on the blend, as previously shown for chlorogenic acid and rutin. The study results suggest that quinic acid and myo-inositol may be major contributors to the formation of dihydroxybenzenes in cigarette smoke. Although the calculations do not provide precise numbers for the contribution of quinic acid and inositol to the formation of dihydroxybenzenes, these results suggest that the contribution could be as high as 50 to 60 % of the level of dihydroxybenzenes...|$|R

Moving to a smaller circumference cigarette significantly reduces the relative smoke content of pyrolytically generated species such as benzo[a]pyrene, aromatic amines, and CO but increases the content of species arising from more oxidative burning such as formaldehyde. Similar data were recently obtained for Canadian cigarettes (ISO 33082000), where reductions in aromatic amines, benzo[a]pyrene, carbonyls, volatiles, CO, and increases in formaldehyde and ammonia yields were observed for superslim cigarettes {{in comparison to the}} Canadian Benchmark dataset.
