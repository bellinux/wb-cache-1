Prepared mixes are used by some doughnut shops. Doughnut shops may prepare old-fashioned doughnuts by loading the <b>batter</b> <b>into</b> the hopper of a doughnut maker, which upon turning a hand crank, drops a formed doughnut into a deep fryer. Doughnut makers are also used for other doughnut varieties, such as cake doughnuts, yeast doughnuts, cream filled, and jelly filled doughnuts.|$|E

2500|$|In {{baseball}} slang, {{it means}} a pitch that is thrown near the batter's face. [...] The pitcher's intent may be to cause the batter to move [...] "back" [...] such {{that it is more}} difficult to hit a future outside pitch, to frighten the <b>batter</b> <b>into</b> a poorer batting approach, to intimidate opposing batters, or to actually hit the batter with the pitch. [...] If the umpire suspects the pitcher of either of the latter two intentions, he may eject the pitcher immediately or warn both teams that any similar pitch will result in automatic ejection. The pitcher's manager may also be ejected or warned if the umpire believes the manager ordered the beanball.|$|E

The frying-pan was used as a basin, and in this he made a sort of batter of eggs and flour. By the time he had done this four of the grouse were nearly roasted.

50|$|Prior to the 19th century, the English Christmas pudding was boiled in a pudding cloth, {{and often}} {{represented}} as round.

50|$|As a spekkoek {{commonly}} {{has more}} than 18 layers, baking it requires patience and is a very labour-intensive process. The batter is mainly made of butter, flour and sugar with an approximate ratio of 1:1:2. Each layer is made by pouring {{a small amount of}} <b>batter</b> <b>into</b> a baking tin, which is then put into an oven and grilled from above until the layer has turned golden from the heat. The tin is then removed from the oven and the process repeated to build up the remaining layers. Dutch ovens with a charcoal fire on top of the lid are said to produce the best results, while electric ovens are superior to gas ovens as cakes bake much faster in the former.|$|E
5000|$|The changeup {{is thrown}} {{with the same}} arm action as a fastball, but at a lower speed due to the pitcher holding the ball in a special grip. Leo Mazzone states: [...] "When a pitcher throws his best fastball, he puts more in it; the changeup is such that one throws {{something}} other than his best fastball. By having this mindset, the pitch will have less velocity on it {{in addition to the}} change in grips. This difference from what is expected by the arm action and the velocity can confuse the <b>batter</b> <b>into</b> swinging the bat far too early and thus receiving a strike, or not swinging at all. Should a batter be fooled on the timing of the pitch and still make contact, it will cause a foul ball or the ball being put into play weakly, usually resulting in an out. In addition to the unexpectedly slow velocity, the changeup can also possess a significant amount of movement, which can bewilder the batter even further. The very best changeups utilize both deception and movement." ...|$|E
