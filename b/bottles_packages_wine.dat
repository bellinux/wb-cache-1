40|$|A new {{invention}} of wine closure is introduced. By means of this closure, a UHF RFID {{application for a}} <b>bottle</b> <b>packaged</b> <b>wine</b> product detection is realized. The application is realized by designing a tag based on a meander line dipole antenna, according {{to the shape of}} the new wine closure, so that the tag can be inserted into the closure with good radiation performance. Moreover, this is the first RFID tag using the meander line monopole antenna. The experiment shows that the <b>bottle</b> <b>packaged</b> <b>wine</b> product labeled by the tag can be detected at about 1. 5 m distance, which is much longer than previously reported on wine product detection.

40|$|The {{purchase}} of {{a bottle of wine}} is often a challenging decision for most consumers. The marketing of a wine 2 ̆ 7 s package, which consists of several interrelated cues (bottle shape, color, closure, and label design), interfaces with the key factors of the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s experience, knowledge of wines, self-confidence and the occasion at hand to form buying decisions. Some consumers know what they want and select a wine based on their experience or the wine 2 ̆ 7 s packaging cues. Other consumers examine a bottle 2 ̆ 7 s label to satisfy their information requirements. Using a self-administered questionnaire, this study evaluated the effect that the <b>wine</b> <b>packaging</b> has on the consumers 2 ̆ 7 decision to purchase. Results showed that respondents placed great significance on the overall label and <b>bottle</b> <b>packaging</b> and that <b>wine</b> labels were intimidating, with females more concerned about making a wine buying decision...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wines</b> after <b>packaging</b> may undergo {{microbial}} spoilage, {{especially by}} yeasts. The risk of such spoilage can be minimized by preventing microbial contamination during packaging operations. This thesis describes <b>wine</b> <b>packaging</b> operations {{and the quality}} management initiatives required to control microbial contamination during packaging. Control of microbiological quality during packaging needs to be implemented without compromising overall wine quality and its appeal to consumers. The need for rapid, convenient methods to examine yeasts in <b>packaged</b> <b>wine</b> and to assess the hygiene status of <b>wine</b> <b>packaging</b> equipment was identified. The commercially available MicroFoss assay, based on optical measurement of metabolic activity, was evaluated as a rapid method for detecting spoilage yeasts in <b>packaged</b> <b>wine.</b> The method was optimised to enable detection of low levels of yeasts (1 cfu/ 200 ml of wine), and eliminate interference from wine acidity. More than three hundred wine samples taken immediately after packaging in a large commercial winery were examined for yeasts by the optimized MicroFoss assay and the standard membrane plate culture method. The samples represented red and white wines taken over 15 months and exhibited yeast counts of 0 - 1 000 cfu/ 200 ml. The semi-automated Micro Foss assay reliably detected the presence of yeasts in the samples (correlation coefficient 0. 89 with standard method) and gave data within 40 hours. Studies using wines inoculated with pure cultures of specific spoilage yeasts (eg. Zygosaccharomyces bailii) revealed a limitation of MicroFoss in detecting slow growing yeasts. The Biotrace ATP-bioluminescence assay was evaluated as a rapid, convenient method to asses the efficacy of cleaning and sanitation of <b>wine</b> <b>packaging</b> equipment. Approximately 900 samples were examined and met pre-determined assay units {{as a measure of}} hygiene status. Data on surface cleanliness were obtained within two minutes. In some samples, residues of biocidal cleaning agents interfered with the assay, giving false positive data...|$|R
40|$|It {{is quite}} {{difficult}} {{to highlight the}} importance of cooperatives as {{it is difficult to}} imagine their future, but if we take into consideration for example the wine sector in Italy and in France, we are forced to notice that the cooperative lobby is responsible for more than 50 % of the production in both countries. The objective of this paper is to describe what is determining the huge performances differences between healthy cooperatives and cooperatives with some pathological problems. Is it depending on their size? On the way they are managed or their nationality? On how or whether they innovate or not? Is it depending on other factors? We have been interviewing 25 wine cooperatives on their organisation and management in Italy (specifically in Umbria, a region in the centre of Italy), and in France (in particular in the Languedoc-Roussillon, a region in southern France). The collected data have been processed through a multivariate analysis (using SPSS. 15 software) to find links between organizational and structural variables, management approaches and performance indicators. Our results show that the main discriminating factor within both French and Italian cooperatives is the commercial strategy: either they traditionally sell in bulk and seem to face difficulties, or they sell consumer <b>packaged</b> <b>wine</b> (<b>bottles,</b> bag in box), become market oriented and can hope for better performances. Some questions, however, remain: is there such a dichotomy in between ‘product’ and ‘market oriented’ cooperatives, or does it exist an expanding continuum from un-differentiated bulk, specialised bulk, under contract specifications supply of bulk or <b>packaged</b> <b>wine</b> (Buyer’s Own Brand), <b>packaged</b> <b>wine</b> under a private brand? Is this path useful to develop more added value at production level systematically leading to better cooperatives performances, and for whom...|$|R
