Failures have also helped to gain better insight into the potential feasibility of techniques that had been considered in the objectives of this project. Endogeic earthworms (#Pontoscolex corethrurus$) may be produced in large quantities, i. e. about 12000 worms (1. 6 - 2. 8 kg live wt) /m 2 /year in specific culture beds using either sawdust (Yurimaguas, Peru) or a mixture of high and low quality materials (Tamil Nadu, India) mixed into soil as substrates.

The theorical value of an active earthworm community with an average biomass of 400 kg live wt has been estimated at 1400 Euro, the price that it would cost to reintroduce an equivalent biomass produced in our culture units, indicating the cost of land restoration. Direct inoculation of earthworms in the field to improve production may only affect plant growth positively if a large biomass (greater than 30 g live wt/m 2) is inoculated from the beginning.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{effect of}} raised <b>bed</b> <b>culture</b> on winter {{survival}} of ten pea genotypes (Pisum sativum L.), differing in inherent cold hardiness and growth habit, was studied under two climatic conditions: a moist semi-maritime winter (Corvallis, Oregon) {{and a cold}} continental winter (Weston, Oregon). An assessment of winter injury was based on three indices: percent survival, plant weight, and a visually assigned damage rating. Varying percentages of seven genotypes survived at Corvallis and of six at Weston. Planting on raised beds at Corvallis significantly increased the mean percent survival and plant weight and decreased the mean damage rating. Of two Corvallis planting dates, September 18 and October 10, 1975, the latter had a significantly higher mean percent survival and a lower mean damage rating. At Weston, the mean percent survival was higher on ground level plantings. Plant weight was not affected by planting method. At this location {{there was a significant}} interaction between planting method and genotype. Of the six surviving genotypes only the two least hardy had significantly higher percent survival on ground level plantings. Controlled freezing tests between - 2 and - 10 ° C were conducted on four genotypes, AW, WH 2, INTl, and S 4, to determine their relative levels of inherent cold hardiness and cold acclimating ability. An electrolyte leaching method of determining the extent of freezing injury ranked the genotypes as follows, from most hardy to least: AW = WH 2 > INTl > S 4. A visual estimation of damage ranked the genotypes as follows: WH 2 > AW > INTl > S 4. In comparison, percent survival in the field studies ranked the four genotypes: AW > WH 2 > INT 1 > S 4.

40|$|Mussel {{bottom culture}} is an {{extensive}} type of aquaculture; {{it depends on}} natural resources for feed, seed and space. It consists of the translocation of seed from natural <b>beds</b> to designed <b>culture</b> areas, where mussel farmers try to improve production efficiency. Production efficiency {{is measured by the}} relative biomass production (RBP) expressed as units of biomass harvested from one unit of biomass seeded, it increases with mussel growth and decreases with mussel mortality. Mussel bottom culture makes use of nature and also depends on nature. Cultured mussels are subject to similar environmental factors that influence growth and mortality on natural mussel beds, with additional effects of anthropogenic factors. In this thesis we focus on dynamics of mussel beds and the impact and effectivity of culture activities on mussel production yield. The major objectives are stated as: (1) to better understand the population dynamics of subtidal mussel populations, (2) to analyze what factors determine production efficiency in mussel bottom culture and how this can be improved. On natural mussel beds mussels organise in patterns that enhance food delivery and resilience of the <b>bed.</b> On <b>culture</b> plots mussels are seeded in concentric seeding patterns. Seeding techniques concentrate mussels locally within the culture plot area, resulting in high local mussel densities; this increases competition and limits the spatial re-organisation of mussels in the bed. Consequently, seeding on culture plots is followed by a large size and density dependent seeding loss that ranges from about 40 % for seed from fishery to 69 % for smaller SMC seed. This loss was the major factor in determining the maximum RBP. Losses in the grow-out stage were substantially lower, a subsequent density dependent loss was found for smaller mussels ( 30 mm). Shore crab predation is an important factor contributing to the higher losses at seeding. The effect of shore crab predation on mussel biomass production is higher than expected from previous studies. In an experiment on an intertidal culture plot in the Oosterschelde (NL), we observed that shore crab predation peaks directly after seeding and accounted for 33 % of the total losses within five weeks after seeding. Spatial patterns in the survival rates of natural mussel beds in the Wadden Sea show better seed survival in areas with intermediate salinity (mean annual salinity 17. 5 - 22. 5 mg l- 1). This suggests that mussel survival is negatively related to sea star distribution, which is largely controlled by salinity. Natural beds that escape predation are found at lower salinities and mussels on these beds showed low growth rates, also because of a lower food quality in these areas. Mussel culture strongly affects the population dynamics of the subtidal mussel population, through relaying of mussels from natural mussel <b>beds</b> to <b>culture</b> plots. Culture plots are located in more saline regions of the Wadden Sea (mean annual salinity 25. 8 mg l- 1), compared to natural mussel beds. This activity increased mussel growth and survival because food quality on culture plots is high and predation is prevented. As a result, average biomass production is higher on culture plots than on natural mussel beds and this difference increases over time. A more efficient seed use on the available area, that can be obtained by reducing seeding losses will increase RBP, maximum biomass production and increases maximum profit. Our results suggest that this can be achieved by seeding homogeneously in low densities...|$|R

40|$|Nine {{volatile}} hydrocarbons, {{as well as}} methyl chloride, {{carbonyl sulphide}} and carbon disulphide, have been identified by mass spectrometry as products of Agaricus bisporus in the compost used in commercial mushroom beds. Of these, only ethylene showed a pattern of production that could be correlated with developmental phases of the crop, high levels being produced whenever fruit bodies were rapidly enlarging. In laboratory flask cultures, under controlled conditions, high levels of ethylene occurred whenever young fruit bodies entered the expansion phase. The enhanced rate of ethylene production continued over several days, irrespective of whether fruit bodies were removed. Production occurred within the colonized compost; no ethylene was evolved by the fruit body itself. When the first fruit bodies expanded, either in <b>beds</b> or <b>culture</b> flasks, laccase levels in the compost fell and those of a P- 1, 4 -glucanase (cellulase) rose. The enzyme switch occurred once only, during maturation of the first fruit bodies, whereas an elevated ethylene production was associated with each occasion when fruit body maturation took place. The low level of laccase and high level of cellulase characterized {{the whole of the}} reproductive stage of A. bisporus, whereas the phasic periods of high ethylene production distinguished between periods of fruit body maturation and intervening resting periods...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to analyse genetically natural <b>beds</b> and <b>cultures</b> of the most commercially {{important}} mollusc of Santa Catarina (South Brazil), the brown mussel Perna perna. Two sites were chosen for sampling from natural beds and for settling experimental lines with seeds obtained from each local farm. Experimental lines were maintained during four months for evaluating the growth of mussels from different cultures. DNA was extracted by Chelex-Proteinase-k method from adductor muscle and amplified by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using PMS 1 microsatellite primers. Denatured 6 % polyacrylamide gel and silver staining were used for separation and visualisation of PCR products, respectively. The nuclear locus obtained showed {{no significant differences in}} allele frequencies between natural stocks. Cultured mussels in Penha did not differ genetically from natural beds, but Canto Grande culture was significantly different from the local stock. Mean sizes reached in experimental lines and also from individuals collected in natural stocks were found to be higher in Canto Grande than in Penha. Canto Grande samples showed departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the studied locus, due to heterozygote deficiency.

40|$|Elk Kelp, Pelagophycus porra, is {{commonly}} observed in deep (20 - 30 m) water along {{the outer edge}} of Giant Kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, beds in southern California, USA and northern Baja California, MEX, but rarely occurs in shallower water or within beds of M. pyrifera. Due to the nature of P. porra’s heteromorphic life history that alternates between a macroscopic diploid sporophyte and a microscopic haploid gametophyte, investigations of both life history stages were needed to understand P. porra’ apparent inability to encroach into Macrocystis beds along the southern California coast. Juvenile P. porra sporophytes were transplanted (1) within the Pelagophycus zone along the offshore edge of the M. pyrifera bed at 20 m, (2) within the center of the M. pyrifera bed at 15 m and (3) along the inshore edge of the M. pyrifera bed at 8 m. Transplanted P. porra exhibited similar growth across all depths, but the onset of reproductive maturity was observed only at shallower depths. Stipe length at the onset of maturity differed between depths, increasing significantly from inshore and within the center of M. pyrifera beds to offshore within naturally occurring P. porra beds. Photosynthetic measurements of P. porra blades using PAM fluorometry indicated that although P. porra initially exhibits characteristics of a low-light adapted species (20 m depth), individuals are able to photoacclimate to increasing light levels showing traits of high-light adapted species in the midwater zone and at the surface. When the presence of P. porra propagules was increased, P. porra was unable to recruit within M. pyrifera beds. No P. porra recruits were observed near sori bags placed within M. pyrifera beds while heavy recruitment (6. 5 ± 0. 604 SE and 2. 5 ± 0. 394 S E for 1 m and 2 m away from sori bag respectively) was observed near the sori bags within the P. porra bed. These seeding experiments indicated that a factor other than spore dispersal is limiting P. porra distribution to deeper depths. Culture experiments were carried out in the laboratory using microscopic gametophytes and embryonic sporophytes of P. porra to investigate the effects of the higher light levels found within M. pyrifera <b>beds.</b> <b>Cultures</b> were grown under low light (2 μmol photons m- 2 s- 1) conditions and then moved to high light conditions (16 μmol photons m- 2 s- 1) at which time both embryonic sporophytes and gametophytes experienced 100 % mortality. When grown under constantly higher (18 μmol photons m- 2 s 1) light conditions, the ability of P. porra to photoacclimate decreased. The vunerability of P. porra microscopic stages to higher irradiances appears to be the major limiting factor inhibiting P. porra from becoming established within Macrocystis beds and stresses the importance of a multiple life-history approach when investigating species distributions...|$|R

The biomass shows a peak on the third day due to the combined effects of microbial growth and decay. Another peak is evident for cases with a high initial concentration, possibly due to production of an intermediate metabolite. The pH generally decreased during biodegradation because of the production of organic acid. Two phenomenological models were designed to simulate the phenanthrene biodegradation and biomass growth. A relatively simple model that does not consider the intermediate metabolite and its inhibition of phenanthrene biodegradation cannot fit the observed data.

Mussel size and density of spatially segregated natural and cultured subtidal mussel populations in the western Wadden Sea were measured over time in 2 field studies. Spatial patterns in survival rates showed better spat survival in areas with lower salinity and lower density of sea stars Asterias rubens. This suggests that mussel survival is negatively related to sea star distribution which is to a large extent controlled by salinity.

Culture of native flat oyster, Ostrea puelchana (d'Orbigny, 1842), was particularly promising until an abnormal mortality occurred in 1996. Preliminary diagnosis, based on histology, revealed the presence of Bonamia-like cells in some individuals. In order to identify the pathological agent apparently involved in this mortality and to quantify its impact on natural beds, 42 batches of 30 individuals were sampled on natural <b>beds</b> and <b>culture</b> areas between years 1996 and 2001. Samples were analyzed by traditional techniques including heart imprints and histology, complemented by PCR and in situ hybridization. Histology and heart imprints revealed the presence of Bonamia-like cells in connective tissue of O. puelchana, free or within haemocytes, mainly in gills, digestive gland, stomach, intestine and gonad. PCR and in situ hybridization confirmed the belonging of the parasite to the genus Bonamia. Cultivated oysters and close natural beds presented highest frequency of parasite detection (50 - 60 %) when mortality was maximal (October 1997). Subsequently, prevalence decreased slowly until 2000 and increased again from 6 % to 10 % between 2000 and 2001.

Instead, every tested MUC 1 preparation, even non-glycosylated synthetic 9 mer peptides, induced interferon gamma-producing CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T-cells that recognized glycosylated variants including tumor-associated MUC 1.

Three hydroponics systems were used as the main plots, i. e. elevated tray, ground lay <b>bed</b> and bag <b>culture</b> systems. The sub-plots were allocated to three different aggregate/medium components, i. e., sawdust, river sand and vermiculite. Throughout the production period, plants grown using river sand had the lowest plant height.

Factors affecting shoot and root production of R. pseudoacasia L. were investigated by comparing various growth regulators [α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and 6 -benzylaminopurine (BA) ] and culture media [Murashige and Skoog (MS) and WPM (woody plant medium) ] on in vitro conditions, also <b>culture</b> <b>beds</b> (sand, perlite, compost and cocopeat) with different ratios and extracts of brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum on ex vitro conditions. Both of BA and NAA were used at concentrations of 0, 0. 5, 1 and 1. 5 mg l- 1. Concentrations used from extracts of A. nodosum were 0, 1000, 2000 and 3000 mg l- 1. The optimum plant growth regulator (PGR) combination for maximal plant height, shoot number, node number, root number, root length, leaf number, fresh and dry weight on in vitro condition was 1 mg l- 1 NAA and 1 mg l- 1 BA in MS medium. The 1000 mg l- 1 of extracts of A. nodosum led to optimum plant height, node number, longest root, leaf number, dry weight, fresh weight.   The most appropriate plantlets survival on ex vitro condition was observed when the culture medium was a bed containing sand + perlite + compost with proportion of 1 : 1 : 1. About 75 % of the propagated plantlets and 90 % of the micropropagated plantlets were established successfully in acclimatization medium. Regenerated plantlets were morphologically identical with mother plants. Present study showed positive modifications in shoot proliferation, rate of rooting of stem and some morphological and physiological characters due to subjection of R. pseudoacasia L. to optimum treatments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Colorants {{produced}} by various Monascus sp. are well established in Asiatic foods. Industrial production of Monascus pigments involves expensive submerged culture fermentation. A less expensive alternative {{is the use}} of solid state fermentation. This study reports on color production by Monascus ruber ICMP 15220 in packed <b>bed</b> solid state <b>culture.</b> The fungus was grown in packed beds (0. 05 m in diameter and 0. 17 m in depth of substrate) of moistened rice. The bed of rice was continuously aerated by sparging with humidified air (95 – 97 % relative humidity). The effects of different aeration rates (0. 05 - 2. 0 L min- 1) and initial moisture level (45, 57. 5, 70 % (w/w)) in the substrate, on color production are reported. The packed bed solid state fermentations were carried out at a nominal temperature of 30 oC. A forced aeration rate of higher than 0. 5 L min- 1 reduced the production of the pigments and biomass as a consequence of water loss from the bed. Highest levels of pigments were obtained at forced aeration rates of between 0. 05 and 0. 2 L min- 1. Under these conditions, the pigment content reached ≥ 98 AU per g dry matter in the bed. An initial moisture level of 45 % (i. e. g water per 100 g wet substrate) resulted in very low production of pigments and biomass with final moisture content of 29. 6 %. An initial moisture level of 70 % gave the highest pigment production in the fermented dry solids and also the highest pigment productivity, which were 1, 415 AU per g dry matter and 101 AU per g dry matter per day, respectively. The results suggest that forced aeration rate and initial moisture level in the substrate have a strong influence on pigment production in solid sate fermentation of M. ruber.

40|$|Microbial denitrification, a {{frequently}} used and relatively inexpensive method of removing nitrate from wastewater, {{has been applied}} to the treatment of potable water supplies, on a limited scale, using packed bed reactors. However, two significant drawbacks exist in transferring wastewater denitrification technology to the treatment of domestic water supplies: (1) the water is intimately mixed with microbial cultures and (2) organic compounds must be supplied as an energy source to drive the denitrification reactions and residual organics can be a water quality problem. Process configurations used experimentally have included both packed beds and fluidized <b>beds.</b> Denitrifying microbial <b>cultures</b> have been supported on sand, ceramics, polymers, clay, alginate gel, and agar gel. Work with conventional support materials (sand, ceramics, polymers, clay) has been relatively straightforward in that the microbial cultures are grown on support surfaces and water containing nitrate is passed through the fixed or expanded/fluidized bed. Carbon and energy sources, nearly always organic compounds, are added to the water. Thus the problem outlined above - introduction of bacteria and organics - is characteristic of systems used to date. The current work utilizes microporous membranes to separate the water being treated from the microorganisms carrying out the denitrification reactions. Nitrate passes through the 0. 02 urn membrane pores by molecular diffusion. Water does not move through the pores and therefore contamination of the product water does not occur. Operation of microporous membrane systems can incorporate a biofilm on the reaction side of the membrane or utilize a suspended growth culture. Transport, and hence denitrification rates appear to be greater using suspended growth systems. In addition, suspended growth systems will have advantages in terms of minimization of biofouling of hollow fiber continuous flow units. Measured nitrate diffusivities through the membrane pores was 3. 5 x 10 - 6 cm 2 /s for biofilm systems and 5. 0 x 10 - 6 cm 2 /s for suspended growth systems. Nitrate flux is dependent on the concentration gradient. Potential fluxes for concentration differences of 20 mgIL are in the range of 10 g/m 2 -day...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Miniature rose (Rosa hybrida) {{are well}} {{known as one of}} the world’s most popular {{ornamental}} plants cultivated worldwide as potted and/or bed plants. Nowadays, more than 100 million pots of miniature roses are propagated by stem cutting in the commercial greenhouses of European countries such as Denmark and Germany. Some treatments such as application of plant growth regulators and suitable rooting medium could be required for accelerating root formation in rose cuttings. Using plant growth regulators like natural or synthetic auxin is a pre-requirement for the initiation of adventitious root in some stem cuttings and it has been reported that the division of the first initiator cells of root depends on internal or synthetic auxin. Methods of application of these chemicals and suitable concentration could be related to several factors, importantly the plant varieties, type of cuttings and the time of cutting preparation. Various kinds of media such as soil, peat moss, perlite and vermiculite are used as bed substrate according to required ratio. Rooting media must provide appropriate moisture and air ventilation for cuttings establishment, which highly affect the cuttings root formation. Appropriate procedure for using wastes materials as <b>culture</b> <b>bed,</b> especially those materials that produced locally, is main aim of some studies to find an alternative medium in ornamental pot plant production. In this regards, evaluation of agricultural wastes to be used to <b>culture</b> <b>bed</b> and introducing suitable materials could be considered. Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to determine the effects of two types of plant growth regulators and bed combinations on rooting percentage of semi-hardwood cuttings in miniature rose. Materials and Methods: In order to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of indolebutyric acid (IBA) and naphtaleneacetic acid (NAA), and two media with different composition on root formation of miniature rose stem cutting, this research was carried out as a factorial on the basis of randomized complete design (RCD) with three replications. Plant growth regulators including IBA at concentrations of 0, 1000, 2000 and 3000 mgl- 1, concentrations of NAA at 0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 mgl- 1 were applied together with two types of rooting media. Media including mixing volume of perlite, tea waste compost and sand in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2, and perlite, peat and sand in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2 were mixed and applied in this experiment. Using SAS software, data was analyzed based on a generalized linear model (GLM) analysis and tested by least significant difference (LSD) at (P-value< 0. 05). Results and Discussion: Results showed that the highest rooting percentage of cuttings was obtained with 2000 mgl- 1 of IBA, while no significant effect of NAA treatment and different rooting media on percentage of rooting was revealed. The two-fold and three-fold interaction of treatments on other measured traits such as primary and secondary root number and root diameter were significant. The two-fold interaction of NAA treatments and rooting media on the trait of primary root number were no significant. The highest root number and root diameter measured in medium containing perlite, tea waste compost and sand in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2 for cutting received combined plant growth regulators. Conclusions: Compost, the final product of organic residues degradation, improves soil physical characteristics such as soil aggregate formation and stability, water penetration, porosity, compressing resistance and nutrients availability. As well, it improves soil biological characteristics and in result, integration of compost with soil can increase growth, yield and quality of crop. There are also some evidences that in contrast of peat, compost contains plant growth regulators improved plant growth and development. Totally, considering our obtained results, in order to accelerate rooting formation in miniature rose cuttings, treatment of cuttings with synthetic plant growth regulators in medium containing perlite: tea wastes compost: sand (2 : 2 : 1) under alternate mist system is recommended. Organic materials activate root area as well as improving fertility of soil. They also play a role in supplying and releasing absorbable nutrients, root establishment, enhancing field capacity, reducing evaporation from soil surface and reducing expenses. Therefore, we emphasize on appropriate using of these components in order to obtain better productivity...|$|R
40|$|We are {{continuing}} our investigations on Hokkaido. Up {{to the present}} date, we have investigated 31, 691 school children and 309 ambulatory patients with ringworm as indicated {{at the beginning of}} this report. - During our investigations we have obtained 157 cultures of a new species, which is found all over Hokkaido except in the eastern region. As an interesting result of our research, we have an entirely new set of figures on house cats which indicates the presence of a new epidemic. Parallel to our investigation on school children, we conducted an investigation in regards to their pets. As a result, and by the statements of the school children it has been revealled that the figures of "Cats with localized alopecia' comes to 106 / 321. We have discovered, as a fact, that on <b>culture</b> <b>beds</b> the material obtained, from a large number of investigated cats, 'contains the same fungi species. The deseased localities of cats are mainly on the facial parts especially the ear flaps, outer top sides of the eyes lids, and from the forhead to the parietal part. Besides the above, deseased areas may be seen on the outer sides of the forlegs, knees and on the back parts. On the mottled and deseased spots where the bristles have become detatched, a mixture of down like fur and bran-like squarma may be observed and at times squamous surface is bared. From these parts, as in the cases of deseased persons, it is possible to pluck deseased hairs with spore-sheaths. Thus we have discovered evidence of an epidemic among cats by this fungi, and also have been able to inoculate cats in our laboratory. It is notable that cats are more readily inoculated than any other animals. Moreover, mycologically it has all the qualifications of microsporun d'organe animale. In other words, we have noted that in both children (Adults are also susceptible; note additional report) and cats a close similarity in regards to the findings, also we have proved the presence of the same etiology, and we have reason to suspect the presence of a. 3 way exchange, between children, among cats, and between childen and cats. To this date no reports have been made in Japan concerning a ringworm epidemic from microsporun of animal origin. Previously, in documents a few confined cases have been reported. However such an interesting fact as ours has not been reported. Pondering the reason we arrive at the conclusion that, with the exception of Takahashi, the said fungi species have not been reported from any other locality or land. More tnan probably this particular species has existed in its present north-most end of Japan and its neighbouring localities, Takatsuki's stub was discovered at Odomari, Saghalien. Takahashi's stub, in this original report states "ditch digger in Karifuto," Hokkaido. However according to a statement by Komuro who cultured 'Takahashi's stub, it was a Korean ditch digger (Doko) called Yamashita. It can easily be imagined that the said laborer had moved from one project to another as is the nature of the "Doko". Thus it would be difficult to pin its origin to Karifuto. However by the date of the disease the locality in which it had been contracted could have been either Hokkaido or Saghalien. At the beginning of the discovery of this epidemic, with the possibility of its emigration from Saghalien in mind, we centered our investigation on Saghalien repatriates. Especially in the case of T. school in Sapporo where half or more of the children are repatriates, we made a concentrated research on repatiate children, comparative percentage between repatriates of infection comparative percentage of presence of said fungi, date of repatriation and date of infection. However we regret to say we were unable to obtain any reasonable data to prove the migration of our species. We must reconsider this later, after the area around Wakkanai and north most points closest to Saghalien have been investigated. We should also include a report in regard to the correlativity with the Ainu (aborigines of Hokkaido) but no data is available. In conclusion we suspect that our species have a parasitifer prior to its attachment to the cat. Also there is a suspiscion that this fungi could possibly, have been originated in a certain species of wild animal and by importation to cats relayed to man. However we can not make a judgement on this subject as yet. Though mycologically, our results are more or less the same as that of Takahashi and Takatsuki, we find that the details concerning the said fungi, after our numerous encounters and experiences with it in this epidemic, do not coincide in certain aspects. Especially by the various organs originating in this species, we have data by which we could possibly make statements concerning the nature of nodular organs and comb-like organs. However we prefer to conclude our report by merely classifying Microsporon Sapporense as follows...|$|R
