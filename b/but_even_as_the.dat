5|$|Wickersham {{estimated}} 500 {{people in}} town, and another count estimated 1,000, with 387 houses under construction, six saloons, and no churches. Before spring arrived, Wickersham published the first {{newspaper in the}} settlement—the Fairbanks Miner—on a typewriter. It sold seven copies at $5 per copy. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> walls of Wickersham's courthouse were going up, dissatisfied miners were leaving the area. Hundreds left on rafts going downriver or steamers going to Dawson City. By June 1903, cabins on city lots were selling {{for as little as}} $10. Meanwhile, Barnette sold two-thirds of his store to the Alaska Commercial Company and arranged {{for the establishment of a}} post office at his settlement.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> nursery resiting {{issue was}} resolved, funding {{problems}} delayed {{construction on the}} station. Despite the funding troubles, Metro planned to seek contractors in March 1982 for a $60 million contract to tunnel under the Anacostia River, a $60 million contract to build the Anacostia station, and a $100 million contract to build the Navy Yard Station.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, the sweeter Rosé d'Anjou was {{the most}} {{prominent}} Rosé <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> trend of consumers moving to more drier versions of rosé, the AOC still produces an estimated 18 million bottles of wine a year. In addition to Groslet, Gamay and Malbec are also permitted varieties in the wine.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> he spoke, <b>the</b> giant had {{swooped down}} {{and in a}} moment they were in its grasp being lifted closer to its monstrous ugliness.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> Editha, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{last of the}} old woman's words {{ceased to}} echo in the narrow room, had risen to her feet. Her heavy cloak glided off her {{shoulders}} down upon the ground; her eyes, preternaturally large, glowing and full of awe, were now fixed upon the young man--her son.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> {{he spoke}} <b>the</b> impetuous Flambeau had run his boat ashore in the {{rattling}} reeds, and {{they stood in}} the long, quaint islet beside the odd and silent house.|$|R
25|$|These {{suggestions}} {{were followed}} in 1946–47, by similar calls by the Brotherhood, {{referring to the}} deterioration of the main portal and sacristy. In addition, there were references to deteriorating windows, falling stucco from the vaulted-ceiling and degradation of the skylight in the choir. <b>But,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> DGEMN interevened in 1947, the church's condition worsened the following year, with rainfall that invaded the church, and a broken pipe in the sacristy, that resulted in the rotting of the wood floors that had to be replaced.|$|E
25|$|The {{other two}} groups of protesters, however, {{maintained}} their positions for weeks to come. The art gallery closed {{for the duration of}} the occupation, probably more because of the spectacle of shabbily dressed homeless men juxtaposed against the opulent exhibits of high art than for any logistical reasons. The RCPU emphasized discipline among its members in order to win rather than alienate public sympathy, which was evident at the other two locations that remained open to the public. Chief Constable Colonel W. W. Foster attempted to persuade the men to leave, telling them that they had made their point and should now go home. Brodie responded that if they had homes, they would be in them, and invited the colonel to arrest them. They offered to submit to arrest peacefully, and continued to do so {{for the duration of the}} occupation. Foster refused, and instead sought to manage the situation rather than clog the local prison with 1000 demonstrators and giving them the publicity they sought. The attorney-general agreed with Colonel Foster that the strikers would likely vacate on their own in a matter of days. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> strike dragged on from days into weeks, the police stood by awaiting orders before proceeding with an eviction. Colonel Foster had earned a reputation for diplomacy with the unemployed during the 1935 strike, which he appeared to be cultivating again in 1938. Behind the scenes, however, Foster was plotting with politicians and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to evacuate the post office and art gallery.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the {{earliest}} red wines produced in such notable wine regions as Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne were [...] "rosé-style" [...] wines made from juice that had only brief periods of skin contact during winemaking. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> trend in these regions evolved towards more modern ideas of [...] "red wines", rosés still hold a prominent place in many of France's major wine regions. Today rosé is produced throughout France from the cooler climate rosé Champagnes and Loire Valley wines to the warm Mediterranean influence climates of Provence and the southern Rhone Valley.|$|E
6000|$|... "Guard! guard! Come here!" [...] roared <b>the</b> burgomaster, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> {{he spoke}} <b>the</b> {{door was closed}} and locked again, and the train moved off. Then {{of a sudden the}} Norwegian grabbed Dave by the shoulder.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> she uttered <b>the</b> {{words of}} cheer her own heart failed her, and she again {{gave way to}} {{uncontrollable}} grief, while her husband, dazed and motionless, sat gazing at {{the face of the}} dead.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> {{he growled}} <b>the</b> doctor had taken down a lantern from a hook, thrown on a huge, {{battered}} fur coat that doubled his size, and was putting medicines--a very shopful it seemed--into a leather case.|$|R
2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 20th century, Irish {{dominance}} gradually {{yielded to}} a mixture of other nationalities, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood has seen growth in ethnic diversity today, the area still retains a strong Irish American presence, and there continue to be a number of Irish pubs and restaurants scattered across Woodside. After World War II, baby-boomers born in the area were primarily of Irish, Italian and Jewish extraction. Gradually, Dominicans and other nationalities began to make an appearance in the community, beginning in the late 1960s. A trend of diversity began then, and has continued since. [...] This diversity has been remarked upon by many observers and can be shown in residents' places of worship. For example, the Winfield Reformed Church began in 1880 as a Dutch Calvinist church and in 1969 became the first Taiwanese congregation in America. Others of Woodside's places of worship now include ones that are Hindu, Thai Buddhist, Romanian Orthodox, Filipino, Korean, Chinese, and Bahrainian. [...] Woodside has a strong Muslim community and is home of a large, multipurpose organization, the Islamic Institute of New York. [...] Among St. Sebastian Mass-goers, a priest reports that are about 45% are Hispanic (particularly from Colombia and Mexico), 25% Irish, 25% Filipino, and 5% Korean. In 1999, Woodsiders came from 49 countries and spoke 34 different languages.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> red sun peeped curiously {{over the}} horizon he was awakened by a most unusual disturbance--a {{succession}} of hoarse screams and a pounding of the air as from the quickly revolving blades of some huge windmill.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bravely done!" [...] she murmured, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{sound came}} from her lips the girl upon the bridge seemed in the {{exertion}} of the struggle to lose her balance. She threw out her arms, leaned sidewise, and then fell headlong into the chasm and disappeared from view.|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> {{she spoke}} <b>the</b> noise of wheels was heard. A wagon stopped before the door; {{there came a}} tugging and lifting, with a sound as of {{crunching}} gravel, and then a [...] "There!" [...] of great relief.|$|R
60|$|Presently I {{turned and}} frankly met his gaze. I had startled {{him out of}} his {{habitual}} set taciturnity, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> I looked <b>the</b> light that might have been amaze and joy faded out of his face, leaving it the same old mask.|$|R
6000|$|The lama {{lowered his}} voice. 'And I come here alone. For five--seven--eighteen--forty {{years it was}} in my mind that the Old Law was not well followed; being overlaid, as thou knowest, with devildom, charms, and idolatry. <b>Even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> child outside said <b>but</b> now. Ay, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> child said, with but-parasti.' ...|$|R
60|$|With the {{recollection}} of Miss Procter {{as a mere}} child and as a woman, fresh upon me, it is natural that I should linger {{on my way to}} the close of this brief record, avoiding its end. <b>But,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> close came upon her, so must it come here.|$|E
6000|$|Berenger {{felt as if}} {{they would}} choke him in his present turbid state of resentful uncertainty; <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> unhappy young King spoke, it was with a heavy, restless groan, as he added, 'If you know any lullaby that will give rest to a wretch tormented beyond bearing, let us have it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Then he said {{to himself}} that he could remain where he was in safety until the wind had subsided; <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> words were formed in his mind he was {{conscious}} of a weight upon his limbs as if something was bearing him down, {{and for the first time}} he realized that he was being rapidly buried alive.|$|E
50|$|Saran's father T. Kulandaivelayudam {{worked with}} the {{directorate}} of examinations {{and many of his}} relatives are teachers. He finished diploma in visual communications from the College of Arts And Crafts and became an instructor in textile designing. <b>But,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> a child, <b>the</b> only thing {{he wanted to do was}} direct films.|$|R
60|$|I {{followed}} her advice, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> I plied <b>the</b> spoon my thoughts were elsewhere. I was perplexed. It {{may have been}} the fact that I had recently been hobnobbing with so many bowed-down hearts that made this cheeriness of hers seem so bizarre, but bizarre was certainly what I found it.|$|R
60|$|<b>But,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> she spoke, <b>the</b> words {{sounded in}} her own ears strange and unnatural, and more like the {{chirping}} of a bird than the language of men. The hunter either did not hear her or {{he did not understand}} her, and the dog snarled and bared its wicked teeth as it sprang greedily upon the child-lark.|$|R
6000|$|He knocked resolutely at the door, {{then tried}} the latch. The door was locked: <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> young man {{hesitated for a}} moment {{wondering}} what he would do next, a firm step resounded on the floor {{on the other side of}} the partition and the next moment the door was opened from within, and a peremptory voice issued the usual challenge: ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{answered}} {{that she had}} some idea, but no more could pass till the meal was ended; when her father went into another room, and she followed him. The great grief {{broke out in the}} exclamation: 'I can't let him go;' <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> words were uttered, they were caught back, as it were, with--'God forbid I should stop him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Disturbed? God forbid!' said Lawford, but {{his dark}} eyes failed to move these lightest hazel. 'Well,' he {{continued}} nonchalantly, 'perhaps--perhaps it--WOULD be as well if Mrs Lawford should know that I am here. No, thank you, I won't come in. Please go and tell--' <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> maid turned to obey, Sheila herself appeared at the dining-room door in hat and veil.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have struck}} a reef!" [...] cried the first mate. [...] "We are done for now!" [...] <b>But,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> he spoke, <b>the</b> bark went on, over the reef and into {{what seemed to}} be a large harbor. Far in the {{distance}} could be seen a palm-fringed shore, with the waves dashing high up on the sands.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was in {{the crypt}} of St. Sava. It was all by accident. I was {{exploring}} all around the Castle, and I went there in my course. I found the winding stair in the rock behind the screen, and went down. Dear, I loved you well before that awful moment, <b>but</b> then, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> lantern fell tingling on the glass, my love multiplied itself, with pity as a factor." [...] She {{was silent for a}} few seconds. When she spoke, there was a new tone in her voice: ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> he spoke, <b>the</b> stout {{traveller}} {{picked him}} up by the collar, and dropped him like a puppy dog into Ulick's arms, just <b>as</b> <b>the</b> train was getting into motion; and a head protruded from every window to see the truant, who was pommelling Ulick in a violent fury, and roaring, 'Let me go; I will go to Gilbert!' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{sticks and}} stones were raised above {{him and the}} great fangs bared to tear him, there descended like a plummet from the trees above a {{diminutive}} figure with long, white whiskers and a wrinkled face. Square upon the body of Numa it alighted and there it danced and screamed and shrieked out its challenge against the bulls of Kerchak.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> doctor spoke, {{there came}} a sudden clatter of horses' hoofs and a jingle of iron mail in the {{courtyard}} below. Then up spake the Prior and called upon one of the brethren that sat below the salt, and bade him look {{out of the window}} and see who was below, albeit he knew right well it could be none but Sir Richard.|$|E
6000|$|A {{freight train}} was puffing into the siding at the Payson station. Bridge {{could hear the}} {{complaining}} brakes a mile away. It {{would be easy to}} leave the town and his dangerous companions far behind him; <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> thought forced its way into his mind another obtruded itself to shoulder aside the first. It was recollection of the boy's words: [...] "Oh, Bridge, I don't want to leave you--ever." ...|$|E
60|$|Laramie gave a quick start. Presently Duane {{turned and}} frankly met his gaze. He had startled Laramie {{out of his}} {{habitual}} set taciturnity; <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> he looked <b>the</b> light {{that might have been}} amaze and joy faded out of his face, leaving it the same old mask. Still Duane had seen enough. Like a bloodhound he had a scent.|$|R
6000|$|Man. Aye--father! I {{have had}} those early visions, [...] And noble {{aspirations}} in my youth, [...] To {{make my own}} the mind of other men, [...] The enlightener of nations; and to rise [...] I knew not whither--it might be to fall; [...] <b>But</b> fall, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> mountain-cataract, [...] Which having leapt from its more dazzling height, [...] 110 [...] Even in the foaming strength of its abyss, [...] (Which casts up misty columns that become [...] Clouds raining from the re-ascended skies,)[157] [...] Lies low but mighty still.--But this is past, [...] My thoughts mistook themselves.|$|R
5000|$|Sporadic {{progress}} was made on several continents, where medical pioneers established formal nursing schools. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> late <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 1870s, [...] "women working in North American urban hospitals typically were untrained, working class, and accorded lowly status by both the medical profession they supported and society at large". Nursing had the same status in Great Britain and continental Europe before World War I.|$|R
