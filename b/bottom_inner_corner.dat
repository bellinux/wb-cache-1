40|$|Abstract. The wall {{thickness}} around an <b>inner</b> <b>corner</b> in 3 -stages formed cups with a flange was increased {{by means of}} conical punches in the 1 st and 2 nd stages. Since {{the strength of the}} formed cups is greatly improved by the increase in {{wall thickness}}, the weight of the formed products is reduced by an optimum distribution obtained from the increase in wall thickness. The increase in thickness around the <b>inner</b> <b>corner</b> is obtained by compressing the side wall and conical bottom of the cup in the 3 rd stage. As the punch angle increases, the increase in thickness at the <b>inner</b> <b>corner</b> becomes large. The amount of compression is expressed by a drawn volume after the 2 nd stage. A maximum 9 % increase in wall thickness around the <b>inner</b> <b>corner</b> was successfully obtained for the punch angle of 25 º...|$|R

50|$|The {{distance}} between the <b>inner</b> <b>corner</b> of the left eye and the <b>inner</b> <b>corner</b> of the right eye, is called intercanthal distance. In most people, the intercanthal distance {{is equal to the}} {{distance between}} the <b>inner</b> <b>corner</b> and the outer corner of each eye, that is, the width of the eye. The average interpupillary distance is 60-62 millimeters (mm), which corresponds to an intercanthal distance of approximately 30-31 mm. The situation, where intercanthal distance is intensely bigger than the width of the eye, is called telecanthus (tele= Greek τηλε = far, and Greek ακανθα = thorn). This can be an ethnic index or an indication for hypertelorism or hypotelorism, if it is combined with abnormal relation to the interpupillary distance (A D STEAS).|$|R

Equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) is one kind of severe plastic deformation method to make ultrafine-grained metals. The ECAP processes are simulated by finite element method (FEM) in this work. The effects of <b>inner</b> <b>corner</b> angle on strain distribution during the deformation process are numerically analyzed. The evolutions of effective strain on three points of different deformation are compared. The {{results show that the}} deformation becomes severe on each point when the <b>inner</b> <b>corner</b> angle is less than 90 o, which is different from the situation when the <b>inner</b> <b>corner</b> angle is equal to or greater than 90 o. The results are useful for improving the ECAP process to make the structure of metals homogenous. 1...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{agreement between}} measured and intended distance of Keraring (Mediphacos, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) intracorneal ring segments from the anterior and posterior corneal surfaces. Methods. Twenty-six Keraring ICRS implanted in 24 keratoconic eyes were examined. The {{distance from the}} Keraring apex to the anterior corneal surface and {{the distance from the}} inner and the outer corners to the posterior corneal surface were measured 3 months postoperatively using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Agreement between measured distance and intended distance was assessed by calculating the absolute differences and 95 % limits of agreement (95 % LoA). Results. The mean absolute difference was significantly lower (p< 0. 001) for the measurements taken at the <b>inner</b> <b>corner</b> (23. 54 ± 15. 90 [*]μm) than that for those taken at the apex (108. 92 ± 62. 72 [*]μm) and the outer corner (108. 35 ± 56. 99 [*]μm). The measurements taken at the <b>inner</b> <b>corner</b> were within ± 25 and ± 50 [*]μm of the intended distance in 15 / 26 (57. 7 %) and 24 / 26 (92. 3 %) cases, respectively, and showed the narrowest 95 % LoA with the intended distance (− 57. 61 to 55. 15 [*]μm).
