50|$|Green {{colouring}} {{is often}} used to colour mushy peas. It is typically achieved by adding the yellow and blue additives, Tartrazine (E102) and <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>FCF</b> (<b>E133),</b> which together produce the green effect. The use of artificial colours results in bright green mushy peas. Pure mushy peas, with no colouring, tend to form a more grey-green end product. Sodium bicarbonate (E500) is often added to soften the peas to enhance the colour and to inhibit fermentation during soaking, which reduces later flatulence in consuming said foods. The British Food Standards Agency, on 28 April 2008, asked for a voluntary ban on artificial food colourings and suggested that the ban would be practical by the end of 2009. This would mean that certain foods, including mushy peas, would need to be free of the additive, otherwise the item might be removed from sale. Mushy peas present a particular problem since there is no alternative to tartrazine that gives it the bright green colour. Without the colourant the dish would be murky grey. Ministers have stated that they will pursue a ban through law if food manufacturers do not phase out the food colourings.|$|E

For an adequate interpretation of stained flow pathways, the sorption characteristics of the dye need to be better understood. In this study, we investigate the suitability of <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>FCF</b> as a dye tracer in vadose zone hydrology. The objectives were to test the effect of aqueous solution chemistry on dye absorption spectra, and to evaluate the effect of ionic strength and type of cations on dye sorption to soils. Batch sorption studies were conducted with three different soils and different ionic strengths of the background solution. Ionic strength was adjusted with either CaCl or KCl.

CHA 0 was present at 10 (sup 8) CFU/g in the surface soil, and 10 (sup 6) to 10 (sup 7) CFU/g of CHA 0 was detected along macropores between 10 and 150 cm deep.

Our results show that storage was larger on the tilled and compacted plot than on the non-tilled one. After tillage, transport processes above the plough pan were partly disconnected from those underneath because macropores were disrupted and buried by the tillage operation. However, preferential flow along cracks occurred on both plots and the macropores buried below the tillage pan still functioned as preferential flow paths. Therefore, we conclude that the studied soil is susceptible to deep vertical solute propagation at dry conditions when cracks are open, irrespective of tillage and compaction.

High-resolution spatial maps of <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> concentration were derived from the scanned photographs using one single calibration relationship between <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> concentration and the color spectra for all plots and depths. No significant or consistent directional dependence was observed in the spatial correlation structure of the dye concentration for the horizontal cross sections.

Disturbed soil samples were taken at 15 locations for each cross section and analyzed for Br-. Although <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> was retarded in the soil matrix with respect to Br-, both tracer concentrations showed an exponential decay with depth because of preferential flow enhanced by plowing. Only {{a small fraction of}} the dye was subjected to fast transport. The plot-scale information of the dye distribution revealed that our 15 sampling locations at each depth sufficient to identify the averaged plot-scale transport behavior in the soil matrix, but failed to represent the conducting preferential flow pathways...|$|R
40|$|A liquid chromatography/tandem mass {{spectrometry}} (LC-MS/MS) method is developed to simultaneously determine 20 synthetic dyes (New Coccine, Indigo Carmine, Erythrosine, Tartrazine, Sunset Yellow FCF, Fast Green <b>FCF,</b> <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>FCF,</b> Allura Red AC, Amaranth, Dimethyl Yellow, Fast Garnet GBC, Para Red, Sudan I, Sudan II, Sudan III, Sudan IV, Sudan Orange G, Sudan Red 7 B, Sudan Red B, and Sudan Red G) in food samples. This method offers high sensitivity and selectivity through {{the selection of}} two fragment ion transitions under multiple reaction monitoring mode {{to satisfy the requirements}} of both quantitation and qualitation. Using LC-MS/MS, the newly developed extraction protocol used in this study is rapid and simple and does not require the use of solid-phase extraction cartridges. The linearities and recoveries of the method are observed at the concentration range of 0. 10 ‚Äì 200 ¬†Œºg/kg and more than 90 % for all dyes, respectively. The method has been successfully applied to screen 18 commercial chili powders and six commercial syrup-preserved fruits purchased from retail establishments in Taipei City. The results show that three legal food dyes, Tartrazine, and/or Sunset Yellow FCF, and/or New Coccine, are present in some syrup-preserved fruits. Amaranth, an illegal food dye in certain countries but declared illegal in Taiwan, is found in an imported syrup-preserved fruit...|$|R
40|$|Straw {{residues}} may be {{accumulated in}} isolated zones in the plough layer after mouldboard ploughing. This may limit straw decomposition because of limited nitrogen availability {{depending on the}} prevalent water flow pathways induced by tillage. In this study, we used the food dye <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>FCF</b> (Color Index 42090) to make visible the flow pathways in the plough layer of a loamy soil after incorporation of 10 tonne of dry mass ha(- 1), {{and to get a}} qualitative and quantitative interpretation of the small-scale flow behaviour. Approximately 1. 3 L of a 4 g L- 1 <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> solution was applied at a matric head of - 1 cm with an infiltrometer, equipped with a 25 cm-diameter disk. Horizontal cross-sections of 50 x 50 cm were photographed at 1. 5 to 3. 5 cm depth intervals. High-resolution spatial maps of <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> concentration were derived from the scanned photographs, using separate calibration relationships between the measured <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> concentrations and the color spectra and depth for the soil and the straw. Pronounced lateral dye movement was observed through the soil matrix owing to soil sorptivity. In cases of high sorptivity, the dye barely reached the depth of straw incorporation. Otherwise, enhanced preferential dye transport directed towards the incorporated straw was made visible and the stained water eventually ponded on the plough pan which induced lateral redistribution. Although the straw inclusions contributed to dye transport, they did not retain a substantial part of the applied dye mass, owing to the low density and surface area of straw. However, these inclusions may enhance the fast migration of potential pollutants such as nitrate or pesticides out of the tilled layer where much of the transformation occurs due to biological activity.

40|$|International audienceDye-tracer {{studies using}} the anionic dye <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>FCF</b> were {{conducted}} on a structured sandy loam soil (Typic Agrudalf). 25 mm of dye solution {{was applied to the}} surface of 11 1. 6 x 1. 6 m field plots, some of which had been subjected to conventional seed bed preparation (harrowing) while others had been rotovated to either 5 or 15 cm depth before sowing. The soil was excavated to about 160 cm depth one or two days after dye application. Flow patterns and structural features appearing on vertical or horizontal cross sections were examined and photographed. The flow patterns were digitized, and depth functions for the number of activated flow pathways and the degree of dye coverage were calculated. Dye was found below 100 cm depth on 26 out of 33 vertical cross sections made in conventionally tilled plots showing that preferential flow was a prevailing phenomenon. The depth-averaged number of stained flow pathways in the 25 - 100 cm layer was significantly smaller in a plot rotovated to 5 cm depth than in a conventionally tilled plot, both under relatively dry initial soil conditions and when the entire soil profiles were initially at field capacity. There were no examples of dye penetration below 25 cm depth one month after deep rotovation. Distinct horizontal structures in flow patterns appearing at 20 - 40 cm depth coupled with changes in flow domains indicated soil layering with abrupt changes in soil structure and hydraulic properties...|$|R
