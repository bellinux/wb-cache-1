30|$|The {{anchorage}} structure {{fails to}} form the active bearing as soon as possible. The key for the active control of the soft roadway support {{is to improve the}} residual strength of loose rocks to give full play to the active bearing capacity of the surrounding rocks. Mine pressure observation shows that the cable can achieve a pretension of 100  kN, while the bolt has a pretension force of 30 – 40  kN generally. Therefore, the shallow anchoring structure formed by bolt and surrounding rocks present insufficient active bearing capacity. Moreover, the cable support is generally lagged behind of heading end by certain distance. The anchoring structure formed by the <b>bolt,</b> <b>cable,</b> the surrounding rocks fail to control intense surrounding rock deformation due to the insufficient overall active bearing capacity at the initial stage of the excavation. Therefore, serious deformation of the surrounding rocks appears and calls for repeated maintenances.|$|E
40|$|Researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have {{developed}} several new tools for evaluating roof support performance. A miniature {{data acquisition system}} (MIDAS) was developed that can collect readings from up to 16 strain gauges at regular time intervals and store the readings for later retrieval. Three LED lights change from green to yellow, then red, based on the reading levels and/or rates of change of rock movement. This feature {{can be used to}} warn miners of rock instabilities. The system can be used with any strain-gauged support (resin bolt, friction <b>bolt,</b> <b>cable</b> bolt) or with a newly developed rock strain strip (ROSS) developed by NIOSH to measure rock strain.

30|$|The {{combination}} of rock bolting and steel supports {{is commonly used}} in complex roadways. According to the construction sequence, this combination support {{can be divided into}} two types: one is installing <b>bolts</b> (or <b>cables)</b> first, then setting steel supports; another is setting steel supports first, then installing <b>bolts</b> (or <b>cables)</b> between the steel supports. <b>Bolts</b> and <b>cables</b> can be used with various steel supports, such as I-shaped steel supports, yieldable steel arches, and enclosed steel supports. <b>Bolts</b> or <b>cables</b> can individually be combined with steel supports (Tian et al. 2011), <b>bolts</b> and <b>cables</b> can also be together used with steel supports.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} {{compares the}} shear behavior of fiber glass (FG) bolt, rock bolt (steel rebar <b>bolt)</b> and <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> for the bolt contribution to bolted concrete surface shear strength, and bolt failure mode. Two double shear apparatuses of different size {{were used for}} the study. The tensile strength, the shear strength and the deformation modulus of bolt control the shear behavior of a sheared bolted joint. Since the strength and deformation modulus of FG bolt, rock <b>bolt</b> and <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> obtained from uniaxial tensile tests are different, their shear behavior in reinforcing joints is accordingly different. Test results showed that the shear stiffness of FG bolted joints decreased gradually from the beginning to end, while the shear stiffness of joints reinforced by rock <b>bolt</b> and <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> decreased bi-linearly, which is clearly consistent with their tensile deformation modulus. The bolted joint shear stiffness was highly influenced by bolt pretension in the high stiffness stage for both rock <b>bolt</b> and <b>cable</b> <b>bolt,</b> but not in the low stiffness stage. The rock bolt contribution to joint shear strength standardised by the bolt tensile strength was the largest, followed by <b>cable</b> <b>bolts,</b> then FG bolts.

This paper provides an extensive database of laboratory pull-out test results and confirms the influence of the confining pressure and the embedment length on the pull-out response (rock <b>bolts</b> and <b>cable</b> <b>bolts).</b> It also highlights the sensitivity of the results to the operating conditions and to the behaviour of the sample as a whole, which cannot be neglected when the test results are used to assess the bolt-grout or the grout-rock interface...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>bolts</b> are {{sometimes}} used in low-seam coal mines {{to provide support}} in difficult ground conditions. This paper describes <b>cable</b> <b>bolting</b> solutions at two low-seam coal mines in similar ground conditions. Both mines used support systems incorporating <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> {{as part of the}} primary support system. Two original <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> based support systems as well as two modified systems are evaluated to estimate their ability to prevent large roof falls. One of the support systems incorporated passive <b>cable</b> <b>bolts,</b> while the other used pre-tensioned <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> The results and experience at the mines showed that the modified systems provided improved stability over the original support systems. The presence of the <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> is the most important contribution to stability against large roof falls, rather than the details of the support pattern. It was also found that a heavy steel channel can improve the safety of the system because of the 'sling' action it provides. Additionally, the analysis showed that fully-grouted rebar bolts load much earlier than the <b>cable</b> <b>bolts,</b> and pre-tensioning of the <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> can result in a more uniform distribution of loading in the roof.

40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>bolt</b> {{supports}} {{are widely}} used as ground support in underground hard rock and coal mines. During the last two decades, the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> technology has improved significantly and new types of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts,</b> new grouts and new installation methods and pumps have been introduced and successfully developed. The design of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> is currently attempted by empirical methods based on rockmass characterization. However, until such methods do {{not take into account}} all the important parameters affecting the mechanical behaviour of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> namely, the type of cable geometry, grout quality, stiffness of the host medium, the amount of confining pressure and the presence of end anchorage and pretension. This thesis deals with the numerical modelling of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> considering all of the above mentioned factors. To evaluate the shear bond stiffness of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts,</b> which simulate the interface between the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> and the rockmass, a new empirical model is developed. A database with data of pull-out tests is constructed. Empirical relations were derived between the shear bond stiffness and the variation of confining pressure, the modulus of elasticity of host medium and the water:cement ratio. The relations were derived for three types of cables (standard cable, nutcase cable and garford bulb cable). A new numerical model using the finite element method is developed for the numerical simulation of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> Together with the empirical model for shear bond stiffness, the numerical model computes the load distribution along the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> and thus can simulate fully grouted, partially grouted, end anchored and tensioned <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> The model is implemented in an existing finite element code (e-z tools). Parametric analyses are performed on the new model, and proved useful in the demonstration of the role of each design parameter. A new design methodology is proposed to evaluate the load distribution along the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt.</b> Two case studies are presented: a stope hanging-wall support by <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> in a hardrock mine and a tailgate secondary supports in a coal mine. A comparison with measurements in the field shows good agreement with computed forces...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{behavior}} of fully grouted, untensioned <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> and their application to the stabilization of underground openings are investigated. The study program undertaken involves field, laboratory and numerical studies which aim to improve {{understanding of the role}} of passive <b>cable</b> <b>bolting</b> in rock mass support. The higher residual load carrying capacity of the cable and the grout-aggregate mix is compared with that of the conventional grout (cement + water). Based on the variational approach, an analytical model has been developed to calculate the distribution of shear bond stress along the embedded length of a <b>cable</b> <b>bolt.</b> A parametric study is then undertaken to illustrate the support behavior of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> with different grout compositions. A special finite element for the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> was formulated and integrated into existing finite element code called MSAP 2 D, in order to allow the simulation of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> in underground excavations.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of encapsulated <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> in {{the rock}} mass has been studied {{in the past to}} determine the load transfer capacity and their ultimate tensile strength. Past studies were mostly based on pull-out tests because of the ability of pull-out tests to be conducted both in the laboratory and in the field. Thus, a number of experimental and analytical models are available to determine the load transfer capacity of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> mainly in pull-out conditions. On the other hand, studies on the shear performance of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> are limited and are mostly based on experimental studies, which do not accurately simulate the real shear performance of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> The shear behaviour of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> is significantly affected by pretension load, <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> surface profile type, ultimate tensile capacity, rock mass strength and cementitious grout or chemical resin properties. None of the past research studies investigated the shear behaviour of various types of fully grouted <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> with varied pretension loads subjected to shearing.

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> for ground support is increasing in underground coal mines worldwide. Currently, two methods of evaluating {{the performance of}} the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> are favoured: the short encapsulation pull test, and the shear test. The former method can be used both in the laboratory and in the field while the latter can be undertaken mainly in the laboratory. There are two methods of shear strength testing: single and double shear tests. This paper examines the double shear testing of several <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> currently marketed in Australia under various pre-tension stresses. Both plain and indented wire <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> were tested. It was found that the shear strength of the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> was a function of the wire geometry and initial pre-tension. Indented wire <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> were lower in shear strength than the plain wire <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> A mathematical model was proposed to evaluate the shear strength of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> using Fourier series and a linear relationship between shear and normal loads. The model coefficients were determined based on the experimental results. The findings from the mathematical modelling tallied well with the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|The {{trend in}} the mining {{industry}} {{over the past ten}} years has been to use higher capacity ground support systems. Much of the engineering design and development for these high capacity ground support systems has focussed on new, more effective, and stronger rock <b>bolts</b> and <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> However, higher (;apacity rock <b>bolts</b> or <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> are only part of the solution to ground support problems, and it is now apparent that a total systems solution is required which addresses such issues as: speed of installation; safety; cost; rib support as well as roof support; and, the interaction of different ground support products. This last factor has received very little attention in the past, and applies particularly to the interaction of bolts, mesh or straps, and, bearing plates. Bearing plates are a fundamental and integral part of any rock support system. The capacity of bearing plates should be matched to the capacity of the rock <b>bolts</b> or <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> that they are used with, and they should be designed not to damage other support systems such as mesh or straps.

40|$|Fully grouted <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> {{have been}} used in the mining {{industry}} for more than fifty years. However, failure of <b>cable</b> <b>bolting</b> systems still occurs in mine sites, as a result of insufficient load transfer between the rock mass and the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt.</b> Numerous research studies have been conducted to understand the load transfer mechanism of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> in the laboratory. However, there are many shortcomings in previous methods. This thesis aims to propose a new approach to study the load transfer mechanism of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> As part of this research, a modified Laboratory Short Encapsulation Pull Test (LSEPT) facility was developed. It was mainly composed of two parts, namely the embedment section and the anchor section. The influence of termination methods, borehole roughness and pre-confinement on the performance of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> was investigated. The results show that the pre-confinement has a significant effect on the performance of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> The load transfer behaviour of two types of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts,</b> the Superstrand <b>cable</b> and the MW 9 cable, was studied. The influence of different parameters including the cable surface geometry, borehole size and confining medium strength was evaluated. The results show that bond failure of Superstrand <b>cable</b> <b>bolting</b> systems always occurred at the cable/grout interface. However, for the MW 9 cable installed in a standard borehole, bond failure occurred at the grout/rock interface in the weak confining medium. An analytical model was used to study the load transfer behaviour of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> Experimental results were adopted to validate this model. It was found that the cable/grout interface undergoes different stages in a pull-out test and the non-uniform shear stress distribution is more apparent in long embedment length. The shear performance of the Stratabinder grout in the constant normal stress and constant normal stiffness conditions was also studied. The results reveal that the low normal stiffness has little impact on the performance of the grout. FLAC 2 D software package was used to simulate the axial behaviour of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> The calibration process of samples and the pull-out performance of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> were validated with experimental results. It was found that the modified surface geometry has an obvious influence on inducing more confining pressure in pull-out tests...|$|R

The maximum shearing load achieved for the plain strand cable was 1024 KN, while the indented cable peak load was 904 kN, before the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> strands began to individually snap, which lead to the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> break up into two pieces.

The strength of tendon can be carried out by tensile failure tests, while the load transfer strength is evaluated by pull and shear strength tests. Short Encapsulation Pull Testing (SEPT) is used to study of the load transfer capacities of tendons, and can be undertaken both in the laboratory and in situ.

Within this testing process, the impact of the design of the bearing plate was considered that was found to alter the failure mode of the modified <b>cable</b> <b>bolt.</b> Other factors are considered, including the influence of borehole diameter, cable surface geometry, and sample strength on the axial performance of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts...</b>|$|R
30|$|Roof bolting is {{the primary}} roof support system in US {{underground}} mines. Roof bolting usually consists two major processes: drilling and bolting. In the drilling process, a hole is drilled to the desired length into the mine roof at the required location. In the bolting process, bolts, either conventional <b>bolts,</b> <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> or resin roof bolts are inserted into the drilled hole for roof support. The fundamental problem of rock drilling is the breakage of fragments out of {{the face of a}} solid wall of rock (Teale 1965). The breakage of fragments generates particles of a wide size range out of the face of the rock surface.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{analyses}} {{the effectiveness}} of gateroad reinforcing by means of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> under weak rock conditions. In the worldwide mining industry the method of gateroad support reinforcement using <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> {{is considered to be}} effective. The experimental application of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> was performed in gateroad # 165 of the "Stepova" mine, Western Donbass, Ukraine, and required instrumental control of "support-rock mass" system conditions. Methods: Obtaining absolute displacement of "support-rock mass" system elements and extensometer anchors by means of levelling in order to improve the method of observation. Results: The peculiarities of geomechanical behaviour of rock mass in the roof of gateroads is investigated. It has been established that the application of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> allows for a reduction in the vertical convergence of the gateroad, both in front of and behind the longwall face. Practical implications: Advantages of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> instead of end-face support and props in case of a high advance rate of the longwall face are shown. Originality/value: 1. There are no regulations and state standards in regard to <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> installation parameters in the mines of Ukraine, consequently the usage of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> for gateroad maintenance required preliminary testing under geological conditions at the Western Donbass mines with soft enclosing rocks. 2. Combining levelling with observations using extensometers allowed for the detection of the rock layers' uniform sagging zone in the roof of the gateroad...|$|R
