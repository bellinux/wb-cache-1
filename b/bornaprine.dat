50|$|<b>Bornaprine</b> is {{currently}} available under {{the brand name}} Sormodrem in the following countries: Austria (Abbott Pharmaceuticals), Germany (Abbott), Italy (Teofarma Pharmaceuticals), and Turkey (Abbott). <b>Bornaprine</b> is normally administered in a tablet form, however a recent patent is investigating the effect of several anticholinergic drugs, including <b>bornaprine,</b> in transdermal patches. These patches are not currently {{available to the public}} market. <b>Bornaprine</b> is not currently on the market in the United States and its clinical trial status is unknown.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bornaprine</b> is an antimuscarinic {{agent that}} nonselectively antagonizes muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors, M1 and M2. <b>Bornaprine</b> {{has been characterized}} as a very potent anticholinergic medication and further clinical trials have indicated its effectiveness at treating parkinsonian tremors. <b>Bornaprine</b> also has a pa2 value (affinity of antagonist for receptor) of 7.27 Â± 0.21 indicating a high potency.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bornaprine</b> (Brand Name: Sormodrem) is a {{synthetic}} anticholinergic medication that is primarily {{used to treat}} Parkinson's disease. Additionally, <b>bornaprine</b> {{has been used to}} treat other disorders, including hyperhidrosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bornaprine</b> is {{successfully}} {{absorbed into}} the plasma of humans within 1-2 hours after an oral dose. Additional oral doses of <b>bornaprine</b> resulted in some accumulation in the plasma.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} {{anticholinergic}} drugs, <b>bornaprine</b> {{had been used}} to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. <b>Bornaprine</b> most effectively treats the tremors associated with Parkinson's and also helps bradykinesia, hypokinesia, and posture and facial expression.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Side Effects== Since <b>bornaprine</b> is {{a potent}} {{anticholinergic}} drug, it has a similar side effect profile to other anticholinergic drugs, including dry mouth and constipation. Additionally, when <b>bornaprine</b> was administered to patients with secondary parkinsonism, few patients reported transient confusion.|$|E
5000|$|... ==History== <b>Bornaprine</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1960 by the German scientist H Haas, {{under the name}} Kr 399. Additional tests revealed that <b>bornaprine</b> was significantly more effective than nicotine at antagonizing choline. Because of its anticholinergic effects, {{it was intended to}} help with the symptoms of Parkinson's. Early clinical trials with Parkinsonian patients (completed in Germany), showed that <b>bornaprine</b> was successful at treating many of the key side-effects of Parkinson's including akinesia, language, tremors, and psychological symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Sleep=== When {{administered}} to healthy humans, <b>bornaprine</b> suppressed {{the amount of}} REM sleep, suggesting that the M1 and M2 receptors are involved in sleep increase and REM latency. This also suggests that <b>bornaprine</b> {{may be able to}} be used as a sleep aid in the future.|$|E
50|$|Single oral {{doses of}} <b>bornaprine</b> were {{successfully}} excreted in urine and feces in rats, dogs, and humans. The following mean excretion rates were also reported during five days for urine and feces: rat 31 and 70%, dog 53 and 39%, and humans 78 and 4%. Excretion was notably prolonged and incomplete at {{five days in}} humans, indicating a longer half life and metabolism rate of <b>bornaprine</b> for humans. In human subjects, <b>bornaprine</b> has a half life of approximately 30 hours compared to 5 and 12 hour half lives in rats and dogs, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Hyperhidrosis {{occurs in}} acute phase of spinal cord injured {{patients}} and an effective oral treatment for hyperhidrosis {{has yet to}} be perfected. A recent study done with patients with medullary lesions found <b>bornaprine</b> to be very effective in decreasing the amount of sweating in patients with minimal side-effects. <b>Bornaprine</b> is now commonly prescribed for treating hyperhidrosis in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Toxicity== LD50 tests {{performed}} on rodents revealed that 26 mg/kg intravenously and 112 mg/kg subcutaneously administered amounts of <b>bornaprine</b> were toxic. Subcutaneous application resulted in ataxia, spastic paralysis, and convulsions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bornaprine</b> is an {{epimeric}} {{mixture of}} exo and endo esters, and its major metabolites {{have been identified}} and include: three isomers of monohydroxy-N-desthel-Sormodren, three isomers of monohydroxy-Sormodren and 5-hydroxyl. Each of these metabolites were hydroxylated at either C-5 or C-6 in the bicyclic ring. The activity of each of compounds has been studied extensively and 5-hydroxyl showed similar anticholinergic activity to the parent compound when tested in isolated rat atrium unlike other identified meatabolites.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>Bornaprine</b> on parkinsonian tremor was evaluated in a single-blind study of medium-term treatment. 25 patients {{were treated with}} rising doses of <b>Bornaprine</b> per os, one week at each dose-level. The dose at which <b>Bornaprine</b> was most effective was 8 mg daily and its action at this dose was mild but statistically significant. The drug was generally well tolerated in patients with idiopathic parkinsonism, but transient confusion developed in a few patients with secondary parkinsonism...|$|E
