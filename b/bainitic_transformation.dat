However, compared with the base steel, combined addition of Cr and Al has no significant effect on <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation</b> and properties. In Cr‐bearing steel, Al addition accelerates initial <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation,</b> but meanwhile reduces the final amount of <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation</b> due to the formation of a high‐temperature transformation product such as ferrite.

As the press hardening process poses a heavily multi-parameter dependent modeling challenge, we focus on three main branches which complement each other. We emphasise the combination of basic sharp interface and phase field models with pragmatically adapted multi phase field models and experimentally parametrized implementations of the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model. In the basic thermodynamic modeling part, we review fundamental aspects of displacive and diffusional-displacive transformations to predict dominant transformation morphologies. These results provide a link to multi-phase-field implementations which allow to simulate isothermal <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformations,</b> supported by available material data from thermodynamic databases.

In order to meet the requirements for steel applications, new multi-phase steels are being developed. The microstructure of these steels consists of a variety of different phases, which leads to superior material properties - a combination of high strength with good formability. For the development of such steels research is required to gain more insight into the underlying microstructure and the mechanisms by which it is formed.

Different to these aspects, the present work explores the effect of free surface on the stability of retained austenite. The first part is to employ FIB milling to create free surface around individual retained austenite grains. It was found that martensitic transformation took place automatically in the retained austenite grain when a free surface was introduced, without applying external stress. This {{is due to the}} fact that the martensite nucleation energy barrier can be lowered as the strain energy induced by martensitic transformation is largely lowered when the matrix constraints were removed. The second part investigates martensitic transformation in micron-sized pillars which were fabricated by FIB from individual retained austenite grains.

The effect of intercritical annealing temperature and isothermal <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation</b> (IBT) time at 465 C on mechanical properties and microstructure were determined. The best combination of strength and ductility was obtained for the lower intercritical annealing temperature of 750 °C for an isothermal <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation</b> time of 90 s at 465 °C. However, after intercritical annealing at a higher temperature of 797 °C, optimum mechanical properties were obtained for a shorter isothermal <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation</b> time of 60 s at 465 °C, likely due to the lower C content of the intercritical austenite bringing about faster transformation kinetics.

40|$|AbstractTo {{increase}} the fatigue limit of high-strength steels which typically fail from non-metallic inclusions {{it is necessary}} to modify the inclusions and/or the surrounding matrix. The goal must be a higher threshold for crack initiation and/or crack propagation. One possibility to reach this goal is to execute a thermal or thermomechanical treatment (TT and TMT). The present work discusses a series of such treatments that were applied to classical bainitic materials states. The different treatments consisted of shortened isothermal <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformations</b> as well as cyclic loading, either with constant or stepwise increasing load amplitude, which were applied at increased temperature in the range of dynamic strain ageing. The lifetime behaviour of the different material states was determined in bending fatigue tests. In order to describe and compare the different treatments it was necessary to evaluate the stress intensity factors arising at the critical inclusions. The results for cyclic loading yielding a lifetime of 107 cycles turned out to be in good agreement with the predictions using the stress intensity factor developed by Murakami. To consider different numbers of cycles to failure this calculation method was successfully extended and a modified stress intensity factor was defined. The same method was also used to test and evaluate specimens with artificial flaws. These showed the same behaviour as the specimens which failed from natural non-metallic inclusions...|$|R
40|$|The {{transformation}} strain {{associated with}} displacive phase transformations can be utilised to improve mechanical properties of structural components in steels. The {{advantages of the}} transformation plasticity can be fully utilised by allowing the transformation to occur {{under the influence of}} external stress or strain. In this thesis, mathematical models have been formulated to calculate the transformation strain and texture during martensitic and <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformations.</b> The models are able to deal with a variety of complexities including various starting austenite textures and different states of externally applied stress. A variant selection model has been proposed based on Patel and Cohen’s theory and the effect of variant selection on the transformation strain and texture has been discussed in detail. A new theory has been proposed to calculate the extent of variant selection. An attempt has been made to separate the effects of stress and strain on transformation plasticity and variant selection. It has been shown that Patel and Cohen’s plastic strain theory is more suitable than the elastic infinitesimal strain deformation model to calculate the interaction energies between crystallographic variants and external load. Using theoretical knowledge {{and with the help of}} a neural network model, new alloys have been prepared to be used as the welding filler metals to reduce the residual stress and to achieve higher toughness.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{determine}} the influence of isothermal <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation</b> temperature on a fraction of retained austenite for a new-developed C-Mn-Si-Al-Nb-Ti TRIP-type steel. Design/methodology/approach: The thermo-mechanical processing was realized in a multi-stage compression test by the use of the Gleeble 3800 thermomechanical simulator. The steel was subjected to six variants of processing with an isothermal <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation</b> temperature in a range from 250 to 500 °C. Identification of phase composition was achieved using microstructure observations and X-ray diffraction. To determine the fraction of retained austenite the Rietveld method was applied. Findings: The maximum fraction of retained austenite equal up to 16 % can be obtained for the temperatures of isothermal <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation</b> from 400 to 450 °C, while the maximum carbon content in the γ phase equal 1. 5 wt. % is present at the temperature of 350 °C. Below 350 °C due to high Ms temperature, the largest grains of retained austenite located in the ferritic matrix transform to marteniste. In a temperature range from 350 to 450 °C, the Msγ temperature has a negative value, stabilizing the retained austenite. Research limitations/implications: To determine in detail the influence of isothermal <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation</b> conditions on a fraction of retained austenite, the knowledge of the effect of isothermal holding time is also important.

40|$|Purpose: On {{the bases}} of {{fundamental}} research [1], on the silicon influence on the kinetics of phase transformation of undercooled austenite in model ferrous alloys with carbon of a weak background of other alloying elements, {{it was found that}} up to the Si content of 1 mass % the steel hardenability decreases. The time {{before the start of the}} ferrite precipitation decreases as well as the time before the start of the pearlite and bainite formation. On the other hand in model ferrous alloys with carbon of a strong background of other elements, also in the range to app. 1 Si %, the time before the start of the ferrite precipitation and bainite formation is insignificantly prolonged (hardenability increases minimally), while the location of the start of the pearlitic transformation remains practically the same. This observation, being a part of designing the ferrous alloys structure, can be successfully utilised, among others, in steels for working rolls for plates cold-rolling. Due to that in these expensive tools we are able to soften the influence of the structural notch, which is formed - at a certain depth - by the upper bainite layer, in steels without silicon additions. Design/methodology/approach: Dilatometric investigations were performed using a DT 1000 dilatometer of a French company Adamel. Findings: An addition of 1 mass % of silicon causes a gradual vanishing of the steel bainitisation, being the bainite slipping in ‘under pearlite’, due to which the austenite, at continuous cooling, will be at first transformed into pearlite, on its grain boundaries, and only later - inside grains - into bainite. Even if it is the upper bainite its location inside grains, within the pearlite envelope, is less dangerous for the crack resistance than its location on grain boundaries. Research limitations/implications: These observations can be utilized for steels in which the <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformations</b> are shifted in the direction of shorter times (e. g. in chromium - molybdenum steels). Especially when this is the upper bainite known for its low crack resistance.

40|$|In high-carbon, silicon-rich steels it is {{possible}} to obtain a very fine <b>bainitic</b> microstructure by <b>transformation</b> at low temperatures (200 [...] 300 °C). This microstructure consists of slender ferrite plates, with thicknesses of several tens of nm, in a matrix of retained austenite. Whereas strength is mainly provided by to the fine scale of the ferrite plates (stronger phase), ductility is mostly controlled by the retained austenite (softer phase). Further improvement in ductility is achieved by strain induced transformation of austenite to martensite, the so called TRIP effect. In order {{to take full advantage of}} this effect, the mechanical stability of the austenite, i. e., its capability to transform to martensite under strain, must not be too low nor excessively high. Two main aspects of the mechanical stability of the retained austenite, morphology and chemical composition, have been studied to determine the role that these play on the ductility behaviour of the bainitic steels studied. It is suggested that the chemical composition has the strongest effect on the ductility of these new high strength alloys.

It can be realized via the design of tailored mechanical properties, but it raises challenges from manufacturing and realization perspectives in tandem with this kind of design. It is well known that the mechanical properties of parts and components are determined by the chemical composition and microstructure of the materials of which the parts and components are made, and the microstructure of the deformed parts is further influenced by the forming process and its process parameters. In order to achieve the performance customization of hot stamped components and satisfactory realization of their desirable performance, the study on the relationship among microstructure and microstructural evolution, forming process and process parameters, the formability of the material and the mechanical and deformation behaviors of the generated design must thus be conducted; this has been well aware and recognized to be a non-trivial and tantalized issue in realization of performance customization. This is therefore chosen as the research focus in this PhD study. In the first stage of this research, the kinetic equation of martensitic transformation of boron steel 22 MnB 5 considering deformation parameters and the kinetic equations of <b>bainitic</b> and ferritic <b>transformations</b> taking into account the start temperature of phase transformation are established through the experimental and theoretical analysis of microstructural evolution. With these developed equations, the different phase fractions in the deformed parts can be controlled by configuration of forming process and process parameters. In the second stage, the relationship among phase fraction and grain size after microstructural evolution, forming process and process parameters, and the formability of the drawn cupped parts in deep drawing process at elevated temperature is analyzed and established. The improvement method of formability of boron steel is obtained accordingly, and the constraints on the microstructure of boron steel based on its formability at elevated temperature are established. From the application perspective, the wide application of the performance customized components in industries is limited by the design capability as the present design methodology is not fully suitable for the design of the parts and components with tailored mechanical properties. In the last stage, the efficiency of B-pillar crash simulation model used to establish the relationship between microstructure and mechanical properties of B-pillar is validated by the crash experiment, and the design methods of B-pillar with the tailored mechanical properties are thus proposed and implemented based on the established relationship.

Operational load presents very complicated complex of adhesive, abrasive, and mainly contact-fatigue affect, which leads to preferential wear and tear primarily in the point and stock rail area depending on many external factors (such as crosswise and lengthwise slip, actual geometry relation in contact with a real worn wheel profile and the like) in the final result. The possibility of continuous reprofiling of the worn segments is an essential requirement on the material applied. The selection of material analyses results presented herein refer to the surfacing technology proposal of progressive bainitic steel for railway crossings casting. This material, industrial termed as Lo 17 MnCrNiMo, is intended for the most load-carrying segments particularly. Its chemical composition together with heat treating leads to the comparison with the original alternative (already applied Lo 8 CrNiMo) to modification of phases represented and later-on higher yield value mechanical parameters, fracture and notch toughness. Development holder of this material and as well the surfacing technology is DT - Výhybkárna a strojírna, a. s, Prostějov company. Surfacing technology solved herein came from experimental verification of some filler material alternatives, while the common background was following: • overlay quality associated with original characteristics of the base material; • demanded quality of join without a degradation of overlays characteristics; • all without a need of pre-heat and after-heat of created overlays. This technology is so attractive primarily because of reducing the problematic heat-cycle requirements {{that are to be}} obeyed. From the results – the crucial zone of transition follows from line of joint to the surface travel area. In this zone direct contact between base material and surfacing metal – no interlayer. This situation present a direct source of weld joint harm in interpreted combinations, simultaneously the absence of interlayer can cause higher inner press on weld boundaries. The positive influence of repeated heating of following layers surfacing on HAZ, {{as well as on the}} inner shape (grain) of surfacing metal, does not take effect. Manual impact load testing results in austenitic material of Cr/Mn type, which is manually able to harden above its original hardness of base material – without a phase <b>transformation.</b> <b>Bainitic</b> surfacing metal of Cr/Ni/Mo type does not yield to dynamic hardening under load. Large amount of dispersion of hardening was identified in area under the surfacing lengthwise the created weld deposits. In coincidence with this “sensitivity” to implementation it is proper to think of automatic surfacing appliance. Automation brings the advantage of stabilized process with and thus also the quality performance, simultaneously there is the possibility for layer preservation by flux and the positive impact regime of surfacing layers cooling. On principal it is necessary to lean the development of contact-fatigue load, where outstanding impact rate of load occurs in addition, against two basic moments: 1. The increase of lifetime in a given regime of load requires an optimal drift into the range of high cycle fatigue, where the influence of fore fatigue process stadium is principally real, which is possible to put together with increase of yield point from the characteristic material impress point of view. 2. Practically running processes of cumulative microscopic deformation (ratcheting) pose claims on the development conditions of surface layers plasticity. That together with anaclastic behaviour of a material influences the circumstances of already initiated damage, i. e. safety in regard of a dynamic load.

This article aims to study the different microstructural changes taking place when nanostructured bainite is destabilized by austempering for times well in excess of that strictly necessary to end the transformation. Results indicate that while bainitic ferrite seems unaware of the extended heat treatment, retained austenite exhibits a more receptive behavior to itSpanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad Plan Nacional de I + D + I (2008 – 2011) for supporting their research under the project MAT 2010 - 15330 Peer reviewe...|$|E

The modification of transformation kinetics and the presence of transformation plasticity is shown in a first step. Furthermore, the effect of stress on the morphological modifications of the ferrite laths is illustrated. The role of the stress on these changes is analysed. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{different}} techniques {{available for}} the accurate measurement of lattice fringe spacings are discussed and their relative merit under different circumstances assessed. The relationship between the lattice fringe spacing and the lattice parameter is further examined for both uniform and chemically inhomogeneous material. The techniques described were also applied to an investigation of carbon segregation in residual austenite after the upper <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation</b> in two steels...|$|E
40|$|Two {{low carbon}} {{carbide-free}} bainitic steels (with and without Cr addition) were designed, and each steel was treated by {{two kinds of}} heat treatment procedure (austempering and continuous cooling). The effects of Cr addition on <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation,</b> microstructure, and properties of low carbon bainitic steels were investigated by dilatometry, metallography, X-ray diffraction, and a tensile test. The results show that Cr addition hinders the isothermal <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation,</b> and this effect is more significant at higher transformation temperatures. In addition, Cr addition increases the tensile strength and elongation simultaneously for austempering treatment at a lower temperature. However, when the austempering temperature is higher, the strength increases and the elongation obviously decreases by Cr addition, resulting in the decrease in the product of tensile strength and elongation. Meanwhile, the austempering temperature should be lower in Cr-added steel than that in Cr-free steel {{in order to obtain}} better comprehensive properties. Moreover, for the continuous cooling treatment in the present study, the product of tensile strength and elongation significantly decreases with Cr addition due to more amounts of martensite...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. After <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation,</b> the dislocations {{formed in}} {{deformed}} austenite remained to be pinned by the precipitates so that thermostability of the bainitic ferrite was improved. Coarsening of the precipitates accompanied by their distribution density change occurred during reheating. After long reheating, further precipitates nucleated in bainite. Dislocations inside laths {{getting rid of}} pinning of precipitates and their polygonization play the precursor {{to the evolution of}} microstructures, in which lath boundaries disappeared gradually...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{determine}} the influence of isothermal <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation</b> temperature on morphological features and a fraction of retained austenite in a new-developed thermo-mechanically processed C-Mn-Si-Al-Nb-Ti multiphase steel. Design/methodology/approach: The thermo-mechanical processing was realized in a multi-stage compression test by the use of the Gleeble thermomechanical simulator. The steel was isothermally held for 600 s in a <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation</b> temperature range of 250 to 500 °C. A fraction and stereological parameters of retained austenite were determined by a computer image analyser using an optical microscope. The details of the retained austenite morphology were revealed in a scanning electron microscope and using EBSD technique. Findings: The maximum fraction of retained austenite (above 14 %) was obtained for the temperatures of isothermal <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation</b> from 400 to 450 °C. Below 350 °C, the largest grains of retained austenite located in a ferritic matrix transform to martensite and its fraction estimated by the use of computer image analysis is too high compared to X-ray investigations. Blocky, irregular grains located in a ferritic matrix are a main structural constituent of retained austenite in a temperature range up to 350 °C. Increasing the isothermal holding temperature to a range of 400 - 450 °C results in increasing a fraction of fine blocky and layer regions of the γ phase. Research limitations/implications: To describe in detail morphological features of retained austenite in fine-grained multiphase structures, a combination of different methods characterized by various resolution is necessary. Practical implications: The revealed morphological features of retained austenite are of great importance for mechanical stability of this phase during cold straining, affecting mechanical properties of advanced TRIP-assisted steels. Originality/value: Combined colour etching, scanning electron microscopy and EBSD (Electron Backscattered Diffraction) methods were applied to characterize retained austenite in a modern group of thermomechanically processed TRIP steels with Nb and Ti microadditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{new class}} of {{bainitic}} steels can present toughness at room temperature greater than traditional quenched and tempered martensitic steel. This is because the microstructure of steel with high Si content (≈ 1. 5 wt%) submitted to <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation</b> is compose of fine plates of bainitic ferrite separated by retained austenite. The inhibition of cementite precipitation leads to the improvement of toughness. The presence of cementite facilitates the nucleation of cracks. Moreover, the blocks of retained austenite are undesirable. This morphology is rather unstable and tends to transform into hard and brittle untempered martensite {{under the influence of}} small stress, contributing to a low toughness. However, it was observed in this work that the greater the volume fraction of retained austenite, the greater is the toughness (10 - 24 J) for multi-phase steel. The values of toughness were independent whether the retained austenite is present on film or block forms. The decrease of toughness values was observed by the tempered samples after the <b>bainitic</b> <b>transformation</b> (10 - 14 J). This occurred because the blocks of retained austenite decomposed into carbides, martensite and/or bainite...|$|E
