The coastal plains and lower elevations are covered by evergreen laurel-Castanopsis forests, dominated by Cryptocarya chinensis and Castanopsis hystrix, with scattered stands of the subtropical pine Pinus massoniana. As elevation increases, the evergreen <b>broadleaf</b> <b>trees</b> are gradually replaced by deciduous <b>broadleaf</b> <b>trees</b> and conifers. At higher elevations, Cyclobalanopsis glauca replaces laurel and Castanopsis as the dominant tree.|$|R

50|$|A broad-leaved, broad-leaf, or <b>broadleaf</b> <b>tree</b> is any tree {{within the}} diverse botanical group of {{angiosperms}} which has flat leaves and produces seeds inside of fruits. It {{is one of}} two general types of trees; the other type is a conifer, a tree with needle-like or scale-like leaves and seeds borne in woody cones. Broad-leaved trees are sometimes known as hardwoods.|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between health condition and aesthetic value of green spaces was studied in Pionirski Park. Mean ratings of these values were compared and analyzed for different plant categories (<b>broadleaf</b> <b>trees,</b> coniferous <b>trees</b> <b>broadleaf</b> shrubs, evergreen shrubs and coniferous shrubs). It {{was concluded that}} in Pionirski Park <b>broadleaf</b> <b>trees</b> have higher aesthetic values than coniferous trees. Total aesthetic value of coniferous trees is {{lower than that of}} <b>broadleaf</b> <b>trees,</b> because the latter are infested by pests and diseases of assimilation organs, which have been present for many years in high degrees of infestation and infection. It was concluded that coniferous trees were significantly degraded thanks to inadequate maintenance, by which their aesthetic value was reduced and their life span significantly shortened. It is extremely important to research the current health condition of green spaces and to determine what reclamation measures are necessary to conserve and enhance its authenticity, cultural-landscape heritage and aesthetic value...|$|R

Most of this volume comes from clearfelling areas; an increasing percentage however is sourced from stands harvested under continuous cover silviculture systems. Clear felled areas are replanted {{with a mix}} of coniferous and <b>broadleaf</b> <b>tree</b> species, opportunities are also taken to increase the proportion of open space and to improved the riparian habitat.

50|$|Forest {{landscapes of}} the Urals are diverse, {{especially}} in the southern part. The western areas are dominated by dark coniferous taiga forests which change to mixed and deciduous forests in the south. The eastern mountain slopes have light coniferous taiga forests. The Northern Urals are dominated by conifers, namely Siberian fir, Siberian pine, Scots pine, Siberian spruce, Norway spruce and Siberian larch, {{as well as by}} silver and downy birches. The forests are much sparser in the Polar Urals. Whereas {{in other parts of the}} Ural Mountains they grow up to an altitude of 1000 m, in the Polar Urals the tree line is at 250-400 m. The polar forests are low and are mixed with swamps, lichens, bogs and shrubs. Dwarf birch, mosses and berries (blueberry, cloudberry, black crowberry, etc.) are abundant. The forests of the Southern Urals are the most diverse in composition: here, together with coniferous forests are also abundant <b>broadleaf</b> <b>tree</b> species such as English oak, Norway maple and elm. The Virgin Komi Forests in the northern Urals are recognized as a World Heritage site.|$|E
