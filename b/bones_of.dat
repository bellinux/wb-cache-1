5|$|Animal remains {{have been}} found in the wreck of the Mary Rose. These include the skeletons of a rat, a frog and a dog. The dog, a mongrel between {{eighteen}} months and two years in age, was found near the hatch to the ship's carpenter's cabin and is thought to have been brought aboard as a ratter. Nine barrels {{have been found}} to contain <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> cattle, indicating that they contained pieces of beef butchered and stored as ship's rations. In addition, the <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> pigs and fish, stored in baskets, have also been found.|$|E

5|$|Between 1815 and 1824, the Rev William Buckland, a {{professor}} of geology at Oxford, collected more fossilized <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> Megalosaurus {{and became the first}} person to describe a dinosaur in a scientific journal. The second dinosaur genus to be identified, Iguanodon, was discovered in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell– the wife of English geologist Gideon Mantell. Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between his fossils and the <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> modern iguanas. He published his findings in 1825.|$|E

5|$|The forelimb <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> azhdarchids and ornithocheirids were unusually long {{compared}} to other pterosaurs, and, in azhdarchids, the <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> the arm and hand (metacarpals) were particularly elongated. Furthermore, as a whole, azhdarchid front limbs were proportioned similarly to fast-running ungulate mammals. Their hind limbs, on the other hand, were not built for speed, but they were long compared with most pterosaurs, and allowed for a long stride length. While azhdarchid pterosaurs probably could not run, {{they would have been}} relatively fast and energy efficient.|$|E

5|$|The {{other major}} {{subfamily}} of tyrannosaurids is the Tyrannosaurinae, which includes Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. Compared with these robust tyrannosaurines, albertosaurines had slender builds, with proportionately smaller skulls and longer <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> the lower leg (tibia) and feet (metatarsals and phalanges).|$|E

5|$|The tail club of Ankylosaurus {{seems to}} have been an active {{defensive}} weapon, capable of producing enough of an impact to break the <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> an assailant. The tendons of the tail were partially ossified and were not very elastic, allowing great force to be transmitted to the club when it was used as a weapon. Coombs suggested in 1979 that several hindlimb muscles would have controlled the swinging of the tail, and that violent thrusts of the club {{would have been able to}} break the metatarsal <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> large theropods.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also brought}} out, {{for the first}} time, the burial customs of the Neolithic people. Both human and animal skeletons were found in deep oval shaped pits, located either below the floors of the {{dwelling}} units or in its precincts. These pits were filled with ash, stones and potsherds. Some of the human skulls found here had trepanning (bored hole) marks. In many pits, <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> dogs and antlered deer were found along with human skeletons. The skeletons of humans {{were found in the}} burial pits in a sitting position along with <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> animals.|$|E
5|$|Analysis {{of antiquities}} related to {{skeletal}} remains revealed 12 species of domesticated and wild animals: cattle, buffaloes (Bubalisbubalis linn), sheep (Ovis aries), cheetal (Axis axis), barasinga, pig, elephant, rhinoceros, cheetal (Axis axia), dog, a carp and {{two types of}} turtles. <b>Bones</b> <b>of</b> birds and fish were also found. Faunal finds indicate that the area was forested over an undulating topography.|$|E

What percentage these numbers are of the total dead or {{the percentage of the}} dead to the total number at risk remain completely unknown.|$|E
5|$|Christiansen (1998) {{estimated}} that the leg <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum speed would have been about , {{which is about the}} speed of a human sprinter. But he also noted that such estimates depend on many dubious assumptions.|$|E
