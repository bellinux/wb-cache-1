5000|$|Tuesday 3rd September. An {{air attack}} {{by a single}} Italian machine took place on Aden. I was A/A guard. The Italian {{aircraft}} are painted with a light sand under-colour, which at the very high level <b>bombing</b> <b>height</b> favoured (13 to 16,000 feet) merges very successfully into the usual hard bright sky. At times when near the sun, they have been extremely difficult to see.|$|E
50|$|There {{were few}} defences, so some crews {{attacked}} at 600 metres (2,000 feet) although the average <b>bombing</b> <b>height</b> {{was just over}} 10,000 feet. The attack took place in three waves, the first, which arrived over Lübeck at 23:18, consisting of experienced crews in aircraft fitted with Gee electronic navigation systems (Lübeck was beyond the range of Gee but it helped with preliminary navigation). The raid finished at 02:58 on Sunday morning. 191 crews claimed successful attacks.|$|E
50|$|McCarthy's {{plane was}} on its own when it arrived over the Sorpe Dam at 00:15 hours, and {{realised}} the approach was even more difficult than expected: the flight path led over a church steeple {{in the village of}} Langscheid, located on the hillcrest overlooking the dam. With only seconds to go before the bomber had to pull up, to avoid hitting the hillside {{at the other end of}} the dam, the bomb aimer George Johnson had no time to correct the <b>bomb's</b> <b>height</b> and heading.|$|R
50|$|Intelligence {{gathered}} {{after the}} attack proved that the <b>bombing</b> at the <b>height</b> chosen had been inaccurate and that the PLAN bases were unoccupied during the attack..|$|R
50|$|The single {{reconnaissance}} planes Ju-88 and Do-215 {{flew over}} the city from June 1 to 5 at different heights. June 23, Ju-88 from a great <b>height</b> <b>bombed</b> the Sokol plant, but the bombs fell into the Sormovskiy Park.|$|R
5000|$|Second Lieutenant (temporary Captain) L. A. Strange, The Dorsetshire Regiment and Royal Flying Corps.For gallantry {{and ability}} on {{reconnaissance}} and other duties on numerous occasions, {{especially on the}} occasion when he dropped three <b>bombs</b> from a <b>height</b> of only 200 feet on the railway junction at Courtrai; whilst being assailed by heavy rifle fire. London Gazette, 27 March 1915 ...|$|R
50|$|The {{first use}} of dive bombing by the Royal Flying Corps, which had been urging its pilots to drop <b>bombs</b> at <b>heights</b> below 500 ft in order to hit within 150 ft of the target since February 1915, was later that year. On 27 November 1915, Lieutenant Duncan Grinnell-Milne arrived in his Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c over railway {{marshalling}} yards near Lys in Northern France, to find the target already crowded by other bombers. He dived from 10000 ft to 2000 ft before releasing his 20 lb bombs. A few weeks later, Lieutenant Arthur Gould dived to just 100 ft to hit buildings near Arras.|$|R
2500|$|The type {{was used}} {{for a number of}} {{experiments}} by the Port Victoria Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot. On 9 May 1916, a Short 184 seaplane, using a bombsight developed by Bourdillon and Tizard, hit a target with a 500-pound <b>bomb</b> from a <b>height</b> of 4,000 feet. [...] The 184 was also used for trials of the Davis gun in April 1916 ...|$|R
50|$|Although the {{material}} and the processes were kept secret, the workers there knew they worked {{as part of the}} World War II efforts. They were led to believe that they worked on making conventional <b>bombs.</b> During the <b>height</b> of the production in 1942, there was a war production drive at the plant {{under the auspices of the}} labor-management committee to increase its production and warned workers against sabotage. The streets at the plant were renamed to MacArthur Avenue and MacArthur Plaza to promote patriotism.|$|R
50|$|At Los Alamos Penney {{worked on}} the use of the atomic <b>bomb,</b> {{particularly}} the <b>height</b> at which it should be detonated. He quickly gained recognition for his scientific talents, and also for his leadership qualities and ability to work in harmony with others. Within a few weeks of his arrival he was added to the core group of scientists making key decisions in the direction of the program. Other members of that team included J. Robert Oppenheimer, John von Neumann, Norman F. Ramsey and Captain William Parsons of the United States Navy (USN).|$|R
50|$|Intended {{primarily}} as a stop-gap defensive weapon for British merchant ships, which had been suffering heavy losses from Luftwaffe aircraft flying anti-shipping missions, the low altitude at which such strikes often took place (such as during torpedo attacks by Heinkel He 111's or skip-bombing attacks by Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor) meant that even a weapon of such limited range and velocity could throw up an effective screen of fire over a vessel, even if only to create a distracting or deterrent effect, obliging the enemy to <b>bomb</b> from greater <b>heights</b> which reduced <b>bombing</b> accuracy.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{use of the}} 184 was its use in anti-submarine patrol work. Although {{a substantial}} number of submarines were spotted and attacked, no confirmed sinkings were made. The type was used for a number of experiments by the Port Victoria Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot. On 9 May 1916, a Short 184 seaplane, using a bombsight developed by Bourdillon and Tizard, hit a target with a 500-pound <b>bomb</b> from a <b>height</b> of 4,000 feet.

5000|$|Distinguished Flying Cross Lieutenant Colin Peter Brown (Sea Patrol).Was {{engaged in}} a bombing raid on an enemy {{seaplane}} base by night, and dropped his <b>bombs</b> from a <b>height</b> of 500 feet, causing considerable destruction. Shortly afterwards he bombed an enemy aerodrome in daylight, also from a height of 500 feet, and then descended to 300 feet and destroyed an enemy machine. On arriving at his aerodrome fifty-nine bullet-holes were found in his machine. He has since then destroyed two enemy aeroplanes. Lieutenant Brown has been engaged in several other aerial fights, and has proved himself a gallant and resourceful flight leader.|$|R
50|$|General Raven (레이븐 장군): Originally a top ARC racer, he {{received}} a lifetime ban from racing after sabotaging competitor leading to a near fatal crash. As a Black Cloud leader, he attempts to take revenge against Captain Strong and the ARC. After failing to convince Fly-Girl and Crusher to manually detonate <b>bombs</b> at Soaring <b>Heights</b> following a delay on bomb timer set by Zak, Raven was persuaded by Viper to fight against Metajets at the front line. In a Soaring Height ground duel against Ace, Ace fired at an undetonated missile behind Raven, triggering an explosion that freezes Raven. Following the final ARC race of the season, the frozen Raven was seen in a jar maintained by Dr. Lucas.|$|R
50|$|Two-engine bombers of the squadrons KG-27 and KG-55 {{participated in}} the raids, which rose from the airfields near Orel and Bryansk and, {{bypassing}} the Moscow air defense zone, they flew up to Gorky from Dzerzhinsk, Bogorodsk and Arzamas. To use the darkest time of the day, bombardments were conducted from 12 am to 2 am. At first the target was designated as light missiles and air defense was blocked, then <b>bombed</b> from different <b>heights</b> and directions. Tactics changed every time. High-explosive, fragmentation and incendiary bombs of various calibers (up to 2000 kg) and incendiary liquids were dropped into the city. The results of each raid recorded by reconnaissance aircraft flying over the city {{at an altitude of}} 7 km, at 5 pm the next day.|$|R
5000|$|... "For {{conspicuous}} gallantry {{and devotion}} to duty. While on patrol work {{he and his}} patrol attacked two enemy two-seater machines, {{one of which was}} driven down out of control, the other being seriously damaged. On the following day he attacked a hostile reconnaissance machine, which he forced to land in our lines. On a later occasion he volunteered to attack a hostile aerodrome in foggy weather. He dropped four <b>bombs</b> from a <b>height</b> of 200 feet which blew in the sides of one of the hangars, and then attacked horse and motor transport on the road, finally engaging enemy troops in the main street of a village with machine-gun fire. He has shown great skill and daring as a leader of offensive patrols." ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 19/20 March 1940 Staton led {{an attack on the}} {{seaplane}} base at Hörnum, on the island of Sylt, his being the first aircraft to drop bombs on German soil. This was in retaliation for a German air raid on the naval base at Scapa Flow on 16 March in which four sailors and one civilian were killed, and seven wounded. Previous to this both the British and Germans had refrained from bombing land targets. Staton led seven Whitleys from No. 10 Squadron, as part of a force of thirty Whitleys and twenty Hampdens from Bomber Command's No. 4 and No. 5 Groups. Only 29 Whitleys and 17 Hampdens reached the target; three having turned back with mechanical problems, and one failing to locate the target. The aircraft dropped forty , eighty-four , and 1,260 incendiary <b>bombs</b> from <b>heights</b> ranging from [...] to , but mostly from around , over a period of six hours. One Whitley was lost to enemy flak, and two others slightly damaged. Despite claims of severe damage being inflicted, later photo-reconnaissance showed only minor damage to the base and its installations. On 7 June Staton received a bar to his Distinguished Service Order in recognition of his [...] "outstanding gallantry and leadership in recent air operations", awarded primarily for his part on an attack on an oil depot in Bremen, which he attacked at low level, despite his aircraft having been hit by six shells and badly damaged.|$|R
5000|$|... 16 May 1944: During a {{long-range}} reconnaissance flight to Truk, Commander Norman M. Miller, the squadron’s commanding officer spotted a 5,000-ton freighter {{anchored in the}} lagoon. He made a beam attack, releasing three <b>bombs</b> at masthead <b>height,</b> heavily damaging the vessel. Miller then spotted a 10,000-ton ship that immediately exploded after his bomb run, destroying {{a large portion of}} the vessel. He then proceeded on to Poluwat, arriving over the Japanese airfield at minimum altitude, surprised and strafed a formation of 30 enemy soldiers. In this attack he destroyed one truck, an aircraft revetment and dropped two bombs on a radio station. In his last bomb run on the radio station the Liberator was hit four times by AA fire, one exploding directly above the cockpit, wounding both Miller and his second pilot. Despite his wounds and damage to the aircraft, Commander Miller flew the Liberator 800 mi back to base for a safe landing. Commander Miller was awarded the Navy Cross.|$|R

5000|$|Following this {{successful}} publicity flight, Streett {{was appointed}} assistant to General Billy Mitchell, {{the deputy chief}} of the Air Service. When Mitchell formed the 1st Provisional Air Brigade in May 1921 {{for the purpose of}} demonstrating that a bomber could sink a battleship, Streett was closely connected. Mitchell sent Streett to Air Corps headquarters to inform his superior Charles T. Menoher that the battleships could not be sunk as planned, with the bombers flying at 10000 ft. Streett informed Menoher that Mitchell intended to break the rules and fly much lower to ensure a newsworthy sinking, but that the Navy should not know of this change. During the June and July bombing demonstrations, Streett flew in the back seat as navigator in Osprey, Mitchell's personal DH-4B heavy bomber as they <b>bombed</b> from <b>heights</b> of about 2000 to 3000 ft. Mitchell also planned to sink the target ship with several very close near-miss explosions that would cause severe damage to the ship's hull below the waterline. The US Navy's rules for the bombing limited the actual number of direct hits allowed on the target ship. The US Navy had intended to inspect the damage to these ships after the bombings, and US Navy gunfire {{to learn as much as}} possible about the effects of shell & bomb hits on battleship armor and structure. The target ship, the former German World War I battleship Ostfriesland was sunk with only a few direct hits, and several intentional very near-misses. The US Navy leadership was shocked and angry over the target's sinking. In late July after the battleship Ostfriesland had been sunk, Mitchell carried out a 19-bomber mock raid against Manhattan. About the stunt, Streett wrote an article entitled [...] "14th Heavy Bombardment Squadron Attacks New York City" [...] for the Army and Navy aviation magazine U.S. Air Service.|$|R
2500|$|In the VIII Corps area, the 34th Division {{east of the}} Thuizy–Nauroy road, {{attacked}} at [...] {{with two}} regiments and an hour later, could be seen threading {{their way up the}} <b>heights,</b> <b>bombing</b> dug-outs and fighting hand-to-hand in the open with German infantry. By [...] part of Erfurt Trench and the communication trenches leading towards it, had been captured but the Germans retained a foothold, at the west end of the trench. The 83rd Regiment resumed the advance on Mont Cornillet and the 59th Regiment attacked Mont Blond the 34th Division took nearly all of its objectives on Mont Cornillet and Mont Blond, at the west end of the Moronvilliers massif. The troops on the left were exposed by the repulse of the troops to the west, beyond the Thuizy–Nauroy road. German resistance in the [...] to the south-east of Mont Blond, prevented its right from being supported by the 45th division. The 83rd Regiment managed a costly advance to the summit of Mont Cornillet but German machine-guns on the ridge between Mont Cornillet and Mont Blond, slowed the advance. The left flank of the 59th Regiment was stopped by the Germans at Flensburg Trench, which connected the German defences of Mont Cornillet and Mont Blond, losing touch with the 83rd Regiment.|$|R
50|$|Pre-invasion {{bombardment}} of Okinawa began on 24 March. Indianapolis spent 7 days pouring 8 in shells into the beach defenses. During this time, enemy aircraft repeatedly attacked the American ships. Indianapolis shot down six planes and damaged two others. On 31 March, the ship's lookouts spotted a Japanese Nakajima Ki-43 fighter as it {{emerged from the}} morning twilight and roared at the bridge in a vertical dive. The ship's 20 mm guns opened fire, but within 15 seconds, the plane was over the ship. Tracers converged on it, causing it to swerve, but the enemy pilot managed to release his <b>bomb</b> from a <b>height</b> of 25 ft, crashing his plane into the sea near the port stern. The bomb plummeted through the deck, into the crew's mess hall, down through the berthing compartment, and through the fuel tanks before crashing through the keel and exploding in the water underneath. The concussion blew two gaping holes in the keel which flooded nearby compartments, killing nine crewmen. The ship's bulkheads prevented any progressive flooding. Indianapolis, settling slightly by the stern and listing to port, steamed to a salvage ship for emergency repairs. Here, inspection revealed that her propeller shafts were damaged, her fuel tanks ruptured, and her water-distilling equipment ruined. But Indianapolis commenced the long trip across the Pacific, under her own power, to the Mare Island Navy Yard for repairs.|$|R
