5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1973. The airport {{needed to be}} built on permafrost. The runway is {{insulated}} against the ground, so it will not melt during the summer. The hangar is frozen into the ground, with the pillars being melted into place and then being frozen stuck. The runway was plagued with frost heave due to an incorrect construction method, forcing the airport to regularly re-asphalt the runway. In 1989, parts of the runway were re-insulated, giving these areas that previously had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> an acceptable solution. In 2006, this measure {{was conducted on the}} remaining parts of the runway. An upgrade to the terminal building to allow larger capacity was completed in 2007.|$|E
5|$|When {{the teams}} reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, leading English batsman Len Hutton had been dropped. The reason {{was said to}} be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling in the {{previous}} Test, during which he scored 20 and 13. Observers noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers. The English selectors believed such a sight would {{have a negative effect on}} the rest of the sidewhich was not in good batting formas it was a poor example from a key player. According to journalist and retired Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, Hutton's second innings at Lord's had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of his career and gave the impression he had been scared of the Australian pace attack. The omission generated considerable controversy, and pleased the Australians, who felt Hutton was England's best batsman, and thought he had been treated poorly by the selectors. Former Australian batsman Jack Fingleton pointed out that while Hutton had batted erratically and appeared uncomfortable in the previous Test, he also had a strong track record against the tourists, having made 52 and 64 for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Australia in the lead-up matches, and 94, 76 and 122 retired ill in his last three Test innings during the previous Ashes series of 1946–47. O'Reilly regarded Hutton's omission as punitive and vindictive. He said if Hutton needed to be shielded from the new ball attack, then England should have reshuffled their batting order to place their beleaguered opener down the order. O'Reilly said that as Hutton had a large range of attacking strokes, he was not a stereotypical, defensive opener who was mainly used to wear down the opening bowlers, and could be used in the middle order as an aggressor.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} 10 {{years had}} <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> decade for real wage growth since the 1860s.

Households ran an unprecedented deficit of 3% of GDP. Unemployment continued to fall, resulting in a 42-year low of 4.4% in June 2017, while real earnings also fell due to rising inflation.|$|E

25|$|Having <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> three-point {{shooting}} {{team in the}} NBL {{during their}} first two seasons in the competition – shooting a mediocre 28.8% from beyond the arc – head coach Richard Dickel was much more confident heading into the 2012 season, as he felt his squad was more balanced and contained more outside shooting weapons. With Tall Black Craig Bradshaw and experienced American Larry Abney, the Sharks hoped a better inside presence would help free up his outside shooters. Having revamped the roster in 2012, with only Kevin Braswell, James Paringatai, Dan Peck, Paratene McLeod and Andrew Wheeler returning from the 2011 squad, new faces included former Junior Tall Blacks captain Dion Prewster, Gold Coast Blaze development player Jimmy Todd, and former Otago Nuggets' guard Shaun Tilby. Despite what was considered a far more promising roster, the Sharks missed {{the playoffs for the}} first time, as they finished second to last on the ladder with a 5–11 win/loss record.|$|E

500|$|The [...] in mice {{administered}} cicutoxin by {{intraperitoneal injection}} is 48.3mg per kg body weight (mg/kg); this compares with 5.9mg/kg for mice given potassium cyanide by intraperitoneal injection, while the LD50 for arsenic via intraperitoneal injection in mice is 46.2mg/kg. The exact toxic dose of plant material in humans is unknown; {{it is thought}} ingestion of water hemlock in any quantity can result in poisoning and very small amounts may lead to death. Poisoning has been reported following children blowing whistles made from the hollow stem of water hemlock plants. Intoxication has also been reported following skin contact with the plant; a case was reported where a family of five people rubbed the plant onto the skin and were poisoned, with two children dying. Livestock have long <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> affected, leading to the common name [...] "cowbane". Poisoning in livestock is common and typically occurs following ingestion of roots of the plant. In the spring when the ground is soft, grazing animals tend to pull the entire plant {{out of the ground}} ingesting both the foiliage and the roots. Roots exposed by ploughing can also be the source of livestock poisonings. Ingestion of plant material may cause death in the animal in as little as 15 minutes.|$|E

Of these nine, {{a total of}} four further strengthened into cyclonic storms, while two attained their peaks as extremely severe cyclonic storms. In early June, Cyclonic Storm Ashobaa produced significant flooding in eastern Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Later that month, Deep Depression ARB 02 resulted in the worst floods in the Amreli district of Gujarat in 90 years. The storm resulted in 80 deaths and an estimated 16.5 billion Indian rupees in damage in the state. In late July and early August, Cyclonic Storm Komen resulted in between 187–280 deaths in northeastern India, Bangladesh and Myanmar due to torrential rains as it slowly moved through the region. In early November, Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Chapala, the strongest storm of the season, became the first recorded tropical cyclone to produce hurricane-force winds in Yemen. During the storm's passage, areas in southern Yemen received [...] of rainfall over 48 hours, or 700% of the average yearly precipitation.
