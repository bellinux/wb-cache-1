50|$|The Goodyear Polyglas tire was a <b>bias-belted</b> tire {{first made}} in 1967 by Goodyear. The tire had a wider tread {{than most other}} tires on the market {{at the time and}} used belts made of fiberglass. They {{initially}} were an original equipment tire on late 1960s muscle cars such as the Pontiac GTO, Dodge Charger R/T, Ford Mustang Mach I, Chevrolet Camaro Z-28 and many others along with comparable tires from various competitors such as the Firestone Wide-Ovals, Uniroyal´s Tiger Paw and BF Goodrich´s Radial T/A. The Goodyear Polyglas and comparable <b>bias-belted</b> tires began appearing as standard or optional equipment on many 1969-model passenger cars and nearly all 1970 to 1974 models. The most common version of the Polyglas found on muscle cars of that era was the Polyglas GT, {{which was one of the}} first commercially available raised white lettered tires on the market. Other versions of the Polyglas lineup were offered as blackwall or whitewall tires.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1960s, Seiberling {{launched}} the SuperWideSport series, a <b>bias-belted</b> tire aimed to the Muscle Car market, booming at the time. The tire featured a whitewall {{on one side}} and a redline on the other, also common on the tire market at the time. The tire achieved relatively good sales being that Seiberling's Akron rivals had released good products to compete, including Goodyear's Polyglas, Firestone's Wide-Oval, Uniroyal's Tiger Paw and BF Goodrich's Radial T/A. The tire success did not go unnoticed and by the early-1970s the Big Three had some Seiberlings as original equipment fitted on their cars.|$|E
50|$|Optional {{available}} equipment {{included a}} 350 cubic inch 2- or 4-barrel V-8, Turbo Hydra-matic 350 auto transmission, variable ratio power steering, power drum or power front disc brakes, E78x14 <b>bias-belted</b> tires, custom cloth interior trim, convenience center storage compartment, tilt steering wheel, climate control air conditioning with low Freon detector switch, rear window defogger (blower), tinted glass, sport mirrors with drivers remote control, bumper protective strips with white accent stripe- front and rear, bumper guards front and rear, color-coordinated body protective side moldings, deluxe wheel covers, deluxe wire wheel covers, chrome-plated styled wheels (Buick rally wheels) and a custom vinyl top. Steel-belted tires {{were introduced in}} 1975.|$|E
50|$|The 1973 Le Mans, {{along with}} all other GM intermediates, was new {{from the ground up}} but {{retained}} the same wheelbase lengths of 112 inches for two-door coupes, and 116 inches for four-door sedans and station wagons. All models featured the federally mandated 5-mile-per-hour front bumpers along with single headlights. Handling capabilities were greatly improved on all models due to new front-suspension components shared with the F-body Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro, improved rear-coil suspension and <b>bias-belted</b> tires (except Grand Ams, which got radial tires).Engine offerings were carried over from 1972 with revisions to meet the 1973 emission requirements. Standard on base Le Mans sedans and coupes was Chevrolet's 250-cubic-inch inline six-cylinder engine, while the Le Mans Sport Coupe, Luxury Le Mans sedans and coupes, and all Safari wagons got Pontiac's 350-cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor rated at 150 horsepower standard (optional on base Le Mans models). Optionally available on Le Mans, Le Mans Sport and Luxury Le Mans was a 400-cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carb and 170 horsepower, a 230-horsepower 400 four-barrel (standard with the GTO option) and a 250-horsepower 455 four-barrel was optional on all models. Planned and listed as an option for the 1973 GTO but never materialized was a 455 Super Duty V8 rated at 310 net horsepower for which introduction was delayed by Pontiac management due to emission issues until the spring of 1973 and then only in the smaller Firebird Formula and Trans Am pony cars.A three-speed automatic transmission was standard on Le Mans and Luxury Le Mans models while the GTO came with a floor-mounted three-speed with Hurst shifter. Available at extra cost was the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic with all engines while a four-speed manual with Hurst shifter was available with the 230-horsepower 400.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the fore-and-aft elastic response characteristics of 34 x 9. 9, type VII, 14 ply-rating aircraft tires of bias-ply, <b>bias-belted,</b> and radial-belted design. The investigation consisted of static and rolling tests on dry concrete pavements at the Langley aircraft landing loads and traction facility; statistical techniques which related the measured tire elastic characteristics to variations in the vertical load, inflation pressure, braking force and/or tire vertical deflection; and a semiempirical analysis which related the tire elastic behavior to measured wheel slippage during steady-state braking. The <b>bias-belted</b> tire developed the largest spring constant value for most loading conditions; the radial-belted tire, the smallest. The elastic response of the tire free periphery to static braking included both tread stretch and carcass torsional wind-up about the axle for the bias-ply and <b>bias-belted</b> tires and carcass wind-up alone for the radial-belted tire...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The power {{consumption}} and load capacity of agricultural machines have grown {{and the effects}} of pressure on the soil by tires have been still little investigated. In concern with sustainable development, the relationship machine-tire-soil must be in balance to give more consistency on the best use of tires for a given load. This study aimed to evaluate four tires of two constructive types, the bias belted tires and radial tires, both with respective rim diameters of 22. 5 and 26. 5 inches with variables measuring the footprint, elastic deformation, sinkage and resistance to penetration. A hydraulic press with an attachment shaft for tire mounting and a box of soil in which the tire has been imposed on a load of 53. 00 kN using nominal pressures recommended by the tire manufacturer. The radial construction tire with rim diameter of 26. 5 inches obtained less sinkage and resistance to penetration; however, greater elastic deformation and footprint compared to other tires. The <b>bias-belted</b> tire with 22. 5 -inch rim presented the highest resistance to penetration and the lowest elastic deformation...|$|E
