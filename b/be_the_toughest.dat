5|$|United States Navy SEALs have {{distinguished}} {{themselves as}} an individually reliable, collectively disciplined and highly skilled special operations force. The most important trait that distinguishes Navy SEALs {{from all other}} military forces is that SEALs are maritime special operations, as they strike from {{and return to the}} sea. SEALs (SEa, Air, Land) take their name from the elements in and from which they operate. SEALs are experts in direct action and special reconnaissance missions. Their stealth and clandestine methods of operation allow them to conduct multiple missions against targets that larger forces cannot approach undetected. Because of the dangers inherent in their missions, prospective SEALs go through what is considered by many military experts to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> training regime in the world.|$|E

25|$|General Hyakutake, {{commander}} of the 17th Army, commanded about 40,000 men. In addition, there were also about 20,000 naval personnel {{in the southern part}} of the island under Vice Admiral Tomoshige Samejima. One of the units in Hyakutake's command, the 6th Infantry Division under Lieutenant General Masatane Kanda, was reputed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> in the Imperial Japanese Army. Initially, Hyakutake was convinced of the Allied intent to remain permanently at Torokina and as a result remained on a defensive posture. The resulting delay in Japanese offensive action gave Griswold plenty of time to deploy his men in suitable defensive positions.|$|E
500|$|The {{team had}} several goals: factions {{should not be}} [...] "locked-in" [...] to certain strategies; players should have {{interesting}} things to do without unbalancing the game, and the factions must be fun to play. The team believed the [...] "coolness" [...] of the Progenitor aliens would determine {{the success or failure}} of Alien Crossfire. They strove to make them feel significantly different to play, but still compatible with the existing game mechanics. The developers eventually provided the aliens with Battle Ogres, a Planetary survey, non-blind research, and other powers to produce [...] "a nasty and potent race that would take the combined might of humanity to bring them down". Chris Pine modified the AI to account for the additions. The team also used artwork, sound effects, music, and diplomatic text to set the aliens apart. Other than the aliens, the Pirates proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> faction to balance because their ocean start gave them huge advantages.|$|E
500|$|Reports {{published}} by the DfES showed that although there are around 70% of 16 year olds who remain in full-time education, this declines to less than 50% {{by the time they}} reach 18, with the majority finding unskilled employment and even fewer going into employment where their training has relevance. There is also a small increase in those who become unemployed by the time they reach 18, which the government hoped to reduce with the act. It is these cases of unemployment which the government believes to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest,</b> whom it classifies as NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training). In 2006 an additional 7% of 16 year olds fell into this category and the proportion rose to 13% among 18 year olds. [...] In practice, only 1% of young people are classified as NEET during their time aged 16–18, due to churn between training, employment and NEET classification. In 2015 the percentage of 16-18 classified as NEET fell to 7.5%, the lowest figure since 2000.|$|E

Speaking {{on the extent of}} his involvement in the filmmaking process, Vikram said, [...] "Before beginning the film, I was totally involved in the research and preparation, but once on the sets, I go by what the director says." [...] He further clarified that he discussed every shot with Shankar, went for re-takes where necessary to make the scenes better, and gave suggestions, but left the [...] "ultimate verdict" [...] to the director. Disclosing that, among the three shades to his character, he found playing Ambi to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest,</b> he reasoned, [...] "Because as a hero you are not used to being a wimp on screen.

Stan {{believes}} Sparky to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> dog in South Park; but, when Sparky suddenly jumps on top of another male dog and begins humping him energetically, Cartman declares that Sparky is homosexual. At football practice for the school's team, the South Park Cows, Stan's Uncle Jimbo and his friend Ned show up and ask Coach Chef whether the boys can beat the betting spread of 70 points for the Cows' game against the Middle Park Cowboys. Impressed by a play from Stan, who is the quarterback and star of the team, Jimbo and Ned go to the bookmaker, where Jimbo bets $500 on the Cows. As a result, everyone else bets all their money on the team, and they threaten Jimbo if the Cows lose. Intimidated, Jimbo and Ned seek a back-up plan and learn that John Stamos' brother Richard will be singing [...] "Lovin' You" [...] at half-time. Consequently, they plan to detonate the mascot for Middle Park, by placing a bomb to explode when Richard Stamos sings the high F note in the song.|$|E
500|$|Chopra {{faced the}} {{challenge}} of her triple roles by playing each one as differently as possible. She used the script to identify unique characteristics of each—Aradhana is a Punjabi girl, Ruksar speaks with the manners of a popular Bollywood actress from Lucknow, and Radha displays a contemporary confidence. Of the three, Chopra found playing a girl from 1910 to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest.</b> She said, [...] "There was no reference point for it except some books," [...] and the few sketches Kohli was able to provide for costume design. Even with only written sources, she worked toward developing an accent {{that would have been}} typical for a Punjabi girl from Pakistan. In contrast, Chopra was able to consult Saira Banu, a leading Hindi film actress of the 1960s, to understand the way her character Ruksar lived. Like Kapoor, Chopra enjoyed the novelty of playing a character in 1910, [...] "a certain period which normally [...] would not get to play," [...] and she related best to her contemporary character Radha. But for her Ruksar was the most interesting. [...] "I got to play a superstar actress of the 1960s," [...] she said. [...] "I got to wear the glamorous clothes of those days, don big hair-dos and speak the way actresses spoke then. I loved all those things." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Cricket Ground hosted {{what many}} {{consider}} to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> Grand Final {{of all in}} 1973 when defending premiers Manly-Warringah faced the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, who were playing in their first ever Grand Final after joining the competition in 1967. The Sharks were Captain-coached by Great Britain halfback Tommy Bishop and had a forward pack led by his tough St. Helens and GB teammate Cliff Watson and 1973 Rothmans Medallist Ken Maddison, along with goal kicking 18-year-old whiz-kid centre Steve Rogers. Manly were coached by Ron Willey and captained by tough hooker Freddy Jones, and could boast internationals Ken Irvine, Ray Branighan, Bob Fulton, John O'Neill, British lock Malcolm Reilly, as well as tough tackling second-row forward Terry Randall and 19-year-old fullback Graham Eadie. From the opening kick off the game descended {{into a series of}} high or late tackles and several all-in brawls, though surprisingly referee Keith Page didn't send any player off, despite threatening to do so and repeatedly handing out cautions, including twice to all 26 players on the field. In the opening minutes of the game, Mal Reilly was felled in back play by Cronulla hooker Ron [...] "Rocky" [...] Turner well after he kicked the ball and, after writhing on the ground in agony with a badly bruised hip, left the field for a pain killing injection. When he returned he created mayhem with strong-arm tactics, although he was clearly out of sorts football wise and was replaced after just 25 minutes by John Bucknell. In the end, {{the difference between the two}} teams was Manly's international centre Bob Fulton who scored two tries in leading Manly to a 10–7 win. The game was described by Sunday Telegraph writer Ian Heads as [...] "A Grand Final as tough and dirty as any bar-room brawl".|$|E
