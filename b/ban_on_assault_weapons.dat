50|$|Following the Columbine {{school shootings}} {{on the morning}} of April 20, 1999, demand for more gun control {{measures}} increased from the mainstream media, including calls for restrictions on gun shows, child access prevention laws mandating the locking up of guns, and <b>bans</b> <b>on</b> <b>assault</b> <b>weapons.</b> However, some policy analysts argue that the specific gun control measures proposed in the Columbine aftermath are largely irrelevant.|$|R

25|$|In 2004, {{when the}} ban {{was set to}} expire, Feinstein {{sponsored}} a 10-year extension of the ban as {{an amendment to the}} Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act; while the amendment was successfully added, the act itself failed. The act was then revived in 2005, and, despite Feinstein's best efforts, was passed without an extension of the assault weapons ban. In response to the Sandy Hook School massacre, Sen. Feinstein has reintroduced legislation to reinstate the <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>assault</b> <b>weapons,</b> as well as many more restrictions.|$|E

In April 2007, {{he was among the}} breakaway Republicans to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. However, his record on the issue of abortion is otherwise a solidly pro-life one. Gregg has voted for some gun control measures and against others. He voted against the Brady Bill, but in recent years has voted for trigger control locks on firearms and in favor of the <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>assault</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E

40|$|The most {{frequent}} policy lesson drawn following the Columbine school shootings {{was the need}} for more gun controls. Review of the details of both Columbine and other contemporary school shootings indicates, however, that the specific gun control mea-sures proposed in their aftermath were largely irrelevant and almost certainly could not have prevented the incidents or reduced their death tolls. These measures included restrictions on gun shows, child access prevention laws mandating locking up guns, and <b>bans</b> <b>on</b> <b>assault</b> <b>weapons.</b> Ironically, exploitation of school shootings for the advo-cacy of irrelevant gun controls may have obscured the genuine merits of various gun control measures for reducing “ordinary ” gun violence. Thus, mass school shootings provided the worst possible basis for supporting gun control...|$|R
2500|$|Responding to {{a renewed}} {{national}} dialogue surrounding pervasive gun violence following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Governor Markell joined with Attorney General Beau Biden {{to introduce a}} series of five bills designed to curb gun violence.

2500|$|As {{governor}} of Massachusetts, in 2004 Romney signed a measure permanently extending a statewide <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> military-style <b>assault</b> <b>weapons,</b> such as AK-47's and Uzi's. At the bill-signing ceremony Romney said, [...] "Deadly <b>assault</b> <b>weapons</b> {{have no place}} in Massachusetts.... These guns are not made for recreation or self-defense. They are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people." [...] Proponents of the state semi-automatic <b>assault</b> <b>weapons</b> ban had argued that its passage was necessary because a similar ban at the federal level was also expiring.|$|R
500|$|Sestak and Specter {{held their}} {{first and only}} {{televised}} debate on May 1 at Philadelphia's Fox affiliate, during which the two candidates bitterly attacked each other's character and honesty. The two began arguing even before the hour-long debate formally began, when Sestak objected to Specter's use of notes {{and said that the}} rules did not allow them. The debate organizer ruled the notes were allowed. Specter criticized Sestak for campaign advertisements that accused the Senator of lying about Sestak's record. Specter said, [...] "Nobody has ever called me a liar," [...] and demanded an apology, to which Sestak did not respond. Specter also repeatedly asked Sestak to publicly release his military records, to which Sestak again refused to respond. Sestak accused Specter of using Republican-style tactics in the vein of Karl Rove, former adviser to George W. Bush, and said Specter's attacks were meant to mask his record of supporting Bush's failed economic policies. Specter insisted the questions raised about Sestak's naval record were legitimate because much of Sestak's campaign was based on his military background, adding, [...] "It goes to his ability to get things done, to get along with people. He's all peaches and cream on television." [...] Specter criticized Sestak for supporting the troop build-up in Afghanistan, while Sestak noted that Specter voted against a <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>assault</b> <b>weapons</b> in the 1990s. The Philadelphia Inquirer noted the debate was [...] "every bit as contentious as their Democratic Senate primary struggle has become in its closing days".|$|E

2500|$|During his 2002 gubernatorial campaign, Romney {{had been}} a {{supporter}} of the federal assault weapons ban, and had also said he believed [...] "in the rights of those who hunt to responsibly own and use firearms." [...] On July 1, 2004, Romney signed a permanent state <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>assault</b> <b>weapons,</b> saying at the signing ceremony for the new law, [...] "Deadly assault weapons have no place in Massachusetts. These guns are not made for recreation or self-defense. They are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people." [...] The law extended a temporary measure that had been in effect since 1998 and covered weapons such as the AK-47, Uzi, and MAC-10. [...] The same law also modified some other aspects of general firearms licensing regulations.|$|E

But I understand that's impractical," [...] Daley told attendees at a conference of gun control advocates in Washington, D.C. in 1998, during his third term. Daley {{was a member of the}} Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino.

500|$|On January 16, 2013, {{one month}} after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 {{executive}} orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control. He urged Congress to reintroduce an expired <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> military-style <b>assault</b> <b>weapons,</b> such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives {{for the first time since}} 2006. On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers. In a 2016 editorial in the New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed [...] "common-sense gun reform" [...] to women's suffrage and other civil rights movements in American history.|$|R

[...] In 1997, while the Assault Weapons Ban was in effect, he called for a stricter federal <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>assault</b> <b>weapons</b> and for handgun registration on the federal level. He also endorsed President Bill Clinton's proposals for more stringent federal gun-licensing requirements, [...] "I applaud the President's [...] proposals, and I will support them any way I can."

A week after {{publication of his}} leaks began, Ars Technica confirmed that Snowden had been an active participant at the site's online forum from 2001 through May 2012, discussing {{a variety of topics}} under the pseudonym [...] "TheTrueHOOHA". In a January 2009 entry, TheTrueHOOHA exhibited strong support for the U.S. security state apparatus and said leakers of classified information [...] "should be shot in the balls". However, Snowden disliked Obama's CIA director appointment of Leon Panetta, saying [...] "Obama just named a fucking politician to run the CIA". Snowden was also offended by a possible <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>assault</b> <b>weapons,</b> writing [...] "Me and all my lunatic, gun-toting NRA compatriots would be on the steps of Congress before the C-Span feed finished". Snowden disliked Obama's economic policies, was against Social Security, and favored Ron Paul's call for a return to the gold standard. In 2014 Snowden supported a basic income.|$|E
