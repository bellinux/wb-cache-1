5|$|Care must <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> {{avoid the}} {{accumulation}} of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass, particularly because plutonium's critical mass is {{only a third of}} that of uranium-235. A critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays. Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water.|$|E

5|$|Coal was {{expected}} {{to be able to be}} delivered to the station by rail, as well as by ship to the Port of Blyth. The station's coal storage area would have stored a minimum 45 days worth of coal supply. All of the station's pulverised fuel ash (PFA) may have been sold to the construction industry, transported to which in dry dust tankers. Unsold PFA and furnace bottom ash would <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> a landfill site by road.|$|E
5|$|Edmund {{cannot be}} placed within any ruling dynasty. Numismatic {{evidence}} suggests he succeeded Æthelweard. According to the historian Susan Ridyard, Abbo of Fleury's statement that Edmund was 'ex antiquorum Saxonum nobili prosapia oriundus' can <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> {{mean that he}} was descended from a noble and ancient race.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{when two}} or more rats from the same litter are {{of the same sex}} they live {{together}} with no disruptions but with the occasional friendly tussle and play fight. Although it is possible that rats from different litters can be integrated together, the integration process can be easy or hard. Several measures have to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> provide security for both rats.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} {{were posted}} by the Weather Bureau {{for the entire}} Alabama coast, and portions of the Mississippi coast from Biloxi eastward prior to the storm. Merchants in potentially affected areas prepared their stores ahead of the hurricane. The potential storm surge threat forced boats in Biloxi to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> shelter in a nearby landlocked harbor.|$|E

5|$|Rolling {{a person}} with an active tonic-clonic seizure onto their side and into the {{recovery}} position helps prevent fluids from getting into the lungs. Putting fingers, a bite block or tongue depressor in the mouth is not recommended as it might make the person vomit or result in the rescuer being bitten. Efforts should <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> prevent further self-injury. Spinal precautions are generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|The 19th century saw major {{development}} in healthcare in Arbroath. In 1836 a dispensary {{was set up}} by public subscription to provide medical care for the poor. In 1842 a typhus epidemic in the town {{led to the creation of}} a small fever ward to keep patients in isolation. The following year subscriptions began to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> develop this into Arbroath Infirmary, which opened in 1845, and moved to new premises in 1916.|$|E
5|$|The Hudson's Bay Company {{had lost}} a full year in the {{northern}} fur trade, and pressed for further steps to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> prevent another smallpox outbreak. Dr. D.W.J. Hagarty was appointed as medical superintendent of the Manitoba and North-West Superintendencies in October 1878. His mission was to vaccinate all Native persons resident in the Manitoba Superintendency. Every spring vaccinations were administered to thoe {{people who were not}} away hunting.|$|E
50|$|The Herrmann pass {{differs from}} the Classic Pass {{as it is the}} bottom packet which <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> the top, not the top packet that <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> the bottom. There are {{numerous}} variations of this pass.|$|R
50|$|In Houston, U.S. 290 is {{sometimes}} called the Northwest Freeway. The Texas Legislature officially designated this highway within Harris County as the Ronald Reagan Memorial Highway in 2005. U.S. 290 {{is also part of}} a hurricane evacuation route. That route starts at SH 6 in Galveston. SH 6 <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> U.S. 290. Then U.S. 290 <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> where the two highways break apart. Then SH 6 <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> Waco.|$|R
50|$|The Birgers <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> Stutthof, and {{transferred}} to Dachau {{only a few days}} later. From there, they <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> Kaufering IV, where they were forced to work in an underground German munitions factory that produced airplanes.|$|R
5|$|The M3 subtype of AML, {{also known}} as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), is almost universally treated with the drug all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in {{addition}} to induction chemotherapy, usually an anthracycline. Care must <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), complicating the treatment of APL when the promyelocytes release the contents of their granules into the peripheral circulation. APL is eminently curable, with well-documented treatment protocols.|$|E
5|$|The road {{over the}} pass was barely capable of {{handling}} the massive amounts of silver ore coming out of Aspen's mines. At first they had to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> Leadville by mule train to be smelted. Plants {{were built in the}} city soon afterwards, but it was still difficult and expensive to transport the silver obtained. The market was growing {{in the wake of the}} Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which required the U.S. government to buy the metal on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|Theobald {{called a}} church council at London in June 1160, which dealt partly {{with the issues}} of the papal schism; his health was poor and he had to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> the council in a litter. A further cause of {{distress}} to Theobald was what he saw as the ingratitude of Becket, who did not visit the ailing archbishop.|$|E
50|$|Their relics <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> from St-Aubin <b>to</b> Bayeux Cathedral {{during the}} Viking invasions. The relics <b>were</b> then <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> Caen during the Wars of Religion. Finally, they <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> Grancey in Champagne, where they rest today.

5|$|Warren Jeffs' prison {{life has}} been tumultuous. At Utah's Purgatory Correctional Facility, he {{suffered}} from infected ulcers on his knees, which resulted from praying days on end during solitary confinement. He attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself at one point. In August 2008, Jeffs went into convulsions after banging {{his head against the}} walls of his cell repetitively and had to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> a hospital by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|When welding {{dissimilar}} metals, {{the joint}} {{must have an}} accurate fit, with proper gap dimensions and bevel angles. Care should <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> avoid melting excessive base material. Pulsed current is particularly useful for these applications, as it helps limit the heat input. The filler metal should be added quickly, and a large weld pool should be avoided to prevent dilution of the base materials.|$|E
5|$|A {{long and}} winding route had to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, {{was at the}} extreme ends of the decks, {{and so was the}} {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E
