40|$|Capture {{efficiency}} (CE) of exhaust from {{a natural}} gas cooking range was quantified for three common designs of residential range hoods in laboratory experiments: (A) microwave exhaust combination; (B) short hood with grease-screen-covered air inlet at bottom; and (C) deep, open hood exhausting at top. Devices were evaluated at varying installation heights, at highest and lowest fan settings, {{and with the}} hood installed 15 cm away from back wall with intent to improve CE for <b>front</b> <b>burners.</b> Each configuration was evaluated for the oven and for three cooktop burner combinations (two back, two front, one front and one back). At highest fan settings and standard installation against the wall, Hoods A and C captured back cooktop burner exhaust at > 90 percent and Hood B at > 80 percent. In this configuration, CE for <b>front</b> <b>burner</b> exhaust was 73 - 78 percent for Hoods A and C but only 46 - 63 percent for Hood B. CEs followed similar patterns but were substantially lower on the lowest fan speed. Installing the hood {{away from the wall}} improved CE for oven and <b>front</b> <b>burners</b> on Hood A at low speed, but substantially reduced CE for back burners for all hoods at low and high speed...|$|R
40|$|The {{installed}} {{performance of}} cooking exhaust fans was evaluated through residential field experiments conducted on {{a sample of}} 15 devices varying in design and other characteristics. The sample included two rear downdraft systems, two under-cabinet microwave over range (MOR) units, three different installations of an under-cabinet model with grease screens across the bottom and no capture hood, two devices with grease screens covering {{the bottom of a}} large capture hood (one under-cabinet, one wall-mount chimney), four under-cabinet open hoods, and two open hoods with chimney mounts over islands. Performance assessment included measurement of airflow and sound levels across fan settings and experiments to quantify the contemporaneous capture efficiency for the exhaust generated by natural gas cooking burners. Capture efficiency is defined as the fraction of generated pollutants that are removed through the exhaust and thus not available for inhalation of household occupants. Capture efficiency (CE) was assessed for various configurations of burner use (e. g., single front, single back, combination of one front and one back, oven) and fan speed setting. Measured airflow rates were substantially lower than the levels noted in product literature for many of the units. This shortfall was observed for several units costing in excess of $ 1000. Capture efficiency varied widely (from < 5 percent to roughly 100 percent) across devices and across conditions for some devices. As expected, higher capture efficiencies were achieved with higher fan settings and the associated higher air flow rates. In most cases, capture efficiencies were substantially higher for rear <b>burners</b> than for <b>front</b> <b>burners.</b> The best and most consistent performance was observed for open hoods that covered all cooktop burners and operated at higher airflow rates. The lowest capture efficiencies were measured when a <b>front</b> <b>burner</b> was used with a rear backdraft system or with lowest fan setting for above the range systems that do not cover the <b>front</b> <b>burners...</b>|$|R

25|$|After several {{unsuccessful}} re-casts of {{the character}} of Mickey, {{the decision was made to}} kill him off, and in January 2010, Maggie was made a widow. Her storyline moved from supporting to <b>front</b> <b>burner</b> status with the decision to pair her with wealthy Victor Kiriakis and giving her a nasty rival with Vivian Alamain who was married to Victor at the time. After this storyline ended, Victor and Maggie were married, although she maintained her role as Horton matriarch. Maggie's life became further complicated by the revelation that Dr. Daniel Jonas was really the product of the eggs she had given in hopes of having a child years ago. Her airtime, relegated to only sporadic appearances for years (unless storyline had dictated her appearing more), became greater, and for the first time since the mid 1980s, she was considered a <b>front</b> <b>burner</b> character. This continued well past the mid 2010s, even after the leading characters of John and Marlena returned to the show, and exploded into leading character status once again in early 2016 after Daniel was suddenly killed off and other characters were introduced to create drama for both Maggie and Victor.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} metrics of airflow, sound, and {{combustion product}} capture efficiency (CE) were measured for {{a convenience sample}} of fifteen cooking exhaust devices, as installed in residences. Results were analyzed to quantify the impact of various device- and installation-dependent parameters on CE. Measured maximum airflows were 70 % or lower than values noted on product literature for 10 of the devices. Above-the-cooktop devices with flat bottom surfaces (no capture hood) – including exhaust fan/microwave combination appliances – were found to have much lower CE at similar flow rates, compared to devices with capture hoods. For almost all exhaust devices and especially for rear-mounted downdraft exhaust and microwaves, CE was substantially higher for back compared with <b>front</b> <b>burner</b> use. Flow rate, {{and the extent to which}} the exhaust device extends over the burners that are in use, also had a large effect on CE. A flow rate of 95 liters per second (200 cubic feet per minute) was necessary, but not sufficient, to attain capture efficiency in excess of 75 % for the <b>front</b> <b>burners.</b> A-weighted sound levels in kitchens exceeded 57 dB when operating at the highest fan setting for all 14 devices evaluated for sound performance...|$|R

This study reports capture efficiencies (CE) measured for cooking generated particles for scripted cooking procedures in a 121 -m 3 chamber with kitchenette.
