2500|$|In 1890, Lytton {{was called}} to New York City along with other D'Oyly Carte principals, to bolster the weak cast of the {{original}} New York production of The Gondoliers as the Duke of Plaza-Toro. Thereafter, he played the Rev. William Barlow in The Vicar of Bray, the McCrankie in Haddon Hall, and Captain Flapper in Billee Taylor, {{as well as the}} Gilbert and Sullivan roles. In late 1893, he added to his repertoire the role of King Paramount in the original touring company of Utopia, Limited.

She laughed as she heard the baffled buzzing outside her net, and, pointing her finger, addressed them mockingly. Wetherell took the same joy in this that a child takes in the action of a kitten dressed as a doll. To Eugene he said: ...|$|E

50|$|A 1967 French {{television}} production directed by Yves-André Hubert of the 1958 stage version mounted by Jean-Louis Barrault, with Jean-Pierre Granval (<b>Bobinet),</b> Jean Desailly (Gardefeu), Pierre Bertin (Baron), Georges Aminel (Brésilien), Jean Parédès (Frick, Prosper, Alfred), Micheline Dax (Metella), Geneviève Kervine (Baronne), Simone Valère (Gabrielle), conducted by André Girard, has been issued on DVD.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, to {{celebrate}} his work and his 80th birthday, Sothebys and <b>Bobinet</b> (the antique watch dealer) held a retrospective exhibition of his work, featuring every watch Daniels had made, except one which is held by the British Museum. He was given an Award of Doctor of Science honoris causa by City University London in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Carte asked popular lyricist Adrian Ross {{to rewrite}} the piece with as much {{emphasis}} on comedy as possible. Ross reduced the romantic parts (though he retained the Mirette-Gerard-Picorin-Bianca story) while boosting the comic part of <b>Bobinet</b> for Passmore, making {{the role of the}} Marquise lighter, and emphasizing past Savoy successes by strengthening the subplot regarding the past love between the Marquise and the Baron. He also rewrote existing lyrics and introduced more opportunities for dance numbers. Though Walter Passmore had created smaller roles in Jane Annie and Utopia Limited, the role of <b>Bobinet</b> was his first real starring part. In the fall of 1894, Passmore named his new daughter Mirette, perhaps in acknowledgement of his success in this breakout role. Cast changes, including adding another Savoy favourite, Richard Temple, as the Baron and engaging the soprano Florence St. John as Mirette, turned Mirette into something of a success. It opened on 6 October 1894 and was still going strong when it was withdrawn {{to make way for a}} new Sullivan opera, The Chieftain.|$|E
50|$|Both {{versions}} essentially {{tell the}} same story, {{with the second}} version emphasizing comedy over the romance of the first version. The music has been mostly forgotten. However, one song ("Long ago in Alcala") became very popular in the United States {{in the early years}} of the twentieth century, though it was not credited as being from Mirette. The piece featured Savoy regulars Courtice Pounds (Picorin), Rosina Brandram (Marquise), Scott Russell (Bertuccio), Emmie Owen (Zerbinette), Florence Perry (Bianca), R. Scott Fishe (Gerard de Montigny), and Walter Passmore (<b>Bobinet).</b> Richard Temple joined in the revised version, as did the experienced singer Florence St. John, who made her Savoy debut in the work.|$|E
5000|$|Cantor first {{appeared}} on Broadway covering the role of Che in Evita (1982) and then playing Che in the first national tour of the musical on the U.S. west coast. The New York Times later wrote on July 14, 1985 of Cantor's performance in a regional theatre production of Evita: [...] "David Cantor, a veteran in the part, is a marvelous Che, never lapsing into excessive snideness, singing gorgeously and, at times, sailing into the stratosphere with his crystalline 'high-flying, adored' pianissimi." [...] His next role on Broadway was <b>Bobinet</b> in La Vie parisienne by Jacques Offenbach (1983). He also played Benny in a national tour of The Desert Song by Sigmund Romberg (1988).|$|E

5000|$|He wandered to Liverpool, then to Dublin in 1816 where, {{at the age}} {{of twenty-five}} he was {{established}} in business for himself, to sell <b>bobinet</b> lace, manufactured in Nottingham. His shop was in Crow street, Dublin, near the Crow Street Theatre, and immediately opposite to a favorite haunt of jolly boys (topers), called Peter Kearney's Inn. To that resort George frequently repaired, and there he made many theatrical acquaintances. The bobinet-lace business lasted six months, when George settled his affairs, took down his sign, and returned to England, to embark on that theatrical career which continued, through many vicissitudes of fortune, {{to the end of his}} days. George Holland was fifty-three years an actor, - more than half-a-century of entrances and exits! ...|$|E
50|$|The Brazilian millionaire is {{offering}} a masked ball at a restaurant. The head waiter tells his staff to be discreet during about the guests ("Avant toute chose, il faut être... Fermez les yeux"). The baron arrives for his assignation with Métella, while growing increasingly suspicious of the goings-on. Métella tells the baron to be patient ("C'est ici l'endroit redouté des mères") but {{she will not be}} his entertainment: she is in love with someone else but has brought a friend for him. The baron is furious when he discovers that her lover is Gardefeu. The Brazilian arrives, then <b>Bobinet</b> and Gardefeu. After showing Métella the letter ("Vous souvient-il, ma belle") she and Gardefeu are reconciled, and the baron's fury only stops when baroness intervenes. All toast Paris ("Par nos chansons et par nos cris, célébrons Paris.").|$|E
5000|$|At the Théâtre des Variétés, {{he acted}} {{in the main}} opéra-bouffes by Jacques Offenbach : La Belle Hélène (in the rôle of Calchas), Barbe-Bleue (comte Oscar), La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein (prince Paul), Le Pont des soupirs (Le Chef du Conseil des dix), Les Braconniers (Campistrous), the second version of La Vie Parisienne (<b>Bobinet)</b> and La Périchole (the Viceroy in the two {{versions}} in 1868 and 1874). He also appeared in several other pieces, including Monsieur Jules, L'Homme n'est pas parfait, Le Tour du cadran, Le Trône d'Écosse by Hervé and Les Merveilleuses. He {{was a member of}} the Membre du [...] "Comité des Artistes"and died suddenly in 1875. A benefit concert in aid of his mother was organised by his fellow actors on 28 September 1875 - this marked the final stage appearance of the actress Virginie Déjazet.|$|E
50|$|At Gardefeu's home, his glove-maker Gabrielle and his boot-maker Frick {{await the}} master's return ("Entrez ! entrez, jeune fille à l'œil bleu !"). Gardefeu {{continues}} his pretence with the Swedes, explaining {{that they are}} in an annexe to the hotel, hoping to get the baron out of the way so that he can pay attention to the baroness; the baron already has his plans based on a letter from a friend ("Dans cette ville toute pleine"). The baron then asks to take the table d'hôte. The problem of missing hotel guests is solved by getting Gabrielle and Frick and their friends to impersonate other hotel guests. <b>Bobinet</b> calls by and offers to stage a party for the Swedes at his absent aunt's mansion the following night, with the baron invited. The baroness finds remnants of Gardefeu's affair with Métella in her room. Métella herself now arrives hoping for a reconciliation with Gardefeu ("Vous souvient-il, ma belle") and ends with offering to entertain the baron in a few days. The guests arrive for the table d'hôte; Frick as a major ("Pour découper adroitement") and Gabrielle as a war widow ("Je suis veuve d'un colonel") and with a tyrolienne everyone retires to supper ("On est v'nu m'inviter").|$|E
50|$|The {{story begins}} at the Gare d l'Ouest, where the {{employees}} list the provenance of trains arriving from different places in France ("Nous sommes employés de la ligne de l'Ouest"). Two Parisian dandies, <b>Bobinet</b> and Gardefeu {{are waiting for the}} train from Rambouillet, but avoid each other while they walk around. They have fallen out over the demi-mondaine Métella. She arrives with a third man and pretends not to recognize the two previous lovers. Her rejection reunites the two friends and they vow to seek a better class of mistress ("Elles sont tristes, les marquises"). While wondering how he will achieve this Gardefeu sees his former servant Joseph, now a tourist guide. Joseph reveals that he is to meet a Swedish baron and his wife who he is to show around Paris but for a sum agrees to let Gardefeu take his place. While he goes to look for the baron, Gardefeu wonders what will happen with the baroness ("Ce que c'est pourtant que la vie !") The Baron and Baroness Gondremarck enter he promises to show them everything they want to see in the French capital ("Jamais, foi de cicérone"). The station fills with more passengers arriving for a good time in Paris, including a Brazilian returning after having spent his fortune once before in the city ("Je suis Brésilien, j'ai de l'or").|$|E
