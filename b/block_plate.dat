40|$|The Khunik {{prospecting}} area {{is located}} 106 km south of Birjand in eastern Iran, {{and is considered}} as an epithermal gold prospecting area. The mineralization is related to subvolcanic rocks. There are several outcrops of subvolcanic intrusions in the area which intruded into Paleocene–Eocene volcanic rocks (andesite, trachy-andesite and pyroclastic rocks). Petrographic studies indicate that subvolcanic rocks consist mainly of diorite, monzonite, quartz-monzonite, monzodiorite and quartz-monzodiorite. Mineralogically, these rocks contain plagioclase, K-feldspar, amphibole, pyroxene, biotite and quartz. Geochemically, they have features typical of high-K calk-alkaline to shoshonitic and are metaluminous, and also belong to magnetite granitoid series (I-type). Primitive mantle normalized trace element spider diagrams display enrichment in LILE, such as Rb, Ba, and Cs, compared to HFSE. Chondrite-normalized REE plots show moderately LREE enriched patterns (7. 45 < LaN/YbN < 10. 54), and no significant Eu anomalies. Tectonic discrimination diagrams also show affinities with modern convergent margin magmas, suggesting that magmas of Khunik area formed in volcanic arc setting related to subduction of the oceanic crust under the Lut <b>Block</b> <b>plate.</b> The initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios (0. 704196 – 0. 704772) and eNdi values (+ 1. 3 to + 3. 3) are compatible with an origin of the parental melts in a supra-subduction mantle wedge. Zircon U–Pb dating by LA-ICP-MS indicates the age of 38 ± 1 Ma (late Eocene) for subvolcanic units {{that are related to}} mineralization. A biotite granodiorite porphyry is the testimony of the youngest magmatic activity in the area, with an age of 31 ± 1 Ma (early Oligocene). The represented dates are interpreted as magmatic crystallization ages of subvolcanic intrusions...|$|E

[...] 2014 American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting, 15 - 19 {{december}} 2014, San FranciscoA primarily {{analysis of}} marine geophysical data acquired aboard the RRS James Cook {{in the framework}} of the project >Characterization of seismic hazard and tsunami associated with cortical contact structure Rivera Jalisco <b>Block</b> <b>Plate</b> (TSUJAL) > is presented. This survey was held in the region of Nayarit-Tres Marias Islands between February and March 2014. The examination of data recorded by 16 OBS 's, deployed along 4 wide angle seismic profiles is shown, using an airgun-array seismic source of 6800 cu. in., which allows sampling the crustal structure to the Moho. The profiles are along the margin of the Marias Islands, a profile of over 200 km NNW-SSE direction and parallel to the western flank of the Marias Islands, and three orthogonal thereto. These perpendicular profiles sample the lithosphere from the north of Maria Madre Island with a profile of 100 km length, across Maria Magdalena and Mari Cleofas Islands, center of the archipelago, with a profile of 50 km long, till south of Maria Cleofas with a profile of 100 km long. Coincident multichannel seismic profiles with refraction ones are also surveyed, although shooting with a source of 3, 540 cu. In., and acquired with a digital >streamer> of 6. 0 km long. Simultaneously, multibeam, parametric and potential field data were recorded during seismic acquisition A first analysis shows an anomalously thickened crust in the western flank of the Marias Islands, as indicated by relatively short pre-critical distances of 30 - 35 km. While the moderate dip of 7 ° of the subduction of the Pacific oceanic plate favors somehow this effect, the existence of a remnant crustal fragment is also likely. Moreover, the images provided by the parametric sounding show abundant mass wasting deposits suggesting of recent active tectonics, possibly generated by earthquakes with moderate magnitude as those reported in the Marias Islands. This set of geophysical data, not only provide valuable information for the seismogenic characterization and associated hazard with Rivera-Plate/Jalisco block, but it will also contribute to decipher the complex interplay between the accretion of the East Pacific Rise, the Magdalena Crest and the opening of the Gulf of California in the northeastern part of the diffuse Middle America TrenchPeer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: To {{measure the}} {{variation}} in posterior tibial slope angle and patellar height in patients who underwent proximal tibial valgus-producing osteotomy using the medial-opening wedge technique. Methods: Anteroposterior panoramic radiographs of the lower limbs and lateral radiographs of the knee obtained before and after tibial valgus-producing osteotomy on 46 patients with unicompartmental arthrosis of the knee were analyzed. Results: In 23 patients, an external fixator was used to gradually apply a medial-opening wedge; {{and in the other}} 23, a <b>blocked</b> <b>plate</b> with a stop bar was applied as a fixation method. Patients with tricompartmental knee disease and those who underwent osteotomy to treat fracture sequelae were excluded from this study. After surgery, the mean increase in the tibial slope was 1. 7 degrees (p < 0. 01) in the group in which the <b>blocked</b> <b>plate</b> with a stop bar was used; and 2. 7 degrees (p < 0. 05) in the group in which the external fixator was used. There was no statistical difference between the groups regarding the increase in the posterior tibial slope. Conclusion: The patellar height did not present any change in the cases in which the plate was used, when measured using the Insall-Salvati method, but it presented a decrease in 11 cases (47. 8 %) when the Caton-Deschamps method was applied. The same tendency was observed regarding change in the patellar height in the cases in which the external fixator was used, such that a decrease was observed in eight cases (34. 7 %) only when measured using the Caton-Deschamps method...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an extensive simulation study of power {{loss in the}} lubricating gap between cylinder <b>block</b> and valve <b>plate.</b> The simulation model used in this investigation covers fluid structure interaction and micro motion of the cylinder block resulting from oscillating piston forces. The model calculates pressure and velocity fields generated in the lubricating film as well as leakage, and viscous friction. Details of the model are explained. Using the model, power losses in the cylinder <b>block</b> valve <b>plate</b> gap are investigated {{as a function of}} operating condition for three displacement units. It is shown that power losses for low load operating conditions are approximately the same as power loss for high load operating conditions. In order to reduce losses at low loads, a sinusoidal or wavy micro structured surface is applied to the cylinder block surface. The effect of operating parameters that waved surfaces of varying amplitude and frequency have on power loss in the cylinder <b>block</b> valve <b>plate</b> interface when compared to power loss of a standard, ideally smooth sliding surface is studied. As the gap height of the lubricating film represents the most critical parameter relating to pump performance, special attention is given to the relation between gap height, operating parameters, surface design and power loss. It is shown that significant reductions in power loss occur at low pressure operating conditions with the introduction of the waved surface. ...|$|R
