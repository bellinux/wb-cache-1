For this purpose, samarium-153 is chelated with ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP) and injected intravenously. The chelation prevents accumulation of radioactive samarium in the body that would result in excessive irradiation and generation of new cancer cells. The corresponding drug has several names including samarium (153Sm) lexidronam; its trade name is Quadramet.|$|E
5|$|Technetium-99 decays {{almost entirely}} by beta decay, {{emitting}} beta particles with consistent low energies and no accompanying gamma rays. Moreover, its long half-life means that this emission decreases very slowly with time. It can also be extracted to a high chemical and isotopic purity from radioactive waste. For these reasons, it is a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard <b>beta</b> <b>emitter,</b> and is used for equipment calibration. Technetium-99 has also been proposed for optoelectronic devices and nanoscale nuclear batteries.|$|E

50|$|Bremsstrahlung is {{of concern}} when {{shielding}} <b>beta</b> <b>emitters,</b> as the interaction of beta particles with the shielding material produces Bremsstrahlung radiation.

25|$|Tritium is an isotope of hydrogen, {{which allows}} it to readily bind to {{hydroxyl}} radicals, forming tritiated water (HTO), and to carbon atoms. Since tritium is a low energy <b>beta</b> <b>emitter,</b> it is not dangerous externally (its beta particles are unable to penetrate the skin), {{but it can be}} a radiation hazard when inhaled, ingested via food or water, or absorbed through the skin. HTO has a short biological half-life in the human body of 7 to 14 days, which both reduces the total effects of single-incident ingestion and precludes long-term bioaccumulation of HTO from the environment. Biological half life of tritiated water in human body, which is a measure of body water turn over, varies with season. Studies on biological half life of occupational radiation workers for free water tritium in the coastal region of Karnataka, India show that the biological half life in winter season is twice that of the summer season.|$|E
500|$|Naturally {{occurring}} actinium {{is composed}} of two radioactive isotopes; [...] (from the radioactive family of [...] ) and [...] (a granddaughter of [...] ). [...] decays mainly as a <b>beta</b> <b>emitter</b> with a very small energy, but in 1.38% of cases it emits an alpha particle, so it can readily be identified through alpha spectrometry. Thirty-six radioisotopes have been identified, the most stable being [...] with a half-life of 21.772 years, [...] with a half-life of 10.0 days and [...] with a half-life of 29.37 hours. All remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 10 hours {{and the majority of}} them have half-lives shorter than one minute. The shortest-lived known isotope of actinium is [...] (half-life of 69 nanoseconds) which decays through alpha decay and electron capture. Actinium also has two known meta states. The most significant isotopes for chemistry are 225Ac, 227Ac, and 228Ac.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the closest}} of all {{attempts}} to produce the missing element 93 was that conducted by the Japanese physicist Yoshio Nishina working with chemist Kenjiro Kimura in 1940, just before {{the outbreak of the}} Pacific War in 1941: they bombarded 238U with fast neutrons. However, while slow neutrons tend to induce neutron capture through a (n, γ) reaction, fast neutrons tend to induce a [...] "knock-out" [...] (n, 2n) reaction, where one neutron is added and two more are removed, resulting in the net loss of a neutron. Nishina and Kimura, having tested this technique on 232Th and successfully produced the known 231Th and its long-lived beta decay daughter 231Pa (both occurring in the natural decay chain of 235U), therefore correctly assigned the new 6.75-day half-life activity they observed to the new isotope 237U. They confirmed that this isotope was also a <b>beta</b> <b>emitter</b> and must hence decay to the unknown nuclide 23793. They attempted to isolate this nuclide by carrying it with its supposed lighter congener rhenium, but no beta or alpha decay was observed from the rhenium-containing fraction: Nishina and Kimura thus correctly speculated that the half-life of 23793, like 231Pa, was very long and hence its activity would be so weak as to be unmeasurable by their equipment, thus concluding the last and closest unsuccessful search for transuranic elements.|$|E

50|$|In health physics, whole-body {{counting}} {{refers to}} the measurement of radioactivity within the human body. The technique is primarily applicable to radioactive material that emits gamma rays. Alpha particle decays can also be detected indirectly by their coincident gamma radiation.

5000|$|For this reason, an {{instrument}} {{such as the}} dual phosphor scintillation probe, which will discriminate between alpha and beta, is used where routine checking will come across alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>emitters</b> simultaneously.

In 1913 she transferred to Karlsruhe University, {{working under the}} direction of Kasimir Fajans, the discoverer of isotopes, for the next eight months. During the summer of 1914, she studied at University College London, but returned to Budapest at the outbreak of World War I. Taking a position at Budapest's Chemical Institute, she completed a scientific paper on the [...] "diffusion constant of radon in water". [...] Working with George de Hevesy, she was asked to verify a new element [...] at the time was termed Uranium-Y, now known as Th-231. Though others had failed to confirm the element, Rona was able to separate the Uranium-Y from interfering elements, proving it was a <b>beta</b> <b>emitter</b> (β-emission) with a half-life of 25 hours. The Hungarian Academy of Sciences published her findings. Rona first coined the terms [...] "isotope labels" [...] and [...] "tracers" [...] during this study, noting that the velocity of diffusion depended on the mass of the nuclides. Though contained in a footnote, this was the basis {{for the development of the}} mass spectrographic and heavy water studies later performed by other scientists.

40|$|A beta spectrometer, {{consisting}} of a liquid scintillation counter, coupled to a programmable multichannel analyser was used {{to achieve the objective}} of detecting and measuring beta activity in low level aqueous environmental solution as well as identifying the radioisotopes present. Aqueous solutions of standard <b>beta</b> <b>emitters,</b> covering a range of energies between 18. 6 KeV and 3550 KeV, were used to develop computer methods for analysis. The best proportions of the counting cocktail was found consist of 4. 0 ml of aqueous sample, 3. 0 ml of Triton X- 100 and 3. 0 ml of toluene containing 4. 0 g per litre PRO and 0. 4 g per litre POPOP. The effects of pH, acids, bases, buffers, and salts on the stability of the mixture and on the detection efficiency of the radioisotopes, were investigated and found not to be severe. Pretreatment of the sample was not required. It was found that temperature changes, beyond the operating temperature range, could result severe errors. 1024 channels of aquisition area, for the collection of the spectra, give good conditions for computer analysis. End channel and channel number of maximum count calibration gave a linear relationship to the Em, of standard <b>beta</b> <b>emitters.</b> It was found that the theoretical fitting of the spectra is possible and the normalisation ratio V of the theoretical to the experimental fitting procedure has alinear relationship to the activity of emitter. Kurie plot was applied for checking the Emav value of the emitters used. Application of the Cerenkov counting technique for <b>beta</b> <b>emitters,</b> gives extra data to support the main results. For the analysis of environmental solutions, which may contain a variety of radioisotopes, the system was used to obtain spectra of alpha <b>emitters,</b> <b>beta</b> <b>emitters</b> with internal conversion and Cerenkov radiation.

A spectral stripping technique was developed to de-convolve the multi-response distribution (beta energy absorption spectrum) into its component parts for the identification and quantification of its constituent radionuclides. The method provided reliable results in identifying the studied radionuclides and determining their relative combination of source activity. The results revealed variations in percentages between the original emission and collected spectra that was found to be less than 2 % in all studied spectra. Those variations were believed to be attributed to some degree of uncertainty in the spectral stripping method and some energy loss prior to detection...|$|R
