40|$|For ammonia-water {{absorption}} refrigeration technology it {{is suggested}} to use bubble type absorbers because the higher contact surface area provides a higher mass transfer rate. Furthermore, dispersion of bubbles in the bulk of liquid phase also exhibits better heat transfer characteristics that facilitate the recovery of dissipated heat of the exothermic absorption. In this context, plate heat exchangers {{are believed to be}} an option to be employed as absorber in some applications. Commercial plate heat exchangers have only one inlet and outlet for a working fluid and as a result, gas and liquid should be mixed before supplied to a gap between the two adjacent plates. The consequence is the high risk of bubble mergence to form a bigger bubble and to follow the shortest flow paths in vertical direction so that not all the heat transfer surface can be effectively used. Furthermore this feature makes plate heat exchangers sensitive to the angle of plate relative to the vertical which would be worst when it is laid to its side on a horizontal plane. Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) develops an efficient <b>Bubble</b> <b>Plate</b> Absorber for applications in high-pressure absorption systems and this work tries to investigate design possibility of this <b>Bubble</b> <b>Plate</b> Absorber based on a plate heat exchanger equipped with microchannels between plates. Two sets of seven parallel microchannels same in shape and dimension were tested. The first set had a continuous wall which means fluids could flow independently along the microchannels; whereas, the other set was benefiting from some linkages between channels that fluids could cross from one microchannel to another one. Ammonia vapour was injected via one and two-holed distributors. It was found that microchannels with continuous wall deliver higher concentration and less unabsorbed bubbles at the microchannels outlet. In visual analysis by high-speed camera, changing the vapour distributors from single-hole to double-hole had no significant effect on the bubble distribution quality in lower flowrates; however, double-hole vapour distributor showed better performance in higher vapours flowrates...|$|E
40|$|The hydrate-based {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) capture from the {{integrated}} gasification combined cycle (IGCC) synthesis gas using the bubble method is investigated {{with a set}} of visual equipment in this work. The gas bubble is created with a <b>bubble</b> <b>plate</b> {{on the bottom of the}} equipment. By the visual equipment, the hydrate formation and the hydrate shape are visually captured. With the move of the gas bubble from the bottom to the top of the reactor, gas hydrate forms firstly from the gas-liquid boundary around the bubble, then the hydrate gradually grows up and piles up in the bottom side of the bubble to form a hydrate particle. The gas hydrate shape is affected by the gas flow rate. The hydrate is acicular crystal at the low gas flow rate while the hydrate is fine sand-like crystal at the high gas flow rate. The bubble size and the gas flow rate have an obvious impact on the hydrate-based CO 2 separation process. The experimental results show the gas bubble of 50 mu m and the gas flow rate of 6. 75 mL/min/L are ideal for CO 2 capture from IGCC synthesis gas under the condition of 3. 0 MPa and 274. 15 K.

The multiscale nature of the problem, where the bubble size is on the millimetre range and the film drainage process happens on the micrometre to nanometre scale requires the combined use of different modelling techniques. On the macro scale we solve the full Navier–Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates to model bubble rise whereas modelling film drainage on the micro scale is based on lubrication theory because the film Reynolds number becomes much smaller than unity. Quantitative predictions of this model are compared with experimental data obtained using synchronised high-speed cameras. Video recording of bubble rise and bounce trajectories are combined with interferometry data to deduce the position and time-dependent thickness of the thin water film trapped between the deformed bubble and the glass <b>plate.</b> <b>Bubble</b> rise velocity indicated that the boundary condition at the bubble surface was tangentially immobile.

40|$|The {{dissolution}} {{of a single}} stationary bubble {{held in place by}} a horizontal plate is commonly observed experimentally. For several decades the standard approach to the analysis of such dissolution data has been to apply a correction factor of ln(2) = 0. 69 ln(2) = 0. 69 to the Epstein–Plesset equation for an isolated bubble. In this paper, the transport equations for a stationary <b>bubble</b> touching a <b>plate</b> are solved numerically for the common case where the flow field caused by the change in system volume as the bubble dissolves can be neglected. It is found that the total bubble lifetime is not well characterised by the use of the ln(2) ln(2) factor. However, in most experimental situations, the initial stages of bubble dissolution are not captured. For low gas solubilities the use of a correction factor of 0. 69 to the Epstein–Plesset equation is appropriate once the initial transients have dissipated. The correction factor varies from 0. 69 to 0. 77 across the full range of situations described in this paper. The mathematical model is validated by comparison to experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{methods of}} contact angle {{analysis}} include sessile drop, captive <b>bubble</b> and Wilhelmy <b>plate</b> techniques; however, these methodologies {{are not particularly}} well suited for assessing the wettability of the surfaces of formed hydrogel contact lenses.

The lenses were manufactured by lathing, spin-casting or cast-moulding techniques. Overall, both techniques demonstrated few differences between the wettability of different lens materials and no differences between materials of the 'same' lens type but manufactured by different methods. These findings are consistent with the results of clinical studies, which have shown little difference between contact lens surface wettability in vivo, which {{may be due to the}} apparent natural surface wettability-enhancing properties of the pre-lens tear film...|$|R
40|$|The main aims of {{this project}} were to:- -	Use {{ultrasound}} to enhance the plating rate of an electroless copper process at low temperatures -	Replace formaldehyde by using another reducing agent, which is more environmentally beneficial to the industry. The effects of ultrasound on the electroless copper plating of epoxy substrates using different frequencies (40 and 850 kHz) has been investigated at different temperatures (25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 ºC) with different reducing agents (formaldehyde and glyoxylic acid) and in the presence and absence of air <b>bubbling.</b> The conventional <b>plating</b> rate in this process is (1. 25 µm / 25 minutes) at 46 ºC. Ultrasound was applied during the plating process and also with an added delay {{at the start of}} the plating process. Several parameters were monitored such as plating rate (via calculation of weight gain), stability of the plating bath (UV) the reflectance percentage (Gloss Meter), test of substrate surface by scanning electronic microscope (SEM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The adhesion of the copper layer on the substrate surface also was examined. The results obtained clearly indicate that use of 40 kHz sonication leads to the highest plating rate at 35 and 40 ºC when a time delay of 7 minutes is introduced before applying ultrasound. The deposition rate increased from 1. 43 µm/ 25 minutes to 1. 65 µm/ 25 minutes at 35 oC and from 1. 86 µm/ 25 minutes to 2. 54 µm/ 25 minutes at 40 oC. Sonication was also found to be unhelpful at 25 and 30 ºC where the deposition rate was found to decrease at these temperatures at both frequencies (40 and 850 kHz) from 0. 75 µm/ 25 minutes to 0. 27 µm/ 25 minutes at 25 oC and from 1. 18 µm/ 25 minutes to 1. 11 µm/ 25 minutes at 30 oC. Introduction of air <b>bubbling</b> reduced the <b>plating</b> rate but enhanced the copper bath stability at 40 ºC. All results showed that the plating rate was much higher with formaldehyde than with glyoxylic acid. SEM results also show that application of ultrasound causes a fine grain structure which impacts on the colour of the substrate surface, as the gloss meter results show. Unfortunately UV results indicate that with sonication it appears that the stability of the electroless plating bath is much reduced with copper precipitating out of the solution after sonication. This indicates that the use of this technology may prove problematical in ‘real life’ conditions...|$|R
40|$|A non-equilibrium {{oscillating}} bubble {{within a}} narrow gap in between two flat perspex plates has, in earlier studies, {{been reported to}} show complex behavior when it is centered between the plates. We study here {{what happens when the}} bubble is created in an off-centered position with respect to the mid-plane between the plates. The effect of the non-dimensional gap-width, i. e. the gap width normalized by the maximum bubble radius, and a second parameter which indicates the degree of offset from the center are studied. A high-speed imaging technique which utilizes a single camera and a set of mirrors to simultaneously capture both the side-view and the front-view of the bubble dynamics is employed in this study. Results show that while the direction in which the bubble forms a jet depends on the non-dimensional gap-width with a change of direction observed at a value of 0. 5, the degree of offset {{does not seem to have}} any influence on the jet direction. Additionally, the behavior of a centered <b>bubble</b> between two <b>plates</b> which are positioned near a free surface is also presented.

Specifically we construct and analyse a mathematical model for a long, two-dimensional bubble confined between superheated or subcooled parallel plates, whose motion is driven by mass transfer between the liquid and the vapour. The present model is similar to that previously proposed by Wilson, Davis and Bankoff (1999), but differs from it in one crucial respect, namely that, unlike the earlier work, it includes significant mass transfer from and/or to the semi-circular cap regions at the nose of the bubble as well as from and/or to the thin liquid films attached to the plates. The inclusion of this additional contribution to the overall mass transfer significantly alters the dynamics of the <b>bubble.</b> When both <b>plates</b> are superheated the bubble always expands. In this case there are two possible constant-velocity travelling-wave solutions for the expansion of the bubble, namely an unstable fast mode and a stable slow mode. The evolution of the bubble is calculated numerically for a range of values of the parameters. In particular, these calculations show that eventually the bubble expands either with the constant velocity of the slow mode or exponentially. When both plates are subcooled the bubble always collapses to zero length in a finite time. When one plate is subcooled and the other plate is superheated the situation is rather more complicated...|$|R

Three nanostructured plates featuring Si nanowires of diameter 850 nm and of three different lengths, 900 nm, 1800 nm and 3200 nm respectively, which are etched through single crystal p-type silicon wafers using metal assisted chemical etching (MaCE), are utilized to enhance the pool boiling heat transfer. A plain surface Si plate is used as the control sample. C onstant heat flux is provided to the liquid within the pool {{on the surface of}} the aluminum base through the plate by boiling heat transfer. Existence of wall superheat gave rise to forming of vapor bubbles near the boiling temperature of the fluid, namely DI-Water.

40|$|Objectives and Methods: Contact angle, as a {{representative}} measure of surface wettability, is often employed to interpret contact lens surface properties. The literature is often contradictory {{and can lead to}} confusion. This literature review is part of a series regarding the analysis of hydrogel contact lenses using contact angle techniques. Here we present an overview of contact angle terminology, methodology, and analysis. Having discussed this background material, subsequent parts of the series will discuss the analysis of contact lens contact angles and evaluate differences in published laboratory results. Results: The concepts of contact angle, wettability and wetting are presented as an introduction. Contact angle hysteresis is outlined and highlights the advantages in using dynamic analytical techniques over static methods. The surface free energy of a material illustrates how contact angle analysis is capable of providing supplementary surface characterization. Although single values are able to distinguish individual material differences, surface free energy and dynamic methods provide an improved understanding of material behavior. The frequently used sessile drop, captive <b>bubble,</b> and Wilhelmy <b>plate</b> techniques are discussed. Their use as both dynamic and static methods, along with {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each technique, is explained. Conclusions: No single contact angle technique fully characterizes the wettability of a material surface, and the application of complimenting methods allows increased characterization. At present, there is not an ISO standard method designed for soft materials. It is important that each contact angle technique has a standard protocol, as small protocol differences between laboratories often contribute to a variety of published data that are not easily comparable...|$|R
40|$|Pseudo-two-dimensional (2 D) foams are {{commonly}} used in foam studies as it is experimentally easier to measure the bubble size distribution and other geometric and topological properties of these foams {{than it is for}} a 3 D foam. Despite the widespread use of 2 D foams in both simulation and experimental studies, many important geometric and topological relationships are still not well understood. Film size, for example, is a key parameter in the stability of bubbles and the overall structure of foams. The relationship between the size distribution of the films in a foam and that of the bubbles themselves is thus a key relationship in the modeling and simulation of unstable foams. This work uses structural simulation from Surface Evolver to statistically analyze this relationship and to ultimately formulate a relationship for the film size in 2 D foams that is shown to be valid across a wide range of different bubble polydispersities. These results and other topological features are then validated using digital image analysis of experimental pseudo- 2 D foams produced in a vertical Hele–Shaw cell, which contains a monolayer of <b>bubbles</b> between two <b>plates.</b> From both the experimental and computational results, it is shown that there is a distribution of sizes that a film can adopt and that this distribution is very strongly dependent on the sizes of the two bubbles to which the film is attached, especially the smaller one, but that it is virtually independent of the underlying polydispersity of the foam...|$|R
40|$|High quality {{observations}} of mesoscopic gas bubbles in liquid metal are vital {{for a further}} development of pyrometallurgical gas injection reactors. The opacity of metals however enforces the use of indirect imaging techniques with limited temporal or spatial resolution. In addition, accurate interface tracking requires tomography which further complicates {{the design of a}} high temperature experimental setup. In this paper an alternative approach is suggested that circumvents these two main restrictions. By injecting gas in a thin layer of liquid metal entrapped between two flat and closely spaced <b>plates,</b> <b>bubbles</b> in a Hele-Shaw flow regime are generated. The resulting quasi- 2 D multiphase flow phenomena can be fully captured from a single point of view and, when using a non-wetted transparent <b>plate</b> material, the <b>bubbles</b> can be observed directly. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by observations on buoyancy driven nitrogen bubbles in liquid mercury in a vertical Hele-Shaw cell. By using a moving high speed camera to make continuous close up recordings of individual bubbles, the position and geometry of these bubbles are quantified with a high resolution along their entire path. After a thorough evaluation of the experimental accuracy, this information is used for a detailed analysis of the bubble expansion along the path. While the observed bubble growth is mainly caused by the hydrostatic pressure gradient, a careful assessment of the volume variations for smaller bubbles shows that an accurate bubble description should account for significant dynamic pressure variations that seem to be largely regime dependent. status: publishe...|$|R

Researchers have made of use vibrations, temperature, and other environmental stimuli. In this thesis, transpiration is researched as a mechanism for mechanical and electrical energy conversion. Two energy scavenging devices inspired by the transpiration mechanism in plants were developed and tested. The first is a class of mechanical actuators that operate via the evaporation of water to generate forces per unit length of 5. 75 - 67. 75 mN/m, angular rotations of 330 o and tip deflections of 3. 5 mm. The actuators were also studied {{as a way to}} achieve bottom-up self assembly by programming deflection profiles into materials using geometric parameters. These actuators can be used in applications for an evaporation-powered and controlled self-assembly of micro components. The experimental work is coupled with the development of an accurate theoretical model based on the principle of virtual work. The second type of devices developed in this thesis use an evaporation-induced flow within leaf-like microvasculature networks to drive the movement of gas <b>bubbles</b> through capacitor <b>plates.</b> This motion allows the charge pumping of an energy conversion circuit. Evaporation-driven flow was enhanced by using porous materials at the fluidic channel outlets to achieve a maximum flow velocity of 1. 5 cm/s. Changes in capacitance measured at 1 MHz were between 8 - 10 pF and greater than 30 pF at lower frequencies for each bubble. Current generated by capacitance change was measured to reach up to 1 nA. Using the conversion circuit, voltage outputs up to 5 microvolts were measured for each water to air interface. A theoretical bound of the scavenged power density was calculated {{as a function of the}} size of the storage capacitor. Theoretical analysis and simulation results are presented to describe how the circuit can be modified to suit the energy harvesting application.

An experimental relation between the static contact angle θeq and stone density ρ was obtained in the form θeq = Bρ + C, where B = 12. 23 ± 0. 92, C = - (19. 17 ± 0. 77), and r 2 = 0. 92. The histogram of θeq distribution for polished stone plates exhibited a multimodal feature indicating that the most abundant solid materials (hydrophilic in nature) have contact angles θeq = 7. 2, 10. 7, 15. 7 and 19. 2 º, which appear to be applicable to unspecified field stones as well. The contact angle, a pH-dependent quantity, {{appears to be a}} sensitive measure of stone grain size, e. g. granite. The captive bubble method gives reproducible results in studies of porous and highly hydrophilic surfaces such as stones and wood. The authors consider the adsorption of natural sea water surfactants on stone surfaces to be the process responsible for contact angle hysteresis. In the model, an equation was derived for determining the solid surface free energy from the liquid's surface tension γLV it also enabled the advancing θA and receding θR contact angles of this liquid to be calculated. Measurements of contact angle hysteresis Δθ (=θA - θR) with surfactant-containing sea water and distilled water (reference) on the same stone surfaces allowed the film pressure ΔΠ (1. 22 to 8. 80 mJ m- 2), solid surface free energy ΔγS (- 17. 03 to - 23. 61 mJ m- 2) and work done by spreading ΔWS (- 1. 23 to - 11. 52 mJ m- 2) to be determined. The variability in these parameters is attributed to autophobing, an effect operative on a solid surface covered with an adsorptive layer of surfactants. The wetting behaviour of solid particles is of great importance in numerous technological processes including froth flotation, demulgation, anti-foaming procedures and the coal industries. It is believed that the approach presented here and the examples of its application to common sea water/solid mineral systems could be successfully adapted to optimise several surfactant-mediated adsorption processes (see below) of practical value in natural water ecology...|$|R

The temperature was regulated between investigated range 35, 55 and 75 oC using immiscible heating probe. A pH meter was used to measure the pH value of the solution and pH was manipulated using 120 g/L of sulphuric acid and 2 M sodium hydroxide to maintain pH 4. Investigations to apprehend the effects of impurities were carried out at standard cobalt electrowinning conditions with only cobalt concentration maintained at low values to support the effort of the study. A 20 g/L cobaltous sulphate was prepared together with 120 g/L sulphuric acid, 20 g/L boric acid, and operation conditions were maintained at 450 A/m² current density, temperature of 50 °C and a pH of 4. Investigated impurities considered in this study were zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) respectively; both impurities were introduced into the cell at concentrations of 50 ppm and 100 ppm each. Though impurities have an effect on cobalt electrowinning, more of their effects were evident in the cobalt deposition morphology, quality and current efficiency. This rather suggests that there's opposition for the available potential, the SEC-CCS set-up proved to be optimistic. The perpetual fluid flow pattern and electrochemical reaction surface requires steady flow of fluid at moderate pressure. This will continuously supply fresh feed and consequently the rate of mass transport adequate, adversely increasing fluid flow results in decrease in current efficiency, and rather cause high energy consumption. This statement is supported by insignificant effects of the flow rate on imperative cobalt electrowinning parameters such as cathodic overpotential, cell potential, energy consumption and current efficiency. The effects of temperature changes are observed to have significant effect on current efficiency and energy consumption. The cathodic overpotentials of cobalt electrowinning decreases with an increase in temperature and the transfer coefficients rather favors high temperature operation for cobalt electrowinning, however this conditions influences reductions in the current efficiency and adversely lowers the cathode deposition quality. The positive attribute of the SEC-CCS system in the cobalt electrowinning is that it minimized pitting and peeling as hydrogen <b>bubbles</b> of the <b>plate</b> surface and this somewhat increases the quality of the metal deposit morphology, and rather has insignificant attributes to electrowinning parameter...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{injection}} reactors in general, and bubble column reactors in particular, are {{key elements}} of many pyrometallurgical flow charts. Nevertheless, the phenomena and interactions that govern these reactors are not yet fully understood. From a multiscale point of view, the main bottleneck is situated at a mesoscopic level on which individual bubbles are considered. While simulations and water models can be very helpful to widen this bottleneck, experimental observations of gas bubbles in real pyrometallurgical systems remain indispensable for validation and fine-tuning of mesoscopic system descriptions. Unfortunately, the opacity of these systems enforces the use of indirect imaging techniques with limited temporal or spatial resolution. In addition, accurate tracking of the gas-liquid interface requires tomography, further complicating the design of an experimental setup. In this doctoral study an alternative and innovative approach is suggested that circumvents these two main restrictions. By injecting gas in a thin sheet of liquid entrapped between two flat and closely spaced <b>plates,</b> <b>bubbles</b> in a Hele-Shaw flow regime are generated. The resulting quasi-two-dimensional multiphase flow phenomena can be fully captured from a single point of view. Moreover, when using a transparent plate material that is not wetted by the liquid, even bubbles in opaque liquids can be visualized directly. This approach is explored for inert gas injection in liquid metals. To demonstrate the feasibility of the suggested Hele-Shaw based approach, buoyancy driven nitrogen bubbles in liquid mercury are observed at room temperature in a Hele-Shaw cell of 1 mm thickness. By using a moving high speed camera to make continuous close up recordings of individual bubbles, the position and geometry of these bubbles are quantified with a high resolution along their entire path. After a thorough evaluation of the experimental accuracy, this information is used for {{a detailed analysis of}} bubble volume variations. It is clear that a hydrostatic pressure gradient accounts for the most of the observed bubble growth. Yet, a careful assessment of the variations for smaller bubbles suggests that an accurate bubble description should also account for significant dynamic pressure variations that are largely flow regime dependent. Contrary to aqueous systems, in mercury transitions between these regimes can readily be observed along the trajectory of individual, expanding bubbles. A mapping for bubbles with diameters between 4 mm and 20 mm shows the existence of two different regimes: smaller bubbles adopt a constant round-to-elliptical shape and travel along a linear path while larger bubbles exhibit a periodically distorted shape and follow a swirling trajectory. The transition between this linear and periodic regime can be attributed to a shift from capillary to inertia dominated flow with increasing bubble size. Furthermore, a quantitative mapping of the bubble velocity shows that the transition {{goes hand in hand with}} a steep acceleration, and that the linear regime is marked by a negative correlation between the Eötvös number and the Reynolds number while the opposite is true for the periodic regime. To demonstrate the applicability of the suggested Hele-Shaw based approach for industrially relevant systems, a high-temperature experimental setup is developed. With this setup, nitrogen bubbles are observed in liquid zinc at 700 &# 176;C in a fused quartz cell with a thickness of 1. 5 mm. At low oxygen levels, cell walls are not wetted by the liquid zinc and bubbles can be visualized directly through the transparent cell walls, using the same moving high speed camera as for mercury. In the range of diameters between 5. 9 and 9. 0 mm, this reveals a single periodic flow regime in which bubbles follow a sinusoidal path with a characteristic frequency of 3. 31 Hz. In addition, systematic intermediate accelerations are observed of which the exact origin remains unexplained. A direct extrapolation of the observations in a Hele-Shaw cell to industrially relevant geometries is not straightforward. As a consequence, such experiments will never be able to completely replace three-dimensional observations. Nevertheless, the suggested approach seems very promising as a first step in the study of gas bubbles in liquid metals. After all, in a Hele-Shaw cell, the same effects and interactions that govern unconfined bubbles can be studied. In addition, the resolution of the observations is unseen for bubbles in liquid metals, especially at high temperatures. This makes them highly suitable for detailed validations of simulation results. Therefore it is expected that this approach can contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern gas injection in pyrometallurgy and support future developments in this field. nrpages: 144 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{enhanced}} surfaces {{became one}} of the most popular studies in order to increase heat transfer performances of microsystems. There are various techniques/processes applied to surfaces to enhance excess heat removal from microsystems. In parallel to these research efforts, various micro and nano structured surfaces were evaluated in channel flow, jet impingement and pool boiling applications. In the first study, single micro pin-fins having the same chord thickness/diameter but different shapes are numerically modeled to assess their heat transfer and hydraulic performances for Reynolds number values changing between 20 and 140. The pin-fins are three dimensionally modeled based on a one-to-one scale and their heat transfer performances are evaluated using commercially available software COMSOL Multiphysics 3. 5 a. Navier-Stokes equations along with continuity and energy equations are solved under steady state conditions for weakly compressible and single-phase water flows. To increase the computational efficiency, half of the domain consisting of a micro pin-fin located inside a micro channel, is modeled using a symmetry plane. To validate the model, experimental data available in the literature are compared to simulation results obtained from the model of the same geometrical configuration as the experimental one. Accordingly, the numerical and experimental results show a good agreement. Furthermore, performance evaluation study is performed using 3 D numerical models in the light of flow morphologies around micro pin-fins of various shapes. According to the results obtained from this study, the rectangular-shaped micro pin fin configuration has the highest Nusselt number and friction factor over the whole Reynolds number range. However, the cone-shaped micro pin-fin configuration has the best thermal performance index indicating that it could be more preferable to use micro pin fins of non conventional shapes in micro pin fin heat sinks. In the second study, the results of a series of heat transfer experiments conducted on a compact electronics cooling device based on single and two phase jet impingement technique are reported. Deionized and degassed water is propelled into four microchannels of inner diameter 500 μm, which are used as nozzles and located at a nozzle to surface distance of 1. 5 mm. The generated jet impingement is targeted through these channels towards the surface of two nanostructured plates with different surface morphologies placed inside a liquid pool filled with deionized-water. The size of these nanostructured plates is 35 mm x 30 mm and they are composed of copper nanorods grown on top of a silicon wafer substrate of thickness 350 μm coated with a 50 nm thick copper thin film layer (i. e. Cu-nanorod/Cu-film/Silicon-wafer). Nanorods were grown using the sputter glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique. First type of nanostructured plates incorporates 600 nm long vertically aligned copper nanorod arrays grown with nanorod diameters and spacing varying between 50 - 100 and 20 - 100 nm, respectively. The second type incorporates 600 nm long tilted copper nanorod arrays grown with diameter values varying between 50 - 100 nm and spacing in the range of 20 - 50 nm. Heat removal characteristics induced through jet impingement are investigated using the nanostructured plates and compared to the results obtained from a plain surface plate of copper thin film coated on silicon wafer surface. Heat generated by small scale electronic devices is simulated using four cylindrical aluminum cartridge heaters of 6. 25 mm diameter and 31. 75 mm length placed inside an aluminum base. Surface temperatures are recorded by a data acquisition system with four thermocouples integrated on the surface at various prescribed locations. Constant heat flux provided by the heaters is delivered to the nanostructured plate placed on top of the base. Volumetric flow rate and heat flux values are varied between 107. 5 - 181. 5 ml/min and 1 - 40 W/cm 2, respectively, in order to characterize the potential enhancement in heat transfer by nanostructured surfaces thoroughly. A single phase average heat transfer enhancement of 22. 4 % and a two phase average heat transfer enhancement of 85. 3 % has been realized using the nanostructured plate with vertical nanorods compared to flat plate. This enhancement is attributed to the increased heat transfer surface area and the single crystal property of the vertical Cu nanorods. On the other hand, nanostructured plate with tilted nanorods has shown poorer heat transfer performance compared to both the nanostructured plate with vertical nanorods and plain surface plate in the experiments performed. The lower heat transfer rate of the tilted Cu nanorods is believed to be due to the decreased supply of liquid jets to the base of the plate caused by their tilted orientation and closely spaced dense array structure. This leads to formation of air gaps that ultimately become trapped among the tilted nanorods, which results in reduced heat transfer surface area and increased resistance to heat transfer. In addition, non-single crystal structure of the tilted nanorods and resulting enhanced surface oxidation could further decrease their heat transfer performance. In the third study, a nanostructure based compact pool boiler cooling system consisting of an aluminum base housing the heaters, a pool and four different plates to change the surface texture of the pool is designed. Effects of nanostructured plates of different surface morphologies on boiling heat transfer performance of the system are studied. Three nanostructured plates featuring Si nanowires of diameter 850 nm and of three different lengths, 900 nm, 1800 nm and 3200 nm respectively, which are etched through single crystal p-type silicon wafers using metal assisted chemical etching (MaCE), are utilized to enhance the pool boiling heat transfer. A plain surface Si plate is used as the control sample. Constant heat flux is provided to the liquid within the pool on the surface of the aluminum base through the plate by boiling heat transfer. Existence of wall superheat gave rise to forming of vapor bubbles near the boiling temperature of the fluid, namely DI-Water. Bubbles emerged from the nanostructured plate along with the phase change. Nucleate boiling on the surface of the <b>plate,</b> <b>bubble</b> formation and bubble motion inside the pool created an effective heat removal mechanism from the heated surface to the liquid pool. Along with the enhancement in both boiling and single-phase region heat transfer coefficients, this study proves the ability of nanostructured plates in improving the performance of the cooling system...|$|R
