40|$|Abstract. An {{instance}} of the path hitting problem consists of two families of paths, D and H, in a common undirected graph, where each path in H {{is associated with a}} non-negative cost. We refer to D and H as the sets of demand and hitting paths, respectively. When p ∈ H and q ∈ D share at least one mutual edge, we say that p hits q. The objective is to find a minimum cost subset of H whose members collectively hit those of D. In this paper we provide constant factor approximation algorithms for path hitting, confined to instances in which the underlying graph is a tree, a spider, or a star.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{considers}} some {{extensions of}} the <b>basic</b> <b>covering</b> set location problem. The purpose of the covering set location models is to select a set of facilities (public facilities, antennas, etc.) to be implemented {{in order to satisfy}} {{all or part of the}} demand of a given area. A facility has a constant coverage radius R and a demand point is covered if it is within a distance R of an established facility. We introduce a new type of model, in which we take into account: the costs incurred to establish a facility and the costs incurred if a demand point is not covered or covered by more than one facility. We introduce some properties of an optimal solution and derive heuristic algorithms and a branch and bound method from these properties. Numerical examples illustrate this approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss some recent generalizations of the <b>basic</b> <b>covering</b> radius problem in coding theory. In {{particular}} we discuss multiple coverings, multiple coverings of the farthest-off points and weighted coverings. 1 Introduction There are evident parallels between problems in design theory and coding theory. In design theory (see, e. g., [3] and extensive list of references therein) we study k-element subsets and the covering relation is defined as set-theoretic inclusion. In coding theory we deal with binary n-tuples and we say that one vector covers another if their Hamming distance (the number of coordinates in which they differ from each other) does not exceed some prescribed number. We see that the following pairs of problems are equivalent up to the choice of the covering relationship and the set of the objects considered: Steiner systems $ Perfect codes Designs $ Perfect multiple coverings Covering designs $ Covering codes and multiple coverings The purp [...] ...|$|E

We refer to D and H as the sets of demand and hitting paths, respectively. When p ∈ H and q ∈ D share at least one mutual edge, we say that p hits q.

Although such restricted settings may appear to be very simple, we demonstrate that they still capture some of the most <b>basic</b> <b>covering</b> problems in graphs. Our approach combines several novel ideas: We extend the algorithm of Garg, Vazirani and Yannakakis [Algorithmica, 18 : 3 – 20, 1997] for approximate multicuts and multicommodity flows in trees to prove new integrality properties; we present a reduction that involves multiple calls to this extended algorithm; and we introduce a polynomial-time solvable variant of the edge cover problem, which may be of independent interest. ...|$|E
40|$|The topological {{product of}} a normal space with a metrizable space is not normal in general, {{as has been shown}} {{recently}} by E. lVIichael [1]. In a previous paper [4) 1) Vie have introduced the notion of P-spaces, and established that a necessary and sufficient condition for a normal space X to possess the property that the product space X X Y is normal for any metrizable space Y is that X be a P-space.

Electron-phonon interactions have been shown to be relevant in high-temperature superconductors and colossal magnetoresistance oxides, and transport through nanowires and quantum dots also often depends on vibronic displacements of ions. The continued interest in polarons extends beyond physical description of advanced materials. The field has been a testing ground for analytical, semi-analytical, and numerical techniques, such as path integrals, strong-coupling perturbation expansion, advanced variational, exact diagonalization, density-matrix renormalization group, dynamic mean-field, and quantum Monte Carlo techniques. Single and multi-polaron theories have offered a new insight in our understanding of high-temperature superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, and the correlated transport through molecular quantum dots.
