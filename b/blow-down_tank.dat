40|$|In {{the present}} paper the work {{performed}} to validate the ENEL/EDF ECART code {{on the base of}} a series of experimental tests performed in the Japanese ICE facility is presented. This activity has been carried out in the general framework of the validation phase of the ECART code, initially developed for integrated analysis of severe accidents in LWRs, for its application on incidental sequences related to fusion plants. The ICE facility consists of the cylindrical vacuum vessel, at horizontal axis (900. mm of external diameter and 600. mm length), the boiler, the <b>blow-down</b> <b>tank</b> and the corresponding piping and valves. The vessel has heat plates to maintain the required wall temperatures and initially contains dry air at a sub-atmospheric pressure of about 100. Pa. The employed ECART code full-couples the aerosol-vapour transport phenomena with thermal-hydraulics and chemical equilibrium. For the present work purposes, due to the ICE tests characteristics, only the thermal-hydraulic code section was activated and the dry aerosol or the chemical equilibrium modules were not employed. Two different conclusions have been highlighted by the work. The first one, being the main goal of the work, is related to the assessment of the ECART code in experimental conditions relevant for the future fusion reactors, against the traditional LWRs assessment previously performed for this code. The second one is related to the evaluation of the ICE experimental tests...|$|E
