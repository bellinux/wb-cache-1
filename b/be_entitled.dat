5|$|A week later, {{plans for}} an as yet unnamed second {{documentary}} about compulsive male masturbators were announced, to be produced by the independent company Spun Gold. The film was to be an hour long and focus on men trying to cut down excessive masturbatory habits of up to twenty times a day, using methods developed in the United States. In September 2006, the final film in the series was announced. Entitled Masturbation For Girls, it was also to be produced by Spun Gold, and focus on female masturbation. It was to feature the sex educationalist Dr Betty Dodson, although the format had yet not been finalised. It was reported after the postponement of their airing that {{the second and third}} films were to <b>be</b> <b>entitled</b> I Can't Stop Wanking and Masturbation for Women respectively.|$|E
5|$|Princesses and princes of the United Kingdom are {{provided}} with distinctive forms of coronet, which they don during the service. A male heir-apparent's coronet displays four crosses-pattée alternating with four fleurs-de-lis, surmounted by an arch. The same style, without the arch, is used by other children and siblings of the monarch. The coronets of children of the heir-apparent display four fleurs-de-lis, two crosses-pattée and two strawberry leaves. A fourth style, including four crosses-pattée and four strawberry leaves, {{is used for the}} children of the sons and brothers of sovereigns. The aforementioned coronets are borne in place of those to which they might otherwise <b>be</b> <b>entitled</b> as peers or peeresses.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{was allowed}} to elect sixteen {{representative}} peers, while Ireland could elect twenty-eight. Those chosen by Scotland sat for a single term, and following each dissolution new Scottish peers were elected. In contrast, Irish representative peers sat for life. Elections for Irish peers ceased when the Irish Free State came into existence as a Dominion in December 1922. However, already-elected Irish peers continued to <b>be</b> <b>entitled</b> to sit until their death.

5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering. Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of the money would go directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not <b>be</b> <b>entitled</b> to a regular dividend, and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|E
5|$|The English {{judicial}} system had altered considerably {{over the previous}} century, with the royal judges playing {{a larger role in}} delivering justice across the country. John had used his royal discretion to extort large sums of money from the barons, effectively taking payment to offer justice in particular cases, {{and the role of the}} Crown in delivering justice had become politically sensitive among the barons. Clauses 39 and 40 demanded due process be applied in the royal justice system, while clause 45 required that the King appoint knowledgeable royal officials to the relevant roles. Although these clauses did not have any special significance in the original charter, this part of Magna Carta became singled out as particularly important in later centuries. In the United States, for example, the Supreme Court of California interpreted clause 45 in 1974 as establishing a requirement in common law that a defendant faced with the potential of incarceration <b>be</b> <b>entitled</b> to a trial overseen by a legally trained judge.|$|E
5|$|The royalists {{under the}} command of Prince Mohamed's {{objective}} was to cut the Egyptians' line and force them to withdraw. They intended to take over the garrisons along this line and establish positions from which they could interdict the Egyptian movement. They had prepared the attack {{with the help of the}} Nahm tribe, who tricked the Egyptians into believing that they were their allies and would take care of the mountain pass known as Wadi Humaidat themselves. The royalist deal was that the Nahm would <b>be</b> <b>entitled</b> to loot the ambushed Egyptians. The Egyptians may have suspected something was up, as they sent a reconnaissance aircraft over the area a day before the attack. The royalists thus occupied two mountains known as Asfar and Ahmar and installed 75-mm guns and mortars overlooking the wadi. On April 15, the day after the last Egyptian convoy went through, the royalists launched a surprise attack. Both forces numbered at only a couple of thousands. The guns positioned on Asfar and Ahmar opened fire, and then the Nahm came out from behind the rocks. Finally, Prince Mohamed's troops followed. This time, the royalists' operation was fully coordinated by radio. Some of the Egyptians surrendered without resistance, others fled to Harah 800 yards to the north. Both sides brought reinforcements and the battle shifted between Harf and Hazm.|$|E
