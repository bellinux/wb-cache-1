40|$|Abstract: It is a {{frequent}} occurrence in urban traffic- a low-speed collision in which one vehicle hits the back of another. The vehicles often sustain expensive damage. Bumpers can reduce this damage, but only line up so the initial contact in an impact is bumper to bumper. Then the bumpers on the colliding vehicles have to absorb the crash energy, keeping damage away from expensive sheet metal, lights, and other components. In real world accidents, Bumper mismatches in crashes are increasing, and the resulting repair costs from low-speed collisions are escalating. In this study, we investigated the <b>bumper</b> <b>rail</b> height and analyzed their effects on repair cost. Futhermore, Our 16 kph front-into-rear crash tests demonstrates bumper mismatch problem...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{occupant}} injury severity in frontal pole impact, {{this paper}} conducted a computer simulation {{study on the}} frontal pole impact of passenger car. Three types of frontal pole impact FE analysis models were developed according to different impact positions of pole, i. e., no offset, 25 %, and 35 % left offset relative to the centerline of vehicle. In order to illustrate the characteristics of frontal pole impact, this paper analyzed the impact parameters such as the structure deformation, crash force transmission path and acceleration of car body. The {{results show that the}} frontal pole impact was a severe loading condition leading to serious damage to vehicle structure. When it comes to the damage of vehicle, the 35 % left offset frontal pole impact mode was the worst whereas the center frontal pole impact mode was the best. The crashworthiness of frontal pole impact could be improved by strengthen <b>bumper,</b> <b>rail,</b> sub-frame and firewall...|$|E

40|$|Currently {{the extent}} of {{technology}} in math textbooks is limited to static, online e-books with occasional use of interactive software within the homework {{at the end of}} a chapter. The e-book is simply a digital version of the traditional textbook, providing only a passive reading experience. A consequence of page-after-page of static content is that students often skip the reading altogether and go directly to the homework. Homework often has interactive components where students attempt to learn through repetition or by “reverse engineering” the solutions. However, the interactive technology used in online homework is at the back-end of the learning process. We have attempted to move that technology to the front-end of the learning process to build an active reading experience. In our book, students complete online activities where they manipulate graphs, interact with tables, read and answer questions while getting immediate feedback from the book at almost every step. Questions and feedback in each activity are provided through WeBWorK, an open-source online homework system, and dynamic graphs are rendered in GeoGebra. Each activity is a guided, interactive, discovery-based approach to the lesson. It is the equivalent of having <b>bumper</b> <b>rails</b> while following a path in the dark. This book is written for today’s student, who may work full-time or have children to care for, all while managing a full load of classes. In our approach, we imagine that student sitting down at the end of the day to do their homework, faced with chapters of math content and no instructor around to help when they get stuck. They wonder, “Am I doing this right?” We believe our book will increase access to learning and will ease the financial burden of attending college as it provides immediate support outside of class and it is cost-free to students...|$|R

Goodyear uses it in making tires for automotive and aerospace and also uses a customized CATIA for its design and development. Many automotive companies use CATIA for car structures - door beams, IP supports, <b>bumper</b> beams, roof <b>rails,</b> side rails, body components because of CATIA's capabilities in Computer representation of surfaces. Bombardier Transportation of Canada is using this software to design its entire fleet of Train engines and coaches. Webasto uses CATIA to design its roof.|$|R
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} was significantly revised including a widened track, softer torsion bars {{and the addition}} of a unique Z-configuration equalizing torsion spring. On US, UK and Ireland models, the generator output was increased from 180 to 360 watts, and the entire electrical system was upgraded from 6 volts to 12 volts. The clutch disc also increased in size and changes were made to the flywheel. New equipment included a driver's armrest on the door and locking buttons on both doors. Safety improvements included two-speed windscreen wipers, reversing lights (in some markets), and a driver's side mirror. In accord with the newly enacted US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, North American models received a dual-circuit brake system, the clear glass headlamp covers were deleted; the headlamps were brought forward to {{the leading edge of the}} front fenders, and the sealed-beam units were exposed and surrounded by chrome bezels. (Throughout the rest of the world markets the 1967 model sold in Europe et.al. still retained the older headlights (including its counterparts in Latin America - especially the Brasilian market model retaining the pre-1965 bodystyle). Another oddity of the 1967 North American market Beetle is the rear <b>bumper</b> overriders (towel <b>rails)</b> - the overriders have a different shape unlike the older models besides the one-year only engine decklid.|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Crashworthiness {{design is}} gaining more {{importance}} in the automotive industry due to high competition and tight safety norms. Further {{there is a need}} for light weight structures in the automotive design. Structural optimization in last two decades have been widely explored to improve existing designs or conceive new designs with better crashworthiness and reduced mass. Although many gradient based and heuristic methods for topology and topometry based crashworthiness design are available these days, most of them result in stiff structures that are suitable only for a set of vehicle components in which maximizing the energy absorption or minimizing the intrusion is the main concern. However, there are some other components in a vehicle structure that should have characteristics of both stiffness and flexibility. Moreover, the load paths within the structure and potential buckle modes also play an important role in efficient functioning of such components. For example, the front <b>bumper,</b> side frame <b>rails,</b> steering column, and occupant protection devices like the knee bolster should all exhibit controlled deformation and collapse behavior. This investigation introduces a methodology to design dynamically crushed thin-walled tubular structures for crashworthiness applications. Due to their low cost, high energy absorption efficiency, and capacity to withstand long strokes, thin-walled tubular structures are extensively used in the automotive industry. Tubular structures subjected to impact loading may undergo three modes of deformation: progressive crushing/buckling, dynamic plastic buckling, and global bending or Euler-type buckling. Of these, progressive buckling is the most desirable mode of collapse because it leads to a desirable deformation characteristic, low peak reaction force, and higher energy absorption efficiency. Progressive buckling is generally observed under pure axial loading; however, during an actual crash event, tubular structures are often subjected to oblique impact loads in which Euler-type buckling is the dominating mode of deformation. This undesired behavior severely reduces the energy absorption capability of the tubular structure. The design methodology presented in this paper relies on the ability of a compliant mechanism to transfer displacement and/or force from an input to desired output port locations. The suitable output port locations are utilized to enforce desired buckle zones, mitigating the natural Euler-type buckling effect. The problem addressed in this investigation is to find the thickness distribution of a thin-walled structure and the output port locations that maximizes the energy absorption while maintaining the peak reaction force at a prescribed limit. The underlying design for thickness distribution follows a uniform mutual potential energy density under a dynamic impact event. Nonlinear explicit finite element code LS-DYNA is used to simulate tubular structures under crash loading. Biologically inspired hybrid cellular automaton (HCA) method is used to drive the design process. Results are demonstrated on long straight and S-rail tubes subject to oblique loading, achieving progressive crushing in most cases...|$|R
