40|$|A {{heritage}} wine-rack thermal/mechanical {{design for}} the nickel-hydrogen batteries was the baseline at the Landsat- 7 Preliminary Design Review. An integrated thermal and power analysis of the batteries performed by the author in 1994 revealed that the maximum cell-to-cell gradient was 6. 6 C. The author proposed modifying the heritage wine-rack design by enhancing heat conduction from cells to cells, and from cells to <b>battery</b> <b>frame.</b> At the 1995 Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference (IECEC), the author presented a paper on methods of modifying the wine-rack design. It showed that the modified wine-rack option, which uses a metallic filler, could reduce the maximum cell-to-cell temperature gradient to 1. 30 C, and could also reduce the maximum cell temperature {{by as much as}} 80 C. That design concept was adopted by the Landsat 7 Project Office, and a design change was made at the Critical Design Review. Results of the spacecraft thermal vacuum and thermal balance tests, and temperature data in flight show that the temperatures of the battery cells are very uniform. The maximum cell-to-cell gradient is 1. 50 C. They validate the modified wine-rack thermal design...|$|E

5000|$|The {{prototype}} Solution F/Chretien Helicopter is a coaxial rotor [...] "hang" [...] helicopter [...] Pitch {{and roll}} {{are controlled by}} weight shift. The entire rotor is tilted {{in relation to the}} suspended airframe to shift the center of gravity, thus no cyclic control is required. These features were generally implemented on the demonstrator for simplicity and expedience and were incidental to the research and demonstration goals. Yaw is controlled by differential torque applied to the two rotors. The two rotors are each driven by a separate 20 KW electric motor. Power is supplied by twenty one, 106 AH Li-ion Polymer cells with a power density of 160 WH/Kg. The unique cooling solution developed for the pack allows 500 Amps to be delivered for 10 minutes, while keeping the <b>battery</b> pack’s <b>frame</b> and cooling system down to less than 5% of the pack cell weight.|$|R

5000|$|During the Edo {{period and}} Meiji period, {{the act of}} {{carrying}} a large lantern float like the Nebuta was often banned by the government due to the potential fire hazard it posed to the surroundings. This ban was also put into place during World War II, but was lifted in 1944 {{as an effort to}} boost morale during the waning years of the war. Corporations began to sponsor the creation of the floats in the post-war period, and a strong emphasis was placed in expanding local tourism through the festival. The light source within the float was originally a candle, but was eventually changed to incandescent or fluorescent light bulbs powered by portable generators and rechargeable <b>batteries.</b> The <b>frame</b> of the floats also changed from bamboo to wire, lowering the risk of fire considerably. Nebuta floats also grew larger with time, but urban obstacles such as footbridges, power lines, and traffic lights only allowed their width to increase significantly.

5000|$|The {{optional}} MB-10 battery grip {{which takes}} 4 AA batteries and which fits {{on to the}} base of the camera was also introduced. The MB-10 added a vertical-grip shutter release and provides a larger grip area which is especially useful when a large lens is attached to the body. The MB-10 will fully work only on the F90x and N90s models. Plain N90 and F90 models will receive and mount the MB10, but the vertical shutter controls will not work as they lack the necessary internal electrical contacts in the battery chamber.As the MB-10 operates from exactly the same 4 [...] "AA" [...] cells as the camera body alone, there is no increase in continuous shooting speed or AF speed as in some cameras such as the F4 / F4S. The grip is simply a convenience and handling feature. The operational speed, <b>battery</b> duration and <b>frame</b> rate of the F90X remain identical either with or without the MB-10.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a dual-mode capsule gas-trointestinal endoscope device. An endoscope {{combined with a}} narrowband image (NBI), {{has been shown to}} be a superior diagnostic tool for early stage tissue neoplasms detection. Nev-ertheless, a wireless capsule endoscope with the narrowband imaging technology has not been presented in the market up to now. The narrowband image acquisition and power dissipation reduction are the main challenges of NBI capsule endoscope. In this paper, we present the first narrowband imaging capsule endo-scope that can assist clinical doctors to effectively diagnose early gastrointestinal cancers, profited from our dedicated dual-mode complementary metal–oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor. The dedicated dual-mode CMOS sensor can offer white-light and nar-rowband images. Implementation results show that the proposed 512 512 CMOS sensor consumes only 2 mA at a 3 -V power supply. The average current of the NBI capsule with an 8 -Mb/s RF transmitter is nearly 7 8 mA that can continuously work for 6 8 h with two 1. 5 -V 80 -mAh button <b>batteries</b> while the <b>frame</b> rate is 2 fps.

40|$|Pedestrians are {{the most}} {{vulnerable}} road users and crash statistics implies that continuous efforts are needed to reduce the causalities and mitigate their effects; both in passive and active safety. Current thesis {{is an attempt to}} provide a FE model which can be utilized for the analysis of the pedestrian kinematics. The author has focused on the bonnet modeling in LS-DYNA; furthermore, the modeling task was developed to provide the model of other influencing components in vehicle’s front end namely: fenders, engine cover, <b>battery</b> cover and <b>frame.</b> Through the use of GeoMagic studio, CATIA, HyperMesh, LS-Prepost and LS-DYNA, the FE models of all previously cited parts are prepared respectively. To investigate the response of the model to head and torso impacts, Euro-NCAP Head-form impacts tests were simulated and the responses evaluated. Also a FE model of a rigid torso impactor is modeled in LS-DYNA based on a mechanical torso impactor designed at Autoliv and the simulation results were compared and evaluated with the impact tests performed at Autoliv. A first investigation deals with the response of the bonnet when exposed to different loads at different positions on the bonnet. It was found that the kinematics was influenced mainly by the stiffness of the collision point and particularly if the rigid parts were engaged in the impact {{and the size of the}} gap between the hood and the rigid components. A second study involves the comparison between the results of available experiments and those obtained in reconstruction of these experiments. Despite showing comparable peak acceleration and impact duration, the results indicated a significant discrepancy in terms of the shape and slope at the beginning of the impact. Finally, through the use of a parametric study, the effects of thickness, material, positioning tolerance, velocity tolerance, impactor angle and control shell part were investigated...|$|R
40|$|Multirotors such as {{the more}} famous quadcopter have been a favoured {{research}} object the last years. It is widely used as a ﬂying platform for the hobby enthusiasts, but recently also used more and more by the industry. The multirotor has complex dynamics and requires sensors and a control system in order to ﬂy. To get the desired ﬂight characteristics batteries, motor and the propeller have to be chosen wisely as different combinations create different properties. The usual design approach is to test different combinations of motors and propellers, and based on experience select components that will be closest to the desired ﬂight properties. This thesis presents an optimization method that calculates what hardware to use {{in order to get}} closest to the demanded properties. The method will only select from a given database, hence not returning a diameter and pitch of a propeller that are not available. A wide range of criteria can be optimized, examples are dynamics of the motor/propeller, ﬂight dynamics, ﬂight time, payload etc. The optimization routine will also calculate if the better choice is a quadcopter with four propellers, a hexacopter with six or an octocopter with eight propellers. The optimization is not trivial due to the non-linear characteristics of the propeller. A lot of experimental work was done to test the response of the propeller, both for acceleration and deceleration. Theory and experimental work show that the thrust response of the propeller can be more or less equal if the electronic speed controller controls the motor in a special mode. This mode also makes the response of the motor faster than normal. The new design is tested with a new approach for attitude estimation, and a controller operating directly with the result of the estimator. Most of the multirotors use a microcontroller with limited resources as the control system, hence the attitude and controller were designed speciﬁcally without time consuming trigonometric functions {{such as the}} sine and cosine. Overall, the methods and results presented in this thesis will aid the engineer when designing a multirotor system consisting of control system, mechanical <b>frame,</b> <b>battery,</b> actuators and propellers...|$|R
