5000|$|<b>Beclamide</b> (marketed as Chloracon, Hibicon, Posedrine, Nydrane, Seclar, {{and other}} names) {{is a drug}} that {{possesses}} anticonvulsant activity. [...] It is no longer used.|$|E
50|$|Administration is oral, {{though it}} has an {{unpleasant}} taste. It is quickly absorbed and elimination is renal and complete within 48 hours. <b>Beclamide</b> is possibly metabolized to 3-chloropropanoic acid in vivo, which binds to the GHB receptor.|$|E
40|$|The anti-aggressive {{effects of}} orally {{administered}} <b>beclamide</b> (N-Benzyl-β-chloropropionamide) {{have been studied}} in male albino mice which were individually isolated for a 28 -day period. <b>Beclamide</b> (50 – 250 mg kg− 1 p. o.) caused an overall dose-dependent increase in the attack onset latency, {{a reduction in the}} percentage of animals attacking and the mean number of attacks/animal for this model of aggression. In addition, the highest dose of <b>beclamide</b> (250 mg kg− 1 p. o.) did not significantly modify locomotor activity in mice. It was concluded that <b>beclamide</b> induced anti-aggressive effects at non-sedative doses. This anti-aggressive action was thought be at least partially mediated, through a beclamide-induced release of 5 -HT from presynaptic sites...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>beclamide</b> on {{regional}} brain monoamine levels and radioligand binding {{have been studied}} in rats. One hour oral pre-treatment with <b>beclamide</b> (400 mg kg- 1) increased rat striatal dopamine turnover by increasing the levels of its major metabolites (DOPAC and HVA) three-fold. Simultaneously the drug reduced the concentration of striatal dopamine by a similar factor, and the concentrations of 5 -hydroxytryptamine, (5 -HT), 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid, (5 -HIAA) and 3 -methoxytyramine in the striatum were reduced below the detection limits of the assay. In the frontal cortex, <b>beclamide</b> depleted the dopamine, 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA content whilst having no {{significant effect on the}} noradrenaline level. The concentrations of bioamines and their metabolites in the hypothalamus were unaffected by such acute <b>beclamide</b> treatment. In radioligand binding studies <b>beclamide</b> lacked affinity and failed to displace radioligands from alpha 2, beta, 5 -HT, 5 -HT 2 and dopamine D 2 sites in selective loci of the rat brain...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{effects of}} aminobeclamide (N-(p-aminobenzyl) -beta-chloropropionamide) on socially offensive behaviour {{has been studied}} and {{compared with those of}} the parent drug <b>beclamide</b> (N-benzyl-beta-chloropropionamide). Following oral administration in mice which had been individually housed for a 28 day period then paired with normal group-housed opponents, aminobeclamide and <b>beclamide</b> both produced significant and dose-related inhibition of socially offensive behaviour. Aminobeclamide (20 - 150 mg kg- 1 p. o.) and <b>beclamide</b> (50 - 250 mg kg- 1 p. o.) gave increased offense onset latency whilst {{at the same time they}} reduced the incidence of offense encounters/animal and decreased the group percentage of animals displaying offense behaviour. It is likely that both drugs have similar monoamine modifying effects though this animal study suggests that aminobeclamide is 1. 5 to 2. 7 times more potent than <b>beclamide</b> against socially offensive behaviour...|$|E
