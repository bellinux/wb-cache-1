25|$|Some {{problems}} {{that are expected to}} <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> this century, such as fresh water shortages, can alternatively be regarded as problems of energy supply. For example, in desalination stations, seawater can be purified through distillation or reverse osmosis. Nonetheless, these processes are energy intensive. Even if the first fusion stations are not competitive with alternative sources, fusion could still become competitive if large-scale desalination requires more power than the alternatives are able to provide.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critics argue}} {{that the lack of}} results arising from this {{investigation}} is the result of systemic racism. This was also believed to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> the case of Vancouver's missing women and the Robert Pickton murders. The issue of systemic racism in these cases is explored in Finding Dawn, the 2006 documentary by Christine Welsh whose film includes a section on the Highway of Tears victim Ramona Wilson, including interviews with family and community members. Often overlooked in reports on the Highway of Tears is the fact that over half of the missing women are First Nation.|$|E
25|$|In the west, the Pacific fog plays a {{dominant}} {{role in the}} climate of the Anderson Valley. Following {{the path of the}} Navarro River from the Pacific, the fogs drifts in an blankets the valley with low hanging cool air. Vineyards in these areas are often planted with cool-climate varieties like Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer and Riesling. At high elevations in Anderson Valley and nearby Mendocino Ridges beyond the fog's reach, these warmer pockets of lands will usually be planted with more warm climate varieties like Zinfandel. With the nearby Pacific bringing in a steady stream of moisture, rain during the harvest months can <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> this part of the county.|$|E

25|$|An issue {{likely to}} come into play will be a {{provision}} in the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-134), which places a US$200 million cap on the aggregate of all passengers' damage claims in a railroad accident against a passenger railroad, including punitive damages. Bloomberg News reported that this event would likely be the first legal test of this law, according to a former House rail committee staffer who helped write the law, who predicted that given the number of casualties, the cap is almost certainly going to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> pending litigation. An attorney representing two of the victims agreed, saying payouts could range from $5 million to $10 million per death or serious injury. Metrolink reportedly has insurance coverage totaling $150 million.|$|E
25|$|Since 2009 {{there have}} been {{widespread}} concerns from Chinese consumers particularly among the online community, who expressed that Volkswagen has {{failed to respond to}} complaints about defects in its DSG-equipped vehicles. Typical issues associated with 6-speed DSG include abnormal noise and inability to change gear; while issues associated with 7-speed DSG include abnormal noise, excessive shift shock, abnormal increase in engine RPM, flashing gear indicator on the dashboard as well as inability to shift to even-numbered gears. In March 2012 China’s quality watchdog the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) said that it had been in contact with Volkswagen (China) and urged the carmaker to probe the issues. In a survey held by Gasgoo.com (China) of 2,937 industry experts and insiders, 83% of respondents believed that the carmaker should consider a full vehicle recall. In March 2012 Volkswagen Group China admitted that there could <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> its seven-speed DSG gearboxes that may affect approximately 500,000 vehicles from its various subsidiaries in China. A software upgrade has since been offered for the affected vehicles in an attempt to repair the problem.|$|E
500|$|Using {{the first}} {{selection}} in the 1987 draft, the Buccaneers selected quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who {{had led the}} Miami Hurricanes to a 21–3 record in games he started. Looking to avoid {{a repeat of the}} previous year's disastrous selection of Bo Jackson, the Buccaneers signed Testaverde 16 days before the draft began. Owner Hugh Culverhouse wanted to take one last shot at building the Buccaneers into a successful franchise, and made sure that money would not <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> signing Testaverde. [...] In training camp, Testaverde failed to win the starting job over veteran Steve DeBerg, who coach Perkins felt gave the team a better chance to win. DeBerg was displaced for the fourth time, having played for the San Francisco 49ers when Joe Montana was drafted, the Denver Broncos when John Elway was traded for, and the Buccaneers when Steve Young was signed.|$|E

500|$|In December 1901, the MCC {{approved}} the scheme previously suggested—that the county captains should meet {{to discuss the}} fairness of suspected bowlers. It was proposed that any bowler who was judged to be unfair by a two-to-one majority of captains would be banned {{for at least a}} season. The MCC also recommended that the counties not play suspected bowlers and that any bowler called for throwing should be removed from the attack {{in the interests of the}} spirit of cricket. In the 1902 Wisden, Sydney Pardon wrote: [...] "Never in the last twenty years or more has there been so little unfair or doubtful bowling as in the season of 1901. Indeed the improvement was so marked as to make it clear that, if the captains stick to their guns, we shall soon be entirely free from the evil of which not very long ago it seemed impossible to get rid." [...] After 1901, there were only isolated incidents regarding illegal bowling actions until the Second World War, and throwing ceased to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> English cricket, in which no cricketer was no-balled for throwing between 1908 and 1952.|$|E
