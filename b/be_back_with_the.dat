500|$|In 1976, the Bruins offered Orr US$600,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) per season, but {{he would}} have to pass a {{physical}} examination at the start of each season's training camp. Only the first year's money was guaranteed. Eagleson was quoted at the time as saying, [...] "There is only one way that Bobby Orr will ever <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Bruins. And that's if Jeremy Jacobs asks him for another meeting and straightens out the whole situation. Otherwise he's gone." [...] Instead, Orr became a free agent, with Boston to receive compensation. Orr and Eagleson whittled down a list of potential teams to St. Louis and Chicago. Chicago offered a five-year guaranteed contract with the Black Hawks, and on June 8, 1976, he officially signed with the Black Hawks. The Bruins' general manager, Harry Sinden complained of tampering by the Black Hawks, and demanded that Chicago owner Bill Wirtz submit to a lie detector test. According to documents held by Orr, they had a valid case. Orr signed with the Black Hawks at a secret meeting in May 1976, prior to becoming a free agent.|$|E
