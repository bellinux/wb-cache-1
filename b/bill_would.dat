5|$|In a {{dramatic}} reading at the Grand Théâtre de Québec on September 6, {{the final version}} of the Sovereignty Bill was unveiled. The <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> be tabled in the National Assembly awaiting the result of the referendum.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{carried over into}} the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a {{distraction}} from the budget {{and should not be}} voted on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> pass. If passed, the amended <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on the <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that {{he does not want to}} force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the language is not changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E
5|$|In April of {{his first}} year in office, Maloney {{introduced}} the Creating Reliability for Our Producers Act, the Dam Safety Act, and the Disabled Veterans Red Tape Reduction Act. In October 2013, the House passed Maloney's Disabled Veterans Red Tape Reduction Act with near unanimous support. Maloney's <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> allow disabled veterans to have their medical examinations performed by physicians outside the Veterans Affairs system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bills</b> <b>would</b> be {{approved}} with the majorities {{required by law}} or the Constitution.|$|R
50|$|Tier 3 {{would apply}} to all medical and {{surgical}} issues considered luxury or cosmetic (examples are Lasik surgery or Botox treatments). Funding for Tier 3 would not be covered under this system (as is true in the current system) and all <b>bills</b> <b>would</b> go to the patient. However, <b>billing</b> <b>would</b> still be made through the web-based universal billing form discussed below.|$|R
60|$|If, on the contrary, the United States {{had more}} money to receive from England than to pay, there <b>would</b> be <b>bills</b> offered for {{a greater number of}} dollars than were wanted for remittance, and the price of <b>bills</b> <b>would</b> fall below par: a bill for $1,000 might be bought for {{somewhat}} less than $1,000, and <b>bills</b> <b>would</b> be said to be at a discount.|$|R
5|$|In February 2013, the Philippine Senate {{passed a}} bill declaring waling-waling (Vanda sanderiana) as the {{national}} flower alongside Sampaguita. A similar bill in the House of Representatives had already been passed in 2012. Normally, the <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> become law after being signed by the President. However, it was vetoed by President Benigno Aquino III. The veto did not grant the waling-waling as the second national flower due to the confusion that it would create.|$|E
5|$|In November 2009, Wright was {{sufficiently}} {{concerned that the}} Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> result in increased emissions that she publicly urged politicians three times not to adopt the National Government's legislation. She opposed the removal of a firm cap on emissions, the reduction of price incentives to reduce emissions, and the heavy subsidies from taxpayers granted to emissions-intensive industry and agriculture by the intensity-based allocation of free units.|$|E
5|$|On April 14, 2017, Representative Earl Blumenauer {{introduced}} the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity Act. This <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> replace the Cabinet {{as the body}} that, together with the Vice President, determines whether Section 4 should be invoked. Under the bill, an eleven-member commission would conduct {{an examination of the}} President when directed to do so by a concurrent resolution of the Congress.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bills</b> defense <b>would</b> {{intercept}} Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco 5 {{times in}} this game, as Flacco completed only 50% {{of his passes}} in the game. Despite the 5 turnovers, the game was still somewhat close, but the <b>Bills</b> <b>would</b> win the game 23-20.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Bills</b> <b>would</b> {{not lose}} another game to the Bengals until Week 4 of the 2011 NFL season.|$|R

5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behavior. The Lānai hookbill is only known to have eaten {{the fruit of the}} ōpuhe; however, it is unlikely that its unique <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> have developed to eat fruit, and {{it may have been a}} snail specialist. The hookbill has not been seen since 1918, and by 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into pineapple fields, destroying the bird’s habitat. The combination of habitat destruction and the introduction of feral cats and rats are thought to have led to the Lānai hookbill’s extinction.|$|E
5|$|Chances the <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> {{be passed}} ended in November 2004 when House Republicans in the Pennsylvania General Assembly {{decided not to}} bring the bill to a vote. Later that year, Governor Rendell {{released}} US$30 million from the Redevelopment Assistance Budget to Liberty Property Trust. Through the state's Department of Economic and Community Development, Comcast received US$12.75 million that included a US$4-million opportunity grant, US$6.75 million in job-creation tax credits, and US$2 million in job training assistance. Despite the failure to gain KOZ status, the project received US$42.75 million in financial incentives from the state.|$|E
5|$|During the transition, many {{or most of}} the {{employees}} of the IRS (105,978 in 2005) would face loss of employment. The Beacon Hill Institute estimate is that the federal government would be able to cut $8 billion from the IRS budget of $11.01 billion (in 2007), reducing the size of federal tax administration by 73%. In addition, income tax preparers (many seasonal), tax lawyers, tax compliance staff in medium-to-large businesses, and software companies which sell tax preparation software could face significant drops, changes, or loss of employment. The <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> maintain the IRS for three years after implementation before completely decommissioning the agency, providing employees time to find other employment.|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] The House Ways and Means Committee {{approved}} six bills {{related to}} the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. Separate <b>bills</b> <b>would</b> establish demonstration projects— one for public-private social impact partnerships, another for subsidized employment. Other <b>bills</b> <b>would</b> amend TANF to rein in some practices for meeting TANF state spending requirements, add the goal of reducing childhood poverty to TANF’s statutory purpose, address performance measurement, and continue funding for TANF-related research...|$|R

5|$|HB 3466 {{would have}} {{increased}} penalties {{for possession of}} under an ounce of marijuana from an infraction (traffic ticket-like offense) to a Class A misdemeanor, the worst non-felony offense, with a fine of $100 to $1,000 per gram, up {{to a maximum of}} $5,000. The bill also would have created a new crime—being under the influence of marijuana—punishable by a fine of up to $5,000. The <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> have passed according to the positions of state senators, but was blocked on a technical basis which prevented it from coming to the floor the same day it was read—which allows public input—unless overridden by a vote.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{brought in}} two {{experienced}} Harvard Law School-educated War Department lawyers, Brigadier General Kenneth Royall and William L. Marbury {{to take up}} the job of drafting the legislation. The legislation was based on Bush and Conant's proposal, and the organization that it proposed was based on the existing structure of the Manhattan Project. Their draft <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> have created a nine-man commission consisting of five civilian and four military members. It granted the commission broad powers to acquire property, operate facilities, conduct research, regulate all forms of nuclear energy and administer its own security, administrative and audit regimes.|$|E
5|$|House Democrats had {{expected}} {{to be able to}} negotiate changes in a House-Senate conference before passing a final bill. Since any bill that emerged from conference that differed from the Senate <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> have to pass the Senate over another Republican filibuster, most House Democrats agreed to pass the Senate bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill. They drafted the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which could be passed by the reconciliation process.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the last}} time the Bengals {{defeated}} the Bills until Week 4 of the 2011 season. The <b>Bills</b> <b>would</b> go on to win 10 straight against them.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Bills</b> <b>would</b> trail 24-10 in {{the fourth}} quarter, but they {{would come back to}} tie the game after Marquise Goodwin caught a 40-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Thad Lewis and force overtime. In the extra period, the <b>Bills</b> <b>would</b> get the ball first, but would be forced to punt after they went 3 and out. The Bengals would return the punt 39 yards to set them up in field goal range. A couple of plays later, Mike Nugent would kick the game winning 43-yard field goal to end the game.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bills</b> <b>would</b> require {{implementation}} of this joint resolution so that only the most limited funding action be taken {{in order to provide}} for continuation of projects and activities.|$|R
5|$|Main {{supporters}} of the bill were the LDP and the Komeito (CGP), while the opposition included the Social Democratic Party (SDPJ) and Communist Party (CPJ), who cited the connotations both symbols had with the war era. The CPJ was further opposed for not allowing the issue {{to be decided by}} the public. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) could not develop party consensus on it. President of the DPJ, Naoto Kan stated that the DPJ must support the bill because the party already recognized both symbols as the symbols of Japan. Deputy Secretary General and future prime minister Yukio Hatoyama thought that this <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> cause further divisions among society and the public schools.|$|E
5|$|Millen {{introduced}} the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill, which provided for a paid repatriation commission and higher pensions for servicemen, into the Senate in March 1920. In {{response to the}} bill, and vigorous lobbying of Hughes by the veterans' movement, the bill faced difficulty in its passage and Senator Josiah Thomas successfully moved a resolution that a minister in one house might appear {{on the floor of}} the other. This <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> have allowed Millen to address the House of Representatives, where he was facing fierce criticism from the Country Party, although ultimately neither house acted on the resolution.|$|E
5|$|According to a MinnPost poll, Minnesotans {{blamed the}} Republican {{legislature}} {{more for the}} shutdown. Overall, 42% said Republicans in the legislature were more responsible, 21% said the DFL governor was more responsible, and 22% volunteered an answer that they were equally to blame. As expected, partisans blamed the other party more; only 10% of Republicans blamed the legislature more, and only 2% of DFLers blamed Dayton more. Following the shutdown, DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing appropriations bill that would prevent government shutdowns {{in the event of}} disagreements between the governor and legislature, as she had done in several past sessions. The House commissioned a policy brief from its research department, published in December 2011, that looked into what such a <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> require. The brief noted that such ideas had been considered before, including after the 2005 shutdown, and had been abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{compromise}} passed the Senate in March 1970, it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who {{was determined to}} end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a rider to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a conference committee and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as Congress had adjourned, not signing the <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> pocket veto it, Nixon hastily signed it just before midnight on December 31, 1970, only minutes before the deadline.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{balked at}} the plan, seeing in it {{an end to the}} United States policy of {{isolationism}} and the beginning of imperialism. Even some supporters of naval expansion were wary; Senator Eugene Hale feared that because the proposal was so large, the entire <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> be shot down and no money appropriated for any ships. However, in April 1890, the United States House of Representatives approved funding for three 8,000-long ton battleships. Tracy, trying to soothe tensions within Congress, remarked that these ships were so powerful that only twelve would be necessary instead of the 35 called for in the original plan. He also slashed the operating costs of the Navy by giving the remaining Civil War-era monitors—which were utterly obsolete by this time—to navy militias operated by the states. The appropriation was also approved by the Senate, and in total three coast-defense battleships (the Indiana class), a cruiser, and a torpedo boat were given official approval and funding on 30 June 1890.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of the {{succeeding}} Hanoverian dynasty, power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government. The first Hanoverian monarch, George I, relied on his ministers {{to a greater extent than}} had previous monarchs. Later Hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation: George III and George IV both openly opposed Catholic Emancipation and asserted that to grant assent to a Catholic emancipation <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> violate the Coronation Oath, which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established Church of England from Papal domination, and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy. However, George IV reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers. Thus, as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved, the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse, both in the United Kingdom and in the other Commonwealth realms.|$|E
5000|$|Money: A USD bill of any {{denomination}} weighs 1 g. There are 454 grams in a pound. One million $1 <b>bills</b> <b>would</b> weigh 2204.62 lb, or {{just over}} 1 ton.|$|R
