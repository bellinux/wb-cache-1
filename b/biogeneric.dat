5000|$|... rFVIIa is a {{glycoprotein}} {{which is}} produced by recombinant DNA technology. AryoSeven is formulated totally similar to the original drug {{with the name of}} NovoSeven. The product is the first biosimilar or <b>biogeneric</b> of the above-mentioned drug. This biomedicine is produced in baby hamster kidney cells (BHK) and has similar characteristics and functions with the native blood factor VII.|$|E
50|$|CinnoVex is {{the trade}} name of {{recombinant}} Interferon beta-1a, which is manufactured as biosimilar/biogeneric in Iran. It {{is produced in}} a lyophilized form and sold with distilled water for injection. Cinnovex was developed at the Fraunhofer Institute in collaboration with CinnaGen, and is the first therapeutic protein from a Fraunhofer laboratory to be approved as <b>biogeneric</b> / biosimilar medicine. There are several clinical studies to prove the similarity of CinnoVex and Avonex. A more water-soluble variant is currently being investigated by the Vakzine Projekt Management (VPM) GmbH in Braunschweig, Germany.|$|E
50|$|The CEREC {{method was}} {{developed}} by Prof. Werner H. Mörmann and Dr. Marco Brandestini at the University of Zurich in 1980. The first patient was treated with CEREC using VITABLOCS Mark I ceramic blocks in 1985. Siemens obtained the license to market and further develop the CEREC method in 1986 and launched the world’s 2nd CAD/CAM system in dentistry {{in the form of}} CEREC 1 in 1987. The areas of indication of the CEREC 2 system introduced in 1994 comprised inlays, onlays, crowns, and veneers. In 1997, the sale of Siemens AG’s dental division resulted in the company Sirona. The Windows-based CEREC 3 system was introduced in 2000. While these first three models were based on 2D technology, 3D software introduced in 2003 allowed dentists to construct restorations based on virtual three-dimensional models using the computer. While for some time it was only possible to attach all-ceramic crowns adhesively, the increased precision of the new generation of milling machine, MC XL, which was launched in 2007, made it possible to attach crowns using dental cement. In 2009, Sirona switched to a new imaging technology, the CEREC Bluecam, which is based on short-wave blue light, thus significantly increasing the level of precision in comparison to the previous 3D camera. Since 2010, the use of <b>Biogeneric</b> has made it possible to individually reconstruct the occlusal surfaces of damaged or missing teeth, while achieving a natural look. An interdisciplinary research group headed by Prof. Dr. Albert Mehl of the University of Zurich and Prof. Dr. Volker Blanz of the University of Siegen discovered that all of a patient’s teeth have individual characteristics that can be applied from one tooth to another. Launched in 2011, the 4.0 version of the software simplified the user interface with intuitive menu navigation. Since then, it has also been possible to work on several restorations within a single process (multiple restorations). The latest development is the CEREC Omnicam intraoral camera, which was launched on the market in 2012 and facilitates powder-free digital impressions in natural colors.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the occlusal {{morphology}} of partial crown reconstructions made by dental technicians with reconstructions made by a fully automatic software process (<b>biogeneric</b> tooth model) in relation to the original natural tooth shape. Material and methods: Stone replicas of natural teeth were measured three-dimensionally before preparing inlay and onlay cavities for ceramic restorations (n[*]=[*] 5). For each preparation, five reconstructions (in total n[*]=[*] 25) were made by five dental technicians. Additionally, reconstructions were calculated automatically by a software based on the <b>biogeneric</b> tooth model (Cerec 3 D). In order to compare the two different kinds of reconstruction, an objective metrical similarity measure (shape similarity value, SSV) based on calculated volumes between compared datasets was used. Results: In 22 of 25 cases, the reconstructions made by the CAD software were closer to the original situation than the reconstructions made by the technicians. Mean average SSV of reconstructions made by the technicians (310. 2 [*]±[*] 78. 8 μm) was significantly higher (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) than mean SSV of CAD reconstructions (<b>biogeneric</b> model) (222. 0 [*]±[*] 47. 7 μm). Conclusions: In the design of naturally shaped occlusal inlay/onlay surfaces, a fully automatic CAD system can be at least as good as conventional wax-ups by dental technicians. Clinical relevance: The adjustment of a dental restoration to fit the morphology of surrounding tooth structures, still presents challenges for the dentist...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Treatment of renal anaemia with epoetin is well established. However, epoetin is expensive. <b>Biogeneric</b> epoetin with proven {{efficacy}} {{would reduce}} cost and improve access to therapy. We conducted this first ever {{comparative study of}} a <b>biogeneric</b> and the original product. Methods: Stable haemodialysis patients with haemoglobin (Hb) of at least 9 g/dL and receiving the human recombinant erythropoietin Eprex were randomized to continue Eprex or convert to GerEPO, a <b>biogeneric</b> epoetin, for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was a change in Hb from baseline. Results: Ninety-three subjects were randomized to each arm. Ninety-two and 87 subjects on the Eprex and GerEPO arms, respectively, completed the trial. Mean Hb in both groups declined over time. The mean decline in Hb was- 0. 47 g/dL in the Eprex group and- 0. 45 g/dL in the GerEPO group. The mean difference in the change in Hb from baseline to week 12 {{between the two groups}} was 0. 02. The 95 % confidence interval was- 0. 42 to 0. 46, which lies within the margin of equivalence (10. 5 g/dL). The results of intention-to-treat analysis were similar. There {{were no significant differences in}} the epoetin dose, iron therapy or iron stores between the groups. Patients receiving GerEPO reported more adverse events. Conclusion: GerEPO was therapeutically equivalent to Eprex with respect to Hb response for patients with Hb in the subtherapeutic target range as is common in this study population. The trial duration was insufficient fo...|$|E
40|$|Once drug patents expire, {{the health}} {{authorities}} can approve the registry of similar products. They must {{request to the}} manufacturer the bibliographic background of the original product and the analytical results that certify drug quality. An inspection of the premises of the manufacturer is also required. The main goal of Ibis approval is to decrease cost, considering that the original product is usually more expensive. This is a current situation due to the imminent expiration of the patents of many biopharmaceutical products. Therefore, in Chile, the Public Health (ISP) and the Ministry of Health should consider that {{for this kind of}} products, until now, there are no interchangeable generic drugs, and that the similar drugs that are offered have a different chemical composition, since they have been manufactured through different processes, In the case of biological drugs (e. g. erythropoietir, somatotropin, heparin) the quality and homogeneity depend from the manufacture process. Its complete composition can not be absolutely elucidated; therefore small impurities or conformational variants can elicit an altered immune response or unexpected adverse reactions. This indicates that the approval of a <b>biogeneric</b> drug requires in addition to pharmacokinetic studies, preclinical and clinical analytical studies such as physicochemical assays, biological and immunological test. This issues have been established by WHO and have been incorporated for the main drug registry entities all over the world (FDA, EME 4, ANVISA) to approve <b>biogeneric</b> products...|$|E
40|$|The "biogeneric tooth model" can be {{used for}} {{computer-aided}} design (CAD) of the occlusal surface of dental restorations. From digital 3 D-data, it automatically retrieves a morphology matching the natural surface left after preparation. This study evaluates the potential of this method for generating well-matched and well-adjusted CAD/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) fabricated partial crowns. Twelve models with partial crown preparations were mounted into an articulator. Partial crowns were designed with the Cerec 3 D CAD software based on the <b>biogeneric</b> tooth model (Biog. CAD) and, for control, with a conventional data-based Cerec 3 D CAD software (Conv. CAD). The design time was measured, and the naturalness of the morphology was visually assessed. The restorations were milled, cemented on the models, and the vertical discrepancy and the time for final occlusal adjustment were measured. The Biog. CAD software offered a significantly higher naturalness (up to 225 to 11 scores) and was significantly faster by 251 (+/- 78) s in designing partial crowns (p < 0. 01) compared to Conv. CAD software. Vertical discrepancy, 0. 52 (+/- 0. 28) mm for Conv. CAD and 0. 46 (+/- 0. 19) mm for Biog. CAD, and occlusal adjustment time, 118 (+/- 132) s for Conv. CAD and 102 (+/- 77) s for Biog. CAD, did not differ significantly. In conclusion, the <b>biogeneric</b> tooth model is able to generate occlusal morphology of partial crowns in a fully automated process with higher naturalness compared to conventional interactive CAD software...|$|E
40|$|Biologics are {{becoming}} increasingly important for the potential treatment of widespread diseases such as cancer, anemia, and diabetes. As hundreds of biologics are going off-patent, the market has become ripe for the introduction of generic biologics. A regulatory pathway for biogenerics, however, is virtually nonexistent. The {{purpose of this paper}} is thus to analyze how a successful legislative pathway for generic biologics might be designed. The current regulatory scheme, economic concerns, health and safety concerns, and the need to provide proper incentives for innovation are analyzed. Finally, recent Congressional bills are outlined and critiqued, through which the structure of a successful pathway for <b>biogeneric</b> approval can be understood...|$|E
40|$|<b>Biogeneric</b> Reference Technique (BRT) of the CEREC 3 D v. 3. 8 {{software}} {{is an effective}} technique for single anterior ceramic crowns because it provides computer-controlled match of the tooth form to the contralateral tooth. BRT also enables the fabrication {{of two or more}} anterior all-ceramic crowns simultaneously. This clinical report demonstrates the clinical application of BRT for designing and milling two central incisors in one appointment using a single optical impression. After completing the virtual design of the first central incisor, it was copied and a mirror image was created. The second central incisor was designed using this replicated image and therefore a computer-controlled symmetry was obtained. The crowns were milled from monolithic feldspathic ceramic blocks and adhesively luted with dual-cured resin cement following dentin conditioning. At the two-year follow-up appointment, the restorations were intact, no adverse effects were noted, and the resultant appearance was highly satisfactory for the patient. A step-by-step protocol is described from design to cementation of these restorations...|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{philosophical}} attention directed to Kant’s intervention into biology has been directed toward Kant’s idea of a transcendental limit upon what can be understood constitutively.   Kant’s own wider philosophical practice, however, was principally oriented toward solving problems and the scientific benefits of his methodology of teleology have been largely underappreciated, {{at least in the}} English language literature.   This paper suggests that all basic biology has had, and continues to have, a need for some form of heuristic “bracketing” and that a renewal of some form of, albeit flexible, teleological methodological bracketing can better complement the productive assimilation into developmental biology of continuing advances in our understanding of the mesoscale physics and chemistry of soft, excitable condensed matter, than what has been the prevailing and  de facto  use of a form of bracketing shaped by the neoDarwinian Modern Synthesis.   Further we offer a concept of <b>biogeneric</b> processes and a framework of physico-genetic “dynamical patterning modules”, that can begin to account for the appearance of new Kantian “stocks of Keime und Anlagen”, capable of potentiating some range of possible organismal forms, and provide grounds for moving up the teleological “goalposts”, i. e., expanding the range of what can be accounted for on a constitutive basis.  </span...|$|E
