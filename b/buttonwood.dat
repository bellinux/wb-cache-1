5|$|PA284 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with PA287 {{just north of}} the village of English Center. The road winds northeast through rural Lycoming County alongside nearby Little Pine Creek. PA284 runs through Pine Township, soon reaching the newly named Blackstone Creek (from Little Pine). The two-lane continues through the dense woods in the area, paralleling Blackstone Creek into the village of <b>Buttonwood.</b> In <b>Buttonwood,</b> PA284 enters an interchange with US15, first intersecting with the ramp to US15 south. After crossing the freeway, PA284 curves north and ends at the junction with an on-ramp to US15 northbound.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{has been}} done in the Solomon Creek {{watershed}} in the past, causing considerable environmental damage. The mining began {{in the beginning of the}} 1800s and continued until the 1970s. However, there was one strip mining permit in the watershed in the late 1990s. Starting in 1967, the mine pools under the creek stopped having water pumped out of them. This led to them flooding and damaging buildings in the watershed in 1972 during Hurricane Agnes. To remedy the problem of the flooding, the <b>Buttonwood</b> Tunnel and three boreholes known as the South Wilkes-Barre Boreholes were created. The water quality of the creek was assessed in 1970 as part of Operation Scarlift. A 1977 study by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission observed brook trout inhabiting the watershed, although the stream was listed as impaired on account of the mining. A plan called the Solomon Creek Cold Water Conservation Plan was initiated in the summer of 2011 and continued into 2012.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{organization of}} securities trading in New York among brokers directly dealing {{with each other}} {{can be traced to}} the <b>Buttonwood</b> Agreement. Previously securities exchange had been intermediated by the auctioneers who also conducted more mundane auctions of commodities such as wheat and tobacco. On May 17, 1792 twenty four brokers signed the <b>Buttonwood</b> Agreement which set a floor commission rate charged to clients and bound the signers to give preference to the other signers in securities sales. The earliest securities traded were mostly governmental securities such as War Bonds from the Revolutionary War and First Bank of the United States stock, although Bank of New York stock was a non-governmental security traded in the early days. The Bank of North America along with the First Bank of the United States and the Bank of New York were the first shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange.|$|E
50|$|The main {{interest}} of these partners {{was to develop}} a rail link from Providence to the shore, with <b>Buttonwoods</b> as the terminus.

5000|$|<b>Buttonwoods</b> Beach Historic District is a {{historic}} district bounded by Brush Neck Cove, Greenwich Bay, Cooper and Promenade Avenues in Warwick, Rhode Island. [...] "Old Buttonwoods" [...] is a bucolic neighborhood on the eastern limb of the Nausauket neck, located in the West Bay area of Warwick, Rhode Island. <b>Buttonwoods</b> is delimited by Nausauket and Apponaug to the west, <b>Buttonwoods</b> Cove to the north, Greenwich (aka Cowesett) Bay {{to the south and}} Oakland Beach to the east. The Old <b>Buttonwoods</b> section of Warwick was founded as a summer colony in 1871 by the Rev. Moses Bixby of Providenceâ€™s Cranston Street Baptist Church, who was {{looking for a place to}} establish a summer colony by the shore for his congregation. He envisioned a community that would be similar to Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard, where the Methodists established a summer campground in 1835. Today, this coastal neighborhood on Greenwich Bay is home to people from many different religious backgrounds.|$|R

25|$|In 1817 the {{stockbrokers}} of New York {{operating under}} the <b>Buttonwood</b> Agreement instituted new reforms and reorganized. After sending a delegation to Philadelphia to observe the organization of their board of brokers, restrictions on manipulative trading were adopted as well as formal organs of governance. After re-forming as the New York Stock and Exchange Board the broker organization began renting out space exclusively for securities trading, which previously had been taking place at the Tontine Coffee House. Several locations were used between 1817 and 1865, when the present location was adopted.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 2007, the Department of Transportation {{announced}} {{the construction of the}} new interchange between Route15 and Route184, as part of the construction to upgrade Route15 into an interstate highway. The total cost for the portion from Trout Run to <b>Buttonwood</b> was to be $71 million (2007USD). Early plans were to build an interchange south of Route184, which would mean that southbound travelers would have to backtrack to access local businesses. Per a suggestion by the Fry family, owners of a local restaurant, the design was changed to realign Route184 to the north and build a full interchange. As a result, a few homes belonging to members of the Fry family would be {{in the way of the}} new roadways, and the buildings were moved to nearby family-owned land. The project was completed in the fall of 2009 with a ribbon cutting ceremony on the southbound lanes.|$|E

A cottage at 5 13th Avenue, across from the location of the original Moses Bixby house, built in 1872, was also leveled during the real estate boom of the 2000s upon the death of the former owner who had lived there for much of the 20th Century.|$|R
5000|$|Abutting Old <b>Buttonwoods</b> {{directly}} to the west is Budlong Farm, on which land is located the summer colony of the <b>Buttonwoods</b> Campers Association, established {{around the turn of}} the 20th century. The Budlong/Greene families were among the original colonists and founders of Warwick, Rhode Island, along with the Gorton, Lippitt and Potter families et al. The Greenes owned a huge portion of the Nausauket neck, which was divided up among the generations of Budlong/Greene heirs. The original Greene/Budlong farm homestead, built in 1776, still stands today and can be seen from <b>Buttonwoods</b> Avenue. Over time, tracts of land were sold off, among them, the tract sold to the <b>Buttonwoods</b> Beach Association (see above, purchase of land by Lodowick Brayton, The Rev. Jonathan Brayton, and Andrew Comstock). When Henry Warner Budlong inheirited what remained of the Greene family lands, he was approached to establish a summer colony similar to that of <b>Buttonwoods</b> Beach, but dedicated to middle-class families. At that time the <b>Buttonwoods</b> Campgrounds was established (circa 1899) allowing families to erect long tents (said to have been army surplus from the Civil War) and spend summers on the shore of Greenwich Bay. Henry Warner Budlong, whose memorial building sits next to Warwick City Hall in Apponaug, was a bachelor with no heirs. In his last will and testament, Budlong bequeathed the majority of his material assets to his housekeeper, Emily I. Hohler. The <b>Buttonwoods</b> Campers Association, currently consisting of 120 cottages, continued uninterrupted to lease the land. Budlong's will drawn up in 1928 (he died in 1929) specified that upon Mrs. Hohler's passing, the Budlong Farm land would not pass to her heirs, but would go to the Metropolitan Park Commission of the State of RI to be made into a memorial park named The Greene Park after his mother, Rhody Knight Greene. When Mrs. Hohler died Oct. 31, 1964, the Hohler daughters, Alice Hohler and Hope Maynard joined with the summer resident [...] "campers" [...] to contest the Budlong will. One camper, William McCaughey Jr., was key in obtaining a stay of the state's possession by then-governor John Chafee, who said the campers could remain on the contested land until a solution had been reached. The Hohler/Maynard families, with financial support from the summer residents, purchased an identical tract of waterfront land which was given to the state (and then the City of Warwick) to satisfy the Budlong will. That land was added to other land the City of Warwick owned, and became Warwick City Park.|$|R

In 1955 {{the name of the}} last stretch, between Piazza Albania and Via Marmorata, was changed into Viale Manlio Gelsomini. The <b>buttonwoods,</b> which in the 1990s were infected by ceratocystis fimbriata, have been replaced {{at the beginning of the}} 2000s with lime trees and oaks.|$|R
25|$|Birdwatching {{activity}} peaks {{each spring}} (usually April) when dozens of migratory bird species can {{pass through the}} park in a single day. Many birds land inside the parade grounds of Fort Jefferson where they are often observed at close range. Common migratory warblers include the northern parula, American redstart, prairie warbler, hooded warbler, palm warbler, black-and-white warbler, common yellowthroat, yellow-rumped warbler, ovenbird, northern waterthrush, black-throated blue warbler, blackpoll warbler, and Cape May warbler, with more than 20 additional warbler species having shown up at least once. Several raptor species as well as cattle egrets are often seen hunting songbirds. Until early 2013 a small freshwater fountain existed beneath several seaside mahoe and <b>buttonwood</b> trees, and was the only freshwater source for many miles. Maintenance issues necessitated its removal, but a replacement water barrel is scheduled for installation {{in the fall of}} 2013. Each year several bird guides offer tours of Dry Tortugas National Park during April and early May when daily bird lists can often reach 100 or more species.|$|E

50|$|<b>Buttonwoods</b> grow 39 to 46 {{feet tall}} {{but do not}} produce a true {{propagule}} in Florida. Tiny brownish flowers are located at the terminal ends of the branches forming a seed cluster known as the button. These trees are able to grow in areas seldom inundated by tidal water. Two glands are located {{at the apex of}} the petiole (leaf stalk) and excrete excess salts and extrafloral nectar.|$|R
500|$|Severe weather, in {{the form}} of {{tropical}} storms and hurricanes, also affects the structure of the Everglades. Between 1871 and 2003, 40tropical cyclones struck the Everglades, usually every one to three years. These storms alter the coastline, flush decaying vegetation from estuaries, strip weakened branches from trees, and disperse seeds, pollen, and plant material. Hurricane Donna in 1960 affected [...] of mangrove forests by depositing marl over the roots and depriving the trees of oxygen. It also eradicated orchids, bromeliads, and other epiphytes that once flourished in the mangroves; their reappearance may take a century or more. Donna also significantly spread <b>buttonwood,</b> saltwort, and glasswort, and epiphytes began to grow in new areas. Although the lasting effects remain to be seen, Hurricane Andrew in 1992 also destroyed mangrove forests and snapped slash pines in half. However, regrowth occurred quickly, and sand deposited by the storm surge improved nesting conditions for crocodiles and sea turtles.|$|E

50|$|This {{residential}} neighborhood is small, about 170 houses, {{and most of}} the houses are historic, with many Victorian cottages and larger shingled bungalows in the Arts and Crafts style. The waterfront along Promenade Avenue has many mature trees in their streets. Many of the original cottages have disappeared over the years, including the cottage at <b>Buttonwoods</b> Point, torn down in the 1980s, and the Moses Bixby cottage, which, except for the roof peak on the West side, was torn down during the real estate boom of the 2000s.

50|$|The colonial {{history of}} the {{property}} begins in the 1660s, when it was the home of Elizabeth Ward and Nathaniel Saltonstall, grandson of early Massachusetts settler Richard Saltonstall, {{and one of the}} judges of the Salem witch trials. The Saltonstall family held the property in the late 18th century, when a 30 acre parcel with the house on it was taken by mortgage foreclosure by George Watson, brother-in-law to Richard Saltonstall. The property was sold by Watson's heirs to James Duncan, Sr., and it either he or his son Samuel who built the brick Federal style house known as <b>Buttonwoods</b> that now stands on the property. The old Saltonstall house was demolished around this time.|$|R
50|$|It was {{originally}} {{a village in}} the Warwick Township of Kent County. It can be called an exclave, {{since there is no}} overland connection {{to the rest of the}} city of Warwick. Potowomut is often mistakenly thought to be part of the Town of East Greenwich because it shares the same ZIP code as all of East Greenwich and because East Greenwich is the preferred place name for postal purposes. Nathanael Greene, a general in the American Revolutionary War was born here on Forge Farm in 1742. When Warwick was settled, in the seventeenth century, travel by sea was often more convenient than travel over land. Thus, Potowomut's location would have allowed relatively easy travel across Greenwich Bay to Warwick Neck or <b>Buttonwoods.</b>|$|R
