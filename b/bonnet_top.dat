5000|$|The new car was {{introduced}} in 1966 and called the Triumph GT6. The new body was a sleek fastback design with an opening rear hatch (This gave the GT6 the nickname [...] "Poor man's E-Type".) It was really a 2-seater, but a small extra rear seat could be ordered if required and was large enough for small children. The family resemblance to the Spitfire Mk II was strong, the longer 6-cylinder engine necessitated a new <b>bonnet</b> <b>top</b> with a power bulge and the doors were provided with opening quarter light windows and squared-off glass in the top rear corner. The 6-cylinder engine was tuned to develop [...] at 5000 rpm, and produced 117 lbft Nm of torque at 3000 rpm. The increased power necessitated certain changes to the Spitfire mechanics; the radiator was new and mounted further forward {{in the car and}} the gearbox was the stronger unit from the Vitesse, with optional overdrive. Front springs were uprated to cope with the extra weight of the new engine. The overall vehicle weight unladed was 1904 lb. The interior of the GT6 was well equipped; a wooden dashboard housed a full complement of instruments, with carpets and heater included as standard.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the injury mechanism of pedestrian chests in collisions with passenger vehicles of various frontal shapes and examining {{the influence of the}} local structural stiffness on the chest injury risk by using the headform impact test at the chest contact area of the vehicle. Three simulations of vehicle to pedestrian collisions were conducted using three validated pedestrian finite element (FE) models of three pedestrian heights of 177 (AM 50 th), 165 and 150 cm and three FE vehicles,models representing a one-box vehicle, a minicar and a medium car. The validity of the vehicle models was evaluated by comparing the headform acceleration against the measured responses from headform impact tests. The chest impact kinematics and the injury mechanisms were analyzed in terms of the distribution of the von Mises stress of the ribcage {{and in terms of the}} chest deflections. The chest contact locations on the front panel and the <b>bonnet</b> <b>top</b> were identified in connection to the causation of rib fractures. The risk of rib fractures was predicted by using the von Mises stress distribution. The headform impact tests were carried out at the chest contact area on the front panel and bonnet to examine the safety performance with respect to pedestrian chest protection. In simulations of the one-box vehicle to pedestrian collisions, the chest was struck directly by the frontal structure at a high velocity and deformed substantially, since a shear force was generated by the stiff windshield frame. The acceleration of the headform was related to the rib deflections. The injury threshold of the ribcage deflection (42 mm) corresponded to the headform average acceleration of 68 G. In the minicar collision, the chest was struck with the <b>bonnet</b> <b>top</b> and cowl area at a low velocity, and the deformation was small due to the distributed contact force between the chest and the <b>bonnet</b> <b>top.</b> Besides, the ribcage deformation was too small for bridging a relation between the headform accelerations and rib deflections. In the medium car collision, the deformation mode of the chest was similar to that in the minicar collision. The chest collided with the <b>bonnet</b> <b>top</b> at a low velocity and deformed uniformly. The deflection of the ribs had an observable correlation with the headform accelerations measured in the headform impact tests. The frontal shape of a vehicle has a large influence on a pedestrian's chest loadings, and the chest deformation depends on the size of the pedestrian and the stiffness of the vehicle. The one-box passenger vehicle causes a high chest injury risk. The headform impactor test can be utilized for the evaluation of the local stiffness of a vehicle's frontal structure. The reduction of the headform acceleration is an effective measure for pedestrian chest protection for specific shapes of vehicles by efficacy in modifying the local structural stiffness...|$|E
40|$|Committee (EEVC) {{published}} {{a set of}} test requirements to address pedestrian impacts against car fronts. These consisted of component tests simulating impact by the lower leg and knee joint against the bumper, the upper leg and hip against the bonnet leading edge, and child and adult heads against the <b>bonnet</b> <b>top.</b> Since then, these requirements have been set out in a draft EC Directive, which may {{become part of the}} type-approval requirements for passenger cars sold in the European Union. The same test specification already forms part of the safety assessment of selected vehicles under the Euro-NCAP initiative. For both these reasons, manufacturers are paying close attention to the performance of their vehicles in these tests. MIRA has carried out many tests to the EEVC WGlO specification, and experience to date shows that existing models fall well short of meeting these requirements. It appears that cars will need to undergo profound changes in design to meet the required standard. This paper details the engineering problems associated with achieving standards set out in the Directive in a variety of car types, and the other aspects of vehicle design which will be affected. Some possible design strategies are also outlined...|$|E
50|$|The Morgan F-4 was {{introduced}} in 1933 at the Olympia Motor Cycle Show. The F-4 had a new pressed-steel chassis the four-cylinder Ford Sidevalve engine used in the Model Y, and a four-seat body. The F-4 was supplemented by the two-seat F-2 in 1935 and the more sporting F Super, with cycle-type wings and louvred <b>bonnet</b> <b>tops,</b> in 1937. Production of the Ford-engined three-wheelers continued until 1952.|$|R

40|$|In 1987 the European Experimental Vehicles Committee (EEVC) {{has set up}} a Working Group 10 {{with the}} task to improve an {{existing}} proposal for an EC Directive with respect to pedestrian protection and to coordinate the necessary research. This Working Group finalized its activities in 1994. This paper gives a general description and background information of the test methods developed by EEVC WG 10 for assessing the protection afforded to pedestrians by the fronts of cars in an accident. The test methods are based on three sub-system tests, essentially to the bumper, bonnet leading edge and <b>bonnet</b> <b>top</b> surface. Each of the test conditions are generally based on a car to pedestrian impact velocity of 40 km/h but for the assessment of {{the leading edge of the}} bonnet, the test conditions are adjusted to compensate for the influence of vehicle shape. The acceptance levels for the tests are based on the characteristics of the weaker sections of the adult population including the aged, who have been shown to be the most susceptible to injury. The test methods are considered to be appropriate of children, but a separate child head impact test has been included to assess their particular requirements...|$|E
40|$|Statistic studies {{carried out}} during last decades have {{underlined}} as pedestrians - with a prevalence {{of children and}} elderly - are a category with great risk in car accidents, particularly in the urban areas: according to recent investigations of a research committee of the European Community (CEC 2001), {{the risk of death}} in case of accident is, for pedestrians and cyclists, equal respectively to 9 and 8 times vehicle occupants' one. Particularly, in the European Union every year about 7000 pedestrians die (EEVC, European Enhanced Vehicle-safety Committee, "Improved test methods to evaluate pedestrian protection afforded by passenger cars," 1998; ETSC, European Transport Safety Council, "Safety of Pedestrian and Cyclists in Urban Areas,"[1, 5] 1999); that value represents around the 20 % of the total of death caused from road accidents. In the world, this percentage varies from 14 % in the United States (NTSHA, "Traffic safety facts 1994," 1995) at 47 % in Thailandia (D. Mohan, J. Kajzer, K. Bawa Blialla, S. Chawla, S. Sarabjit, Conference on the Biomechanics of Impacts, 1995). Sensitization of the public bodies and of the private companies towards the problem of pedestrian passive safety allowed the start of systematic study in subject, so that the European Committee, in 1988, appointed a working group (WG 10) which, in the 1994, {{at the end of its}} task, has defined a test protocol for the evaluation of the "aggressiveness" of the front part of the vehicle towards pedestrians. This protocol, partially revised in the 1998 [2] by a followed working group (WG 17), establish the use of impactors for simulating, singularly, the body parts that, according to thorough statistic studies, have resulted as the mostly exposed to serious damages: knees, pelvis and the head. For each of these impacts it has been found the area statistically interested from greatest number of serious impacts in order to reach the definition of three types of test: legform to bumper test, upper legform (femur-pelvis) to bonnet leading edge test, head to <b>bonnet</b> <b>top</b> test, using, in that case, impactors of two different measures, adult and child...|$|E

60|$|Thus {{things went}} on, till a certain market-morning {{brought a new}} sensation. Elizabeth and Lucetta were sitting at breakfast when a parcel {{containing}} two dresses arrived for the latter from London. She called Elizabeth from her breakfast, and entering her friend's bedroom Elizabeth saw the gowns {{spread out on the}} bed, one of a deep cherry colour, the other lighter--a glove lying {{at the end of each}} sleeve, a <b>bonnet</b> at the <b>top</b> of each neck, and parasols across the gloves, Lucetta standing beside the suggested human figure in an attitude of contemplation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{gentoo penguin}} is easily {{recognized}} by the wide white stripe extending like a <b>bonnet</b> across the <b>top</b> of its head and its bright orange-red bill. It has pale whitish-pink webbed feet and a fairly long tail - the most prominent tail of all penguins. Chicks have grey backs with white fronts. As the gentoo penguin waddles along on land, its tail sticks out behind, sweeping from side to side, hence the scientific name Pygoscelis, which means [...] "rump-tailed". The specific name papua is a misnomer; in the original description, Johann Reinhold Forster, a naturalist who had circumnavigated the world with Captain James Cook, falsely assumed that the species occurred in Papua New Guinea.|$|R
60|$|And tittering, {{they passed}} by the brother and sister, who were still unseen, but Robert heaved a sigh and murmured, 'Miserable work!' {{somewhat}} to his sister's surprise, for to her the great ill-regulated household was an unquestioned institution, {{and she did not}} expect him to bestow so much compassion on Augusta's discarded <b>bonnet.</b> At the <b>top</b> of the steps they opened a door, and entered a great wide hall. All was exceedingly still. A gas-light was burning over the fire-place, but the corners were in gloom, and the coats and cloaks looked like human figures in the distance. Phoebe waited while Robert lighted her candle for her. Albeit she was not nervous, she started when a door was sharply pushed open, and another figure appeared; but it was nothing worse than her brother Mervyn, in easy costume, and redolent of tobacco.|$|R
6000|$|Her {{first thought}} was to put the {{disguise}} back in her trunk. But after what had happened, there was danger in trusting it so near to herself while she and Mrs. Wragge were together under the same roof. She resolved {{to be rid of}} it that evening, and boldly determined on sending it back to Birmingham. Her bonnet-box fitted into her trunk. She took the box out, thrust in the wig and cloak, and remorselessly flattened down the <b>bonnet</b> at the <b>top.</b> The gown (which she had not yet taken off) was her own; Mrs. Wragge had been accustomed to see her in it--there was no need to send the gown back. Before closing the box, she hastily traced these lines on a sheet of paper: [...] "I took the inclosed things away by mistake. Please keep them for me, with the rest of my luggage in your possession, until you hear from me again." [...] Putting the paper on the <b>top</b> of the <b>bonnet,</b> she directed the box to Captain Wragge at Birmingham, took it downstairs immediately, and sent the landlady's daughter away with it to the nearest Receiving-house. [...] "That difficulty is disposed of," [...] she thought, as she went back to her own room again.|$|R

weeks I {{ought to go to}} the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about lo minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour l wait 2 oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs <b>bonnet</b> on the <b>top</b> of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming|$|R
