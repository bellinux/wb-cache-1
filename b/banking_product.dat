40|$|Purpose – The {{rapid growth}} of Islamic banking in Malaysia {{warrants}} banking institutions being more proactive and innovative in marketing their products. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to re‐evaluate the progress and achievements of Islamic banking in Malaysia, particularly in the area of sales and marketing of Islamic banking services. Design/methodology/approach – This paper adopts a comprehensive literature review from various published sources. All related references were discovered through electronic databases, journals and books in the area of the relevant literature in Islamic finance, banking and services marketing. Findings – The driving force for the growth of Islamic <b>banking</b> and financing <b>products</b> is the corporate clients, and not the Muslim individuals. In fact, the non‐Muslim individuals also use Islamic banking if they find that the service is good and meets their expectations. This paper shows evidence that the marketing activities of Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>products</b> is relatively ineffective compared to the conventional <b>banking</b> <b>products</b> in Malaysia. This paper also discusses the reasons for the ineffectiveness of marketing Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>products</b> at the micro and macro‐level. Depending on religion alone is not the best strategy to attract customers. Practical implications – The products offered by the Islamic banking system have to compete with those of the conventional banking system. Hence, a continuous review of marketing strategies for Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>products</b> is crucial in every Islamic financial institution. Originality/value – This paper fulfils a need to study whether the common methods in marketing conventional <b>banking</b> <b>products</b> would be effective in the context of marketing Islamic <b>banking</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R
