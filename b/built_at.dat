5|$|A {{small wooden}} {{platform}} was <b>built</b> <b>at</b> Hellingly railway station, opposite {{the main line}} platform. This had no connection to the station buildings and was used only for the transfer of passengers between main-line and hospital trains, and kept chained off when not in use. Coal yards and sidings were also <b>built</b> <b>at</b> Hellingly station. The hospital opened to patients, and the railway to passengers, on 20 July 1903.|$|E

5|$|In 1843, {{another group}} of planned Greek Revival townhouses was <b>built</b> <b>at</b> 160-168 Second Street. Unusual for urban houses, they {{featured}} one-and-a-half-story porticos on their front facades, with Ionic columns, and (originally) side yards. Another house was <b>built</b> <b>at</b> 170, several years later, in a similar style. They were widely imitated elsewhere in the city.|$|E
5|$|Official figures state 2,139 Do 17s {{were built}} on German {{assembly}} lines. At the Dornier factory at Oberpfaffenhofen, 328 Do 17Es were built {{along with a}} further 77 Do 17Fs and 200 Do 17M variants. Do 17Z production figures for Oberpfaffenhofen stand at 420. At Friedrichshafen, 84 Do 17Ks were built, {{some of which were}} sold to the Yugoslav Royal Air Force. Do 17P production was spread out over different factory lines. At Siebel/Halle, eight were <b>built.</b> <b>At</b> the Henschel factory at Berlin-Schönefeld 73 were constructed. At the HFB plant in Hamburg 149 were built. Henschel also produced some 320 Do 17Zs, HFB contributed to construction of 74 at its Hamburg plant, and another 73 were <b>built</b> <b>at</b> Siebel. Some 105 examples of the Dornier Do 215B was later <b>built</b> <b>at</b> Oberpfaffenhofen.|$|E

5|$|The area {{attracted}} more social housing when the Westwoods and Manor Farm estates {{were developed in}} the 1960s. A large private housing estate was <b>built</b> <b>at</b> Sharp Lane after 1972 and 1,300 houses were <b>built</b> <b>at</b> Leeds New Forest Village after 2005.|$|E

5|$|A second long-distance {{platform}} {{and a new}} hall were <b>built</b> <b>at</b> Zoo station from 1934 to 1940. The station hall was only glazed in the 1950s, however. The notable terraced vestibule dates from the same time.|$|E
5|$|Aberdour Castle {{is located}} in the village of Easter Aberdour, Fife, Scotland. Parts of the castle date from around 1200, making Aberdour one of the two oldest datable {{standing}} castles in Scotland, along with Castle Sween in Argyll, which was <b>built</b> <b>at</b> around the same time.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, {{the castle}} is unusual for this period. Its design appears {{somewhat}} backward, particularly {{in comparison to}} the nearby fortification of Harry's Walls, <b>built</b> <b>at</b> {{the same time as the}} castle, but which adopted a more contemporary design that employed bastions. Its closest equivalents are the blockhouses built by Henry VIII on the River Thames.|$|E

5|$|At Hell, there arose a {{disagreement}} {{about where the}} Hell–Sunnan Line should branch from the Meråker Line. Initial proposals were to place the branch from a location before Hell Station, thus forcing trains to back up from Hell Station before continuing northwards. The station building at Hell was also {{too small for the}} increased traffic, so it was moved to Sunnan Station and a new station building, with capacity for 25 employees, was <b>built</b> <b>at</b> Hell. In Skatval, there was a controversy as to whether the station should be <b>built</b> <b>at</b> Mæhre or Alstad. Mæhre (later Skatval) had support from the municipal council and was closer to the larger share of the area's population. However, the military wanted Alstad, as it was a rally point for the military in case of a Swedish invasion, and gave easy waterway access from Frosta. The station was placed at Mæhre, while a passing loop was <b>built</b> <b>at</b> Alstad.|$|E

5|$|August 27–28, 1878 – Streets are {{clogged with}} fallen trees as a {{hurricane}} passes to the north. At {{the height of}} a storm, a floating dry dock—the largest ever <b>built</b> <b>at</b> the time—is damaged after breaking from its moorings at HM Dockyard, crushing wharves and a mooring bridge. The dock came to rest on a breakwater.|$|E
5|$|Because Exmoor was a royal forest, i.e. {{a hunting}} reserve, it was {{unpopulated}} in Medieval times. The first {{house on the}} moor was only <b>built</b> <b>at</b> Simonsbath in 1654. It {{was not until the}} 19th century that farms were built around the moor.|$|E
5|$|Before {{construction}} could begin, the Navy {{found itself}} {{in the midst of}} political situation because the Hungarian government demanded that {{a substantial portion of the}} submarine contracts be allocated to Hungarian firms. After intricate negotiations, the order was split into two orders of two submarines each, with U-20 and U-21 <b>built</b> <b>at</b> the Pola Navy Yard, and U-22 and U-23 <b>built</b> <b>at</b> the Hungarian UBAG yard at Fiume. The subcontracts were also divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms, with about two-thirds going to Hungarian companies and one-third to Austrian companies. This allocation of contracts, while politically expedient, exacerbated technical problems that resulted in numerous modifications and delays.|$|E
