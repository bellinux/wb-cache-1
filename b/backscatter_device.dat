40|$|Ambient {{backscatter}} communication (AmBC) {{enables a}} passive <b>backscatter</b> <b>device</b> to transmit {{information to a}} reader using ambient RF signals, and {{has emerged as a}} promising solution to green Internet-of-Things (IoT). Conventional AmBC receivers are interested in recovering the information from the ambient <b>backscatter</b> <b>device</b> (A-BD) only. In this paper, we propose a cooperative AmBC (CABC) system in which the reader recovers information not only from the A-BD, but also from the RF source. We first establish the system model for the CABC system from spread spectrum and spectrum sharing perspectives. Then, for flat fading channels, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, suboptimal linear detectors as well as successive interference-cancellation (SIC) based detectors. For frequency-selective fading channels, the system model for the CABC system over ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) carriers is proposed, upon which a low-complexity optimal ML detector is derived. For both kinds of channels, the bit-error-rate (BER) expressions for the proposed detectors are derived in closed forms. Finally, extensive numerical results have shown that, when the A-BD signal and the RF-source signal have equal symbol period, the proposed SIC-based detectors can achieve near-ML detection performance for typical application scenarios, and when the A-BD symbol period is longer than the RF-source symbol period, the existence of backscattered signal in the CABC system can enhance the ML detection performance of the RF-source signal, thanks to the beneficial effect of the backscatter link when the A-BD transmits at a lower rate than the RF source.

This paper overturns this conventional wisdom about backscatter and presents the first wide-area backscatter system. Our design can successfully backscatter from any location between an RF source and receiver, separated by 475 m, while being compatible with commodity LoRa hardware.

40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen a {{dramatic}} growth in wireless sensing systems, with millions of wirelessly connected sensors becoming first-class citizens of the Internet. The number of wireless sensing devices is expected to surpass 6. 75 billion by 2017, more than the world 2 ̆ 7 s population {{as well as the}} combined market of smartphones, tablets, and PCs. However, its growth faces two pressing challenges: battery energy density and wireless radio power consumption. Battery energy density looms as a fundamental limiting factor due to slow improvements {{over the past several decades}} (3 x over 22 years). Wireless radio power consumption is another key challenge because high-speed wireless communication is often far more expensive energy-wise than computation, storage and sensing. To make matters worse, wireless sensing devices are generating an increasing amount of data. These challenges raise a fundamental question [...] - how should we power and communicate with wireless sensing devices. More specifically, instead of using batteries, can we leverage other energy sources to reduce, if not eliminate, the dependence on batteries? Similarly, instead of optimizing existing wireless radios, can we fundamentally change how radios transmit wireless signals to achieve lower power consumption? A promising technique to address these questions is backscatter [...] - a primitive that enables RF energy harvesting and ultra-low-power wireless communication. Backscatter has the potential to reduce dependence on batteries because it can obtain energy by rectifying the wireless signals transmitted by a backscatter reader. Backscatter can also work by reflecting existing wireless signals (WiFi, BLE) when these are available nearby. Because signal reflection only consumes uWs of power, backscatter can enable ultra-low-power wireless communication. However, the use of backscatter for communicating with wireless sensing devices presents several challenges. First, decreasing RF power across distance limits the operational range of micro-powered backscatter devices. This raises the question of how to maintain a communication link with a <b>backscatter</b> <b>device</b> despite tiny amount of harvested power. Second, even though the backscatter RF front-end is extremely power-efficient, the computational and sensing overhead on backscatter sensors limit its ability to operate with a few micro-Watts of power. Such overhead is a negligible factor of overall power consumption for platforms where radio power consumption is high (e. g. WiFi or Bluetooth based devices). However, it becomes the bottleneck for backscatter based platforms. Third, backscatter readers are not currently deployed in existing indoor environments to provide a continuous carrier for carrying backscattered information. As a result, backscatter deployment is not yet widespread. This thesis addresses these challenges by making the following contributions. First, we design a network stack that enables continuous operation despite decreasing harvested power across distance by employing an OS abstraction [...] - task fragmentation. We show that such a network stack enables packet transfer even when the whole system is powered by a 3 cmx 3 cm solar panel under natural indoor light condition. Second, we design a hardware architecture that minimizes the computational overhead of backscatter to enable over 1 Mbps backscatter transmission while consuming less than 100 uWs of power, a two order of magnitude improvement over the state-of-the-art. Finally, we design a system that can leverage both ambient WiFi and BLE signals for backscatter. Our empirical evaluation shows that we can backscatter 500 bps data on top of a WiFi stream and 50 kbps data on top of a Bluetooth stream when the <b>backscatter</b> <b>device</b> is 3 m away from the commercial WiFi and Bluetooth receivers...|$|E

Moreover, our analysis proves that a backscatter system—transmitting one symbol per OFDM symbol of the legacy system—can achieve satisfactory data rates over relatively short distances, especially when the intended recipient of the backscatter signal is co-located with the legacy transmitter, i. e., {{they are on the}} same device...|$|R

Increased particulate matter in the water column, possibly related to the seepage and/or higher rates of erosion near slump structures, is considered to be the cause of the increased light scattering, rather than bubbles in the water column. Methane concentrations calculated from the METS are in good agreement with concentrations measured by gas chromatography in water samples collected at the same time. However, there is a c. 20  min (c. 900  m) delay in the METS signal reaching maximum CH 4 concentrations. The maximum methane concentration occurs near the plateau of Eastern Rock Garden close to the edge of a slump, at 610  m below sea level (mbsl). This is close to the depth (c. 630  mbsl) where a bottom simulating reflector (BSR) pinches out at the seafloor. Fluctuating water temperatures observed in previous studies indicate that the stability zone for pure methane hydrate in the ocean varies between 630 and 710  mbsl. However, based on calculations of the geothermal gradients from BSRs, we suggest gas hydrate in the study area to be more stable than hydrate from pure methane in sea water, moving the phase boundary in the ocean upward. Small fractions of additional higher order hydrocarbon gases are the most likely cause for increased hydrate stability. Relatively high methane concentrations have been measured down to c. 1000  mbsl, most likely in response to sediment slumping caused by gas hydrate destabilisation of the sediments and/or marking seepage through the gas hydrate zone...|$|E
40|$|Omakere Ridge {{is one of}} {{a series}} of {{prominent}} northeast-southwest orientated anticlinal ridges associated with major thrust faults on New Zealand’s Hikurangi margin. The Hikurangi margin is an extensive gas hydrate province and recent marine surveys have confirmed that the mid-slope Omakere Ridge is a zone of methane-rich seabed seepage. Acoustic flares initially observed in the area by fishermen, were imaged in the water column at Omakere Ridge during a 2006 RV Tangaroa survey (TAN 06 - 07). Anomalous methane concentrations (up to 165 nM) were detected by a methane sensor (METS) attached to a conductivity-temperature-depth-optical <b>backscatter</b> <b>device</b> (CTD) on TAN 06 - 07 and a 2007 RV Sonne survey (SO- 191). Six seep sites have been identified at the southern end of Omakere Ridge, where it bifurcates into two parallel ridgelines. All sites are located towards the crests of the two ridgelines in approximately 1150 m water depth. The seabed seeps were identified acoustically with an EdgeTech Deep-Tow side-scan operating at 75 kHz, and are shown as high backscatter intensity areas on processed side-scan data, which are interpreted to be methane derived authigenic carbonate hardgrounds. Acoustic shadows behind hardgrounds in the side-scan far range suggest the seabed features have moderate relief. Sub-bottom profiles acquired with an EdgeTech Deep-Tow chirper system, operating at 2 - 10 kHz, identified numerous signatures of shallow gas in the near subsurface. These signatures include zones of acoustic turbidity and gas blanking, interpreted to mark shallow gas fronts. The evidence for shallow gas in the subsurface from the sub-bottom profiler displays a marked spatial correlation with seabed expressions of seepage. The seepage sites also correspond to potential gas indicators in multi-channel seismic data, such as interpreted amplitude anomalies. Enigmatic subsurface features in the subbottom profiler data, such as potential amplitude anomalies and gas blanking, which are below the depression that bifurcates the ridge and are not associated with surface expressions of seepage, may represent lithological and topographic features or may be a component of the gas migration pathway which feeds the seeps on the ridge crest. Underwater video and still camera images show seabed seepage sites of high backscatter intensity represent widespread authigenic carbonate concretions and chemoherms associated with biological assemblages including siboglinid tube worms, vesicomyid clams, bathymodiolin mussels, and bacterial mats. A high backscatter intensity site of similar acoustic character to, and directly adjacent to, seep sites on the southern part of the ridge does not contain seep fauna and is interpreted to be a cold-water reef. While this feature may represent a relict seep, this finding highlights the fact that present day seepage cannot be identified with acoustic techniques alone...|$|E
40|$|Backscatter {{communication}} is an emerging wireless technology that recently has gained {{an increase in}} attention from both academic and industry circles. The key innovation of the technology {{is the ability of}} ultra-low power devices to utilize nearby existing radio signals to communicate. As {{there is no need to}} generate their own energetic radio signal, the devices can benefit from a simple design, are very inexpensive and are extremely energy efficient compared with traditional wireless communication. These benefits have made backscatter communication a desirable candidate for distributed wireless sensor network applications with energy constraints. The backscatter channel presents a unique set of challenges. Unlike a conventional one-way communication (in which the information source is also the energy source), the backscatter channel experiences strong self-interference and spread Doppler clutter that mask the information-bearing (modulated) signal scattered from the device. Both of these sources of interference arise from the scattering of the transmitted signal off of objects, both stationary and moving, in the environment. Additionally, the measurement of the location of the <b>backscatter</b> <b>device</b> is negatively affected by both the clutter and the modulation of the signal return. This work proposes a channel coding framework for the backscatter channel consisting of a bi-static transmitter/receiver pair and a quasi-cooperative transponder. It proposes to use run-length limited coding to mitigate the background self-interference and spread-Doppler clutter with only a small decrease in communication rate. The proposed method applies to both binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) and quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) scheme and provides an increase in rate by up to a factor of two compared with previous methods. Additionally, this work analyzes the use of frequency modulation and bi-phase waveform coding for the transmitted (interrogating) waveform for high precision range estimation of the transponder location. Compared to previous methods, optimal lower range sidelobes are achieved. Moreover, since both the transmitted (interrogating) waveform coding and transponder communication coding result in instantaneous phase modulation of the signal, cross-interference between localization and communication tasks exists. Phase discriminating algorithm is proposed to make it possible to separate the waveform coding from the communication coding, upon reception, and achieve localization with increased signal energy by up to 3 dB compared with previous reported results. The joint communication-localization framework also enables a low-complexity receiver design because the same radio is used both for localization and communication. Simulations comparing the performance of different codes corroborate the theoretical results and offer possible trade-off between information rate and clutter mitigation as well as a trade-off between choice of waveform-channel coding pairs. Experimental results from a brass-board microwave system in an indoor environment are also presented and discussed. Dissertatio...|$|E

Further, variation in power availability for conventional RF harvesters, which target single fixed spectral bands, severely limits {{the area in which}} they can be applied. Ambient backscatter addresses communication energy requirements by employing ambient RF energy in another way: devices perform modulated scattering of ambient RF to transmit information. This allows RF harvesting ambient <b>backscatter</b> <b>devices</b> to communicate with far less power than those using conventional radio, partially closing the gap between the power requirements of a connected device and the power harvesting capabilities of an ambient harvester.

[...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 This thesis explores new {{wireless}} power and backscatter communication architectures for ultra-low-power wireless sensors {{and other devices}} such as wearables. We first present measurement, analysis and harvesting approaches for extracting energy from 2. 4 GHz wireless communication signals, including an approach for powering a relatively high power sensor in burst mode at an input power level of - 15 dBm. We present the first backscatter-based data uplink approach that achieves compatibility between <b>backscatter</b> <b>devices</b> and billions of completely unmodified standard wireless devices using the Bluetooth Low Energy standard. We show that this data uplink approach can communicate with BLE receivers with a radio communication efficiency of 28. 4 pJ/bit. This is over 100 x lower energy per bit than conventional BLE transmitters. One microcontroller based implementation consumes over 6 x less power than the best commercially-available Bluetooth transmitters, and can leverage both modulated and unmodulated carriers to provide the backscatter uplink. This al- lows us to transform one BLE signal as a carrier source for another BLE-Backscatter signal. We investigate {{the range of the}} BLE-Backscatter system in both bistatic and monostatic, full-duplex application scenarios. The range analysis considers the BLE receiver sensitivity and performance in the presence of self-jamming interference from the external carrier source in the bistatic case. We also present a carrier cancellation architecture that reduces self-jamming in the monostatic case. We characterize the packet error rate and received signal strength in both cabled and over-the-air scenarios. Finally we present an ultra-low power superheterodyne receiver architecture that leverages an external carrier as the local oscillator, removing the need for on board (or on chip) generation of the local oscillator signal.

Nevertheless, the high power costs of communication per distance unit lead to poor technical solutions, particularly in terms of flexibility and efficiency. A future of devices connected through an Internet of Things (IoT) network will require billions of sensors that will affect costs and increase the energy requirements. Backscattering communication through RFID nodes is a promising solution to solve the energy burden of the future, but this technology is still limited in rage and cannot compete yet with the wide coverage advantages of BLE, WiFi, cellular and LoRa networks. Although BLE provides a solid infrastructure for the IoT thanks to largely available BLE-capable devices installed in smart phones, tablets and PCs, the Radio Frequency (RF) front-end of a BLE node is complex and its high power consumption limits portability and require continuous maintenance. Sensor-based RFIDs, on the other hand, require lower orders of magnitude of energy-per-bit for the wireless transfer of information but, despite a simpler RF front-end, their power constraints limit the communications to short ranges. This research aimed to design a power-stingy <b>backscattering</b> <b>device</b> able to cover an area so wide to enable the use of RFID communications for new applications.

40|$|Advanced imaging {{technologies}} {{are a new}} class of peo-ple screening systems used at airports and other sensitive environments to detect metallic as well as nonmetallic contraband. We present the first independent security evaluation of such a system, the Rapiscan Secure 1000 full-body scanner, which was widely deployed at airport checkpoints in the U. S. from 2009 until 2013. We find that the system provides weak protection against adaptive adversaries: It is possible to conceal knives, guns, and explosives from detection by exploiting properties of the <b>device’s</b> <b>backscatter</b> X-ray technology. We also investi-gate cyberphysical threats and propose novel attacks that use malicious software and hardware to compromise the the effectiveness, safety, and privacy of the device. Over-all, our findings paint a mixed picture of the Secure 1000 that carries lessons for the design, evaluation, and opera-tion of advanced imaging technologies, for the ongoing public debate concerning their use, and for cyberphysical security more broadly...|$|R
40|$|State-of-the-art imaging {{technologies}} for monitoring {{the integrity of}} oil and gas well bores are typically limited to inspection of metal casings and cement bond interfaces close to the first casing region. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a novel well-integrity inspection system that is capable of providing enhanced information about the flaw structure and topology of hydrocarbon producing well bores. In order to achieve this, we propose the development of a multi-element electromagnetic (EM) inspection tool that can provide information about material loss in the first and second casing structure as well as information about eccentricity between multiple casing strings. Furthermore, the information gathered from the EM inspection tool will be combined with other imaging modalities (e. g. data from an x-ray <b>backscatter</b> imaging <b>device).</b> The independently acquired data are then fused to achieve enhanced accuracy compared to the sum of individual acquired data. A test rig composed of several concentric pipes was assembled and various defect structures in the metal casings were imaged. Initial test results were obtained with a scanning system that includes a transmitting coil and several receiving coils that are mounted on a single rod. A mechanical linear translation stage was used to move the EM sensors in the axial direction during data acquisition. For simplicity, a single sensor and repetitive scans were employed to simulate performance of a sensor array system. The resulting electromagnetic images enable the detection of metal defects that previously have been introduced into the steel pipes. Responses from several sensors were used to assess position and amount of material loss in the first and second metal pipe as well as magnitude of eccentricities between the two pipes. The results from EM measurements and x-ray backscatter simulations demonstrate that data fusion from several sensing modalities can provide an enhanced assessment of flaw structures in producing well bores and potentially allow for early detection of anomalies that if undetected might lead to catastrophic failures...|$|R
40|$|By having {{everything}} in our physical world digitally connected, the Internet of Things is expected to transform how we interact with our environments and unlock tremendous business values through advance analytics. Owing to its low cost, small form factor, {{and its ability to}} communicate without a battery, RFID has emerged as a key enabler for digitally connecting, identifying, and tracking everyday objects. Each year, billions of RFIDs are being deployed to tag retail goods, track pharmaceuticals, and build smart infrastructures. However, core technical challenges in localization and data communication remain to be addressed, before RFID could reach its full potential in the Internet of Things. Today's RFID systems can only identify whether a tagged object is within radio range (up to tens of meters) while lacking the capability to pinpoint its exact location. This dissertation presents three centimeter-scale RFID localization designs, each introducing a set of new techniques and targeting a different application: 1) business analytics and asset management; 2) navigating a robot toward an RFID-tagged object and estimating its position and orientation for manipulation; 3) a virtual touch screen enabled by tracing the detailed trajectory of the RFID on an user's finger to reconstruct her drawing or handwriting in the air. Beyond locating and tracking objects, RFID also holds great potential in forming ultra-low power sensor networks to collect data. A major problem that has challenged this vision is that, unlike WiFi or cellular <b>devices,</b> <b>backscatter</b> RFIDs lack functionalities like carrier sense and rate adaptation, and hence RFID-sensor networks tend to suffer from collisions and inefficient data communication. In this dissertation, instead of considering collision as detrimental and trying to avoid it, we show how to transform collisions into a distributed code across the bits transmitted by a network of RFIDs. We leverage this collision-based code to achieve fast node identification and automatic rate adaptation, improving RFID network reliability and efficiency. by Jue Wang. Thesis: Ph.
