5|$|The case also {{received}} negative treatment in subsequent Supreme Court cases, from Carroll v. United States in 1925, on arrests and vehicle searches, to Atwater v. City of Lago Vista in 2001, holding that an arrest without a warrant, {{even for a}} misdemeanor, is lawful when authorized <b>by</b> <b>statute.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{case has}} been widely cited on the internet, but is no longer {{considered}} good law in {{a growing number of}} jurisdictions. Most states have, either <b>by</b> <b>statute</b> or by case law, removed the unlawful arrest defense for resisting arrest.|$|E
5|$|Assignment {{is an area}} of both English {{contract}} law and the law of real estate that governs the transfer of rights from one party to another. This can include the right to enforce a debt.

Various state and Congressional entities attempted to challenge the administration's closure plans, <b>by</b> <b>statute</b> and in court.|$|E
5|$|The court {{decided that}} the {{evidence}} against Thornton was not overwhelming, and that trial by battle was a permissible option under law; thus Thornton was granted trial by battle. Ashford declined the offer of battle and Thornton was freed from custody. Appeals such as Ashford's were abolished <b>by</b> <b>statute</b> in 1819, and with {{them the right to}} trial by battle. Thornton emigrated to the United States, where he died around 1860.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect of}} these acts on {{aboriginal}} title in California has been a subject of litigation for 150 years. Regardless, the United States never again pursued treaty negotiations with California Indians, instead favoring legislation and executive orders. <b>By</b> <b>statute,</b> Congress created several Indian reservations. Congress gave the executive the discretion to create further reservations. By 1986, Presidents had used this discretion to create 117 reservations totalling 632,000 acres.|$|E
5|$|The {{plaintiff}} {{not being}} a corporation, and having no such corporate name, could not at common law maintain an action. This right, however, was more than 40 years ago conferred <b>by</b> <b>statute,</b> which, among other things, provides that the Seneca Nation of Indians may maintain any action of ejectment to recover the possession of {{any part of the}} Allegany and Cattaraugus reservations unlawfully withheld from them.|$|E
5|$|A {{decision}} {{holding that}} this action could be maintained {{either by the}} tribe, or an individual member thereof on behalf of himself and all others who should come in and contribute, would be contrary to the policy and practice which have been long established in our treatment of the Indian tribes.

5|$|Beshear called another special {{legislative}} session in June 2009 to address another $1 billion shortfall {{in the state}} budget. Later, Beshear amended the call to include the economic incentives package that was not approved during the regular session and, in light of Attorney General Conway's opinion on video lottery terminals, a measure to expand gambling in the state <b>by</b> <b>statute.</b> With the threshold lowered from 60 votes {{for a constitutional amendment}} to 51 votes for a statute, the House of Representatives passed the expanded gambling bill, but the measure died in the Republican-dominated Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee by a 10–5 vote. The amended budget and the economic incentives bills both passed in the 10-day session.|$|E
5|$|Croatia has a {{universal}} health care system, whose roots {{can be traced back}} to the Hungarian-Croatian Parliament Act of 1891, providing a form of mandatory insurance of all factory workers and craftsmen. The population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided <b>by</b> <b>statute</b> and optional insurance. In 2012, annual healthcare related expenditures reached 21.0billion kuna (€2.8billion). Healthcare expenditures comprise only 0.6% of private health insurance and public spending. In 2010, Croatia spent 6.9% of its GDP on healthcare.|$|E
5|$|Legal {{proceedings}} {{began when}} the insurers refused to compensate the owners of Zong. The dispute was initially tried at the Guildhall in London on 6March 1783, with the Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, overseeing the trial before a jury. Mansfield was previously the judge in Somersett's Case in 1772, which concerned the legality of keeping slaves in Britain. He had ruled that slavery had never been established <b>by</b> <b>statute</b> in Britain and was not supported by common law.|$|E

5|$|The Municipal Commissioner is {{the chief}} Executive Officer {{and head of the}} {{executive}} arm of the Municipal Corporation. All executive powers are vested in the Municipal Commissioner who is an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer appointed by the state government. Although the Municipal Corporation is the legislative body that lays down policies for the governance of the city, it is the Commissioner who is responsible for the execution of the policies. The Commissioner is appointed for a fixed term as defined by state statute. The powers of the Commissioner are those provided <b>by</b> <b>statute</b> and those delegated by the Corporation or the Standing Committee.|$|E
5|$|Although {{setting the}} state budget is a {{legislative}} function in many states, Kentucky governors are required <b>by</b> <b>statute</b> to present a proposed biennial budget to the General Assembly for approval shortly after the beginning of its even-year sessions. The governor's budget has often been approved with few changes, but since the Republicans {{took control of the}} state senate {{for the first time in}} 1999, approval has become a much more contentious process. The General Assembly failed to pass a budget before the end of its session in both 2002 and 2004. In both cases, the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by the governor until the legislature could re-convene and pass a budget. In 2005 the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the governor had no authority to expend funds without legislative approval, and that if legislators failed to pass a budget in the future, only expenditures explicitly authorized in the state constitution could be made.|$|E
