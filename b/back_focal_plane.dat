25|$|Samples can exhibit {{diffraction}} contrast, {{whereby the}} electron beam undergoes Bragg scattering, {{which in the}} case of a crystalline sample, disperses electrons into discrete locations in the <b>back</b> <b>focal</b> <b>plane.</b> By the placement of apertures in the <b>back</b> <b>focal</b> <b>plane,</b> i.e. the objective aperture, the desired Bragg reflections can be selected (or excluded), thus only parts of the sample that are causing the electrons to scatter to the selected reflections will end up projected onto the imaging apparatus.|$|E
25|$|Ocular aberrations are {{generally}} measured using a wavefront sensor, {{and the most}} commonly used type of wavefront sensor is the Shack-Hartmann. Ocular aberrations are caused by spatial phase nonuniformities in the wavefront exiting the eye. In a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, these are measured by placing a two-dimensional array of small lenses (lenslets) in a pupil plane conjugate to the eye's pupil, and a CCD chip at the <b>back</b> <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> of the lenslets. The lenslets cause spots to be focused onto the CCD chip, and the positions of these spots are calculated using a centroiding algorithm. The positions of these spots are compared with the positions of reference spots, and the displacements between the two are used to determine the local curvature of the wavefront—an estimate of the phase nonuniformities causing aberration.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} stated, {{by adjusting}} the magnetic lenses such that the <b>back</b> <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> of the lens rather than the imaging plane {{is placed on the}} imaging apparatus a diffraction pattern can be generated. For thin crystalline samples, this produces an image that consists of a pattern of dots {{in the case of a}} single crystal, or a series of rings in the case of a polycrystalline or amorphous solid material. For the single crystal case the diffraction pattern is dependent upon the orientation of the specimen and the structure of the sample illuminated by the electron beam. This image provides the investigator with information about the space group symmetries in the crystal and the crystal's orientation to the beam path. This is typically done without using any information but the position at which the diffraction spots appear and the observed image symmetries.|$|E

2500|$|Figure 1 to {{the right}} is a simple sketch of {{the path of a}} {{parallel}} beam of electrons in a TEM from just above the sample and down the column to the fluorescent screen. [...] As the electrons pass through the sample, they are scattered by the electrostatic potential set up by the constituent elements. After the electrons have left the sample they pass through the electromagnetic objective lens. This lens acts to collect all electrons scattered from one point of the sample in one point on the fluorescent screen, causing an image of the sample to be formed. We note that at the dashed line in the figure, electrons scattered in the same direction by the sample are collected into a single point. This is the <b>back</b> <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> of the microscope, and is where the diffraction pattern is formed. By manipulating the magnetic lenses of the microscope, the diffraction pattern may be observed by projecting it onto the screen instead of the image.

30|$|FIB-SEM is a {{technique}} to generate high resolution three-dimensional images of biological samples in micrometer scale (Kizilyaprak et al., 2014). Samples are prepared by a similar method to transmission electron microscopy, typically by fixing the sample with aldehyde, staining with heavy metals such as osmium and uranium then embedding in an epoxy resin. The surface of the block of resin-embedded sample is imaged by detection of back-scattered electrons. Following imaging, the focused ion beam is used to trim a thin section (typically less than 30  nm) {{from the face of}} the block. After the section is trimmed, the sample block is raised <b>back</b> to the <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> and imaged again.
