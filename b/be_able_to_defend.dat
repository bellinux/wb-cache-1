5|$|On February 13, it was {{announced}} that the Amaury Sport Organisation would not invite Astana to any of their races that season, which included the Tour de France, Paris–Nice, and numerous one-day races. The decision was made because of the doping perpetrated by Astana in its previous seasons; chief among these scandals was the blood doping perpetrated by Alexander Vinokourov in the 2007 Tour de France. The team reacted with surprise and disappointment, particularly since the ban seemed to punish a team that no longer existed, and as a result Contador would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> his Tour de France championship.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{system is}} similar to its predecessor's, with the {{effectiveness}} of an attack dependent on the timing accuracy of separate actions. The battles still consist of turn-based attacks executed by Mario and Luigi, although these are compounded by the babies' actions during an attack. The Bros. movesmoves performed by Mario and Luigi collectivelyhave been replaced by Bros. Items, which are finite attacks that are gained in the overworld. Similar to the Bros. moves, these are more damaging attacks that can be performed by all 4 characters collectively. Only the adults receive damage, even though the babies will become vulnerable once their respective partners have been eliminated from battle. The elimination of babies will also affect battle as some Bros. Items will become disabled, and the party will not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> itself with hammers, which are wielded exclusively by the babies.|$|E
5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} team sent {{north on}} the evening of July 5 reported seeing tanks south of Osan. The team attempted to destroy a tank it spotted in the village of Sojong but was unsuccessful; it suffered one killed (Private Kenneth R. Shadrick) and was forced to return to Pyongtaek. Shortly after, several survivors from Task Force Smith arrived at 1st Battalion's command post telling stories of their defeat at Osan, but Ayres did not believe they were accurate. Brigadier General George B. Barth, acting division artillery commander for the 24th Infantry Division, stopped by the command post and ordered that the battalion hold only as long as it could, and not to risk being flanked or surrounded, wary of the defeat at Osan. Barth then moved to the 34th Infantry Regiment's command where he ordered regimental commander Colonel Jay B. Lovless to consolidate the Regiment at Cheonan to the south. Lovless subsequently moved 3rd Battalion south, without having ever engaged the enemy. Barth believed the 34th Infantry would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> Pyongtaek as long as the 21st Infantry defended Osan. From 3rd Battalion, L Company was detached and ordered to hold south of Pyongtaek to cover the 1st Battalion when it retreated. This order was not carried out, and L Company left for Chonan.|$|E

25|$|Narvik was {{the first}} major allied {{infantry}} victory in the Second World War. Unfortunately for the Norwegians, following the German invasion of France and the Low Countries on 10 May 1940, the Allied task force was withdrawn in early June. Without the support from the Allies, the Norwegian Army alone would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> its positions and a capitulation agreement for mainland Norway was signed.

25|$|The {{relationship}} between the Sikhs and the Mughals further deteriorated following {{the execution of the}} ninth Guru Tegh Bahadur by Aurengzeb, who was highly intolerant of Sikhs, partially driven by his desire to impose Islamic law. Following the executions of their leaders and facing increasing persecution, the Sikhs officially adopted militarization for self-protection by creating the Khalsa; the executions also prompted formalization of various aspects of the Sikh faith. The tenth and final guru, Guru Gobind Singh formally included the kirpan as a mandatory article of faith for all baptised Sikhs, making it a duty for Sikhs to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> themselves and others from oppression.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} in 2007, Whitman stated that Vice President Dick Cheney's insistence on easing air pollution controls, not the personal reasons she cited at the time, led to her resignation. At the time, Cheney pushed the EPA to institute a new rule allowing power plants to make major alterations without installing costly new pollution controls. Whitman stepped down in protest against such demand by the White House, she said. She decided that {{because she did not}} agree with the rule, she would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> it if it were to be challenged in a legal action. The federal court eventually overturned the rule on the ground that it violated the Clean Air Act.|$|E
25|$|Up to 25% of {{military}} burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows. Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya {{points out that}} when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women would have to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During {{the time that the}} Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-hegemony in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.|$|E

25|$|By 1966, the British {{government}} {{had come to}} the conclusion that it could no longer afford to govern what is now the United Arab Emirates. Much deliberation took place in the British parliament, with a number of MPs arguing that the Royal Navy would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> the Trucial Sheikhdoms. Denis Healey, who, at the time, was the UK Secretary of State for Defence, reported that the British Armed Forces were severely overextended, and in some respects, dangerously under-equipped to defend the Sheikhdoms. On 24 January 1968, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced the decision to end the treaty relationships with the seven Trucial Sheikhdoms which had been, together with Bahrain and Qatar, under British protection. The British decision to withdraw was reaffirmed in March 1971 by Prime Minister Edward Heath.|$|E
25|$|Industrial and {{organizational}} psychologists consider innovation, {{more often than}} not, a variable of less importance and often a counter-productive one to include in conducting job performance appraisals when irrelevant to the major job functions for which a given job exists. Nonetheless, I/O psychologists see the value of that variable where its consideration would, were its reliability and validity questioned, achieve a statistically significant probability that its results are not due to chance, and {{that it can be}} replicated reliably with a statistically significant ratio of reliability, and that were a court to raise a question on its reliability and validity testing, the I/O psychologist behind its use would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> it before a court of justice with the belief that it will stand before such a court as reliable, and valid.|$|E
25|$|The Type 1945 {{destroyer}} {{was designed}} in 1945, {{based upon the}} design of the Type 1936D and E destroyers, the plans for which were later accidentally destroyed by fire. Despite the fact that the chance of any project which started after 1942 actually reaching fruition was incredibly low, the Konstruktionsamt (Construction Department) continued to draft ship designs {{until the end of the}} war, on 8 May 1945, with the Type 1945 destroyer being the last of these designs to be created. They were designed to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> against submarines, light naval forces, and aircraft, particularly torpedo bombers. Their design differed greatly from previous ones in that it utilized steam turbines, rather than diesel engines. Overall, their design gave them 12% higher engine performance despite having lighter machinery, and a more powerful main armament with a shorter hull. The project never made it past the drawing board, and no ship of the class was ever ordered or laid down.|$|E
