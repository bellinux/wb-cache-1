40|$|The {{quality of}} hops is {{significantly}} {{affected by the}} content of alpha bitter acids. Maintaining it with minimum losses lies within the competence of both the hop grower and processor depending on how they follow the optimum harvest technology, storage conditions, and post-harvest hop processing. That indicator is considerably affected by the hop storage method, i. e. whether the warehouse is air-conditioned or not, {{as well as the}} storage duration. The alpha <b>bitter</b> <b>acid</b> content should not be reduced during storage. The objective of this paper is an analysis of the alpha <b>bitter</b> <b>acid</b> content in the Saaz hop variety in a technological sequence of operations starting with drying at the grower and finishing with six-month storing at the processor, with three storage variants: an air-conditioned warehouse, non-conditioned warehouse, and a variant in which the square bale is moved after 60 days from a non-conditioned warehouse into an air-conditioned warehouse. The analysis of samples to identify the alpha <b>bitter</b> <b>acid</b> content was carried out by means of the ASBC Hops- 6 and the HPLC EBC 7. 7 methods. Practically in all cases the alpha content declines, although if a square bale is placed in an air-conditioned warehouse this decline is the lowest depending on the storage duration. The economic analysis shows a significant profit referring to the price of alpha contained in 1 t of hops stored in an air-conditioned warehouse. At the date of 1 / 11 / 2015 this profit was 14 706 CZK, at the date of 4 / 1 / 2016 it was 7646 CZK, and at 1 / 3 / 2016 the profit was 6587 CZK...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to develop bitter melon-containing recipes and test their palatability and acceptability in healthy individuals for future clinical studies. Methods A cross-sectional sensory evaluation of bitter melon-containing ethnic recipes was conducted among 50 healthy individuals. The primary endpoints assessed in this analysis were current consumption information and future intentions to consume bitter melon, before and after provision of attribute- and health-specific information. A convenience sample of 50, self-reported non-diabetic adults were recruited from the University of Hawaii. Sensory evaluations were compared using two-way ANOVA, while differences in stage of change (SOC) before and after receiving health information were analyzed by Chi-square (χ 2) analyses. Results Our studies indicate that tomato-based recipes were acceptable to most of the participants and readily acceptable, as compared with recipes containing spices such as curry powder. Health information did not have a significant effect on willingness to consume bitter melon, but positively affected the classification of SOC.

40|$|Iso-α-acids are quantitatively {{the most}} {{important}} hop-derived fraction in beer. In addition to CO 2 and ethanol, iso-α-acids are considered the primary beer flavour components. They impart the typical bitter taste and depending on the desired beer bitterness, their concentration varies from 10 up to 100 mg/L, according to the beer type. This article is to give a review on the knowledge about the formation of iso-α-acids and the mechanisms of their degradation in the beer matrix during storage. Iso-α-acids arise from the isomerisation of hop α-acids during wort boiling. In addition to the isomerisation reaction, the beer’s <b>bitter</b> <b>acids</b> degradation has extensively been studied. Iso-α-acids are subjected to both oxidative and nonoxidative transformations. As a result, both the intensity {{and the quality of}} the beer bitterness are adversely affected. Both trans- and cis-iso-α-acids are susceptible to degradation in the presence of reactive oxygen species and light. Stored in the dark, trans-iso-α-acids in beer were found to be markedly more unstable than their cis-counterparts, and a harshy, lingering bitter taste simultaneously develops. This flavour defect occurring during beer ageing is attributed to the proton-catalysed cyclisation of trans-iso-α-acids into tri- and tetracyclic degradation products. These non-volatile degradation products of trans-iso-α-acids have only recently been identified. In contrast, only few reports deal with the formation of volatiles from iso-α-acids upon beer ageing.

40|$|Explores our tongue 2 ̆ 7 s {{ability to}} detect fat as a {{distinct}} taste similar to our ability to sense sweet, sour, <b>bitter,</b> <b>acid</b> and savory. Abstract Taste is the chemical sense responsible {{for the detection of}} non-volatile chemicals in potential foods. For fat to be considered as one of the taste primaries in humans, certain criteria must be met including class of affective stimuli, receptors specific for the class of stimuli on taste bud cells (TBC), afferent fibres from TBC to taste-processing regions of the brain, perception independent of other taste qualities and downstream physiological effects. The breakdown products of the macronutrients carbohydrates (sugars) and proteins (amino acids) are responsible for the activation of sweet and umami tastes, respectively. Following the same logic, the breakdown products of fat being fatty acids are the likely class of stimuli for fat taste. Indeed, psychophysical studies have confirmed that fatty acids of varying chain length and saturation are orally detectable by humans. The most likely fatty acid receptor candidates located on TBC are CD 36 and G protein-coupled receptor 120. Once the receptors are activated by fatty acids, a series of transduction events occurs causing the release of neurotransmitters towards afferent fibres signalling the brain. Whether fatty acids elicit any direct perception independent of other taste qualities is still open to debate with only poorly defined perceptions for fatty acids reported. Others suggest that the fatty acid taste component is at detection threshold only and any perceptions are associated with either aroma or chemesthesis. It has also been established that oral exposure to fat via sham feeding stimulates increases in blood TAG concentrations in humans. Therefore, overall, with the exception of an independent perception, there is consistent emerging evidence that fat is the sixth taste primary. The implications of fatty acid taste go further into health and obesity research, with the gustatory detection of fats and their contributions to energy and fat intake receiving increasing attention. There appears to be a coordinated bodily response to fatty acids throughout the alimentary canal; those who are insensitive orally are also insensitive in the gastrointestinal tract and overconsume fatty food and energy. The likely mechanism linking fatty acid taste insensitivity with overweight and obesity is development of satiety after consumption of fatty foods...|$|E
40|$|Bitter acids (BA) {{from the}} hop plant Humulus lupulus L. exhibit {{multiple}} beneficial biological properties. However, no studies are available regarding {{the effects of}} hop bitter acids on liver cells or chronic liver diseases, respectively. Chronic liver diseases are accompanied by chronic hepatic inflammation {{which can lead to}} liver fibrosis. If left untreated, liver fibrosis can progress to cirrhosis, which can cause liver failure. Importantly, cirrhosis is also the main risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Both cirrhosis and HCC are associated with high morbidity and mortality, and up until now, no effective treatment options are available. The aim of this thesis was to assess the effects of BA on hepatic stellate cells, the central mediators of liver fibrosis, and on hepatocellular carcinoma cells. First, the effects of hop bitter acids on hepatic stellate cells (HSC) were analyzed. HSC were isolated from murine and human liver tissues and were incubated with a standardized hop <b>bitter</b> <b>acid</b> extract. At a concentration of 25 µg/ml hop bitter acids (BA) started to induce lactate dehydrogenase leakage. Already at lower concentrations BA led to a dose dependent inhibition of HSC proliferation and inhibited IkappaB-alpha-phosphorylation and nuclear p 65 translocation in a dose dependent way. Accordingly, the same doses of BA inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory and NFkappaB-regulated genes, but did not affect expression of genes not related to NFkappaB signaling. In addition to these effects on activated HSC, BA inhibited the in vitro activation of non-activated HSC as evidenced by delayed expression of collagen I and alpha-sma mRNA and protein. Together, these findings indicate that BA inhibit NFkappaB activation, and herewith, the activation and development of pro-fibrogenic phenotype of HSC in vitro. Next, we analyzed the effects of BA on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Here, we used two different standardized BA extracts enriched for either alpha-acids or beta-acids to get a first insight whether biological activity vary between these two groups of bitter acids. At a concentration of 25 µg/ml, only the beta-acid rich extract started to induce aspartate aminotransferase (AST) release as marker for cell injury, whereas at a dose of 50 µg/ml both extracts led to a significant increase of AST liberation. Already at lower concentrations both extracts dose-dependently inhibited proliferation and migration of HCC cells. Analysis of different signaling pathways revealed an inhibition of ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation, down-regulation of AP- 1 activity and an alleviation of NFkappaB activity in HCC cells in vitro. Hereby, the beta-acid rich extract showed more pronounced effects. Furthermore, the stability of BA in a rodent chow supplemented with an alpha-acid rich extract was assessed applying high pressure liquid chromatography diode array detection technology. Mimicking feasible storage conditions we observed a very poor recovery, indicative of a strong degradation of BA. This prompted us not to proceed with application of this particular BA supplemented chow in rodent models, since in addition to imprecise BA-concentration also potential ill-defined degradation products would not have allowed a sound interpretation of such studies. In conclusion, hop bitter acids alleviate the pro-fibrogenic phenotype of hepatic stellate cells and inhibit central signaling pathways, which are known to play important roles in tumor development and progression, in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. These data suggest the potential use of hop bitter acids as functional nutrient or therapeutical agent for both prevention and treatment of chronic liver diseases. Further studies are needed to verify the beneficial effects in experimental models of liver injury in vivo. However, analysis of a newly designed BA-supplemented experimental chow for rodents revealed strong degradation processes even under optimal storage conditions. Therefore, special care has to be taken when planning long term BA-application experiments. ...|$|E
