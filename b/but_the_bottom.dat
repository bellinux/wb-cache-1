5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|A garrote (made from {{a length}} of nylon cord and the broken handle of a paintbrush) was tied around JonBenét's neck and had {{apparently}} been used to strangle her.

25|$|The top {{and left}} {{edge of a}} JPEG image must lie on an 8×8 pixel block boundary, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> and right edge need not do so. This limits the {{possible}} lossless crop operations, and also prevents flips and rotations of an image whose bottom or right edge does not lie on a block boundary for all channels (because the edge would end up on top or left, where– as aforementioned– a block boundary is obligatory).|$|E

25|$|The movie {{takes place}} everywhere, {{and it takes}} place nowhere. It's a city built of pieces of cities. A corner from one place, another from some place else. So, you don't really know where you are.

25|$|When {{fastening}} a three-button suit, {{the middle}} button is fastened, {{and the top}} one sometimes, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> is traditionally not designed to be (although in the past some jackets were cut {{so that it could}} be fastened without distorting the drape; {{this is not the case}} with current clothing). A four-button suit is untraditional and so has no traditional guidelines on buttoning, but the middle ones at least should be fastened. Additionally, the one button suit has regained some popularity (it is also one of the classic styles of Savile Row tailoring). The button should always be fastened while standing.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the plain}} view {{doctrine}} {{as defined in}} Coolidge v. New Hampshire (1971), if an officer is lawfully present, he may seize objects that are in [...] "plain view". However, the officer must have had probable cause {{to believe that the}} objects are contraband. What's more, the criminality of the object in plain view must be obvious by its very nature. In Arizona v. Hicks, the Supreme Court held that an officer stepped beyond the plain view doctrine when he moved a turntable in order to view its serial number to confirm that the turntable was stolen. [...] "A search is a search", proclaimed the Court, [...] "even if it happens to disclose nothing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of a turntable." ...|$|E

500|$|Pilotwings 64 {{was well}} {{received}} by most reviewers. The game's combination of 3D graphics, realistic settings, and flight simulation were applauded by many news sources and major gaming publications. In his release {{review of the}} Nintendo 64, The Seattle Times contributor Steven L. Kent found that the flight mechanics and vast areas featured in Pilotwings 64 make {{it one of the}} most impressive games ever made. Glenn Rubenstein of the website GameSpot summarized, [...] "The graphics, sound, control, and all around excitement add up to make Pilotwings 64 one hell of a great ride." [...] Staff reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly, GamePro, and IGN all voiced positive comments on the game's polygon rendering and frame rates, as well as its sense of control and flying. Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games enjoyed the game's large environments, exclaiming, [...] "You'll not believe just how huge the islands really are and, because certain elements are hidden at first, it'll take you months to see everything." [...] IGN's Levi Buchanan described this low-pressure, [...] "challenge without competition" [...] aspect of the game as a design philosophy adopted by later Nintendo titles such as Nintendogs. Rich Leadbetter of Maximum said that [...] "The sedate nature of the gameplay might not appeal to everyone, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> line is that PilotWings 64 is an unparalleled test of skill, dexterity and control. It is a game that you must own and whilst not quite in the same league of 'must-have'itude as Super Mario 64, it remains an astounding achievement and another triumph for Nintendo." [...] A Next Generation critic remarked that once beyond the introductory missions the game becomes satisfyingly challenging, and succeeds as both a flight simulation and an example of Nintendo's surrealistic gameplay: [...] "It's a weird mix of total realism and self-conscious videogame elements, and the two don't grate." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was at Tres Zapotes in 1939 that Stirling found Stela C. [...] The {{top half}} of the {{monument}} was missing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> half produced a Long Count date of ?.16.6.16.18. [...] If the first digit was a [...] "7" [...] then the date would correlate to 32 BCE, a date {{considered by many to be}} too early for a Mesoamerican civilization. [...] An [...] "8" [...] would mean a date of 363 CE. [...] The Stirlings opted for the earlier date, to the consternation of many in the archaeological community.|$|E
2500|$|Although snow covers Crater Lake National Park {{for eight}} {{months of the year}} (average annual {{snowfall}} is [...] ), the lake rarely freezes over due in part to a relatively mild onshore flow from the Pacific Ocean. The last recorded year in which the lake froze over was in 1949, a very long, cold winter. A 95% surface freeze occurred in 1985. The immense depth of Crater Lake acts as a heat reservoir that absorbs and traps sunlight, maintaining the lake temperature at an average of [...] on the surface and [...] at the bottom throughout the year. The surface temperature fluctuates a bit, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> temperature remains quite constant.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2006, some {{listeners}} of the Dennis and Callahan Show {{were upset}} when they conducted an in studio interview with Kevin Weeks, {{a former member}} of Whitey Bulger's South Boston based criminal organization. [...] Weeks had admitted to committing armed and unarmed assaults, kidnappings and being an accessory to several murders on behalf of Whitey Bulger and had played a role helping Bulger escape arrest. His appearance on the show was to promote his book, Brutal : The Untold Story of My Life Inside Whitey Bulger's Irish Mob (...) [...] Some listeners felt that it was wrong for the show to help Weeks promote his book. Callahan told the Boston Herald that they wrestled with whether to [...] "put this thug on air."

2500|$|The Armed Forces Chaplaincy Center, {{the site}} of Chaplain Corps {{training}} for the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force at Fort Jackson, Columbia, South Carolina, includes the partially destroyed sign from the Beirut barracks chapel as a memorial to those {{who died in the}} attack. According to Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff, one of the navy chaplains present during the attack, [...] "Amidst the rubble, we found the plywood board which we had made for our [...] "Peace-keeping Chapel." [...] The Chaplain Corps Seal had been hand-painted, with the words [...] "Peace-keeping" [...] above it, and [...] "Chapel" [...] beneath.

2500|$|When {{asked how}} he beat his addictions, Cornell stated, [...] "It was {{a long period of}} coming to the {{realization}} that this way (sober) is better.

There’s nothing you can do...if your best friend has a problem and it's very serious, there's nothing you're {{going to be able to}} do about it and it was sad for me and the people around me.

2500|$|On 28 October, after {{performing}} on V Graham Norton {{to promote the}} Singles compilation, Anderson {{made the decision to}} call it a day. This decision coincided with the release of the band's biography, Love and Poison on 3 November. On 5 November, the band announced {{that there would be no}} more projects under the Suede name for the foreseeable future – effectively announcing the end of the band, as they stated on their website: [...] "There will not be a new studio album until the band feel that the moment is artistically right to make one." [...] Anderson also made a personal statement saying: [...] "There has been speculation about record sales and chart positions, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> line is I need to do whatever it takes to get my demon back." [...] Suede's last concert at the London Astoria on 13 December 2003 was a two-and-a-half-hour marathon show, split into two parts plus encore. Anderson made an announcement, saying, [...] "I just want you to know. There will be another Suede record. But not yet." [...] Later, Osman would reveal that as they were walking to the studio set, Anderson whispered into his ear: [...] "Let's not do this anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{securing}} press credentials {{for herself}} and a photographer, and after visiting Peru's Congress to interview some of its members and attend sessions where she took notes and sketched a seating plan, Berenson was arrested on a public bus along with the photographer. Her photographer {{turned out to be}} the wife of a top MRTA leader, a fact which Berenson stated she was unaware of at that time. The MRTA is alleged to have intended to use the information to seize lawmakers and exchange the hostages for imprisoned MRTA members. The house she rented in Lima was found to contain an arsenal of weapons and ammunition, together with armed guerrillas who violently resisted capture. She denied knowing of the presence of either the weaponry or the guerillas, and she also denied knowing that the documents she prepared would be used for terrorism. In 2011 she admitted that she had known that her associates were MRTA members and she said: [...] "It might not have been intentional, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> line is: I did collaborate with them." [...] In the same interview she maintained that she had not been aware that weapons were being amassed in the upper floors of her house which she had sublet to the MRTA members, and she also maintained that she was unaware that violent actions were being planned at the Congress, stating that [...] "at that time in Fujimori’s dictatorship, Congress was the only place that there was some sort of democratic process." ...|$|E

6000|$|P.S. In {{the case}} of the Cumberland poet, I {{overlooked}} a most pathetic circumstance.
