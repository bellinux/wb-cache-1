5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate the Church of God with Signs and Wonders, a church where the Bible is read literally, and punishment is dealt deftly, after a small town church {{is the site of}} a number of ritualistic-like murders. But soon the agents realize that the difference between the peaceful religious and the fanatics may not <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Gliese 581c and its mass have been {{measured by the}} radial velocity method of detecting extrasolar planets. The mass of a planet is calculated by the small periodic movements around a common centre of mass between the host star Gliese 581 and its planets. When all six planets are fitted with a Keplerian solution, the minimum mass of the planet is determined to be 5.5 Earth masses. The radial velocity method cannot by itself determine the true mass, but it cannot <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> larger than this or the system would be dynamically unstable. Dynamical simulations of the Gliese 581 system which assume the orbits of the planets are coplanar indicate that the planets cannot exceed approximately 1.6 to 2 times their minimum masses or the planetary system would be unstable (this is primarily due to the interaction between planets e and b). For Gliese 581c, the upper bound is 10.4 Earth masses.|$|E

25|$|The Indian wars {{under the}} {{government}} of the United States have been more than 40 in number. They have cost the lives of about 19,000 white men, women and children, including those killed in individual combats, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians. The actual number of killed and wounded Indians must <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> higher than the given... Fifty percent additional would be a safe estimate...|$|E

25|$|While {{some reports}} have also {{indicated}} {{the presence of}} retired Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) personnel as advisers, there is no official cooperation between the ROC military and the JSDF. It is believed that any Japanese involvement in a cross-Straits conflict would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> contingent upon the US response, due to the nearest US forces in the region being based in Japan and the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan.|$|E

25|$|The paper {{concludes with}} {{comparisons}} of the vegetation of the Congo with those of West Africa, South Africa, St. Helena and Madagascar; West Africa is found to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> similar, and South Africa remarkably different. Comparisons are then made with South America, and consideration is given to how certain distributions might have come about. Noting that the collection contains around 250 new species and about 32 new genera, yet no new family, Brown concludes with the observation {{that there are no}} plant families endemic to tropical Africa.|$|E
25|$|In medieval Europe, Thomas Aquinas {{accepted}} Aristotle's {{view and}} so, reluctantly, did John Buridan and Nicole Oresme in the fourteenth century. Not until Nicolaus Copernicus in 1543 adopted a heliocentric world system did the contemporary understanding of earth's rotation {{begin to be}} established. Copernicus pointed out that if {{the movement of the}} earth is violent, then the movement of the stars must <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> more so. He acknowledged the contribution of the Pythagoreans and pointed to examples of relative motion. For Copernicus this was the first step in establishing the simpler pattern of planets circling a central sun.|$|E
25|$|Rømer then {{applies the}} same logic to {{observations}} around the first quadrature (pointG), when Earth is moving towards Jupiter. The time difference between an immersion seen from pointF and the next immersion seen from pointG should be 3½minutes shorter than the true orbital period of Io. Hence, {{there should be a}} difference of about 7minutes between the periods of Io measured at the first quadrature and those measured at the second quadrature. In practice, no difference is observed at all, from which Rømer concludes that the speed of light must <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> greater than one Earth-diameter per second.|$|E

25|$|After World War I, Allen County's {{population}} growth lagged {{the state and}} the nation. Galvin was an assistant superintendent at the Peru Steel Casting Co. of Peru, Ind. He then became acting manager at American Steel Foundries in Pittsburgh. In 1921, Lima voters approved a change in the structure of Lima city government. Voters now elected five commissioners, with the commission chair serving as mayor. The charter sought to establish professional management, requiring the commissioners to hire a city manager, who reported to the mayor. Lima proved itself to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in the Progressive tradition with these changes, after flirting with radicalism in 1912 when the voters elected a Socialist mayor.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds {{of people}} {{gathered}} on the route to pay their last respects to Swami Lakshmanananda. Riots erupted when the procession passed through localities with Christian populations. Christians, who were perceived to be Indian National Congress party supporters, were targeted everywhere; in some places many Hindu families were also attacked because they were Congress supporters. The attackers included activists of the VHP, the Bajrang Dal and other Sangh Parivar organisations, and workers of the BJP that was {{a partner in the}} government headed by Naveen Patnaik. The violence also saw attacks on Christians who belonged to the Scheduled Castes and on people who claimed tribal status {{on the grounds that they}} spoke the Kui language of the Kondha tribal people. The Kui Samaj, which unites members of the native Kondh tribe in Kandhamal, was found to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> on the side of the VHP and the ruling alliance.|$|E
25|$|In {{all three}} of these situations, a guide line or {{lifeline}} from the exit to the diver is the standard method of reducing the risk of being unable to find the way out. A lifeline fixed to the diver is more reliable as {{it is not easy to}} lose, and is often used when diving under ice, where the line is unlikely to snag and the distance is reasonably short, and can be tended by a person at the surface. Static guidelines are more suitable when a lifeline is likely to snag on the environment or on other divers in the group, and may be left in situ to be used for other dives, or recovered on the way out by winding back onto the reel. Guide lines may <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> longer than lifelines, and may be branched and marked. They are used as standard practice for cave diving and wreck penetration.|$|E

25|$|A town {{grew up in}} {{the shadow}} of the castle, made up {{primarily}} of settlers from England. Cardiff had a population of between 1,500 and 2,000 in the Middle Ages, a relatively normal size for a Welsh town in this period. It was the centre of the Norman Marcher Lordship of Glamorgan and by the end of the 13th century, Cardiff was the only town in Wales with a population exceeding 2,000, although it remained relatively small compared with most notable towns in the Kingdom of England, and continued to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> contained by its walls, which has begun as a wooden palisade in the early 12th century. It was none-the-less of sufficient size and importance to be awarded a series of charters, notably in 1331 by William La Zouche, Lord of Glamorgan through marriage with the de Clare family, Edward III in 1359, then Henry IV in 1400, and later Henry VI. In no small part due to the historic Anglicisation of the town, in 1404 Owain Glyndŵr burned Cardiff and took possession of the Castle. As many buildings in the town were made of timber, and tightly packed together within the town walls, much of Cardiff was destroyed. Ironically given the treatment of Cardiff by Glyndwr, a statue of him was erected in Cardiff Town Hall in the early twentieth century, reflecting the complex and often conflicting cultural identity Cardiff has as the capital of Wales. However, the town was soon rebuilt on the same street plan and began to flourish once again. In addition to serving an important political role in the governance of the fertile south Glamorgan coastal plain, Cardiff was a busy port in the Middle Ages due to its location on the Bristol trading routes, and was declared a Staple port in 1327. This furthermore led to the town gaining a reputation for piracy, which by the Early Modern period led to much dispute between the burgesses of Cardiff and the surrounding county families.|$|E

Second season filming, which began in New York on July 13, 2016, was shot at Silvercup Studios and on location. Filming ended in mid-March 2017. Certain scenes of the third-season premiere will be shot on location in Italy. Filming for the third season started on October 10, 2017.|$|E

500|$|Palmer's {{interest}} in the Shaver Mystery did not abate when he left Amazing Stories, and the lead story for {{the first issue of}} Other Worlds was Shaver's [...] "The Fall of Lemuria", still presented as truth in the guise of fiction. [...] The cover illustration was by Malcolm Smith, a frequent artist for Amazing. [...] Palmer declared in the first issue that he wanted to present science fiction from across the spectrum: hard-science stories of the kind that appeared in Astounding Science Fiction, and stories representative of the styles of the other leading magazines—Amazing, Planet Stories, and Thrilling Wonder Stories. Despite this many of the stories in the first issue were routine. [...] Much of the first issue's contents were by Amazing regulars, and it initially appeared that the new magazine would not <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> different from Palmer's Amazing Stories, but within a few issues the quality improved noticeably.|$|E
500|$|Interviewed in January 2006, Chambers foreshadowed major {{developments}} for his character when he stated: [...] "I think Sam's ideal woman might be Connie because she's feisty, doesn't beat around {{the bush and}} is very talented, which is always sexy. However I reckon they clash quite a lot because she manipulates with her power play and won't drop the act so it would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> on a love hate basis." [...] The two characters went on to have a brief sexual relationship, resulting in Connie becoming pregnant with Sam's child. Once the revelation of Connie's pregnancy had been made, Chambers asserted of {{the tension between the}} separated couple: [...] "Some of the scenes with Connie work amazingly well because we do genuinely get worked up and we like {{to keep it that way}} until filming is finished. It's a useful tip to let the frustrations come through in your work - it makes good viewing." ...|$|E
500|$|On 10 November 2005, Julia Day from The Guardian {{reported}} ITV controller of drama, Nick Elliott, {{had ordered}} three new adaptations of Mansfield Park, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion. Elliot {{commented that the}} adaptations would be [...] "important remakes for the new generation". He explained, [...] "About every 10 years, all the great stories need retelling. These films will <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> 2007 films... we've asked and pushed the production team to make them young. Her stories always make great TV drama and our Jane Austen season will feature the absolute cream of British acting talent." [...] Elliott revealed that he had deliberately shied away from ordering adaptations of Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility to focus on Austen's lesser known works. Each of the productions were made by a different company, cast and directors, so they had [...] "a distinct look". They were also made {{to appeal to a}} younger audience that might have previously switched off other Austen adaptations. Northanger Abbey was given a budget of £2 million, and it marked only the second filmed adaptation of the book; with the first being made and broadcast in 1986.|$|E
