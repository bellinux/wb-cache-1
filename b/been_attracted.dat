5|$|Direct {{evidence}} for the domestication of cats 5,300 years ago in Quanhucun, China has been published by archaeologists and paleontologists from the University of Washington and Chinese Academy of Sciences. The cats {{are believed to have}} <b>been</b> <b>attracted</b> to the village by rodents, which in turn were attracted by grain cultivated and stored by humans.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a serious}} {{allegation}} to make against a physician. Reich wrote in his diary that the mother had <b>been</b> <b>attracted</b> to him and had made the allegation to damage him. She later committed suicide and Reich blamed himself. If Kahn did have an abortion, Turner wrote, {{she was the first}} of four of Reich's partners to do so: his first wife had several, and his long-term partners Elsa Lindenberg and Ilse Ollendorf (his second wife) each had one at Reich's insistence.|$|E
5|$|Musically, glam metal {{combines}} a traditional heavy metal sound with elements of hard rock and punk rock, adding pop-influenced catchy hooks and guitar riffs. Like other heavy metal {{songs of the}} 1980s, they often feature shred guitar solos. They also include extensive use of harmonies, particularly in the characteristic power balladsslow, emotional songs that gradually build to a strong finale. These {{were among the most}} commercially successful singles in the genre and opened it up to a wider audience that would not have <b>been</b> <b>attracted</b> to traditional heavy metal. Lyrical themes often deal with love and lust, with songs often directed at a particular woman.|$|E

5|$|The {{private sector}} has {{also played a}} large role in revitalizing the area, even without public aid and incentives. Developers have <b>been</b> <b>attracted</b> to the {{historic}} buildings and their surrounding neighborhoods, calling it the city's strongest asset, although they have complained about past stalemates in city government. One initiative has often led to others. River Street's development into a center for antique stores came about without any public effort or intent, and the restoration of the music hall at the Savings Bank led to many new restaurants opening in the neighborhood. The blocks of River Street north of Monument Square have a dozen woman-owned businesses.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{devoted his}} life entirely to his profession, {{remaining}} single. He {{is known to have}} <b>been</b> <b>attracted</b> to only one woman—Josefa Moreu, teacher at the Mataró Cooperative, in 1884—but this was not reciprocated. Thereafter Gaudí took refuge in the profound spiritual peace his Catholic faith offered him. Gaudí is often depicted as unsociable and unpleasant, a man of gruff reactions and arrogant gestures. However, those who were close to him described him as friendly and polite, pleasant to talk to and faithful to friends. Among these, his patrons Eusebi Güell and the bishop of Vic, Josep Torras i Bages, stand out, as well as the writers Joan Maragall and Jacint Verdaguer, the physician Pere Santaló and some of his most faithful collaborators, such as Francesc Berenguer and Llorenç Matamala.|$|E
5|$|Millhouse was a vocal {{advocate}} of his broader constituency, championing their {{case in a}} party dominated by rural conservatives. He {{wrote a paper on}} the 'Liberal Case for Electoral Reform', arguing for a fairer electoral system, as it was biased against voters resident in the capital city, Adelaide, whether they be progressive or conservative, Liberal or Labor. Many younger urban middle class voters, who would have normally <b>been</b> <b>attracted</b> to the LCL, were abandoning the party for Labor owing to their dissatisfaction with the malapportioned electoral system known as the 'Playmander'. But this concerned the rural conservatives little, who hoped to retain their hold on power through the present system, which included a Legislative Council where suffrage was based on land ownership, resulting in a body dominated by the ruling class and the rural landholders, and a 16–4 LCL majority. Millhouse's paper was quickly ignored.|$|E

5|$|In 1732, John Strachan built Redland Court for John Cossins. It now forms {{one of the}} {{buildings}} making up Redland High School for Girls. In 1760, the Bristol Bridge Act was carried through parliament by the Bristol MP Sir Jarrit Smyth. That led to the demolition of St Nicholas's Gate, along with the original St Nicholas church, part of the Old Shambles, and thirty houses that stood on the old bridge. The original bridge was a medieval wooden structure, lined with houses on both sides. A 17th-century illustration shows that these were five stories high, including the attic rooms, and that they overhung the river much as Tudor houses would overhang the street. At {{the time of the}} Civil War the bridge was noted for its community of goldsmiths, who may have <b>been</b> <b>attracted</b> by the unusually secure premises. The current St Nicholas church was rebuilt in 1762–9 by James Bridges and Thomas Paty, who rebuilt the spire. Part of the old church and town wall survives in the 14th century crypt.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June, Monmouth's army encamped at Pensford, {{and a small}} force skirmished {{with the}} Gloucester Militia {{to take control of}} Keynsham, a vital {{crossing}} point over the River Avon. Monmouth intended to attack the city of Bristol (the largest and most important city after London at that time). However, he heard the city had been occupied by Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort. There were inconclusive skirmishes with a force of Life Guards commanded by Feversham. These attacks gave the impression that there was a much larger royalist force in the vicinity then there actually was. Several historians have speculated that if Monmouth had marched as quickly as possible for Bristol at this point, when it was only protected by the Gloucestershire militia, he would probably have been able to take the city and the final outcome of the rebellion might have been very different. Once Bristol had been taken, more recruits would have <b>been</b> <b>attracted</b> to the Rebellion and a later march on London would have been possible.|$|E

25|$|King Aśoka convened {{the third}} Buddhist council around 250 BC at Pataliputra (today's Patna). It {{was held by}} the monk Moggaliputtatissa.

Following the council, Buddhist missionaries were dispatched throughout the known world.|$|E

50|$|In The 16 Strivings for God Reiss {{develops}} {{the theory that}} people embrace religion because it provides them with opportunities to satisfy all 16 basic desires both in strong form and in weak form. For example, {{a person with a}} weak basic desire for social contact might <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> to religious retreats, while a person with a strong basic desire for Social Contact might <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> to religious festivals. A person with a weak basic desire for Vengeance might <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> to passages in scriptures that speak of peace and forgiveness, while a person with a strong basic desire for Vengeance might <b>be</b> <b>attracted</b> to passages that speak of revenge.|$|R

25|$|Writing {{two weeks}} after the Beatles' visit, Joaquin commented that the Philippines had <b>been</b> <b>attracted</b> to the band's image without appreciating that, behind the image, their message was one advocating individuality, adventurousness and {{originality}} over tradition and order. Joaquin cited this underestimation as the cause of the Beatles' recent problems and likened the group's presence in Manila to Batman being transplanted to Thebes in Ancient Greece.|$|E
25|$|The arguably most {{influential}} of Pătrășcanu's writings remains {{his analysis of}} the Romanian intelligentsia, part of Probleme de bază ale României. Transcending Leninist rhetoric, the work postulates a characteristic inability of Romanian intellectuals in sacrificing petty politics for the common good, and argues that Romanian elites, while in subservience to the State, have traditionally <b>been</b> <b>attracted</b> to extremism. On one instance in 1945, when theorizing about intellectual déclassés, he proposed their neutralization and systematic supervision".|$|E

25|$|Beethoven's {{personal}} life {{was troubled by}} his encroaching deafness and irritability brought on by chronic abdominal pain (beginning in his twenties), which led him to contemplate suicide (documented in his Heiligenstadt Testament). Beethoven was often irascible. It has been suggested he had bipolar disorder.

Towards {{the end of his}} life, Beethoven's friends competed in their efforts to help him cope with his incapacities.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} Poe and Osgood first met in person when introduced by Nathaniel Parker Willis in March 1845 when Osgood had {{been separated from}} (but not divorced from) her husband. Poe's wife, Virginia, was still alive, but in ill health. Poe may have <b>been</b> <b>attracted</b> to Osgood because they were both born in Boston and possibly due to her childlike qualities which were similar to Virginia's. She may have already been in {{an early stage of}} tuberculosis, just like Virginia.|$|E
