50|$|The black-knobbed map <b>turtle</b> (<b>Graptemys</b> nigrinoda), {{formerly}} known as the black-knobbed sawback, is a small to medium-sized aquatic turtle with light gray skin. Some of the most distinguishing characteristics of the black-knobbed map <b>turtle,</b> and the <b>Graptemys</b> genus, are the protruding “spikes” on the turtle’s carapace. This species inhabits mainly the fall lines of rivers in the Mobile Bay drainage, in Alabama and Mississippi.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bog</b> <b>turtle.</b> The 1981 Green Brook Sub-basin Flood Control: Environmental Impact Statement stated: [...] The <b>bog</b> <b>turtle,</b> Clemys muhlenbergi, {{has been}} {{classified}} as {{an endangered species}} in the State of New Jersey since the first state list of rare and endangered species appeared in 1971.

Potential <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> habitat also exists in the Blue Brook Valley.|$|R
50|$|CWF assists {{with the}} {{restoration}} and enhancement of <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> habitats in New Jersey. Biologists visit <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> sites and evaluate their habitat's status. <b>Bog</b> <b>turtle</b> habitats {{are susceptible to}} dangerous side effects by invasive plants. Some methods used to control these problems are using wetland approved herbicides, and controlled grazing by farm animals.|$|R
5|$|The {{spotted turtle}} and painted turtle {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle.</b> The <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> is distinguishable from any other species of turtle by the distinctively colored blotch on its neck. A major difference {{between it and the}} spotted turtle is that the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> has no coloration on the upper shell, unlike the latter species.|$|R
5|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{is another}} method of stabilizing the bog turtles' numbers. The technique involves mating <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> indoors in controlled environments, where nutrition and mates are provided. Fred Wustholz and Richard J. Holub {{were the first}} to do this independently, during the 1960s and 1970s. They were interested in educating others about the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> and in increasing its population, and over several years they released many healthy <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> into the wild. Various organizations, such as the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, have been permitted to breed <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> in captivity.|$|R
50|$|Two {{sites are}} {{important}} because they provide habitat for the <b>Bog</b> <b>Turtle</b> (Glyptemys muhlenbergii). The <b>Bog</b> <b>Turtle</b> {{is the single most}} significant rare animal species surviving in Gaston County.|$|R
5|$|The <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> is {{primarily}} diurnal, active {{during the day}} and sleeping at night. It wakes in the early morning, basks until fully warm, then begins its search for food. It is a seclusive species, making it challenging to observe in its natural habitat. During colder days, the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> will spend much of its time in dense underbrush, underwater, or buried in mud. Such behavior is indicative of the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle's</b> ability to survive without oxygen. On warmer days, the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle's</b> activities include scavenging, mating (during early spring), and basking in sunlight, the last of which it spends {{a great deal of the}} day doing. However, the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> usually takes shelter from the sun during the hottest part of the day. Occasionally, during times of extreme heat, the turtle will either estivate, or become subterranean, sometimes occupying networks of tunnels filled with water. At night, the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> buries itself in soft tunnels.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bog</b> <b>turtle's</b> {{karyotype}} {{is composed}} of 50 chromosomes.Studies of variations in mitochondrial DNA indicate low levels of genetic divergence among <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> colonies. This is unusual in species such as the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle,</b> which have fragmented distributions and exist in small isolated groups (fewer than 50 individuals in <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> colonies). These conditions limit gene flow, typically leading to divergence between isolated groups. Data indicate that the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> suffered dramatic reductions in numbers - a population bottleneck - as colonies were forced south {{in the face of}} glaciation. Receding glaciers led to the relatively recent post-Pleistocene expansion, as the <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> moved back into their former northern range. This recent colonization from a relatively limited southern population may account for the reduction of genetic diversity. The northern and southern populations are at present genetically isolated, likely as a consequence of farming and habitat destruction in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War.|$|R
5|$|Today, the {{rebounding}} of <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> colonies {{depends on}} private intervention. Population monitoring involves meticulous land surveys over vast countrysides. In addition to surveying land visually, remote sensing {{has been used}} to biologically classify a wetland as either suitable or unsuitable for a <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> colony.

500|$|Adult <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> weigh [...] on average. Their {{skins and}} shells are {{typically}} dark brown, with a distinctive orange spot {{on each side}} of the neck. Considered threatened at the federal level, the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> is protected under the United States' Endangered Species Act. Invasive plants and urban development have eradicated much of the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle's</b> habitat, substantially reducing its numbers. Demand for the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> is high in the black market pet trade, partly because of its small size and unique characteristics. Various private projects have been undertaken in an attempt to reverse the decline in the turtle's population.|$|R
500|$|Protected {{under the}} United States Federal Endangered Species Act, the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> is {{considered}} threatened in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania as of November 4, 1997. Due to a [...] "similarity of appearance" [...] {{to the northern}} population, the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> is also threatened in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia (considered to be the southern population). In addition to the federal listing of threatened, states in the southern range list the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> as either endangered or threatened. Changes to the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle's</b> habitat {{have resulted in the}} disappearance of 80percent of the colonies that existed 30years ago. Because of the turtle's rarity, it is also in danger of illegal collection, often for the worldwide pet trade. Despite regulations prohibiting their collection, barter, or export, <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> are commonly taken by poachers. Road traffic has also led to declines. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has a plan for the recovery of the northern population. The <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> was listed as critically endangered in the 2011 IUCN Red List.|$|R
5|$|Rushes, tussock sedge, cattails, jewelweed, sphagnum, {{and various}} native true grasses {{are found in}} the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle's</b> habitat, as well as some shrubs and trees such as willows, red maples, and alders. It is {{important}} for their habitat to have an open canopy, because <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> spend a considerable amount of time basking in the sunlight. An open canopy allows sufficient sunlight to reach the ground so that the <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> can manage their metabolic processes through thermoregulation. The incubation of eggs also requires levels of sunlight and humidity that shaded areas typically lack. The ideal <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> habitat is early successional. Late successional habitats contain taller trees that block the necessary sunlight. Erosion and runoff of nutrients into the wetlands accelerate succession. Changes caused by humans have begun to eliminate <b>bog</b> <b>turtles</b> from areas where they would normally survive.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Protecting {{the natural}} {{environment}} while fostering local development {{is one of the}} main challenges that engineers face today. New species are added to the federally threatened and endangered species list as their habitats are destroyed by residential and commercial development. The <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> (clemmys muhlenbergif) is threatened by new development that damages not only its wetland habitat, but also the upland areas that drain to the wetlands. As part of a biological assessment of <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> habitats, the Maryland State Highway Administration commissioned Parsons Brinckerhoff to perform a hydrologic analysis for several <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> habitats that may be impacted by a proposed highway bypass and commerciaVindustria 1 development. The analysis included an extensive field monitoring network throughout the 8. 8 km 2 watershed. The field data were used to develop and calibrate groundwater and surface water flow models. These models were used to develop a water budget for the <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> habitats for the existing condition and a series of proposed conditions. These results provided state and local planners with estimates of seasonal average groundwater table elevations and streamflows which will be used to develop the first major <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> preserve in the State of Maryland. This information will be valuable to other Mid-Atlantic States that are facing similar declines in their <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> habitats and populations.

5|$|The <b>bog</b> <b>turtle</b> spends {{its life}} almost {{exclusively}} in the wetland where it hatched. In its natural environment, it has a maximum lifespan of perhaps 50 years or more, and the average lifespan is 20–30 years. The Bronx Zoo houses several turtles 35years old or more, the oldest known <b>bog</b> <b>turtles.</b> The zoo's collection has successfully sustained itself for more than 35years.
