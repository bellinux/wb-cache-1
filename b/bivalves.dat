5|$|<b>Bivalves</b> {{have long}} {{been a part of}} the diet of coastal and {{riparian}} human populations. Oysters were cultured in ponds by the Romans, and mariculture has more recently become an important source of <b>bivalves</b> for food. Modern knowledge of molluscan reproductive cycles has led to the development of hatcheries and new culture techniques. A better understanding of the potential hazards of eating raw or undercooked shellfish has led to improved storage and processing. Pearl oysters (the common name of two very different families in salt water and fresh water) are the most common source of natural pearls. The shells of <b>bivalves</b> are used in craftwork, and the manufacture of jewellery and buttons. <b>Bivalves</b> have also been used in the biocontrol of pollution.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods are shelled {{marine organisms}} that superficially resembled <b>bivalves</b> {{in that they}} are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very {{different}} ancestral line, and the resemblance to <b>bivalves</b> only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The {{differences between the two groups}} are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as common as <b>bivalves.</b>|$|E

5|$|Carnivorous <b>bivalves</b> have {{a greatly}} reduced style, and a chitinous gizzard that helps grind {{up the food}} before digestion. In other ways, their gut {{is similar to that}} of filter-feeding <b>bivalves.</b>|$|E
5|$|For a long time, <b>bivalves</b> {{were thought}} to be better adapted to aquatic life than brachiopods were, outcompeting and relegating them to minor niches in later ages. These two taxa {{appeared}} in textbooks as an example of replacement by competition. Evidence given for this included the fact that <b>bivalves</b> needed less food to subsist because of their energetically efficient ligament-muscle system for opening and closing valves. All this has been broadly disproven, though; rather, the prominence of modern <b>bivalves</b> over brachiopods seems due to chance disparities in their response to extinction events.|$|E
5|$|The {{rates of}} {{metabolism}} of Brachiopoda are between one third and one tenth {{of those of}} <b>bivalves.</b> While brachiopods were abundant in warm, shallow seas during the Cretaceous period, they have been outcompeted by <b>bivalves,</b> and now live mainly in cold and low-light conditions.|$|E

5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{habits of}} the <b>bivalves</b> have meant that in general the nervous system is less complex than in most other molluscs. The animals have no brain; the nervous system consists of a nerve network {{and a series of}} paired ganglia. In all but the most primitive <b>bivalves,</b> two cerebropleural ganglia are {{on either side of the}} oesophagus. The cerebral ganglia control the sensory organs, while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity. The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral ganglia, which can be quite large in swimming <b>bivalves,</b> are under the posterior adductor muscle. These ganglia are both connected to the cerebropleural ganglia by nerve fibres. <b>Bivalves</b> with long siphons may also have siphonal ganglia to control them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bivalves</b> {{appear in}} the fossil record first in the early Cambrian more than 500 million years ago. The total number of living species is about 9,200. These species are placed within 1,260 genera and 106 families. Marine <b>bivalves</b> (including {{brackish}} water and estuarine species) represent about 8,000 species, combined in four subclasses and 99 families with 1,100 genera. The largest recent marine families are the Veneridae, with more than 680 species and the Tellinidae and Lucinidae, each with over 500 species. The freshwater <b>bivalves</b> include seven families, the largest of which are the Unionidae, with about 700 species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bivalves</b> {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} that bathes the organs in hemolymph. The heart has three chambers: two {{auricles}} receiving blood from the gills, and a single ventricle. The ventricle is muscular and pumps hemolymph into the aorta, {{and then to the}} rest of the body. Some <b>bivalves</b> have a single aorta, but most also have a second, usually smaller, aorta serving the hind parts of the animal.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the Paleozoic, around 400 Mya, the brachiopods were among the most {{abundant}} filter feeders in the ocean, and over 12,000 fossil species are recognized. By the PermianTriassic extinction event 250 Mya, <b>bivalves</b> were undergoing a huge radiation of diversity. The <b>bivalves</b> were hard hit by this event, but re-established themselves and thrived during the Triassic period that followed. In contrast, the brachiopods lost 95% of their species diversity. The ability of some <b>bivalves</b> to burrow and thus avoid predators may have been a major factor in their success. Other new adaptations within various families allowed species to occupy previously unused evolutionary niches. These included increasing relative buoyancy in soft sediments by developing spines on the shell, gaining the ability to swim, and in a few cases, adopting predatory habits.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>bivalves</b> have no eyes, but a {{few members}} of the Arcoidea, Limopsoidea, Mytiloidea, Anomioidea, Ostreoidea, and Limoidea have simple eyes on the margin of the mantle. These consist of a pit of photosensory cells and a lens. Scallops have more complex eyes with a lens, a two-layered retina, and a concave mirror. All <b>bivalves</b> have {{light-sensitive}} cells that can detect a shadow falling over the animal.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>bivalves</b> are filter feeders, {{using their}} gills to capture {{particulate}} food such as phytoplankton from the water. The protobranchs feed {{in a different}} way, scraping detritus from the seabed, {{and this may be}} the original mode of feeding used by all <b>bivalves</b> before the gills became adapted for filter feeding. These primitive <b>bivalves</b> hold on to the substratum with a pair of tentacles {{at the edge of the}} mouth, each of which has a single palp, or flap. The tentacles are covered in mucus, which traps the food, and cilia, which transport the particles back to the palps. These then sort the particles, rejecting those that are unsuitable or too large to digest, and conveying others to the mouth.|$|E
40|$|Diverse species assemblages {{are often}} {{associated}} with a diversity of habitat structures. Sedimentary systems seem to be no exception, as within sedimentary systems benthic species diversity within a sample point appears to correlate with sediment grain size complexity. However, {{it remains to be}} shown whether total benthic species diversity relates to a system’s sediment heterogeneity across multiple systems. In the present paper we examined whether <b>bivalve</b> diversity is associated with: (1) sediment heterogeneity across systems and (2) sediment grain size complexity within systems, at 9 temperate and tropical tidal flat systems. Although <b>bivalve</b> life-history strategies, like post-settlement habitat selection, might suggest that sediment heterogeneity should be important for <b>bivalve</b> species, <b>bivalve</b> diversity and sediment heterogeneity were not associated across systems. Interestingly, the association between total benthic diversity and sediment heterogeneity was also not significant, suggesting that changing species composition across systems does not account for the lack of a correlation between <b>bivalve</b> diversity and sediment heterogeneity. Instead of habitat differentiation, <b>bivalve</b> diversity within a sample point was highest in ‘complex’ fine-grained sediments and <b>bivalve</b> distributions showed a large degree of distributional overlap in all systems. The results of this study at both smaller and larger spatial scales suggest that coexistence between <b>bivalve</b> species in diverse tidal flats is not associated with increased sediment heterogeneity. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Brachiopods are marine Lophotrochozoa whose soft {{parts are}} {{enclosed}} in a <b>bivalved</b> shell. Although brachiopods {{are represented by}} a rich record from the Early Cambrian to the present, the origin of their <b>bivalved</b> body plan remains controversial. The Early Cambrian organophosphatic tommotiids Micrina and Paterimitra from Australia have been proposed as stem brachiopods. Here, we describe their earliest ontogeny, indicating that tommotiids possessed <b>bivalved</b> planktotrophic larvae. The curious combinations of characters in Micrina and Paterimitra indicate that they may belong to the stems of the Linguliformea and Rhynchonelliformea, respectively. The <b>bivalved</b> shell of adult living brachiopods may represent a plesiomorphic character retained from planktic tommotiid larvae; the crown group body plan of the Brachiopoda may have evolved through the paedomorphic retention of a <b>bivalved</b> larval state. 5 page(s...|$|R
5|$|Some <b>bivalves,</b> {{including}} the true oysters, the jewel boxes, the jingle shells, the thorny oysters and the kitten's paws, cement themselves to stones, rock or larger dead shells. In oysters the lower valve may be almost flat while the upper valve develops {{layer upon layer}} of thin horny material reinforced with calcium carbonate. Oysters sometimes occur in dense beds in the neritic zone and, like most <b>bivalves,</b> are filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|A few <b>bivalves,</b> {{such as the}} {{granular}} poromya (Poromya granulata), are carnivorous, eating {{much larger}} prey than the tiny microalgae consumed by other <b>bivalves.</b> In these animals, the gills are relatively small, and form a perforated barrier separating the main mantle cavity from a smaller chamber through which the water is exhaled. Muscles draw water in through the inhalant siphon which is modified into a cowl-shaped organ, sucking in small crustaceans and worms at the same time. The siphon can be retracted quickly and inverted, bringing the prey within reach of the mouth. The gut is modified so that large food particles can be digested.|$|E
5|$|As {{the head}} has largely {{disappeared}} in <b>bivalves,</b> the mouth has been equipped with labial palps (two {{on each side}} of the mouth) to collect the detritus from its mucus.|$|E
50|$|A hinge {{ligament}} is {{a crucial}} part of the anatomical structure of a <b>bivalve</b> shell, i.e. the shell of a <b>bivalve</b> mollusk. The shell of a <b>bivalve</b> has two valves and these are joined together by the ligament at the dorsal edge of the shell. The ligament is made of a strong, flexible and elastic, fibrous, proteinaceous material which is usually pale brown, dark brown or black in color.|$|R

5|$|Filter feeders are {{molluscs}} {{that feed}} by straining suspended matter and food particle from water, typically by passing the water over their gills. Most <b>bivalves</b> are filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|In the Filibranchia and Eulamellibranchia, {{water is}} {{drawn into the}} shell from the {{posterior}} ventral surface of the animal, passes upwards through the gills, and doubles back to be expelled just above the intake. In burrowing species, there may be two elongated, retractable siphons reaching up to the seabed, one each for the inhalant and exhalant streams of water. The gills of filter-feeding <b>bivalves</b> are known as ctenidia and have become highly modified to increase their ability to capture food. For example, the cilia on the gills, which originally served to remove unwanted sediment, have become adapted to capture food particles, and transport them in {{a steady stream of}} mucus to the mouth. The filaments of the gills are also much longer than those in more primitive <b>bivalves,</b> and are folded over to create a groove through which food can be transported. The structure of the gills varies considerably, and can serve as a useful means for classifying <b>bivalves</b> into groups.|$|E
