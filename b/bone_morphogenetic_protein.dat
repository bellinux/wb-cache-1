5|$|The {{respiratory}} tract has a branching structure {{like that of}} a tree. In the embryo this structure is developed in the process of branching morphogenesis, and is generated by the repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. In the development of the lungs (as in some other organs) the epithelium forms branching tubes.The lung has a left-right symmetry and each bud known as a bronchial bud grows out as a tubular epithelium that becomes a bronchus. Each bronchus branches into bronchioles. The branching {{is a result of the}} tip of each tube bifurcating. The branching process forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately the alveoli. The four genes mostly associated with branching morphogenesis in the lung are the intercellular signalling protein – sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and <b>bone</b> <b>morphogenetic</b> <b>protein</b> BMP4. FGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. FGF10 is a paracrine signalling molecule needed for epithelial branching, and SHH inhibits FGF10. The development of the alveoli is influenced by a different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the alveoli.|$|E
5|$|All genes known {{so far to}} {{be linked}} to HHT code for {{proteins}} in the TGF-β signaling pathway. This is a group of proteins that participates in signal transduction of hormones of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily (the transforming growth factor beta, <b>bone</b> <b>morphogenetic</b> <b>protein</b> and growth differentiation factor classes), specifically BMP9/GDF2 and BMP10. The hormones do not enter the cell but link to receptors on the cell membrane; these then activate other proteins, eventually influencing cellular behavior {{in a number of ways}} such as cellular survival, proliferation (increasing in number) and differentiation (becoming more specialized). For the hormone signal to be adequately transduced, a combination of proteins is needed: two each of two types of serine/threonine-specific kinase type membrane receptors and endoglin. When bound to the hormone, the type II receptor proteins phosphorylate (transfer phosphate) onto type I receptor proteins (of which Alk-1 is one), which in turn phosphorylate a complex of SMAD proteins (chiefly SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8). These bind to SMAD4 and migrate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the transcription of particular genes. In addition to the SMAD pathway, the membrane receptors also act on the MAPK pathway, which has additional actions on the behavior of cells. Both Alk-1 and endoglin are expressed predominantly in endothelium, perhaps explaining why HHT-causing mutations in these proteins lead predominantly to blood vessel problems. Both ENG and ACVRL1 mutations lead predominantly to underproduction of the related proteins, rather than misfunctioning of the proteins.|$|E

25|$|A recent study, done in November 2010 and {{published}} March 2011, {{was done by}} a team of scientists from the University of Rochester and University of Colorado School of Medicine. They did an experiment to attempt to repair trauma to the Central Nervous System of an adult rat by replacing the glial cells. When the glial cells were injected into the injury of the adult rat’s spinal cord, astrocytes were generated by exposing human glial precursor cells to <b>bone</b> <b>morphogenetic</b> <b>protein</b> (<b>Bone</b> <b>morphogenetic</b> <b>protein</b> is important because it is considered to create tissue architecture throughout the body). So, with the bone protein and human glial cells combined, they promoted significant recovery of conscious foot placement, axonal growth, and obvious increases in neuronal survival in the spinal cord laminae. On the other hand, human glial precursor cells and astrocytes generated from these cells by being in contact with ciliary neurotrophic factors, failed to promote neuronal survival and support of axonal growth at the spot of the injury.|$|E
25|$|The BMPs bind to the <b>bone</b> <b>morphogenetic</b> <b>protein</b> {{receptor}} type II (BMPR2). Some of {{the proteins}} of the BMP family are BMP4 and BMP7. BMP4 promotes bone formation, causes cell death, or signals {{the formation of}} epidermis, depending on the tissue it is acting on. BMP7 is crucial for kidney development, sperm synthesis, and neural tube polarization. Both BMP4 and BMP7 regulate mature ligand stability and processing, including degrading ligands in lysosomes. BMPs act by diffusing from the cells that create them.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Bone</b> <b>morphogenetic</b> <b>protein</b> 4, or BMP4, is a {{transforming}} {{growth factor}} {{that causes the}} cells of the ectoderm to differentiate into skin cells. Without BMP4 the ectoderm cells would develop into neural cells. [...] Axial mesoderm cells under the ectoderm secrete inhibitory signals called chordin, noggin and follistatin. [...] These inhibitory signals prevent the action of BMP4, which would normally make the cells ectoderm; as a result, the overlying cells take their normal course and develop into neural cells. [...] The cells in the ectoderm that circumscribe these neural cells do not receive the BMP4 inhibitor signals and as a result BMP4 induces these cells to develop into skin cells.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{a set of}} famous {{experiments}} by Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold showed that the formation of nervous tissue is [...] "induced" [...] by signals {{from a group of}} mesodermal cells called the organizer region. For decades, though, the nature of the induction process defeated every attempt to figure it out, until finally it was resolved by genetic approaches in the 1990s. [...] Induction of neural tissue requires inhibition of the gene for a so-called <b>bone</b> <b>morphogenetic</b> <b>protein,</b> or BMP. [...] Specifically the protein BMP4 appears to be involved. [...] Two proteins called Noggin and Chordin, both secreted by the mesoderm, are capable of inhibiting BMP4 and thereby inducing ectoderm to turn into neural tissue. [...] It appears that a similar molecular mechanism is involved for widely disparate types of animals, including arthropods as well as vertebrates. [...] In some animals, however, another type of molecule called Fibroblast Growth Factor or FGF may also {{play an important role in}} induction.|$|E
