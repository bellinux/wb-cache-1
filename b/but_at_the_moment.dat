25|$|On 18 April Lefebvre, Morlot and Hatry made {{a frontal}} {{assault on the}} Austrian redoubts, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> they had formed up for a bayonet charge, the {{division}} under Championnet, which had turned the enemy left in taking the heights of Toernich, threw the Austrian ranks into such disorder that they fled {{on the road to}} Luxembourg. Many were killed by the light artillery under general Debelle, whose batteries had followed Championnet's movement. On this occasion Championnet was made chef de brigade (colonel). The left of the Army of the Moselle set up base in Arlon, but Beaulieu returned in force on 29 April and surprised Hatry and Championnet who, at their turn, had to retreat in disorder to Aubange and Longwy.|$|E
25|$|That night, Karl and Harry have a {{confrontation}} backstage, in which Karl accuses Harry of murdering Carol; Harry angrily rejects the accusation and challenges that Karl merely finds {{it easier to}} believe that rather than accept the guilt of betraying his best friend. On stage, Karl begins to pioneer his psychic act, but the stooge he has hired in the crowd which he had chosen with a fake random ball toss, accidentally trips and concusses himself on the stage. Upon hearing the sad story of another selected audience member, he decides that he cannot perpetuate the fraud, admitting to the audience {{that he is not}} able to contact the dead. As a result, Dani forgives him. Harry, as 'The Black Widower', starts his guillotine act, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> of truth Linda's nerve fails her and she flees the stage. Although Harry’s act would appear to be ruined when he asks if anybody else wants to try, Karl steps forward and announces that he will face the guillotine instead. Karl allows himself to be locked in the guillotine, explaining that Carol was frequently unfaithful and forced Karl to have sex with her. Harry appears to decapitate Karl – although it is merely an illusion, and Karl appears unharmed, the trick having worked perfectly. Harry wins the competition, and in his acceptance speech both forgives Karl and admits that he loves Linda, who joins him on stage and the two kiss. Their friendship mended, Karl and Harry embark on a reunion tour, incorporating Dani and Linda into the act as their assistants.|$|E

Heckman went on to compare Harrison's philanthropy with the activities of two of his former bandmates, saying: [...] "I have no quarrel with John Lennon's endless clattering around inside his psyche, or Paul McCartney's search for sweetness and light, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> I have to have stronger feelings about George Harrison's active efforts {{to do something about the}} misery in the world around him. How surprising that the most introspective of the Beatles should be the one who, in the long run, takes the most effective actions." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{characterized}} the initial release of Windows 10 in July 2015 as being rushed, citing the incomplete state {{of some of}} the operating system's bundled software (such as the Edge web browser), as well as the stability of the operating system itself on launch. However, TechRadar felt that Windows10 would be [...] "the new Windows7", citing the operating system's more familiar user interface, improvements to bundled apps, performance improvements, a [...] "rock solid" [...] search system, and the Settings app being more full-featured than its equivalents on8 and8.1. The Microsoft Edge web browser was praised for its performance, albeit not being in a feature-complete state on-launch. While considering them a [...] "great idea in principle", concerns were shown for Microsoft's focus on the universal app ecosystem, noting that [...] "It's by no means certain that developers are going to flock to Windows10 from iOS and Android simply because they can convert their apps easily. It may well become a no-brainer for them, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> a conscious decision is still required." ...|$|E

[...] Lewis returns the money he took from Peter, adding an extra {{thousand}} pounds as compensation. Havers said that Lewis feels desperately bad about what he did. Upon entering the Rovers, Lewis is punched by Deirdre. [...] Havers stated that Lewis wants Audrey to forgive him and [...] give him a second chance. Lewis finds Audrey charming and honest and he likes being mothered by her to an extent. Havers said that Lewis did fall in love with Audrey while they were together, but no one believes him as he has told so many lies, and thought Lewis' one redeeming feature was not taking Audrey's money when he had the chance. Havers added, [...] "He's been feeling terrible because he did the dirty on her and he wants to make amends." ...|$|E
500|$|Mirella D’Ancona {{argues that}} the image {{reflects}} Michelangelo’s views on {{the roles of the}} members of the Holy Family in human salvation and the soul’s immortality. The Virgin’s placement and emphasis is due to her role in human salvation. She is both the mother of Christ and the best intercessor for appealing to him. Michelangelo, who had been strongly influenced by the Dominican Fra Girolamo Savonarola in Florence, is using the picture to defend the Maculist point of view, a philosophy of the Dominican order rejecting the idea of the Immaculate Conception of Mary. The Maculist view is that the Virgin did not receive her sanctification at birth <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> of the incarnation of Christ; thus, the image depicts the moment of Mary’s sanctification by showing the Christ Child blessing her. Michelangelo depicts Christ as if he is growing out of Mary’s shoulder to take human form, one leg hanging limply and the other not visible at all, therefore making him a part of Mary. Moreover, his muscles and balance convey an upward movement, as if he is growing out of her, although he is above Mary, asserting his superiority to her. [...] Furthermore, she {{argues that the}} nudes are to be interpreted as sinners who have removed their clothes for cleansing and purification through baptism. The water, which separates the sinners from the Holy Family, just beyond the horizontal band in the middle of the painting, can therefore be seen as the “waters of separation” mentioned in the Bible. [...] She also argues that the five figures may represent the five parts of the soul: the higher soul (soul and intellect) on the left and the lower soul (imagination, sensation, and nourishing faculty) on the right, a visual depiction of the views of Marsilio Ficino, whom Michelangelo references in other works. [...] Additionally, in looking at them as separate groupings, she suggest that the two figures on Mary’s right represents the human and divine natures of Christ, while the three on her left represent the Trinity.|$|E

2500|$|Trade routes {{along the}} Middle Passage {{were one of}} the main cogs in {{establishing}} what is known as capitalism today. [...] For pirates in the Atlantic World, trade routes are fortuitous, because of the vast wealth they supply in the way of cargo that moved along the Middle Passage. From 1715 to 1728, pirate activity created problems for merchant ships along the trade routes, thus halting growth during that period. As piracy along the Middle Passage increased, so did the need for owners of the merchant vessels to insure the cargo on board their ships, because not only was there threat of loss from natural disaster, there was the chance the cargo could be lost to plundering pirates. [...] "The genius of insurance," [...] in the way it contributes to finance capitalism, is the insistence that the real test of something's value comes not at the moment it is made or exchanged, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> it is lost or destroyed.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Diarmaid Ferriter said: [...] "There'll be broad {{consensus}} {{around what}} Bertie did in Northern Ireland, the social partnership and the unity {{he brought to}} his own party.

But I wonder will people talk about 'Ahernism'? Is there any such thing? What does he actually stand for? In some ways Bertie's lack of vision was a positive, it made him flexible and willing to compromise, and he was certainly outstanding in that regard. But I dissent from the universal plaudits going around at the moment. He had no social or economic vision for the state he led. There was no fire in his belly. He didn't really want to change society for the better. He was the ward boss writ large. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> it seems it's unfashionable to say anything adverse about Bertie." ...|$|E

After the event's conclusion police officers were deployed and the IWA retained physical possession of the championship. Following this the belt was returned to WWC personnel following an ultimatum, which claimed that the company would take legal action if it wasn't returned within forty-eight hours. However, both the International Wrestling Association and the National Wrestling Alliance recognized the unification match, and considered Lozada the first Undisputed World Heavyweight Champion in Puerto Rico.|$|E

He scored {{twice on}} his debut in Crawley's {{first game of}} the 2007–08 season, a 2–1 home win against Stevenage. The following week, Madjo scored again, this time in a 4–1 away loss at Salisbury City. In September 2007, Madjo scored in five consecutive fixtures, including a brace in a 5–3 home win against Woking. He also scored twice within the space of a week in October 2007, scoring in away fixtures against Kidderminster Harriers and Weymouth respectively.
