25|$|Conservation means {{development}} {{as much as}} it does protection. I recognize the right and duty of this generation to develop and use the natural resources of our land <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not recognize the right to waste them, or to rob, by wasteful use, the generations that come after us.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} history is finished. The endeavour is complete. If you'd asked me 20 years ago whether we'd be attempting such a mammoth task, I'd have said 'Don't be ridiculous'. These programmes tell a particular story and I'm sure others will {{come along and}} tell it much better than I did, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> hope that if people watch it in 50 years' time, it will still {{have something to say}} about the world we live in.|$|E

25|$|The {{politics}} {{of this would be}} very easy. The politics would be, {{to be one of the}} lads, the safest way in Ireland. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe that the interests of this State, or our Constitution and of this Republic, would be served by putting politics before conscience in regard to this. There is a choice of a kind that can only be answered by saying that I stand by the Republic and accordingly I will not oppose this Bill.|$|E
25|$|I {{actually}} {{never met}} the Three Kings—it didn't matter how hard my little brother and I tried to keep awake at night {{to catch a glimpse}} of the Three Royal Visitors, we would always fall asleep just before they arrived. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> remember hearing them. I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and I remember the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|E
25|$|From {{beyond the}} boundary, it is {{difficult}} to gauge Snow's pace as Lindsay Hassett conceded. He appears to bowl his bumper appreciably faster than most of his fuller-length deliveries, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe even his faster bumper knocks {{at the door of the}} pace of bowlers I have named. His top pace, I consider, lies somewhere between that of Statham and Trueman...Snow's loping, almost lazy run, of course, is sinisterly deceptive. It is in that last stride, or last two strides, when that long, straight powerful arm gathers its impetus and either whips or coasts through, that the potential is born.|$|E

25|$|Much of what I {{did with}} my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a {{different}} body—there's {{not as much}} of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E
25|$|I {{have come}} to the clear {{conclusion}} that there is no basis upon which there should be a further Judicial Inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's Inquiry. There is no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988. I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken. Nor do I consider that there is any justification for setting up any further inquiry into the performance of the emergency and hospital services. I have considered the circumstances in which alterations were made to some of the self-written statements of South Yorkshire Police officers, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not consider that there is any occasion for any further investigation.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E

500|$|This {{episode is}} one of Yeardley Smith's {{favorite}} episodes.

500|$|Craig {{has been}} {{reluctant}} to discuss his religious beliefs. During an interview about the apparently anti-religious message of the 2007 film, The Golden Compass, in which Craig starred, he stated: [...] "I've never been religious and I’m not a church-goer, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> find religion fascinating because it has such a huge impact on our lives".|$|E

500|$|At a 50th anniversary {{symposium}} of the Pearl Harbor attack, Taylor {{met with}} a Japanese pilot {{who was part of}} the first wave of bombers to attack Pearl Harbor. The pilot reflected on Taylor's efforts, [...] "I was impressed by Mr. Taylor's grit to storm into the pack of Japanese fighters", and Taylor also told a reporter [...] "I have no hatred against Japanese people, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> against those who started the war." ...|$|E

500|$|The type {{of letters}} written with {{a tone of}} incensed moral outrage have become {{commonly}} described as [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] letters, even though the writer may not be from Royal Tunbridge Wells. For example, actor Michael Caine once said: [...] "I don't want to sound like Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{think there should be}} some sort of national service for young men". People writing them have been claimed by commentators to be readers of the Daily Mail, despite the original letters not originating in that publication.|$|E
