40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Metabolism is {{essential}} to understand human health. To characterize human metabolism, a high-resolution read-out of the metabolic status under various physiological conditions, either in health or disease, is needed. Metabolomics offers an unprecedented approach for generating system-specific <b>biochemical</b> <b>definitions</b> of a human phenotype through the capture {{of a variety of}} metabolites in a single measurement. The emergence of large cohorts in clinical studies increases the demand of technologies able to analyze a large number of measurements, in an automated fashion, in the most robust way. NMR is an established metabolomics tool for obtaining metabolic phenotypes. Here, we describe the analysis of NMR-based urinary profiles for metabolic studies, challenged to a large human study (3007 samples). This method includes the acquisition of nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy one-dimensional and J-resolved two-dimensional (J-Res- 2 D) 1 H NMR spectra obtained on a 600 MHz spectrometer, equipped with a 120 μL flow probe, coupled to a flow-injection analysi...|$|R
40|$|The plasma {{membrane}} {{has long been}} conceived as a homogenous lipid bilayer sheet {{that serves as a}} passive viscous matrix for membrane proteins. The hypothesis of lipid rafts has added more complexity in the lateral organization of the {{plasma membrane}}. Lipid rafts were originally defined as micrometer-sized lipid domains enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol within cellular membranes that assemble specific sets of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored and transmembrane proteins. These domains form platforms for membrane sorting in targeted-membrane trafficking and cell signaling processes. Experimentally, lipid rafts are partially resistant to non-ionic detergent solubilization in the cold and functionally dependent of the cholesterol level in the membrane. The extensive use of these simplistic <b>biochemical</b> <b>definitions</b> has accumulated a large body of inconsistent data that obscure the very concept of lateral membrane organization. More recent studies using less perturbing techniques in living cells have reshaped our understanding in the structure, function and dynamics of the plasma membrane. This current understanding became the essential principles of lateral membrane organization models that add new aspects previously uncovered by the original hypothesis of lipid rafts...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial {{identified}} {{an inverse}} relationship between HbA 1 c and severe hypoglycemia. We investigated the relationship between hypoglycemia and HbA 1 c in a large type 1 diabetes cohort on multiple daily injection or insulin pump therapy using blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. The impact of real-time CGM on these relationships and how these relationships differ with <b>biochemical</b> <b>definitions</b> of hypoglycemia have also been assessed. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: CGM data {{were obtained from the}} JDRF CGM randomized control trial. Baseline blinded-CGM data were used to assess time in hypoglycemia in all individuals. End-point data from the CGM intervention group were used {{to assess the impact of}} CGM. Percentage times < 3. 9, 3. 3, 3. 0, and 2. 8 mmol/L were calculated and quadratic regression plots drawn. Relationships were analyzed visually, and ANOVA was used to assess relationships between glycemia and time below threshold. RESULTS: J-shaped relationships were observed for all biochemical hypoglycemia thresholds, with the lowest hypoglycemia risk occurring at HbA 1 c values between 8. 1 and 8. 6 % (65 - 70 mmol/mol). The use of an average of 5 days/week of CGM flattened the relationships for 3. 3, 3. 0, and 2. 8 mmol/L, and ANOVA confirmed the loss of relationship for the 3. 3 mmol/L threshold using CGM. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between hypoglycemia and HbA 1 c in a population with type 1 diabetes is J-shaped. Lower HbA 1 c values are still associated with increased hypoglycemia risk, although the magnitude of risk depends on biochemical threshold. Real-time CGM may reduce the percentage time spent in hypoglycemia, changing the relationship between HbA 1 c and hypoglycemia...|$|R
40|$|Context: Population-based {{screening}} {{has been}} advocated for subclinical thyroid dysfunction {{in the elderly}} because the disorder {{is perceived to be}} common, and health benefits may be accrued by detection and treatment. Objective: The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the prevalence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction and unidentified overt thyroid dysfunction in an elderly population. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional survey of a community sample of participants aged 65 yr and older registered with 20 family practices in the United Kingdom. Exclusions: Exclusions included current therapy for thyroid disease, thyroid surgery, or treatment within 12 months. Outcome Measure: Tests of thyroid function (TSH concentration and free T 4 concentration in all, with measurement of free T 3 in those with low TSH) were conducted. Explanatory Variables: These included all current medical diagnoses and drug therapies, age, gender, and socioeconomic deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation, 2004) Analysis: Standardized prevalence rates were analyzed. Logistic regression modeling was used to determine factors associated with the presence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction Results: A total of 5960 attended for screening. Using <b>biochemical</b> <b>definitions,</b> 94. 2 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 93. 8 - 94. 6 %] were euthyroid. Unidentified overt hyper- and hypothyroidism were uncommon (0. 3, 0. 4 %, respectively). Subclinical hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism were identified with similar frequency (2. 1 %, 95 % CI 1. 8 - 2. 3 %; 2. 9 %, 95 % CI 2. 6 - 3. 1 %, respectively). Subclinical thyroid dysfunction was more common in females (P < 0. 001) and with increasing age (P < 0. 001). After allowing for comorbidities, concurrent drug therapies, age, and gender, an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and a composite measure of socioeconomic deprivation remained. Conclusions: Undiagnosed overt thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The prevalence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is 5 %. We have, for the first time, identified an independent association between the prevalence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction and deprivation that cannot be explained solely by the greater burden of chronic disease and/or consequent drug therapies in the deprived population.

40|$|Acute myelogenous leukemias (AMLs) are {{characterized}} by medullary and extramedullary invasion. We hypothesized that a supramolecular complex, the leukemia-cell invadosome, which contains certain integrins, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and other as-yet unidentified proteins, is essential for tissue invasion and may be central to the phenotypic diversity observed in the clinic. Here we show that the specific binding of MMP- 9 to leukocyte surface β 2 integrin is required for pericellular proteolysis and migration of AML-derived cells. An efficient antileukemia effect was obtained by the hexapeptide HFDDDE, a motif of the MMP- 9 catalytic domain that mediates integrin binding: HFDDDE prevented proMMP- 9 binding, transmigration through a human endothelial cell layer, and extracellular matrix degradation. Notably, the functional protein anchorage between β 2 integrin and proMMP- 9 described in this study does not involve the enzymatic active sites targeted by known MMP inhibitors. Taken together, our results provide a <b>biochemical</b> working <b>definition</b> for the human leukemia invadosome.

All these are elements of an exemplar case of misannotation in biological databases and confusion in the scientific literature concerning genes and enzymes acting on ureidoglycolate, an intermediate of purine catabolism. Here we show biochemical evidence for the relocation of genes assigned to EC 3. 5. 3. 19 (ureidoglycolate hydrolase, releasing ammonia), such as allA of Escherichia coli or DAL 3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to EC 4. 3. 2. 3 (ureidoglycolate lyase, releasing urea). The EC 3. 5. 3. 19 should be more appropriately named ureidoglycolate amidohydrolase and include genes equivalent to UAH of Arabidopsis thaliana. The distinction between ammonia- or urea-releasing activities from ureidoglycolate is relevant for the understanding of nitrogen metabolism in various organisms and of virulence factors in certain pathogens rather than a nomenclature problem. We trace the original fault in database annotation and provide a rationale for its incorporation and persistence in the scientific literature.

Materials and Methods: 162 patients were followed between November 2004 and December 2010. Two different dose escalation groups were done: group 1 (n= 92), 1 fraction HDR boost (9 - 10 Gy) followed by EBRT (60 Gy in 6 weeks) - BED: 203 - 216 Gy and group 2 (n= 70) : 2 fraction HDR boost (18 - 19 Gy), 6 hours interval between fractions, followed by EBRT (46 Gy in 4. 5 weeks) - BED: 233. 3 - 247 Gy; 116 pts (71. 6 %) received concomitant androgen deprivation. Patients were classified according to the MSKCC criteria into high (N= 137) and intermediate (N= 25) risk. Phoenix <b>biochemical</b> failure <b>definition</b> was used. Toxicity was scored by Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (RTOG) Results: The mean follow-up was 41 (range 7 - 84) months. The 7 - years cancer-specific and overall survival was 100 % an 92 %, respectively. The 7 years actuarial biochemical control rate was 89 % and 100 % for group 1 and 2, respectively. One patient from group 1 and two patients from group 2 never reached a low nadir. Two patients developed distant metastases 12 and 16 months after the treatment. In a multivariate Cox-regression analysis neither treatment nor risk group (intermediate vs. high risk) were associated with increased risk for biochemical failure. The RTOG grade 3 genitourinary early toxicity was 1. 0 % and 8. 5 % while gastrointestinal/genitourinary late toxicity was 7. 6 % and 1. 4 % for group 1 and 2, respectively Conclusions: HDR BT boost followed by EBRT appears to be a safe, feasible and effective treatment for patients with unfavorable localized prostate cancer.

Different brain areas from 41 sCJD and 12 iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) cases were investigated, using Western blotting for PrP(res) and two other biochemical assays reflecting the behaviour of the disease-associated form of the prion protein (PrP(Sc)) under variable PK digestion conditions. In 30 % of cases, both type 1 and type 2 PrP(res) were identified. Despite this, the other two biochemical assays found that PrP(Sc) from an individual patient demonstrated uniform biochemical properties. Moreover, in sCJD, four distinct biochemical PrP(Sc) subgroups were identified that correlated with the current sCJD clinico-pathological classification. In iCJD, four similar biochemical clusters were observed, but these did not correlate to any particular PRNP 129 polymorphism or western blot PrP(res) pattern.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the effect of alcohol consumption on the pathogenesis of bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract via nutritional pathways. Altered nutritional status is a frequently recognised clinical accompaniement of heavy alcohol consumption in hospitalized patients. Similarly, upper gastrointestinal bleeding is frequently accompanied by the presence of heavy alcohol consumption. Nevertheless, the clinical quantification of alcohol intake is often descriptive, so that a link between alcohol use and upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage via nutritional mechanisms has been only generally defined. In the literature review, the methods of defining alcohol use and abuse, using interview, biochemical and haematological techniques are noted. The relationship between alcohol abuse and nutrient imbalances is reviewed, especially in relation to possible effects on the gastrointestinal tract, appetite and eating habits. A further section reviews the relationship between alcohol use and anatomical lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract likely to lead to bleeding. Following the chapter in which the methods used in this thesis are described. Chapter 4 seeks to describe the study population and its subgroups in this thesis in relation to interview, biochemical and haematological methods. Alcohol use is defined in relation to (1) a clinical classification of heavy or light drinking, based on a questionnaire administered in Casualty, (2) a quantified method of determining alcohol consumption during a subsequent ward dietetic assessment, (3) in relation to a <b>biochemical</b> <b>definition</b> (recent drinking and non-drinking), and a classification of (1) and (2) called, {{for the purposes of this}} thesis, 2 ̆ 7 alcohol abusers 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 nonabusers 2 ̆ 7. Heavy, regular and recent drinkers and alcohol abusers tend to be male and younger than light, infrequent and nonrecent drinkers and nonabusers. Chapter 5 relates the nutritional status of those patients admitted acutely to hospital in relation to the groups defined in Chapter 4, Nutritional status is defined in terms of food intake, anthropometry, biochemical and haematological parameters. Different methods of defining alcohol use give rise to different patterns of nutritional impairment. Chapter 6 relates the nutritional status of those patients admitted acutely to hospital in relation to the presence or absence of an endoscopically defined site of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. A difference is seen between those bleeding from a Mailory-weiss tear and other sites of bleeding, similarly, biochemical differences in nutritional status emerge between those patients who presented in shock, and those who did not. Chapter 7 explores the relationships between biochemical markers of nutritional status and haemostatic variables in the groups of abusers/non-abusers, the various sites of primary bleeding/controls, and shock/non-shock.

40|$|AbstractThe {{absence of}} {{comprehensive}} measured kinetic {{values and the}} observed inconsistency in the available in vitro kinetic data has hindered the formulation of network-scale kinetic models of biochemical reaction networks. To meet this challenge we present an approach to construct a convex space, termed the k-cone, which contains all the allowable numerical values of the kinetic constants in large-scale <b>biochemical</b> networks. The <b>definition</b> of the k-cone relies on the incorporation of in vivo concentration data and a simplified approach to represent enzyme kinetics within an established constraint-based modeling approach. The k-cone approach was implemented to define the allowable combination of numerical values for a full kinetic model of human red blood cell metabolism and to study its correlated kinetic parameters. The k-cone approach {{can be used to}} determine consistency between in vitro measured kinetic values and in vivo concentration and flux measurements when used in a network-scale kinetic model. k-Cone analysis was successful in determining whether in vitro measured kinetic values used in the reconstruction of a kinetic-based model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae central metabolism could reproduce in vivo measurements. Further, the k-cone can be used to determine which numerical values of in vitro measured parameters are required to be changed in a kinetic model if in vivo measured values are not reproduced. k-Cone analysis could identify what minimum number of in vitro determined kinetic parameters needed to be adjusted in the S. cerevisiae model to be consistent with the in vivo data. Applying the k-cone analysis a priori to kinetic model development may reduce the time and effort involved in model building and parameter adjustment. With the recent developments in high-throughput profiling of metabolite concentrations at a whole-cell scale and advances in metabolomics technologies, the k-cone approach presented here may hold the promise for kinetic characterization of metabolic networks as well as other biological functions at a whole-cell level...|$|R
