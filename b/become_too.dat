Talmud Torah Anshei Emes's membership was mostly made up of Eastern European Jews, who were stricter in their observances than Baith Israel's mostly German-origin membership; to accommodate them, a special all-men section of pews was designated at the front left of the sanctuary.|$|E

5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol <b>become</b> <b>too</b> inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Being a free city, Sélestat {{attracted}} settlers {{from the}} region who sought protection, freedom and a thriving economic environment. The first city wall, which had <b>become</b> <b>too</b> constricting, was replaced in 1280, and a third wall had to be erected in the 16th century as the city grew. At {{the end of the}} Middle Ages, the population was estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000. It was then the fourth largest Alsatian town after Strasbourg (18,000), Colmar and Haguenau (6,000 each). The local economy reached its zenith around 1500. It was centered on shipping and trade (mainly hay, cereals, wine, fish, glass, iron and salt). As the road network was poor and dangerous, goods transited via the Ill river.|$|E

The attendance record, variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341, was set at a 1939 FA Cup tie against Everton. During the Second World War, St Andrew's suffered bomb damage and the grandstand, housing a temporary fire station, burned down in an accidental fire. In the 1950s, the club replaced the stand and installed floodlights, and later erected a second small stand and roofed over the open terraces, but there were few further changes.|$|E
5|$|Following the June 29, 1889 elections, several {{suburban}} townships {{voted to}} be annexed to the city, which offered better services, such as improved water supply, sewerage, and fire and police protection. Hyde Park Township, however, had installed new waterworks in 1883 {{just north of}} 87th Street. Nonetheless, the majority of voters in 1889 supported annexation {{perhaps because of the}} city’s water system for fire prevention or because of the belief that township government had <b>become</b> <b>too</b> unwieldy. After the 1889 annexation Chicago was able to leverage efficiencies as the largest United States city in area and second largest in population.|$|E

Following the major success of The College Dropout, the album reveals his {{progression}} in writing lyrics and an incorporation of {{a wider range of}} musical styles. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, {{due in part to the}} acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West felt he had <b>become</b> <b>too</b> dependent on the technique, he decided to find a new sound.|$|E
