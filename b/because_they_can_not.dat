The claim is frequently made on behalf of African moral beliefs and customs that, in stark contrast with Western moral attitudes and practices, there is no comparable objectification and exploitation of other-than-human animals and nature. This paper investigates whether this claim is correct, by examining the status of animals in religious and philosophical thought, as well as traditional cultural practices, in Africa. I argue that moral perceptions and attitudes on the African continent remain resolutely anthropocentric. Although values like ubuntu (humanness) or ukama (relationality) have been expanded to include nonhuman nature, animals are characteristically not seen to have any rights, and human duties to them are almost exclusively “indirect”. I conclude by asking whether those who, following their own liberation, continue to exploit and oppress other creatures simply <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> are <b>not</b> thereby contributing to their own dehumanisation...|$|R

The occurrence of females bearing ripe eggs was used to approximate the timing of each spawning season.

This shift was linked to increasing water temperatures as recorded over the last 39 years with a temperature logger at the spawning site. In early spring water temperatures rose more slowly than in later spring. Thus, embryos and larvae were exposed to increasingly colder water at a stage that is critical for sex determination and pathogen resistance in other salmonids. In summer, however, fry were exposed to increasingly warmer temperatures. The changes in water temperatures that we found embryos, larvae, and fry were exposed to could be contributing to the decline in abundance that has occurred over the last 30 - 40 years...|$|R

6000|$|The truth is, {{that each}} {{elementary}} sound that enters into {{the composition of}} words is represented in our language by so many different combinations of letters, in different cases, that the child has very little clue {{from the sound of}} a syllable to guide him in the spelling of it. We ourselves, from long habit, have become so accustomed to what we call the right spelling--which, of course, means nothing more than the customary one--that we are apt to imagine, as has already been said, that there is some natural fitness in it; and a mode of representing the same sound, which in one case seems natural and proper, in another appears ludicrous and absurd. We smile to see laugh spelled larf, just as we should to see scarf spelled scaugh, or scalf, as in half; and we forget that this perception of apparent incongruity is entirely the result of long habit in us, and has no natural foundation, and that children can not be sensible of it, or have any idea of it whatever. They learn, in learning to talk, what sound serves as the name by which the drops of water that they find upon the grass in the morning is denoted, but they can have no clue whatever to guide them in determining which of the various modes by which precisely that sound is represented in different words, as dew, do, due, du, doo, and dou, is to be employed in this case, and they become involved in hopeless perplexity if they attempt to imagine [...] "how it ought to be spelled;" [...] and we think them stupid <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> extricate themselves from the difficulty on our calling upon them to [...] "think!"

6000|$|... § 4. It would {{nevertheless}} {{be a great}} error {{to assign}} only a trifling importance to the agency of eminent individuals, or of governments. It must not be concluded that the influence of either is small, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> bestow what the general circumstances of society, and the course of its previous history, have not prepared it to receive. Neither thinkers nor governments effect all that they intend, but in compensation they often produce important results which they did {{not in the least}} foresee. Great men, and great actions, are seldom wasted; they send forth a thousand unseen influences, more effective than those which are seen; and though nine out of every ten things done, with a good purpose, by those who are in advance of their age, produce no material effect, the tenth thing produces effects twenty times as great as any one would have dreamed of predicting from it. Even the men who for want of sufficiently favorable circumstances left no impress at all upon their own age, have often been of the greatest value to posterity. Who could appear to have lived more entirely in vain than some of the early heretics? They were burned or massacred, their writings extirpated, their memory anathematized, and their very names and existence left for seven or eight centuries in the obscurity of musty manuscripts—their history to be gathered, perhaps, only from the sentences by which they were condemned. Yet the memory of these men—men who resisted certain pretensions or certain dogmas of the Church in the very age in which the unanimous assent of Christendom was afterward claimed as having been given to them, and asserted as the ground of their authority—broke the chain of tradition, established a series of precedents for resistance, inspired later Reformers with the courage, and armed them with the weapons, which they needed when mankind were better prepared to follow their impulse. To this example from men, let us add another from governments. The comparatively enlightened rule of which Spain had the benefit during a considerable part of the eighteenth century, did not correct the fundamental defects of the Spanish people; and in consequence, though it did great temporary good, so much of that good perished with it, that it may plausibly be affirmed to have had no permanent effect. The case has been cited as a proof how little governments can do in opposition to the causes which have determined the general character of the nation. It does show how much there is which they can not do; but not that they can do nothing. Compare what Spain was at the beginning of that half-century of liberal government, with what she had become at its close. That period fairly let in the light of European thought upon the more educated classes; and it never afterward ceased to go on spreading. Previous to that time the change was in an inverse direction; culture, light, intellectual and even material activity, were becoming extinguished. Was it nothing to arrest this downward and convert it into an upward course? How much that Charles the Third and Aranda could not do, has been the ultimate consequence of what they did! To that half-century Spain owes that she has got rid of the Inquisition, that she has got rid of the monks, that she now has parliaments and (save in exceptional intervals) a free press, and the feelings of freedom and citizenship, and is acquiring railroads and all the other constituents of material and economical progress. In the Spain which preceded that era, {{there was not a single}} element at work which could have led to these results in any length of time, if the country had continued to be governed as it was by the last princes of the Austrian dynasty, or if the Bourbon rulers had been from the first what, both in Spain and in Naples, they afterward became.|$|E

This project comprised a conceptual analysis of how the Internet enhances parent–school relationships to support Ontario school board administrators seeking to implement such technology. The study’s literature review identified the links between Web 2. 0 technology, parent–school relationships, and effective parent engagement. A conceptual framework of the features of Web 2. 0 tools that promote social interaction was developed and used to analyze websites of three Ontario school boards. The analysis revealed that school board websites used static features such as email, newsletters, and announcements for communication and did not provide access to parents for providing feedback through Web 2. 0 features such as instant messaging. General recommendations were made so that school board administrators have the opportunity to implement changes in their school community with feasible modifications.

50|$|Fish {{and some}} members of their food chain have color receptors in their eyes {{optimized}} for the light of their “space”. Eyes that can see a single space color can detect changes in light intensity. This is equivalent to a world in black, white and shades of gray. In this simplest level of visual information processing, an animal can recognize that something is different in its space—i.e., that there is food or a predator “over there”. Most animals living in a lighted world have an additional visual resource: color vision. By definition, that requires that they have color receptors containing at least two different visual pigments. To efficiently perform this function in water illuminated with light, an aquatic animal would have visual pigments sensitive to the background “space” color and one or more visual pigments offset from this blue-green region, say, in the red or ultraviolet region of the spectrum. This imparts a clear survival advantage to these animals <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> detect <b>not</b> only changes in light intensity but also contrasts in color. Many fish, for example, have two color receptors, one in the blue region of the spectra (425-490 nm) {{and the other in}} the near UV (320-380 nm). Insects and shrimp, members of the fish food chain, have blue, green (530 nm) and near UV receptors. In fact, some aquatic animals have up to ten different classes of visual pigment in their eyes. By comparison, humans have three with maximum sensitivities in the blue (442 nm), green (543 nm) and yellow (570 nm). It is the differential responses of these receptor cells that enable color vision.|$|R

Depression is the most common mental illness associated to social comparison bias. Depression has a biological explanation to why people lose hope in life.

Another negative symptom that is associated to social comparison bias is suicide ideation. [...] "Suicide ideation can be defined as the constant thoughts about suicide and suicide attempts.

Linear accelerators use an array of oscillating electric fields, historically arranged in a line, but nothing would prevent a person from using magnets in between the columns of linear accelerators to form some other geometric shape. Oscillating field accelerators do not actually produce beams of particles, but rather packets of particles, unlike electrostatic accelerators which can have a beam current that is constant in time. Thus, the naming scheme for accelerators is based on the method of acceleration, or the physics, and not its geometry, which can be a point of confusion. In fact, it was the oscillating field design of the linear accelerator which inspired Lawrence to construct the cyclotron, which accelerates particles in a spiral, thus taking up a considerably smaller amount of space. A linear accelerator has more in common with a cyclotron than an electrostatic terminal accelerator.|$|R

The major challenges include the resolutions of deficient operational models such as: forgetting, chemical dependency of management, inability to make decisions, reluctance to start a dialogue, «cut-off» solutions and some others. Methodology. A desk and in-depth study is carried out of several national territorial stabilization programs dealing with the government that ensure infrastructural support to post-conflict regions and communities in the East of Ukraine. It is studied how the programs are managed by the controversy of the results-based and process-based approaches (2015 - 2016 data) via NGOs and subcontractors. Improving stabilization tools, it leverages transformation of its own systems into a firm yet flexible entity. Results of the research showed that stabilization project systems should seek {{a balance between the}} results-based and process-based ends of management, the first focusing on quicker and more flexible lower-level results, and the second building bureaucracy via continuous processes. Practical implementation. Regional subcontractors can improve satisfaction and widen participation by supporting informal initiative from the grassroots level. A good solution to resolve operational conflicts is hiring a helping hand to the administrator – a typical results-based manager who will help follow the harmony to achieve immediate results. Any improvement in the transparency of the system and the formalization of relations between the beneficiary and the subcontractor, shifted in addressing issues at the level below, does not require exclusive access to the principal decision-maker, and would simply and easily be implemented at the technical level of the beneficiary institutions.

The industry confronts growing worldwide demands for greater environmental quality, but now benefits from an emerging technological revolution that provides them with the tools to respond effectively to those demands. Rapid innovation is occurring in lightweight materials, various ICE powertrain enhancements made possible by computer controls, energy conversion processes, energy storage, and communication and information technologies. The challenge for automotive companies is to correctly anticipate policy and market demands, position oneself strategically with respect to environmental and other market issues – to distinguish opportunities from threats [...] and design and develop products accordingly. The most critical environment-related issues facing the automotive industry are regulation of particulate matter and greenhouse gases, and the development and marketing of electric drive technologies. Depending upon a company’s forecast and assessment of market demands, technological opportunities, and forthcoming regulations, it will invest in some mix of advanced diesel powerplants, direct injection gasoline engines, fuel cells, battery EVs, and various hybrid-ICE technologies. Critical choices must be and are being made, by government and industry. Companies cannot afford to make serious commitments to these technologies and must make strategic choices, and policymakers and regulators must respect the large investments imposed on companies by their actions and must therefore also be strategic (and rational) in prioritizing and acting upon problems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a review of}} two main groups of {{structural}} damage identification methods by dynamic tests is presented. The first group is concerned with metallic thin structures damages or imperfections and the second one with reinforced concrete beam structures damages. 1. The first group is addressed to the detection of potential imperfections, fissures and cracks appearing in industrial machines, aeronautical structures and motor engines. They are typically metallic structures and the tests are carried under controlled environment conditions, such as in a laboratory. The application of body waves, and more often, guided waves, as Rayleigh and Lamb waves, as dynamic excitation in order to detect the damage, is described. The studied imperfections have been divided into three classes. • Cracks, related to the structural safety. They are penetrating {{a significant part of}} the plate thickness. • The second class of imperfections are small cracks or fissures, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be called partially penetrating ones <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are extended only to a small part of the plate thickness. Imperfections of this class are difficult to detect, <b>because</b> sometimes <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be observed on the plate surfaces. • Finally, the third class of imperfections are the superficial cracks and they are more related to the durability of the structure than to its safety. These imperfections are more connected to structural protection to the environment, i. e. to protective painting and coating. Dynamic models used to detect the first class of imperfections have been Kirchhoff or Reissner bending thin plate. The crack detection can be achieved quite accurately by comparison between the first spatial derivatives of the mode shapes of the uncracked and cracked plates. Partially penetrating and superficial cracks have been identified by application as dynamic input of Lamb and Rayleigh waves respectively. The use of these guide waves seems to be a very promising technique for imperfection detection. However, computational problems appear. They are related to the small time step and the large number of the finite elements needed in order to reach a suitable accuracy level. 2. The second part of the paper treats a different group of dynamic identification and location of damage in civil and building structures. In particular the damage in reinforced concrete beams,typically used in bridge and building structures is studied. Detection procedures in this part differ of the first ones, because the existing structure is tested in the field and reinforced concrete is rather heterogenous material in comparison to metallic material. Normally, potential cracks are detected, during the free vibrations of the structure, by estimation of the changes either of its natural frequencies, or in its mode shapes or in the measure of its dynamic flexibility. However,in general, the differences of these values between uncracked and cracked beams are small and in some cases <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be distinguished from the inherent measurement errors occurring during the tests. After reviewing several different models applied to crack detection, one based on the linear elasticity has been developed. In this model the cracks are assumed to remain open and the rest of the structure to behave elastically, Using this model a sensitivity analysis of the presence of cracks,depth and location, respect to the variation of the structure natural frequencies and modes shapes can be carried out. Using this approach a crack identification methodology is proposed. Finally,some possible modifications of the proposed methodology aimed to improve the accuracy and reliability of the obtained results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Gentrification is {{the term}} applied to the process whereby middle-class people move into working class areas in the inner city, either {{residential}} areas, or old warehouses or sweatshops. This thesis seeks {{on the one hand}} to explain gentrification as the consequence of the development of domestic technologies, and on the other to understand it as a metaphor rooted in the characteristic experience of marginality in modern life. Debate over the causes of gentrification have polarized around two themes: that gentrification is the consequence of the rise of a new middle class heralding the onset of a post-industrial or post-modern society; or that gentrification is just another example of the contradictions underpinning capitalist development (in this case, the contradiction between the value of a building and the value of the land on which it sits - the rent gap hypothesis). This thesis argues that the falling cost of domestic technologies such as washing machines and vacuum cleaners has made it possible to bring the value of housing services which can be supplied by a Victorian house into line with the value of the housing services provided by the most modern house. Gentrification is then explained {{as a consequence of the}} middle classes taking advantage of the opportunity offered by these developments. In contrast to the explanations currently dominating the gentrification debate, this thesis therefore argues that gentrifiers gentrify <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> and <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have to. Consequently, the explanation of gentrification has nothing to do with questions of class, nor indeed of gender. Gentrification is a transient, not a cyclical phenomenon, and would have occurred whether the process was carried out entirely by women or entirely by men. The currently dominant explanations of gentrification argue that gentrifiers gentrify <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have to as they are subject to forces beyond their control: the rise of post- industrial society; or the reappearance of accumulation crises in capitalist urban development. These explanations are then left with the problem, not of explaining the existence of gentrification in those inner-city areas where it does occur, but in explaining its absence from all those other inner-city areas in which it does not occur, since they are couched in such general terms that they could apply to every member of the middle classes or to every inner city area, not just those associated with gentrification. These explanations of gentrification therefore over-estimate its quantitative significance, also. The fact that this over-estimation occurs is however of great interest. Using arguments derived from Robert Park and Raymond Williams, this thesis suggests that the reason for this is that gentrification touches on many characteristic insecurities of modern life. Gentrification therefore has resonances far wider than its quantitative significance would suggest. 'Gentrification' is a metaphorical expression, derived from 'gentry', the rural landowning classes. Gentrification can best be understood, therefore, in terms of attempts to realize an Arcadian (and class) vision of the 'country': a stable retreat in the very heart of the everchanging and often threatening 'city'. Insofar as gentrification represents a particular strategy for dealing with a universally experienced condition, the study of gentrification illuminates the way we live now...|$|R
40|$|Indonesian Manpower (TKI) {{who goes}} {{overseas}} {{has an important}} role in state and nation’s life. In economical sectors, the TKI has given an income for foreign exchange of the country. Their hardworking in foreign countries has also become the source of The Original State Income (PAD) for places where they come from. The contribution that has been contributed to the country, in fact, does not yet change the organization system of the TKI’s wisdom that has basic concepts in protecting the TKI itself. The deportation of the TKI with label the illegal TKI is very common happening in our country with various reasons or the way of going abroad that is its background. This research has made the research problems: 1. What kinds of factors that makes the TKI going abroad illegally? 2. What are the efforts of the State Government of Tuban in handling many departures of the illegal TKI?. This research uses juridical sociological method, with the qualitative data analysis. The observation is located in Kecamatan Palang, Tuban Regency. The data that are taken in this research {{is the result of the}} field observation and interview with the state government officers of Disnakerduk and Capil and also the state government officers of Tuban Regancy. From the result of the research, the data we get that the society prefer going abroad illegally <b>because</b> <b>they</b> feel <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> complete their daily necessities with only working in their town with the low salary, and also the departure process of the illegal TKI is easier, which are the cost is cheaper, does not need the administration requirements, the departure process is faster, and of course does not need a special training from the government in handling many departures of the illegal TKI. To solve this problem is not easy enough, and the efforts of the state government in solving this problem are not maximal because: the state government of Tuban includes all of the government officers are not serious in handling the unoriginal documents of the TKI that want to work overseas, the problems that are faced by the TKI, both the TKI in foreign countries and the TKI in Indonesia that want to go abroad have the same problems with scalpers or PJTKI, that are handled by the state government are not serious to solve this problem, the solving problems are just giving the financial change or the insurance, and sometimes they do not get the insurance. The societies also do not follow against the rule and regulation policy and do not want the government get involved in handling the problem of the illegal TKI...|$|R

It {{comes from}} the words Anak Layangan (A = anak + Lay = layangan), which means children who hunts the cut-off kites on the streets <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> afford to buy themselves the kite (layangan).

40|$|M. Ed. This {{dissertation}} took as {{point of}} departure the problem definition of {{the report of the}} HSRC Working Committee on Curriculation {{and a great deal of}} attention was given to the curriculating role of the teacher at micro (classroom) level. The researcher tried to determine from available literature on this subject, what the viewpoint of other researchers were on the teacher's curriculating task at micro level. Almost without exception researchers were convinced that the teacher should play an important part as far as curriculum design, implementation and development are concerned. The researcher came to the conclusion that a lot of the reseachers are of the opinion that the word "curriculating" or "to curriculate" is part and parcel only of the meso (departmental) level, but in actual fact this term can only be relevant at the micro level. It is only the teacher who can actually "curriculate". People involved in curriculum development at the meso level can be called curriculum designers. Both teachers and curriculum designers are making use of the principles related to curriculum design, but they apply it in different ways. The second chapter was dedicated to the participants at the micro level. The two parties that play an active role at micro level are the teacher and the pupil, but there are also other people who are involved in the politics of education at micro level. Special attention was given to the teacher's role as curriculating and curriculum development agent in this regard. A proposal which flows from this dissertation is that student teachers and acting teachers must in one way or another be educated/trained to handle curriculum development as an applied skill. A training model for student teachers is also proposed, which should enable them to handle any given curriculum in a skilful way. In chapter 4 the assumptions that were made in the beginning of the study were tested against data obtained by means of an empirical survey. The data which has been obtained, confirmed the point of view that teachers feel that they have no say in matters related to the curriculum; that they are not trained properly in the handling of curricula and <b>because</b> of this <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> act as professionals. If the authorities were willing to adopt the recommendations proferred in this study it should lead to a more professional approach to curriculating, teaching and learning...|$|R
