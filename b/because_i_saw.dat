500|$|Romany King's jockey Adrian Maguire said: [...] "Going to The Chair, I {{wondered}} {{what the hell was}} going on <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a fellow wandering nonchalantly across the fence. There were two cones in front of it, but the horses still in the race all kept going." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon his {{accession}} to the throne, he had hopes of marrying Catherine II, writing {{to her on}} 2 November 1763 {{in a moment of}} doubt, [...] "If I desired the throne, it was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you on it." [...] When she made it clear through his envoy Rzewuski that she would not marry him, there were hopes of an Austrian archduchess.|$|E
500|$|In 1978, Washington {{teenager}} MacKaye discovered {{punk rock}} through a local college radio station, Georgetown University's WGTB. He met Nelson, a classmate of his, after the latter {{set off a}} pipe bomb outside their school and MacKaye went to investigate. The two became friends and quickly discovered their shared interest in punk. MacKaye and Nelson saw their first punk show in January 1979—a benefit concert by the Cramps for WGTB. The concert inspired the pair; MacKaye later admitted, [...] "It blew my mind <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{for the first time}} this huge, totally invisible community that had gathered together for this tribal event. [...] I thought, 'This appeals to me. This is the world I think I can breathe in. This is what I need'".|$|E
6000|$|... "There you mistake me. <b>I</b> {{married him}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> loved him, but I won't say that I didn't love him partly <b>because</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{a promise of}} that life in him." ...|$|R
60|$|I said nothing. The display {{was exactly}} {{according}} to the guide-book, and were we not traveling by the guide-book? I selected a certain horse <b>because</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him shy, and I thought that a horse that had spirit enough to shy {{was not to be}} despised.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind," [...] said Herbert, [...] "and I will accept your amendment. It {{will be the}} better plan, <b>because</b> if <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> your brother, <b>I</b> should {{certainly}} interfere with his work. He might insist upon coming to help me, which {{is not at all}} necessary. Where can I find the gig, Miss Haverley?" ...|$|R
2500|$|ARMITAGE: They're not {{words on}} which I disagree. I {{think it was}} {{extraordinarily}} foolish of me. There was no ill-intent on my part and I had never seen ever, in 43 years of having a security clearance, a covert operative's name in a memo. The only reason I knew a [...] "Mrs. Wilson", not [...] "Mrs. Plame", worked at the agency was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it in a memo. But I don't disagree with her words to a large measure.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} {{interview}} with SheWired.com, Michael K {{was asked to}} name {{the reason for the}} blog's success. He said, [...] "I don't know. I never promoted it. I never advertised. That was never my goal. I think it was that my friends would read it and they'd send it to their friends. I used to post personal pictures and stuff <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it as both a personal blog and a blog about just things that I like. So that's when I decided I wasn't going to make it personal. I was just going to cover this and focus on that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, David Callaham pitched {{his take}} on Godzilla to Legendary and Warner Bros. and was hired to write the first draft. Speaking of his draft, Callaham stated, [...] "Godzilla is a pretty cut and dry, giant monster that smashes stuff. But the reason I got excited about it is <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> themes and {{relationships}} to the modern world that I could tell in this story that was important." [...] Callaham did research on Godzilla's history, animal documentaries, as well as natural disasters and local government disaster plannings in order to depict the events {{as close as possible}} to real-life disasters.|$|E
5000|$|Their {{music is}} {{influenced}} by Stargate, especially the theatrical film. In an interview, frontman Nils K. Rue said: [...] "I wouldn't say I like the TV series Stargate, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> an entire episode of that. But I really like the film Stargate. Of course, I took some inspiration from that..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose they}} haven't, and vessels {{belonging}} to neutral countries {{ought to be}} safe," [...] said Dick. [...] "Still, the Spanish company seem to have changed their sailings, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> one of their boats yesterday; {{but she was a}} long way off on the horizon." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus <b>I</b> spoke then, <b>because</b> <b>I,</b> too, <b>saw</b> {{the evil}} of the Isanusis, I who knew their secrets. Also, I feared for my own life and for {{the lives of all}} those who were dear to me. For they hated me as one {{instructed}} in their magic, one who had the seeing eye and the hearing ear.|$|R
2500|$|He {{has been}} {{described}} as a neoconservative by some commentators, for his support of maintaining U.S. troops to rebuild society after successful military interventions, and has stated, [...] "I came to support neocon approaches first in the wars against the Taliban and Saddam, largely <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> little alternative." [...] In 2005, Hanson wrote of why he did not find the Democratic Party populist or reflective of its prior concerns. [...] "The Democratic Party reminds me of the Republicans circa 1965 or so—impotent, shrill, no ideas, conspiratorial, reactive, out-of-touch with most Americans, isolationist, and full of embarrassing spokesmen." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 6 October 2011, Emin {{opened a}} {{site-specific}} exhibition at a Georgian house on Fitzroy Square. The title {{is taken from}} her novel which {{has served as a}} catalyst for a series of works, created for a neoclassical house designed by Robert Adam in 1794. The exhibition also featured a series of embroidered texts and hand-woven tapestries which continued Emin's interest in domestic and handcrafted traditions. Emin herself has said that, [...] "I called it that <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> part of myself as drying and not there anymore and I wanted to question the whole idea of love and passion, whether love exists anymore...Why? Because I'm nearly 50, I'm single, because I don't have children." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} time, the Israeli Prime Minister (Levi Eshkol), the Israeli Defense Forces Chief of Staff, and Knesset members came to games. Demand for tickets to {{games in the}} team's 5,000-seat stadium was so high that they became {{exceedingly}} difficult to obtain. [...] In his down time, Brody coached Israeli soldiers when they were off duty from guarding Israel's border against its Arab neighbors. [...] The experience, and the excitement Brody generated, made a deep impression on him. [...] He {{had a vision of}} what he could accomplish, and saw the positive impact on the Israeli people's morale whenever Maccabi Tel Aviv beat a team in Europe. As he put it: [...] "I felt it was bigger than me, and had to be continued, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> what the results were." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean, Baas, that I {{hope they}} are in heaven, <b>because</b> when last <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> them they were both dead, and dead people must be either in heaven or hell, and heaven, they say, is better than hell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> loved you; <b>because,</b> when <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> you <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{the only}} man that was my master, and <b>I</b> rebelled; <b>because,</b> when <b>I</b> found I {{could not help but}} love you, I knew I never had loved before, and I would wipe out with one stroke all the past that rose in {{judgment}} against me; <b>because</b> <b>I</b> would not have you ever confronted with one endearing word of mine that was not meant for you." ...|$|R
30|$|I {{had a very}} {{different}} perspective <b>because</b> <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> MHM as part of community services…It was always part of WASH for us. It was {{the responsibility of the}} NFI people. But after the workshop, I was able to see that actually it cuts through all the sectors. That it was the responsibility of all the sectors. It is very difficult to separate such issues now.|$|R
2500|$|... 28th May, 1719. I {{went to see}} {{her last}} Sunday, the 23rd May, and found her in a sad state, {{suffering}} from pains in her toes and the soles of her feet until the tears came into her eyes. I went away <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that she refrained from crying out on my account. I thought {{she was in a}} bad way. A consultation was held by her three physicians, the result of which was that they determined to bleed her in the feet. They had some difficulty in persuading her to submit to it, because the pain in her feet was so great that she uttered the most piercing screams if the bedclothes only rubbed against them. The bleeding, however, succeeded, and she was in some degree relieved. It was the gout in both feet ...|$|E
2500|$|... Guru Tegh Bahadur, sacrificed {{his head}} to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity. In the late seventeenth century, Guru Gobind Singh Ji (the tenth guru in Sikhism), was in war with the Mughal rulers {{to protect the people}} of {{different}} faiths when a fellow Sikh, Bhai Kanhaiya, attended the troops of the enemy. He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield."What were you doing, and why?" [...] asked the Guru. [...] "I was giving water to the wounded <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> your face in all of them," [...] replied Bhai Kanhaiya. The Guru responded, [...] "Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wendy Leigh, {{who wrote}} an {{unofficial}} biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise {{from an early}} age using the movie business and bodybuilding as building blocks to escape a depressing home. Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, [...] "I {{wanted to be part of}} the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> leaders use 100% of their potential– I was always fascinated by people in control of other people." [...] Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, [...] "I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and Sargent Shriver became my heroes." [...] Eunice Kennedy Shriver was sister of John F. Kennedy, and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger.|$|E
5000|$|Stein {{finally asked}} my opinion on people being fired for {{endorsing}} Intelligent Design. I replied that I {{know of no}} instance where such a firing has happened. This seemingly innocent observation {{was turned into a}} filmic confession of ignorance when my on-camera interview abruptly ends there, <b>because</b> when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Expelled at a preview screening... I discovered that the central thesis of the film is a conspiracy theory about the systematic attempt to keep Intelligent Design creationism out of American classrooms and culture.|$|R
60|$|I rose, {{and praying}} my patron, good St. Hubert after whom <b>I</b> was named <b>because</b> <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> light upon his day, the 23rd of November, {{to give me}} skill, I drew the great bow to my ear, aimed, and loosed. Nor did St. Hubert, a lover of fine shooting, fail me in my need, for that arrow rushed out and found its home in the big mouth of the Frenchman, through which it passed, pinning his foul tongue to his neck bone.|$|R
5|$|I went to Iraq <b>because</b> what <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> when <b>I</b> {{was over}} there was soldiers—young kids for the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get {{hospitals}} open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these {{young men and women}} who are over there fighting to help this country.|$|R
2500|$|Boam {{abandoned}} King's parallel story {{structure for}} The Dead Zones screenplay, turning the plot into separate episodes. Boam told writer Tim Lucas in 1983, [...] "King's book {{is longer than}} it needed to be. The novel sprawls and it's episodic. What I did was use that episodic quality, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> The Dead Zone as a triptych." [...] His script was revised and condensed four times by Cronenberg, who eliminated large portions of the novel's story, including plot points about Johnny Smith having a brain tumor. Cronenberg, Boam, and Hill had script meetings to revise the screenplay page by page. Boam's [...] "triptych" [...] in the screenplay surrounds three acts: the introduction of Johnny Smith before his car accident and after he awakes from a coma, a story about Smith assisting a sheriff track down the Castle Rock Killer, and finally Johnny deciding to confront the politician Stillson. Boam said that he enjoyed writing the character development for Smith, having him struggle with the responsibility of his psychic abilities, and ultimately give up his life for the greater good. [...] "It was this theme that made me like the book, and I particularly enjoyed discovering it in what was essentially a genre piece, a work of exploitation," [...] he said. In Boam's first draft of the screenplay, Johnny doesn't die at the end, but rather has a vision about the Castle Rock Killer, who is still alive and escaped from prison. Cronenberg insisted that this [...] "trick ending" [...] be revised. Boam submitted the final draft of the screenplay on November 8, 1982.|$|E
