5|$|Like many Elizabethan mansions, Barrington {{is built}} in an 'E' shape with large {{projecting}} wings with square projections that contain staircases. The {{house is not}} truly symmetrical as the hall has two lights and the <b>buttery</b> one. The south front has seven gables supported by octagonal buttresses and decorated with twisted finials with ogee scale-work caps and English Crockets.|$|E
5|$|The hall has a hammerbeam roof; {{the louvre}} in the centre is now glazed, but was {{originally}} {{the only means}} of escape for smoke rising from a fireplace in the centre of the floor. The wooden panelling was designed by Ninian Comper and was erected in 1911 in place of some previous 19th-century Gothic type, though even earlier panelling, dating from 1710, is evident in the <b>Buttery.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{the west}} of the reredorter block was the <b>buttery,</b> a room where the monks' wine (some of it direct from the king's cellars at Southampton) and beer were stored. Excavations in this area have {{revealed}} fragmentary remains which may be part of a separate kitchen for the richer diet allowed to the residents of the infirmary.|$|E

5|$|Deep-fried {{butter is}} a snack food {{comprising}} butter that is {{coated with a}} batter or breading and then deep-fried. The dish has been served at several fairs in the United States; among them, the State Fair of Texas in Dallas, Texas, and the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa; {{and now it is}} served worldwide. It has a significant <b>buttery</b> flavor, which has been compared to that of French toast. Fried butter is a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Durian {{flowers are}} large and {{feathery}} with copious nectar, and give off a heavy, sour, and <b>buttery</b> odour. These features are typical of flowers pollinated by certain species of bats that eat nectar and pollen. According to research conducted in Malaysia in the 1970s, durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats (Eonycteris spelaea); however, a 1996 study indicated two species, D. grandiflorus and D. oblongus, were pollinated by spiderhunters (Nectariniidae) and another species, D. kutejensis, was pollinated by giant honey bees and birds as well as bats.|$|E
5000|$|Articles in the Aberdeen Journal {{from early}} in the 19th century bemoan the {{increased}} use of lard in place of butter in traditional [...] "butter rolls". In 1917 when restrictions were placed on the sale of bread due to World War I, <b>butteries</b> were exempt thus permitting Aberdeen bakers to continue to produce rowies; this was rescinded a few months later but appeals were made on the grounds that <b>butteries</b> were an intrinsic [...] "part of the food of the working classes in industrial centres." [...] Aberdeen City Food Control Committee continued to challenge the validity of the restriction two years later in February 1919.|$|R

5|$|In {{the south}} range, {{parts of the}} medieval {{buildings}} survive and are incorporated into staircase ten — the straight, steep flight of stairs and timber framed partitions date from a mid-15th century rebuilding of St Mary Hall. The former Chapel, Hall and <b>Buttery</b> of St Mary Hall, built in 1640, form part of the Junior Library and Junior Common Room. Viewed from the third quad, the Chapel, with its Gothic windows, {{can be seen to}} have been built neatly on top of the Hall, a unique example in Oxford of such a plan.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{refectory}} (dining hall) {{range to}} the south of the cloister and the dorter range to the east, which contained the chapter house and dormitory, have yet to be excavated. Only the western end of the refectory range has been excavated; it presents a vaulted undercroft, three bays of which survive, above which the refectory was located on the first floor. A service passage survives between the kitchen and the refectory. The western part of the undercroft was used as a <b>buttery</b> in the late Middle Ages but would have had severely restricted headroom due to its raised floor.|$|E
5|$|The Pitched Stone Court {{forms the}} {{north-east}} {{corner of the}} castle, and provided a centre for the castle services and servants; it {{takes its name from}} the late-Tudor cobbling, or pitched stones. On {{the east side of the}} court is the former office wing, a 16th-century construction mostly destroyed during the siege of 1646. The castle kitchens and pantries are on the north side, containing two large fireplaces and storage facilities for food and supplies in their cellars. In the 1460s, the first floors to these buildings included chambers for the senior servants. The <b>buttery</b> in the north-west corner would have been used to store and serve beer and wine.|$|E

5|$|The {{house is}} laid out around a large central hall {{connecting}} the mansion's two gabled end-pieces, which was used for dining. The other major rooms {{on the ground floor}} are the withdrawing room {{to the right of the}} hall, and the <b>buttery</b> and kitchen to the left; there is also a small entrance porch at the main Hospital Street entrance. The first floor has five main rooms: the upper hall (never open to the roof) and four solars (private upper rooms, some of which would have contained beds), as well as a small chapel. The attic is divided into five rooms and provided servants' accommodation.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the inner}} ward was the castle's Great Hall and accommodation. Caerphilly was built with fashionable, high-status accommodation, {{similar to that}} built {{around the same time}} in Chepstow Castle. In the medieval period the Great Hall would have been {{subdivided}} with wooden screens, colourful decorations, with rich, detailed carving and warmed by a large, central fireplace. Some carved medieval corbels in the shape of male and female heads survive in the hall today, possibly depicting the royal court in the 1320s, including Edward II, Isabella of France, Hugh Despenser and Eleanor de Clare. To the east of the Great Hall was the castle chapel, positioned above the <b>buttery</b> and pantry. On {{the west side of the}} hall were the castle's private apartments, two solar blocks with luxurious fittings.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th {{century the}} Lower Ward was rebuilt in stone by Reynold Mohun; this {{was paid for}} in part by Reynold {{commuting}} his tenants' ongoing duty to repair the castle walls into a single, one-off financial payment to their lord, and partially through his marriage to a rich local heiress. A survey of the castle in 1266 described the Upper Ward {{on the top of}} the motte as containing a hall with a <b>buttery,</b> a pantry, a kitchen, a bakehouse, the chapel of Saint Stephen and a knight's hall, guarded by three towers. The Lower Ward included a granary, two towers and a gatehouse; one of the towers, called the Fleming Tower, was used as a prison. The castle stables lay outside the defences, further down the slope. By the end of the 13th century some of the castle's roofing had been covered in lead, while other parts still used wooden shingles.|$|E

50|$|In the {{southern}} range of buildings {{there is evidence}} of the position of the refectory by the indication of the reader's desk at one of the windows in south side wall. Although this range is not now divided by cross walls, {{it is likely that the}} eastern end was occupied by the calefactory, or warming house, and the western end by the <b>butteries</b> and kitchen. Excavation in the cloister garth has revealed the foundations of the lavabo, occupying the usual position in near the door of the refectory.|$|R
5|$|The Great Hall at {{the centre}} of the north range is entered through a porch and screens passage, a feature common in houses of the period, {{designed}} to protect the occupants from draughts. As the screens are now missing, they may have been free-standing like those at Rufford Old Hall. The porch is decorated with elaborate carvings. The Great Hall's roof is supported by arch-braced trusses, which are decorated with carved motifs including dragons. The floor, now flagged, would probably originally have been rush-covered earth, with a central hearth. The gabled bay window overlooking the courtyard was added in 1559. The original service wing {{to the west of the}} Great Hall, behind the screens passage, was rebuilt in 1546, and housed a kitchen, <b>buttery</b> and pantry. A hidden shaft was discovered during a 19th-century investigation of two secret rooms above the kitchen, connecting them to a tunnel leading to the moat, the entrance to which has since been filled in. The west range now houses the gift shop and restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The Lion Tower was the {{entrance}} to {{the north end of the}} great hall. Above the archway through the tower were displayed heraldic items, symbolic of the Percy earls' power. The lion at the bottom was the emblem of the earls. Though now much damaged, above the lion were the ancient arms of the family and the arms of the Lucy family, whose property the Percys had inherited in the 1380s. As the tower was entered from the bailey, on the right was a doorway leading to the incomplete collegiate church. To the left was the great hall, and beyond that, withdrawing chambers; to the right were the <b>buttery,</b> pantry, larder, and kitchen. Immediately north of the kitchen was a postern tower. Built around 1200, its upper floors were later reused for accommodation. An entrance of lesser status than the main gatehouse, the gate's position next to the kitchen suggests it was a tradesmen's entrance, used for conveying supplies to the castle.|$|E
5|$|The bailey was {{designed}} to include a number of spacious domestic buildings. These include a great hall, a solarium, kitchen, <b>buttery</b> and pantry, with a luxuriously large number of gardrobes and fireplaces. The large towers provided additional accommodation. The design of the domestic buildings was skilfully interlocked to support the defensive arrangements of the bailey. The great hall for example, , {{was placed in the}} strongest position overlooking the river Wye, allowing it to benefit from multiple large windows and a huge fireplace without sacrificing defensive strength. Water for the castle was originally raised from the courtyard well, but was later piped in from a spring across the valley; the castle kitchens had acquired running water {{by the beginning of the}} 17th century. The design of the buildings ensured that the servants and nobility were able to live separately from one another in the confined space of the castle, revolutionary at the time.|$|E

There's good water in the courtyard well and those who owned this tower, whoever they may have been, laid in great store, perchance for the marriage feast, or perchance when the plague began, knowing that it would bring scarcity. The cupboards and the <b>butteries</b> are filled with flour, dried flesh, wine, olives and oil for burning. Even if these should fail us there are the horses in the stable, which we can kill and cook, for of forage and fuel I have found enough." ...|$|R

Students live in suites of six single rooms. These small-scale communities are arranged vertically in residential towers, which contain both student suites and faculty apartments. Floors are grouped into neighborhoods, each with its own skygarden, a landscaped outdoor space for high-rise buildings that was pioneered in Singapore.|$|R

5|$|John died in 1216 and was {{succeeded by}} his nine-year-old son, Henry, {{with the support}} of the barons. With no {{prospect}} of becoming King of England, Louis returned to France. Rochester Castle was returned to royal control in 1217. Given the damage incurred during John's siege, the castle was in dire need of repairs. Between 1217 and 1237 around £680 were spent on repairs, of which £530 were taken up by work on the keep. In 1225 and 1226 the town walls were enhanced by the addition of a ditch at the cost of £300. The new ditch enclosed Boley Hill, possibly to deny the position to future aggressors who might attack the castle. Repairs began with the castle's outer curtain wall. At the same time a chapel was built within the castle. In 1226 the hall, <b>buttery,</b> and dispensary were repaired. Work probably did not begin on the keep until 1226. It was mostly repaired by 1227, but work continued on it until 1232. During 1230 and 1231 a stone wall dividing the castle's enclosure into two parts was built which no longer survives. While attention was paid to making the castle a working fortification, Henry III also funded construction of residential and other buildings. In 1244, £132 was spent on building a second chapel next to the royal apartments. Stables and an almonry were added in 1248. The main gatehouse was rebuilt between 1249 and 1250 at a cost of over £120. Further repairs were carried out on the keep in 1256, this time costing more than £120. Later in the decade further attention was paid to the castle's defences, possibly in response to HenryIII's worsening relations with his barons.|$|E

This sad duty finished, they washed themselves with water from the well, and breakfasted. After they had eaten they consulted as to what they should do next.|$|R
