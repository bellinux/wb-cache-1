40|$|AbstractManufacturers of {{veterinary}} vaccines frequently incorporate animal-based <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> safety tests into their quality assurance monitoring protocols {{to meet their}} internal quality standards and to conform to government regulatory requirements. These tests are conducted by vaccinating target species animals or laboratory animals with a single dose or multiple doses of the test batch, and observing the vaccinated animals for signs of local or systemic adverse reactions. Manufacturers, standard-setting bodies, animal welfare advocacy groups, and regulatory agencies are actively investigating alternative methods to reduce their reliance on animal-based methods for <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> safety testing. Approaches which have been implemented or proposed include harmonizing technical requirements, developing in vitro tests, refining the existing animal tests, improving adverse reaction monitoring (vaccinovigilance), and improving manufacturing methods and quality controls to reduce batch-to-batch variability. An approach, known as the consistency approach, is increasingly being acknowledged as a potentially viable alternative to animal-based <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> tests for vaccines. This paper will {{provide an overview of}} currently utilized <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> safety tests for veterinary vaccines, the associated regulatory requirements, and some potentially acceptable alternative approaches for reducing, refining, and replacing the use of animals in these tests...|$|E

The consistency approach is based upon thorough characterisation of the vaccine during development and the principle that the quality of subsequent batches is the consequence of the strict application of a quality system and of a consistent production of batches.

40|$|Polyclonal and {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{are often}} used in regulatory testing of biologicals (vaccines and related prod-ucts). One {{of the most common}} applications for antibody-based immunoassays is as a <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> test. <b>Batch</b> <b>release</b> tests, whether they measure serological responses to vacci-nation or they quantify individual antigens by in vitro meth-ods, must provide an acceptable estimate of potency of an individual batch of vaccine. Thus, due consideration must be given to the type of antibody used or quantified in such assays. Differences in specificity and avidity may affect the utility of an assay as an indicator of potency; case examples are given to illustrate these concepts. Concerns associated with antigen quantification assays (e. g., reagent denatur-ation upon binding to solid substrates, and interference from nontarget antigens or additives in a complex vaccine) are also discussed. International efforts to harmonize test meth-ods in recent years have increased the importance of estab-lishing standardized antibodies.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are pivotal in the {{induction}} of adaptive immune responses {{because they can}} activate naive T-cells. Moreover, they steer these adap-tive immune responses by integrating various stimuli, such as from different pathogen associated molecular patterns and the cytokine milieu. Immature DC are very well capable of ingesting protein antigens, whereas mature DC are effi-cient presenters of peptides to naive T cells. Human DC can be readily cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which are isolated from human blood. There is a strong need to moni-tor in a high-throughput fashion the immunogenicity of candidate vaccines {{during the process of}} vaccine develop-ment.

The resulting complexes were characterized and assayed by <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> and column leaching tests, aiming at the controlled release of these herbicides. All the tested LDH-herbicide complexes displayed similar slow herbicide release properties in water, although the IE method seemed {{to result in}} complexes with a greater fraction of herbicide in a readily available form. Apparently, the LDH-herbicide complexes released most of the active ingredient present in the complexes {{at the end of}} the <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> experiment. This was attributed to the replacement of the intercalated herbicide by carbonate and hydroxyl anions from the aqueous solution. Compared to the free herbicides, the application of the three LDH-herbicide complexes (RE) to soil columns resulted in reduction in the maximum herbicide concentration in leachates and led to the retardation of herbicide leaching through the soil. All LDH-herbicide complexes presented an herbicidal efficacy similar to that of the free (technical) herbicides.

40|$|Aerobic {{granulation}} from floccular sludge {{is difficult}} to detect in first stages with the naked eye.

Two different scenarios are presented: one in which both granularities are present, and another scenario for which the granular state is not initially available. Analysis reported pH as the key variable in the transition between both states according to its variation, and that, in general, the granularity of the process can be correctly predicted {{at the end of the}} anaerobic phase.

40|$|<b>Batch</b> (wave) <b>release</b> {{policies}} are prevalent in warehouses with an automated sorter, and take different forms {{depending on how}} <b>batches</b> <b>released</b> consecutively may overlap downstream in the sorter. Continuous (waveless) release constitutes an emerging alternative recently adopted by several firms. Although that new policy presents several advantages relative to waves, it requires more expensive technology and involves the possibility of congestion-induced collapse (gridlock) at the sorter. Using an extensive data set of detailed warehouse flow information from a leading U. S. online retailer, we first develop a model with validated predictive accuracy for a warehouse operating under waveless release. We then use that model to compute operational guidelines for dynamically managing the main control lever of that policy {{with the goal of}} maximizing throughput while keeping the risk of gridlock under a specified threshold. Second, we leverage that model and data set to compare the performance of wave-based and waveless policies through simulation. The best waveless policy yields larger or equal throughput than the best wave-based policy in all scenarios considered, and thus appears to merit some consideration by practitioners. inventory theory and control, production planning and scheduling, dynamic programming, queueing theory, simulation...|$|R

Human blood products {{as a possible}} way for transmiting some viruses, represent potential danger for the donor pacient.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the early}} 1900 s, the {{abnormal}} toxicity test (ATT) was developed as an auxiliary means to ensure safe and consistent antiserum production. Today, the ATT is utilized as a quality control (QC) release test according to pharmacopoeial or other regulatory requirements. The study design {{has not been}} changed since around 1940. The evidence of abnormal toxicity testing as a prediction for harmful batches is highly questionable and lacks a scientific rationale. Numerous reviews of historical ATT results have revealed that no reliable conclusions {{can be drawn from}} this QC measure. Modern pharmaceutical manufacturers have thorough control of the manufacturing process and comply with good manufacturing practice rules. Contaminants are appropriately controlled by complying with the validated manufacturing processes and strict QC <b>batch</b> <b>release</b> confirming batch-to-batch consistency. Recognizing that product safety, efficacy, and stability can be ensured with strict QC measures, nowadays most regulatory authorities do not require the ATT for most product classes.
