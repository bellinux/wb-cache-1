40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{existing}} {{approach to}} constitutive modelling <b>of</b> <b>structured</b> soils {{is in this}} paper applied to hypoplastic models. The proposed approach {{is based on the}} modication of the state boundary surface {{in such a way that}} the models predict different stress-dilatancy <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>structured</b> and reference materials. The concept is applied to hypoplastic models for both clays and for granular materials. Good predictive capabilities of the modied model for clays are demonstrated, model for granular materials requires further modications in order to take into account different small- to medium- strain <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>structured</b> and reference materials. ...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{predictive}} model, {{referred to}} as Structured Cam Clay (SCC), was proposed recently by the authors. SCC was formulated for representing the mechanical <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> natural soils.

40|$|It is {{much more}} {{difficult}} to predict the dynamic <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> elastic-plastic <b>structures</b> compared with the corresponding quasi-static one because of complicated loading conditions and the effect of inertia. By assuming that the quasi-static structural and interface <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> a <b>structure</b> is specified and its dynamic deformation mode is similar to the quasi-static one, two mechanical models, namely the Stick Model and the Non-Stick Model, are proposed in order to predict the dynamic <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the <b>structure</b> under a rigid-body impact. Each model contains two lumped masses and two linear/non-linear springs. Whilst spring (2) represents the mechanical property of the interface between the structure and the impinger, spring (1) represents the elastic-plastic <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the <b>structure,</b> no matter the latter is strain-hardening, perfectly plastic or strain-softening in the plastic stage. With the complicated deformation history involving loading, unloading and reversed loading being taken into account, the large dynamic deformation process can be completely traced and the final deformation can be predicted by these models. Finally, to verify the validity of the mechanical models proposed for real structures, impact tests on simply supported beams were conducted and the agreement is good...|$|R
