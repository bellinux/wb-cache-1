5|$|In the story, <b>Booster</b> Gold {{is charged}} by Rip Hunter {{to go back}} in time and save Barbara from being shot by the Joker. <b>Booster</b> arrives at the {{carnival}} shortly after the Joker has rounded up the freaks, only to be attacked by them. He manages to escape (after the Joker torments him), but arrives too late to save Barbara. Catching the Joker in the middle of taking photos of the wounded Barbara (after having struck down Commissioner Gordon), <b>Booster</b> attacks the Joker in a rage; the Joker nevertheless gains the upper hand, snapping several photos of <b>Booster</b> as well. Rip removes <b>Booster</b> moments before he is killed, but <b>Booster</b> demands to be sent back again. <b>Booster</b> fails several times until Rip reveals that the Joker is destined to paralyze her, as it would ensure that she would become Oracle. Rip did this to demonstrate to <b>Booster</b> that some points in time, like Barbara's paralysis, are fixed and cannot be prevented or altered, so that <b>Booster</b> would not continue insisting on rescuing his friend Ted Kord from death, another fixed point.|$|E
5|$|The study {{undertaken}} by the Space Technology Laboratory suggested {{the use of a}} Thor-Hydra <b>booster,</b> however the more capable and more readily available Atlas-Agena B <b>booster</b> was selected instead. In phase two they switched {{to the use of the}} Atlas-Centaur <b>booster,</b> instead of an Atlas-Agena B <b>booster.</b>|$|E
5|$|The story {{also reveals}} that Batman kept {{the photos of}} Barbara and <b>Booster,</b> and had been waiting until <b>Booster</b> came of age before confronting him. Batman thanks <b>Booster</b> for {{trying to stop the}} Joker and offers him his friendship. Eventually, Dick Grayson, who becomes his mentor's {{temporary}} successor as Batman, would also learn about this and offer his thanks as well.|$|E

50|$|Such later {{versions}} are often seen with strap-on <b>boosters.</b> These layouts are designated by suffixes after the generation number. First {{is the total}} number of <b>boosters,</b> then letters designating liquid- or solid-fueled stages. For example, an Ariane 42P is an Ariane 4 with two solid-fuel <b>boosters.</b> An Ariane 44LP has two solid, two liquid <b>boosters,</b> and a 44L has four liquid-fuel <b>boosters.</b>|$|R
50|$|San Marin {{students}} {{are involved in}} a wide range of co-curricular and extra-curricular activities with many opportunities for parent involvement.

5|$|When an Iowa class {{battleship}} fired a Harpoon Missile, a <b>booster</b> propelled {{the missile}} {{away from the}} ship; after approximately , the <b>booster</b> dropped away. After the <b>booster</b> was discarded a turbojet engine ignited and propelled the missile to the target. The stabilizing and actuator fins, which helped to guide the missile to its target, were stored folded in the canister and sprang into position after launching. These fins directed the missile to the target through inputs from the AN/SWG-1 Harpoon Fire Control System.|$|E
5|$|Liquid Fly-back <b>Booster</b> (LFBB) was a German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) project {{concept to}} develop a {{reusable}} liquid rocket <b>booster</b> for Ariane 5 in order to significantly reduce a high cost of space transportation and increase environmental friendliness. LFBB would replace existing solid rocket boosters, providing main thrust during the liftoff. Once separated, two winged boosters would perform an atmospheric entry, fly back autonomously to the French Guiana, and land horizontally on the airport like an airplane.|$|E

50|$|For {{additional}} thrust during launch, the Delta II uses solid <b>boosters.</b> For the 6000-series, Delta II used Castor 4A <b>boosters,</b> {{while the}} 7000-series uses Graphite-Epoxy Motors manufactured by ATK. The vehicle can be flown with three, four, or, most commonly, nine <b>boosters.</b> When {{three or four}} <b>boosters</b> are used, all ignite {{on the ground at}} launch, while models using nine <b>boosters</b> would ignite six on the ground, then the remaining three in flight after the burnout and jettison of the first six.|$|R
5|$|Sealed Deck tournaments {{give each}} player six 15-card <b>booster</b> packs {{from which to}} build his or her deck.|$|E
5|$|The Atlas <b>booster</b> {{had been}} {{modified}} since the previous flight, and now included baffled fuel injectors {{and a new}} hypergolic fuel igniter instead of the original pyrotechnic igniter. This would completely eliminate problems with combustion instability and allow the <b>booster</b> to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held on the pad for a few moments. The factory testing and checkout process for MA-8's <b>booster,</b> while still a lengthy affair taking several months (partially due to the new propulsion system), was nonetheless easier and shorter {{than it had been}} for any previous Mercury-Atlas vehicle as engineers gained more experience with the hardware and coordination between contractors improved.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of cards {{are sold in}} <b>booster</b> packs, which contain fifteen cards normally divided into four rarities, which can be differentiated {{by the color of}} the expansion symbol. A fifteen-card <b>Booster</b> Pack will typically contain one rare (gold), three uncommons (silver), ten commons (black), and one basic land (colored black, as commons). Sets prior to Shards of Alara contained eleven commons instead of a basic land.|$|E
25|$|Tender <b>boosters</b> were {{equipped}} with side-rods connecting axles on the lead truck. Such small side-rods restricted speed and thus confined to switching locomotives, {{often used in}} transfer service between yards. Such <b>boosters</b> were far rarer than engine <b>boosters.</b>|$|R

5|$|Two <b>booster</b> {{tapes were}} {{released}} following {{the success of}} The Harbingers. The tapes provide a challenging experience to The Harbingers for experienced players. The <b>booster</b> tapes run for forty-five minutes instead of the sixty minutes of the original, and come with a new rule {{to limit the number}} of Keystones added to each province based on the number of players. Other than this limit the normal rules apply.|$|E
5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas <b>booster,</b> Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent <b>booster,</b> which was rotating slowly past, but made no attempt to move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing manual control of the spacecraft, which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.|$|E
50|$|Community {{support of}} the Grand Valley Local School District is strong. Parents and {{community}} members have provided active support of two P.T.O.s, Athletic <b>Boosters,</b> Band <b>Boosters,</b> Academic <b>Boosters,</b> Choir <b>Boosters</b> and Drama <b>Boosters,</b> as well as, individual school sponsored activities and programs such as their new Football Field improvements. The district boasts a P-12 244,000 sq. ft. facility which is situated on 94.6 acres completed in August 2005. A new football stadium and track facility complete with an eight lane weather track adjacent to the new school opened in August 2006.|$|R

5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (<b>booster)</b> to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the <b>booster</b> cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E
5|$|During the University of Michigan {{basketball}} scandal the Big Ten Conference, National Collegiate Athletic Association, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, and United States Department of Justice {{investigated the}} relationship between the University of Michigan, its men's basketball teams and basketball team <b>booster</b> Ed Martin. The program was punished for NCAA rules violations, principally involving payments <b>booster</b> Martin made to several players to launder money from an illegal gambling operation. It {{is one of the largest}} incidents involving payments to college athletes in American collegiate history. It was described as one of the three or four worst violations of NCAA bylaws in history up to that time by the NCAA infractions committee chairman and the largest athlete payment scandal ever by ESPN.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the flight {{dynamics}} of the cluster configuration of two first stage <b>boosters</b> and upper-stage, flight-testing of subsonic sub-scale models has been undertaken using two glideback <b>boosters</b> launched on a center upper-stage. Three high power rockets clustered together were built and flown to demonstrate vertical launch, separation and horizontal recovery of the <b>boosters.</b> Although the <b>boosters</b> fly to conventional aircraft landing, the centerstage comes down separately under its own parachute. The goal of the project has been to collect data during separation and flight for comparison with a six degree of freedom simulation. The configuration for the delta wing canard <b>boosters</b> comes from a design by Starcraft <b>Boosters,</b> Inc. The subscale rockets were constructed of foam covered in carbon or fiberglass and were launched with commercially available solid rocket motors. The first set of <b>boosters</b> built were 3 -ft tall with a 4 -ft tall centerstage, and two additional sets of <b>boosters</b> were made that were each over 5 -ft tall with a 7. 5 ft centerstage. The rocket cluster is launched vertically, then after motor bum out the <b>boosters</b> are separated and flown to a horizontal landing under radio-control. An on-board data acquisition system recorded data during both the launch and glide phases of flight...|$|R

5|$|The China National Space Administration offers NASA the Taiyang Shen, a {{classified}} <b>booster</b> rocket that {{can carry a}} payload to Mars. Meanwhile, JPL astrodynamicist Rich Purnell devises a trajectory to divert Hermes back to Mars for a rescue {{more than two years}} earlier, using the Chinese <b>booster</b> to resupply Hermes for an additional eighteen months. Sanders rejects the plan, refusing to risk the crew, but Henderson surreptitiously sends the details to Hermes. The crew unanimously vote for the plan, and NASA — powerless to stop them — resupplies Hermes as it uses Earth's gravity to slingshot back to Mars.|$|E
5|$|The University of Michigan {{basketball}} scandal or Ed Martin scandal was {{a series}} of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules violations that resulted in a six-year investigation {{of the relationship between the}} University of Michigan, its men's basketball program, and basketball team <b>booster</b> Ed Martin. As a result of the investigation, the Wolverine men's basketball program was punished with sanctions. The violations principally involved payments <b>booster</b> Martin made to several players to launder money from an illegal gambling operation.
