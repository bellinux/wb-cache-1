50|$|So, why did natural {{selection}} favour {{the development of}} these features, which are very important for active warm-blooded creatures, but of little apparent use to cold-blooded aquatic ambush predators that spend the vast majority of their time floating in water or lying on river banks?Paleontological evidence shows that the ancestors of living crocodilians were active and endothermic (warm-blooded). Some experts believe that their archosaur ancestors were warm-blooded as well. Physiological, anatomical, and developmental features of the crocodilian heart support the paleontological evidence and show that the lineage reverted to ectothermy when it invaded the aquatic, ambush predator niche. Crocodilian embryos develop fully 4-chambered hearts at an early stage. Modifications to the growing heart form a pulmonary <b>bypass</b> <b>shunt</b> that includes the left aortic arch, which originates from the right ventricle, the foramen of Panizza between the left and right aortic arches, and the cog‐tooth valve {{at the base of the}} pulmonary artery. The shunt is used during diving to make the heart function as 3-chambered heart, providing the crocodilian with the neurally controlled shunting used by ectotherms. The researchers concluded that the ancestors of living crocodilians had fully 4-chambered hearts, and were therefore warm-blooded, before they reverted to a cold-blooded or ectothermic metabolism. The authors also provide other evidence for endothermy in stem archosaurs. It is reasonable to suggest that later crocodilians developed the pulmonary <b>bypass</b> <b>shunt</b> as they became cold-blooded, aquatic, and less active.|$|E

Subsequently, we compare the I-V characteristic of the PV string under different faults scenarios, in order to identify the anomalies.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the patient who has had one {{operation}} for {{coarctation of the aorta}} and who then requires another because of a late complication at or near the coarctation site is a demanding one. The safety of aortic cross-clamping at the second operation depends on the adequacy or otherwise of the collateral circulation, and this in turn depends on {{the presence or absence of}} residual or recurrent aortic obstruction. Three illustrative cases are described in which there was complete, incomplete, and no aortic obstruction respectively at the time of reoperation, two of the cases presenting the additional complication of local aneurysm formation. The various aspects of management of such individuals are discussed, and the relevant literature has been reviewed in an attempt to provide a systematic approach to these difficult patients. The methods for assessing collateral circulation are both clinical and radiological with trial clamping of the aorta and pressure measurement as the most reliable ultimate test. A pressure of 50 mmHg in the distal aorta is accepted as indicating an adequate peripheral circulation, but it is recommended that the trial clamping should always include both the left subclavian artery and any particularly large local collaterals. The use of a perfusion technique to sustain the distal tissues is also recommended, although local <b>bypass</b> <b>shunts</b> have a place when their use is dictated in the interests of safety for the patient...|$|R

Therefore the present study was carried out to find out the variations in position and shape of the basilar artery using Magnetic Resonance Imaging and CT Angiography. MATHERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 130 consecutive patients, adults of both sexes, treated in UKC Tuzla.  Patients were divided into two groups.  In one group (100) were patients without aneurysm in the vertebrobasilar tree, and in the second group (30) patients with aneurysm. RESULTS: Three types of variations in the shape of basilar artery were recorded: those with arched course, S-shaped course, and the straight course type.  All the three types are approximately of the same percentage prevalence in the group of subjects without aneurysm in the vertebral-basilar tree, {{as well as in the}} group with aneurysm.  Basilar artery at 89. 33 % of respondents was located in medial or in paramedial position.

40|$|The {{functional}} and possible adaptive significance of non-avian reptiles' dual aortic arch {{system and the}} ability of all non-avian reptiles to perform central vascular cardiac shunts have been of great interest to comparative physiologists. The unique cardiac anatomy of crocodilians – a four-chambered heart with the dual aortic arch system – allows for only right-to-left (R–L; pulmonary <b>bypass)</b> cardiac <b>shunt</b> and for surgical elimination of this shunt. Surgical removal of the R–L shunt, by occluding the left aorta (LAo) upstream and downstream of the foramen of Panizza, results in a crocodilian with an obligatory, avian/mammalian central circulation. In this study, R–L cardiac shunt was eliminated in age-matched, female American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis; 5 – 7 months of age). We tested the hypothesis that surgical elimination of R–L cardiac shunt would impair growth (a readily measured proxy for fitness) compared with sham-operated, age-matched controls, especially in animals subjected to exhaustive exercise. While regular exercise caused a decrease in size (snout-to-vent length, head length and body mass), elimination of the capacity for R–L cardiac shunt did not greatly reduce animal growth, despite a chronic ventricular enlargement in surgically altered juvenile alligators. We speculate that, despite being slightly smaller, alligators with an occluded LAo would have reached sexual maturity in the same breeding season as control alligators. This study suggests that crocodilian R–L cardiac shunt does not provide an adaptive advantage for juvenile alligator growth and supports the logic that cardiac shunts persist in crocodilians because they have not been selected against...|$|R
