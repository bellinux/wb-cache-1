40|$|The prevalence, etiology, {{and proper}} {{management}} of acute gonadal inflammation in prepubertal children are still controversial, with some reports defining it as rare, while others have found it more prevalent. So far, {{there is no consensus}} on imaging studies or standard follow-up procedures. In the minority of the children, the inflammation is related to congenital genitourinary malformation and bacterial infection. The majority of children with gonadal inflammation are healthy and do not have any underlying malformations; in this group, the etiology is related to viral infection or torsion of the gonad appendix. Management is directed towards the etiology. Hence, when <b>bacterial</b> <b>inflammation</b> is suspected, antibiotics should be given and full evaluation of the urinary tract system should be performed. For patients with negative medical history, absence of fever, and normal urinalysis, the diagnosis of <b>bacterial</b> <b>inflammation</b> is very unlikely, and there is neither justification for antimicrobial antibiotic therapy nor for any further urinary tract imaging. Caution should be taken with nonverbal children and infants, or patients with any abnormal parameter. For these patients, we recommend initial management as for bacterial urinary tract infection, until urine cultures results are obtained.

40|$|Extracellular heat-shock {{proteins}} (eHsp) such {{as those}} belonging to the 70 -kDa family of Hsp (eg, Hsp 72) have been hypothesized {{to act as a}} “danger signal” to immune cells, promote immune responses, and improve host defense. The current study tested this hypothesis. Adult male F 344 rats were exposed to an acute laboratory stressor (100, 5 -second, 1. 6 -mA inescapable tail shocks) and challenged with Escherichia coli. The number of colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria at the site of injection, the levels of eHsp 72, the immune response to eHsp 72 and E coli–derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the amount of time required to recover from in vivo bacterial challenge were measured. CFUs were reduced 2, 4, and 6 hours after injection of E coli in rats exposed to stress. Rats exposed to stress had elevated eHsp 72 that was elevated rapidly (25 minutes) and remained elevated in the circulation and at the inflammatory site (2 hours after stressor termination). Both stressor exposure and eHsp 72 administration in the absence of stress resulted in a facilitated pattern of recovery after <b>bacterial</b> <b>inflammation</b> induced by subcutaneous E coli injection. Rats exposed to acute restraint (100 minutes) did not demonstrate elevated circulating eHsp 72 or a facilitated pattern of recovery after bacterial challenge. In vitro stimulation of rat splenocytes and macrophages with eHsp 72 elevated nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL) - 1 beta, and IL- 6, and this effect was specific to eHsp 72 because it was not diminished by polymyxin B and was reduced by earlier heat-denature treatment. Stimulation of cells with eHsp 72 combined with LPS resulted in a greater NO and cytokine response than that observed after stimulation with eHsp 72 or LPS alone. In vivo, at the inflammatory site, the bacterial-induced NO response was potentiated by stress, and NO inhibition (L-NIO) reduced the stress-induced facilitation but had no effect on the control kinetics of <b>bacterial</b> <b>inflammation</b> recovery. Thus, these results lend support to the hypothesis that intense stressor exposure increases eHsp 72, which acts as a danger signal to potentiate the NO response to bacterial challenge and facilitate recovery from <b>bacterial</b> <b>inflammation...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} {{hyaluronidase}} has been examined on the intensity of inflammations caused by various inflammatory agents, especially such as vaccinia viruses and pyogenic bacteria. It is already a well known fact that hyaluronidase has an enlarging action on the sites of <b>bacterial</b> <b>inflammations,</b> thus suppressing apparently the intensity of inflammation, while, on the contrary, it has an enhancing effect on viral inflammations. The {{results of the study}} showed one that this difference between <b>bacterial</b> and viral <b>inflammations</b> under the influence of hyaluronidase is possibly due to the difference of modes of infection between viruses and bacteria, and that hyaluronidase markedly increases the difference. To state the matter with more detail, hyaluronic acid contained in the stroma of the connective tissue is hydrolyzed by the enzymatic action of hyaluronidase, thus increasing the tissue permeability. This would cause the pathogenes in situ to be spread widely into the tissue. As, in the case of viral infection, viruses can be considered rapidly to reach the affined cells, then invasion into the cells and intracellular multiplication would probably be promoted, while in the case of bacterial infection, widely spread bacteria would easily be affected by phagocytes and antibodies. Thus, hyaluronidase seems to be more favourable to the existence of viruses in the tissue than to that of bacteria. As shown by this study with hyaluronidase, the stroma of the connective tissue {{plays an important role in}} various inflammations. Therefore, for the study of inflammation, not only cellular reactions and phagocytosis, but also the conditions of the connective tissue, especially of the stroma should be taken into consideration...|$|R

Acute <b>bacterial</b> <b>inflammation</b> is accompanied by excessive release of bacterial toxins and production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS), which ultimately results in redox stress.

Themechanisms employed byMSCs {{in order to survive}} these stress conditions are still poorly understood and require clarification. In this report, we demonstrated that in vitro treatment of MSCs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammatory responses, which included, but not limited to, upregulation of iNOS and release of RNS and ROS. These events triggered inMSCs a cascade of responses driving adaptive remodeling and resistance to a “self-inflicted ” oxidative stress.

40|$|This {{review is}} to {{evaluate}} the usefulness of acute phase proteins in monitoring transplant patients. Acute phase reaction is a non-specific immune response evoked by many different stimuli. Acute phase proteins (APPs) that {{play an important role}} in this reaction help to restore homeostasis. APPs concentration and glycosylation changes during acute and chronic inflammation are commonly known and they became a useful diagnostic tool to distinguish these two stages. They are very sensitive markers of inflammation though the reaction is not specific. The main problem in transplantology is to distinguish between the graft rejection and bacterial or viral inflammation. The best and non-invasive markers of rejection in contrast to <b>bacterial</b> <b>inflammation</b> that in many cases accompanies transplantation are still being searched. APPs that may be regarded as markers of alteration in the cytokine network allow to control the survival of transplants under the immunosuppressive therapy. They are also useful markers of early acute and chronic rejection and also of different posttransplant complications. The changes of APPs in serum of transplant patients are not organ specific, but their specificity becomes much better when correlated with other biochemical markers...|$|E

The induction of a cellular immune response is not only dependent on the engagement of the TCR but also requires co-stimulation. In order to study {{the role of the}} co-stimulatory molecule of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family member CD 27 during murine M. tuberculosis infection, we intranasally infected wild-type (WT) and CD 27 knockout (KO) mice with 10 (5) colony-forming units M. tuberculosis.
