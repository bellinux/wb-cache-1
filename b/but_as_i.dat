I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E

It depends on His grace whether He wishes to keep this prodigy of nature in this world in which He placed it or {{to take it to}} Himself.|$|E

500|$|For {{months after}} its passage, Lincoln did not {{publicly}} {{comment on the}} Kansas-Nebraska Act, but he came to strongly oppose it. On October 16, 1854, in his [...] "Peoria Speech", Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated {{en route to the}} presidency.

500|$|Fellini's {{creative}} process for La Strada started with vague feelings, [...] "a kind of tone", he said, [...] "that lurked, {{which made me}} melancholy {{and gave me a}} diffused sense of guilt, like a shadow hanging over me. This feeling suggested two people who stay together, although it will be fatal, and they don't know why". These feelings evolved into certain images: snow silently falling on the ocean, various compositions of clouds, and a singing nightingale. At that point, Fellini started to draw and sketch these images, a habitual tendency that he claimed he had learned early in his career when he had worked in various provincial music halls and had to sketch out the various characters and sets. Finally, he reported that the idea first [...] "became real" [...] to him when he drew a circle {{on a piece of paper}} to depict Gelsomina's head, and he decided to base the character on the actual character of Giulietta Masina, his wife of five years at the time: [...] "I utilized the real Giulietta, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> saw her. I was influenced by her childhood photographs, so elements of Gelsomina reflect a ten-year-old Giulietta." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{has been}} labeled by the French media as [...] "the female Zidane" [...] - like Zinedine Zidane, she has Algerian ancestry, {{grew up in}} Marseille and {{possesses}} immense skill, especially as a playmaker with an eye for goal. As such, she has been nicknamed [...] "Ziza", a variant of Zidane's [...] "Zizou". In an interview with FIFA.com just before the 2012 Olympics, she alluded to the comparison, saying, [...] "Zidane is {{a role model for}} me. He was always the player that I most enjoyed watching. The comparison was made frequently when I was starting out, and now, as the years pass, it happens less and less often. But I wouldn't say I’m tired of it." [...] She often attempts to downplay the comparison, though, stating [...] "Being compared to Zidane is really nice, but I don’t think it can harm me because I’ve been hearing it since I was very young. It always makes me proud, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> always say, I don’t think you can compare anyone to him. He’s unique". While training at the Clairefontaine academy in 2004, Nécib met Zidane, who was at the training center in preparation for qualifying for the 2006 World Cup (the finals would eventually be his last act as a professional). The two players exchanged shirts, and the shirt Nécib acquired from Zidane is currently in the possession of her father.|$|E

500|$|With three races {{remaining}} in the Championship and a fourteen-point advantage, Webber said he would continue his pursuit of the title; [...] "I need to keep racing hard and going for victories. Clearly, if my rivals have a rough weekend {{it makes it a}} bit harder for them and it gives me a bit more scope, but I'm not looking to abuse that because it can all go pear-shaped very fast." [...] Vettel said his season had been fraught with car problems but he remained positive about his chances; [...] "I think it's normal to have ups and downs – and sometimes you have more, sometimes less – <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> said, the expectation was probably {{to be in a position}} to fight for the championship and I think we're in a very strong and very good position." [...] Alonso urged his teammate Massa to help him in his title bid and said the Korean Grand Prix could become [...] "decisive" [...] for his championship rivals. He favoured Hamilton to win the Korean Grand Prix. With Hamilton twenty-eight points behind Webber and with Button a further three points behind his teammate, McLaren's team principal Martin Whitmarsh said his drivers would keep their focus in the season's remaining three races and produce consistent performances. Karun Chandhok, who raced for Hispania in the first ten races of the season, said Red Bull were the favourites to win, and that he thought the circuit's three long straights would suit the McLaren cars.|$|E
