Craig Venter Institute {{assembled}} a synthetic <b>bacterial</b> <b>genome,</b> Mycoplasma genitalium, by using recombination in yeast of 25 overlapping DNA fragments {{in a single}} step.

25|$|A set of multienzymes (peptide synthase CepA, CepB, and CepC) are {{responsible}} for assembling the heptapeptide. (Figure 2). The organization of CepA, CepB, and Cep C closely resembles other peptide synthases such as those for surfactin (SrfA1, SrfA2, and SrfA3) and gramicidin (GrsA and GrsB). Each peptide synthase activates codes for various amino acids to activate each domain. CepA codes for modules 1, 2, and 3. CepB codes for modules 4, 5, and 6, and CepC codes for module 7. The three peptide synthases are located {{at the start of}} the region of the <b>bacterial</b> <b>genome</b> linked with antibiotic biosynthesis, and span 27 kb.|$|E
25|$|A {{more recent}} method for genome editing uses CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) {{sequences}} and the endonuclease Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9). These components {{are an integral}} part of the immune response for some bacteria. and have been repurposed for genome engineering. In this system, sequences matching foreign bacteriophage or plasmid DNA are incorporated as “spacer” sequences into the <b>bacterial</b> <b>genome</b> located between repeating CRISPR loci. Cas endonucleases are able to initiate double strand breaks within these foreign DNAs that are complement to the transcribed CRISPR RNAs (crRNA, or “protospacers”), thus degrading them. A conserved protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM, sequence 5’-NGG-3’) located immediately downstream of the protospacer in the cellular genome is necessary for Cas9 cleavage. Together, this system allows for adaptive immunity to the dynamic viral genetic material.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes prophages {{may provide}} {{benefits}} to the host bacterium while they are dormant by adding new functions to the <b>bacterial</b> <b>genome</b> in a phenomenon called lysogenic conversion. Examples are the conversion of harmless strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae or Vibrio cholerae by [...] bacteriophages to highly virulent ones, which cause diphtheria or cholera, respectively. [...] Strategies to combat certain bacterial infections by targeting these toxin-encoding prophages have been proposed.|$|E
2500|$|Bacteriophages {{have played}} and {{continue}} to {{play a key role in}} bacterial genetics and molecular biology. Historically, they were used to define gene structure and gene regulation. Also the first genome to be sequenced was a bacteriophage. However, bacteriophage research did not lead the genomics revolution, which is clearly dominated by bacterial genomics. Only very recently has the study of bacteriophage genomes become prominent, thereby enabling researchers to understand the mechanisms underlying phage evolution. [...] Bacteriophage genome sequences can be obtained through direct sequencing of isolated bacteriophages, but can also be derived as part of microbial genomes. Analysis of bacterial genomes has shown that a substantial amount of microbial DNA consists of prophage sequences and prophage-like elements. A detailed database mining of these sequences offers insights into the role of prophages in shaping the <b>bacterial</b> <b>genome.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Several LSm {{proteins}} {{have been}} reported in the third domain of life, the Bacteria. [...] Hfq protein forms homohexamer rings, and was originally discovered as necessary for infection by the bacteriophage Qβ, although this is clearly not the native function of this protein in bacteria. [...] It is not universally present in all bacteria, but has been found in Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Spirochaetes, Thermotogae, Aquificae and one species of Archaea. [...] (This last instance is probably a case of horizontal gene transfer.) [...] Hfq is pleiotropic with a variety of interactions, generally associated with translation regulation. [...] These include blocking ribosome binding to mRNA, marking mRNA for degradation by binding to their poly-A tails, and association with bacterial small regulatory RNAs (such as DsrA RNA) that control translation by binding to certain mRNAs. A second bacterial LSm protein is YlxS (sometimes also called YhbC), which was first identified in the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. [...] This is a two-domain protein with a N-terminal LSm domain. [...] Its function is unknown, but amino acid sequence homologs are found in virtually every <b>bacterial</b> <b>genome</b> to date, and it may be an essential protein. The middle domain of the small conductance mechanosensitive channel MscS in Escherichia coli forms a homoheptameric ring. This LSm domain has no apparent RNA-binding function, but the homoheptameric torus is part of the central channel of this membrane protein.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Chromosomal {{replication}} is {{the central}} event in the bacterial cell cycle. Identification of replication origins (oriC s) is necessary for almost all newly sequenced <b>bacterial</b> <b>genomes.</b> Given the increasing pace of genome sequencing, the current available software for predicting oriC s, however, still leaves much to be desired. Therefore, the increasing availability of genome sequences calls for improved software to identify oriC s in newly sequenced and unannotated <b>bacterial</b> <b>genomes.</b> Results We have developed Ori-Finder, an online system for finding oriC s in <b>bacterial</b> <b>genomes</b> based on an integrated method comprising the analysis of base composition asymmetry using the Z -curve method, distribution of DnaA boxes, and the occurrence of genes frequently close to oriC s. The program can also deal with unannotated genome sequences by integrating the gene-finding program ZCURVE 1. 02. Output of the predicted results is exported to an HTML report, which offers convenient views on the results in both graphical and tabular formats. Conclusion A web-based system to predict replication origins of <b>bacterial</b> <b>genomes</b> has been presented here. Based on this system, oriC regions have been predicted for the <b>bacterial</b> <b>genomes</b> available in GenBank currently. It is hoped that Ori-Finder will become {{a useful tool for}} the identification and analysis of oriC s in both <b>bacterial</b> and archaeal <b>genomes.</b> </p...|$|R

5000|$|Molecular phylogenetics has {{revealed}} that every clade of bacteria with genome sizes under 2 Mb was derived from ancestors with much larger genomes, thus refuting the hypothesis that bacteria evolved by the successive doubling of small-genomed ancestors. Recent studies performed by Nilsson et al. examined the rates of <b>bacterial</b> <b>genome</b> reduction of obligate bacteria. Bacteria were cultured introducing frequent bottlenecks and growing cells in serial passage to reduce gene transfer so as to mimic conditions of endosymbiotic bacteria. The data predicted that bacteria exhibiting a one-day generation time lose as many as 1,000 kbp in as few as 50,000 years (a relatively short evolutionary time period). Furthermore, after deleting genes essential to the methyl-directed DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, it was shown that <b>bacterial</b> <b>genome</b> size reduction increased in rate {{by as much as}} 50 times. [...] These results indicate that genome size reduction can occur relatively rapidly, and loss of certain genes can speed up the process of <b>bacterial</b> <b>genome</b> compaction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background An {{increasing}} number of whole viral and <b>bacterial</b> <b>genomes</b> are being sequenced and deposited in public databases. In parallel to the mounting interest in whole genomes, the number of whole genome analyses software tools is also increasing. GeneOrder was originally developed to provide an analysis of genes between two genomes, allowing visualization of gene order and synteny comparisons of any small genomes. It was originally developed for comparing virus, mitochondrion and chloroplast genomes. This is now extended to small <b>bacterial</b> <b>genomes</b> of sizes less than 2 Mb. Results GeneOrder 3. 0 has been developed and validated successfully on several small <b>bacterial</b> <b>genomes</b> (ca. 580 kb to 1. 83 Mb) archived in the NCBI GenBank database. It is an updated web-based "on-the-fly" computational tool allowing gene order and synteny comparisons of any two small <b>bacterial</b> <b>genomes.</b> Analyses of several <b>bacterial</b> <b>genomes</b> show that {{a large amount of}} gene and genome re-arrangement occurs, as seen with earlier DNA software tools. This can be displayed at the protein level using GeneOrder 3. 0. Whole genome alignments of genes are presented in both a table and a dot plot.

Thereafter, data mining in the complete sequence is an essential step. New in silico methods are needed that rapidly identify the major features of genome organization and facilitate the prediction of the functional class of ORFs. We tested the usefulness of local oligonucleotide usage (OU) patterns to recognize and differentiate types of atypical oligonucleotide composition in DNA sequences of <b>bacterial</b> <b>genomes.</b> Results A total of 163 <b>bacterial</b> <b>genomes</b> of eubacteria and archaea published in the NCBI database were analyzed. Local OU patterns exhibit substantial intrachromosomal variation in bacteria. Loci with alternative OU patterns were parts of horizontally acquired gene islands or ancient regions such as genes for ribosomal proteins and RNAs.
