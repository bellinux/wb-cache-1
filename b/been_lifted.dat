5|$|At 09:45, the US Embassy closed. There {{would be}} no {{diplomatic}} relations between the US and Cambodia again until 11 November 1991. By 10:41 all the evacuees including Ambassador Dean and President Saukham Khoy had <b>been</b> <b>lifted</b> out by helicopters of HMH-462. Helicopters of HMH-463 operating from the USS Hancock then began to land to extract the ground security force.|$|E

This legislation assures that the tragedy of Rosewood will never be forgotten by the generations to come.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the {{political}} climate was changing and the ban on forming veterans' associations had <b>been</b> <b>lifted.</b> Encouraged by the shifting tone of the World War II discourse and the courting of the Wehrmacht veterans by the West German government and political parties, former Waffen-SS members came forward to campaign for their rights.|$|E

5|$|Belarus was a {{founding}} member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Belarus has trade agreements with several European Union member states (despite other member states' travel ban on Lukashenko and top officials), including neighboring Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Travel bans imposed by the European Union have <b>been</b> <b>lifted</b> in the past in order to allow Lukashenko to attend diplomatic meetings and also to engage his government and opposition groups in dialogue.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate was {{considering}} {{whether or not}} to prosecute WCRC. The ORR also has powers to prosecute; they subsequently decided to prosecute both WCRS and the driver of the train. Although the suspension had <b>been</b> <b>lifted</b> by NR, the ORR could still have revoked WCRC's Safety Certificate {{at the end of the}} 28-day consultation period. The lifting of the suspension by NR was subject to a review after three months.|$|E
50|$|After Lifter {{arrived at}} the Bay Area in March 2009, {{it was used to}} place pre-fabricated {{falsework}} truss sections and the 28 box girder deck sections. Before the heavy deck sections for the Bay Bridge <b>were</b> <b>lifted,</b> the Left Coast Lifter raised a sunken tugboat in August 2009, USS Wenonah. The first deck section <b>was</b> <b>lifted</b> in February 2010, and the last deck section <b>was</b> <b>lifted</b> in October 2011.|$|R

50|$|There is {{evidence}} that meltwater discharges are episodic. This can result because as water continues to collect, more ice <b>is</b> <b>lifted,</b> and the water moves outward in a growing under-ice lake. Areas where the ice <b>is</b> most easily <b>lifted</b> (i.e., areas with thinner overlying ice sheets) <b>are</b> <b>lifted</b> first. Hence the water may move up the terrain underlying the glacier if it moves toward areas of lower overlying ice. As water collects, additional ice <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> until a release path is created.|$|R
5|$|On 12 March, news of Victor's {{defeat at}} the Battle of Barrosa reached Soult {{and he left}} Badajoz to return to Andalusia, anxious that the siege of Cádiz had <b>been</b> <b>lifted.</b> Reaching Seville on 20 March he was {{relieved}} to find that Victor's siege lines still held and Andalusia remained under French control. Before his departure Soult had consolidated his gains in Extremadura by garrisoning Badajoz with 11,000 French troops {{under the command of}} Marshal Édouard Mortier.|$|E
5|$|The Sardinian cheese casu marzu {{is exposed}} to flies known as cheese skippers such as Piophila casei, {{members of the family}} Piophilidae. The {{digestive}} activities of the fly larvae soften the cheese and modify the aroma as {{part of the process of}} maturation. At one time European Union authorities banned sale of the cheese and it was becoming hard to find, but the ban has <b>been</b> <b>lifted</b> on the grounds that the cheese is a traditional local product made by traditional methods.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the German fleet had arrived, the siege of Peking had already <b>been</b> <b>lifted</b> by forces from {{other members of the}} Eight-Nation Alliance that had formed to deal with the Boxers. Nevertheless, Brandenburg took up patrol duties in the area {{surrounding}} the mouth of the Yangtze River, and in October participated in the occupations of the coastal fortifications protecting the cities of Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao before returning to the Yangtze. Since the situation had calmed, the four battleships were sent to Hong Kong or Nagasaki, Japan, in late 1900 and early 1901 for overhauls; Brandenburg went to Hong Kong for her overhaul in January and February 1901. After the work was completed, she steamed to Tsingtao in the German Kiautschou Bay concession, where she took part in training exercises {{with the rest of the}} expeditionary force.|$|E

50|$|If meltwater accumulates, the {{discharges}} are episodic under continental ice sheets as well {{as under}} Alpine glaciers. The discharge results when water collects, the overlying ice <b>is</b> <b>lifted,</b> and the water moves outward in a pressurized layer or a growing under-ice lake. Areas where the ice <b>is</b> most easily <b>lifted</b> (i.e. areas with thinner overlying ice sheets) <b>are</b> <b>lifted</b> first. Hence the water may move up the terrain underlying the glacier if it moves toward areas of lower overlying ice.

5|$|By {{the time}} the German fleet had arrived, the siege of Peking had already <b>been</b> <b>lifted</b> by forces from {{other members of the}} Eight-Nation Alliance that had formed to deal with the Boxers. Wörth left Taku to coal at Tsingtau, the German naval base in China, and on 25 October {{returned}} to Wusong via Yantai. There, she joined the blockade of the Yangtze River. Since the situation had calmed, the four battleships were sent to Hong Kong or Nagasaki, Japan, in late 1900 and early 1901 for overhauls; Wörth went to Nagasaki from 30 November to the end of December. She returned to Wusong on 27 December, where she remained until 18 February 1901, when she moved to Tsingtau for division exercises and gunnery drills. Wörth {{and the rest of the}} fleet then stayed in Shanghai in April and May.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, a new diesel {{shunting}} locomotive, made by Thomas Hill of Rotherham was purchased. It {{was built}} at Kilnhurst, and driven along the ex-Great Central Railway line {{from there to}} the works. The first Ruston and Hornsby engine was partially dismantled, and eventually cut up in January 1978. The connection between the works and the British Rail network was cut in 1984, and the system became one of {{a very small number of}} isolated standard gauge railways. By 1986, the track layout had been simplified, and the track across Jordan bridge had <b>been</b> <b>lifted.</b> When rail operation ceased in the 1990s, one of the Hudson tipping wagons went to the National Railway Museum at Shildon, and the Thomas Hill engine, after several changes of ownership, is now located on the Peak Rail preserved railway at Matlock.|$|E
5|$|The club {{built on}} the success of the {{previous}} season and for a while challenged for the league title. However Palace fell just short of champions Arsenal and runners-up Liverpool, finishing a club-best third in the league. Palace were denied a place in Europe because although the ban on English clubs in European competitions following the Heysel disaster of 1985 had now <b>been</b> <b>lifted,</b> there would only be one place for English clubs in the 1991–92 edition of the UEFA Cup, and this went to Liverpool rather than Palace. Success was achieved that season however when Palace made their third trip to Wembley in twelve months, beating Everton 4–1 in the final of the Full Members Cup.|$|E

5|$|While the {{election}} was being scheduled, the PPP completed five-year election term in March 2013, so the government {{was replaced by a}} caretaker prime minister and cabinet, in which Khar was not a member, until {{the election}} took place. This ended Khar's two year role as Foreign Minister. In April 2013, Khar announced that she was standing down at the next general election, so that her father, who had previously been ineligible to stand as a candidate, could succeed her. The condition requiring parliamentary candidates to hold a university degree, which had led to Khar replacing her father in 2002, had <b>been</b> <b>lifted</b> since the most recent general election. The PPP came second in the election, losing 74 seats; Khar's father was defeated in his bid to regain his former seat.|$|E
5|$|After the Duke of Northumberland's {{attainder}} {{the entire}} Dudley inheritance had disappeared. His sons {{had to start}} from scratch in rebuilding the family fortunes, as they had renounced any rights to their father's former possessions or titles when their own attainders had <b>been</b> <b>lifted</b> in January 1558. Robert Dudley financed the lifestyle expected of a royal favourite by large loans from City of London merchants until in April 1560 Elizabeth granted him his first export licence, worth £6,000 p.a. He also received some of his father's lands, but since he was not the family heir {{it was a matter of}} some difficulty to find a suitable estate for his intended peerage. In June 1563 the Queen granted him Kenilworth Manor, Castle, and Park, together with the lordships of Denbigh and Chirk in North Wales. Other grants were to follow. Eventually, Leicester and his elder brother Ambrose, Earl of Warwick, came to preside over the greatest aristocratic interest in the West Midlands and North Wales.|$|E
5|$|In {{their book}} The Fantastic 1804 Dollar, numismatic historians Eric P. Newman and Kenneth E. Bressett assert {{that a problem}} arose at the Mint {{as to how to}} {{interpret}} Forsyth's order. As his initial correspondence indicated that the sets were to include coins of every type then in use, Mint officials included both the silver dollar and gold eagle. The moratorium on silver dollar coinage had <b>been</b> <b>lifted</b> in 1831, but none had been coined since those issued in March 1804. Two sets of coins, minted in proof finish, were completed and delivered along with their boxes to Roberts shortly prior to his departure on the USS Peacock on April 27, 1835. The dollars included the sets bore the Draped Bust design, depicting an allegorical representation of Liberty on the obverse and a heraldic eagle on the reverse. A list of diplomatic gifts was also proposed for missions to Japan and Cochin-China (today part of Vietnam), which included two additional sets of coins.|$|E

5|$|On 1 May an {{even larger}} operation, known by the ARVN as Operation Toan Thang 43 and by MACV as Operation Rockcrusher, got {{underway}} as 36 B-52s dropped 774 tons of bombs along {{the southern edge of}} the Fishhook. This was followed by an hour of massed artillery fire and another hour of strikes by tactical fighter-bombers. At 10:00, the 1st Air Cav Division, the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, the 1st ARVN Armoured Cavalry Regiment, and the 3rd ARVN Airborne Brigade then entered Kampong Cham Province of Cambodia. Known as Task Force Shoemaker (after General Robert M. Shoemaker, the Assistant Division Commander of the 1st Cavalry Division), the force attacked the long-time communist stronghold with 10,000 U.S. and 5,000 South Vietnamese troops. The operation utilized mechanized infantry and armored units to drive deep into the province where they would then link up with ARVN airborne and U.S. airmobile units that had <b>been</b> <b>lifted</b> in by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Parsifal {{tells of}} his desire to return to Amfortas (""). He relates his long journey, how he wandered for years, {{unable to find a}} path back to the Grail. He had often been forced to fight, but never wielded the Spear in battle. Gurnemanz tells him that the curse {{preventing}} Parsifal from finding his right path has now <b>been</b> <b>lifted,</b> but that in his absence Amfortas has never unveiled the Grail, and lack of its sustaining properties has caused the death of Titurel. Parsifal is overcome with remorse, blaming himself for this state of affairs. Gurnemanz tells him that today is the day of Titurel's funeral, and that Parsifal has a great duty to perform. Kundry washes Parsifal's feet and Gurnemanz anoints him with water from the Holy Spring, recognizing him as the pure fool, now enlightened by compassion, and as the new King of the Knights of the Grail.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{lasted until}} 15 April, with mines—including many M16s that had <b>been</b> <b>lifted</b> by the Viet Cong from the controversial barrier minefield laid by the Australians at Dat Do—once again claiming a significant toll. Ten Australians {{were killed and}} another 36 were wounded, while known Viet Cong casualties included 21 killed, 14 wounded and 40 captured. Fifty-seven camps and bunker systems were also destroyed, as were large quantities of weapons, munitions and supplies. Judged a success by the Australians despite their heavy losses, the operation had resulted in significant disruption to the Viet Cong and hindered their operations for some time. Regardless, with 1 ATF lacking the manpower to hold the area, the failure of South Vietnamese forces to permanently occupy the Long Hais meant that any gains were only fleeting, and the D445 Battalion headquarters soon returned to the area after ejecting a South Vietnamese regional force company a few months later. Meanwhile, 7 RAR had finished its last operation in March and was relieved by 1 RAR on 9 April, returning to Australia having completed its twelve-month tour.|$|E
