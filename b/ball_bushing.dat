40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the subject matter}} of steel mill product analysis using quality tools. The subject of quality control were bolts and a <b>ball</b> <b>bushing.</b> The Pareto chart and fault mode and effect analysis (FMEA) were used to assess faultiness of the products. The faultiness analysis in case of the bolt enabled us to detect the following defects: failure to keep the dimensional tolerance, dents and imprints, improper roughness, lack of pre-machining, non-compatibility of the electroplating and faults on the surface. Analysis of the <b>ball</b> <b>bushing</b> has also revealed defects such as: failure to keep the dimensional tolerance, dents and imprints, improper surface roughness, lack of surface premachining as well as sharp edges and splitting of the material...|$|E

50|$|Indianapolis {{responded with}} a drive to the New Orleans 33-yard line, only to have Stover miss a 51-yard field goal attempt, giving the ball back to the Saints with good field {{position}} on their 41-yard line. After that, Brees led the Saints on another touchdown drive featuring seven different players getting the <b>ball.</b> <b>Bush</b> started off the drive with a 12-yard run, and then Devery Henderson caught a pass on the Colts' 36-yard line. Following an 8-yard catch and run by Bush, Brees completed passes to Colston, Robert Meachem and tight end David Thomas, moving {{the ball to the}} 5-yard line. After a 3-yard run by Pierre Thomas, Brees threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey. Rather than settle for a six-point lead, and risk a potential Colts game-winning touchdown, the Saints chanced a two-point conversion. Lance Moore received a pass and attempted to stretch the ball out over the goal line as he fell to the ground and rolled over on his head. The ball was kicked away from his hands by defender Jacob Lacey, and the play was ruled an incomplete pass, prompting a coach's challenge from Sean Payton. After the review, the ruling on the field was overturned when it was determined that Moore maintained possession of the ball long enough and the ball had crossed the plane of the goal line for a successful conversion, giving the Saints a 24-17 advantage.|$|R

40|$|The Lower Control arm is {{the most}} vital {{component}} in a suspension system. It is usually a steel bracket that pivots on rubber bushings mounted to the chassis.

Significant amount of loads are transmitted through the control arm while it serves to maintain the contact between the wheel and the road and thus providing precise control of the vehicle. The finite element analysis of the control arm using NEiNASTRAN is presented. Inertia relief analysis was carried out as the measured road loads were in self equilibrium. The zone of maximum stress {{in most of the}} load cases studied is close to the left strut bush and around the lower <b>ball</b> joint <b>bush.</b> Since the stresses exceed the material yield strength, a nonlinear static analysis of the control arm was also carried out using NEiNASTRAN and the results are compared well with MSC.

However, replays show that Aguilar jumped in front of the <b>ball</b> as <b>Bush</b> was kicking it away. Aguilar then punched Bush in the face, which went unnoticed by the referee. This yellow card suspended him for the second leg in Montreal. Bush showed his frustration for the call after the match, saying “After every goal I give up, I kick the ball towards midfield. Every single goal. The fact is that I had the ball in my hands, I kicked it towards midfield and he comes and blocks the ball. Then he hits me in the face.” As a result, Bush missed the second leg of the final, which Montreal lost 4-2 and 5-3 on aggregate.|$|R

40|$|Control Arm (CA) of a {{suspension}} {{plays an important}} role in the automotive ride comfort and handling stability. In this paper, the topology optimization model including <b>ball</b> joints and <b>bushing</b> for topology optimization of an aluminium CA is established, where a ball joint is simplified as rigid elements and the elastic properties of a rubber bushing are estimated using Mooney-Rivlin constitutive law. A method for treating with multiple loads in topology optimization of CA is presented. Inertia relief theory is employed in the FEA model of the CA in order to simulate the large displacement motion characteristics of the CA. A CA is designed based on the topology optimization results, and the strength, natural frequency, and rigidity of the optimized CA are calculated. The calculated results show that the performances of the optimized CA with the proposed model meet the predetermined requirements...|$|R

In the NFC Championship that season against the Green Bay Packers, Johnson made a {{critically}} important play late in the 4th quarter: Fellow Giant R.W. McQuarters fumbled a punt return, and as Packer Jarrett Bush wrapped his hands around the ball to recover it, Johnson dove in and punched the <b>ball</b> out of <b>Bush's</b> hands. The fumble was eventually recovered by fellow Giant Domenik Hixon, and {{they went on to}} win the game in overtime. In 2008, Johnson switched to number 20.

Atlanta would make a run and wear down the Saints defense when Michael Jenkins caught a 50-yard touchdown pass from Chris Redman to move within a touchdown. Jason Snelling would add a 4-yard touchdown run {{to tie the game}} at 23. Late in the fourth quarter, the Saints would {{have a chance to get}} the lead back with a Garrett Hartley 38-yard field goal. The Saints got a break when Jonathan Vilma intercepted a Chris Redman pass to give the Saints a chance to increase the lead. The Saints would move the ball but only settle for a fake field goal that failed. The results continued in doubt for the Saints until Vilma came up with another defensive fourth-down hit on RB Jason Snelling. Stopping him a yard short of the marker with just over a minute remaining, the Saints' defense came up big but gave up 392 yards. Drew Brees threw for 296 yards for the season and threw for more than 30,000 yards in his career.He also added three touchdowns for the season and tied a club record with 120 in his Saints career.
