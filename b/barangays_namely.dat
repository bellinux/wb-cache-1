40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} relationship between land tenure security and disaster resilience. The core concept {{of this research is}} the integration between the two major themes of tenure security and disaster resilience. Two case studies that fit the research context were selected, <b>namely</b> <b>Barangays</b> of Ilawod and Tagaytay in Camalig Municipality, Province of Albay, the Philippines. The two barangays are prone to multiple disasters, i. e. typhoon, flash floods, river flood, lahar/mudflow, lava/pyroclastic flow, ash flow, earthquake and landslide. At the same time, only 37 % of the total lots in the study area are titled or registered. This thesis presents the results of qualitative methods using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with local communities and related stakeholders. It was found that land titles are not the main instrument in securing land tenure in the study area. In the absence of title documents, the level of confidence gained through security of occupation is the main aspect that builds their perception of tenure security. There are two sources of tenure security that are respected by the local communities and the government: de jure and de facto tenure security. Communities with legal title documents and residents of government-assisted housing enjoy the benefit of de jure tenure security since their occupation can be proved by legal title documents or formal certificate housing award issued by the government. On the other hand, this research confirms that even among communities living as informal settlers and tenants, de facto tenure security through community and government recognition, is almost as important as de jure or legal recognition in determining tenure security in the study area. Among the four dimensions of resilience (institutional, economic, social and physical) discussed in this research, social resilience is the strongest dimension in the study area that builds community’s perceptions on disaster resilience. Social resilience is built by strong social cohesion and a sense of community, trust among the community, and community involvement and respect to existing cultures and values. In addition, the strong capacity of local government in disaster management and perception of local communities of ‘natural disasters as part of life’ are other key factors that constitute community resilience. The research confirms that perceived tenure security can provide opportunities for Disaster Risk Reduction and promote disaster resilience. In a pre-disaster setting, it provides access to housing and livelihood, which are pre-conditions for economic growth. In a post-disaster setting, tenure security impacts early recovery and reconstruction process. Confidence to return to land and housing provides a shorter recovery time and rehabilitation process. This research has demonstrated that social aspects of the society bring the bridge between tenure security and resilience. Aspects such as a strong sense of community and social trust play important roles in securing tenure and provide a platform for building resilience. In these situations where economic vulnerability persists, this research demonstrates the importance of having strong community cohesion and social bonds in securing tenure and building resilience...|$|R
