5|$|Due to {{creative}} differences, Kuntz {{backed out of}} the project, but created an adventure module that would be published {{at the same time as}} Gygax's first book. Gygax continued to painstakingly put Castle Zagyg together on his own, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>this</b> slow and laborious process came to a complete halt when Gygax suffered a serious stroke in April 2004 and then another one a few weeks later. Although he returned to his keyboard after a seven-month convalescence, his output was reduced from 14-hour work days to only one or two hours per day. Finally in 2005, Castle Zagyg Part I: Yggsburgh, the first book in the six-book series, appeared. Later that year, Troll Lord Games also published Castle Zagyg: Dark Chateau (2005), the adventure module written for the Yggsburgh setting by Rob Kuntz. Jeff Talanian helped with the creation of the dungeon, eventually resulting in publication of the limited edition CZ9: The East Marks Gazetteer (2007).|$|E
5|$|The {{decline in}} the {{erection}} of stelae {{is linked to the}} {{decline in the}} institution of divine kingship, which began in the Late Preclassic. Originally the stelae depicted the king with symbols of power, sometimes standing over defeated enemies and occasionally accompanied by his wives or his heir. By the Terminal Classic, kings were sharing stelae with subordinate lords, who also played a prominent role in the events depicted. This reflected a decentralisation of power and the bargaining between high-ranking nobles so that the king could maintain power, but led to a progressive weakening of the king's rule. As the position of the king became weaker and that of his vassals and subordinates became stronger, the latter began to erect their own stelae, a function that was formerly the exclusive preserve of the king himself. Some of these subordinates broke away to form their own petty states, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>this</b> did not last and they also ceased to erect monuments.|$|E
25|$|According to U.S. {{government}} data , 46% of Massachusetts land {{is devoted}} to forest. Another 7% is rural parkland, which is also mainly forested. Urban and suburban development takes up 36% of the state’s land, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>this</b> land, outside of the main urban centers, consists largely of houses on wooded properties. About 4% of the state’s land is cropland, and less than 1% is pasture. About 2% of the state’s land is marsh or other wetland. The remainder {{of the land is}} taken up with other uses, such as transportation.|$|E

The reason for these rejections was more political than technical, but the Navy's demands for secrecy were certainly important. They repeated that the design would be released only if the British could demonstrate the basic concept was common knowledge, and therefore not a concern if it fell into German hands. The British failed to convince them, even after offering to equip their examples {{with a variety of}} self-destruct devices.|$|E
25|$|Because Taihōs hangars were {{completely}} enclosed, mechanical ventilation {{was the only}} means of exhausting fouled air and replacing it with fresh. Ventilation duct gates were opened on either side of hangar sections No. 1 and No. 2 and, for a time, the carrier's aft elevator was lowered to try to increase the draught. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>this</b> failed to have any appreciable effect and, in any case, air operations were resumed about noon, requiring the elevator to be periodically raised as aircraft were brought up to the flight deck. In desperation, damage control parties used hammers to smash out the glass in the ship's portholes.|$|E
25|$|The Métro {{is mostly}} {{underground}} (197km of 214km). Above-ground sections consist of viaducts within Paris (on lines 1, 2, 5 & 6) and the suburban ends of lines 1, 5, 8, and 13. The tunnels are relatively {{close to the}} surface due to the variable nature of the terrain, which complicates deep digging; exceptions include parts of line 12 under the hill of Montmartre and line 2 under Ménilmontant. The tunnels follow the twisting lie of the streets. During construction in 1900 a minimum radius of curvature of just 75 metres was imposed, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>this</b> low standard was not adhered to at Bastille and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette.|$|E

25|$|The year 2001 heralded {{major changes}} for Fiorentina, as the terrible {{state of the}} club's {{finances}} was revealed: {{they were unable to}} pay wages and had debts of around US$50 million. The club's owner, Vittorio Cecchi Gori, was able to raise some more money, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>this</b> soon proved to be insufficient resources to sustain the club. Fiorentina were relegated {{at the end of the}} 2001–02 season and went into judicially-controlled administration in June 2002. This form of bankruptcy (sports companies cannot exactly fail in this way in Italy, but they can suffer a similar procedure) meant that the club was refused a place in Serie B for the 2002–03 season, and as a result effectively ceased to exist.|$|E
25|$|The Mendocino cypress differs {{little from}} C. goveniana in morphology, {{with the most}} {{conspicuous}} difference in herbarium material being the usually glossy black seeds, unlike the dull brown seeds of C. goveniana, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>this</b> character is not constant, with dull brown seeds found in the southernmost populations of C. pigmaea near Point Arena. Preliminary genetic studies have shown some differences, with notably some plastid sequences (matK, rbcL, and trnL) suggesting a possible closer relationship to C. macrocarpa, though other sequences confirm its close relationship to C. goveniana. In cultivation together with C. goveniana, it retains a very different crown shape, with a tall slender crown, contrasting with the broad, shrubby crown of C. goveniana; it also has darker green foliage (paler, yellow-green in C. goveniana).|$|E
25|$|He {{scored on}} the final day of the season against Wimbledon – it was his only senior goal of that campaign. By that game United were Premiership champions and Robson finally won the league {{championship}} medal that he had been trying to gain since his days at West Bromwich Albion some 15 years earlier. It was not just injuries that were restricting the 36-year-old Robson's first-team chances. Eric Cantona had been signed during the 1992–93 campaign and played up front with Mark Hughes, while Hughes's former strike-partner Brian McClair had been converted into a midfielder. This counted against Robson and the biggest blow came in the summer of 1993 when United signed Nottingham Forest's Roy Keane, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>this</b> did not quite signal the end for Bryan Robson at Manchester United.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half, Seattle {{finally got a}} scoring {{opportunity}} when Hawkins fumbled {{the ball on the}} first play from scrimmage and the Seahawks recovered. However, all they got from this was Krieg's third interception, this one to linebacker Matt Millen on the first play after the fumble. At this point, Krieg was benched and replaced by backup Jim Zorn. Meanwhile, LA drove to the Seahawks 9-yard line. Defensive back Gregg Johnson intercepted a pass from Plunkett in the end zone to keep his team in the game, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>this</b> turned out to be insufficient. Just two plays later, Davis recorded his second interception of the day, this one on the Seattle 46. On the next play, Allen took off for a 43-yard burst, and then caught a 3-yard touchdown pass to make the score 27–0.|$|E
25|$|Eustis {{had sent}} his first letter of 18 June by special messenger.

On 28 June, the postmaster at Cleveland, Ohio hired an express rider to rush the letter to Hull <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>this</b> arrived only on 2 July. The British ambassador in Washington had sent {{the news of the}} American declaration of war urgently to Britain and Canada and the military commanders in Canada had in turn hastened to inform all their outposts of the state of war. On 2 July, the unsuspecting Cayahoga was captured by a Canadian-manned armed brig of the Provincial Marine, General Hunter, near the British post at Amherstburg {{at the foot of the}} Detroit River.|$|E
25|$|The metro {{is mostly}} underground; surface {{sections}} include sections on viaduct in Paris (lines 1, 2, 5 and 6) {{and at the}} surface in the suburbs (lines 1, 5, 8 and 13). In most cases both tracks are laid in a single tunnel. Almost all lines follow roads, having been built by the cut-and-cover method near the surface (the earliest by hand). Line 1 follows the straight course of the Champs-Elysées and on other lines some stations (for example, Commerce) have platforms that do not align: the street above is too narrow to fit both platforms opposite each other. Many lines have very sharp curves. The specifications established in 1900 required a very low minimum curve radius by railway standards, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>this</b> was often not fully respected, for example near Bastille and Notre Dame de Lorette. Parts of the network are built at depth, in particular a section of line 12 under Montmartre, the sections under the Seine, and all of line 14.|$|E
60|$|In these {{operations}} the British captured 148 guns, with {{large quantities of}} stores. At Fort Edward General Schuyler was joined by General St. Clair, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> with <b>this</b> addition the total American strength did not exceed forty-four hundred.|$|R

25|$|For {{bands that}} include a front {{ensemble}} (also known as the pit or auxiliary percussion), stationary instrumentation may include orchestral percussion such as timpani, tambourines, maracas, cowbells, congas, wood blocks, marimbas, xylophones, bongos, vibraphones, timbales, claves, guiros, and chimes or tubular bells, concert bass drums, and gongs, {{as well as a}} multitude of auxiliary percussion equipment. Drum sets, purpose-built drum racks, and other mounted instruments are also placed here. Until the advent of the pit in the early 1980s, many of these instruments were actually carried on the field by marching percussionists by hand or on mounting brackets. Some bands also include electronic instruments such as synthesizers, electric guitars, and bass guitar, along with the requisite amplification. If double-reed or string instruments are used, they are usually placed here, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>this</b> usage is very rare due to their relative fragility. Unusual percussive instruments are sometimes used, including brake drums, empty propane tanks, trashcans, railroad ties, stomping rigs, and other interesting sounds.|$|E
25|$|Houseplants {{together}} with the medium {{in which they are}} grown can reduce components of indoor air pollution, particularly volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as benzene, toluene, and xylene. Plants remove CO2 and release oxygen and water, although the quantitative impact for house plants is small. Most of the effect is attributed to the growing medium alone, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>this</b> effect has finite limits associated with the type and quantity of medium and the flow of air through the medium. The effect of house plants on VOC concentrations was investigated in one study, done in a static chamber, by NASA for possible use in space colonies. The results showed that the removal of the challenge chemicals was roughly equivalent to that provided by the ventilation that occurred in a very energy efficient dwelling with a very low ventilation rate, an air exchange rate of about 1/10 per hour. Therefore, air leakage in most homes, and in non-residential buildings too, will generally remove the chemicals faster than the researchers reported for the plants tested by NASA. The most effective household plants reportedly included aloe vera, English ivy, and Boston fern for removing chemicals and biological compounds.|$|E
25|$|Not {{a single}} Latin colony {{defected}} to Hannibal, despite the latter's policy of treating the Latin colonists {{in the same}} way as other socii: i.e. releasing captured Latin soldiers without ransom and sparing the colonies' territory from devastation. The closest any Latin colonies came to mutiny was in 209 BC (after eight years of war), when 12 colonies sent a delegation to Rome to inform the Senate that they had run out of men and money and could supply no more troops. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>this</b> was not a defection to the enemy, but an attempt to pressure the Senate into making peace. The inhabitants of the colonies were descendants of Romans and original Latins and were bound to Rome by ethnic solidarity (although they had nominally lost their citizenship, they could automatically regain it by moving to Roman territory). In addition, the colonists occupied land seized from the neighbouring Italic tribes, which the latter were keen to regain. They therefore had little to gain and everything to lose by joining Hannibal's Italic coalition. (None even joined the Italian coalition in the Social War over a century later, when there was no external threat).|$|E

500|$|It {{is often}} said that [...] "Only perl can parse Perl", meaning that only the Perl {{interpreter}} (perl) can parse the Perl language (Perl), <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>this</b> is not, in general, true. Because the Perl interpreter can simulate a Turing machine during its compile phase, it would need to decide the halting problem in order to complete parsing in every case. It is a long-standing result that the halting problem is undecidable, and therefore not even perl can always parse Perl. Perl makes the unusual choice of giving the user access to its full programming power in its own compile phase. The cost in terms of theoretical purity is high, but practical inconvenience seems to be rare.|$|E
500|$|In {{collaboration}} with Engels, Marx also set about {{writing a book}} which is often seen as his best treatment {{of the concept of}} historical materialism, The German Ideology.

German Ideology is written in a humorously satirical form, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>this</b> satirical form did not save the work from censorship.
