The northern areas are slowly returning to native oaks with a hornbeam and hawthorn understory, and a woodland ground flora that includes wood false <b>brome</b> <b>grass</b> and wood spurge; the whole being interspersed with naturalising exotic thorns and service trees {{to add a}} cross-cultural dimension. Meanwhile, the sandy brickearth soils that extend from Church Street along Dr Watts' Walk to the chapel lawns, the sole surviving heathland in Hackney, are returning to a lighter structure based on silver birch woodland and healthy species such as bracken fern. Today, a range of woodland birds, mammals and butterflies are supported; the grounds forming one of north London's largest breeding sites {{so close to the}} City for some very attractive species such as the speckled wood butterfly.|$|E
2500|$|It is omnivorous, {{feeding on}} seeds, green vegetation, insects, and dried animal matter. It {{occasionally}} caches food. Redstem fialree (Erodium cicutarium) and <b>brome</b> <b>grass</b> (Bromus rubens) are important food {{items for the}} squirrels. However, their diet may differ depending {{on the time of}} day or time of year. [...] Green vegetation is the most common diet type from December to mid-April because it is the most abundant during this period. [...] Likewise, insects make up more than 90% of the squirrel's diet from mid-April to December because they are more abundant. [...] Although seeds are available for most of the year, it is not the preferable diet of the squirrels. They will choose insects or green vegetation when available over seeds, even if the seeds are more abundant and easier to access. [...] Some speculate that this could be due to the higher amount of water in insects and green vegetation, which would be necessary for the species to survive in such a hot, dry climate. [...] Unfortunately for the Nelson's antelope squirrel, there is not an abundant water source nearby. [...] Under laboratory conditions, the squirrels readily accept water. However, they can also survive at least 7 months in the shade without water. At the end of 7 months they appeared relatively healthy and not at all emaciated.|$|E

40|$|Included {{within the}} {{boundaries}} of the Grand-Staircase Escalante National Monument are a number of noxious weeds for which the BLM mandates control. In addition to listed weeds are nonnative <b>brome</b> <b>grasses</b> [Bromus tectorum and Bromus rubens), which can potentially convert native ecosystems to biologically impoverished annual grasslands. Although <b>brome</b> <b>grasses</b> occur virtually throughout the new Monument, they remain at relatively low biomass, with denser stands patchily distributed in former disturbances due to agriculture, road development, and fire. We discuss case studies indicating that this type of distribution often precedes habitat conversion by <b>brome</b> <b>grasses,</b> and we review various investigations related to how and why coverage expands. Measures should be taken to monitor the spread of <b>brome</b> <b>grasses,</b> and management strategies related to road development, tourism, fire, grazing, and habitat alteration and restoration should be consistent with the need to contain the distributions and abundances of these destructive weeds...|$|R

40|$|Two Eurasian {{invasive}} annual <b>brome</b> <b>grasses,</b> cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and Japanese brome (Bromus japonicus), {{are well}} known for their impact in steppe ecosystems of the western United States where these grasses have altered fire regimes, reduced native plant diversity and abundance, and degraded wildlife habitat. Annual bromes are also abundant in the grasslands of the Northern Great Plains (NGP), but their impact and ecology are not as well studied. It is unclear whether the {{lessons learned from the}} steppe will translate to the mixed-grass prairie where native plant species are adapted to frequent fires and grazing. Developing a successful annual brome management strategy for National Park Service units and other NGP grasslands requires better understanding of (1) the impact of annual bromes on grassland condition; (2) the dynamics of these species through space and time; and (3) the relative importance of environmental factors within and outside managers’ control for these spatiotemporal dynamics. Here, we use vegetation monitoring data collected from 1998 to 2015 in 295 sites to relate spatiotemporal variability of annual <b>brome</b> <b>grasses</b> to grassland composition, weather, physical environmental characteristics, and ecological processes (grazing and fire). Concern about the impact of these species in NGP grasslands is warranted, as we found a decline in native species richness with increasing annual brome cover. Annual brome cover generally increased over the time of monitoring but also displayed a 3 -to 5 -yr cycle of reduction and resurgence. Relative cover of annual bromes in the monitored areas was best predicted by park unit, weather, extant plant community, slope grade, soil composition, and fire history. We found no evidence that grazing reduced annual brome cover, but {{this may be due to}} the relatively low grazing pressure in our study. By understanding the consequences and patterns of annual brome invasion, we will be better able to preserve and restore these grassland landscapes for future generations...|$|R

Scientists have gained {{knowledge of the}} diet of G. rufus {{through the use of}} feces as a source of DNA. It has been documented to eat plants of the genus Bromus, the species Holcus lanatus, and the subfamily Pooideae, all within the family Poaceae. Poaceae is a family of flowering monocots whose members are referred to as true grasses. Pooideae includes lawn grasses and cereals such as wheat and barley. Bromus is composed of <b>grasses</b> called <b>brome</b> <b>grasses</b> or cheat grasses. Holcus lanatus, more commonly known as Yorkshire fog or velvet grass, is a species of perennial pasture grass noted for its hairy texture. The rufous grasshopper has also been known to sparingly eat other plants such as rushes.|$|R
