5|$|Troponin is a {{sensitive}} <b>biomarker</b> {{for a heart}} with insufficient blood supply. It is released 4–6 hours after injury, and usually peaks at about 12–24 hours. Two tests of troponin are often taken – one {{at the time of}} initial presentation, and another within 3–6 hours, with either a high level or a significant rise being diagnostic. A test for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be used to evaluate for the presence of heart failure, and rises when there is increased demand on the left ventricle. These tests are considered biomarkers because they are highly specific for cardiac disease. Testing for the MB form of creatine kinase provides information about the heart's blood supply, but is used less frequently because it is less specific and sensitive.|$|E

25|$|One {{problem with}} using a {{specific}} collagen type II <b>biomarker</b> from {{the breakdown of}} articular cartilage is {{that the amount of}} cartilage is reduced (worn away) over time with progression of the disease so a patient can eventually have very advanced osteoarthritis with none of this <b>biomarker</b> detectable in their urine. Another problem with a systemic <b>biomarker</b> is that a patient can have osteoarthritis in multiple joints at different stages of disease at the same time, so the <b>biomarker</b> source cannot be determined. Some other collagen breakdown products in the synovial fluid correlated with each other after acute injuries (a known cause of secondary osteoarthritis) but did not correlate with the severity of the injury.|$|E

50|$|<b>Biomarkers</b> can be {{classified}} based on different parameters. They can {{be classified}} based on their characteristics such as imaging <b>biomarkers</b> (CT, PET, MRI) or molecular <b>biomarkers.</b> Molecular <b>biomarkers</b> {{can be used to}} refer to nonimaging <b>biomarkers</b> that have biophysical properties, which allow their measurements in biological samples (e.g., plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage, biopsy) and include nucleic acids-based <b>biomarkers</b> such as gene mutations or polymorphisms and quantitative gene expression analysis, peptides, proteins, lipids metabolites, and other small molecules. <b>Biomarkers</b> can also be classified based on their application such as diagnostic <b>biomarkers</b> (i.e., cardiac troponin for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction), staging of disease <b>biomarkers</b> (i.e., brain natriuretic peptide for congestive heart failure), disease prognosis <b>biomarkers</b> (cancer <b>biomarkers),</b> and <b>biomarkers</b> for monitoring the clinical response to an intervention (HbAlc for antidiabetic treatment). Another category of <b>biomarkers</b> includes those used in decision making in early drug development.

25|$|In oncology, class III β-tubulin {{has been}} {{investigated}} as both a prognostic <b>biomarker</b> and an indicator of resistance to taxanes and other compounds. The majority of reports implicate class III β-tubulin as a <b>biomarker</b> of poor outcome. However, there are also data in clear cell carcinoma, melanoma and breast cancer showing favorable prognosis. Class III β-tubulin is integral component of a pro-survival, cascading molecular pathway which renders cancer cells resistant to apoptosis and enhances their ability to invade local tissues and metastasize. Class III β-tubulin performs best as a prognostic <b>biomarker</b> when analyzed {{in the context of}} an integrated signature including upstream regulators and downstream effectors.

30|$|Functional imaging <b>biomarkers</b> are {{increasingly}} used as pharmacodynamic <b>biomarkers.</b> Relative to molecular imaging <b>biomarkers,</b> which are target-specific, functional imaging <b>biomarkers</b> {{have the advantage}} of being downstream markers that probe general capabilities of disease, including cell death, proliferation, glycolysis, hypoxia, tumor invasiveness, angiogenesis, inflammation and fibrosis. Although a lot of functional imaging <b>biomarkers</b> have been proposed as pharmacodynamic <b>biomarkers</b> in early drug development, most of these <b>biomarkers</b> need further validation and standardization for their qualification in phase 1 and 2 human studies.|$|R
30|$|There is {{increasing}} {{interest in developing}} the quantitative imaging of <b>biomarkers</b> in personalised medicine. <b>Biomarkers</b> are defined as “characteristics that are objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal biological processes, pathological processes, or pharmaceutical responses to a therapeutic intervention” [1]. Broadly, <b>biomarkers</b> fall into two categories: bio-specimen <b>biomarkers,</b> including molecular <b>biomarkers</b> and genetic <b>biomarkers,</b> and bio-signal <b>biomarkers</b> or imaging <b>biomarkers.</b> Bio-specimen <b>biomarkers</b> are obtained by removing a sample from a patient. Examples of these molecular <b>biomarkers</b> are genes and proteins detected from fluids or tissue samples. Bio-signal <b>biomarkers</b> remove no material from the patient, but rather detect and analyse an electromagnetic, photonic or acoustic signal emitted by the patient [2]. These imaging <b>biomarkers</b> {{have the advantage of}} being non-invasive, spatially resolved and repeatable [3]. They are of particular interest if they can overcome the limitations of the established histological “gold standards”. Indeed, invasive reference examinations, such as biopsy, can be inconclusive, are non-representative of the whole tissue (which is a tremendous limitation when assessing malignant tumours, which are known to be heterogeneous) and possess non-negligible levels of mortality and morbidity.|$|R

40|$|<b>Biomarkers</b> {{indicate}} the status or condition {{of a specific}} biological property. In principle, <b>biomarkers</b> are generally classified into three categories: <b>biomarkers</b> of exposure, <b>biomarkers</b> of effect, and <b>biomarkers</b> of susceptibility 1, 2, 3. <b>Biomarkers</b> of exposure indicate that the organism is or has been exposed to a specific class of xenobiotics or environmental conditions. <b>Biomarkers</b> of effect are indicative of alterations in molecular and cellular processes of an organism {{as a result of}} a xenobiotic or environmental exposure. <b>Biomarkers</b> of susceptibility reflect the risk for which an organism may acquire an altered physiological condition. The major difficulty in the application of <b>biomarkers</b> within toxicology is defining and linking different <b>biomarkers</b> within and between categories into an integrated system that can (1) identify a stressor or stressors affecting an organism, (2) distinguish between different physiological conditions (3) elucidate the mechanism of toxicity as a result of the interaction, and (4) predict the fate of the interaction 2.

30|$|Genetic <b>biomarkers</b> {{indicate}} whether a disease may occur, {{but they are}} usually inefficient to assess the presence and stage of a disease. Similar to molecular <b>biomarkers,</b> imaging <b>biomarkers</b> {{can be used for}} early detection of diseases, staging and grading, and predicting or assessing the response to treatment [3]. Accordingly, because of their relative lower cost compared with imaging, molecular <b>biomarkers</b> may be more appropriate for disease screening and early detection than imaging <b>biomarkers.</b> With their high sensitivity, molecular <b>biomarkers</b> could also detect subclinical stages of disease before any morphological or functional change is detectable on imaging. In contrast, imaging <b>biomarkers</b> are often more useful than molecular <b>biomarkers</b> for disease staging, and also grading and for assessing tumour response, because localised information is crucial.|$|R

40|$|New renal <b>biomarkers</b> {{measured}} in urine promise to increase specificity for risk stratification and early diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) but concomitantly may be altered by urine concentration effects and chronic renal insufficiency. This study therefore directly compared {{the performance of}} AKI <b>biomarkers</b> in urine and plasma. This single-center, prospective cohort study included 110 unselected adults undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass between 2009 and 2010. Plasma and/or urine concentrations of creatinine, cystatin C, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM 1), and albumin as well as 15 additional <b>biomarkers</b> in plasma and urine were measured during the perioperative period. The primary outcome was AKI defined by AKIN serum creatinine criteria within 72 hours after surgery. <b>Biomarkers</b> in plasma showed markedly better discriminative performance for preoperative risk stratification and early postoperative (within 24 h after surgery) detection of AKI than urine <b>biomarkers.</b> Discriminative power of urine <b>biomarkers</b> improved when concentrations were normalized to urinary creatinine, but urine <b>biomarkers</b> had still lower AUC values than plasma <b>biomarkers.</b> Best diagnostic performance 4 h after surgery had plasma NGAL (AUC 0. 83), cystatin C (0. 76), MIG (0. 74), and L-FAPB (0. 73). Combinations of multiple <b>biomarkers</b> did not improve their diagnostic power. Preoperative clinical scoring systems (EuroSCORE and Cleveland Clinic Foundation Score) predicted the risk for AKI (AUC 0. 76 and 0. 71) and were not inferior to <b>biomarkers.</b> Preexisting chronic kidney disease limited the diagnostic performance of both plasma and urine <b>biomarkers.</b> In our cohort plasma <b>biomarkers</b> had higher discriminative power for risk stratification and early diagnosis of AKI than urine <b>biomarkers.</b> For preoperative risk stratification of AKI clinical models showed similar discriminative performance to <b>biomarkers.</b> The discriminative performance of both plasma and urine <b>biomarkers</b> was reduced by preexisting chronic kidney disease...|$|R
