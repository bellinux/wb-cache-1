5|$|Over the centuries, {{the book}} has been rebound several times. During an 18th-century rebinding, the pages were rather unsympathetically cropped, with small parts of some {{illustrations}} being lost. The book was also rebound in 1895, but that rebinding broke down quickly. By the late 1920s, several folios had detached completely and were kept separate from the main volume. In 1953, <b>bookbinder</b> Roger Powell rebound the manuscript in four volumes and stretched several pages that had developed bulges. Two volumes can normally be seen displayed at Trinity, one opened at a major decorated page, and one opened to show two text pages with smaller decorations.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{bookbinding}} by hand {{can be seen}} as two closely allied fields: {{the creation}} of new bindings, and the repair of existing bindings. Bookbinders are often active in both fields. Bookbinders can learn the craft through apprenticeship; by attending specialized trade schools; by taking classes in the course of university studies, or by a combination of those methods. Some European countries offer a Master <b>Bookbinder</b> certification, though no such certification exists in the United States. MFA programs that specialize in the 'Book Arts' (hand paper-making, printmaking and bookbinding) are available through certain colleges and universities.|$|E

25|$|Bookbinding is {{an artistic}} craft of great antiquity, {{and at the}} same time, a highly {{mechanized}} industry. The division between craft and industry is not so wide as might at first be imagined. It is interesting to observe that the main problems faced by the mass-production <b>bookbinder</b> are the same as those that confronted the medieval craftsman or the modern hand binder. The first problem is still how to hold together the pages of a book; secondly is how to cover and protect the gathering of pages once they are held together; and thirdly, how to label and decorate the protective cover.|$|E
