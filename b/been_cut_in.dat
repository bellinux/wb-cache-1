Ferns and gorse are common too, and in areas where peat has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the past, there are bog mosses, the bog bean Menyanthus trifoliata, and marsh pennywort.|$|E
5|$|The North Front defences, still {{following}} the course {{laid out by}} the Moors in the 11th century, are still substantially intact. A {{significant portion of the}} original Spanish and Moorish walls can still be seen, rising in a saw-tooth (en crémaillère) fashion from the Grand Battery. Although gaps have <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the walls to allow vehicle traffic to enter the city centre, pedestrians can still walk over the wooden drawbridge over the North Front ditch to pass through the Landport Gate into the city. The Moorish Tower of Homage continues to stand above the Grand Battery on the lower slopes of the Rock. It is now open to the public as part of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Development since 1850 {{has greatly}} altered the {{places in the}} {{watershed}} where plants and animals can thrive. In a report published in 2005, the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES), using data from an early General Land Office survey, compared the watershed of 1851 with that of 2003. The study showed {{that all of the}} watershed provided plant and wildlife habitat in 1851, but by 2003 only 33percent provided habitat. In 1851, water covered 10percent of the watershed but that had <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> half by 2003. Marshes and other wetlands that had comprised 22percent of the earlier watershed dwindled to 1percent by 2003, while the percentage of land devoted to industry, commerce, and homes rose from 0 to 34. In addition, habitat remaining in 2003 was greatly disturbed, dominated by Himalayan blackberry and other invasive species and fragmented by roads. The riparian zone along the slough was generally narrow or nonexistent and devoid of trees and shrubs in places, including along the levees.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{approval}} of Gardasil in 2006 and despite low vaccine uptake, prevalence of HPV among teenagers aged 14–19 has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> half with an 88% reduction among vaccinated women. No decline in prevalence was observed in other age groups, indicating the vaccine to {{have been responsible for}} the sharp decline in cases. The drop in number of infections is expected to in turn lead to a decline in cervical and other HPV-related cancers in the future.|$|E

25|$|Group Q5-2 {{features}} a large block of cut limestone {{that may have}} functioned as the base for a stela. The group is also notable for a small cave underneath the principal structure. Near the cave entrance was found a large shell that had <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> half lengthwise in order {{to serve as a}} scribe's inkwell, as illustrated in Maya art. Because of this inkwell, the excavators have interpreted this group as the residence of a scribe. The group has been dated to the Late Classic.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 the C2RMF {{researchers}} published {{results of}} further investigations to establish when the Paris skull had been carved. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated {{the use of}} lapidary machine tools in its carving. The results of a new dating technique known as quartz hydration dating (QHD) demonstrated that the Paris skull had been carved later than a reference quartz specimen artifact, known to have <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> 1740. The researchers conclude that the SEM and QHD results combined with the skull's known provenance indicate it was carved in the 18th or 19th century.|$|E

25|$|In September 1954, 813 {{embarked}} {{with their}} Wyverns on HMS Albion for carrier-based {{service in the}} Mediterranean. The Wyvern soon showed a worrying habit for flameout on catapult launch; the high G forces resulting in fuel starvation. A number of aircraft were lost off Albion's bows and Lt. B. D. Macfarlane made history on 13 October 1954 when he successfully ejected from under water after his aircraft had ditched on launch and <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> two by the carrier. 813 {{did not return to}} Albion until March 1955 when the problems had been resolved.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Route 4 {{service to}} Ft. Howard, which had <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> half {{less than a}} year earlier, was {{eliminated}} completely, and service the remaining parts of the line was reduced to one bus every 70 minutes. The proposal to eliminate service to Ft. Howard drew protests that were filmed by local news stations. A private contractor was chartered to provide this service following elimination. In 1997, MTA once again started to run a bus to Ft. Howard. A new Route 6 that ran from Eastpoint Mall to Ft. Howard, mostly via North Point Road, was briefly added in 1997, but was discontinued a year later.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{two days}} later, the 2/6th Infantry {{exploited}} further, attacking and taking Komiatum Ridge with two companies, after a heavy artillery preparation. The {{result of this}} was the encirclement of Japanese troops on Mount Tambu, their supply routes between Komiatum and Davidson Ridge having <b>been</b> <b>cut.</b> <b>In</b> an effort to prevent a break out between Komiatum and Bobdubi, the Australian divisional commander, Savige, ordered a follow up attack by the 15th Brigade towards the Salamaua Track. On 17 August, the 2/3rd Independent Company secured the junction of the Bobdubi–Salamaua Track, and then held it against heavy Japanese counter-attacks, which were finally defeated on 19 August.|$|E
