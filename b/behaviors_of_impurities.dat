40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{a work in}} progress on the reconstruction of radial profiles for the ion effective charge Zeff on the TEXTOR tokamak, using statistical data analysis techniques. We introduce our diagnostic for the measurement of bremsstrahlung emissivity signals. Zeff profiles can be determined by Abelinversion of line-integrated measurements of the bremsstrahlung emissivity (ǫff) from the plasma and the plasma electron density (ne) and temperature (Te). However, at the plasma edge only estimated values are routinely used for ne and Te, which are moreover determined at different toroidal locations. These various uncertainties hinder the interpretation of a Zeff profile outside the central plasma. In order to circumvent this problem, we propose several scenarios meant to allow the extraction by (Bayesian) Blind Source Separation techniques of either (lineintegrated) Zeff waveshapes or absolutely calibrated signals from (line-integrated) emissivity signals, using also density and temperature signals, as required. 1. The role <b>of</b> <b>impurities</b> and Zeff in a tokamak plasma The <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> plasma <b>impurities</b> in a tokamak plasma is a critical issue [1]. On the one hand, these impurities increase the fuel dilution and, at reactor parameters, they can be responsible for a considerable power loss from the plasma core by bremsstrahlung. On the other hand, line radiation by low-Z impurities at the plasma edge can be advantageous for the reduction of the plasma-wall interaction. To study the <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> <b>impurities</b> in the plasma, one needs a local measure for impurity concentration. A parameter of great interest is the so-called ion effective charge of the plasma, Zeff, which is averaged over all species. Once the plasma electron density (ne) and temperature (Te) are known, it is proportional to the bremsstrahlung emissivity (ǫff) from the plasma [2], which originates mainly from the acceleration of electrons in the field of ions: ǫff ∼ n 2 e Zeff √, where Zeff...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSolid helium is paradoxical: {{it is both}} a {{model and}} an exception. It is a model for crystal {{properties}} mainly because of its extreme purity which makes universal phenomena simpler and easier to identify. It is also exceptional because the large quantum fluctuations of atoms around the nodes in their crystal lattice allow these phenomena to occur at very low temperature with a large amplitude. As noticed by Jacques Friedel in 2013, the properties of helium 4 crystals illustrate how the motion of dislocations may reduce their shear elastic modulus, {{as it does in}} all hexagonal close packed (hcp) crystals including metals. But this motion takes place without any dissipation in the limit of T= 0 and in the absence <b>of</b> <b>impurities,</b> which is now exceptional and leads to an elastic anomaly at low temperature, which was called “giant plasticity” by Haziot et al. in 2013. More recently, we have discovered that, in helium- 4 crystals, helium- 3 impurities are not necessarily fixed pinning centers for dislocations. Even at relatively large velocities, dislocations are able to move dressed with impurities somehow as a necklace of atomic pearls through the periodic lattice.

Molecular dynamics simulations are used to calculate the segregation energies for carbon within multiple grain boundary sites over a database of 125 symmetric tilt grain boundaries in Fe. The simulation results show that the majority of atomic sites near the grain boundary have segregation energies lower than in the bulk. Moreover, depending on the boundary, the segregation energies approach the bulk value approximately 5 - 12 Å away from the center of the grain boundary, providing an energetic length scale for carbon segregation.
