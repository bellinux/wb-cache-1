5|$|The CSBS and the {{improved}} version, the Mk. X were insufficient, as both were {{too large to}} easily stabilize. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it was built, the Automatic Bomb Sight could be equipped with a stabilizer but {{it was estimated that}} it would be some time before it could be modified and brought into production. The Norden did offer stabilization but it also required relatively long setup times and was still not available for purchase.|$|E
5|$|Divergence and convergence: In {{the human}} cerebellum, {{information}} from 200 million mossy fiber inputs is expanded to 40 billion granule cells, whose parallel fiber outputs then converge onto 15 million Purkinje cells. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{that they are}} lined up longitudinally, the 1000 or so Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone may receive input from as many as 100 million parallel fibers, and focus their own output down {{to a group of}} less than 50 deep nuclear cells. Thus, the cerebellar network receives a modest number of inputs, processes them very extensively through its rigorously structured internal network, and sends out the results via a very limited number of output cells.|$|E

30|$|Here, however, a {{new problem}} arises. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which {{technology}} mediates individuals, individuals {{interact with each other}} in ways defined by technology. That is, new technology allows individuals to interact in an unprecedented manner, while also restricting them to interact within <b>the</b> limits <b>of</b> “the specific <b>way</b> that <b>the</b> technology allows.” This implies that technology can be considered a coercive force that restricts individuals’ activities.|$|R

5|$|The problem {{occurred}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{the vehicles}} were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed {{that although the}} brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side. This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the front passenger and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, {{some of which were}} registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{aircraft}} {{is complicated by}} the fact that the aircraft's background varies widely, depending on the location of the observer, the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often painted to match the sky when viewed from below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline when viewed from above. This is a form of countershading, likely to work best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not do fly inverted during combat. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> light hits it, patterns of dark and light will often be present on an aircraft even if it is entirely one color, making it easier to see Reflections and specular highlights can be counteracted by painting an aircraft in neutral shades with a non-reflective, matte finish. There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage and the size of recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk of friendly fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Fellow {{players on}} the Italian {{national}} team nicknamed Pirlo l'architetto ("the Architect"), <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which he buildt plays, and set up goal-scoring opportunities with long, lobbed through passes. In later seasons, Juventus fans also dubbed him il professore ("the professor"), Maestro, and Mozart, as {{a reference to the}} Austrian composer's prodigious ability. Pirlo was also frequently compared to fellow former Milan and Italy playmaker Demetrio Albertini early in his Milan career, due to their similar characteristics and style of play. Pirlo was often thought to be Albertini's heir for Milan and the national side; he inherited his nickname the metronome whilst playing at Milan, for the way in which he influenced games by controlling the tempo of his team's play through his direct and efficient passing game in midfield, as well as his ability to make himself available to teammates to receive and distribute the ball.|$|E
50|$|For example, IBM {{mainframe}} computers encode {{floating point}} numbers in hexadecimal format and character data in EBCDIC, while IBM Personal computers encode them in IEEE format and ASCII. Further complexity arose <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which various programming language compilers map record fields onto strings of bits, bytes, and words in memory. Transparent conversion of a record requires detailed descriptions <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> client view and <b>the</b> server view <b>of</b> a record. Given these descriptions, <b>the</b> fields <b>of</b> <b>the</b> client and server views can be matched, by field name, and appropriate conversions can be performed.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I examine picturebook {{narratives}} of bodily transformation from a narratological lens, analyzing existing criticisms and arguing {{for a serious}} study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> picturebook. Through these texts of bodily transformation, I explore the picturebook’s nonlinear, often recursive structure, as well as <b>the</b> narratological impact(s) <b>of</b> metafiction upon these texts. I conclude these analyses by examining where each of these two narrative elements push against and/or build upon the other. These texts, I argue, {{can get away with}} murder, bodily harm, transformation, etc. <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> linearity and metafiction both confine and release these narratives to/from <b>the</b> pages <b>of</b> their respective books...|$|R
5|$|The new route added several locks to the canal, making {{water supply}} {{problems}} more severe. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{the system of}} locks work, water is lost from {{the upper part of}} a canal each time a vessel passes through. This is a particular issue for the pound between Bradford Lock at Bradford on Avon and the Bath Locks, where a series of locks need to be opened each time the gates are opened. Most lock gates are not watertight, therefore some water leaks from the higher levels of the canal to those lower down. The water has to be replaced, or eventually the upper levels of the canal would not hold enough water to be navigable. Canals are usually fed by diverting water from streams and rivers into the upper parts of the canal, but if no suitable source is available or sufficient, a pumping station, such as the one at Claverton, can be used to maintain the water level. Crofton Pumping Station was built to supply water to the summit pound of the canal, opening in 1810 but, unlike Claverton, was powered by steam.|$|E
5|$|Why {{they went}} to land {{in the first place}} is still debated. One reason could be that the small juveniles who had {{completed}} their metamorphosis had what it took to make use of what land had to offer. Already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (just as modern fish and amphibians often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests), two very different niches partially overlapped each other, with the young juveniles in the diffuse line between. One of them was overcrowded and dangerous while the other was much safer and much less crowded, offering less competition over resources. The terrestrial niche was also a much more challenging place for primary aquatic animals, but <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> evolution and selection pressure work, those juveniles who could take advantage of this would be rewarded. Once they gained a small foothold on land, thanks to their preadaptations and being at {{the right place at the}} right time, favourable variations in their descendants would gradually result in continuing evolution and diversification.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{airframe}} loads {{are distributed}} while operating on rough ground, tailwheel aircraft {{are better able}} to sustain this type of use {{over a long period of}} time, without cumulative airframe damage occurring.|$|E
25|$|Debate {{continues}} as to <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unidentified ghost rockets.

This prompted the Swedish Army to issue a directive stating that newspapers were not to report <b>the</b> exact location <b>of</b> ghost rocket sightings, or any information regarding the direction or speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object. This information, they reasoned, was vital for evaluation purposes to the nation or nations performing the tests.|$|R

The rivalry between the main characters was based on the several dramas the staff liked.

25|$|The inchworm, or looper {{caterpillars}} {{from the}} family Geometridae are so named <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they move, appearing to measure the earth (the word geometrid means earth-measurer in Greek); {{the primary reason for}} this unusual locomotion is the elimination of nearly all the prolegs except the clasper on the terminal segment.|$|E
40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (M. tb) has co-evolved {{with humans}} {{for thousands of}} years, to cause tuberculosis (TB). <b>The</b> success <b>of</b> M. tb as a pathogen is in part <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which M. tb evades and exploits different cell subsets, to persist and cause disease. M. tb expresses numerous molecules to prevent its recognition and destruction by immune cells. The only licensed vaccine against TB, Bacillle Calmette-Guerin (BCG), is effective at preventing disseminated disease in infants but confers highly variable efficacy against pulmonary TB in adults, particularly in the developing world. A greater understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons for this variability, together with a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early, innate, and non-antigen specific mechanisms of protection would facilitate the design and development of more effective vaccines...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This article {{reflects}} on <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> a chief officer {{and in particular}} <b>the</b> former Commissioner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Metropolitan Police Sir Ian Blair. The overlapping political structures in London that he found himself working under led to an expressed wish for simplification. However, the hoped for outcomes {{can be seen as}} leading directly to his removal from office; it also forms the context for actual and proposed changes in police governance. His wider involvement in politics leads him to argue that a chief officer should be able to speak in public as a neutral expert. I question that <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which all kinds of expert knowledge claims are subject to challenge. With wider changes in political control possible or likely, the skill and judgment of chief officers in engaging with politics will become an even higher-profile concern...|$|R
