As technical director, he made several more trips to the Soviet Union, helping to negotiate the seventeen-point agreement that would govern {{the conduct of the}} mission.

5|$|From 31 October to 15 November, the Wehrmacht {{high command}} stood down while {{preparing}} {{to launch a}} second offensive towards Moscow. Although Army Group Centre still possessed considerable nominal strength, its fighting capabilities had thoroughly diminished because of combat fatigue. While the Germans {{were aware of the}} continuous influx of Soviet reinforcements from the east as well as the presence of large reserves, given the tremendous Soviet casualties, they did not expect the Soviets to be able to mount a determined defense. But in comparison to the situation in October, Soviet rifle divisions occupied a much stronger defensive position: a triple defensive ring surrounding the city and some remnants of the Mozhaisk line near Klin. Most of the Soviet field armies now had a multilayered defense, with at least two rifle divisions in second echelon positions. Artillery support and sapper teams were also concentrated along major roads that German troops were expected to use in their attacks. There were also many Soviet troops still available in reserve armies behind the front. Finally, Soviet troops—and especially officers—were now more experienced and <b>better</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> the offensive.|$|E
5|$|Muslims of Bombay elected Jinnah, though then {{absent in}} London, as their {{representative}} to the Central Legislative Assembly in October 1934. The British Parliament's Government of India Act 1935 gave considerable power to India's provinces, with a weak central parliament in New Delhi, which had no authority over such matters as foreign policy, defence, {{and much of the}} budget. Full power remained {{in the hands of the}} Viceroy, however, who could dissolve legislatures and rule by decree. The League reluctantly accepted the scheme, though expressing reservations about the weak parliament. The Congress was much <b>better</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> the provincial elections in 1937, and the League failed to win a majority even of the Muslim seats in any of the provinces where members of that faith held a majority. It did win a majority of the Muslim seats in Delhi, but could not form a government anywhere, though it was part of the ruling coalition in Bengal. The Congress and its allies formed the government even in the North-West Frontier Province (N.W.F.P.), where the League won no seats despite the fact that almost all residents were Muslim.|$|E

5|$|Several factors {{influenced}} the {{decision made by}} the Australian Government in October 1942 to recall the 9th Division to Australia. Most importantly, the Government and {{the commander of the}} Australian Military Forces, General Thomas Blamey, wanted to relieve the 6th and 7th Divisions from combat in the New Guinea Campaign and Blamey considered the 9th Division to be <b>better</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> this responsibility than the Australian Army's militia forces or US Army units. The commander of Allied forces in the South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur, had also been pressing the US and Australian Governments for reinforcements to conduct offensive operations against Japanese positions. Other factors influencing the Australian Government's decision were a desire to concentrate the Australian Army in a single theatre, the increasing difficulty in finding replacements for the 9th Division's casualties given the Army's manpower shortages, the political difficulties associated with implementing reforms to permit militia units to serve outside Australian territory, and concerns that a prolonged absence from Australia would affect morale among the 9th Division's soldiers.|$|E

25|$|The raid on Harpers Ferry is {{generally}} {{thought to have}} done much to set the nation on a course toward civil war. Southern slaveowners, hearing initial reports that hundreds of abolitionists were involved, were relieved the effort was so small. Yet they feared other abolitionists would emulate Brown and attempt to lead slave rebellions. Therefore, the South reorganized the decrepit militia system. These militias, well-established by 1861, became a ready-made Confederate army, making the South <b>better</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> war.|$|E

25|$|Stationed in the Caucasus in Georgia and Armenia was the Russian Caucasus Corps, {{composed}} of approximately 50,000 men and 202 guns under the overall command of Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich, Governor General of the Caucasus. The Russian force stood opposed by an Ottoman Army of 100,000 men led by General Ahmed Muhtar Pasha. While the Russian army was <b>better</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> {{the fighting in}} the region, it lagged behind technologically in certain areas such as heavy artillery and was outgunned, for example, by the superior long-range Krupp artillery that Germany had supplied to the Ottomans.|$|E
25|$|The Luftwaffe {{was much}} <b>better</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> {{the task of}} air-sea rescue than the RAF, {{specifically}} tasking the Seenotdienst unit, equipped with about 30 Heinkel He 59 floatplanes, with picking up downed aircrew from the North Sea, English Channel and the Dover Straits. In addition, Luftwaffe aircraft were equipped with life rafts and the aircrew were provided with sachets of a chemical called fluorescein which, on reacting with water, created a large, easy-to-see, bright green patch. In accordance with the Geneva Convention, the He 59s were unarmed and painted white with civilian registration markings and red crosses. Nevertheless, RAF aircraft attacked these aircraft, as some were escorted by Bf 109s.|$|E
25|$|Opelika High School's 2014-2015 Advanced Placement results {{indicated}} a 150 {{percent increase in}} the number of qualifying scores achieved by students in AP math, science and English exams. In its first year of program participation, Opelika High School had 63 more course enrollments in rigorous AP classes than in the year prior and students earned qualifying scores on 45 AP exams. Driving the increases in student achievement is the implementation of the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE)/A+ College Ready AP Program, which OHS began implementing in 2014. The goals of the program are to boost student enrollment and achievement, particularly for under-represented student groups in rigorous AP courses and to build a pipeline of students <b>better</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> college and careers.|$|E

25|$|In a {{memorandum}} entitled Guard the Frontiers and Protect the Borders that he {{presented to the}} throne in 169 BC, Chao compared the relative strengths of Xiongnu and Han battle tactics. In regards to the Han armies, Chao deemed the Xiongnu horsemen <b>better</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> rough terrain due to their better horses, better with horseback archery, and better able to withstand the elements and harsh climates. However, on level plains, he regarded Xiongnu cavalry inferior especially when faced with Han shock cavalry and chariots as the Xiongnu are easily dispersed. He emphasized that the Xiongnu were incapable of countering the superior equipment and weaponry. He also noted that in contrast the Han armies were better capable to fight in disciplined formations. According to Chao, the Xiongnu were also defenseless against coordinated onslaughts of arrows—especially long-ranged and in unison—due to their inferior leather armor and wooden shields. When dismounted in close combat, {{he believed that the}} Xiongnu, lacking the ability as infantry, would be decimated by Han soldiers.|$|E
25|$|After {{painting}} {{a series of}} pictures, {{some of which are}} still in existence today, I was still dissatisfied and yet <b>better</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> experiments that would go deeper. It was in 1910 that, for the first time, I showed in the Salon des Indépendants and completely abandoned the salon of the Nationale, where there was nothing more for me to do. I sent to the Cours-la-Reine a full figure, a full sized portrait of the poet René Arcos, as well as two landscapes of the area round Paris, simple collections of masses in restrained colours. From that moment onwards, I can see it clearly now, my researches passed from the surface to the interior of the plastic problem. So 1910 brought another white stone to my life, as it would mark a stage which, if it was not conclusive, would at least be very positive. Above all {{in the second half of}} that year, when I painted the canvasses which would appear in the Salon des Indépendants of 1911.|$|E
25|$|The Justice and Development Party (AKP), {{which had}} governed Turkey since 2002, lost its {{parliamentary}} majority and won 258 seats with 40.9% of the vote. The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) also fared worse than their 2011 result, and won 132 seats with 25.0% of the vote. The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) had been projected {{to win over}} many disaffected voters from the AKP. Its share of the vote increased, and the party won 80 seats with 16.3% of the vote. The new Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) decided to contest the election as a party rather than fielding candidates as independents, despite concerns {{that it could have}} fallen below the 10% election threshold and lose all representation in Parliament. The party fared better than expectations: it won 13.1% of the vote and took 80 seats, the same as the MHP. The potential for a hung parliament had been widely considered and predicted before the election so the country and politicians were <b>better</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> the constitutional process that would follow such a result.|$|E

25|$|The United Kingdom general {{election}} of 2010 {{was held on}} Thursday, 6 May 2010, with 45,597,461 registered voters entitled to vote to elect members to the House of Commons. The election took place in 650 constituencies across the United Kingdom under the first-past-the-post system. None of the parties achieved the 326 seats needed for an overall majority. The Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, won {{the largest number of}} votes and seats, but still fell 20 seats short. This resulted in a hung parliament where no party was able to command a majority in the House of Commons. This was only the second {{general election}} since the Second World War to return a hung parliament, the first being the February 1974 election. Unlike in 1974, the potential for a hung parliament had this time been widely considered and predicted, and both the country and politicians were <b>better</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> the constitutional process that would follow such a result. The coalition government that was subsequently formed was the first coalition in British history to eventuate directly from an election outcome. The hung parliament came about in spite of the Conservatives managing both a higher vote total and higher share of the vote than the previous Labour government had done in 2005, when it secured a comfortable majority.|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of Cyclone Alby, an appeal for relief in the {{affected}} region was made by The Lord Mayor's Distress Relief Fund.
