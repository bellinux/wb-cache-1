50|$|The {{solubility}} {{of barium}} borate is a disadvantage when {{used as a}} pigment. Silica-coated powders are available. The alkaline properties and the anodic passivation properties of the borate ion enhance the anticorrosion performance. Commonly available <b>barium</b> <b>metaborate</b> pigment comes in three grades; Grade I is a <b>barium</b> <b>metaborate</b> itself, grade II is compounded with 27% zinc oxide, and grade III is compounded with 18% of zinc oxide and 29% calcium sulfate. Barium borate shows synergistic performance with zinc borate.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, it was {{targeted}} to the enhance thermal stability and wettability behavior of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) by adding <b>barium</b> <b>metaborate.</b> TPU-Barium metaborate composites were prepared by adding various proportions of <b>barium</b> <b>metaborate</b> to TPU. The chemical {{structures of the}} composites were characterised by {{fourier transform infrared spectroscopy}} (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. All prepared composites have extremely high Tg and thermal stability as determined from DSC and TGA analysis. All composite materials have the Tg ranging from 15 to 35 °C. The surface morphologies of the composites were investigated by a scanning electron microscopy. Mechanical properties of the samples were characterized with stress-strain test. Hydrophobicity of the samples was determined by the contact angle measurements. The obtained results proved that thermal, hydrophobic and mechanical properties were improved...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the microstructure of crystals generated in borate glass by femtosecond laser irradiation (FSLI). The distribution of the high-temperature and low-temperature phases of <b>barium</b> <b>metaborate</b> crystals produced in the borate glass is analyzed using Raman spectroscopy. We then propose the possible mechanism for the generation of crystals in glass by FSLI...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{distribution}} of generated microcrystallites in borate glass irradiated by 120 fs laser pulses at a central wavelength of 800 nm. Raman spectroscopy is used to investigate {{the distribution of the}} high and low temperature phases of <b>barium</b> <b>metaborate</b> crystals generated in the borate glass. In combination with a microexplosion model, bond-breaking induced by laser irradiation is served as the origin of the formation of BBO crystals. Depending on the laser fluence and cooling conditions, the distribution mechanisms have been discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Low-temperature <b>barium</b> <b>metaborate</b> â-BaB 2 O 4 {{has been}} grown using a LiBa 2 B 5 O 10 -based solvent in a four-mirror optical {{floating}} zone furnace with a traveling solvent zone configuration. The â-BaB 2 O 4 rods grown {{are composed of}} several different crystal domains, ranging from 100 ím to 1 mm in diameter, and lithium, {{a component of the}} flux, was present only at the contaminant level. The technique demonstrates that thermal decomposition of the incongruently melting phase LiBa 2 B 5 O 10 can be used to grow â-BaB 2 O 4...|$|E
