25|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} operation used to cut keyways into shafts. Electron beam machining (EBM) is a machining process where high-velocity electrons are directed toward a work piece, creating heat and vaporizing the material. Ultrasonic machining uses ultrasonic vibrations to machine very hard or <b>brittle</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|E
25|$|Maximum Principal Stress Theory – by W.J.M Rankine(1850). Yield {{occurs when}} the largest {{principal}} stress exceeds the uniaxial tensile yield strength. Although this criterion allows for a quick and easy comparison with experimental data it is rarely suitable for design purposes. This theory gives good predictions for <b>brittle</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|E
25|$|Solids, liquids, and gases have stress fields. Static fluids support {{normal stress}} but will flow under shear stress. Moving viscous fluids can support shear stress (dynamic pressure). Solids can support both shear and normal stress, with ductile {{materials}} failing under shear and <b>brittle</b> <b>materials</b> failing under normal stress. All materials have temperature dependent variations in stress-related properties, and non-Newtonian materials have rate-dependent variations.|$|E

50|$|The {{toughness}} of a <b>brittle</b> <b>material</b> {{is typically}} twice the surface energy {{associated with the}} formation of the fracture surfaces.|$|R
25|$|Materials {{are limited}} to ductile {{materials}} because the threads are cold formed. However, this increases the thread's yield strength, surface finish, hardness, and wear resistance. Also, materials with good deformation characteristics are necessary for rolling; these materials include softer (more ductile) metals and exclude <b>brittle</b> <b>materials,</b> such as cast iron. Tolerances are typically ±0.001in. (±0.025mm), but tolerances as tight as ±0.0006in (±0.015mm) are achievable. Surface finishes range from 6 to 32 micro-inches.|$|E
25|$|Routing {{and milling}} are conceptually similar, and end mills {{can be used}} in routers, but routing wood is {{different}} from milling metal in terms of the mechanics involved; the chip formation is different, and the optimal tool geometry is thus different. Routing is properly applied to relatively weak and <b>brittle</b> <b>materials,</b> typically wood. As these materials are weak in small sections, routers may be run at extremely high speeds and so even a small router may cut rapidly. Owing to inertia at these high speeds, the normal wood cutting mechanism of Type I chips cannot take place. The cutter edge angle is blunt, approaching 90°, and so a Type III chip is formed, with the waste material being produced as fine dust. This dust is a respiratory hazard, even in benign materials. The forces against the cutter are light, so routers may be hand-held.|$|E
2500|$|Statistical {{studies of}} the {{strength}} of ceramics. The strength of <b>brittle</b> <b>materials</b> such as ceramics is inherently variable. Fulmer undertook numerous strength tests on sets of nominally identical specimens of engineering ceramics such as silicon nitride and silicon carbide. [...] They devised graphical techniques for finding the probability distribution of test results and contributed to criteria for engineering design with these materials.|$|E
5000|$|The {{algorithm}} {{for obtaining}} the right solution is simple. Compute the reinforcement ratios of each possible solution that fulfills the conditions. Further ignore solutions with a reinforcement ratio less than zero. Compute {{the values of}} [...] + [...] + [...] and select the solution for which this value is smallest. The principal stresses in the <b>brittle</b> <b>material</b> can be computed as the eigenvalues of the <b>brittle</b> <b>material</b> stress tensor, for example by Jacobi's method.|$|R
50|$|The UTS is {{a common}} {{engineering}} parameter to design members made of <b>brittle</b> <b>material</b> because such materials have no yield point.|$|R
50|$|This can be {{interpreted}} as the stress tensor of the composite material minus the stresses carried by the reinforcement at yielding. This formulation is accurate for reinforcement ratio's smaller than 5%. It is assumed that the <b>brittle</b> <b>material</b> has no tensile strength. (In case of reinforced concrete this assumption is necessary because the concrete has small shrinkage cracks.) Therefore, the principal stresses of the <b>brittle</b> <b>material</b> need to be compression. The principal stresses of a stress tensor are its eigenvalues.|$|R
2500|$|Strength of {{materials}} {{is defined as}} the maximum stress that can be endured before fracture occurs. Strength of biomaterials (bioceramics) is an important mechanical property because they are brittle. In <b>brittle</b> <b>materials</b> like bioceramics, cracks easily propagate when the material is subject to tensile loading, [...] unlike compressive loading. A number of methods are available for determining the tensile strength {{of materials}}, such as the bending flexural test, the biaxial flexural strength test and the weibull approach. In bioceramics, flaws influence the reliability and strength of the material during implantation and fabrication. There are a number of ways that flaws can be produced in bioceramics such as thermal sintering and heating. The importance is for bioceramics to have high reliability, [...] rather than high strength.|$|E
60|$|Time and {{practice}} did wonders for the physician. He was naturally humane, but possessed of no small share of moral courage; or, in other words, he was chary {{of the lives}} of his patients, and never tried uncertain experiments on such members of society as were considered useful; but, once or twice, when a luckless vagrant had come under his care, he was a little addicted to trying the effects of every phial in his saddle-bags on the strangers constitution. Happily their number was small, and in most cases their natures innocent. By these means Elnathan had acquired a certain degree of knowledge in fevers and agues, and could talk with judgment concerning intermittents, remittents, tertians, quotidians, etc. In certain cutaneous disorders very prevalent in new settlements, he was considered to be infallible; and there was no woman on the Patent but would as soon think of becoming a mother without a husband as without the assistance of Dr. Todd. In short, he was rearing, on this foundation of sand a superstructure cemented by practice, though composed of somewhat <b>brittle</b> <b>materials.</b> He however, occasionally renewed his elementary studies, and, with the observation of a shrewd mind, was comfort ably applying his practice to his theory.|$|E

50|$|A {{material}} is brittle if, when subjected to stress, it breaks without significant plastic deformation. <b>Brittle</b> <b>materials</b> absorb relatively little energy prior to fracture, {{even those of}} high strength. Breaking is often accompanied by a snapping sound. <b>Brittle</b> <b>materials</b> include most ceramics and glasses (which do not deform plastically) and some polymers, such as PMMA and polystyrene. Many steels become brittle at low temperatures (see ductile-brittle transition temperature), depending on their composition and processing.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDynamic crack-branching instabilities in a <b>brittle</b> <b>material</b> are studied numerically {{by using}} a non-local damage model. PMMA is taken as our model <b>brittle</b> <b>material.</b> The {{simulated}} crack patterns, crack velocities, and dissipated energies compare favorably with experimental data gathered from the literature, {{as long as the}} critical strain for damage initiation as well as the parameters for a rate-dependent damage law are carefully selected. Nonetheless, the transition from a straight crack propagation to the emergence of crack branches is very sensitive to the damage initiation threshold. The transition regime is thus a particularly interesting challenge for numerical approaches. We advocate using the present numerical study as a benchmark to test the robustness of alternative non-local numerical approaches. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
