40|$|The {{impact of}} no-till {{cropping}} systems with plant cover on soil macrofauna communities was assessed {{according to their}} abundance and biomass. The study {{was carried out in}} northeastern Thailand under a conventional cropping system (plow-based tillage), no-till cropping systems with plant cover (Brachiaria ruziziensis, Stylosanthes guianensis, S. guianensis associated with B. ruziziensis, rice straw) and under a natural dipterocarp forest. Soil macrofauna populations were sampled in 2007 (June and October) during the rainy season and at a beginning of the dry season, respectively. The results revealed that in the short term, the biological compartment responded quickly to the presence of plant cover, as shown by a significant increase in soil macrofauna abundance and total biomass. The highest mean total abundance (MTA) of 4224 individuals/m 2 at the end of planting period (October 2007) was observed under <b>S.</b>  guianensis <b>cover</b> and also the highest mean total soil macrofauna biomass (MTB) of 14. 63  g/m 2 was observed in the forest system in the same period.
