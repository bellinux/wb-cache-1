40|$|International audienceIt {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that whistler-mode waves can be trapped in plasmaspheric whistler ducts which guide the waves. For nonguided cases these waves {{are said to be}} "nonducted", which is dominant for L < 1. 6. Wave-particle interactions are affected by the wave being ducted or nonducted. In the field-aligned ducted case, first-order cyclotron resonance is dominant, whereas nonducted interactions open up a much wider range of energies through equatorial and off-equatorial resonance. There is conflicting information as to whether the most significant particle loss processes are driven by ducted or nonducted waves. In this study we use loss cone observations from the DEMETER and POES low-altitude satellites to focus on electron losses driven by powerful VLF communications transmitters. Both satellites confirm that there are well-defined enhancements in the flux of electrons in the drift loss cone due to ducted transmissions from the powerful transmitter with call sign NWC. Typically, ∼ 80 % of DEMETER nighttime orbits to the east of NWC show electron flux enhancements in the drift loss cone, spanning a L range consistent with first-order cyclotron theory, and inconsistent with nonducted resonances. In contrast, ∼ 1 % or less of nonducted transmissions originate from NPM-generated electron flux enhancements. While the waves originating from these two transmitters have been predicted to lead to similar levels of pitch angle scattering, we find that the enhancements from NPM are at least 50 times smaller than those from NWC. This suggests that lower-latitude, nonducted VLF waves are much less effective in driving radiation <b>belt</b> <b>pitch</b> angle scattering...|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{from seven}} {{spacecraft}} in geosynchronous orbit are analyzed {{to determine the}} decay rate of the number density of the outer electron radiation belt prior to the onset of high-speed-stream-driven geomagnetic storms. Superposed-data analysis is used {{with a collection of}} 124 storms. When there is a calm before the storm, the electron number density decays exponentially before the storm with a 3. 4 -day e-folding time: beginning about 4 days before storm onset, the density decreases from ∼ 4 × 10 − 4 cm− 3 to ∼ 1 × 10 − 4 cm− 3. When there is not a calm before the storm, the number density decay is very small. The decay in the number density of radiation belt electrons is believed to be caused by pitch angle scattering of electrons into the atmospheric loss cone as the outer plasmasphere fills during the calms. This is confirmed by separately measuring the density decay rate for times when the outer plasmasphere is present or absent. While the radiation belt electron density decreases, the temperature of the electron radiation belt holds approximately constant, indicating that the electron precipitation occurs equally at all energies. Along with the number density decay, the pressure of the outer electron radiation belt decays, and the specific entropy increases. From the measured decay rates, the electron flux to the atmosphere is calculated, and that flux is 3 orders of magnitude less than thermal fluxes in the magnetosphere, indicating that the radiation <b>belt</b> <b>pitch</b> angle scattering is 3 orders weaker than strong diffusion. Energy fluxes into the atmosphere are calculated and found to be insufficient to produce visible airglow...|$|E

40|$|Using five {{spacecraft}} in geosynchronous orbit, plasmaspheric drainage plumes {{are located}} in the dayside magnetosphere and the measured pitch angle anisotropies of radiation belt electrons are compared duskward and dawnward of the plumes. Two hundred twenty‐six plume crossings are analyzed. It is found that the radiation belt anisotropy is systematically greater dawnward of plumes (before the electrons cross the plumes) than it is duskward of plumes (after the electrons have crossed the plumes). This change in anisotropy is attributed to pitch angle scattering of the radiation belt electrons during their passage through the plumes. A test database in the absence of plumes finds no equivalent change in the radiation belt anisotropy. The amount of pitch angle scattering by the plume is quantified, scattering times are estimated, and effective pitch angle diffusion coefficients within the plume are estimated. The pitch angle diffusion coefficients obtained from the scattering measurements are of the same magnitude as expected values for electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves at high electron energies (1. 5 [*]MeV); however, expected EMIC diffusion coefficients do not extend to pitch angles of 90 ° and would have difficulties explaining the observed isotropization of electrons. The pitch angle diffusion coefficients obtained from the scattering measurements are of the same magnitude as expected values for whistler mode hiss at lower electron energies (150 [*]keV). Outward radial transport of the radiation belt caused by the pitch angle scattering in the plume is discussed.

30|$|The {{importance}} of Pc 1 – 2 waves as responsible for relativistic electron precipitation into the high-latitude ionosphere has been recently shown with increasing observational evidence (Rodger et al. 2008; Clilverd et al. 2010; Blum et al. 2015).

In this regard, {{it is worth noting that}} a significant correlation between Pc 1 – 2 power and atmospheric parameters has been recently observed in statistical analyses at Terra Nova Bay (TNB) (Francia et al. 2015; Regi et al. 2016, 2017).|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{study the}} effect of {{electromagnetic}} ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves on the loss and pitch angle scattering of relativistic and ultrarelativistic electrons during the recovery phase of a moderate geomagnetic storm on 11 October 2012. The EMIC wave activity was observed in situ on the Van Allen Probes and conjugately on the ground across the Canadian Array for Real-time Investigations of Magnetic Activity throughout an extended 18 h interval. However, neither enhanced precipitation of 3 ̆e 0. 7 MeV electrons nor reductions in Van Allen Probe 90 ° pitch angle ultrarelativistic electron flux were observed. Computed radiation <b>belt</b> electron <b>pitch</b> angle diffusion rates demonstrate that rapid pitch angle diffusion is confined to low pitch angles and cannot reach 90 °. For the first time, from both observational and modeling perspectives, we show evidence of EMIC waves triggering ultrarelativistic (2 - 8 MeV) electron loss but which is confined to pitch angles below around 45 ° and not affecting the core distribution. Key Points EMIC wave activity is not associated with precipitation of MeV electrons EMIC waves do not deplete the ultra-relativistic belt down to 90 ° EMIC waves cause loss of low pitch angle electrons with energies 2 - 8 MeV...|$|R

5000|$|When bassist Barry Carl {{decided to}} retire from the group to pursue other {{opportunities}} in 2002, Rockapella was left without a bass singer and needed {{to find a new}} one. The group was informed by a mutual friend that a [...] "true bass" [...] could be found in Baldi, but he was in Japan at the time. They sent him an email asking if he would come back to the U.S. and audition for the group. He was hired for the job in May 2002 and began to learn the group's song setlist. Baldi recorded his parts for Smilin', the group's 2002 summer album that served as a transition between Carl and Baldi singing bass, and his first concert as a member of Rockapella was on August 1, 2002 in Hartford, Connecticut at the East Hartford Town Green. Baldi's soft, smooth, resonant bass is a great contrast to Carl's, which seemed to rumble up from the depths of the earth, and his addition to the band started the evolution of Rockapella to their current R&B-based sound, or [...] "the new sound of Rockapella" [...] as the group refers to it as. He has sung many bass solos for Rockapella, taking over some of Carl's previous solos and singing his own unique solos in new original and cover music the group has included in their setlist over the years. Baldi's vocal range is vast, transitioning from low bass rumbling to high <b>pitched</b> <b>belting</b> with ease. In 2014, Baldi stepped aside from performing full-time with Rockapella and was replaced by Ryan Chappelle. Baldi remains as a supporting member to this day.|$|R

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringSafety of {{passengers}} in both automotive and aircraft is always looked upon for more advancement in providing better safety and minimizing the injuries/fatalities during crashes. Among the injuries which are incurred onto the occupants in aviation and automotive accidents, the head injuries {{are the most}} fatal and severe type of injury. In aircraft accidents, mostly {{in the event of}} air turbulence or emergency landing, the passengers seated behind bulkheads or interior walls have a higher chance of head impact onto these structures. Similarly, the vehicle safety is considered to be quiet important for automobile manufacturers as well as customers. Among all automobile crashes, frontal impact collisions are the most common types of crash scenario. The most observed injuries in these crashes are caused by the impact of the head to the steering wheel, windshield, etc. This thesis presents an investigation and development of response surface data on the Head Injury Criteria (HIC) during frontal crashes in both automotive and aircraft accidents. Consideration is made relative to the Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) for the aircraft industry and the US-NCAP (New Car Assessment Program) protocol for frontal impact crashes in automotive industry. For this purpose, a hybrid III 50 th percentile dummy is utilized in the occupant modeling code MADYMO to investigate the variations of the HIC with different parameters such as impact speed, impact angle, seat <b>belt</b> properties, seat <b>pitch</b> distances, and stiffness or material properties of the impact surface. Finally, a Design-of-Experiments (DOE) /Kriging model is utilized to generate response surface data on the HIC, using the sample results obtained from the MADYMO computer models. The collective results of the many simulations as surface plots from this study could be of significant use to the designers of automotive seats and aircraft interiors and in coming up with the most promising designs for occupant head impact protection in various frontal crash scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using oriented polymer {{technology in the}} design and manufacture of mechanical power transmission belts has been investigated. Working from an initial selection of polymers a die-drawing technique for orienting the polymers was devised, and the static and dynamic mechanical properties of the oriented polymers were investigated. These results indicated that PP, PBT, PPS and PEEK were suitable for further research. Of these 4 materials PBT was selected as the most appropriate material for belt manufacture based on cost, processability (drawing temperature, natural draw ratio) and limitations of laboratory equipment. A technique based on free-tensile drawing combined with simultaneous rotational motion was designed and used to manufacture oriented PBT flat belts from cylindrical injection moulded preforms. The technique used a tensile machine with two pulley-clamps, a fitted heated chamber and an electric motor to provide rotational motion to the belt during drawing. Two types of oriented PBT flat belts with different cross sections were produced successfully, termed 'thick' and 'thin'. These belts were tested on a purpose-built rig comprising two equal diameter pulleys, one driven by an electric motor and the other connected to a generator to provide load. The belt life and power transmission performance was investigated at various conditions of speed, transmitted torque and tension, and the results indicated that despite their smaller cross section 'thin' flat belts demonstrated up to 3 times longer life. However life was only 100 hours, which was very low compared with conventional flat belts that last for many thousands of hours at higher speeds and much greater power transmission capacity. Synchronous belts were then produced through the same manufacturing method used for flat belts. This aspect of the research concentrated on the initial pitch design and size, i. e. the timing. Initially a rectangular tooth profile was selected for its simplicity in terms of manufacture. The produced <b>belts</b> exhibited high <b>pitch</b> length variation as well as deformed teeth and were not usable for synchronous power transmission. An extra timing feature was included to control orientation; reducing the pitch length variation enabling consistent tooth production. It was observed that the areas between the extra timing feature and the tooth edges did not orient completely with some regions remaining undrawn. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used to predict the drawing behaviour of different shapes and dimensions of the timing features. The results suggested that a 4 mm wide and 7 mm long slot provided the highest possible extension and the minimum non-oriented regions on the groove. Whilst, the thickness and width of the drawn belt timing features showed differences to the FEA predictions, manufactured synchronous belts based on that design had much better controlled dimensions and the lowest achieved pitch length variation (± 1...|$|R
