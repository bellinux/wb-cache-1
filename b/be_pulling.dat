5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water and seemed to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to <b>be</b> <b>pulling</b> tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E

25|$|The fewer {{the number}} of combat-experienced {{divisions}} the British had left {{at the end of}} the war, the smaller Britain’s influence in Europe was likely to be, compared to the emerging superpowers of the USA and the USSR.

The 21st Army Group scarcely possessed sufficient forces to achieve such a military prominence, and the remaining divisions had to be expended sparingly.|$|E

The Union Cycliste Internationale later ruled that as Geox-TMC's licence application was incomplete, riders could freely leave the team and seek contracts with other teams. The squad's directeur sportif, Joxean Fernández Matxin, appealed to other companies for their backing, but later allowed the likes of Cobo and de la Fuente to search for new teams for the 2012 season.|$|E

Despite this, EDF Energy is still planning to build four new reactors at two sites, with public consultation completed and initial groundwork beginning on the first two reactors, sited at Hinkley Point in Somerset. Horizon Nuclear Power have plans for 4 to 6 new reactors at their sites, Wylfa and Oldbury. Three reactors are also in the works at the Moorside Nuclear Project. An agreement has also been made which allows for Chinese-designed reactors to be built {{on the site of the}} Bradwell nuclear power station.|$|E
500|$|Forces {{act in a}} {{particular}} direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as [...] "vector quantities". This means that forces follow {{a different set of}} mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could <b>be</b> <b>pulling</b> against each other as in tug of war or the two people could <b>be</b> <b>pulling</b> in the same direction. In this simple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other. Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems.|$|E

500|$|The {{second of}} the two main themes in the music video is of African American history and culture, {{as some of the}} {{vaudeville}} scenes in the short film acknowledge minstrel shows and blackface. Author W. T. Lhamon writes that the video is set in the Californian Depression, and that McCartney and Jackson [...] "convey a compactly corrupt history of blackface" [...] as they con their way to riches with the Mac and Jack show. Lhamon was critical of the pair and of the video because he felt that the African American theme had not been made explicitly known. The author expressed his view that aspects of the short film were historically out-of-synch with interracial relations. He stated, [...] "Nearly everything in the video is backward. Mack's white hand continually helping black Jack on board, for instance, reverses the general process I have shown of blacks providing whites with their sustaining gestures." [...] Lhamon added, [...] "In a just world, Jackson should <b>be</b> <b>pulling</b> McCartney onto the wagon, not the other way around." ...|$|E
500|$|Steph's {{relationships}} were {{a focal point}} of many reviews.

Grace Dent of The Guardian observed of her failed engagement to Fernando: [...] "With the best will in the world, I don't feel that marriage {{was ever going to}} last". Dent had previously named Steph singing the Sugababes' [...] "About You Now" [...] at Max's funeral one of her four favourite soap moments of 2008.
