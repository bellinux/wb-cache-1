5|$|First {{the hopeful}} note: There are faint signs the {{tinkering}} with Temperatures format {{could make the}} series funny later on, {{but only if the}} writing improves. The show now leaves most of the mugging to Lynde and no longer insists that each regular is wacky. It's all feeble stuff but the cast is vastly improved and the new approach portends to <b>better</b> <b>things</b> ahead.|$|E
5|$|There {{were five}} of them, a {{somewhat}} exceptional number: William P. Halliday, Samuel B. Halliday, Edwin W. Halliday, Henry L. Halliday, and Thomas W. Halliday. Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} they have always stood for <b>better</b> <b>things,</b> not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would have been better for the city and for them also, I have no doubt.|$|E
25|$|Both termini began life as fairly modest affairs, but {{in order}} to cope with {{increasing}} demands both went on to much bigger and <b>better</b> <b>things</b> in later years, a new Potsdamer Bahnhof, destined to be Berlin's busiest station, opening on 30 August 1872 and a new Anhalter Bahnhof, destined to be the city's biggest and finest, following on 15 June 1880. This latter station benefitted greatly from the closure of a short-lived third terminus in the area– the Dresdner Bahnhof, located south of the Landwehrkanal, which lasted from 17 June 1875 until 15 October 1882.|$|E

The film was co-directed by Chris Renaud of the Despicable Me series, {{and was released}} on July 8, 2016. It grossed over $875 million worldwide and a sequel is in development for June 2019. C.K. developed the series <b>Better</b> <b>Things</b> with its star Pamela Adlon, who had appeared on Louie. C.K. co-wrote, co-produced, and directed the pilot. The show is about a single working actress mother and her struggles to raise three daughters. It premiered in September 2016 on FX. His stand-up special 2017 was filmed in Washington, D.C. and released on April 4, 2017, through the streaming service Netflix. C.K.'s next stand-up special is slated for similar distribution.|$|E
25|$|Amsterdam Liberal Party (VVD) {{council member}} Hans Gruijters refused {{to attend the}} wedding {{reception}} ("I've got <b>better</b> <b>things</b> to do"), and later criticised the police actions against the protesters. The royalist VVD leadership reprimanded him, after which Gruijters discontentedly left the party. Together with Hans van Mierlo, Erik Visser, Peter Baehr and others, he {{decided it was time}} for political innovation. In the political programme of the new party D'66, founded on 14 October 1966, the need for 'radical democratisation' is discussed, meaning 'the voter directly chooses his government' and 'standards of democratic expediency should determine the form of government—monarchy or republic.' However, the party explained that 'the reason to change the form of government is currently not present', although it did seek to end the king's rol in the cabinet formation.|$|E
25|$|The Jardín del Arte Sullivan (literally Sullivan Garden of Art) is {{an outdoor}} art market {{which takes place}} every Sunday near the {{historic}} center of Mexico City in a neighborhood called Colonia San Rafael. This market began in the 1950s, when young artists who could not show their works in traditional galleries and shows decided to set {{up in front of}} their studios and in local parks to exhibit and sell their work. A number began to do so {{at the base of the}} Monumento a la Madre (Monument to Mothers) at Sullivan Park and in 1959, the Asociación Jardín del Arte, a non profit civil association was established affiliated with the Instituto Nacional de la Juventud Mexicana. Since then the market has shown works by a number of artists who moved on to <b>better</b> <b>things</b> such as Rodolfo Morales, established a second and third art market in the San Ángel neighborhood and has grown to 700 members. However, the original San Rafael neighborhood has deteriorated since the 1950s, and this has had a negative impact on the original Jardín del Arte.|$|E

25|$|The {{presentation}} of the US report was accompanied by two speeches, one from Smith and one from Senator Isidor Rayner (Democrat, Maryland). Towards {{the end of his}} speech, Smith declared: The calamity through which we have just passed has left traces of sorrow everywhere; hearts have been broken and deep anguish unexpressed; art will typify with master hand its lavish contribution to the sea; soldiers of state and masters of trade will receive the homage which is their honest due; hills will be cleft in search of marble white enough to symbolize these heroic deeds, and, where kinship is the only tie that binds the lowly to the humble home bereft of son or mother or father, little groups of kinsfolk will recount, around the kitchen fire, the traits of human sympathy in those who went down with the ship. These are choice pictures in the treasure house of the affections, but even these will sometime fade; the sea is the place permanently to honor our dead; this should be the occasion for a new birth of vigilance, and future generations must accord to this event a crowning motive for <b>better</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1874, Longfellow oversaw a 31-volume {{anthology}} called Poems of Places which collected poems representing several geographical locations, including European, Asian, and Arabian countries. Emerson {{was disappointed}} and reportedly told Longfellow: [...] "The world is expecting <b>better</b> <b>things</b> of you than this... You are wasting time {{that should be}} bestowed upon original production". In preparing the volume, Longfellow hired Katherine Sherwood Bonner as an amanuensis.|$|E
500|$|Johan Ludvig Heiberg, a {{prominent}} Hegelian, at first criticized the aesthetic section, Either (Part I), {{then he had}} much <b>better</b> <b>things</b> to say about Or, Part II. Julie Watkin said [...] "Kierkegaard replied to Heiberg in The Fatherland as Victor Eremita, blaming Heiberg for not reading the preface to Either/Or which would have given him {{the key to the}} work." [...] Kierkegaard later used his book Prefaces to publicly respond to Heiberg and Hegelianism. Kierkegaard and William Godwin were very similar in their criticism of critics. He also published a short article, Who is the Author of Either/Or?, a week after the publication of Either/Or itself.|$|E

500|$|Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{commented that the}} compilation [...] "proves that no other teen pop singer of her era has a better track record than Christina and if the new songs are any indication, {{the title of this}} hits comp is no lie either." [...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy noted the [...] "spunky attitude" [...] of the compilation and compared her recordings to those of Britney Spears: [...] "She may have started out with similar material to another Mickey Mouse Club alumnus, but Aguilera moved on to bigger and <b>better</b> <b>things</b> more quickly than Britney." [...] He further complimented Aguilera's songwriting skills.|$|E
500|$|In 1971, Culver {{played a}} {{supporting}} role in a low budget sexploitation thriller film, Ginger. While the film was a commercial and critical failure, Variety noted his performance positively, saying [...] "Only Calvin Culver...shows any indication of <b>better</b> <b>things</b> to come." [...] This in turn led to an offer to appear in Casey, a gay pornographic film in which Culver played the title role, a gay man who is visited by his fairy godmother Wanda (Culver playing a dual role in drag), and is granted a series of wishes which make him sexually irresistible to other men. Culver later took the character's name, Casey, {{and that of the}} popular Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan to create the pseudonym under which he would appear in all his other erotic roles.|$|E
500|$|However, {{she became}} {{dissatisfied}} with Cochrane, who was openly committing adultery and constantly insulting Gardnerians, even {{at one point}} calling for [...] "a Night of the Long Knives of the Gardnerians", at which point Valiente openly criticised him and then left his Clan. In her own words, she [...] "rose up and challenged him {{in the presence of}} the rest of the coven. I told him that I was fed up with listening to all this senseless malice, and that, if a 'Night of the Long Knives' was what his sick little soul craved, he could get on with it, but he could get on with it alone, because I had <b>better</b> <b>things</b> to do". Shortly after, Cochrane committed ritual suicide on Midsummer 1966; she authored the poem [...] "Elegy for a Dead Witch" [...] in his memory. She remained in contact with his widow and other members of the Clan, as well as with Gray, and proceeded to work on occasion with The Regency, a group founded by former members of the Clan.|$|E

500|$|After filming for The Seven Year Itch {{wrapped in}} November, Monroe began a new battle for control over her career and left Hollywood for the East Coast, {{where she and}} {{photographer}} Milton Greene founded their own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP)– an action that has later been called [...] "instrumental" [...] {{in the collapse of}} the studio system. Announcing its foundation in a press conference in January 1955, Monroe stated that she was [...] "tired of the same old sex roles. I want to do <b>better</b> <b>things.</b> People have scope, you know." [...] She asserted that she was no longer under contract to Fox, as the studio had not fulfilled its duties, such as paying her the promised bonus for The Seven Year Itch. This began a year-long legal battle between her and the studio. The press largely ridiculed Monroe for her actions and she was parodied in The Seven Year Itch writer George Axelrod's Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1955), in which her lookalike Jayne Mansfield played a dumb actress who starts her own production company.|$|E

Everyone is working round the clock, showing up at every call, and the Chief is acting like a maniacal overlord." [...] Krill also enjoyed Oh's performance as Yang, writing: [...] "Cristina dealing with children is almost laughable – and actually provides a chuckle or two in this tense episode. Miss C thinks she is striking gold by moving to peds, because she {{will be able to do}} all types of surgery, and on little people, which makes the surgery harder, which is of course, <b>better.</b> <b>Things</b> don't turn out as planned, though, when she realizes kids are a little more resilient than their adult counterparts. And then Callie outs her to Arizona – in the she doesn’t really like kids sense of outing." [...] Krill enjoyed Wilson's performance as Bailey, in addition to Dane's, writing: [...] "He wins the best line of the show with 'That’s how I know my job is safe, Yang – I reattach babies arms.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Kylie and Becky's {{characterisation}} and backstory are similar. Lane felt it {{was important}} to portray certain differences between the two. This was to prevent the audience becoming bored through repetition. This was done through Kylie making the opposite choice Becky would make. In April2011 Lane further described her as [...] "volatile" [...] because [...] "you never know what she'll do next." [...] Kylie proved to be unpredictable. Lane admitted it was fun to play her because [...] "It's difficult to imagine how she will react to things." [...] Through her relationships she is shown to be a [...] "" [...] who wants to have fun and has [...] "the bottle for anything." [...] One of Kylie's main motivations in life is money and she develops a taste for <b>better</b> <b>things</b> in life. Lane also predicted that Kylie would do anything [...] "if the price was right." [...] Lane opined that everyone's perception of Kylie is [...] "she's conniving and only out for what she can get." [...] Kylie gained such a reputation as a trouble-maker that Lane was often asked by members of the public to behave herself. Lane describes Kylie's redeeming qualities the fact she is [...] "bright and she's a grafter." ...|$|E

500|$|Having {{given up}} {{his pursuit of}} Skarginska, Bax {{returned}} to England; in January 1911 he married the pianist Elsita Luisa Sobrino (b. 1885 or 1886), daughter of the teacher and pianist, Carlos Sobrino, and his wife, Luise, née Schmitz, a singer. Bax and his wife lived first in Chester Terrace, Regent's Park, London, and then moved to Ireland, taking a house in Rathgar, a well-to-do suburb of Dublin. They had two children, Dermot (1912–1976) and Maeve Astrid (1913–1987). [...] Bax became known in Dublin literary circles under the pseudonym [...] "Dermot O'Byrne"; he mixed with the writer George William Russell and his associates, and published stories, verses and a play. Reviewing a selection of the prose and poetry reissued in 1980, Stephen Banfield found most of Bax's earlier poems [...] "like his early music, over-written, cluttered with the secondhand lumber of early Yeats, though the weakness is one of loosely chosen language rather than complexity." [...] Banfield had <b>better</b> <b>things</b> to say of the later poems, where Bax [...] "focuses matters, whether laconically and colloquially upon the grim futility of the 1916 Easter Uprising... or pungently upon his recurrent disillusionment about love." [...] Some of Bax's writings as O'Byrne were regarded as subversively sympathetic to the Irish republican cause, and the government censor prohibited their publication.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its initial release, Don't Look Now was {{generally}} well received by critics, although some criticised it for being [...] "arty and mechanical". Jay Cocks for Time, wrote that [...] "Don't Look Now is such a rich, complex and subtle experience that it demands more than one viewing", while Variety commented that the film's visual flourishes made it [...] "much more than merely a well-made psycho-horror thriller". Pauline Kael writing for The New Yorker was more reserved in her praise, considering the film to be [...] "the fanciest, most carefully assembled enigma yet put on the screen" [...] but that there was a [...] "distasteful clamminess about the picture", while Gordon Gow of Films and Filming felt that it fell short of the aspirations of Nicolas Roeg's previous two films, Performance and Walkabout, but it was nevertheless a thriller of some depth. Vincent Canby, reviewer for The New York Times, on the other hand, criticised the film for a lack of suspense which he put down to a twist that comes halfway through rather than at the end, and at which point it [...] "stops being suspenseful and becomes an elegant travelogue that treats us to second-sightseeing in Venice". Canby also suggested that second sight was not convincing on screen, since it appeared simply like flash-forward which is a standard story-telling device in films, and concluded that [...] "Not only do you probably have <b>better</b> <b>things</b> to do, but so, I'm sure, do most of the people connected with the film." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Bailey, in {{his study}} [...] "White Collars, Gray Lives" [...] (1999), traces the {{beginnings}} of literary interest in the lower-middle classes to the [...] "disquieting irruption of {{a new breed of}} petty bourgeois shop and office workers" [...] that faced Victorian writers {{in the last quarter of}} the 19th century. The Grossmiths' Diary was a typical satire of its time; it probed the lower-middle class lives of the Pooters and poked fun at their pretensions and petty concerns. Tony Joseph calls the Diary [...] "a sharp analysis of social insecurity". Although many writers had themselves come from humble backgrounds, they often sought to disguise their origins through scorn: [...] "putting the boot in on the lower middle classes", says Bailey, [...] "has long been the intellectual's blood sport". However, the quarter-century following the publication of The Diary of a Nobody saw a tendency to mix mockery with sympathy, even approval. In the works of writers such as George Gissing, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett and E. M. Forster, characters emerged who, despite the recognisably Pooterish aspects of their lives, were by no means entirely absurd. [...] Bennett and Wells could poke fun at figures such as [...] "Denry Machin", [...] "Mr Polly" [...] or [...] "Mr Lewisham", while at the same time celebrating their fortitude, energy and determination to look for <b>better</b> <b>things.</b> [...] In cases such as these, writes Bailey, [...] "disdain could change to admiration and national self-identification, as the Little Man... was transposed into Everyman, a model of cheerful resilience in times of crisis." ...|$|E
