A robust surface-wave migration requires the prior {{separation of the}} <b>back-scattered</b> surface-wave events from the data.

We mitigate this problem by using a super-virtual interferometric method to enhance and separate the <b>back-scattered</b> surface waves. The key idea is to calculate the virtual <b>back-scattered</b> surface waves by stacking the resulting virtual correlated and convolved traces associated with the incident and <b>back-scattered</b> waves. Stacking the virtual <b>back-scattered</b> surface waves improves their signal-to-noise ratio and separates the <b>back-scattered</b> surface-waves from the incident field.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{orientation}} of the ferroelectric (FE) domain structure of a BiFeO 3 epitaxial film was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using <b>back-scattered</b> electrons and piezoresponse-force microscopy (PFM). By changing the crystallographic {{orientation of}} the sample and the electron collection angle relative to the detector, we establish {{a link between the}} orientation of polarization vectors (out-of-plane and in-plane) in the BiFeO 3 film and the <b>back-scattered</b> electron image contrast in agreement with PFM investigations. The different FE polarization states in the domains correspond to altered crystalline environments for the impingent primary beam electrons. We postulate that the resultant <b>back-scattered</b> electron domain contrast arises as a result of either differential absorption (through a channelling effect) or through back-diffraction from the sample, which leads to a projected diffraction pattern super-imposed with the diffuse conventional <b>back-scattered</b> electron intensity.

These are due to the local variation of the volume density and of the compressibility of the medium. The theoretical approach for the derivation of the <b>back-scattered</b> field is based on Bloomfield generalization [1] of Jensen formalism [2]. The <b>back-scattered</b> signals are obtained by spatially convolving the spatial distribution of the inhomogeneity with the temporal auto-convolution function of the transmitted impulse response calculated.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that diffraction stack migration {{can be used}} to discover the distribution of near-surface faults. The methodology {{is based on the assumption}} that near-surface faults generate detectable <b>back-scattered</b> surface waves from impinging surface waves. We first isolate the <b>back-scattered</b> surface waves by muting or FK filtering, and then migrate them by diffraction migration using the surface wave velocity as the migration velocity. Instead of summing events along trial quasi-hyperbolas, surface wave migration sums events along trial quasi-linear trajectories that correspond to the moveout of <b>back-scattered</b> surface waves. We have also proposed a natural migration method that utilizes the intrinsic traveltime property of the direct and the <b>back-scattered</b> waves at faults. For the synthetic data sets and the land data collected in Aqaba, where surface wave velocity has unexpected perturbations, we migrate the <b>back-scattered</b> surface waves with both predicted velocity profiles and natural Green's function without velocity information. Because the latter approach avoids the need for an accurate velocity model in event summation, both the prestack and stacked migration images show competitive quality. Results with both synthetic data and field records validate the feasibility of this method.

50|$|The {{detection}} efficiency for electrons is essentially 100% for most scintillators. But because electrons can make large angle scatterings (sometimes backscatterings), they can exit the detector without depositing their full energy in it. The <b>back-scattering</b> is a rapidly increasing {{function of the}} atomic number Z of the scintillator material. Organic scintillators, having a lower Z than inorganic crystals, are therefore best suited {{for the detection of}} low-energy (< 10 MeV) beta particles. The situation is different for high energy electrons: since they mostly lose their energy by bremsstrahlung at the higher energies, a higher-Z material is better suited for the detection of the bremsstrahlung photon and the production of the electromagnetic shower which it can induce.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} answer these questions, it is of {{particular}} interest to investigate cosmic rays in the 1012 to 1015 eV region due to several theories predicting a change in elemental composition just below the knee. To determine the elemental spectrum of cosmic rays, CREAM uses a silicon charge detector, timing charge detector, and scintillating fiber hodoscopes to detect the charge of incident particles up to that of iron (Z = 26). Energies are measured with a transition radiation detector (TRD), along with an ionization calorimeter. Because all detectors are in close proximity of each other, it is a prime concern to minimize the interaction between showers produced in the calorimeter, and the charge-measuring instruments. To dampen this effect, CREAM uses a larger number of pixels with a smaller area, along with a very fast readout time to differentiate between events caused by the primary particle and events caused by <b>back-scattering</b> from the calorimeter.|$|E
50|$|Transmission Raman is {{possible}} because light scatters through turbid materials {{that do not}} significantly absorb or block the light. In a similar mechanism to Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy, the light in a diffusely scattering sample spreads through the object randomly (Transmission Raman {{can be regarded as}} an extreme example of SORS). As Raman photons can be created at all points that the light passes through the total scrambled Raman signal measured on the opposite face of the object is highly representative of the bulk of the material. This desirable property removes a problem with conventional, widely used <b>back-scattering</b> Raman spectroscopy where the signal tends to be representative of the surface and near-surface composition. Because Raman does not rely on absorption and the light spreads throughout the sample, a large thickness can be measured in the absence of photon absorption. This produces an analysis representative of the entire mixture and is typically insensitive to coatings, or thin containers.|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} an {{underwater}} image is degraded {{due to the}} effects of light scattering in water, which are resolution loss and contrast loss. Contrast loss is the main degradation problem in underwater images which is caused by the effect of optical <b>back-scatter.</b> A method is proposed to improve the contrast of an underwater image by mitigating the effect of optical <b>back-scatter</b> after image acquisition. The proposed method is based on the inverse model of an underwater image model, which is validated experimentally in this work. It suggests that the recovered image can be obtained by subtracting the intensity value due to the effect of optical <b>back-scatter</b> from the degraded image pixel and then scaling the remaining by a factor due to the effect of optical extinction. Three filters are proposed to estimate for optical <b>back-scatter</b> in a degraded image. Among these three filters, the performance of BS-CostFunc filter is the best. The physical model of the optical extinction indicates that the optical extinction can be calculated by knowing the level of optical <b>back-scatter.</b> Results from simulations with synthetic images and experiments with real constrained images in monochrome indicate that the maximum optical <b>back-scatter</b> estimation error is less than 5 %. The proposed algorithm can significantly improve the contrast of a monochrome underwater image. Results of colour simulations with synthetic colour images and experiments with real constrained colour images indicate that the proposed method is applicable to colour images with colour fidelity. However, for colour images in wide spectral bands, such as RGB, the colour of the improved images is similar to the colour of that of the reference images. Yet, the improved images are darker than the reference images in terms of intensity. The darkness of the improved images is because of the effect of noise on the level of estimation errors.
