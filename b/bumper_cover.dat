25|$|The SE gained {{standard}} {{cruise control}} and dual-zone climate control, and GTs got a standard power driver's seat and CD player. This {{was the last}} year of the two-door coupe. The SE model can be identified by a single exhaust pipe and different rear <b>bumper</b> <b>cover.</b> OnStar was now an option on the GTP.|$|E
25|$|OnStar, {{formerly}} unavailable on the Grand Prix, {{was made}} standard on GTP, optional only on GT. The SE got revised frontal styling {{in the form}} of the GT and GTP front <b>bumper</b> <b>cover</b> in place of the older SE-specific front fascia, standard rear spoiler, and in-trunk emergency release; manual dual-zone climate-control replaced the optional electronic automatic unit previously offered.|$|E
25|$|For 1974, a new {{rear bumper}} system {{replaced}} the squared tail and chrome rear bumper blades introduced in 1968 with a trim, tapering urethane cover carrying an integral license plate holder and recesses for the trademark round taillights. Underneath sat a box-section aluminum impact bar on two Omark-bolt slider brackets {{similar to the}} system used in the nose which allowed the Corvette to pass federal five-mph impact tests at the rear {{as well as the}} front. The new rear design was quite beautiful, and more up-to-date than the 60's shape that it replaced with the vast majority of enthusiasts embracing the new design. For the 1974 model only, casting limitations mandated left and right bumper covers with a vertical center seam. The anti-theft alarm key activator was moved from the rear panel to the front left fender. Tailpipes were now turned down as the new <b>bumper</b> <b>cover</b> eliminated the tailpipe extensions.|$|E
25|$|The Regal {{utilizes}} unibody construction with {{galvanized steel}} front fenders, hood, roof and door panels and thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) <b>bumper</b> <b>covers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The same {{front and}} rear fascias (<b>bumper</b> <b>covers)</b> for the GT/CS were used on the Shelby GT-H and Shelby GT (see 2006-2007 Shelby GT-H).|$|R
5000|$|There {{was a minor}} refresh of {{the design}} between the 2003 and 2004 model years which {{affected}} {{the front and rear}} <b>bumper</b> <b>covers,</b> hood and head lights. On the interior, a small center console replaced the driver's arm rest and the rear seats got adjustable head rests.|$|R
2500|$|It {{was heard}} during the draw for an IROC race {{a few years}} back that they called the color of one of the cars [...] "Evans Orange." [...] That car carried a small [...] "61" [...] on the <b>bumper</b> <b>cover</b> in the same font used on Richie's last race cars. [...] Ray Evernham, Jr. raced against Richie in the Modifieds and also wrote the {{foreword}} in the [...] "Richie! The Richie Evans Story" [...] by Bones Bourcier; he also worked on them at the IROC shops in his native New Jersey and was involved with that aspect.|$|E
2500|$|In 1974, a [...] {{rear bumper}} {{system with a}} two-piece, {{tapering}} urethane <b>bumper</b> <b>cover</b> replaced the Kamm-tail and chrome bumper blades, and matched the new front design from the previous year. 1975 was {{the last year for}} the convertible, (which did not return for 11 years) and Dave McLellan succeeded Zora Arkus-Duntov as the Corvette's Chief Engineer. For the 1976 models the fiberglass floor was replaced with steel panels to provide protection from the catalytic converter's high operating temperature. For 15 model years the names Corvette, Sting Ray, and Stingray were synonymous. 1977 was last year the tunneled roof treatment with vertical back window was used, in addition leather seats were available at no additional cost for the first time. The black exterior color returned after a six-year absence.|$|E
2500|$|As well {{as being}} sold in the North American market, third-generation models were {{imported}} to many other countries, in left and right-hand drive configurations. However, this action proved unsuccessful. Exported models wore Mercury Sable headlamps, a unique front <b>bumper</b> <b>cover</b> to conform to these countries' regulations regarding automotive lighting. Right-hand-drive versions used a hand-operated parking brake in the center console instead of a foot-operated parking brake as in North America. Australians tended {{to stay away from}} the cars, due to their high price; a well-equipped, larger-engined rear-wheel drive Ford Fairmont cost around the same amount. Australian buyers could only opt for a single-spec sedan, known as the Taurus Ghia. However, in New Zealand the Taurus was quite popular. Whereas Australia only saw the 1996 model, both the sedan and station wagon models were sold in New Zealand from 1996-1998.|$|E
50|$|Bumpers are {{increasingly}} being designed to mitigate injury to pedestrians struck by cars, such as {{through the use of}} <b>bumper</b> <b>covers</b> made of flexible materials. Front bumpers, especially, have been lowered and made of softer materials, such as foams and crushable plastics, to reduce the severity of impact on legs.|$|R
2500|$|Moldings, <b>bumpers,</b> wheel <b>covers</b> {{and door}} handles in chrome {{finishing}} ...|$|R
50|$|For 1986, Honda updated the CRX {{with new}} {{aerodynamic}} headlights. The Si received body color matched lower cladding, a revised rear spoiler, new <b>bumper</b> <b>covers</b> and 14-inch alloy wheels. The interior was upgraded {{and added a}} center console with cassette tape storage. 1987 was virtually unchanged from 1986 and would be {{the final year of}} the first generation CRX.|$|R
2500|$|Styling changed subtly {{throughout}} the generation until 1978 for the car's 25th anniversary. The Sting Ray nameplate {{was not used}} on the 1968 model, but Chevrolet still referred to the Corvette as a Sting Ray; however, the 1969 (through 1976) models used the [...] "Stingray" [...] name as one word, without the space. In 1970, the body design was updated including fender flares, and interiors were refined, which included redesigned seats, and indication lights near the gear shift that were an early use of fiber optics [...] Due to government regulation, the 1973 Corvette's chrome front bumper was changed to a system with a urethane <b>bumper</b> <b>cover.</b> 1973 Corvettes are unique in that sense, as {{they are the only}} year where the front bumper was polyurethane and the rear retained the chrome two-piece bumper set. 1973 was also the last year chrome bumpers were used. The optional wire-spoked wheel covers (left) were offered for the last time in 1973. Only 45 Z07 were built in 1973. From 1974 onwards both the front and rear bumpers were polyurethane.|$|E
2500|$|... 1973 started Corvette's {{transformation}} from muscle to touring sports car. A Chevrolet advertisement headlined: [...] "We gave it radials, a quieter ride, guard beams and a nose job." [...] Indeed, redesigned body mounts and radial tires did improve Corvette's ride, and interior sound levels were reduced by 40%. The chrome rear bumper was essentially carried {{over from the}} previous year. However, the chrome blade front bumper was dropped for the federally required [...] standard for a light-weight front bumper system with an inner transverse tube attached to the frame with two Omark-bolts-(special steel fasteners which absorbed energy when a forming die, pushed back by the bumper, was forced down their length), and an injection-molded urethane <b>bumper</b> <b>cover.</b> The urethane nose was chosen over Chevy's other alternative, a more protruding version of the previous metal bumper. The new urethane bumper assembly added thirty-five pounds to the front end. Two [...] small block engines were available. The base L-48 engine produced [...] The L-82 was introduced as the optional high performance small-block engine (replacing the LT-1 engine) and delivered [...] The new hydraulic lifter motor featured a forged steel crankshaft, running in a four-bolt main block, with special rods, impact extruded pistons, a higher lift camshaft, mated to special heads with larger valves running at a higher 9:1 compression, and included finned aluminum valve covers to help dissipate heat. The L-82 was designed to come on strong at higher RPM and ordered with nearly 20% of the cars {{at a cost of}} $299.|$|E
2500|$|... 1976 models {{featured}} steel {{floor panels}} shielding the catalytic converter exhaust. These steel floor panels weighed {{less than the}} previous fiberglass floor and reduced interior noise levels. Horsepower rose to [...] for the base L-48 engine; [...] for the optional L-82. To further reduce cabin noise levels, cowl induction was dropped {{in favor of the}} air cleaner ducted over the radiator, picking up outside air {{from the front of the}} car, thus reducing wind turbulence at the base of the windshield. The hood was carried over, with its cowl vent grille and induction system opening becoming non-functional. The optional cast aluminum wheels were finally made available, which reduced the unsprung weight of the car by 32pounds. Nearly 15% of the cars were ordered with the new wheels at a cost of $299. A standard steel rim spare was used. This was the last year for optional white striped tires, as 86% of the cars were being delivered with the optional white lettered tires. A new rear nameplate for the rear <b>bumper</b> <b>cover</b> was introduced, eliminating the individual [...] "Corvette" [...] letters used since 1968. An unwelcome change was the [...] "Vega GT" [...] 4-spoke steering wheel, although its smaller diameter did provide extra room and eased entry/exit. The steering wheel, color-keyed to the interior, continued on 1977 through 1979 models, limited to non-tilt wheel cars only. GM's [...] "Freedom" [...] battery, a new sealed and maintenance-free unit, was now installed in all cars. The rear window defroster option was changed from the forced-air type of previous years to the new [...] "Electro-Clear" [...] defogger, an in-glass heated element type. Even without a convertible model, the Corvette still set new sales records.|$|E
50|$|In 1973, {{the front}} bumper was {{enlarged}} {{in accordance with}} new NHTSA standards, and all Mustang models had their sportlamps changed to a vertical orientation {{at each end of}} the grille. As the new <b>bumper</b> <b>covered</b> part of the front valance (and therefore the previous turn signal location), the sportlamps also served as turn signals. Both a Mach 1 and base grille were offered, with differing insert patterns.|$|R
5000|$|... 1973 {{brought some}} mild restyling. The {{urethane}} front bumper became standard, and was enlarged {{in accordance with}} new NHTSA standards. All Mustang models had their sportlamps re-purposed as turn signals, as the new <b>bumper</b> <b>covered</b> part of the front valance (and therefore the previous turn signal location). These new lamps - unlike their 1971/72 counterparts - were now oriented vertically. Both a Mach 1 and base grille were offered, with differing insert patterns.|$|R
25|$|American Motors was {{evaluating}} the Pacer as compact personal luxury model with the Crown Pacer concept {{car that was}} first shown at the 1978 Chicago Auto Show. Finished in all white with a white interior, the Crown Pacer included numerous features such as a large inbuilt sun roof, real wire wheels, full rocker panel bright trim, as well as color matched integrated flexible front and fear fascia and <b>bumper</b> <b>covers</b> with black rubber guards and impact (nerf) strips.|$|R
2500|$|Mazda {{introduced}} the 10th Anniversary RX-7 in 1988 as a {{limited production run}} based on the RX-7 Turbo II. Production was limited to 1,500 models. The 10th Anniversary RX-7 features a Crystal White (paint code UC) monochromatic paint scheme with matching white body side mouldings, taillight housings, mirrors and 16-inch alloy 7-spoke wheels. There were two [...] "series" [...] of 10th Anniversary models, with essentially a VIN-split running production change between the two. The most notable difference between the series {{can be found on}} the exterior- the earlier [...] "Series I" [...] cars had a black [...] "Mazda" [...] logo decal on the front <b>bumper</b> <b>cover,</b> whereas most if not all [...] "Series II" [...] cars did not have the decal. Series II cars also received the lower seat cushion height/tilt feature that Series I cars lacked. Another distinctive exterior feature is the bright gold rotor-shaped 10th Anniversary Edition badge on the front fenders (yellow-gold on the Series II cars). A distinctive 10th Anniversary package feature is the all black leather interior (code D7), which included not just the seats, but the door panel inserts as well and a leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel (with 10th Anniversary Edition embossed horn button) and MOMO leather shift knob with integrated boot. All exterior glass is bronze tinted (specific in North America to only the 10th Anniversary), and the windshield was equipped with the embedded secondary antenna also found on some other select models with the upgraded stereo packages. Other 10th Anniversary Edition specific items were headlight washers (the only RX-7 in the US market that got this feature), glass breakage detectors added to the factory alarm system, 10th Anniversary Edition logoed floormats, 10th Anniversary Edition embroidered front hood protector and accompanying front end mask (or [...] "bra"), and an aluminum under pan.|$|E
50|$|Drivers {{complained that}} the front <b>bumper</b> <b>cover</b> does not have {{adequate}} ground clearance to clear a curb in a parking space. In addition to scratching the cover, if the driver drives the Jetta too far forward into a parking space, the <b>bumper</b> <b>cover</b> would {{have a tendency to}} hook onto the curb like a barb, and as the driver backs out of the parking space, the entire front <b>bumper</b> <b>cover</b> would be torn off the vehicle. In the US, a class action lawsuit regarding this problem was filed in 2009, and a settlement was reached awarding owners a $140 reimbursement for repair costs.|$|E
50|$|The GXP has an upgraded, Nürburgring-tuned FE3 {{suspension}} package, {{as well as}} larger, ventilated Brembo disc brakes. It {{also features}} a unique front <b>bumper</b> <b>cover</b> and a rear (non-functional) diffuser to differentiate it from the standard Sedan and GT models.|$|E
50|$|The Verano is {{essentially}} a North American-market version of the Chinese-market compact Buick Excelle. The Verano's unibody construction utilizes galvanized steel for its front fenders, hood, roof and door panels and thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) <b>bumper</b> <b>covers.</b> It incorporates acoustical laminated glass, triple door seals, a five-layer interior roof liner, sound absorbing mats, recycled denim insulation and specially manufactured 18-inch forged alloy wheels, which minimize road noise. Buick's VentiPorts reappeared at the Verano's introduction, a styling feature unique to Buick dating back to 1949.|$|R
25|$|Neons had {{unconventional}} option availability, {{including the}} lack of power windows in the rear doors. Certain color base-model Neons, including red and black, had <b>bumper</b> <b>covers</b> molded in color rather than painted. These covers, while textured and not as glossy as paint, absorbed scuffs and scrapes with less visible damage. The mid-level Highline models in 95 & 96 used wheel covers with a bubble design. Initially, Neons were available in many bold colors including Nitro yellow-green, Lapis Blue, Aqua, and Magenta, however paint color choices became more subdued by the 1998-1999 model years, as the majority of buyers opted for more traditional colors.|$|R
5000|$|Cruise control, heated seats, {{automatic}} windshield wipers, HID headlights with headlight washers, heated exterior mirrors, glass moonroof and 17" [...] {{wheels are}} standard equipment. 18" [...] alloy wheels are standard on the lop level trim packages Comfort and Sport. The smart key {{is available only}} on the Sport or Comfort trim packages, coupled with the Harman/Kardon satellite navigation system and memory seats. The front hood (bonnet) and front <b>bumper</b> <b>covers</b> use the Japanese configuration, with turnsignal repeaters on the exterior mirrors, and standard equipment front and rear foglights. Japan and Europe are offered an exterior paint selection, called Dark Amethyst Silica that is not available in the UK or North America.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, the Thunderbird {{received}} some exterior updates. The front fascia saw substantial stylistic changes with larger air scoops in the <b>bumper</b> <b>cover,</b> new headlamps, and a new, slightly more curvaceous hood. At {{the center of}} this, the silver Thunderbird logo was moved onto the front <b>bumper</b> <b>cover</b> from the front lip of the hood where it was located previously. The Thunderbird's interior was completely redesigned {{with an emphasis on}} optimizing driver comfort and convenience to the utmost. The redesign featured a [...] "wrap around" [...] cockpit-style layout of instrumentation with a new steering wheel, radio, and climate controls and sweeping curves on the door panels and dashboard surfaces. Complementing the changes to the interior came added driver and passenger safety as Ford made dual front-side airbags standard on all 1994 Thunderbird models.|$|E
50|$|The SE gained {{standard}} {{cruise control}} and dual-zone climate control, and GTs got a standard power driver's seat and CD player. This {{was the last}} year of the two-door coupe. The SE model can be identified by a single exhaust pipe and different rear <b>bumper</b> <b>cover.</b> OnStar now an option on GTP.|$|E
50|$|OnStar, {{formerly}} unavailable on the Grand Prix, {{was made}} standard on GTP, optional only on GT. The SE got revised frontal styling {{in the form}} of the GT and GTP front <b>bumper</b> <b>cover</b> in place of the older SE-specific front fascia, standard rear spoiler, and in-trunk emergency release; manual dual-zone climate-control replaced the optional electronic automatic unit previously offered.|$|E
50|$|The {{front of}} the car had {{basically}} a rectangular cross section and was rounded {{all the way to the}} floor. The front <b>bumper</b> <b>covered</b> the rounded fenders, while the lower half of the lights was embedded in the front bonnet. The rear of the car had a continuous dropping form, and was divided by a vertical fin, which started at the rear end of the roof and ended almost at the rear end of the car. The rear wheels had aerodynamic covers. The door handles were embedded into the door panels, from which only the door hinges protruded slightly. The car had no rear window, limiting rear visibility to what could be discerned through slots on the sheet metal.|$|R
50|$|North American-spec 1974 Capris adopted large, federally {{mandated}} 5-mph bumpers at {{both the}} front and rear of the car. The <b>bumpers</b> were <b>covered</b> in body-colored plastic. The 2.6-liter Cologne V6 was replaced by a 2.8-liter Cologne V6 with revised castings for both the engine block and cylinder heads.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1996 model year, the {{exterior}} {{was given a}} significant facelift, similar to its MN12 cousin Ford Thunderbird. The front and rear <b>bumper</b> <b>covers,</b> headlights, grille, and moulding were updated, giving the car a more modern look. The 4.6-L engine received an updated composite intake manifold, giving the car [...] of additional torque over the 1995 model and the transmission was improved for increased reliability. The interior was given a minor update, which included a revised instrument cluster, much {{like that of the}} Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable of the time and a center console with cup holders. The ashtray and cigarette lighter were relocated to the space previously occupied by the information center, now integrated in the instrument cluster. Another anniversary edition car was built to commemorate 30 years.|$|R
5000|$|The SCX W41 coupe was {{introduced}} by Oldsmobile in 1991 and offered through 1993. It replaced the previous Cutlass Calais 442 W41 as the best handling, highest power output compact car in the Oldsmobile's lineup {{as well as being}} the last performance [...] "W-Machine" [...] Oldsmobile would offer. The SCX is a higher-performance version of the SC (sports coupe) and as such utilized the SC's deeper front <b>bumper</b> <b>cover</b> with standard fog lamps, lower body side cladding, rear <b>bumper</b> <b>cover</b> with dual exhaust tip cut-outs, as well as a unique W41-specific silver colored stripe around the lower body moldings, [...] "W41" [...] decals on the front fenders, and [...] "Achieva SCX" [...] decals at the leading edges of the doors. Other appearance changes for the SCX W41 package included the addition of a 140 mph speedometer in place of the standard 120 mph unit as well as a tachometer indicating the higher 7200 rpm red line.|$|E

5000|$|The Legacy SUS (short for [...] "Sport Utility Sedan") was {{launched}} {{with a limited}} production test run sold in USA in 1998 and, based on its success, was rolled out in North America only the following year. The [...] "Limited" [...] trim level package for the Outback wagon was standard equipment on the sedan body, {{with the addition of}} a hood scoop and trunk-mounted rear wing. Despite the appearance of the front hood scoop, the SUS was not installed with a turbocharged engine; the only engine installed from Subaru was the naturally-aspirated EJ25D engine. The [...] "SUS" [...] moniker was removed with the introduction of the Second Generation. Plastic side cladding was not present on the side doors of the Outback; the lower half of the doors were painted a contrasting color also found on the front and rear <b>bumper</b> <b>covers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Styling was {{up-to-date}} with sharply formed {{edges and}} large rectangular headlights. The front <b>bumper</b> <b>covered</b> only the corners, allowing the grill {{to be much}} more prominent than normal. The roof line terminated behind the large door on each side. Above the rear waistline were a pair of side hinged clam shell doors covering the entire rear section. An integrated roll bar terminated the body work and also formed a place for the clam shell doors to seal. The clam shell doors met each {{in the middle of the}} roof with no centre support. When the doors were raised you could stretch a tent between them. Two adults could sleep in the tent section and another two adults could sleep on the front seats, which could fold down flat. Finally, the rear section included a full width tail gate with a wind-down window nestled under the rear roll bar.|$|R
5000|$|Both GPS {{navigation}} {{systems can}} be displayed in a split screen format that shows both two- and three dimensions with graphic landmarks. Trim panels on the doors and the dashboard can be exchanged for an optional second woodgrain appearance or carbon fiber. The front and rear <b>bumper</b> <b>covers</b> can also be exchanged for Subaru designed aero-effects, allowing the buyer to install two types of mesh grilles, a choice of two front fog light selections, and a choice of oval or trapezoidal dual rear exhaust ports in chrome. A rear wiper is still available optionally {{on the back of}} the sedan, a tradition established with the first generation Legacy. The Warm Ivory interior color is only available on vehicles with the [...] "L" [...] package and SI-Cruise models; all other trim levels are available with black interior with black cloth upholstery, with leather offered optionally on the [...] "L" [...] package and SI-Cruise model.
