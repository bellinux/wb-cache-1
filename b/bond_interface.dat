This procedure allows also to analyze multiple layer bonds. The image contrast depends on the distance between the wafers. Usually if using monochromatic color IR the center of the wafers is display brighter based on the vicinity.

The post-bake process is applied at 180 to 320 °C for 30 to 240 min usually in a specific atmosphere or vacuum in the bond chamber. This is necessary to hard-cure the BCB. The vacuum prevents air trapped in the <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> and pumps out the gases of the out-gassing residual solvents during annealing. The temperature and the curing time are variable, so with a higher temperature curing time can be reduced based on a quicker cross-linking. The final bonding layer thickness depends on {{the thickness of the}} cured BCB, the spinning speed and the shrink rate.|$|E

5000|$|The {{electrical}} {{field intensity}} in the depletion region {{is so high}} that the oxygen ions drift to the <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> and pass out to react with the silicon to form SiO2 (compare to figure [...] "ion drifting in bond glass" [...] (2)). Based on the high field intensity in the depletion region or in the gap at the interface, both wafer surfaces are pressed together at a specific bond voltage and bond temperature. The process is realized at temperatures from 200 - 500 °C for about 5 to 20 min. Typically, the bonding or sealing time becomes longer when temperature and voltage are reduced. The pressure is applied to create intimate contact between the surfaces to ensure good electrical conduction across the wafer pair. This ensures intimate contact for the surfaces of the bonding partners. The thin formed oxide layer between the bond surfaces, siloxane (Si-O-Si), ensures the irreversible connection between the bonding partners.|$|E
5000|$|The process {{differs from}} {{diffusion}} bonding in which diffusion {{occurs when a}} melting point repressant element from an interlayer moves into lattice and grain boundaries of the substrates at the bonding temperature. Solid state diffusional processes lead to a change of composition at the <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> and the dissimilar interlayer melts at a lower temperature than the parent materials. Thus {{a thin layer of}} liquid spreads along the interface to form a joint at a lower temperature than the melting point of either of the parent materials. This method differs from brazing in that it is [...] "isothermally solidifying". While holding the temperature above the filler metal melting point, interdiffusion shifts the composition away from eutectic, so solidification occurs at the process temperature. If sufficient interdiffusion occurs, the joint will remain solid and strong well above the original melt process temperature. This is why it is termed [...] "transient liquid phase." [...] The liquid solidifies before cooling.|$|E

30|$|Thermal self-compressing bonding (TSCB) {{is a new}} {{solid-state}} bonding method {{pioneered by}} the authors. With electron beam as the non-melted heat source, previous experimental study performed on titanium alloys has proved the feasibility of TSCB. However, the thermal stress–strain process during bonding, which is of very important significance in revealing the mechanism of TSCB, was not analysed. In this paper, finite element analysis method is adopted to numerically study the thermal elasto-plastic stress–strain cycle of thermal self-compressing bonding. It is found that due to the localized heating, a non-uniform temperature distribution is formed during bonding, with the highest temperature existed on the <b>bond</b> <b>interface.</b> The expansion of high temperature materials adjacent to the <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> are restrained by surrounding cool materials and rigid restraints, and thus an internal elasto-plastic stress–strain field is developed by itself which makes the <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> subjected to thermal compressive action. This thermal self-compressing action combined with the high temperature on the <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> promotes the atom diffusion across the <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> to produce solid-state joints. Due to the relatively large plastic deformation, rigid restraint TSCB obtains sound joints in relatively short time compared to diffusion bonding.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, the shear-mode (Mode-II) {{fracture}} toughness of wood– wood and wood–fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) <b>bonded</b> <b>interfaces</b> using unique linear tapered end-notched flexure (TENF) specimens is evaluated. A tapered beam on elastic foundation (TBEF) model developed for design {{and analysis of}} the TENF specimens is briefly introduced. Based on the TBEF model, the TENF specimens are designed to achieve an approximate constant compliance rate change for fracture tests, and design procedures for Mode-II fracture of <b>bonded</b> <b>interface</b> are accordingly developed. The linear compliance rate changes of the designed TENF specimens are verified experimentally by the compliance calibration tests and numerically by finite element modeling. Two types of TENF specimens, namely for wood–wood and wood–FRP <b>bonded</b> <b>interfaces,</b> are designed and tested to determine the {{fracture toughness}} values of adhesively <b>bonded</b> <b>interfaces</b> under Mode-II loading. The critical loads for crack initiation and arrest are measured during the testing, in which the critical strain energy release rates are then easily evaluated by making use of the approximate constant compliance rate change of the designed specimens over defined crack lengths. The wood–wood and wood–FRP <b>bonded</b> <b>interfaces</b> tested in this study exhibit a stable crack propagation behavior. The unique TENF specimen and experimental–design program presented in this paper can be efficiently used to evaluate the Model-II fracture toughness of hybrid material <b>interface</b> <b>bonds,</b> and the fracture toughness values obtained can be applied to detect the potential delamination and crack growth of the adhesively bonded joints...|$|R
