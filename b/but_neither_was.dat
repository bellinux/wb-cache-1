5|$|Inland {{from the}} bay, {{the towns of}} Harrisburg and Houston were both founded on the Buffalo Bayou by {{entrepreneurs}} from New York and competed as commercial centers, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>was</b> as significant as Galveston. Texas State Historical Association.Davenport (1843), p. 170. Throughout the 19th century these three cities developed increasing influence on the Bay Area communities, particularly as railroads were built through the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Dubourdieu sent {{a report}} to the Minister of War describing the French losses. Henri IV took several hits, with 1 dead and 9 wounded. The Sané suffered more damage than the Gomer, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>was</b> seriously damaged. Three men were killed on the Sané, and nine were wounded.|$|E

5|$|Following this failure, Krugers {{made the}} {{documentary}} Atma De Vischer (1931), which followed Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Hendrik {{on a trip}} through the Hague, before being signed to Tan's Film. With Tan's, Krugers made two films. First {{he was asked to}} handle cinematography on Bachtiar Effendi's 1932 talkie Njai Dasima, an adaptation of G. Francis' 1896 novel Tjerita Njai Dasima (Story of Njai Dasima). He then directed and produced Huwen op Bevel (Forced to Marry; 1931), which was advertised as featuring songs and comedy. The film was a commercial failure, leading to all rights being acquired by Tan's. He is recorded as planning a further two films, De Nona (Of Ladies) and Raonah, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>was</b> made.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination, but President Arthur was contemplating a run for election in his own right. George Edmunds was again the favored candidate among reformers and John Sherman had a few delegates pledged to him, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>was</b> expected to command much support at the convention. John A. Logan of Illinois hoped to attract Stalwart votes if Arthur’s campaign was unsuccessful. Blaine was unsure he wanted to try for the nomination for the third time and even encouraged General William T. Sherman, John Sherman’s older brother, to accept it if it came to him, but ultimately Blaine agreed to be a candidate again.|$|E
5|$|Stuttgart and Stettin {{remained}} in German waters during the war, and both saw {{action at the}} Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916. The two cruisers engaged in close-range night fighting with the British fleet, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>was</b> significantly damaged. Both ships were withdrawn from service later in the war, Stettin {{to serve as a}} training ship, and Stuttgart to be converted into a seaplane tender in 1918. They both survived the war, and were surrendered to Britain as war prizes; they were dismantled in the early 1920s.|$|E

5|$|After {{a period}} of {{extensive}} training, the airborne force took off in two aircraft–glider combinations {{on the night of}} 19 November 1942. Both managed to reach the Norwegian coast, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>was</b> able to reach their objective. The first pair suffered from navigational difficulties and severe weather, which resulted in the tow rope snapping and the first glider crash–landing, with its towing aircraft returning to base; three airborne troops were killed outright, with the survivors captured shortly after the crash. The second pair fared even worse, with both aircraft and glider crashing into a mountain for unknown reasons; the aircrew and some airborne troops were killed outright, and those who survived were taken prisoner. None survived for very long, being executed as a result of Adolf Hitler's Commando Order, which stated all Commando personnel were to be immediately executed upon capture. At the end of the war, Wehrmacht personnel were tried and condemned to death for their part in the executions.|$|E
5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade bounced off the helmet of the soldier standing next to him and landed nearby. Bleak tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from the grenade, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>was</b> injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one of the men had been hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E
5|$|In September 1951, Oliphant {{applied for}} a visa {{to travel to the}} United States for a nuclear physics conference in Chicago. The visa was not refused, nor was Oliphant accused of subversive activities, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>was</b> it issued. This was the height of the Red Scare. The American McCarran Act {{restricted}} travel to the United States, and in Australia the Menzies government was attempting to ban the Communist Party, and was not inclined to support Oliphant against the American government. A subsequent request to travel to Canada via Hawaii in September 1954 was refused by the United States Department of State. Although Oliphant was granted a special waiver that allowed him to transit the US, he preferred to cancel the trip rather than accept this humiliation. The Menzies government subsequently excluded him from participating in or observing the British nuclear tests at Maralinga, nor was he allowed access to classified nuclear information for fear of antagonising the US.|$|E

5|$|Olid treated González and Las Casas more as honoured guests than as prisoners. Pedro de Briones' {{abandonment}} of Honduras {{resulted in a}} significant weakening of Olid's forces. Las Casas and González Dávila took advantage of this opportunity, and of Olid's excessive trust in his prisoners, to attack Olid and escape from their confinement. Once free, they expected support from Briones. Seizing their opportunity, González and Las Casas set upon Olid one evening and seriously wounded him. Olid managed to escape and hid in an Indian hut, but he was quickly found, and subjected to a rapid trial. Olid was executed by having his throat cut in the plaza at Naco. After the death of Olid, Spanish relations with the natives of Naco deteriorated notably. The Indians were increasingly unwilling to provide the Spanish with food and other supplies, {{and most of the}} Spanish abandoned the settlement and either returned to Mexico or resettled in other parts of Honduras. A court in Mexico subsequently condemned Las Casas and González Dávila for their execution of Olid, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>was</b> ever punished.|$|E
5|$|The {{company also}} began a close working {{relationship}} with Ida Lupino of Four Star International. She starred in two suspense films with Robert Ryan—Nicholas Ray's On Dangerous Ground (1952, though shooting had been completed two years earlier) and Beware, My Lovely (1952), a coproduction between RKO and Lupino's company, The Filmakers. Of more historic note, Lupino was Hollywood's only female director during the period; of the five pictures The Filmakers made with RKO, Lupino directed three, including her now celebrated The Hitch-Hiker (1953). Exposing many moviegoers to Asian cinema for the first time, RKO distributed Akira Kurosawa's epochal Rashomon in the United States, sixteen months after its original 1950 Japanese release. The only smash hits released by RKO in the 1950s came out during this period, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>was</b> an in-house production: Goldwyn's Hans Christian Andersen (1952) was followed by Disney's Peter Pan (1953).|$|E

25|$|The {{coat of arms}} of Tsarskoye Selo {{was adopted}} on 12 March 1831 as a crowned {{monogram}} of Catherine I. It was however not the emblem of the city, but only of the imperial residence.

25|$|Carr {{turned himself}} in the {{following}} morning and later pleaded guilty to manslaughter.

He wrote a collaboration novel with Burroughs, And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks, concerning the murder.|$|E
