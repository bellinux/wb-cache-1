Freight is mostly <b>bulk</b> <b>traffic</b> geared towards export industries, with general freight being largely restricted to containerised and palletised products on the trunk route.

2500|$|During {{its early}} years, the ACL handled mostly {{seasonal}} agricultural products, but by World War II its freight traffic {{had become more}} diverse. [...] During the 1950s, around 44% of all freight traffic consisted of manufactured and miscellaneous items, while <b>bulk</b> <b>traffic</b> like coal and phosphates also expanded during this time. During the 1950s, the ACL acquired some 13,000 new freight cars, to be used on high-speed trains offering reduced running times compared to earlier equipment. This allowed the railroad to remain competitive {{in the face of}} competition from the Interstate highway system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Grid traffic {{characteristics}} {{are quite different}} from that of normal Internet traffic, as they impose more stringent constraints (such as packet delay and flow deadlines) on network resources. This paper explores differentiated channel provisioning in grid network, in order to schedule <b>bulk</b> data <b>traffic.</b> We propose a solution based on the two-phase routing scheme to provision the virtual channels, such that it will satisfy any valid traffic matrix. Then we detail a simple, online, preemptive algorithm for scheduling <b>bulk</b> data <b>traffic.</b> I...|$|R

50|$|Network routers on {{high volume}} traffic links may {{introduce}} latency that exceeds permissible thresholds for VoIP. When the load on a link grows {{so quickly that}} its switches experience queue overflows, congestion results and data packets are lost. This signals a transport protocol like TCP to reduce its transmission rate to alleviate the congestion. But VoIP usually uses UDP not TCP because recovering from congestion through retransmission usually entails too much latency. So QoS mechanisms can avoid the undesirable loss of VoIP packets by immediately transmitting them ahead of any queued <b>bulk</b> <b>traffic</b> on the same link, even when that <b>bulk</b> <b>traffic</b> queue is overflowing.|$|E

40|$|A {{bandwidth}} {{control mechanism}} is proposed for ATM networks that can control of bandwidth usage {{in the presence}} of both connection-oriented and connectionless traffic, as well as multiple classes of connectionless traffic. The bandwidth control mechanism operates at three levels. At the topmost level, bandwidth is dynamically regulated between connection-oriented and connectionless traffic based on the utilization of each traffic type. At the next level, bandwidth is controlled between different classes of connectionless traffic, such as real-time <b>traffic,</b> <b>bulk</b> data <b>traffic,</b> and so on. At the lowest level, bandwidth is distributed among flows belonging to the same connectionless traffic class...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAutophagy is an {{intracellular}} degradation pathway highly conserved in eukaryotic species. It {{is characterized}} by selective or <b>bulk</b> <b>trafficking</b> of cytosolic structures—ranging from single proteins to cell organelles—to the vacuole or a lysosome, in which the autophagic cargo is degraded. Autophagy fulfils a large set of roles, including nutrient mobilization in starvation conditions, clearance of protein aggregates and host defence against intracellular pathogens. Not surprisingly, autophagy {{has been linked to}} several human diseases, among them neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Autophagy is coordinated by the action of the Atg 1 /ULK 1 kinase, which is the target of several important stress signaling cascades. In this review, we will discuss the available information on both upstream regulation and downstream effectors of Atg 1 /ULK 1, with special focus on reported and proposed kinase substrates...|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} {{station at}} Pyle was opened by the South Wales Railway in 1850.

This {{is evidenced by the}} fact that during World War II there were two military 'pill-boxes' overlooking its approaches. This station was closed by the Western Region of British Railways in 1964 as part of the notorious Beeching Axe, {{less than a year after}} the L&O lines also lost their passenger service (traffic ceased on 9 September 1963, with complete closure following in February 1965).|$|E
5000|$|Sited at the {{confluence}} of the rapidly flowing Lehigh River's waters with the more stately waters of the deeper wider Delaware, Easton became a major commercial center during the canal and railroad periods of the 19th century, when it would become a transportation hub for the eastern steel industry. The Delaware Canal, was quickly built soon after the lower Lehigh Canal (1818) became effective in regularly and reliably delivering much needed anthracite coal, into more settled lands along the rivers. And eventually the Morris would also serve to connect the rapidly developing Coal Regions to the north and west, to the fuel starved iron works to the west, the commercial port of Philadelphia to the south, and to the many home owners seeking fuel for heat within Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware and New York. Seeing other ways of exploiting the new fuel source, other entrepreneurs quickly moved to connect across the Delaware River reaching into the New York City area to the east via a connection with the Morris Canal in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, so the town became a canal nexus or hub from which the Coal from Mauch Chunk reached the world. The early railroads were often built to parallel and speed shipping along transportation corridors, and by the late 1860s the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (LH&S) and Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR) were built to augment the <b>bulk</b> <b>traffic</b> through the canals and provide lucrative passenger travel services. The LVRR, known as 'the Black Diamond Line' would boast the twice daily [...] "Black Diamond Express" [...] daily passenger trains to and from New York City and Buffalo, New York via Easton. The Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ), would lease and operate the LH&S tracks from the 1870s until the Conrail consolidations absorbed both the Central Railroad of New Jersey and Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1966. Today, the Lehigh Valley Railroad's main line is the only major rail line that goes through Easton and is now known as the Lehigh Line; the Lehigh Line was bought by the Norfolk Southern Railway in 1999.|$|E
