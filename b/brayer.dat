That day, finding Gérard's troops holding the Guillotière Bridge, Pahlen moved north through {{the villages of}} Mesnil-Saint-Père and Géraudot to reach Dosches. His probes in the {{direction}} of Laubressel were chased off by French forces. Peter von Wittgenstein's Russian corps occupied Piney while Wrede's Bavarian-Austrian corps spent the night near Vendœuvres. On the southern flank the corps of Crown Prince of Württemberg and Gyulai pursued MacDonald's forces. They drove Brayer's division from Bar-sur-Seine at a cost of 500 Allied and 100 French casualties. <b>Brayer</b> fell back to join XI Corps.|$|E

2500|$|The {{day after}} his defeat, Oudinot withdrew his troops to Vendœuvres, weakly pursued by the Allies. Unaware of Oudinot's setback, MacDonald {{advanced}} to Laferté-sur-Aube where the Allies had destroyed the bridge. On 28 February soldiers from Gyulai's corps attacked Michel Sylvestre <b>Brayer's</b> division at Silvarouvres, seizing the bridge there. MacDonald abandoned Laferté-sur-Aube and began pulling back to Bar-sur-Seine. Casualties were about 600 men on each side. On 1 March the Allies sent out two reconnaissance forces under Johann Maria Philipp Frimont and Peter Petrovich Pahlen. Frimont occupied Vendœuvres after some skirmishing with Gérard, while Pahlen operated on Frimont's right.|$|R

On the left wing were 10,000 troops in Henri François Marie Charpentier's 31st Division, the II Cavalry Corps and Amey's flying column. These were tasked to defend the Rhine, Meuse, Waal and Ijssel Rivers. The center counted 6,000 men from Michel Sylvestre <b>Brayer's</b> 35th Division near Wesel while the 7,500-strong right wing {{consisted}} of the V Corps and III Cavalry Corps. Bülow's corps numbered 19,172 foot soldiers and 6,240 horsemen organized in four infantry and three cavalry brigades. The infantry contingent included the 3rd Brigade under Karl Heinrich von Zielinski, 4th Brigade led by Heinrich Ludwig August von Thümen, 5th Brigade commanded by Karl Heinrich Ludwig von Borstell and 6th Brigade directed by Karl August Adolf von Krafft. Adolf Friedrich von Oppen commanded cavalry brigades led by Karl Alexander Wilhelm von Treskow, Karl Friedrich Bernhard Hellmuth von Hobe and Hans Joachim Friedrich von Sydow. Karl Friedrich von Holtzendorff directed the corps artillery, pioneers and wagon train. In round numbers, Bülow commanded 30,000 soldiers and 96 field guns.|$|R

There is pharmacological evidence for the involvement of Ca 2 + channels in this influx, but their presence has not been directly demonstrated {{because of the small}} size of this cell. Sea urchin sperm Ca 2 + channels are being studied by fusing isolated plasma membranes into planar lipid <b>brayers.</b> With this strategy, a Ca P+ channel has been detected with the following characteristics: (a) the channel exhibits a high mainstate conductance (3 'MS) of 172 pS in 50 mM CaCIp solutions with voltage-dependent decaying to smaller conductance states at negative Era; (b) the channel is blocked by millimolar concentrations of Cd 2 +, Co P+, and La 3 +, which also inhibit the egg jelly-induced acrosome reaction; (c) the "yMS conductance sequence for the tested divalent cations is the following: Ba P+> Sr P+> Ca 2 +; and (d) the channel discriminates poorly for divalent over monovalent cations (Pc~/PN~ = 5. 9). The sperm Ca P+ channel 3 'MS rectifies in symmetrical 10 mM CaC 12, having a maximal slope conductance value of 94 pS at + 100 mV applied to the c/s side of the bilayer. Under these conditions, a different single-channel activity of lesser conductance became apparent above the "}'MS current at positive membrane potentials. Also in 10 mM Ca P+ solutions, Mg ~+ permeates through the main channel when added to the c/s side with a Pc~/PMg = 2. 9, while it blocks when added to the trans side. In 50 mM Ca P+ solutions, the ") 'MS open probability has values of 1. 0 at voltages more positive than- 40 mV and decreases at more negatives potentials, following a Boltzmann function with an E 0. s =- 72 mV and an apparent gating charge value of 3. 9.

2500|$|Digby Smith {{stated that}} the French lost 500 killed and wounded plus 1,000 men and 14 guns {{captured}} {{out of a total}} of 4,000. The Prussians sustained losses of 600 killed and wounded out of 10,000 troops engaged. Charpentier's division included the 22nd Light and the 22nd, 51st, 55th, 102nd, 112th and 123rd Line Infantry Regiments. Michael V. Leggiere asserted that the Prussians inflicted losses of 700 killed and wounded while capturing 1,024 French soldiers and 15 guns. Two battalions of the 112th Line were virtually wiped out with only 78 men escaping. Leggiere also reported the total French loss as [...] "almost 1,500". The Prussians were disorganized by their triumph and suffered about 700 casualties. Thümen's brigade reported losses of 245 officers and men.

2500|$|While Napoleon {{defeated}} Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher's Army of Silesia in the Six Days Campaign, Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg's Army of Bohemia forced its {{way across}} the Seine River. With the French forces falling back to the Yerres River, Napoleon sent MacDonald's XI Corps south to Guignes which it reached late on 14 February 1814. This was followed by a French victory in the Battle of Montereau on 18 February. At this time the 8,000-man XI Corps included the divisions of Michel Sylvestre <b>Brayer,</b> Joseph Jean Baptiste Albert and Amey. On 17–18 February Amey's division only included the 2nd Brigade which was made up of two battalions each of the 149th Line and Calvados National Guard and one battalion of the Manche National Guard. On 28 February, Napoleon ordered Amey's division withdrawn to Troyes to guard the army's wagon train and artillery parks. On 1 March the division counted only 772 infantry and a 70-man horse artillery company with four 8-pounders and one howitzer.|$|E
30|$|Membrane {{technology}} is {{the most widely used}} and accepted around the world for the treatment and improvement of various water resources. Advancements in membrane materials and other aspects of membrane desalination technology have lowered overall operating costs, which have ultimately reduced the cost of implementing public water quality improvement programmes. Membrane processes are very effective in removing many harmful constituents in water and are deemed the most appropriate water treatment technology for many years. There are different types of membrane desalination processes used in the potable water treatment field. A particular process should be selected based on the most cost-effective way to remove constituents in the feed water to meet the water quality goals. Reverse osmosis (RO) membranes are found to be more effective in removing majority of constituents. The pore size of a RO membrane is so small that it functions primarily by diffusion instead of filtration or adsorption (Jim 1995). Most of the membranes applicable to water treatment are prepared from synthetic organic polymers and have been classified into cellulosic or non-cellulosic membrane types. The cellulosic types include cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate and blends of these. The non-cellulosic types include polyamides (both aliphatic and aromatic), polyurea, polysulfone, etc. (Lozier and Bergman 1990). Manufacturers produce different types of membranes designed for various types of feed water. RO membranes can be classified by cross-sectional form into (1) asymmetric (2) composite. Asymmetric membranes are composed of a single polymer type and contain a thin dense skin that serves as the active desalination barrier layer. Thin-film composite membranes are formed by depositing a very thin polymer film which acts as the active barrier layer onto the surface of a different polymer that serves as the porous support layer (Lozier and Bergman 1990). In spite of several advantages of recently manufactured membranes, composite membranes experienced substantial membrane fouling and/or membrane degradation, due to improperly designed or poorly operated RO system, resulting in the decrease in productivity and also rejection. Membrane fouling could be either chemical or biological. Chemical fouling of membrane is due to particulate, colloidal matter, silica, oxides of metals and mineral scales, viz. CaCO 3, CaSO 4, Mg (OH) 2, Fe (OH) 3, FeCl 3 and organic matter (David and Rehman 1990; Lepore and Ahlert 1988; Vaugham 1989; Farooque et al. 1999), whereas biological fouling is due to bacteria (Lepore and Ahlert 1988; Vaugham 1989; Farooque et al. 1999; Wolfaardt and Cloete 1992; <b>Brayers</b> and Chraklis 1981; Ridgway 1989; Saad 1992). Degradation of the membranes can be either due to physical deformation or chemical changes (hydrolysis or oxidation). Fouling and degradation of membrane not only reduce the production and quality but also result in increase in operating expenditure. Thus, it is imperative to investigate and understand the causes of any decline in RO system performance and thereby employ necessary measures to avoid either degradation or fouling of membrane. One of the causes of the decline in productivity of RO system is the chemical degradation of RO membrane itself.|$|R
