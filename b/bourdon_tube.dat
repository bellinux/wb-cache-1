The reference side is independently pressurized to a test pressure and provides a zero reference while providing a pressure calibration reference for the active side. The deflection noted by the active side at specimen failure is duplicated on the reference side by venting until an appropriate magnitude of pressure versus deflection is determined.

50|$|Pressure gauges: If the {{pressure}} of aggressive fluids or gases has to be measured, the gauge has to be isolated from the flow. For critical applications a diaphragm sealing is used instead of a <b>bourdon</b> <b>tube</b> in the gauge. This gives more security that the aggressive media will not leak. The diaphragm is a self-contained sensor, transmitting the displacement to the measuring device.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical or elastic gauges {{depend on}} a <b>Bourdon</b> <b>tube,</b> diaphragm, or capsule, usually made of metal, which will change shape in {{response}} to the pressure of the region in question. A variation on this idea is the capacitance manometer, in which the diaphragm makes up a part of a capacitor. A change in pressure leads to the flexure of the diaphragm, which results in a change in capacitance. These gauges are effective from 103 torr to 10−4 torr, and beyond.|$|E

50|$|A {{pressure}} switch for sensing fluid pressure contains a capsule, bellows, <b>Bourdon</b> <b>tube,</b> diaphragm or piston element that deforms or displaces proportionally to the applied pressure. The resulting motion is applied, {{either directly or}} through amplifying levers, {{to a set of}} switch contacts. Since pressure may be changing slowly and contacts should operate quickly, some kind of over-center mechanism such as a miniature snap-action switch is used to ensure quick operation of the contacts. One sensitive type of {{pressure switch}} uses mercury switches mounted on a Bourdon tube; the shifting weight of the mercury provides a useful over-center characteristic.|$|E
50|$|The first ornithopters {{capable of}} flight were {{constructed}} in France. Jobert in 1871 used {{a rubber band}} to power a small model bird. Alphonse Pénaud, Abel Hureau de Villeneuve, and Victor Tatin, also made rubber-powered ornithopters during the 1870s. Tatin's ornithopter was perhaps {{the first to use}} active torsion of the wings, and apparently it served as the basis for a commercial toy offered by Pichancourt circa 1889. Gustave Trouvé was the first to use internal combustion, and his 1890 model flew a distance of 80 metres in a demonstration for the French Academy of Sciences. The wings were flapped by gunpowder charges activating a <b>Bourdon</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The first {{recreational}} mechanical analogue dive computer, the [...] "decompression meter" [...] {{was designed}} by the Italians De Sanctis & Alinari in 1959 and built in their factory named SOS, which also made depth gauges. The decompression meter was distributed directly by SOS and also by scuba diving equipment firms such as Scubapro and Cressi. It was very simple in principle: a waterproof bladder filled with gas inside a big casing bled into a smaller chamber through a semi-porous ceramic cartridge (to simulate tissue in/out gassing). The chamber pressure was measured by a <b>bourdon</b> <b>tube,</b> calibrated to indicate decompression status. The device functioned so poorly that it was eventually nicknamed [...] "bendomatic".|$|E
50|$|In practice, a {{flattened}} thin-wall, closed-end tube is connected at the hollow {{end to a}} fixed pipe containing the fluid pressure to be measured. As the pressure increases, the closed end moves in an arc, and this motion is converted into the rotation of a (segment of a) gear by a connecting link that is usually adjustable. A small-diameter pinion gear is on the pointer shaft, so the motion is magnified further by the gear ratio. The positioning of the indicator card behind the pointer, the initial pointer shaft position, the linkage length and initial position, all provide means to calibrate the pointer to indicate the desired range of pressure for variations {{in the behavior of}} the <b>Bourdon</b> <b>tube</b> itself. Differential pressure can be measured by gauges containing two different Bourdon tubes, with connecting linkages.|$|E
50|$|The Bourdon {{pressure}} gauge uses {{the principle that}} a flattened tube tends to straighten or regain its circular form in cross-section when pressurized. Although this change in cross-section may be hardly noticeable, and thus involving moderate stresses within the elastic range of easily workable materials, the strain of the material of the tube is magnified by forming the tube into a C shape or even a helix, such that the entire tube tends to straighten out or uncoil, elastically, as it is pressurized. Eugene Bourdon patented his gauge in France in 1849, and it was widely adopted because of its superior sensitivity, linearity, and accuracy; Edward Ashcroft purchased Bourdon's American patent rights in 1852 and became a major manufacturer of gauges. Also in 1849, Bernard Schaeffer in Magdeburg, Germany patented a successful diaphragm (see below) {{pressure gauge}}, which, together with the Bourdon gauge, revolutionized pressure measurement in industry. But in 1875 after Bourdon's patents expired, his company Schaeffer and Budenberg also manufactured <b>Bourdon</b> <b>tube</b> gauges.|$|E
50|$|Micro {{switches}} {{are very}} widely used; among their applications are appliances, machinery, industrial controls, vehicles, convertible tops {{and many other}} places for control of electrical circuits. They are usually rated to carry current in control circuits only, although some switches can be directly used to control small motors, solenoids, lamps, or other devices. Special low-force versions can sense coins in vending machines, or with a vane attached, air flow. Micro switches may be directly operated by a mechanism, or may be packaged {{as part of a}} pressure, flow, or temperature switch, operated by a sensing mechanism such as a <b>Bourdon</b> <b>tube.</b> In these latter applications, the repeatability of the actuator position when switching happens is essential for long-term accuracy. A motor driven cam (usually relatively slow-speed) and one or more micro switches form a timer mechanism. The snap-switch mechanism can be enclosed in a metal housing including actuating levers, plungers or rollers, forming a limit switch useful for control of machine tools or electrically-driven machinery.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the direct}} reading {{hydrostatic}} manometer design on the right, applied pressure Pa pushes the liquid {{down the right}} side of the manometer U-tube, while a length scale next to the tube measures the difference of levels. The resulting height difference [...] "H" [...] is a direct measurement of the pressure or vacuum with respect to atmospheric pressure. In the absence of differential pressure both levels would be equal, and this would be used as the zero point. [...] The Industrial Revolution saw the adoption of [...] "indirect" [...] pressure measuring devices, which were more practical than the manometer.An example is in high pressure (up to 50 psi) steam engines, where mercury was used to reduce the scale length to about 60 inches, but such a manometer was expensive and prone to damage.

50|$|NACA Report 107 {{describes}} a pressure-measuring device that was adapted {{for use in}} mapping indicator diagrams of high-speed internal combustion engines. The cards are obtained by a point-to-point method giving the average {{of a large number}} of engine cycles. The principle involved is the balancing of the engine cylinder pressure against a measured pressure on opposite sides of a metal diaphragm of negligible stiffness. In its application as an engine indicator the phase of the engine cycle to which a pressure measurement corresponds is selected by a filming device. Thereport discusses errors to be avoided in the development of an indicator for light high-speed engines, where vibration is serious, and outlines the principles underlying the design of this instrument in order to be free of such errors. A description of the instrument and accessories follows, together with operating directions. Specimen indicator diagrams are appended. The indicator has been used successfully at speeds up to 2,600 rpm, the highest speed available for trial. Its sensitivity is approximately that of a standard 6-inch dial gauge of the <b>Bourdon</b> <b>tube</b> type.|$|E
