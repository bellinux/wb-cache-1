40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) {{is a new}} {{solid state}} process for joining metals by {{plasticizing}} and consolidating materials around the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> using thermal energy producing from frictional forces. A feasibility study for FSW of Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) was investigated using aluminum 6092 alloy reinforced with 17 % SiC particulates. FSW process consists of a special rotating pin tool that is positioned to plunge into the MMC surface at the <b>bond</b> <b>line.</b> As the tool rotates and move forward along the <b>bond</b> <b>line,</b> the material at the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> is heated up and forced to flow around the rotating tip to consolidate on the tip's backside to form a solid state joint. FSW {{has the potential for}} producing sound welds with MMC because the processing temperature occurs well below the melting point of the metal matrix; thereby eliminating the reinforcement-to-matrix solidification defects, reducing the undesirable chemical reactions and porosity problems...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we test the {{hypothesis}} that adhesive through-reinforcement in combination with glass-fibre reinforcement of adhesive <b>bond</b> <b>lines</b> will significantly improve the fracture toughness of a laminated birch wood composite. We test this hypothesis using a model composite consisting of perforated veneer that allowed a polyurethane adhesive to penetrate and reinforce veneers within the composite. Model composite specimens were tested for mode I fracture properties, and scanning electron microscopy {{was used to examine}} the microstructure of fracture surfaces. Our results clearly show that through-reinforcement, and also reinforcing adhesive <b>bond</b> <b>lines</b> with glass-fibre, significantly improved fracture toughness of the birch wood composite. Our results also indicate that improvements in fracture toughness depended on the level of reinforcement. Improvements in fracture toughness were related to the ability of the reinforcement to arrest crack development during fracture testing and the fibre bridging effect of glass-fibre in adhesive <b>bond</b> <b>lines.</b> We conclude that through-reinforcement is an effective way of improving the fracture toughness of laminated wood composites, but {{further research is needed to}} develop practical ways of creating such reinforcement in composites that more closely resemble commercial products...|$|E
40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of timber as structural material in large structures is often {{governed by the}} cost of structural joints. Tests indicate that the new joint concept presented herein using glued wood-to-steel plate joints can possibly reduce the cost by matching joint strength to member strength. The design is inspired by two previously proposed designs using a single large dowel and using a rubber foil interlayer in adhesive joints. Analytical 1 D and numerical 3 D models of the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> are proposed {{in order to further}} develop the concept, both {{in the case of a}} traditional adhesive joint and for the innovative rubber foil adhesive joint. The glued wood-to-steel plate joints studied are lap joints with a load bearing capacity assumed to be governed by failure within or along the <b>bond</b> <b>line.</b> In the 1 D and 3 D structural models both linear elastic and non-linear fracture mechanics were applied, with the non-linear fracture mechanics model taking into account the gradual damage fracture softening in a fracture zone. For the conventional type of <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> it was found that <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> softening needs to be considered for adequate strength analysis while it was not needed for a <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> with a rubber foil. The computational results are compared to previous full scale test results. The numerical results show good agreement and the analytical results reasonable agreement. When using a high strength adhesive, the strength of the wood along the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> is governing joint failure. For this case, the analyses predict a 150 % load bearing capacity increase by the introduction of a rubber foil as compared to a traditional design. The test results indicated an even higher increase...|$|R
40|$|WOSInternational audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{contributions of}} numerical modelling {{for the analysis}} of adhesively bonded assemblies for marine applications. Such applications are often characterised by relatively thick, 0. 5 mm or more, adhesive joints and by a possible variability of the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> thickness associated with large-scale structures manufactured in boatyard environment. Experimental and numerical analysis in the case of shear tests are proposed to study the influence of <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> thickness on the mechanical behaviour of the adhesive. In order to accurately analyse the complete non-linear behaviour of an adhesive in an assembly, specimens with low edge effects have to be used. An increase in the thickness of the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> leads to an increase in the influence of the edge effects, computed under elastic assumption. As those numerical results are not able to completely analyse all the experimental observations, various 2 D simulations, with refined meshes, taking into account the non-linear behaviour of the adhesive are proposed to complete the analysis. Even for bonded assemblies with low edge effects, computed under elastic assumptions, the analysis of the stress distribution throughout the thickness of the joint, taking into account the non-linear behaviour of the adhesive underlines that an increase in the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> thickness leads to an increase in equivalent plastic deformation close to the free edges. This property can explain that an increase in the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> thickness can lead to a reduction in the transmitted load associated to crack initiation...|$|R

40|$|The load {{capacity}} of long adhesive lap joints is often governed by stress concentrations at the lap ends. This paper investigates {{a method to}} minimize these stress concentrations by using a bond line with low shear stiffness and sufficient strength, here denoted as a resilient bond line. The resilient bond line is intended to increase the load carrying capacity of long lap joints by achieving a more uniform shear stress distribution while maintaining an elastic joint behaviour without damage or plastic deformation. The study comprises analytical, numerical and full-sized experimental work on double lap joints with lengths 200 – 700 mm comparing conventional stiff <b>bond</b> <b>lines</b> to resilient <b>bond</b> <b>lines.</b> Different resilient bonds lines were obtained by using rubber-like adhesives and by having a rubber mat within the bond line. An analytical definition of a ‘long’ lap joint is suggested and a study of adhesive-rubber bonding is also presented. The numerical analysis clearly indicates that an increase in load carrying capacity is made possible using resilient <b>bond</b> <b>lines.</b> A good agreement is also found between the numerical results and the analytical Volkersen theory, indicating that reasonable strength predictions {{can be obtained by}} hand calculations if the joint is designed in order to minimize the influence of peel stress. The experimental results of the resilient bond line verify the numerical findings, although production difficulties decrease the statistical significance of the result. On the contrary, the experimental results of the conventional <b>bond</b> <b>lines</b> significantly exceeded the numerical predictions, showing similar load carrying capacities to the resilient bond line. This is probably due to the specific boundary conditions used in the test setup. Despite some contradictory experimental results, the conclusion {{of this study is that}} the efficiency of long lap joints can be increased by the use of a bond line with low shear stiffness and sufficient strength...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the behaviour of <b>bond</b> <b>lines</b> of Densified Veneer Wood (DVW) reinforced timber connections. Studies by Leijten in the 90 s have shown that reinforcing timber connections with DVW results in a significant enhancement of connection properties. The DVW is in these connections glued onto the timber. Recently, these reinforced connections were studied in column-beam and splice type arrangements using a connecting flitch plate. In these arrangements additional stresses are introduced in the bond line. A numerical study was performed to the bond line capacity, but experiments did not fully verify the predictions. For the present study the fracture mechanical properties of <b>bond</b> <b>lines</b> between DVW and Norway Spruce were determined experimentally, and were implemented in three dimensional finite element models. Delamination tests were performed to verify the numerical procedure. From these tests it is concluded that the numerical predictions correspond well to the experiments...|$|E

A two-level, six-parameter, fractional factorial matrix was constructed and conducted for two cleaners, Brulin 815 GD and Diversey Jettacin. The matrix parameters included cleaner temperature and concentration, wash density, wash pressure, rinse pressure, and dishwasher type. Other spray parameters: nozzle stand-off, rinse water temperature, wash and rinse time, dry conditions, and type of rinse water (deionized) were held constant.

By manufacturing laminated beams from unseasoned side boards several advantages are obtained. Beams were manufactured from side boards of approximately 25 mm thickness. The board width was 120 mm. The boards were glued together with a 1 -component polyurethane adhesive to form a beam cross-section of approximately 120 × 315 mm 2. After curing, the beams were split into two halves, each approximately 55 mm wide. These 55 × 315 mm 2 beams were then dried in a conventional kiln dryer. Finally, the beams were planed to target size, 50 × 300 mm 2.
