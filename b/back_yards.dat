5|$|Pin Oak Court, in Vermont South, is {{the real}} {{cul-de-sac}} that doubles for Ramsay Street. All of the houses featured in the show are real and the residents allow Neighbours to shoot external scenes in their front and <b>back</b> <b>yards</b> and on occasions, in their garages. Neighbours has been filmed in Pin Oak Court since the series began in 1985 and it has since become popular with tourists. Tours to the cul-de-sac run throughout the year. The interior scenes are filmed at the Global Television studios in Forest Hill, the adjoining suburb in which Pin Oak Court is located.|$|E
5|$|The JNA, {{supported}} by the paramilitaries and the TO, entered Lovas unopposed {{on the morning of}} 10 October. According to court testimony of one of the paramilitaries {{who took part in the}} events, the troops moving against Lovas were told to expect 300–400 ZNG troops defending the village. Once the attacking force entered the village, the troops continued to throw grenades and shoot at houses at random for several hours. During the assault, 22 civilians were killed in their homes or <b>back</b> <b>yards.</b> In the immediate aftermath of the takeover of Lovas, Croat civilians were required to wear white armbands and their houses were marked using white sheets. The marked houses were looted and torched by the TO and paramilitaries. Authority in the village was turned over to Ljuban Devetak, a member of the Dušan Silni paramilitaries. He was styled as the commander of the village, but the JNA remained in overall control of the entire region. Over the following week, 23 more civilians were killed by the paramilitaries and the TO troops in improvised detention facilities. The improvised prisons were also used for torture and abuse of captives, including war rape, causing serious injuries to 18 civilians.|$|E

25|$|Between 1960 and 1968 street {{scenes were}} filmed before a set {{constructed}} in a studio, {{with the house}} fronts reduced in scale to 3/4 and constructed from wood. In 1968 Granada built an outside set not {{all that different from}} the interior version previously used, with the wooden façades from the studio simply being erected on the new site. These were replaced with brick façades, and <b>back</b> <b>yards</b> were added in the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features of the shophouse is the use of a variety of open-to-sky spaces to admit natural daylight as well as natural air. These open-to-sky spaces may be <b>back</b> <b>yards,</b> small airwells and most commonly, internal courtyards. Depending on their size, these courtyards may be landscaped spaces for quiet reflection, places to dry laundry, vents for cooking fumes or toilet odours or spaces for any number of household activities.|$|E
25|$|By 1859, Johnson had {{returned}} to the East and established a studio in New York City. He secured his reputation as an American artist that year with an exhibit at the National Academy of Design featuring his painting, Negro Life at the South (1859) or, as it was popularly called, Old Kentucky Home. It was set in the urban <b>back</b> <b>yards</b> of Washington, DC rather than on a plantation. That year Johnson was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1860.|$|E
25|$|There were timber framed houses {{from the}} end of the Middle Ages, and brick and wooden weather boarded houses from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. By the middle of the 19th century Carshalton's {{population}} was 2,411, making it, at the time, the largest village in what was to become the London Borough of Sutton. It had a very varied character with houses for the wealthy at one extreme and tenements in <b>back</b> <b>yards</b> at the other. In 1847 a railway line was laid from Croydon to Epsom through Carshalton, but the first station was built in fields south of Wallington. A station in the village itself was not established until 1868 when the Sutton to Mitcham Line was constructed. The development of Carshalton got into its stride in the early 1890s when the Carshalton Park Estate was sold for housing development.|$|E

25|$|From 1795 until 1818, Malacca was {{temporary}} {{placed under}} British Resident as the Netherlands were conquered by France in the Napoleonic Wars before being {{returned to the}} Dutch in 1818. As a result, to the British victory in 1811 over French and Dutch forces, a treaty was later signed in 1824 between the British and Dutch to prevent further British influence on Java, resulting in the Johor-Riau Empire separated under two colonial powers along with Malacca, which was then officially handed to the British in 1825 and integrated {{as part of the}} Straits Settlements. The city came under direct control of a Resident in Penang, and the old fort in the city was then dismantled. The British established regulations for infrastructure with the construction of, for example, back alleys, chimneys, <b>back</b> <b>yards,</b> fire escapes, fire alleys, and pedestrian arcades.|$|E

They focus on the mundane world. But no subject is fuller of implications than the mundane world!" [...] Mark Holborn, in his introduction to Ancient and Modern writes about the dark undercurrent of these mundane scenes as viewed through Eggleston's lens: [...] " [...] subjects are, on the surface, the ordinary inhabitants and environs of suburban Memphis and Mississippi—friends, family, barbecues, <b>back</b> <b>yards,</b> a tricycle and the clutter of the mundane. The normality of these subjects is deceptive, for behind the images there is a sense of lurking danger."
