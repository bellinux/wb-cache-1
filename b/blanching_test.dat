40|$|Background: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is characterized by}} chronic airflow limitation caused by ongoing inflammatory and remodeling processes of the airways and lung tissue. Inflammation can be targeted by corticosteroids. However, airway inflammation is generally less responsive to steroids in COPD than in asthma. The underlying mechanisms are yet unclear. This study aimed to assess whether skin corticosteroid insensitivity is associated with COPD and COPD severity using the corticosteroid skin <b>blanching</b> <b>test.</b> Methods: COPD patients GOLD stage I–IV (n = 27, 24, 22, and 16 respectively) and healthy never-smokers and smokers (n = 28 and 56 respectively) were included. Corticosteroid sensitivity was assessed by the corticosteroid skin <b>blanching</b> <b>test.</b> Budesonide was applied in 8 logarithmically increasing concentrations (0 – 100 mg/ml) on subject’s forearm.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{observations}} on the blood of patients acutely ill with scarlet fever has shown that a toxic substance can be demonstrated in the serum by means of intracutaneous injections of the serum in persons who have not had scarlet fever and whose serums fail to blanch the rash in scarlet fever. The reaction caused by this substance consists of a bright red local erythema, varying from 20 to 70 mm. in diameter, of 1 to 4 days duration. The severer reactions are moderately indurated and tender, and are followed bypigmentation and desquamation. Control injections in persons whose serums blanch the rash in scarlet fever cause no reaction. The toxic substance is not neutralized by mixture with a human serum which gives a negative <b>blanching</b> <b>test</b> but is readily neutralized by a human serum which gives a positive <b>blanching</b> <b>test.</b> It is not neutralized by normal horse serum, but is completely neutralized by Dochez's scarlatinal antistreptococcic serum. In {{a limited number of}} observations on the urine of patients with scarlet fever a similar toxic substance has been found in two out of five cases studied. Since the toxic substance described appears to resemble the toxic substance found in the filtrates of scarlatinal hemolytic streptococcus cultures by Dick and Dick and since it is neutralized not only by a blanching human serum but also by Dochez's scarlatinal antistreptococcic horse serum, the experiments reported support the conception that scarlet fever is a local infection of the throat by a particular type of Streptococcus hæmolyticus capable of producing a toxin which is absorbed and is the cause of the general manifestations of the disease...|$|E

40|$|Dysfunction of the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (LHPA) axis is {{a common}} finding in {{advanced}} dementia. In this study, {{the function of the}} LHPA axis at different levels was investigated in patients with dementia and in healthy elderly. A subtle disturbance in the feedback regulation of the LHPA axis was found in patients with early (i. e., mild to moderate) Alzheimer’s disease (AD). After 0. 5 mg dexamethasone, serum cortisol levels were less suppressed in AD patients and plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) levels were lower as compared with healthy elderly. After stimulation with human corticotropin-releasing hormone a blunted ACTH response was found in AD patients while relative serum cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, and androstenedione responses were increased. Significant correlations were found between low plasma ACTH levels and temporal lobe atrophy and between low peak plasma ACTH levels and hippocampal atrophy measured with computer tomography. Patients with advanced AD and multi-infarct dementia had lower basal levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate in combination with no difference in cortisol levels, resulting in a high cortisol/DHAS ratio. The difference persisted after adjustments for age and sex in a multivariate analysis. In patients with early AD, basal serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione were increased, and this increase was accentuated after stimulation with ACTH. Peripheral glucocorticoid sensitivity was examined by skin vasoconstrictor <b>blanching</b> <b>tests.</b> Patients with AD and patients treated with glucocorticoids showed skin blanching at higher clobetasol concentrations than healthy elderly. These findings justify further investigations on the role of LHPA axis dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease and its possible importance for the pathophysiology of the disease. digitalisering@um...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} {{study was}} based {{in the design of}} a process line of minimally processed potatoes and carrots determining the conditions of the critical phases of the process; such as, washing, blanching, storage and distribution. For this, a study of the market was made to find the necessities of it, and the acceptance that the product will have once it is release to the public, also the determination of an average consumption level to have an idea of the required production capacity. To find the conditions of the washing stage, tests were performed that involved the microbiological and sensorial analysis of the product, after having suffered immersions in chlorinated solutions at different concentrations. In the case of <b>blanching,</b> preliminary <b>tests</b> were conducted, that implicated the selection of the combinations of the reagents according to their microbiological profile and their level of costs.

40|$|A {{study on}} the {{production}} of earthworms was conducted using a 50 : 50 by volume of animal manures in combination with Leucaena leucocephala. A combination of sawdust, rice hull and rice bran at a proportion of 55, 35 and 10 respectively was also used as a substrate. The earthworms in each box were supplemented with either 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 g kitchen scraps. On harvesting, hand picking the earthworms from the castings and arranging {{the contents of the}} box in a pyramid were <b>tested.</b> <b>Blanching,</b> direct heating, freezing and using an oven-drier were likewise tested on "killing" earthworms prior to drying. On broiler utilization, eighty four one-day old broiler chicks were fed with the six rations formulated where in 6 %, 10 % and 14 % levels of vermimeal and fish meal were used with the commercial mash as the control. Results revealed that goat manure in combination with Leucaena leucocephala with 100 to 400 g feed supplement produced the highest gain and largest population. The pyramid method for harvesting and freezing for processing earthworms were found to be the best. Commercial broiler mash was significantly better than the home-mixed rations. In the home-mixed rations, 10 to 14 % levels of vermimeal were comparable to 6 % vermimeal and 6 - 10 % fish meal...|$|R
40|$|NASA's {{extensive}} efforts towards more efficient, safer, {{and more}} affordable space transportation include {{the development of}} new thrust-cell liner materials with improved capabilities and longer lives. For rocket engines fueled with liquid hydrogen, an important metric of liner performance is resistance to blanching, a phenomenon of localized wastage by cycles of oxidation-reduction due to local imbalance in the oxygen-fuel ratio. The current liner of the Space Shuttle Main Engine combustion chamber, a Cu- 3 Ag- 0. 5 Zr alloy (NARloy-Z) is degraded in service by blanching. Heretofore, evaluating a liner material for blanching resistance involved elaborate and expensive hot-fire tests performed on rocket test stands. To simplify that evaluation, researchers at the NASA Glenn Research Center developed a screening test that uses simple, in situ oxidation-reduction cycling in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The principle behind this test is that resistance to oxidation or to the reduction of oxide, or both, implies resistance to <b>blanching.</b> Using this <b>test</b> as a preliminary tool to screen alloys for blanching resistance can improve reliability and save time and money. In this test a small polished coupon is hung in a TGA furnace at the desired (service) temperature. Oxidizing and reducing gases are introduced cyclically, in programmed amounts. Cycle durations are chosen by calibration, such that all copper oxides formed by oxidation are fully reduced in the next reduction interval. The sample weight is continuously acquired by the TGA as usual...|$|R
40|$|Microbial load can be {{controlled}} using either synthetic or natural preservatives. Particular interest {{has been focused on}} the potential application of plant essential oils as safer additives for meat. However, there is no published research on the use of essential oils during the meat drying process. This study was focused on enhancing the meat drying process. At first a value-added dried meat product by using oregano essential oil (OEO) to inhibit the growth of bacteria, and the sensorial response from assessors is presented. It was found that the application of the OEO in meat is effective in inhibiting Salmonella enteritidis and Escherichia coli. After 6 hours of drying at 55 °C, 2 ml (0. 038 ml l- 1 air) and 1. 5 ml (0. 028 ml l- 1 air) of OEO were considered the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against S. enteritidis and E. coli, respectively. Samples treated with 0. 75 ml of OEO were more attractive for consumption compared with the control;	 at a higher concentration of OEO, the sensory quality of the food was affected. Next, the effect of modified blanching treatments on the drying behaviour of beef meat was evaluated by determining moisture ratio versus time curves and the influence on sensory quality of the resulted product. The 3 treatments under investigation were (1) oil treatment (2) steam blanching and (3) hot air blanching with 3 doses of oregano essential oil (1) 1. 5 ml (2) 3 ml and (3) 6 ml. Each treatment had an effect on the drying time of the beef samples, however, the dose of oregano essential oil applied did not affect the drying process. The results showed that steam blanching was very effective reducing the drying time. Meanwhile, 1. 5 ml and 3 ml hot air blanching samples and 1. 5 ml oil treatment samples were judged as better from sensory point of view and the respondents considered that adding oregano essential oil enriched the pleasantness of the smell. In conclusion, a value-added dried meat product obtained by using oregano essential oil to enhance food safety received an acceptable sensorial response from consumers. Additionally, each modified <b>blanching</b> treatment <b>tested</b> influences the drying kinetics process, but the dose of oregano applied did not affect the drying process. In this sense, hot air blanching and oil treatment with the lowest dose had an acceptable sensorial response from consumers...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To compare {{alternative}} methods of interpreting {{the response of}} finger skin temperature (FST) to cold provocation {{for the detection of}} the abnormal cold response observed in vibration-induced white finger (VWF). Method: The FST response to cold provocation was measured in 36 male subjects: 12 office workers, 12 manual workers and 12 manual workers with symptoms of VWF. The FSTs were monitored continuously on the distal phalanges of all five fingers of a test hand for 2 min before, for 5 min during, and for 10 min following, immersion of the test hand in water at 15 °C. Of the fingers investigated, 147 were reported not to exhibit blanching and 33 were reported to exhibit blanching. Twenty-one {{alternative methods}} of interpreting the response of FSTs to cold provocation were assessed. These were grouped as: (1) areas above the response profile (i. e. the area above the curve showing the FSTs as a function of time during cooling and recovery), (2) areas below the response profile, (3) absolute temperatures during and following cold provocation, (4) percentage differences in FSTs, (5) the times taken for FSTs to rise by specified amounts and (6) rates of change of FSTs. Differences in the response to cooling between those fingers reported to blanch and the fingers not reported to <b>blanch</b> were <b>tested,</b> and receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) were used to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the various measures to symptoms of VWF. Results: The areas above the response profile, areas below the response profile, percentage FSTs, absolute FSTs and rates of change of FSTs tended to discriminate between healthy and unhealthy subjects on a group basis. However, some of these methods of interpreting the FST response to cold provocation did not show a high sensitivity or specificity to vascular dysfunction on individual fingers. The area above the response profile, the percentage of initial temperature at the fifth minute of recovery and the maximum temperature during the 10 -min recovery period, were found to show the highest sensitivity and specificity to symptoms of vascular dysfunction. Conclusions: The method chosen to interpret the FST response to cold provocation affects the ability of the test to detect an abnormal cold response. The area above the response profile, the percentage of initial temperature at the fifth minute of recovery and the maximum temperature achieved during a 10 -min recovery period appear to be the most suitable measures for monitoring vascular function in workers exposed to hand-transmitted vibration. It is suggested that the FST response to cold provocation should be interpreted with respect to the state of initial blood flow...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{request of}} fruit and vegetables is bringing the food industry, together with the academia, to improve the processes targeted to prolong the crops shelf-life. Preservation of foods usually involves technologies that prevent microbial growth and retard enzymatic quality degradation reactions. Traditionally, thermal processing (≥ 90 °C) and freezing (≤− 40 °C) have formed the core of food preservation. During freezing, the ice crystal formation causes damages of vegetables cells walls. Furthermore, frozen vegetables are previously blanched and consumed cooked, so they are subjected also to the detrimental effect of thermal treatment. Novel nonthermal technologies {{are one of the}} alternatives currently available for the preservation of vegetables because they accomplish inactivation of microorganisms and enzymes but minimize adverse thermal exposure. Among them, the use of high hydrostatic pressures for food processing is finding increased application within the food industry. Despite several studies have been conducted on the effect of processes on vegetables, a lack of literature is still present, because of the fragmented investigation of the effect of traditional methods and still poor data on the novel technologies. Based on these considerations, the present PhD thesis deals with the evaluation of the effect of different conventional and innovative preserving technologies on vegetables by means of selected physico-chemical properties. Different approaches were investigated to reach this goal. In {{the first part of this}} PhD thesis, the evaluation of the effect of different steps of a conventional industrial freezing process was investigated on asparagus, zucchini and green beans. Samples were examined in all the stages of production “from farm to fork” as raw/uncooked (control <b>test),</b> <b>blanched,</b> boiled from the raw samples and after industrial freezing. A deep investigation was carried out to evaluate qualitative (texture and colour), histological and nutritional (antioxidant activity and bioactive compounds) aspects. The obtained results will show how manufacturers and researchers have to join together in order to develop industrial freezing process conditions according to the matrix of vegetable, with the final aim being to offer the end-user consumer high quality frozen products. In the second part of the thesis, the evaluation of different cooking methods as preservation technique for vegetables was investigated. There is a general lack of study in literature on the effect of cooking on the main quality attributes (i. e. texture, colour) that have a great impact on the final consumer acceptance of vegetables. When taken into consideration, only a single type of heating treatment or one quality attribute was discussed. Thus, this topic needs to be more deeply investigated with the ultimate goal to offer a higher quality final cooked product to the consumers, achieving a greater retention of the original quality of the processed vegetable. Starting from this observation, in a first study the effect of three common cooking procedures (boiling, steaming and microwaving) on structure, texture and colour of carrots processed in an industrial plant was studied and the obtained results were compared with those obtained from raw carrots provided by the same manufacturer and cooked with the same procedures. Then, a relatively new little explored cooking approach, the combined air/steam cooking, was the object of another investigation. Several air/steam cooking time/temperature conditions were selected and applied on two commonly used vegetables, as pumpkin and Brussels sprouts, selected on the basis of their different nutritional values and physical characteristics. The results obtained in term of cooking (cooking values, weight loss), physical (texture and colour) and nutritional (antioxidant activity and phenol contents) parameters were compared with those obtained cooking the same vegetables with a common steaming procedure. In the third part of the thesis, the impact of a novel non thermal technology, such as high hydrostatic pressure process was studied at the Centre for nonthermal treatment of food”of the Washington State University of Pullman (WA) on beetroot, which presents a well-known high nutritional value. In particular, the effect of pressure treatment realized at 650 MPa and a temperature of 21 °C was studied taking into account different times of processing evaluating physico-chemical, enzymatic and nutritional aspects. The obtained results were compared to the raw product and those treated with classical thermal treatments as blanching and canning. The preliminary findings obtained in this part of the thesis work, suggested that the high hydrostatic pressure treatment could be used as valid alternative for the preservation of beetroots, being less invasive than canning and quite comparable with blanching. In the last part of this PhD work, a novel spectroscopical approach as Raman spectroscopy was used for the evaluation of carotenoid pattern changes after different cooking treatments on carrots. Changes on carotenoid profiles measured by means of Raman spectroscopy were compared with their quantitative determinations acquired by the high-performance liquid chromatography and the colour parameters finding good statistical correlations among techniques. In conclusion, this PhD thesis revealed the strengths and weaknesses of both the traditional thermal and novel nonthermal vegetable treatments. In general, while the freezing and cooking traditional methods resulted in an extended modification of the quality parameters, the high pressure treated samples revealed a better preservation degree. The extent of the modifications observed after the application of both thermal or nonthermal processes was however related to the type of vegetable and the process conditions, therefore this finding should encourage to research and plan specific processing conditions. A big effort was given to the use of novel analytical technology, such as Raman spectroscopy, for the fast and easy way to obtain real time information on the chemical transformation of the nutrients under treatment...|$|R
