Then the charge measured for beams formed Y-jaws (10 x 1 [...] . 10 x 10 cm?). Since the multileaf are below the Y-jaw scattering them smaller. So, <b>backscatter</b> <b>factor</b> is equal the differences of charges output (multileaf (X)) - output (Y-jaw). <b>Backscatter</b> <b>factor</b> to be determined is mandatory when entering the accelerator into operation, because it amends the final dose.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 'Hot particle' skin {{dosimetry}} calculations {{are commonly}} performed using homogeneous dose-point kernels (DPK) {{in conjunction with}} scaling and backscatter models to account for non-homogeneous geometries. A new scaling model for determining the actual DPK for beta-particles transmitted by a high-Z source material has been developed. The model {{is based on a}} determination of the amount of mono-energetic electron absorption that occurs in a given source thickness through the use of EGSnrc (Electron Gamma Shower) Monte Carlo simulations. Integration over a particular beta spectrum provides the beta-particle DPK following self-absorption as a function of source thickness and radial depth in water, thereby accounting for spectral hardening that may occur in higher-Z materials. Beta spectra of varying spectral shapes and endpoint energies were used to test our model for select source materials with 7. 42 < Z ≤ 94. A new volumetric backscatter model has also been developed. This model corrects for beta-particle backscattering that occurs both in the source medium and in the atmosphere surrounding the source. Hot particle <b>backscatter</b> <b>factors</b> are constructed iteratively through selective integration of point-source <b>backscatter</b> <b>factors</b> over a given source geometry. Selection criteria are based on individual source-point positions within the source and determine which, if any, <b>backscatter</b> <b>factors</b> are used. The new scaling model and backscatter model were implemented into the DPK-based code VARSKIN 4 for extensive dose testing and verification. Verification results were compared to equivalent Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate that significant improvements can be made to DPK-based models when dealing with high-Z volumetric sources in non-homogeneous geometries...|$|R

The lower limit is calculated using an analytical photon transport model which considers only the primary dose and the scatter dose from photons that have undergone a single scattering interaction in the phantom. A parametrization of the limiting values in terms of photon energy and irradiation field size is presented and comparisons are made with BSF's from the literature.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores beta dose {{profile of}} microspheres packed in arteries, various source geometries of 142 Pr {{that can be}} used for therapeutic purpose, and dose <b>backscatter</b> <b>factors</b> for selected beta sources. A novel treatment method by injecting microspheres into feeding arteries of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is under pre-clinical investigation. To optimize radiation dose to the clinically important area, i. e. arterial wall, preliminary dosimetric studies were needed. Monte Carlo calculations were performed for several geometries simulating arteries filled with microspheres packed by random packing methods. Arterial radii used in the simulation varied from 50 mm to 3 mm; microsphere radii varied from 10 mm to 0. 7 mm. Dose varied significantly as a function of microsphere size, for constant arterial sizes. For the same sizes of arteries, significant dose increase was observed because of inter-artery exposure for large arteries (> 0. 1 cm rad.) filled with large microspheres (> 0. 03 cm rad.). Dose increase between small arteries (0. 03 cm rad.) was less significant. The dose profiles of prototype 142 Pr beta brachytherapy sources were calculated using MCNP 4 C Monte Carlo code as well as dose point kernel (DPK) for selected cases. Dose profiles were similar to beta sources currently used indicating that 142 Pr can substitute for current sources for certain cases and the DPK was closely matched with MCNP result. Backscattering of electrons is a prominent secondary effect in beta dosimetry. The backscattering is closely correlated with factors such as geometry of source and scattering material, and composition of scattering material. The <b>backscattering</b> <b>factors</b> were calculated for selected beta sources that are currently used as well as potentially useful sources for therapeutic purpose. The factors were calculated as a function of distance from the interface between water and scatterers. These factors were fit by a simple function for future incorporation into a DPK code.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{amount of}} {{backscattered}} electrons {{depends on the}} thickness of the backscattering metal. The electron backscatter increases with the increase in thickness of the metal until a saturation level is reached and thereafter no change in scatter enhancement is noticed. AimElectron backscatter effects at metallic interfaces were analysed in this study. High energy electron beams ranging from 6 to 20 MeV were used. Materials/MethodsMeasurements were carried out with a PTW thin-window parallel plate ionization chamber and an RDM- 1 F electrometer. Thin sheets of aluminium, copper and lead were used as inhomogeneities. The chamber was positioned below the inhomogeneities with the gantry maintained under the couch. ResultsThe electron <b>backscatter</b> <b>factor</b> (EBSF) increases with increase in energy for aluminium, copper and lead. With low atomic number materials EBSF increases with increase in scatterer thickness and for lead it attains saturation within a few millimetres.

For a high surface albedo (greater than 0. 30) heating of the earth-atmosphere system results due to the presence of aerosols.

ESD and depth dose were measured using ThermoLuminescent Dosimeters (TLDs), and a tissue equivalent mammography phantom recommended by the American College of Radiology (ACR). Measurements and Monte Carlo simulations were also compared with the MGD calculated using the Automatic Exposure Control (AEC) system of the mammographic unit. In the simulations the Doppler energy broadening effect was also taken into account. The simulated ESD are about 5 %- 10 % higher than the measured ESD values. The deviation between the measured and simulated MGD values in the phantom is of about 15 %. The MGD evaluated using the AEC system is smaller both with respect to the Monte Carlo simulation and experimental result by a factor of about 15 % and 25 % respectively. Moreover the <b>BackScatter</b> <b>Factor</b> (BSF) estimated by Monte Carlo simulations was used for the MGD calculation according to the Wu's method.

Since most authors had reported the entrance dose as a dose-in-air including backscatter [22, 23, 25 – 31], we followed this convention.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} feasibility of a novel real-time dosimetry method for fluoroscopically guided interventions utilizing thin-film detector arrays in several potential locations with respect to the patient and x-ray equipment. We employed Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to establish the fluoroscopic beam model to determine dosimetric quantities directly from measured doses in thin-film detector arrays at three positions: A-attached to the x-ray source, B-on the couch under the patient and C-attached to the fluoroscopic imager. Next, we developed a calibration method to determine skin dose at the entry of the beam ([Formula: see text]) as well as the dose distribution along each ray of the beam in a water-equivalent patient model. We utilized the concept of water-equivalent thickness to determine the dose inside the patient based on doses measured outside of the patient by the thin-film detector array layers: (a) A, (b) B, or (c) B and C.

40|$|This {{software}} tool locates and computes {{the intensity of}} radiation skin dose resulting from fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures. It is comprised of multiple modules. Using standardized body specific geometric values, a software module defines a set {{of male and female}} patients arbitarily positioned on a fluoroscopy table. Simulated X-ray angiographic (XA) equipment includes XRII and digital detectors with or without bi-plane configurations and left and right facing tables. Skin dose estimates are localized by computing the exposure to each 0. 01 × 0. 01 m 2 on the surface of a patient irradiated by the X-ray beam. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Structured Report Dose data sent to a modular dosimetry database automatically extracts the 11 XA tags necessary for peak skin dose computation. Skin dose calculation software uses these tags (gantry angles, air kerma at the patient entrance reference point, etc.) and applies appropriate corrections of exposure and beam location based on each irradiation event (fluoroscopy and acquis-tions). A physicist screen records the initial validation of the accuracy, patient and equipment geometry, DICOM compliance, exposure output calibration, <b>backscatter</b> <b>factor,</b> and table and pad attenuation once per system. A technologist screen specifies patient positioning, patient height and weight, and physician user. Peak skin dose is computed and localized; additionally, fluoro-scopy duration and kerma area product values are electronically recorded and sent to the XA database. This approach fully addresses current limitations in meeting accreditation criteria, eliminates the need for paper logs at a XA console, and provides a method where automated ALARA montoring is possible includ-ing email and pager alerts.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} predict dose from electron backscatter created by internal lead shielding utilized during various superficial electron beam treatments (EBT), such as lip carcinoma, {{is required to}} avoid {{the possibility of an}} overdose. Methods for predicting this dose include the use of empirical equations or physically measuring the electron <b>backscatter</b> <b>factor</b> (EBF) and upstream electron backscatter intensity (EBI). The EBF and upstream EBI are defined as the ratio of dose at, or upstream, from the shielding interface with and without the shielding present respectively. The accuracy of these equations for the local treatment machines was recognised as an area that required verification; in addition the ability of XiO's electron Monte Carlo (eMC) treatment planning algorithm to handle lead interfaces was examined. A Monte Carlo simulation using the EGSnrc package of a Siemens Artiste Linac was developed for 6, 9, 12, and 15 MeV electron energies and was verified against physical measurements to within an accuracy of 2 % and 2 mm. Electron backscatter dose distributions were predicated using the MC model, Gafchromic film, and XiO eMC, which when compared showed that XiO's eMC could not accurately calculate dose at the lead interface. Several MC simulations of lead interfaces at different depths, corresponding to energies of 0. 2 - 14 MeV at the interfaces, were used to validate the accuracy of the equations, with the results concluding that the equation could not accurately predict EBF and EBI values, especially at low energies. From this data, an equation was derived to allow estimation of the EBF and upstream EBI, which agreed to within 1. 3 % for the EBF values and can predict the upstream EBI to a clinically acceptable level for all energies...|$|E

40|$|Dose {{verification}} is {{an important}} part of all radiotherapy. Dose measurements in high dose rate brachytherapy can be challenging for a number of reasons. The steep dose gradient around HDR sources necessitates a dosimeter with a very small detection volume. Also, the logistics of placing a dosimeter in a clinically meaningful position requires they have a small physical size. In this thesis we explore the use of two detectors for measurement of the <b>backscatter</b> <b>factor</b> for an application involving the treatment of colorectal cancer. These treatments involve excising the tumour then delivering a radiation dose directly to the tumour bed during surgery using an Intra-Operative Brachytherapy applicator. In these cases the radiation dose is sometimes delivered in the absence of backscatter material which can lead to a lower dose being delivered than predicted by the treatment planning computer. Two dosimeters currently in use in brachytherapy are TLDs and MOSFETs. The use of TLDs in medical dosimetry is well established, they have a small physical size and an approximately tissue equivalent atomic number. MOSFETs have a less extensive history in medical dosimetry but their use is gaining popularity. MOSFETs have a small detection volume and are capable of giving readings in real time, making them ideal candidates for measurements around HDR brachytherapy sources. A number of MOSkin detectors were provided for this project. The MOSkin is a variation on the MOSFET detector, the main difference being a lack of epoxy bubble covering the MOSFET chip. The uncertainty in a single measurement with a MOSkin detector was estimated by examining the following dosimetric characteristics – stability, accumulated dose response, linearity, angular response, energy response, dose rate response and temperature response. Similar characteristics were also examined for TLD rods in order to make a comparison. Measurements were made using a HDR Ir- 192 source, a kilovoltage treatment unit and a high energy linac. Measurements were then made, using both TLD rods and MOSkins, to calculate the reduction in dose that results from a lack of backscatter material when using an IOBT applicator. The largest variation in the response of the MOSkins was from accumulated dose, change in radial angle and radiation energy. For each of these characteristics the response was repeatable and therefore predicted by determining a correction factor from measurements. The largest variation in the response of the TLD rods was from changes in radiation energy which again was repeatable allowing the calculation of a correction factor. Using the IOBT applicator without adequate scatter material resulted in a reduction in delivered dose as measured with both the TLD rods and MOSkins and confirmed with previously published data calculated using Monte Carlo methods. MOSkin devices provide a useful measurement tool in the presence of high dose gradients, however, the dosimetric characteristics of the detector must be accounted for when estimating the uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Neonates on a Special Care Baby Unit {{often require}} {{radiography}} {{to monitor the}} progress of their treatment {{and as a result}} can have a large number of radiographs taken during their stay in hospital. The skin entrance dose was estimated from a knowledge of the technique factors, X-ray tube output and <b>backscatter</b> <b>factors.</b> Normalized organ dose data were employed to estimate the radiation dose to a number of critical organs. A number of methods of reducing the radiation dose to neonates were investigated. Initially, this involved changing the radiographic technique factors and introducing a lead rubber adjustable collimator, placed on top of the incubator, in addition to the light beam diaphragms on the X-ray tube. It was deduced from the results of calculations that these modifications to the radiographic examination technique had reduced the average entrance dose per radiograph from 92 /zGy to 58 /xGy, a reduction of 37 %. Later, a rare-earth film-screen combination was introduced to replace the existing fast calcium tungstate screens. This enabled the average entrance dose per radiograph to be reduced to 39 /zGy, a further reduction of 33 %. The mean radiation dose to a neonate is mainly determined by the number of radiographs taken and this is dependent on the clinical symptoms. Radiology {{is one of the main}} methods of assessing the progress of treatment of neonates on a Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU). Consequently, very ill neonates may have a large number of radiographic examinations durin...|$|R
40|$|In some {{linear accelerators}} (Linac), the {{collected}} charges in beam monitor chamber (BMC) is partly {{caused by the}} backscattered particles from the accelerator components downstream the BMC that influence the Linac output factors. In the intensity modulated radiation therapy technique, the desired dose distribution can be achieved through an unflattened beam. Although removing the flattening filter provides some advantages, the amount of backscatter radiation into BMC can be changed. In this study, contribution of backscattered particles into the BMC response of a Varian 2300 C/D Linac with and without a flattening filter was determined for 6, 18 MV photon beams. The experimental procedure included telescopic method and calculation procedure consisted of Monte Carlo simulation (MCNPX, version 2. 4. 0), were used to investigate the contribution of backscattered particles into the BMC performance. Our results showed a 2. 3 and 3 increase in backscatter for a 0. 5 x 0. 5 cm 2 field compared to a 40 x 40 cm 2 field for 6 MV and 18 MV, respectively. The energy deposition from backscattered radiation is mainly caused by backscattered electrons. Removing the flattening filter did not change the BMC performance for a conventional Linac with a flattening filter. However, this result was not valid for small fields (e. g. 0. 5 x 0. 5 cm 2, 18 MV).

40|$|Purpose: This work {{investigated}} several topics {{related to}} dosimetry in soft tissue from fluoroscopic X-ray beams; first, it investigated the X-ray beam spectra and air kerma rates available {{for clinical use}} on state-of-the-art fluoroscopes using spectral (copper [Cu]) filtration; second, it investigated the fluoroscopic X-ray beam characteristics of first half-value layer (HVL), second HVL, homogeneity coefficients (HCs), and <b>backscatter</b> <b>factors</b> (BSFs) across {{the full range of}} available beam qualities; and third, it investigated the energy dependence of kerma-area-product (KAP) -meters measuring the radiation output of the fluoroscope. Materials and Methods: A state-of-the-art Siemens Artis Zee fluoroscope was operated in the service mode to allow for manual control of the technique factors (kVp, mA, ms, and Cu). Free-in-air measurements were made to determine HVLs and KAP-meter accuracy. BSFs were determined across a large range of X-ray field sizes and beam spectra with polymethyl-methacrylate. Percent depth doses (PDDs) and X-ray beam profiles were acquired across a similar range of X-ray beam spectra using a PTW water tank and a Spokas ionization chamber for the PDD measurements and a solid state dosimeter for the beam profile measurements. Results: Fluoroscopic dose rate and technique parameter curves are reported for several state-of-the-art fluoroscopes, illustrating differences in approach among vendors and establishing the basis for investigation of the X-ray beam characteristics (HVLs, HCs, BSFs, and PDDs). These X-ray beam characteristics are reported across a large range of clinically available X-ray beam spectra, providing the necessary foundation for dosimetry in soft tissue from these beams. Additionally, the accuracy of the displayed Ka,r and correction coefficients determined using the American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 190 methodology is reported across a similar range of X-ray beam spectra. Conclusion: The content of this research provides the necessary foundation for determining radiation dose at depth in soft tissue from state-of-the-art fluoroscopes. The results from this research can be used to assess dose at depth in soft tissue from fluoroscopically guided interventions, to determine fetal dosimetry from fluoroscopically guided interventions, and to validate dose modeling software...|$|R
40|$|Purpose/Objective: Backscattered {{radiation}} (BSR) into linac monitor chamber has to {{be accounted}} for in radiotherapy dose calculations. In Monte Carlo (MC) calculations, the BSR can be modeled explicitly, but only when treatment head geometry is available. In this study, monitor <b>backscatter</b> <b>factors</b> (MBSFs), defined as {{the ratio of the}} charge collected in the monitor chamber for a reference field to that of a given field, have been evaluated experimentally and incorporated into MC modelling of linacs with either known or unknown treatment head geometry. Materials and methods: A telescopic technique similar to that by Kubo (1989) was used. However, instead of lead slits, a 1. 8 mm diameter collimator and a small (2 mm diameter) detector positioned at extended SDD were used. This setup provided a field of view to the source of less than 3. 1 mm and allowed for MBSF measurements of open fields from 1 x 1 to 40 x 40 cm 2. MBSFs were also explicitly modeled in MC calculations using BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc codes for 6 MV and 18 MV beams of a Varian 21 EX linac. A method for deriving the Dchforward values that are used in MC absolute dose calculations was demonstrated. These values were derived from measured MBSFs for two 21 EX and four TrueBeam energies. Results: MBSFs were measured for 6 MV and 18 MV beams from Varian 21 EX, and for 6 MV, 10 MV-FFF, 10 MV, and 15 MV beams from Varian TrueBeam linacs. For the open field sizes modeled in this study for the 21 EX, the measured MBSFs agreed with MC calculated values within combined statistical (0. 4 %) and experimental (0. 2 %) uncertainties. Variation of MBSFs across field sizes was about a factor of two smaller for the TrueBeam compared to 21 EX Varian linacs. Conclusions: Measured MBSFs and the derived Dchforward factors allow for the incorporation of the BSR effect into accurate radiotherapy dose calculations without explicit backscatter modelling.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the existence of}} an interference contribution to the average magnetoconductance, G(B), of ballistic cavities and use it to test the semiclassical theory of quantum billiards. G(B) is qualitatively different for chaotic and regular cavities, an effect explained semiclassically by the differing classical distribution of areas. The magnitude of G(B) is poorly explained by the semiclassical theory of coherent <b>backscattering</b> (elastic enhancement <b>factor)</b> [...] correlations beyond time-reversed pairs of trajectories must be included [...] but is in agreement with random matrix theory.

40|$|The {{theory and}} design of superbackscattering {{nanoparticle}} dimers are presented. We analytically derive the optimal configurations and the upper bound of their backscattering cross-sections. In particular, it is demonstrated that electrically small nanoparticle dimers can enhance the <b>backscattering</b> by a <b>factor</b> of 6. 25 with respect to single dipolar particles. We demonstrate that optimal designs approaching this theoretical limit can be found by using a simple circuit model. The study of practical implementations based on plasmonic and high-permittivity particles reveal that fourfold enhancement factors might be attainable even with realistic losses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{measurement}} of particle size using multiple, megahertz range acoustic frequencies {{has been focused}} on particles with radii of 50 μm- 150 μm. The present study seeks to extend the applicability of the technique to particles with radii ranging from 50 μm- 425 μm. A single acoustic transducer, transmitting a waveform with three peak frequencies, was used to measure backscatter from natural sand particles entrained in a turbulent jet. An approach similar to that taken by Sheng (1991) was used in the data processing, where particle size estimates were created by comparing theoretical ratios of the <b>backscatter</b> form <b>factor</b> and size density to measured ratios. It was found that the method produces 0. 1 %- 36 % error for particles with radii of 150 μm- 425 μm and 24 %- 160 % error for particles with radii of 75 μm- 150 μm, depending on the concentration of the suspended particles.

40|$|Acoustic {{backscatter}} {{signals from}} suspended sediment, obtained at Queensland Beach N. S. in 1987, and Stanhope Lane Beach P. E. I. in 1989, are mirrored below the main bottom echo. The {{aim of this}} study is to test the hypothesis that the mirrored backscatter signals are the result of the bottom reflected wave scattering from sediment suspended above the seabed, and subsequently re-flecting from the bottom back to the transceiver. This hypothesis is tested by devising an inversion algorithm based on the re-reflection idea, to determine suspended sediment concentration and comparing to results from multifrequency and optical backscatter results. A theoretical analysis of the problem and the outcome of subsequent data inversion are presented. Unlike currently used methods, factors such as beam directivity, system constant, and the sediment <b>backscattering</b> form <b>factor</b> are absent from the equation used to determine suspended sediment concentrations. It is concluded that the bottom reflection plays a key role in the formation of the acoustic mirror image...|$|R
40|$|We study {{coherent}} backscattering of a monochromatic laser by a dilute gas of cold two-level {{atoms in}} the weakly nonlinear regime. The nonlinear response of the atoms results in a modification of both the average field propagation (nonlinear refractive index) and the scattering events. Using a perturbative approach, the nonlinear effects arise from inelastic two-photon scattering processes. We present a detailed diagrammatic derivation of the elastic and inelastic components of the backscattering signal both for scalar and vectorial photons. Especially, we show that the coherent backscattering phenomenon originates in some cases from the interference between three different scattering amplitudes. This is in marked contrast with the linear regime where it {{is due to the}} interference between two different scattering amplitudes. In particular we show that, if elastically scattered photons are filtered out from the photo-detection signal, the nonlinear <b>backscattering</b> enhancement <b>factor</b> exceeds the linear barrier two, consistently with a three-amplitude interference effect.

40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted from an L-band SAR aboard Space Shuttle Challenger in October 1984 {{to study the}} microwave backscatter dependence on soil moisture, surface roughness, and vegetation cover. The results based on the analyses of an image obtained at 21 -deg incidence angle show a positive correlatlion between scattering coefficient and soil moisture content, with a sensitivity comparable to that derived from the ground radar measurements reported by Ulaby et al. (1978). The surface roughness strongly affects the microwave <b>backscatter.</b> A <b>factor</b> of two change in the standard deviation of surface roughness height gives a corresponding change of about 8 dB in the scattering coefficient. The microwave backscatter also depends on the vegetation types. Under the dry soil conditions, the scattering coefficient is observed to change from about - 24 dB for an alfalfa or lettuce field to about - 17 dB for a mature corn field. These results suggest that observations with a SAR system of multiple frequencies and polarizations are required to unravel the effects of soil moisture, surface roughness, and vegetation cover...|$|R
