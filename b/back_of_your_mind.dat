500|$|Suanshu Khurana and A. Kameshwari of The Indian Express {{praised the}} music and {{respectively}} said, [...] "A fresh and enthusiastic set, with life's tales told in a breezy fashion. The album lacks variance, yet, it manages to have many sparkling moments." [...] and, [...] "Sensible and relatable songs making the album simplistic that automatically gets registered at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> a poetic version of our exact feelings." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis {{was happy}} to have an episode of his own, but was puzzled {{at some of the}} contradictions in the script, such as having him assassinate John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but being {{concerned}} with something as minor as keeping the Buffalo Bills from winning the Super Bowl. Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. And we see that so clearly here and it makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E

60|$|So {{many people}} do this--and you never suspect it. You see a tattered lad selling matches in the street, and {{you think there is}} nothing between him and the bleakness of immensity, between him and utter abasement, but a few tattered rags and a feeble musculature. And all unseen by you a host of heaven-sent fatuities swathes him about, even, maybe, as they swathe you about. Many men have never seen their own {{profiles}} or the <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> their heads, and for the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own <b>mind</b> no mirror has been invented. They swathe him about so thickly that the pricks of fate scarce penetrate to him, or become but a pleasant titillation. And so, indeed, it is with all of us who go on living. Self-deception is the anaesthetic of life, while God is carving out our beings.|$|R
6000|$|I {{might go}} on {{multiplying}} these examples, but I {{see that the}} clock won't wait for me, and I must therefore pass to the third question to which I referred: Granted that Biology is something worth studying, {{what is the best}} way of studying it? Here I must point out that, since Biology is a physical science, the method of studying it must needs be analogous to that which is followed in the other physical sciences. It has now long been recognised that, if a man wishes to be a chemist, it is not only necessary that he should read chemical books and attend chemical lectures, but that he should actually perform the fundamental experiments in the laboratory for himself, and thus learn exactly what the words which he finds in his books and hears from his teachers, mean. If he does not do so, he may read till the crack of doom, but he will never know much about chemistry. That is what every chemist will tell you, and the physicist will do the same for his branch of science. The great changes and improvements in physical and chemical scientific education, which have taken place of late, have all resulted from the combination of practical teaching with the reading of books and with the hearing of lectures. The same thing is true in Biology. Nobody will ever know anything about Biology except in a dilettante [...] "paper-philosopher" [...] way, who contents himself with reading books on botany, zoology, and the like; and the reason of this is simple and easy to understand. It is that all language is merely symbolical of the things of which it treats; the more complicated the things, the more bare is the symbol, and the more its verbal definition requires to be supplemented by the information derived directly from the handling, and the seeing, and the touching of the thing symbolised:--that is really what is at the bottom of the whole matter. It is plain common sense, as all truth, in the long run, is only common sense clarified. If you want a man to be a tea merchant, you don't tell him to read books about China or about tea, but you put him into a tea-merchant's office where he has the handling, the smelling, and the tasting of tea. Without the sort of knowledge which can be gained only in this practical way, his exploits as a tea merchant will soon come to a bankrupt termination. The [...] "paper-philosophers" [...] are under the delusion that physical science can be mastered as literary accomplishments are acquired, but unfortunately it is not so. You may read any quantity of books, and you may be almost as ignorant as you were at starting, if you don't have, at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>minds,</b> the change for words in definite images which can only be acquired through the operation <b>of</b> <b>your</b> observing faculties on the phenomena of nature.|$|R

[...] Jed Whedon added, [...] "There are always ideas in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> for how you'd wrap it up when they say, 'That's it guys,' but we're not there just yet." [...] By May 2017, Bell noted they had [...] "a sense of how we'd like the show to end when it ends. We just need to know when that time is coming so we can build to it properly." [...] Jed Whedon continued, [...] "Our goal is to know ahead of time, because we would love to land the story in a way that's satisfying".|$|E
