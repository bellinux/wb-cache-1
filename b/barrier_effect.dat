25|$|The {{region of}} the Parque Natual Peneda Geres falls within a {{transitional}} zone between the Atlantic and Mediterranean environments, and is influenced by various climatic systems: Atlantic, Mediterranean and Continental. Its climate is greatly influenced by the topography; the mountains exert a <b>barrier</b> <b>effect</b> {{to the passage of}} hot and wet air masses coming from the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in elevated precipitation throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|EVOH {{is used in}} {{multilayer}} {{films for}} packaging as a barrier layer (barrier plastic). As EVOH is hygroscopic (water-attracting), it absorbs water from the environment, whereby it loses its <b>barrier</b> <b>effect.</b> Therefore, it must {{be used as a}} core layer surrounded by other plastics (like LDPE, PP, PA or PET). EVOH is also used as a coating agent against corrosion at street lights, traffic light poles and noise protection walls.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{factor is the}} relief. The Bulgarian mountains and valleys act as barriers or channels for air masses, causing sharp contrasts in weather over relatively short distances. The Balkan Mountains form a barrier which effectively stops the cool air masses coming {{from the north and}} the warm masses from the south. The <b>barrier</b> <b>effect</b> of the Balkan Mountains is felt throughout the country: on the average, northern Bulgaria is about one degree cooler and receives about 192mm more rain than lowlands of southern Bulgaria. The Rilo-Rhodope Massif bars the warm Mediterranean air masses and limits the Mediterranean influence to the southern valleys of the rivers Struma, Mesta, Maritsa and Tundzha, despite the close proximity of the Aegean Sea.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} direct and <b>barrier</b> <b>eﬀects</b> of culture on economic development. It shows both theoretically and empirically that whenever the technological frontier {{is at the top}} or bottom of the world distribution of a cultural value, there exists an observational equivalence between absolute cultural distances and cultural distances relative to the frontier, preventing the identiﬁcation of its direct and <b>barrier</b> <b>eﬀects.</b> Since the technological frontier usually has the “right” cultural values for development, it tends to be in the extremes of the distribution of cultural traits, generating observational equivalence and confounding the analysis. These results highlight the diﬃculty of disentangling {{the direct and}} <b>barrier</b> <b>eﬀects</b> of culture.

40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} and destruction caused by linear infrastructure, including roads, railways, and power line corridors, {{are recognized as}} major threats to biodiversity around the world. Roads can act as barriers by impeding animal movement and restricting animal space use. An understanding of factors that influence <b>barrier</b> <b>effects</b> is important to discern the impacts of habitat {{fragmentation and}} to develop appropriate mitigation. The <b>barrier</b> <b>effects</b> of roads are driven by several distinct but not mutually exclusive mechanisms that include traffic, edge, and gap avoidance. We used an endangered forest obligate, the Mount Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis), as our study organism to assess effects of traffic noise on animal occurrence and demonstrated that traffic noise had spatially extensive and negative effects on site occupancy after accounting for effects of distance from roads and the environment. We investigated <b>barrier</b> <b>effects</b> of forest roads and assessed effects of traffic, road edges, and canopy gaps on space use of Mt. Graham red squirrels and compared to the response of introduced, edge-tolerant Abert's squirrels (Sciurus aberti). Forest roads acted as partial barriers for red squirrels regardless of traffic volume likely due to avoidance of canopy gap created by roads, whereas Abert's squirrels showed no avoidance of roads. Therefore, roads restricted movement and space use of a native forest-dependent species while creating habitat preferred by an introduced, edge-tolerated species. Through a meta-analysis of studies that quantified road crossing behavior by mammals, we found that all types of roads, from major highways to narrow forest roads, can impede movement for certain species of mammals. Magnitude of <b>barrier</b> <b>effects</b> of roads decreased as species body mass increased, and was affected positively by increasing road width. We suggest that the species-specific magnitude of <b>barrier</b> <b>effects</b> of roads may be anticipated with basic information from life history traits and road characteristics that are readily accessed through open resources or easily measured...|$|R
25|$|The Abruzzo {{region has}} {{two types of}} climate that are {{strongly}} influenced by the Apennine Mountains, dividing the climate of the coastal and sub-Apennine hills from the interior's high mountain ranges.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} eects of culture on technological diffusion and economic development. It shows that culture's direct effects on development and <b>barrier</b> <b>effects</b> to technological diusion are, in general, observationally equivalent.

Additionally, it establishes that differences in cultural traits that are correlated with genetic and linguistic distances are statistically and economically significantly correlated with differences in economic development.

40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the effects}} of a 25 –year–old motorway on the distribution of five vertebrates inhabiting a fragmented forest landscape and differing in their ability to move across linear infrastructures. We found clear evidence of <b>barrier</b> <b>effects</b> on the distribution of the forest lizard Psammodromus algirus. The roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) was also unequally distributed {{on both sides of the}} motorway, but this could also be due, at least in part, to fragmentation. The eyed lizard (Timon lepidus), that can move through open fields, showed no evidence of <b>barrier</b> <b>effects.</b> The distribution of two small birds (Erithacus rubecula and Phylloscopus bonelli) was unaffected by the motorway. Our results show that a motorway may severely restrict the distribution of species which can withstand high levels of forest fragmentation but show limited dispersal ability, highlighting the role of linear infrastructures in shaping species’ ranges at regional scales...|$|R
40|$|Background Physical {{activity}} in leisure time can increase life expectancy and cause enthusiasm, communication with others, participation in community activities and prevent withdrawal and malaise. This research studies the barriers of Kerman province’s wheel chaired people {{in participating in}} recreational activities. Methods: This study was cross-sectional. The statistical population contained all wheel chaired people of Kerman province and the sample was 276 that were chosen by convenient sampling method. The instrument was an author made questionnaire of “Participant barriers of Kerman province’s wheel chaired people” and the face and content validity (CVI= 0. 91) was confirmed by sport management professors. For validity exploratory factor analysis was used. Cronbach alpha and test retest {{was used to determine}} the reliability. Results: All leisure activities were lower than average. The mean of personal <b>barriers</b> <b>effecting</b> leisure time physical activities was lower than the average significantly. Prioritising personal <b>barriers</b> <b>effecting</b> physical activity showed {{a significant difference between the}} rankings of personal barriers and employment conditions was significantly more than other factors. The mean of structural <b>barriers</b> <b>effecting</b> physical {{activity in}} leisure time was lower than average. Ranking structural barriers showed that physical access was more than others. The mean of socio-cultural factors was significantly more than average and the view of friends, colleagues and acquaintances was significantly more than other factors. Conclusion: Wheelchaired people think most of the barriers are in relation with the attitudes of the society, coworkers and family. There are not considerable personal and structural barriers for participation in physical activity.

40|$|Roads, while {{central to}} the {{function}} of human society, create barriers to animal movement through collisions and habitat fragmentation. Barriers to animal movement affect the evolution and trajectory of populations. Investigators have attempted to use traffic volume, the number of vehicles passing a point on a road segment, to predict effects to wildlife populations approximately linearly and along taxonomic lines; however, taxonomic groupings cannot provide sound predictions because closely related species often respond differently. We assess the role of wildlife behavioral responses to traffic volume {{as a tool to}} predict <b>barrier</b> <b>effects</b> from vehicle-caused mortality and avoidance, to provide an early warning system that recognizes traffic volume as a trigger for mitigation, and to better interpret roadkill data. We propose four categories of behavioral response based on the perceived danger to traffic: Nonresponders, Pausers, Speeders, and Avoiders. Nonresponders attempt to cross highways regardless of traffic volume. Pausers stop in the face of danger so have a low probability of successful crossing when traffic volume increases. Hence, highway <b>barrier</b> <b>effects</b> are primarily due to mortality for Nonresponders and Pausers at high traffic volumes. Speeders run away from danger but are unable to do so successfully as traffic volume increases. At moderate to high volume, Speeders are repelled by traffic danger. Avoiders face lower mortality than other categories because they begin to avoid traffic at relatively low traffic volumes. Hence, avoidance causes <b>barrier</b> <b>effects</b> more than mortality for Speeders and Avoiders even at relatively moderate traffic volumes. By considering a species’ risk-avoidance response to traffic, managers can make more appropriate and timely decisions to mitigate effects before populations decline or become locally extinct...|$|R

40|$|While {{many studies}} have {{examined}} the <b>barrier</b> <b>effects</b> of large rivers on animal dispersal and gene flow, few studies have considered the <b>barrier</b> <b>effects</b> of small streams. We used displacement experiments and analyses of genetic population structure {{to examine the effects of}} first-order and second-order streams on the dispersal of terrestrial red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus (Green, 1818). We marked red-backed salamanders from near the edges of one first-order stream and one second-order stream, and experimentally displaced them either across the stream or an equal distance farther into the forest. A comparison of return rates indicated that both streams were partial barriers to salamander movement, reducing return rates by approximately 50 %. Analysis of six microsatellite loci from paired plots on the same side and on opposite sides of the second-order stream suggested that the stream did contribute to genetic differentiation of salamander populations. Collectively, our results imply that low-order streams do influence patterns of movement and gene flow in red-backed salamanders. We suggest that given the high density of first-order and second-order streams in most landscapes, these features may have important effects on species that, like red-backed salamanders, have limited dispersal and large geographic ranges...|$|R
