40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare and analyze the spatial extent and geographic location of aridity and <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>zones</b> in Morocco and their limitations using different indices used in North Africa and elsewhere in the Mediterranean region. The analysis was based on the use of data from the WORLDCLIM database, spatialization through GIS techniques, and the distribution of different plant species. Hence, the <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>zones</b> were characterized by spatial approach using Emberger pluviothermic Chart. The results showed that according to the different indices of aridity, the hyper-arid areas in Morocco represent 45 to 55 % of the country.

Arid, semi-arid and sub-humid zones potentially affected by desertification represent 42 %. The comparison of different indices used showed that De Martonne aridity index seems to be satisfactory for regional studies.

We hypothesised that principal axes of trait variation for plant species native to southern European continental, sub-alpine and alpine <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>zones</b> correlate with CSR classification scores. Functional traits were quantified in situ for 506 species of 57 families. Multivariate analysis revealed three main modes in which plants invested biomass: (1) architectural extension of individual ramets (tall canopies, large leaves), (2) durable tissues (high leaf dry matter contents and carbon contents, low specific leaf areas) or (3) regenerative development (early, extensive flowering with delicate, nitrogen-rich leaves). These were highly significantly correlated with the extent of competitive ability (C), stress-tolerance (S) and ruderalism (R), respectively, determined by CSR classification.

40|$|Aim To analyse the {{potential}} impacts {{of climate change}} on giant panda habitat based on a statistically derived Global Environmental Stratification (GEnS), using a range of CIMP 5 global climate models (GCM) across four representative concentration pathways (RCP).

Methods A supervised classification algorithm (random forests) was used to produce a statistically derived environmental stratification using a set of bioclimatic variables calculated for current climatic conditions {{and a set of}} GCMs. The classification procedure produced a set of environmental stratifications (n = 127) consisting of 75 strata which were aggregated into 13 <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>zones.</b> Geospatial analysis techniques were utilised to identify the extent of environmental change over the current panda geographic range in response to climate change. Results Future climate stratifications predict significant changes to the areal extent and elevation range of GEnS strata and <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>zones.</b> By 2070, the areal extent of <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>zones</b> in the current habitat range are projected to change by 1167 km 2 on average. Equally, the mean elevation change is projected to shift on average by 363 m.

Main Conclusions The analysis indicates that projected climate change may result in significant environmental change to the giant panda’s current geographical range.

An entomological study was carried out in July 2006 in the province of Lleida with sticky traps set in their diurnal resting places at altitudes ranging from 86 to 1, 755 m above the mean sea level (339 sites were sampled). Bivariate analysis revealed that factors such as altitude, <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>zone,</b> temperature, precipitation, sampling site (site relative to settlement, site situation, site category), wall vegetation, particular environment (in this case a natural park), general environment, adjacent natural vegetation and land cover were significantly associated with sand fly densities. The multivariate model for P. perniciosus revealed that its density was affected by site and land cover. Specifically, paved driveways correlated negatively with vector density (Incidence Risk Ratio (IRR) : 0. 41) and arable land cover correlated positively (IRR: 4. 59).

40|$|Since their {{domestication}} in the Mediterranean zone of Southwest Asia in {{the eighth}} millennium BC, sheep, goats, pigs and cattle have been remarkably successful in colonizing a broad variety of environments.

Four <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>zones</b> and 9 strata were identified, overlaid with protected areas, and associated with on-going landuse change, i. e. a rapid increase in rubber plantation from 8 % to 22 % of total area between 2002 and 2010. Significant changes in the areal extent and distribution of all zones and strata are projected, with an averaged mean annual temperature increase ranging from 1. 6 °C to 2. 4 °C. By 2050, there are significant geographical shifts in all identified strata, with an average upward shift of 309 m of elevation for all strata. On average, more than 75 % of Xishuangbanna is predicted to shift to a different zone, with 96 % shifting to a different stratum. The area conducive to rubber plantations, currently limited by climatic conditions, expands to nearly 75 % of the total area. Climatic change potentially removes the bioclimatic barriers to further expansion of rubber plantations within the area and increases pressure on remaining biodiversity both within and outside of protected areas. The analysis provides the basis for understanding potential impacts of changing bioclimatic conditions on managed and unmanaged ecosystems and landuse change trends, within the context of ongoing rapid change and agricultural expansion in the area.

40|$|The {{temporal}} and spatial vegetation dynamics is highly dependent on many different environmental and biophysical factors. Among these, climate {{is one of the}} most important factors that influence the growth and condition of vegetation. Of the abiotic factors affecting the geographic distribution of vegetation type, climate is probably the most important. Ecological research has traditionally aimed to generalize vegetation types that are assumed to be homogenous. Most of climatic classifications related to bioclimate are focused on limited climatic factors such as temperatue, precipitation and combination of them. As climate is a compound phenomena using limited factors cannot show the climate of a region, and as a result most climatic factors must be considered in bioclimatic classification. Therefore, a climatic study using various climatic factors could reveal the effective factors in distribution of vegetation. In order to determine <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>zones</b> in Chahar-Mahal & Bakhtiari province using multivariate statistical method, 71 climatic variables, which were more important in plant ecological conditions, were selected and evaluated by the factor analysis. The factor analysis revealed that the first three factors which explain % 91. 8 of total variance among the selected variables were temperature, precipitation, and radiation. According to results and using hierarchical cluster analysis in Ward’s method, bioclimatic classification in Chahar-Mahal province was carried out and 5 <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>zones</b> were found. In addition, Chahar-Mahal province was classified by 4 traditional climatic classification methods (Koppen, Gaussen, Emberger and De Martonne) and those classes were compared to climatic classes obtained by multivariate statistical method.
