40|$|SUMMARY Oesophageal {{pressure}} {{measured with}} an air-filled, thin latex balloon on a 6 French gauge catheter can accurately measure intraoesophageal pressures in ventilated preterm babies. Intra-oesophageal pressures and intrapleural pressures are equivalent. Less than 10 % of the applied positive ventilator pressure is {{transmitted to the}} oesophageal balloon and the intrapleural catheter (intercostal drain). The oesophageal traces show that ventilated <b>babies</b> <b>breath</b> independently of the ventilator. The largest deflections recorded from the oesophageal trace are from spontaneous inspiratory activity. During paralysis with pancuronium spontaneous respiration is inhibited, peristaltic waves are still recorded, {{and there is little}} transmitted pressure from the ventilator to the oesophagus or intercostal drain. Oesophageal pressure has been shown to reflect intrapleural pressure in spontaneously-breathing adultS 1 2 and babies. 3 4 Because of its accessibility the oesophagus has become the conventional place in clinical studies from which to assess intrathoracic pressure changes for determining dynamic lun...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} estimation errors which {{occur in}} control charts with estimated parameters, {{the effect that}} these errors have on the charts and the current methods which aim {{to account for the}} errors. There is a particular focus on how these errors affect the average run length of the chart and how to improve the average run length using current methods. The best methods to account for estimation error in Shewhart control charts, from the methods discussed, are the bootstrap method and the reduction of exceedance probability method. Both aim to reduce the probability that the run length of a chart is less than a specified value by adjusting the chart's control limits. However the bootstrap method has the advantage that it can be adapted to other types of control charts including risk-adjusted versions. The bootstrap method is used to analyse the Helping <b>Babies</b> <b>Breath</b> (HBB) training program data {{to see if there is}} a clinically relevant change in the probability that an infant survives 24 hours at Haydom Lutheran Hospital, Tanzania. The use of risk-adjusted cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts, with adjusted limits to account for estimation error, shows a decrease in the probability of infants not surviving 24 hours, demonstrating the positive impact of the HBB training program...|$|E

40|$|Background: WHO {{estimates}} that 814 000 infants die of birth asphyxia annually, making asphyxia the fifth {{most common cause}} of under five years death worldwide. 98 % happened in low- and middle income countries. Access to basic neonatal resuscitation to 90 % off newborns is suggested to prevent 192 000 deaths per year alone. The aim of this assignment is to summarize the literature from low- and middle income countries which evaluate the effect of learning programs in neonatal resuscitation on mortality. Methods: Studies was identified by search in Ovid Medline and by reading reference list of existing reviews on the topic. Result: Eleven studies were found. Ten were before and after intervention studies and one was a RCT. All measure the effect of either Helping <b>Babies</b> <b>Breath</b> (HBB), Essential Newborn Care (ENC) or Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP). Ten of 11 showed reduction in mortality or stillbirth rate. Both HBB, ENC and NRP had effect on mortality in some studies. HHB and ENC were also associated with reduction in stillbirth rate. When dividing studies in between facility- and community based it seems like facility based intervention is more likely to result in mortality reduction. Of the community based intervention only two was showing mortality reduction, but most of them showed a reduction in stillbirth rate. Conclusion: Training program in neonatal resuscitation seems to reduce mortality rate, stillbirth rate or both. Because of poor quality on most of the studies the evidence is moderate and {{more research is needed to}} identify the most effective intervention...|$|E
40|$|This {{analysis}} {{seeks to}} identify strengths and {{gaps in the}} existing facility capacity for intrapartum and immediate postpartum fetal and neonatal care, using data collected {{as a part of}} Malawi's Helping <b>Babies</b> <b>Breath</b> program evaluation. From August to September 2012, the Maternal and Child Health Integrated Program (MCHIP) conducted a cross-sectional survey in 84 Malawian health facilities to capture current health facility service availability and readiness and health worker capacity and practice pertaining to labor, delivery, and immediate postpartum care. The survey collected data on availability of equipment, supplies, and medications, and health worker knowledge and performance scores on intrapartum care simulation and actual management of real clients at a subset of facilities. We ran linear regression models to identify predictors of high simulation performance of routine delivery care and management of asphyxiated newborns across all facilities surveyed. Key supplies for infection prevention and thermal care of the newborn were found to be missing in many of the surveyed facilities. At the health center level, 75 % had no clinician trained in basic emergency obstetric care or newborn care and 39 % had no midwife trained in the same. We observed that there were no proportional increases in available transport and staff at a facility as catchment population increased. In simulations of management of newborns with breathing problems, health workers were able to complete a median of 10 out of 16 tasks for a full-term birth case scenario and 20 out of 30 tasks for a preterm birth case scenario. Health workers who had more years of experience appeared to perform worse. Our study provides a benchmark and highlights gaps for future evaluations and studies as Malawi continues to make strides in improving facility-based care. Further progress in reducing the burden of neonatal and fetal death in Malawi will be partly predicated on guaranteeing properly equipped and staffed facilities in addition to ensuring the presence of skilled health workers...|$|E

5000|$|It {{involves}} first freezing {{the flowers}} at 100K {{for at least}} 12 hours.
