5|$|There is {{evidence}} of Exmoor's human occupation from Mesolithic times onwards. In the Neolithic period people started to manage animals and grow crops on farms cleared from the woodland, rather than act purely as hunter gatherers. It is also likely that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make tools, weapons, containers and ornaments in <b>bronze</b> <b>and</b> then iron started in the late Neolithic and into the <b>Bronze</b> <b>and</b> Iron Ages.|$|E

5|$|Between 1887 and 1889 the French {{archaeologist}} Jacques de Morgan discovered 576 rectangular stone sepulchers, {{along with}} cultural items made of clay, <b>bronze</b> <b>and</b> iron near Akhtala {{dating back to}} the 8th century BC. The settlement of modern Akhtala was known as Agarak in the 5th century. The fortress was almost certainly built on top of <b>Bronze</b> <b>and</b> Iron Age foundations. It was built in the late tenth century by the Kyurikids, this branch of the Bagratunis originated from Gurgen (the name was pronounced Kyurikeh in the local dialect of Gugark). He was the son of the patrons of Sanahin and Haghpat monasteries located not far from Akhtala, King Ashot III the Merciful and Queen Khosrovanush. Gurgen's brothers were King Smbat II the Conqueror and Gagik I Bagratuni, under whom the Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia reached the peak of its prosperity.|$|E

5|$|Hillforts {{developed}} in the Late <b>Bronze</b> <b>and</b> Early Iron ages, around {{the start of the}} 1st millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in prehistoric Britain and their purpose has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places from the tin and copper ore necessary to make <b>bronze</b> <b>and,</b> as a result, trading patterns shifted. The old elites lost their economic and social status and power passed into the hands of a new group of people.|$|E
5|$|Somerset is a {{ceremonial}} county in South West England. It is a rural county of rolling hills, {{such as the}} Mendip Hills, Quantock Hills and Exmoor National Park, and large flat expanses of land including the Somerset Levels. Modern man came {{to what is now}} known as Somerset during the Early Upper Palaeolithic era. In the Neolithic era, from about 3500 BC, there is evidence of farming when people started to manage animals and grow crops on farms cleared from the woodland, rather than act purely as hunter gatherers. It is also likely that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make tools, weapons, containers and ornaments in <b>bronze</b> <b>and</b> then iron started in the late Neolithic and into the <b>Bronze</b> <b>and</b> Iron Ages.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{researches}} on surface roughness of CuSn 10 and CuSn 5 Zn 5 Pb 5 <b>bronzes</b> <b>and</b> aluminum AlSi 11 alloy vacuum castings prepared in plaster moulds {{are presented in}} this paper. Test samples were cut from stripe castings of dimensions 100 x 15 x 1 mm. Surfaces were carefully cleaned with use of soft brush than in ultrasonic washer and dried. Experimental castings were prepared in moulds made of two types of plaster. Cast temperatures were 1120 and 1200 °C for <b>bronzes</b> <b>and</b> 700 and 800 °C for silumin. Temperatures of the mould were 500 and 600 °C for <b>bronzes</b> <b>and</b> 200 and 300 °C for aluminum alloy. The roughness measurements were carried out with use of Hommelwerke Tester T 1000. The average arithmetic deviation of roughness profile Ra, the ten-point height of irregularities Rz and maximum {{peak to valley height}} Rm, were measured. It can be stated, on the base of obtained results, that technology of casting in plaster moulds allows preparation of castings of very low roughness, average Ra= 0, 88 ÷ 1, 74 μm for <b>bronzes</b> <b>and</b> Ra= 0, 59 ÷ 0, 83 μm for aluminum alloys. Roughness of the surface depends in fact on the cast material. Type of plaster and casting parameters have negligible influence on it...|$|R

5|$|A {{piece of}} {{slightly}} later date, the Dardanelles Gun (see picture), {{was cast in}} <b>bronze</b> <b>and</b> made in two parts: the chase and the breech, which, together, weighed 18.4tonnes. The two parts were screwed together using levers to facilitate the work. Created by Munir Ali in 1464, the Dardanelles Gun was still present for duty more than 300 years later in 1807, when a Royal Navy force appeared and commenced the Dardanelles Operation. Turkish forces loaded the ancient relics with propellant and projectiles, then fired them at the British ships. The British squadron suffered 28 dead through this bombardment.|$|E
