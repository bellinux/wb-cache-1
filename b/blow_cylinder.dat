50|$|In the 18th century, {{the process}} was carried on using a kind of reverberatory furnace, but differing from the usual kind in that air was blown {{over the surface of}} the molten lead from bellows or (in the 19th century) <b>blowing</b> <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
25|$|Around {{the same}} time the first window panes are thought to have been produced. The {{earliest}} panes were rough cast into a wooden frame on top of a layer of sand or stone, but from the late 3rd century onwards window glass was made by the muff process, where a <b>blown</b> <b>cylinder</b> was cut laterally and flattened out to produce a sheet.|$|R
50|$|Backbarrow Furnace {{was built}} in 1711 by Rawlinson, Machell and others, jointly known as the Backbarrow Company. The furnace stack was taken down in 1770 and {{replaced}} with a new one. It was bought by Harrison Ainslie in 1818. The <b>blowing</b> <b>cylinders</b> were operated by steam power in later years and the furnace fuelled by coke from 1921. It worked until 1966.|$|R

5000|$|Early blast {{furnaces}} also had one tuyere, but were fed from bellows perhaps 12 feet (3.7m) long {{operated by a}} waterwheel. During the Industrial Revolution, the blast began to be provided using steam engines, initially Watt engines working <b>blowing</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Improvements in foundry practice enabled gas-tight cast iron pipes to be produced, enabling one engine to deliver blast to several sides of a furnace, through multiple tuyeres.|$|R
50|$|Early steam {{prime movers}} were beam engines, firstly of the non-{{rotative}} (i.e. solely reciprocating) {{and later the}} rotative type (i.e. driving a flywheel). Both of these were used as blowing engines, usually by coupling an air cylinder {{to the far end}} of the beam from the steam cylinder. Joshua Field describes an 1821 trip to Foster, Rastrick & Co. of Stourbridge, where he observed eight large beam engines, one of 30 hp working a <b>blowing</b> <b>cylinder</b> of 5 feet diameter and 6 feet stroke.|$|R
5000|$|A blast furnace, 50 ft {{high and}} <b>blown</b> by <b>blowing</b> <b>cylinders</b> was {{begun to be}} built that autumn, but was {{probably}} not completed until the following year. In the meantime, pig iron was needed for the forge to work, so Wood arranged for the owners {{to take over the}} nearby Plymouth Furnace. Wood returned to Lowmill in January 1766, but was back at Merthyr in April. [...] He remained there as manager until his death in 1774. His widow stayed there until her death in 1799.|$|R
25|$|One of the NCB 5700s, No. 7754, was {{the last}} in {{industrial}} service, and after working at various collieries was moved to Deep Duffryn Colliery at Mountain Ash in 1970, where an ex-GWR fitter kept it working until 1975 when a loose piston resulted in a <b>blown</b> <b>cylinder</b> cover. No. 7754 could still be seen on shed in 1980. The NCB donated No. 7754 to the National Museum Wales, who placed it on permanent loan to the Llangollen Railway. It is now owned by the Llangollen Railway Trust.|$|R
5000|$|The furnace stack, {{of local}} stone, is intact {{to its full}} height of 29 feet, but the hearth has been removed. It was powered from a leat from the River Duddon and was blown (at least latterly) by <b>blowing</b> <b>cylinders,</b> {{described}} by Morton. [...] The bridge, leading to the charging platform, has rooms under it used for workers' housing. The charcoal barn is 100 feet long, and the iron ore store also survives. The site was investigated archaeologically in the 1980s, but only interim reports from this have been published.|$|R
5000|$|Iron making - the {{substitution}} of coke for charcoal greatly lowered the fuel cost for pig iron and wrought iron production. [...] Using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces, resulting in economies of scale. The cast iron <b>blowing</b> <b>cylinder</b> was first used in 1760. It was later improved by making it double acting, which allowed higher furnace temperatures. The puddling process produced a structural grade iron {{at a lower cost}} than the finery forge. [...] The rolling mill was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron. Hot blast (1828) greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production in the following decades.|$|R

50|$|Medieval {{stained glass}} panels could be created {{either by the}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>blown</b> sheet or crown glass (window) method.|$|R
50|$|Lawrence {{applied to}} run again at Le Mans in 1964 and was accepted. This time he would field a two-car team, with the aluminum-bodied DS301 joined by a fibreglass-bodied version. Downton was to prepare two new 1325 cc engines, {{enlarged}} from 1275 cc, but were unable {{to do the work}} and transferred the work to the BMC racing department at Abingdon who eventually delivered two 1293 cc engines. Prior to the race the two cars were not running well, so time was spent re-jetting the carburetors. Immediately after this one Deep Sanderson was destroyed in an accident while still in practice. The second, being driven by Lawrence and Gordon Spice, started poorly and then retired in the third hour of the race with a <b>blown</b> <b>cylinder</b> head gasket.|$|R
25|$|Window {{glass in}} antiquity could be {{produced}} in three ways; <b>cylinder</b> <b>blown,</b> crown manufacture or cast. In Anglo-Saxon England there is evidence for all three types of methods being used. The vast majority of glass windows were produced by the <b>cylinder</b> <b>blown</b> method, although possibly {{on a smaller scale}} than the classic methods mentioned by Theophilus. Some Anglo-Saxon window glass was produced by the crown method and at Repton thick pieces of window glass with swirling layered surfaces were possibly made using the cast method.|$|R
5000|$|The Cyfarthfa {{works were}} begun in 1765 by Anthony Bacon (by then a {{merchant}} in London), who {{in that year}} with William Brownrigg, his fellow native of Whitehaven, Cumberland leased the right to mine in a tract of 4000 acre land {{on the west side}} of the river Taff at Merthyr Tydfil. [...] They employed Brownrigg's brother-in-law Charles Wood to build a forge there, to use the potting and stamping process, for which he and his brother had a patent. This was powered by water from the river, the race dividing into six to power a clay mill (for making the pots), two stampers, two hammers and a chafery. The construction of the first coke blast furnace began in August 1766. This was intended to be 50 feet high with cast iron <b>blowing</b> <b>cylinders,</b> rather than the traditional bellows. It was probably brought into blast in Autumn 1767. [...] In the meantime, Plymouth ironworks was leased to provide pig iron for the forge.|$|R
25|$|March 26, 1939: Braniff Airways Flight 1, a DC-2-112 (NC13237), {{lost control}} and crashed on takeoff at Oklahoma City after an engine <b>cylinder</b> <b>blew,</b> killing eight of 12 on board.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cylinder</b> <b>blown</b> {{sheet glass}} was {{manufactured}} in the UK in the mid 19th century. It had been manufactured in France and Germany (and imported to the UK) since the 18th century.|$|R
50|$|In March 1856, the Arabia {{was sold}} to Captain William Terrill and William Boyd, and it made {{fourteen}} trips {{up and down the}} Missouri during their ownership. In March, it collided with an obstacle (either a rock or a sand bar), nearly sinking with a damaged rudder. Repairs were made in nearby Portland. A few weeks later it <b>blew</b> a <b>cylinder</b> head and had to be repaired again.|$|R
2500|$|Afterwards, the O.R. & N {{returned}} North Pacific to Puget Sound, {{running the}} vessel on various routes {{and as a}} relief boat. [...] In 1885, North Pacific made alternate runs with the large iron sidewheeler Olympian on the route from Puget Sound to Victoria. [...] Later, apparently after suffering a broken walking-beam and <b>blown</b> out <b>cylinder</b> head, North Pacific was demoted to relief boat service on the Vancouver, British Columbia run for Olympian and Alaskan, another large sidewheeler which was near-sistership of Olympian.|$|R
5000|$|The steamer {{also helped}} do the {{service on the}} Sidney and Nanaimo ferry route {{starting}} on June 24, 1902 replacing the Iroquois. This service was called the Sidney and Nanaimo Transportation Company. The service also made stops in the Gulf Islands. She was soon replaced by the [...] Strathcona had worked for three months of that year before she <b>blew</b> a <b>cylinder</b> on August 19, 1902. The ship was unable to be repaired, so she was retired from S&NT immediately and replaced.|$|R
5|$|Excess heat can {{be removed}} by {{immersion}} of the cylinder in a cold water bath while filling. However, immersion for cooling can also {{increase the risk of}} water contaminating the valve orifice of a completely depressurized tank and being <b>blown</b> into the <b>cylinder</b> during filling.|$|R
2500|$|The {{method of}} making flat panes of clear glass from <b>blown</b> <b>cylinders</b> began in Germany and evolved through the Middle Ages, until being perfected by the Venetians {{in the sixteenth}} century. The Venetians began using lead glass for its crystal-clarity and its easier workability. Some time during the early Renaissance, European {{manufacturers}} perfected a superior method of coating glass with a tin-mercury amalgam, producing an amorphous coating with better reflectivity than crystalline metals and causing little thermal shock to the glass. The exact date and location of the discovery is unknown, but in the sixteenth century, Venice, a city famed for its glass-making expertise, became a center of mirror production using this new technique. Glass mirrors from this period were extremely expensive luxuries. For example, in the late seventeenth century, the Countess de Fiesque {{was reported to have}} traded an entire wheat farm for a mirror, considering it a bargain. These Venetian mirrors were limited in size to a maximum area of around [...] square, until modern glass panes began to be produced during the Industrial Revolution. The Saint-Gobain factory, founded by royal initiative in France, was an important manufacturer, and Bohemian and German glass, often rather cheaper, was also important.|$|R
50|$|Until the 16th century, {{window glass}} or flat glass was {{generally}} cut from large discs (or rondels) of crown glass. Larger sheets of glass {{were made by}} <b>blowing</b> large <b>cylinders</b> which were cut open and flattened, then cut into panes. Most window glass in the early 19th century was made using the cylinder method. The 'cylinders' were 6 to 8 ft long and 10 to 14 in in diameter, limiting the width that panes of glass could be cut, and resulting in windows divided by transoms into rectangular panels.|$|R
5000|$|On 27 January 1886 {{she was on}} {{a voyage}} from Southampton to St Malo when the bottom of her {{high-pressure}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>blew</b> out, scalding one of the firemen, and disabling the ship about 15 miles north of Guernsey. The tugs Rescue and Alert were sent from Guernsey to render her assistance.|$|R
50|$|In 1891 City of Rome was {{withdrawn}} from Liverpool {{and placed on}} the Glasgow - New York route, paired with vessels only half her size. Her passenger accommodation was changed to just 75 in first class, 250 in second class, and now in 1,000 steerage. In September 1898, after {{the conclusion of the}} Spanish American War, the United States government chartered City of Rome to repatriate Spanish Navy prisoners of war. The following year, she suffered damaged in a collision with an iceberg. In 1900, she served Britain as a troopship during the Second Boer War. Later that year, she was sold to a German scrap firm, but instead returned to transatlantic duty for a short time on the Glasgow - Moville - New York route. By now the liner was obviously reaching the end of her service. One voyage took an unbelievable 13 days. She left Glasgow on Thursday 27 September 1900 and did not reach New York until Monday 8 October 1900. En route she had suffered two mechanical breakdowns. The first (a <b>blown</b> <b>cylinder</b> head) occurred on Sunday 30 September, taking 14 hours to repair. The second took place three days later, and for four hours the ship was tossed about in very heavy seas. By 1902 the decision had been made to break her up for scrap.|$|R
2500|$|Wide West had a {{reputation}} as a powerful steamer. [...] It could tow two or three barges without difficulty. [...] Wide West once lost power in one engine, but ran for several days on the one remaining engine. [...] The other <b>cylinder</b> <b>blew</b> however, on August 28, 1878, when the vessel was three miles distant from Vancouver.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the centuries}} {{techniques}} {{were developed to}} shear through {{one side of a}} <b>blown</b> glass <b>cylinder</b> and produce thinner rectangular window panes from the same amount of glass material. This gave rise to tall narrow windows, usually separated by a vertical support called a mullion. Mullioned glass windows were the windows of choice among European well-to-do, whereas paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient China, Korea and Japan. In England, glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century.|$|R
50|$|Other {{historical}} {{methods for}} making window glass included broad sheet, blown plate, crown glass, polished plate and <b>cylinder</b> <b>blown</b> sheet. These methods of manufacture lasted {{at least until}} the end of the 19th century. The early 20th century marks the move away from hand-blown to machine manufactured glass such as rolled plate, flat drawn sheet, single and twin ground polished plate and float glass.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cylinder</b> <b>blown</b> sheet {{is a type}} of hand-blown window glass. It {{is created}} with a similar process to broad sheet, but larger {{cylinders}} are produced by swinging the cylinder in a trench. The glass is then allowed to cool before the cylinder is cut. The glass is then re-heated and flattened. The result is much larger panes and improved surface quality over broad sheet.|$|R
50|$|In the 1976 World 600, Guthrie {{finished}} 15th, {{becoming the}} first woman to compete in a NASCAR Winston Cup superspeedway race. Guthrie would go on to compete in four more races that season. The following season, she competed in her first Daytona 500, finishing 12th when her car's engine <b>blew</b> two <b>cylinders</b> with ten laps to go. For the race, though, she still earned the honor of Top Rookie. Overall, Guthrie went on to compete in 33 races in NASCAR over four seasons. Her highest finish, sixth place at Bristol in 1977, is the best finish by a woman in a top-tier NASCAR race, now currently tied with Danica Patrick in 2014.|$|R
50|$|Crown {{glass is}} one of many types of hand-blown glass. Other methods include: broad sheet, blown plate, {{polished}} plate and <b>cylinder</b> <b>blown</b> sheet. These methods of manufacture lasted at least {{until the end of the}} 19th century. The early 20th century marks the move away from hand-blown to machine manufactured glass such as rolled plate, machine drawn cylinder sheet, flat drawn sheet, single and twin ground polished plate and float glass.|$|R
50|$|An {{overflow}} tank that runs dry {{may result in}} the coolant vaporizing, which can cause localized or general overheating of the engine. Severe damage can result, such as <b>blown</b> headgaskets, cracked <b>cylinder</b> heads or cylinder blocks. Sometimes {{there will be no}} warning, because the temperature sensor that provides data for the temperature gauge (either mechanical or electric) is not exposed to the excessively hot coolant, providing a harmfully false reading.|$|R
5000|$|The gang ends {{up having}} the huge {{barbecue}} they were awaiting {{since the beginning}} of the movie. Everyone comes, from Tacetin to Tonguç's grandmother. Šero, however, is sad that Misket could not make it. Suddenly, a platform rises in front of the apartment revealing Misket tied to Semistan's cylinders. Çizer, of course, is revealed to have been responsible, and threatens to <b>blow</b> up the <b>cylinders,</b> which would kill everyone, including himself.|$|R
2500|$|In December 1909, {{two of the}} sternwheelers of the Oregon City Transportation Company became disabled. [...] On Monday, December 13, 1909, near Independence, Oregon, Pomona had <b>blown</b> out two <b>cylinder</b> {{heads and}} cracked its sternwheel shaft. [...] Oregona had struck a snag the {{previous}} Wednesday and was disabled. [...] Mascot was brought down to run on the upper Willamette between Portland and Corvallis until one of the disabled vessels could be repaired.|$|R
50|$|Most {{air-cooled}} motorcycles {{take advantage}} of air <b>blowing</b> past the <b>cylinder</b> and cylinder head while in motion to disperse heat. Frequent, sustained stationary periods may cause overheating. Some models (mostly scooters) are equipped with fans that force the air to go past the cylinder block, which solves the problem of city driving. The cylinders on air-cooled bikes are designed with fins (heat sinks) to aid in this process. Air-cooled bikes are cheaper, simpler and lighter than their water-cooled counterparts.|$|R
