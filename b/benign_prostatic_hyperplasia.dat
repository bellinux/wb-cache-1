40|$|The histochemical binding {{pattern of}} the peanut (Arachis hypogaea) lectin (PNA) was quantitatively {{described}} by means of computer-assisted microscope analysis in 28 <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> <b>hyperplasias</b> (BPH), 15 <b>prostatic</b> intraepithelial neoplasias (PIN), and 119 prostatic adenocarcinomas. PNA exhibits nonimmune but selective binding to glycoproteins with beta-D-galactosyl(1, 3) -N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues. We also investigated whether a relationship existed {{between the number of}} histochemical-related PNA acceptors and the histochemical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) stain intensity, and between the number of PNA receptors and DNA ploidy level. The results show that neoplastic prostate tissues and high-grade intraepithelial prostatic neoplasias (PIN 2 _ 3) exhibit a significantly higher number of PNA acceptors than <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> <b>hyperplasias</b> and low (PIN 1) grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasias. A statistically significant correlation was observed between the number of histochemically related PNA acceptors and PSA immunostain intensity. Lastly, diploid <b>prostatic</b> tumors, whether <b>benign</b> or malignant, exhibited a significantly higher number of PNA acceptors than aneuploid ones. These results suggest that PNA acceptors {{play an important role in}} the biology of prostate tumors. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of prostatic carcinoma (Pca) on routine biopsies may be challenging, and {{to date the}} commonly used marker to distinguish prostate carcinoma from <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> lesions has been High Molecular Weight-Cytokeratin (HMW-CK). However, the antigen of HMW-CK is susceptible {{to the effect of}} formalin fixation and causes frequent loss or patchy staining in the obviously benign glands. More recently, antibodies to p 63 have been reported to be more sensitive than HMW-CK for the detection of prostatic basal cells. p 63, a homologue of tumour suppressor gene p 53, is essential for prostate development and is selectively expressed in the nuclei of basal cells of normal prostate glands. The objective {{of this study is to}} compare the sensitivity and specificity of HMW-CK and p 63 in distinguishing <b>prostatic</b> carcinomas from <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> lesions, as well as determining their positive predictive values. Seventy-two cases from HUKM (comprising 29 prostatic carcinomas and 43 <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> <b>hyperplasias)</b> were stained for both HMW-CK and p 63. The sensitivity of p 63 and HMW-CK in identifying basal cells in benign glands was 88. 37 % and 90. 70 % respectively. The specificity of both reagents was 100 %, and the positive predictive value for both reagents was also 100 %. Thus, p 63 is a useful complementary basal cell specific stain to HMW-CK, and would be very helpful to practicing pathologists in dealing with difficult cases...|$|R
40|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{is associated}} with specific benign and malignant lesions of the epithelial and mucosal surfaces. Of the sexually transmitted types, HPV type 16 (HPV 16) and HPV 18 are commonly associated with severe dysplasia and carcinoma of the uterine cervix. In men, genital HPV infections which have been studied are manifest as external lesions usually involving types other than 16 and 18. The nature of HPV 16 and 18 infections in men has not been explored. Since the most common neoplasias of the male genital tract involve the prostate gland, we assayed benign hyperplastic and cancerous prostate tumors {{for the presence of}} HPV DNA, using type-specific primers in polymerase chain reaction amplifications. Normal prostatic tissue obtained at autopsy was included in the survey. Amplified sequences specific for HPV 16 were found in 14 of 15 <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> <b>hyperplasias</b> and in all of four carcinomas tested. In contrast, HPV 18 was identified in only three benign hyperplasias, which also contained HPV 16 DNA. Four of five normal prostates demonstrated no HPV infection; one contained HPV 16 sequences. The presence of these oncogenic HPV types in prostate tissues suggests a reservoir for sexual transmission; a potential role for the virus in the etiology of prostatic neoplasia remains to be demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|To {{identify}} candidate genes {{relevant for}} prostate tumour prognosis and progression, we performed an exhaustive gene search in seven previously described genomic-profiling studies of 161 prostate tumours, and four expression profiling studies of 61 tumours. From the resulting list of candidate genes, six {{were selected for}} protein-expression analysis based {{on the availability of}} antibodies applicable to paraffinised tissue: fatty acid synthase (FASN), MYC, β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (BARK 1, GRK 2) the catalytic subunits of protein phosphatases PP 1 α (PPP 1 CA) and PP 2 A (PPP 2 CB) and metastasis suppressor NM 23 -H 1. These candidates were analysed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on a tissue microarray containing 651 cores of primary prostate cancer samples and <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> <b>hyperplasias</b> (BPH) from 175 patients. In univariate analysis, expression of PP 1 α (P= 0. 001) was found to strongly correlate with Gleason score. MYC immunostaining negatively correlated with both pT-stage and Gleason score (P< 0. 001 each) in univariate as well as in multivariate analysis. Furthermore, a subgroup of patients with high Gleason scores was characterised by a complete loss of BARK 1 protein (P= 0. 023).

40|$|BACKGROUNDA {{variety of}} hormones have {{demonstrated}} effects on prostatic tissue growth dynamics. Our {{goal was to}} define the effect of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and prolactin (PRL) on prostate cellular proliferation. METHODSThirty <b>benign</b> human <b>prostatic</b> <b>hyperplasias</b> (BPH) were maintained 48 hr as in vitro cultures. Culture media were supplemented with EGF, DHT, and PRL alone and in combinations. Proliferation was assessed by labeling with tritiated thymidine. RESULTSThe proliferative response of individual BPH cultures was heterogeneous. DHT and EGF tended {{to have a greater}} proliferative effect than PRL, both in terms of the percent cultures responding and the magnitude of the response. PRL antagonized EGF-induced proliferative effects. EGF- and PRL-mediated effects correlated with each other, while DHT-mediated effects did not correlate with either those of PRL or EGF. CONCLUSIONSThe proliferative response of individual BPH to DHT, EGF, and PRL, alone or in combination, is too variable to define a predictable response to their influence. Our methodology represents a technique with the capacity to define therapeutic potential for individual cases. Prostate 30 : 47 – 52, 1997 © 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Moreover, no difference was observed between spironolactone and placebo with regard to volume of residual urine or prostate size. Gynecomastia was observed in about 5% of people.

25|$|<b>Benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> (BPH), {{also called}} {{prostate}} enlargement, is a noncancerous increase in {{size of the}} prostate.

40|$|We have {{established}} organ cultures of human prostate in vitro {{analysis of the}} hormone responsiveness of prostatic carcinoma. The influence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and prolactin (PRL) was assessed on the proliferation rate of 30 <b>benign</b> human <b>prostatic</b> <b>hyperplasias</b> (BPH) maintained for 48 hours as short-term primary cultures. The influence exerted by the EGF, the DHT and the PRL on the BPH cell proliferation was characterized by adding these compounds alone or in combination to the culture media. The proliferation rate was assessed by means of histo-autoradiographical nuclear labeling with triated thymidine. The results show that of the DHT, EGF and PRL, the first two induced a statistically {{significant increase in the}} cell proliferation rate in a proportion of BPH significantly higher than the proportion of BPHs whose cell proliferation was increased significantly by the PRL. Furthermore, the PRL was able to antagonize the EGF-induced stimulatory effect on the BPH glandular cell proliferation rate. Lastly, the EGF- and PRL-mediated effects on the BPH glandular cell proliferation correlated with each other, while the DHT-mediated did not correlate with either the PRL- or the EGF-mediated effects. This model of organ, culture provide a basis for developing a method for in vitro testing of the individual hormone and drug responsiveness of a prostatic carcinoma.

25|$|<b>Benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> (BPH) {{occurs in}} older men; the {{prostate}} often enlarges {{to the point}} where urination becomes difficult.

40|$|A {{decreased}} prostatic {{blood flow}} {{could be one}} of the risk factors for <b>benign</b> <b>prostatic</b> hyperplasia/benign prostatic enlargement. The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) shows a chronic prostatic ischemia and hyperplastic morphological abnormalities in the ventral prostate. The effect of silodosin, a selective alpha 1 A-adrenoceptor antagonist, was investigated in the SHR prostate as a <b>prostatic</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> model focusing on prostatic blood flow. Twelve-week-old male SHRs were administered perorally with silodosin (100 μg/kg/day) or vehicle once daily for 6 weeks. Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as normotensive controls and were treated with the vehicle. The effect of silodosin on blood pressure and prostatic blood flow were estimated and then the prostates were removed and weighed. The tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 /cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 1 (CXCL 1 /CINC 1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β 1), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were measured. The histological evaluation was also performed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. There was a significant increase in blood pressure, prostate weight, prostate body weight ratio (PBR), tissue levels of MDA, IL- 6, CXCL 1 /CINC 1, TNF-α, TGF-β 1, bFGF and α-SMA in the SHR compared to the WKY rat. The ventral prostate in the SHR showed the morphological abnormalities compared to the WKY rat. Prostatic blood flow was decreased in the SHR. However, treatment with silodosin significantly restored the decreased prostatic blood flow in the SHR. Moreover, silodosin normalized tissue levels of MDA, IL- 6, CXCL 1 /CINC 1, TNF-α, TGF-β 1, bFGF and α-SMA, and it ameliorated ventral <b>prostatic</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> in the SHR excluding blood pressure. Silodosin decreased PBR but not prostate weight in the SHR. Silodosin can inhibit the progression of <b>prostatic</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> through a recovery of prostatic blood flow...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Objectives: To {{compare the}} effects and histopathological changes of botulinum neurotoxin type A and {{lysozyme}} gene injections into prostate tissue within a testosterone induced benign prostate hyperplasia rat model. Materials and Methods: 40 male Wistar rats were randomized into four Groups. Group- 1 : Control, Group- 2 : Testosterone replacement, Group- 3 : Testosterone+botulinum neurotoxin type A, Group- 4 : Testosterone+plazmid DNA/liposome complex. Results: Estimated prostate {{volume of the}} testosterone injected Groups were higher than the control (p < 0. 05). Actual prostate weight of the testosterone injected Groups was higher than the control Group (p < 0. 05). Testosterone undecanoate increased the prostate weight by 39 %. Botulinum neurotoxin type A treatment led to an estimated prostate volume and actual prostate weights decreased up to 32. 5 % in rats leading to prostate apoptosis. Lysozyme gene treatment led to an estimated prostate volume and actual prostate weights decrease up to 38. 7 %. Conclusion: Lysozyme gene and botulinum neurotoxin type A treatments for prostate volume decreasing effect have been verified {{in the present study}} that could be anew modality of treatment in <b>prostatic</b> <b>benign</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> that needs to be verified in large randomized human experimental studies...|$|R

Twenty-seven additional routinely processed radical prostatectomy specimens were studied using selected probes known to work on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material. Three probes, anticytokeratin KA 4, anti-vimentin V 9, and the lectin from Ulex europaeus (UEA- 1), demonstrated phenotypic similarities between PIN and invasive carcinoma. Whereas the luminal cells of normal or hyperplastic prostatic epithelium are minimally reactive with KA 4 (4 %) or UEA- 1 (0 %) and strongly reactive with anti-vimentin (91 %), both the PIN and invasive carcinoma are reactive with KA 4 (89 % and 93 %, respectively) and UEA- 1 (96 % and 93 %, respectively) and minimally reactive with anti-vimentin (15 % and 0 %, respectively). The increased KA 4 staining was shown to be {{in part due to}} detection of cytokeratin 19, by using cytokeratin- 19 -specific antibodies, 4. 62 and LP 2 K.
