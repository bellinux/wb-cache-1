50|$|Campers {{are often}} told to wear bright colored red ribbons <b>and</b> <b>bells,</b> <b>and</b> carry <b>whistles</b> {{to ward off}} bears.

Grizzly scat is {{difficult}} to differentiate from black bear scat, as diet is {{in a constant state}} of flux depending on the availability of seasonal food items. If a bear is killed near camp, the bear's carcass must be adequately disposed of, including entrails and blood, if possible. Failure to move the carcass has often resulted in it attracting other bears and further exacerbating a bad situation. Moving camps immediately is another recommended method.|$|R
