50|$|This {{species is}} {{threatened}} by habitat degradation. It requires open habitat for germination, but this kind of habitat is threatened <b>by</b> <b>introduced</b> flora. It is also threatened <b>by</b> <b>introduced</b> grazing animals.|$|R
50|$|The {{reasons for}} its {{extinction}} were probably avian diseases caused <b>by</b> <b>introduced</b> mosquitos, habitat destruction by cattle and goats, deforestation, predation <b>by</b> <b>introduced</b> rats, and hunting (their plumage {{was used in}} robes for the Hawaiian nobility).|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} species are {{considered}} threatened by human activities and {{are in danger of}} extinction. The majority of these are forest species with limited distribution, particularly insular species. They are threatened by habitat loss caused by forest clearance or degradation and in some cases <b>by</b> <b>introduced</b> species. The Marquesan kingfisher of French Polynesia is listed as critically endangered due to a combination of habitat loss and degradation caused <b>by</b> <b>introduced</b> cattle, and possibly due to predation <b>by</b> <b>introduced</b> species.|$|R
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>introducing</b> a {{distinction}} between diachronic and synchronic analyses of language, he laid {{the foundation of the}} modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between syntagm and paradigm, and the Langue-parole distinction, distinguishing language as an abstract system (langue), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (parole).|$|E
5|$|In addition, Euler {{elaborated}} {{the theory}} of higher transcendental functions <b>by</b> <b>introducing</b> the gamma function and introduced a new method for solving quartic equations. He also {{found a way to}} calculate integrals with complex limits, foreshadowing the development of modern complex analysis. He also invented the calculus of variations including its best-known result, the Euler–Lagrange equation.|$|E
5|$|Shawn Michaels {{continued}} his feud with Sensational Sherri at WrestleMania IX. Sherri accompanied Tatanka, and Michaels countered this <b>by</b> <b>introducing</b> Luna Vachon, his new valet.

5|$|The first {{element of}} the actinides, {{actinium}} gave the group its name, much as lanthanum had done for the lanthanides. The group of elements is more diverse than the lanthanides and therefore {{it was not until}} 1928 that Charles Janet proposed the most significant change to Dmitri Mendeleev's periodic table since the recognition of the lanthanides, <b>by</b> <b>introducing</b> the actinides, a move suggested again in 1945 by Glenn T.

The Guadalupe storm petrel was driven to extinction by feral cats, and introduced predators have also been responsible for declines in other species. Habitat degradation which limits nesting opportunities caused <b>by</b> <b>introduced</b> goats and pigs is also a problem, especially if it increases competition from more aggressive burrowing petrels.|$|R
5|$|Visible {{amounts of}} berkelium(III) {{chloride}} (BkCl3) were first isolated and characterized in 1962, and weighed only 3 billionths of a gram.

This green solid has a melting point of 600°C, and is isotypic with uranium(III) chloride. Upon heating to nearly melting point, BkCl3 converts into an orthorhombic phase.|$|E
5|$|According to Hermann Weyl, Fischer was an {{important}} influence on Noether, in particular <b>by</b> <b>introducing</b> her {{to the work of}} David Hilbert. From 1913 to 1916 Noether published several papers extending and applying Hilbert's methods to mathematical objects such as fields of rational functions and the invariants of finite groups. This phase marks the beginning of her engagement with abstract algebra, the field of mathematics to which she would make groundbreaking contributions.|$|E

In 2011, after releasing The Only She Chapters, his eighth album for the label, Warp ended their relationship with Herren. The master recordings of his material stayed with the label.|$|E

5|$|American {{automakers}} {{had first}} countered imports {{such as the}} Volkswagen Beetle with compact cars including the Ford Falcon, Chevrolet Corvair and Plymouth Valiant, although these cars featured six-cylinder engines and comprised a larger vehicle class. As the popularity of smaller Japanese imports from Toyota and Datsun increased throughout the 1960s, Ford North America responded <b>by</b> <b>introducing</b> the Ford Cortina from its European arm Ford of Europe as a captive import.

5|$|Brennus was {{the first}} pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy built in the late 19th century. She was laid down in January 1889, launched in October 1891, and completed in 1896. Her design was unique and departed from earlier ironclad battleship designs <b>by</b> <b>introducing</b> a number of innovations. These included a main battery of heavy guns mounted on the centerline and the first use of Belleville boilers.

5|$|Humans {{have also}} {{adversely}} impacted {{the ecology of}} the Everglades <b>by</b> <b>introducing</b> numerous invasive species, which may prey on or compete with native species. A spectacular and particularly damaging example of this phenomenon is the recent proliferation of the Burmese python in the Everglades, as well as elsewhere in Florida. First observed in the wild in 1979 and not again until 1995, they have increased alarmingly since 2000. By 2011, decreases of 87.5%, 94.1%, 98.9% and 99.3% in sightings of bobcats, white-tailed deer, opossums and raccoons, respectively, were reported in park road surveys, while rabbits were no longer being seen at all.|$|E
5|$|In 1786, Wilberforce leased a {{house in}} Old Palace Yard, Westminster, {{in order to be}} near Parliament.

He brought forward a bill to extend the measure permitting the dissection after execution of criminals such as rapists, arsonists and thieves. The bill also advocated the reduction of sentences for women convicted of treason, a crime that at the time included a husband's murder. The House of Commons passed both bills, but they were defeated in the House of Lords.|$|E
