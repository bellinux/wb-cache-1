25|$|The {{linear form}} of African {{sculpture}} and the depictive humanism of the figurative Renaissance painters informed his work. Working during that fertile period of “isms,” Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Futurism, Modigliani {{did not choose}} to be categorized within any of these prevailing, defining confines. He was unclassifiable, stubbornly insisting on his difference. He was an artist putting down paint on canvas creating works not to shock and outrage, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> “This is what I see.” More appreciated {{over the years by}} collectors than academicians and critics, Modigliani was indifferent to staking a claim for himself in the intellectual avant-garde of the art world. One can say he recognized the merit of Jean Cocteau’s proclamation: “Ne t'attardes pas avec l'avant-garde” (“Don’t wait for the avant-garde”). Pseudo-goitre, a medical condition is also known as Modigliani syndrome. This name was derived from the curved neck of women in Modigliani's paintings which appeared like pseudogoitre.|$|E

We can take heat if there's {{something}} wrong {{and people can}} review shows badly– that's {{something you have to}} live with– <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> people stormed out of the show was an absolute fabrication. Britney is aware of all this and she's extremely upset by it. She's a human being. I'm embarrassed, with such a big international entourage here with Britney, {{to be part of the}} Australian media when I see that kind of totally inaccurate reporting. It's been all over the internet for nine months, the inference is that we tried to hide this. It's been the opposite. This show is about an incredible spectacle, which it is".|$|E
500|$|The writers wrote Rousseau out of {{the series}} upon request by Furlan, who {{did not wish to}} travel to Hawaii to film her scenes, {{although}} she later called this an untrue rumor. The producers planned for Rousseau to get her own flashback episode in season four; however, this was delayed due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. The writers stated that Rousseau would be in the fifth season, and her story would be told, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it would be told through a flashback would be [...] "disingenuous". In the fifth season of Lost, a younger version of Rousseau is shown. Critical reaction to the character has been generally positive; however, many have expressed disappointment in the execution of Rousseau's death scene.|$|E

And she lost a lot of weight so that if you looked at her, you would say she could pass from the arms up as a dancer. She's an amazing actor.

2500|$|Deflationary {{principles}} do {{not apply}} to representations that are not analogous to sentences, and also {{do not apply}} to many other things that are commonly judged to be true or otherwise. [...] Consider the analogy between the sentence [...] "Snow is white" [...] and the character named Snow White, both of which can be true in some sense. [...] To a minimalist, saying [...] "Snow is white is true" [...] is the same as saying [...] "Snow is white," [...] <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Snow White is true" [...] {{is not the same as}} saying [...] "Snow White." ...|$|E

2500|$|The things (people, events) in {{the life}} of a person can have meaning (importance) as parts of a whole, but a {{discrete}} meaning of (the) life, itself, aside from those things, cannot be discerned. A person's life has meaning (for themselves, others) as the life events resulting from their achievements, legacy, family, etc., <b>but,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that life, itself, has meaning, is a misuse of language, since any note of significance, or of consequence, is relevant only in life (to the living), so rendering the statement erroneous. Bertrand Russell wrote that although he found that his distaste for torture was not like his distaste for broccoli, he found no satisfactory, empirical method of proving this: ...|$|E
2500|$|Madonna's {{inspiration}} {{to direct the}} film came from the controversial lives of Edward and Simpson. She recalled from her experience that if she brought up King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson {{at a dinner party}} or a social gathering, [...] "it's like throwing a Molotov cocktail into the room. Everyone erupts into an argument about who they were. I mean, they were very controversial– and continue to be. So, of course, I'm very attracted to that." [...] She investigated the history behind the abdication and tried to understand what led Edward to leave his royal throne. The singer spent two years researching the life of Simpson and writing the script. She wallpapered an empty room in her house with pictures from auction catalogues and photographs of the Duke and Duchess throughout their lives. [...] "I was sitting in a room that was completely and utterly inundated with their images so I could soak up their energy. I was trying {{to understand the nature of}} their love story and trying to figure out for myself if there is such a thing as perfect love," [...] she said. However, not interested in making a biopic about Simpson, Madonna created the modern-day story about the character Wally Winthrop, so that she could have a point of view in which to tell the narrative. She explained later: [...] "We can all read the same history book and have a different point of view. So it was important for me to not present the story and say, 'This is the one and only story,' <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'This story moved me and inspired me.' That's how the two love stories were created." ...|$|E
2500|$|Further, {{this too}} should be said. Anyone who asserts that god exists either says that god {{takes care of}} the things in the cosmos or that he does not, and, if he does take care, that it is either of all things or of some. Now if he takes care of everything, there would be no {{particular}} evil thing and no evil in general in the but the Dogmatists say that everything is full of evil; therefore god shall not be said to take care of everything. On the other hand, if he takes care of only some things, why does he take care of these and not of those? For either he wishes but is not able, or he is able but does not wish, or he neither wishes nor is able. If he both wished and was able, he would have taken care of everything; but, for the reasons stated above, he does not take care of everything; therefore, it is not the case that he both wishes and is {{able to take care of}} everything. But if he wishes and is not able, he is weaker than the cause on account of which he is not able to take care of the things of which he does not take care; but it is contrary to the concept of god that he should be weaker than anything. Again, if he is able to take care of everything but does not wish to do so, he will be considered malevolent, and if he neither wishes nor is able, he is both malevolent and weak; <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that about god is impious. Therefore, god does not take care of the things in the cosmos.|$|E

2500|$|Emigrants {{primarily}} {{settled in}} London and Soho, the latter {{had grown into}} a thriving French cultural district, complete with French hotels and cuisine, although it had long been a haven for French exiles, housing many thousands of Frenchmen from the last mass migration which occurred {{in reaction to the}} Edict of Nantes. Here the French had a somewhat easier transition into English society, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> emigrating to this district was easy is to dismiss how truly austere their circumstance; [...] "money remained a chronic concern and hunger a constant companion" [...] (Whittaker). [...] Most people just picked back up the trades they had in France, and aristocrats found themselves having to seek employment {{for the first time in}} years. [...] Those who were educated often offered their services as instructors in French, dancing, and fencing. Those who had no knowledge of skills that would benefit them as laborers turned to crime. The truly elite émigrés settled in Marylebone, Richmond, and Hampstead. The politics of these areas were extremely royalist. In contrast, émigrés from the lower classes of society often settled in St. Pancras and St. George’s Fields. Both of these areas facilitated the ability of the émigrés to maintain their Catholic faith. In St. Pancras, émigrés were allowed to use the Anglican church, and for occasions of particular significance, they were allowed to worship without any interference from the Anglican clergy. In St. George’s Fields, the Chapel of Notre-Dame was opened in 1796. These poorer émigrés were an eclectic group. They included widows, men wounded in war, the elderly, the ecclesiastics, and some provincial nobility along with domestic servants. It has been noted that “there was little that these émigrés had in common besides their misfortunes and their stoic perseverance in the absence of any alternative” Malnutrition and poor living conditions led to an onslaught of maladies, and death did not quite put an end to their suffering for even posthumously their families were beset with the financial burden of administering their funeral rites.|$|E
