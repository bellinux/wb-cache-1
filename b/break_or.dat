5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the members of the Ministerium {{intended}} for this to be a permanent <b>break,</b> <b>or</b> a temporary protest. Regardless, it became permanent when the officials at the next Gathering of the General Synod refused to admit the delegates from the Ministerium. Thus, the Ministerium found themselves on their own.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand <b>break</b> <b>or</b> unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E
5|$|The trails {{through the}} park, {{including}} one for mountain biking, run almost parallel along the ridge. There is a natural pond with fishes and turtles in the north-west of the park. A 280-metre long canopy walk was completed {{in the eastern part}} of the park in October 2003, linking Kent Ridge Park to the war museum, Reflections at Bukit Chandu, enhancing the park's and museum's accessibility to the public. Along the walk, there are information boards providing educational information on the flora and fauna in the park. At the half-way point, there is a shelter for visitors to take a short <b>break</b> <b>or</b> to enjoy a scenic view of Normanton Park and the National Parks Board's plant nursery.|$|E

5|$|In December 2006, the Center for Naval Analyses {{released}} a report on U.S. small arms in combat. The CNA conducted surveys on 2,608 troops returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 12 months. Only troops who fired their weapons at enemy targets were allowed to participate. 341 troops were armed with M249 SAWs, making up 13 percent of the survey. 71 percent of M249 users (242 troops) {{reported that they were}} satisfied with the weapon. 40 percent of users preferred feeding the SAW with the soft 100-round pouch, while 21 percent chose the soft and hard 200-round pouches each. 60 percent (205 troops) were satisfied with handling qualities, such as handguards, size, and weight - of those dissatisfied, just under half thought that it was too heavy. M249 users had the lowest levels of satisfaction with weapon maintainability at 70 percent (239 troops), most due to the difficulty in removing and receiving small components and poor corrosion resistance. The SAW had the highest levels of stoppages at 30 percent (102 troops), and 41 percent of those that experienced a stoppage said it had a large impact on their ability to clear the stoppage and re-engage their target. 65 percent (222 troops) did not need their machine guns repaired while in theater. 65 percent (222 troops) were confident in the M249's reliability, defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will fire without malfunction, and 64 percent (218 troops) were confident in its durability, defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will not <b>break</b> <b>or</b> need repair. Both factors were attributed to high levels of soldiers performing their own maintenance. 60 percent of M249 users offered recommendations for improvements. 17 percent of requests were for making the weapon lighter, and another 17 percent were for more durable belt links and drums, as well as other modifications, such as a collapsible stock.|$|E

25|$|Left arm {{orthodox}} spin bowlers generally {{attempt to}} drift {{the ball in}} the air into a right-handed batsman, and then turn it away from the batsman (towards off-stump) upon landing on the pitch. The drift and turn in the air are attacking techniques. The left-arm orthodox spin like an off <b>break</b> <b>or</b> off spin is also a bowling action.|$|E

25|$|Football {{has also}} {{extended}} the term {{to include the}} phrase perfect hat-trick, achieved when a player scores one right-footed goal, one left-footed goal and one headed goal within one match.

25|$|Two {{different}} systems were employed. The earlier, fitted to the 1965 through 1968 Ford-built {{cars and the}} 1971–1972 Nissan Cedric, employed an electric motor driving, through reduction gearing, a set of three slow-turning cams. These cams would actuate switches {{to turn on the}} lights in sequence. Later Ford cars and the 1969 Imperial used a transistorised control module with no moving parts to wear, <b>break,</b> <b>or</b> go out of adjustment.|$|E

25|$|The major {{variations}} of a left-arm spinner are the topspinner (which turns less and bounces {{higher in the}} cricket pitch), the arm ball (which does not turn at all, drifts into a right-handed batsman {{in the direction of}} the bowler's arm movement; also called a 'floater') and the left-arm spinner's version of a doosra (which turns the other way). The left-arm unorthodox spin like a leg <b>break</b> <b>or</b> leg spin is also a bowling action.|$|E
25|$|Most {{spinning}} {{today is}} done using <b>Break</b> <b>or</b> Open-end spinning, {{this is a}} technique where the staples are blown by air into a rotating drum, where they attach themselves to the tail of formed yarn that is continually being drawn out of the chamber. Other methods of break spinning use needles and electrostatic forces. This method has replaced the older methods of ring and mule spinning. It also is easily adapted for artificial fibres.|$|E
25|$|Radium bromide (RaBr2) {{is also a}} colorless, {{luminous}} compound. In water, it is more soluble than radium chloride. Like radium chloride, crystallization from {{aqueous solution}} gives the dihydrate RaBr2·2H2O, isomorphous with its barium analog. The ionizing radiation emitted by radium bromide excites nitrogen molecules in the air, making it glow. The alpha particles emitted by radium quickly gain two electrons to become neutral helium, with builds up inside and weakens radium bromide crystals. This effect sometimes causes the crystals to <b>break</b> <b>or</b> even explode.|$|E

25|$|In January 1865, Robert E. Lee {{became the}} general-in-chief of all Confederate armies, but this move {{came too late}} to help the Southern cause. As the siege of Petersburg continued, Grant {{attempted}} to <b>break</b> <b>or</b> encircle the Confederate forces in multiple attacks moving from east to west; gradually, he cut all of the Confederate supply lines except the Richmond & Danville Railroad entering Richmond and the South Side Railroad supplying Petersburg. By March, the siege had taken an enormous toll on both armies, and Lee decided {{to pull out of}} Petersburg. Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon then devised a plan to have the army attack Fort Stedman on the eastern end of the Union Lines, forcing the Union forces to shorten their lines. Although initially a success, his outnumbered corps was forced back by a Union counterattack.|$|E
