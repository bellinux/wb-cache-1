500|$|Parables for Wooden Ears {{received}} a moderate response from reviewers. Juice reviewer John Encarnacao enjoyed the rock {{elements of the}} album, drawing comparisons to Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Alice In Chains. He thanked producer Tony Cohen for the [...] "big sound" [...] of the album, {{and said that the}} musicians on the album [...] "not only know about power and restraint, but also play tastefully". Encarnacao stated that Fanning [...] "lays the emotion on thick and usually more than gets away with it." [...] The review was summarised by stating that the album may have been [...] "a <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> retro-rock that the big corporations want you to buy", but that nonetheless it was a good album.|$|E
500|$|Sanz {{was born}} in Madrid, Spain, on December 18, 1968, the {{youngest}} son of María Pizarro and Jesús Sánchez. He {{grew up in the}} neighborhood of Moratalaz in eastern Madrid. Sanz recalled that [...] "Back then, kids grew up on the street...I was a <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> group troubadour; the one who played the guitar and sang. That kept me out of a lot of trouble." [...] Sanz's father, a door-to-door book salesman, played guitar professionally, which inspired seven-year-old Sanz to learn to play the instrument. He pursued the instrument with an intensity that eventually frustrated his mother, who broke his guitar one morning after his playing kept the family from sleeping.|$|E
500|$|Often informing his {{superiors}} of critical situations, Zelenka earned the nickname [...] "Mr. Bad News" [...] among fans. In {{an interview with}} David Nykl, TheScifiWorld's Gilles Nuytens referred to Zelenka as a [...] "popular" [...] and [...] "interesting" [...] character, and compared Zelenka's apparitions in Atlantis {{to those of the}} Stargate SG-1 character Walter Harriman, [...] "a <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> icing on the cake". Another interviewer mentioned that, following a [...] "warm reception", the [...] "fans have really taken [...] to heart". When GateWorld hypothesized that viewers were looking forward to an episode where the [...] "underdog" [...] Zelenka saves the day instead of McKay, Nykl replied that the set-up dynamic earns the character more sympathy from the audience. For his portrayal of Radek Zelenka, David Nykl was nominated for a 2005 Leo Award in the category [...] "Dramatic Series: Best Supporting Performance by a Male".|$|E

500|$|Rick Porter of Zap2it {{said the}} episode was [...] "pretty good" [...] and that Jenna Fischer was [...] "fantastic", {{but he felt}} the episode was less {{outright}} funny than recent episodes. But Porter also said he had mixed feelings about Pam's decision to work for Michael and about the Charles Miner character, who he said might be too humorless and uncomfortable for the show. Travis Fickett of IGN felt it was disappointing and slow-paced compared to last week's episode [...] "New Boss": [...] "Things slow down a bit as we sort of repeat the awkwardness between Michael and new regional manager Charles Miner. It feels a <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> episode is marking time – {{which is exactly what}} Michael is doing with his final two weeks on the job." [...] "Two Weeks" [...] was voted the eighteenth highest-rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally; the episode was rated 7.74 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|Fodor's called The Dime Store [...] "bright and hip", {{offering}} [...] "office {{workers and}} hotel guests a much-appreciated source of seasonally driven, well-prepared comfort fare". Cizmar wrote a positive {{review of the}} restaurant in August 2014, in which he paid tribute to Leo's and described his two $1 extras (an egg on his BLT and maple syrup for his pancakes) as [...] "the best two dollars [...] spent all week". That same month, Thrillist contributor Drew Tyson included the diner in his list of the [...] "11 Best New Restaurants in Portland", writing: Billing itself as a [...] "finer diner", this old-school space feels a <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> diner in Twin Peaks. There's a magazine and candy counter in one corner that {{no one seems to}} touch; just quick enough service that once you start questioning whether or not you'll get another cup of coffee, one arrives; plus a menu full of classics. All-in-all it's one of the only places you can go in Downtown and feel like you're transported somewhere else entirely.|$|E
500|$|Growing up, Perry and her {{siblings}} {{were not allowed}} to eat the cereal Lucky Charms as the term [...] "luck" [...] reminded their mother of Lucifer, and had to call deviled eggs [...] "angeled eggs". Perry primarily listened to gospel music, as secular music was generally discouraged in the family's home. She discovered popular music through CDs she sneaked from her friends. While not strictly identifying as religious, Perry has stated, [...] "I pray all the time– for self-control, for humility." [...] Following her sister Angela, Perry began singing by practicing with her sister's cassette tapes. She performed the tracks in front of their parents, who suggested she take vocal lessons. She began training at age 9, and was incorporated into her parents' ministry, singing in church from ages 9 to 17. At 13, Perry was given her first guitar for her birthday, and publicly performed songs she wrote. She tried to [...] "be a <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> typical Californian girl" [...] while growing up, and started rollerskating, skateboarding, and surfing as a teenager. David described her as a tomboy during her adolescence. She took dancing lessons and learned how to swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, Tom Shales for The Washington Post criticized Morrison as Will, writing: [...] "Morrison is {{definitely}} not gleeful and doesn't seem particularly well equipped to be a high-school impresario; as pipers go, he's not even marginally pied." [...] Shales was more positive regarding Lynch's performance, and concluded that: [...] "Dramatic tension isn't exactly plentiful, but pleasingly staged songs and a general aura of retro ingenuousness come through, and seem awfully if fitfully refreshing". Variety Brian Lowry also highlighted acting and characterization issues with the show, writing that: [...] "It's among the adults, alas – who are mostly over-the-top buffoons – where Glee nearly sails off the rails, from Jane Lynch's tyrannical cheer matron to the salivating football coach, a <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Rydell High gang in Grease." [...] Lowry felt that: [...] "Modest redemption comes from the stammering Emma (Heroes Jayma Mays), who has a clear crush on Will, even though he's married to his high-school sweetheart. Perhaps to foster a rooting interest (or at least sympathy) for a Will-Emma pairing, said wife (Jessalyn Gilsig) is initially presented as a ditsy shrew." [...] Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times has called Glee: [...] "the first show {{in a long time}} that's just plain full-throttle, no-guilty-pleasure-rationalizations-necessary fun." [...] She praised Lynch as Sue, writing that [...] "Lynch alone makes Glee worth watching", and claimed that overall: [...] "The music, though by no means edgy, is energetic with a wide audience appeal, like the show itself.|$|E
500|$|Referred to as a [...] "genre roulette" [...] by the San Francisco Chronicle, Post {{touches on}} various musical styles, {{including}} industrial music, big-band jazz, trip hop, chillout, and experimental music. Jim Farber, reviewing the album in 1995 for Entertainment Weekly, considered Post to be a [...] "connecting point between industrial-disco, ambient-trance, and catchy synth pop". When asked if this variety of genres was intentional, Björk replied: [...] "Yes, I'm {{very aware of}} that. I've got very many sides to me. To be honest, I think everyone has got a thousand sides to them. It's called being human. Nature gave us that kinda complexity. Most people pretend they're only one thinglike : [...] "cool" [...] or [...] "intelligent" [...] or [...] "stupid" [...] or [...] "caring". But I think everyone are all of these things, including me". She recognises Post as darker and more aggressive than Debut, and has identified independence, strength, and instinct as its lyrical themes. In a 1997 interview, the singer said: [...] "Post... a <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Tin Tin books. Sort of Tin Tin goes to Congo. Tin Tin goes to Tibet. So it's all these different flavors, me sort of trying all these different things on". The balance between synthetic and organic elements in the album—generated through the combination of electronic and [...] "real" [...] instruments—is a recurring characteristic of Björk's output. In 1999, Vibe stated: [...] "Fusing techno, industrial, ambient, punk, and the rarefied yet tuneful spheres of art rock, Björk explores a jungle of tones, supported by her eternally buoyant voice from Mars." ...|$|E
2500|$|A chance {{discussion}} with Diane Samuels {{in the back}} of a taxi one night led to collaboration between the two. Oberman had had difficulty deciding where to transpose Chekhov's narrative, with Samuels offering up the idea of Liverpool, her home town, and the two agreeing on the post-war time frame: [...] "Liverpudlians have their own black sense of humour and comic timing, born out of having their city blown to smithereens during the war". This informed the new Jewish sensibility of the play which was anchored to the tone of Chekhov's original, where the melodrama of the Pozorov family masked the pain and social upheaval all about them. Oberman felt this echoed the way the Jewish community in Britain acted in the wake of the Holocaust: [...] "people that close to the Second World War just didn’t talk about it – a <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> elephant in the room". The intent of the play was [...] "to take a family who have the Holocaust hanging over them, and still have them laugh and moan and bicker while wondering what's for breakfast".|$|E

2500|$|Hotel Cabana is a pop, R, {{soul and}} hip hop music record, {{containing}} [...] "orchestral flourishes" [...] and [...] "Bollywood inflections". Naughty Boy called Hotel Cabana {{more than an}} album, it was an audio-visual concept. [...] "I {{want it to be}} an album for our time; it has a concept to it, so it's more like a film in some respects." [...] Speaking about putting together the album, he said [...] "I view it like I'm not just a producer – I'm a director too." [...] During an interview with the Watford Observer, Naughty Boy said [...] "It’s a very diverse, musically organic album. There’s a lot of dance-future music that’s going on now." [...] Explaining the [...] "hotel" [...] concept, he said [...] "the album is like a hotel, and just like guests coming to stay, musicians appear on the album. Each song does stand alone, but all together, the album tells a story, it’s one guy’s journey, a <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> song [...] "Hotel California", it’s a twisted journey.

2500|$|The first heart sound, or S1, {{forms the}} [...] "lub" [...] of [...] "lub-dub" [...] and is {{composed}} of components M1 (mitral valve closure) and T1 (tricuspid valve closure). Normally M1 precedes T1 slightly. It {{is caused by the}} [...] closure of the atrioventricular valves, i.e. tricuspid and mitral (bicuspid), at the beginning of ventricular contraction, or systole. When the ventricles begin to contract, so do the papillary muscles in each ventricle. The papillary muscles are attached to the cusps or leaflets of the tricuspid and mitral valves via chordae tendineae (heart strings). When the papillary muscles contract, the chordae tendineae become tense and thereby prevent the backflow of blood into the lower pressure environment of the atria. The chordae tendineae act a <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> strings on a parachute, and allow the leaflets of the valve to balloon up into the atria slightly, but not so much as to evert the cusp edges and allow back flow of blood. It is the pressure created from ventricular contraction that closes the valve, not the papillary muscles themselves. The contraction of the ventricle begins just prior to AV valves closing and prior to the semilunar valves opening. The sudden tensing of the chordae tendineae and the squeezing of the ventricles against closed semilunar valves, sends blood rushing back toward the atria, and the parachute-like valves catch the rush of blood in their leaflets causing the valve to snap shut. The S1 sound results from reverberation within the blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal by the valves. The delay of T1 even more than normally causes the split S1 which is heard in a right bundle branch blockage.|$|E
2500|$|Opinions {{differed}} about Fancourt's melodramatic {{style in}} his roles, especially {{his interpretation of}} his best-known role, that of the Mikado of Japan, and his famous Mikado laugh. Frederic Lloyd, who joined the D'Oyly Carte in 1951 and had studied the company's history, told an interviewer that Fancourt invented his interpretation, concerned that the earlier movements used during the Mikado's song could {{be taken as a}} Fagin-like caricature. [...] According to Lloyd, Fancourt had said that, because of his Jewish background, [...] "I just couldn't go through those movements, it would bother me", and Lloyd reported that, when Fancourt showed Rupert D'Oyly Carte and his stage director J. M. Gordon his new business for the song, they were delighted. Jessie Bond, who had played Pitti-Sing in the 1885 première, was unimpressed: [...] "Who, I want to know, intended that the Mikado should prance about like a madman, hissing out his lines like a serpent? ... The raving monster we so often see now is not one <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> suave and oily Mikado created [...] at the Savoy." [...] The Times thought that he [...] "undoubtedly loses {{a good deal of the}} Mikado's humour... his 'humane Mikado' scene is the one which seems to have travelled farthest from the 'Savoy tradition'." [...] A later Times review commented more favourably: [...] "Mr Darrell Fancourt... can (and did) add a terrifying aspect to the benignity of his humaner punishment manifesto, and left us wondering how his vocal cords ever managed to function normally after those expressions of emphasis with which he punctuated its paragraphs." [...] The Manchester Guardian praised Fancourt's fresh approach and added, [...] "He makes more of the punishment-fitting-the-crime song than we can remember having seen from any other actor." [...] The Pall Mall Gazette said, [...] "Mr Fancourt has recognised that people can do with a 'thrill' in these Grand Guignol days. So he has given us a Mikado who really does curdle the blood, with a voice like a steam hammer slowly crushing a ton of Brazil nuts, and a make up of ghastly villainy, and a fiendish, gurgling laugh, which must be heard to be appreciated." [...] Another critic described the sound of Fancourt's laugh as [...] "a dragon getting up steam". With respect to Fancourt's portrayal of the Pirate King, fellow actor Henry Lytton told an interviewer, [...] "The King should be a story book pirate, not a real one and blood thirsty to boot. But that's the way Mr. Fancourt plays it".|$|E
