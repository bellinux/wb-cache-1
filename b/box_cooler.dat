40|$|Freezing and melting {{phenomena}} {{are important}} in many different fields, including crystal growth, casting, metallurgy, geophysics, and oceanography. Solidification of a multi-component solution is the one often observed in nature. In order to investigate basic features of the freezing processes of binary systems, we {{conducted a series of}} laboratory experiments in a rectangular <b>box</b> <b>cooled</b> from above using aqueous NaNO 3 solution. During the freezing, the solid phase always grows into many needle-like crystals called the mushy layer. We measured the growth of the mushy layer thickness, the solid fraction, the temperature, and the concentration distributions. The average solid fraction is found to increase with time in the mushy layer. This causes a slow descent of the released solute in the mushy layer and its eventual fall into the liquid region below because of gravity. We propose a one-dimensional model to explain the horizontally-averaged mushy layer growth. In the model, the estimate of a heat flux at the mushy-liquid interface due to natural convection is found essential for a correct prediction. The proposed theory predicts well the growth of the mushy-layer and the average solid fraction, once the convective heat flux is properly given. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background With the {{increase}} in use of point-of-care diagnostic tests for malaria and other diseases comes the necessity of storing the diagnostic kits and the drugs required for subsequent management, in remote areas, where temperatures are high and electricity supply is unreliable or unavailable. Methods To address the lack of temperature-controlled storage during the introduction of community-based malaria management in Cambodia, the Cambodian National Centre for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control (CNM) developed prototype evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>boxes</b> (Cambodian <b>Cooler</b> <b>Boxes</b> - CCBs) for storage of perishable medical commodities in remote clinics. The performance of these CCBs for maintaining suitable storage temperatures was evaluated over two phases in 2005 and 2006 - 7, comparing conditions in CCBs using water as designed, CCBs with no water for evaporation, and ambient storage room temperatures. Temperature and humidity was monitored, together with {{the capacity of the}} RDTs recommended for storage between 2 to 30 degree Celsius to detect low-density malaria parasite samples after storage under these conditions. Results Significant differences were recorded between the proportion of temperatures within the recommended RDT storage conditions in the CCBs with water and the temperatures in the storage room (p Discussion and Conclusions The CCB was an effective tool for storage of RDTs at optimal conditions, and extended the effective life-span of the tests. The concept of evaporative cooling has potential to greatly enhance access to perishable diagnostics and medicines in remote communities, as it allows prolonged storage at low cost using locally-available materials, in the absence of electricity. </p...|$|R

40|$|Evaporative cooling systems using a {{combination}} of evaporative pads and extractor fans require greenhouses to be hermetic. The greatest concentration of greenhouses in the world is located in southeast Spain, but these tend not to be hermetic structures and consequently can only rely on fogging systems as evaporative cooling techniques. Evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>boxes</b> provide an alternative to such systems. Using a low-speed wind tunnel, the present work has compared the performance of this system with four pads of differing geometry and thickness manufactured by two different companies. The results obtained show that the plastic packing in the cooling unit produces a pressure drop of 11. 05 Pa at 2 m·s− 1, which is between 51. 27 % and 94. 87 % lower than that produced by the cellulose pads. This pressure drop was not influenced by increases in the water flow. The evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>boxes</b> presented greater saturation efficiency at the same flow, namely 82. 63 %, as opposed to an average figure of 65 % for the cellulose pads; and also had a lower specific consumption of water, at around 3. 05 L·h− 1 ·m− 2 ·°C− 1. Consequently, we conclude that evaporative <b>cooling</b> <b>boxes</b> are a good option for cooling non-hermetic greenhouses such as those most frequently used in the Mediterranean basin.
