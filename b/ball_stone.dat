40|$|We give another {{success story}} of using kernel-based methods {{to solve a}} {{difficult}} reinforcement learning problem, namely that of 3 vs 2 keepaway in RoboCup simulated soccer. Key challenges in keepaway are the high-dimensionality of the state space (rendering conventional grid-based function approximation like tilecoding infeasable) and the stochasticity due to noise and multiple learning agents needing to cooperate. We use approximate policy iteration with sparsified regularization networks to carry out policy evaluation. Preliminary {{results indicate that the}} behavior learned through our approach clearly outperforms the best results obtained with tilecoding by Stone et al. [5]. 1 The Keepaway problem RoboCup is a multi-agent domain with two opposing teams of agents struggling to beat the other one in a game of simulated soccer. Agents are autonomous entities; they sense and act independently and asynchronously, run as individual processes and cannot directly communicate. Each agent only has a restricted view of the world (hidden states). In addition, random noise affects both the agents sensors as well as their actuators (stochasticity). State description consists of relative distances and angles to visible objects in the world, such as the ball, other agents or fixed beacons for localization (high dimensionality). And finally the agents must make their decisions in real-time. These properties make RoboCup a more than worthy challenge for current reinforcement learning (RL). Here, we consider a subtask of the full problem, namely the 3 vs 2 keepaway problem. In keepaway we have two smaller teams: one team (3 keepers) must try to maintain possession of the ball as long as possible while staying within a tight rectangular space. The other team (2 takers) tries to gain possession of the <b>ball.</b> <b>Stone</b> et al. [5] formulated keepaway as RL benchmark problem; 1 the keepers must learn how to maximize the time they control the ball (as a team!) against the team of opposing takers playing a fixed strategy. However, each keeper only learns individually from its own (noisy...|$|E

50|$|Naturally formed <b>stone</b> <b>balls,</b> such as concretions and spherulites, {{have been}} at times misidentified as petrospheres. For example, fringe archaeologists and advocates of prehistoric {{extraterrestrial}} visitors have repeatedly argued that the <b>stone</b> <b>balls,</b> which range in diameter from 0.61 to 3.35 m, found around Cerro Piedras Bola in the Sierra de Ameca, between Ahualulco de Mercado and Ameca, in Jalisco, Mexico, are petrospheres. However, these natural <b>stone</b> <b>balls</b> are megaspherulites that have been released by erosion from a 20- to 30-million-year-old ash flow tuff, which originally enclosed them and in which they formed. The proponents of these <b>stone</b> <b>balls</b> being petrospheres base their arguments on the false claims {{that all of these}} spheres are perfectly round, they are composed of granite, and natural processes cannot produce <b>stone</b> <b>balls.</b> Similarly, cannonball concretions, i.e. those found along the Cannonball River in North Dakota and near Moeraki, South Island, New Zealand, also have been misidentified as petrospheres.|$|R

25|$|In the Sierra de Ameca between Ahualulco de Mercado and Ameca, Jalisco, a {{large number}} of stone spheres, many of which are almost {{perfectly}} spherical, can be found. Their generally spherical shape led people to suspect they were manmade <b>stone</b> <b>balls,</b> called petrospheres, created by an unknown culture. In 1967, Stirling examined these stone spheres in the field. As a result of this examination, he and his colleagues hypothesized that they were of geological origin. A later expedition and subsequent petrographic and other laboratory analyses of samples of the <b>stone</b> <b>balls</b> confirmed this suspicion. Their interpretation of the data collected in both field and laboratory is that these <b>stone</b> <b>balls</b> were formed by high temperature nucleation of glassy material within an ashfall tuff, as a result of tertiary volcanism.|$|R

40|$|Introduction In this chapter, {{we present}} a general {{methodology}} for simulating the life and behavior of creatures and their reaction to their environment. In a larger sense, we can attribute a behavior to each object. Dead objects, like <b>balls,</b> <b>stones,</b> [...] . move (behave) in their environment according to physical laws. Plants, as all other living creatures, obey also Newton's laws (gravitation, wind, [...] ), but besides, they grow, reproduce themselves and react to their environment (light, temperature, [...] .). The behavior of animals is in addition influenced by emotional and instinctive components. Males and females are attracted by each other, or as an other example, a predator is attracted by his victim, which {{on the other hand}} is repelled by the predator. For most of the humans and a lot of animals their behavior is strongly determined by their vision, which is a very important channel, by which the environment is perceived. Finally, the highest level of behavior includes intelligence...|$|R
