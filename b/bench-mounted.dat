Wavelength coverage is 370 to 950 nm and spectral resolution 1, 000 - 8, 000 in multi-Object mode, or 1, 500 - 10, 000 in IFU mode. Multi-object mode was commissioned in January 2006 and the IFU system will be commissioned in June 2006. The spectrograph is located off the telescope in a thermally isolated room and the 2 dF fibres have been replaced by new 38 m broadband fibres. Despite the increased fibre length, we have achieved a large increase in throughput by use of VPH gratings, more efficient coatings and new detectors - amounting to a factor of at least 2 in the red. The number of spectral resolution elements and the maximum resolution are both more than doubled, and the stability is an order of magnitude better. The spectrograph comprises: an f/ 3. 15 Schmidt collimator, incorporating a dichroic beam-splitter; interchangeable VPH gratings; and articulating red and blue f/ 1. 3 Schmidt cameras.

By combining the HET data with recent observations from the Mercator telescope, we are able to calculate precise orbital solutions for three systems using more than 6 years of observations. We also present an up-to-date period histogram for all known hot subdwarf binaries, which suggests those with F-K main sequence companions tend to have orbital periods on the order of several years. Such long periods challenge the predictions of conventional BPS models, although a larger sample is needed for a thorough assessment of the models' predictive success.

40|$|Sensors {{demonstrate}} huge {{potential in}} civil engineering for monitoring the health condition {{and performance of}} concrete structures. Amongst various chemical deterioration mechanisms causing inadequate durability of concrete structures, carbonation {{is one of the}} most severe mechanisms. It occurs from the chemical reactions between intruded CO 2 and calcium-bearing phases, hence is accompanied by the formation of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and the decrease of the alkalinity of concrete pore solution, causing corrosion of rebar in concrete. Thus, detecting carbonation process, especially, determining the carbonation profile (i. e. the content of carbonation products formed against the depth into concrete structure), is of great importance to the diagnosis of the health condition of concrete structures and the prediction of service life. Unfortunately, existing sensors for health monitoring systems suffer from various limitations. Optical fibre Raman technology offers a unique opportunity for developing a novel chemical sensor system capable of monitoring the service-condition of concrete in situ. In the current work, a bespoke ‘coaxial’ optical fibre sensing platform based on Raman spectroscopy was successfully established with a 514. 5 nm laser. All the optics were tailored for efficiently exciting and receiving signals from cementitious materials, and their diameters were restricted within 0. 5 inch in order to explore the feasibility of developing an embeddable miniature sensor system in the future. This sensing system was then employed to detect the carbonation mechanism of a plain Portland cement (PC) paste. The calcium carbonate polymorphs as well as the carbonation profile in the PC paste was successfully recognised and established with the results being verified favourably by <b>bench-mounted</b> Raman, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Thermogravimetry (TG) analyses. Our results demonstrate a good potential for developing a novel Raman spectroscopy based optical fibre sensor system for monitoring the health condition and the performance concrete structures in future...|$|E
40|$|PEPSI is the <b>bench-mounted,</b> two-arm, fibre-fed and {{stabilized}} Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument for the 2 × 8. 4 m Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). Three spectral {{resolutions of}} either 43 000, 120 000 or 270 000 can {{cover the entire}} optical/red wavelength range from 383 to 907 nm in three exposures. Two 10. 3 k× 10. 3 k CCDs with 9 -µm pixels and peak quantum efficiencies of 94 – 96 % record a total of 92 échelle orders. We introduce a new variant of a wave-guide image slicer with 3, 5, and 7 slices and peak efficiencies between 92 – 96 %. A total of six cross dispersers cover the six wavelength settings of the spectrograph, two of them always simultaneously. These are made of a VPH-grating sandwiched by two prisms. The peak efficiency of the system, including the telescope, is 15 % at 650 nm, and still 11 % and 10 % at 390 nm and 900 nm, respectively. In combination with the 110 m 2 light-collecting capability of the LBT, we expect a limiting magnitude of ≈ 20 th mag in V in the low-resolution mode. The R = 120 000 mode {{can also be used}} with two, dual-beam Stokes IQUV polarimeters. The 270 000 -mode is made possible with the 7 -slice image slicer and a 100 -µm fibre through a projected sky aperture of 0. 74 ″, comparable to the median seeing of the LBT site. The 43 000 -mode with 12 -pixel sampling per resolution element is our bad seeing or faint-object mode. Any of the three resolution modes can either be used with sky fibers for simultaneous sky exposures or with light from a stabilized Fabry-Pérot étalon for ultra-precise radial velocities. CCD-image processing is performed with the dedicated data-reduction and analysis package PEPSI-S 4 S. Its full error propagation through all image-processing steps allows an adaptive selection of parameters by using statistical inferences and robust estimators. A solar feed makes use of PEPSI during day time and a 500 -m feed from the 1. 8 m VATT can be used when the LBT is busy otherwise. In this paper, we present the basic instrument design, its realization, and its characteristics. Some pre-commissioning first-light spectra shall demonstrate the basic functionality...|$|E
