25|$|By 2005 NorskeCanada had {{operated}} with {{a deficit}} in 13 of 19 quarters, and Norske Skog started considering its {{options for the}} company. Pöyry was hired to consider the operations, {{and concluded that the}} mills were not competitive for export to Asia, a prime target market for Norske Skog. The paper particularly emphasized inefficient mill designs which subsequently led to higher operating costs. The first step was taken in October 2005, when the general meeting approved the new name, Catalyst Paper, to signal that the group was leaving Norske Skog. The Norwegian group sold its 29.4 percent of Catalyst for $186 million in a <b>bought</b> <b>deal</b> on 30 January 2006. At the time Catalyst's four mills made it North America's fourth-largest producer of printing papers, with an annual production of two million tonnes of paper and half a million tonnes of kraft pulp.|$|E

5000|$|The {{advantage}} of the <b>bought</b> <b>deal</b> from the issuer's perspective {{is that they do}} not have to worry about financing risk (the risk that the financing can only be done at a discount too steep to market price.) This is in contrast to a fully marketed offering, where the underwriters have to [...] "market" [...] the offering to prospective buyers, only after which the price is set.|$|E
50|$|The {{disadvantage}} of the <b>bought</b> <b>deal</b> from the underwriter's perspective {{is that if}} it cannot sell the securities, it must hold them. This is usually {{the result of the}} market price falling below the issue price, which means the underwriter loses money. The underwriter also uses up its capital, which would probably otherwise be put to better use (given sell-side investment banks are not usually in the business of buying new issues of securities).|$|E
5000|$|A <b>bought</b> <b>deal</b> is {{one form}} of {{financial}} arrangement often associated with an Initial Public Offering. It occurs when an underwriter, such as an investment bank or a syndicate, purchases securities from an issuer before a preliminary prospectus is filed. The investment bank (or underwriter) acts as principal rather than agent and thus actually [...] "goes long" [...] in the security. The bank negotiates a price with the issuer (usually at a discount to the current market price, if applicable).|$|E

40|$|The <b>bought</b> <b>deal</b> is the {{predominant}} method of underwriting SEOs in Canada. Offer prices are set and underwriters commit to purchase offerings several days earlier for bought deals than for firm commitment issues, implying stronger underwriter certification for <b>bought</b> <b>deal</b> issues. Consistent with the certification hypothesis, this study finds a significantly smaller negative stock price reaction around {{the announcement of}} bought deals compared to firm commitment issues. Bought deals are further shown to have smaller offer price discounts and smaller underwriting fees, implying superior pricing and thus, higher quality offerings. These findings suggest that investment banks' underwriting method of choice is informative of issue quality. SEOs <b>Bought</b> <b>deal</b> Information asymmetry Underwriter certification...|$|E

50|$|A <b>bought</b> out <b>deal</b> is {{a method}} of {{offering}} securities to the public through a sponsor (a bank, financial institution, or an individual). The securities are listed {{in one or more}} stock exchanges within a time frame mutually agreed upon by the company and the sponsor. This option saves the issuing company the costs and time involved in a public issue. The cost of holding the shares can be reimbursed by the company, or the sponsor can offer the shares to the public at a premium to earn profits. Terms are agreed upon by the company and the sponsor.|$|R
5000|$|Childs <b>bought</b> a great <b>deal</b> {{of land in}} {{the area}} around Floral Park.

The trio built 12 hotels before in 1986 Zecha sold his 30% stake for $30 million. He then moved into real estate speculation, forming an investment fund that, among other <b>deals,</b> <b>bought</b> Bangkok's Regent Hotel and London's Dorchester Hotel before eventually on selling them.|$|R
5000|$|Early in {{his life}} Cameron sought a career in politics, but after a bitter {{election}} and accusation of corruption in 1854, Cameron’s interest in politics came to an end. [...] Cameron then <b>bought</b> a great <b>deal</b> of land in Essex County {{and was forced to}} borrow money from his father-in-law to pay the mortgage when the land value did not increase. Cameron also leased Talbot road in Essex County after the municipality sought to lease main roads to toll companies. [...] In the 1870s Cameron’s business dealings finally became profitable. He bought land in Essex County that was adjacent to railways and becoming increasingly valuable.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{the first}} of several {{pleasant}} evenings, and Mr. Price, who had <b>bought</b> a book <b>dealing</b> with Australia from a second-hand bookstall, no longer denied them an account of his adventures there. A gold watch and chain, which had made a serious hole in his brother-in-law's Savings Bank account, lent an air of substance to his waistcoat, and a pin of excellent paste sparkled in his neck-tie. Under the influence of good food and home comforts he improved every day, and the unfortunate Mr. Spriggs was at his wits' end to resist further encroachments. From the second day of their acquaintance he called Mr. Potter [...] "Alf," [...] and the young people listened with great attention to his discourse on [...] "Money: How to Make It and How to Keep It." ...|$|R
25|$|The new {{department}} of Beckman Instruments took the name Shockley Semi-Conductor Laboratories (the hyphen was conventional in those years). During 1955 Beckman and Shockley signed the <b>deal,</b> <b>bought</b> licenses on all necessary patents for $25,000, and selected the location in Mountain View, near Palo Alto, California. The place did not prove very successful: Shockley's colleagues at Bell Labs and RCA refused {{to move to}} a rural location with no long-distance phone service. The vast majority of semiconductor-related companies and professionals were based on the East Coast, so Shockley posted ads in The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune. Early respondents included Sheldon Roberts of Dow Chemical, Robert Noyce of Philco and Jay Last, a former intern of Beckman Instruments. The newspaper campaign brought some three hundred responses, and fifteen people, including Gordon Moore and David Allison, Shockley himself recruited {{at a meeting of the}} American Physical Society.|$|R
2500|$|As a teenager, she {{formed a}} folk rock band named The Breeders with her sister. She {{then became a}} {{prolific}} songwriter, as she {{found it easier to}} write songs than cover them.

We were just {{trying to figure out how}} blue rhymes with you. When I was writing them, they didn't have anything to do with who I was." [...] The <b>Deals</b> <b>bought</b> microphones, an eight-track tape recorder, a mixer, speakers, and amps for a bedroom studio.

50|$|In 1874 John Lewis Childs {{arrived in}} the area to work for C.L. Allen as a seed seller. After {{building}} his own seed and bulb business and starting America's first seed catalog business, Childs <b>bought</b> a great <b>deal</b> of land in the area. To promote his own business and the local horticultural industry, Childs named the local streets after flowers and renamed the area Floral Park. The expansion of the Floral Park Post Office and nearby village businesses are attributed solely to the success of Childs' business. When the local Post Office took the name Floral Park, the Long Island Rail Road followed suit by changing the name of the East Hinsdale station to Floral Park in 1888. Formerly part of Queens, Floral Park became part of the new county of Nassau in 1899, and it was incorporated as a village in 1908. Childs served as its first president starting that year.|$|R
