25|$|One of {{the driving}} {{requirements}} for the new trainer will be to help prepare pilots for the increased complexity in some areas, particularly information management, that {{are a part of}} fifth generation jet fighters like the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II. The Air Force first viewed this as unnecessary and costly, but industry analysis showed it to be cheaper in the long run. The aircraft and simulation system will have to fulfill several basic training roles; <b>basic</b> <b>aircraft</b> control, airmanship, formation, instrument and navigation, advanced air-to-air, advanced air-to-ground, and advanced crew/cockpit resource management. Furthermore, there are five advanced training roles that the system is expected to fulfill; sustained high-G operations at 6.5–7.5g, aerial refueling, night vision imaging systems operations, air-to-air intercepts, and data-link operations. The 2009 Request For Information (RFI) mentions that some tasks, such as aerial refueling, may be performed in the simulator and not on the aircraft itself. Aircraft availability is to be 80%, but not higher, as that would drive cost too high. Program requirements focus on life-cycle costs rather than just purchase price.|$|E
25|$|Low-drag {{conformal}} {{fuel tanks}} (CFTs) were {{developed for the}} F-15C and D models. They can {{be attached to the}} sides of the engine air intakes under each wing and are designed to the same load factors and airspeed limits as the <b>basic</b> <b>aircraft.</b> These conformal tanks slightly degrade performance by increasing aerodynamic drag and cannot be jettisoned in-flight. However they cause less drag than conventional external tanks. Each conformal tank can hold 750 U.S. gallons (2,840 L) of fuel. These tanks increase range and reduce the need for in-flight refueling. All external stations for munitions remain available with the tanks in use. Moreover, Sparrow or AMRAAM missiles can be attached to the corners of the conformal fuel tanks. The 57 FIS based at Keflavik NAS, Iceland was the only C-model squadron to use CFTs on a regular basis due to its extended operations over the North Atlantic. With the closure of the 57 FIS, the F-15E is the only variant to carry them on a routine basis. CFTs have also been sold to Israel and Saudi Arabia.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the project definition phase in May 1970, the concepts were reduced to two designs; a single seat Panavia 100 which West Germany initially preferred, and the twin-seat Panavia 200 which the RAF preferred (this would become the Tornado). The aircraft was briefly called the Panavia Panther, and the project soon coalesced towards the two-seat option. In September 1971, the three governments signed an Intention to Proceed (ITP) document, at which point the aircraft was intended solely for the low-level strike mission, where it was viewed as a viable threat to Soviet defences in that role. It was at this point that Britain's Chief of the Defence Staff announced [...] "two-thirds of the fighting front line will be composed of this single, <b>basic</b> <b>aircraft</b> type".|$|E

2500|$|There is {{apprehension}} {{that the}} FGFA would significantly exceed its current $6 billion budget, because this figure reflects the expenditure on just the <b>basic</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Crucial avionics systems would cost extra. The Russian and Indian air forces each planned to purchase about 250 FGFAs, {{at an estimated}} $100 million per fighter for an $25 billion total, {{in addition to the}} development costs. [...] By October 2012, India had cut its total purchase size from 200 to 144 aircraft. [...] India's initial investment had grown from $5 billion to $6 billion, and the estimated total programme cost had grown to $30 billion in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Initially {{training}} {{was done by}} short 'hops' in primary gliders which are very <b>basic</b> <b>aircraft</b> with no cockpit and minimal instruments. [...] Since shortly after World War II training has always been done in two-seat dual control gliders, but [...] high performance two-seaters are also used to share the workload and the enjoyment of long flights. Originally skids were used for landing, but the majority now land on wheels, often retractable. Some gliders, known as motor gliders, are designed for unpowered flight, but can deploy piston, rotary, jet or electric engines. Gliders are classified by the FAI for competitions into glider competition classes mainly {{on the basis of}} span and flaps.|$|E
