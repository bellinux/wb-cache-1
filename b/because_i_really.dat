5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> thought it was over to me.|$|E
500|$|The San Diego Padres drafted Hamilton eighth {{overall in}} the 1991 Major League Baseball draft, making him the highest drafted Atlantic Sun Conference {{baseball}} player in the league's history. He eventually {{signed a contract with}} the Padres worth $415,000 after a short period in which Hamilton refused to sign a contract. He was surprised upon hearing of his selection, saying [...] "It came as a bit of a shock <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> hadn't heard much from the Padres." [...] According to Hamilton's mother, Hamilton only signed the deal because his father Jack was dying of cancer, and it had been his father's dream to watch his son pitch in the major leagues. Following the draft, Hamilton joined Team USA in Canada in preparation for the Olympics.|$|E
500|$|American singer Christina Aguilera rose to {{prominence}} {{with the success}} of her 1999 self-titled debut album. It topped the US Billboard 200 and was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It produced three Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: [...] "Genie in a Bottle", [...] "What a Girl Wants", and [...] "Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)". Despite the success, Aguilera was displeased with being marketed as her then-manager Steve Kurtz desired, and felt unable to control her image. She told The Sydney Morning Herald her dissatisfaction with being a part of the late 1990s teen pop trend, [...] "The label [...] wanted to push the cookie-cutter, [...] almost virginal kind of imagery that wasn't me," [...] Aguilera said. [...] "I really wanted to squirm away from that, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> thought it was really fake and superficial and untrue of what I was about." ...|$|E

5000|$|To {{compliment}} Electronic Dream's {{sound and}} success, AraabMuzik {{began working on}} a full length official album Dream World, slated for a 2015 release. However, it ended up being delayed numerous times; he was quoted saying [...] "I pushed it back so <b>I</b> could still <b>really</b> perfect it and work on it more, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>really</b> feel like <b>I</b> was satisfied with it." ...|$|R
500|$|Fourth-place {{finisher}} Junqueira felt {{he could}} have won the race had a caution flag not been displayed. Franchitti was disappointed not to finish: [...] "It's such a shame <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> think we had {{a shot at the}} million dollars. We weren't really stretching the engine, either. We were just cruising along. We didn't want to lead the thing because of fuel consumption. We were running in the draft, looking real good." [...] Despite his crash on lap 196, Fernández was pleased with his car as he felt comfortable driving along the race track: [...] "We were having a great race. This {{was one of the best}} cars I have had at a superspeedway." [...] Bräck stated his car experienced oversteer while driving alongside other competitors but felt his car ran efficiently. Tracy said his engine failure was a [...] "disappointment" [...] for his team and felt he had a car that could win the race. He said the event summed up a [...] "season of frustration" [...] but affirmed that his team would refocus and prepare for 2002. Autosport described it as similar to [...] "a NASCAR restrictor plate race" [...] because the cars often drove two or three abreast while racing in packs.|$|E
500|$|When {{talking about}} [...] "On the Floor", during an {{interview}} with MTV, Lopez said that she wanted a song that would evolve her sound, [...] "it feels like me today, which I like. It's not something that you hear and you're like, 'That's not her,' but you also go, 'Is that her? I like that. It's new,' and that's what I wanted. I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started. Since I was a little girl, I just totally connected with the idea of getting out there." ...|$|E
500|$|A pre-taped {{performance}} of Brown performing {{a medley of}} [...] "Beautiful People" [...] and [...] "Forever" [...] was shown on the American version of Dancing with the Stars on March 29, 2011. For the performance Brown wore {{a black and white}} suit, and was accompanied by a group of robotic dancers dressed in all-white suits adorned with LED lighting for a futuristic Tron-like affect. Prior to the performance some of the show's cast were unhappy that Brown was going to perform because of the domestic violence assault that occurred with his then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. Brown was sentenced to five years of probation, ordered to complete more than 1,400 hours of community service and was given a restraining order which required him to stay away from Rihanna. Professional dancer Cheryl Burke told Extra, [...] "As a victim of domestic violence, I don't agree with him coming on the show, but it's out of my control", while host Tom Bergeron told the On Air with Ryan Seacrest radio show that, [...] "I did tell the producers it may be to their advantage to not have me interview him, because my natural tendency would be to say something. So don't put me in a position where you are asking me to not say something, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> won't do that." ...|$|E
5000|$|Planningtorock {{has stated}} that the {{distortion}} of her vocals allows for the [...] "playing around with gender alongside communicating what I feel is the emotions within the songs. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> am <b>really</b> interested in expanding upon the limits {{that we live in}} - how we are defined - and it is an experiment." ...|$|R

500|$|Azaria did {{not expect}} to hear from the show again, but they {{continued}} to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He felt that, initially, [...] " [...] didn't seem too pleased with what I had done... was very exacting... was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I {{thought it was going to}} be my last week <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> didn't think I had done that well." [...] Nevertheless, by the show's second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. Since he joined later than the rest of the cast, Groening still considered Azaria the [...] "new guy". In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, Lou, Snake Jailbird, Kirk Van Houten, the Sea Captain, Superintendent Chalmers, Disco Stu, Duffman, the Wiseguy and numerous one-time characters. His co-star in The Simpsons, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: [...] "The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star." ...|$|E
500|$|A pre-taped {{performance}} of Brown performing [...] "Yeah 3x" [...] and {{a medley of}} [...] "Beautiful People" [...] and [...] "Forever" [...] was shown on the American version of Dancing with the Stars on March 29, 2011. For the performance, Brown wore a tomato red tuxedo and a black shirt and bow tie. The performance started off with a young boy doing break dancing moves and announcing, 'Here is Chris Brown'. Brown then appeared doing flips and somersaults, as he lip-synced most of the song. The performance earned him a standing ovation from the judges {{and members of the}} crowd. Prior to the performance, some of the show's cast were unhappy that Brown was going to perform because of the domestic violence assault that occurred with his then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. Brown was sentenced to five years of probation, ordered to complete more than 1,400 hours of community service and was given a restraining order which required him to stay away from Rihanna.

500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked why}} she portrays hares she replied, [...] "Well, I find it {{difficult}} answering that question <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>really</b> know the answer. It's the same as asking me why I make sculpture, and the answer is, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> feel driven to. So it's difficult to always pin down reasons. My introduction to hares was when my lurcher dog would proudly bring hares home and drop them at my feet." ...|$|R
5000|$|In October, Del Rey {{said about}} the {{prospect}} of a new album, [...] "When people ask me about it, I just have to be honest—I <b>really</b> don't know. <b>I</b> don't want to say, 'Yeah, definitely—the next one's better than this one', <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>really</b> hear a next one. My muse is very fickle. She only comes to me sometimes, which is annoying." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} in 2016, Trainor claimed she's a feminist: [...] "I’d been told: 'Don’t say you’re something if you don’t know what it is.' So I was like: 'Well, I’m not a feminist,' <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn’t <b>really</b> understand it and then I was like 'Oh shit, obviously I am a feminist. My songs are women’s anthems across the board.'" [...]|$|R
2500|$|Zelle wrote several {{letters to}} the Dutch Ambassador in Paris, {{claiming}} her innocence. [...] "My international connections are due of my work as a dancer, nothing else.... <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> did not spy, it is terrible that I cannot defend myself". The most terrible and heart-breaking moment for Mata Hari during the trial occurred when her lover Maslov – by now a deeply embittered man {{as a result of}} losing his eyes in combat – declined to testify for her, telling her he couldn't care less if she were convicted or not. It was reported that Zelle fainted when she learned that Maslov had abandoned her.|$|E
2500|$|At St Peter's, Connolly {{decided he}} wanted to make people laugh. [...] "I can {{remember}} the moment in the school playground. I would have been 7 or 8. And I was sitting in a puddle and people were laughing. I had fallen in it and people found it funny. And it wasn't all that uncomfortable, so I stayed in it longer than I normally would <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> enjoyed the laughing. My life was very unhappy at the time, and laughter wasn't something I heard all the time, so it was a joy. And I realised quickly that if you can have an audience this way, life was rather pleasant." [...] While at St Peter's, Connolly joined a gang. His arch-enemy was Geordie Sinclair, who lived around the corner.|$|E
2500|$|One of Crosby's songwriting {{contributions}} to the album, [...] "What's Happening?!?!", began his penchant for writing abstract songs asking irresoluble questions, a trend that has continued throughout his career with Crosby, Stills & Nash and as a solo artist. During a 1966 interview, Crosby admitted {{that it was a}} strange song, noting [...] "It asks questions of what's going on here and who does it all belong to and why is it all going on. I just ask the questions <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> don't know the answers." [...] Like [...] "Eight Miles High", the song exhibits the strong influence of Indian classical music with its droning guitar and melody. [...] "What's Happening?!?!" [...] is also notable for being the first song written solely by Crosby to appear on a Byrds' record.|$|E
60|$|The old {{man must}} have {{understood}} that I spoke rather from nervousness than <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was <b>really</b> in anger, and immediately he {{acted as if}} nothing unpleasant had been said, but began to discuss {{the question of whether}} {{it would be wise to}} burden ourselves with weapons when, if brought to bay, we could not hope to fight our way through.|$|R
5000|$|In {{previous}} studies, {{the construction}} {{and the number of}} item inventory of perceived behavioral control have depended on each particular health topic. For example, for smoking topics, it is usually measured by items such as [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> am addicted <b>because</b> <b>I</b> can <b>really</b> just not smoke and not crave for it," [...] and [...] "It would be really easy for me to quit." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ghose, {{and other}} Indian journalists like Barkha Dutt, have been victim to abuse and {{trolling}} {{on social media}} sites like Twitter. Ghose said she stopped posting her views and fearing {{for the safety of}} her daughter. She said, [...] "It was very disturbing. I didn't know what to do. So for a few days I had her picked up and dropped off to school in our car and not via public transport, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was <b>really</b> scared." ...|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the album}} {{listening}} party, Spin described the album as having no ballads except [...] "Body Party" [...] whilst John Kennedy, writing for Vibe, described the album as [...] "feel-good midtempo" [...] songs akin to Ciara's Goodies era (circa 2004). In {{an interview with}} MTV News Ciara said that creating her fifth album was the most personal experience of her career thus far. She elaborated that she had asked close friend and collaborator Missy Elliott to review her early progress on Ciara, [...] "I always share my projects with her early. I'll go to her house and play her the records really early in the process, and it's always so cool, but I just have to pinch myself in moments when I see her a lot. I'll be like, 'OK, this is really my friend,' but it's dope <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> respect her. She's done something in music {{that no one has}} done {{and when you look at}} her old references and just her references period, you wonder what the mind of that person is, and she's my friend, so I get to get a little bit more out of that mind, and it's really cool." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} track, [...] "Staying Alive", {{was written}} and produced by Jay R Sillona and Keith Martin under Sillona's own recording label, Homeworkz Records. The song uses Auto-Tune, and features rap verses by Q-York and additional back-up vocals by beauty queen Krista Kleiner, who was Sillona's {{partner at the}} time. It marked {{the second time that}} Nina collaborated with Sillona, since their duet of [...] "Muli" [...] in early 2010. The song is described as [...] "another smoking track with bold and powerful lyrics: 'I shouldn't let them knock me down down down... I'm staying alive.'" [...] "However Much Love" [...] is an acoustic flute-driven song, considered as one of Nina's distinctly slow and sentimental ballads in the album. The lyrics speak of steadfast and unconditional love. Philippine Entertainment Portal called it a [...] "standout," [...] stating [...] "Nina's voice heightens the pain and vulnerability evoked by the lyrics and melody." [...] "Believe in the Dream" [...] is an inspirational power ballad, written by Jude Gitamondoc. Nina insisted the song's inclusion with the purpose of encouraging her listeners to pursue their goals despite adversities. Its message is about not giving up on your dreams. Nina related the lyrics to her personal struggles, saying [...] "That's important for me <b>because</b> <b>I,</b> <b>really,</b> almost gave up [...] If this is what you always wanted to do, if this is your dream, don't lose hope. Go for it. Me, I almost gave up and if not for my faith and belief in God, I would have lost the hope that was left. So, just really keep on reaching for your dreams." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Father Brown simply, {{and stood}} up also, [...] "you won't take it by force. First, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> haven't still got it. And, second, {{because we are not}} alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do it {{for several}} reasons," [...] he answered. [...] "First, because misanthropy is a luxury in which I cannot afford to indulge. Secondly, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am <b>really</b> curious {{to know whether the}} time will ever return when I shall feel the {{slightest}} shadow of interest in any human being. I can only discover this by affecting a toleration for these people's society, which I can assure you, if you are curious about the matter, is wholly assumed." ...|$|R

5000|$|About {{the process}} of writing songs, Cetera has said, I'm like the very bad student who only studies the day before a test! I only tend to write songs when I have a purpose - I need to know that I'm going to do a new album, and then I would start writing. There are not a lot of Peter Cetera songs lying around, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>really</b> write a lot of things when I'm not {{expected}} to do an album! ...|$|R

5000|$|In a 2001 interview, Drew told {{entertainment}} writer Margaret Martin of the Shreveport Times that {{he began}} his musical career by [...] "tinkering with the keyboard by ear <b>because</b> <b>I</b> never <b>really</b> learned to read music. I'm not talented, but I'm diligent." [...] Martin noticed that Drew keeps a keyboard on his desk. The walls of his office are filled with law books and portraits of his grandfather and great-grandfather, both of whom once held the judgeship that he occupies.|$|R

5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 13 laps to go. Logano dove underneath Kyle Larson {{going into}} turn 1 and Larson {{ended up in}} the wall with three laps to go. Larson said afterwards that he [...] "was able to clear them and I thought I would pull away pretty easily <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was <b>really</b> good on short runs.
