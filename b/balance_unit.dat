30|$|This paper {{presents}} a renewable energy accommodation capacity calculation model considering utilization level of inter-provincial and inter-regional tie-lines, {{which is based}} on renewable energy time series production simulation [20]. Under given load conditions, operation of each generator set is simulated. The load and unit output of power grid are regarded as time series varying with time, and renewable energy output is simulated. Then some operation indices of power grid within a certain period can be calculated. This kind of production simulation process needs to consider various constraints such as load <b>balance,</b> <b>unit</b> climbing, power flow limit and so on. Generally, the objective function is to maximize accommodation capacity of renewable energy or to optimize the economic performance of grid, and optimal simulation results can be obtained, which conform to actual power system operation. Time series production simulation {{plays an important role in}} operation and decision-making of power generation system. Short-term production simulation usually ranges from a few hours to a week, which can provide a reasonable generation plan for dispatching department. Long-term production simulation time ranges several months or years, which can be used as reference basis of power grid planning and construction.|$|E

It uses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that can either be embedded inside a dynamically unstable platform for balance measurement or mounted on the lower back of a human participant for gait analysis. Methods and ResultsThe acceleration data along three Cartesian coordinates is analyzed by the gait-force model to extract bio-mechanics information in both the dynamic state as in the gait analyzer and the steady state as in the balance scale. For the gait analyzer, the simple, noninvasive and versatile approach makes it appealing to {{a broad range of}} applications in clinical diagnosis, rehabilitation monitoring, athletic training, sport-apparel design, and many other areas. For the balance scale, it provides a portable platform to measure the postural deviation and the balance index under visual or vestibular sensory input conditions. Despite its simple construction and operation, excellent agreement has been demonstrated between its performance and the high-cost commercial <b>balance</b> <b>unit</b> over a wide dynamic range. ConclusionThe portable balance scale is an ideal tool for routine monitoring of balance index, fall-risk assessment, and other balance-related health issues for both clinical and household use...|$|E
40|$|The {{real-time}} planning visualisation, precise allocation and loading optimisation in {{air cargo}} load planning operations are increasingly important as more considerations are needed on dangerous cargo loading, locations of lithium batteries, weight declaration and limited aircraft capacity. The planning {{of the unit}} load devices (ULD) can often be carried out only in {{a limited number of}} hours before flight departure. A dynamic air cargo load planning system is proposed with the optimisation of cargo load plan and visualisation of planning results in virtual reality systems.

Adopting simulation tools, Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) and virtual reality technologies, the results of planning with reference to weight and <b>balance,</b> <b>Unit</b> Load Device (ULD) dimensions, gateway, cargo nature and aircraft capacity are optimised and presented.

Using the balance model PROTERRA-S, we assessed the phosphorus (P), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) flux balances in agricultural soils of a rural region in Switzerland for different farm types and crop types. The P requirements of crops on arable farms were mainly supplied by commercial fertilizers and sewage sludge, while on animal husbandry farms P fertilizer demands were met by animal manure alone. Metal accumulation in soil was very different between the <b>balance</b> <b>units.</b> Estimated net Cd fluxes ranged between 1. 0 and 2. 3 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for arable farm types, 0. 6 and 2. 0 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for dairy and mixed farm types, and 9. 1 and 17. 8 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for animal husbandry farm types. Largest net Zn fluxes of 17. 9 - 39. 8 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1) were estimated for animal husbandry farms, whereas for arable farm types net Zn fluxes of 101 - 260 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) and for dairy and mixed farm types of 349 - 3360 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) were found. The results indicate that P management is a primary factor determining the variation of these net Cd and net Zn fluxes. The latter were highly sensitive to the Zn/P concentration ratio in animal manure, atmospheric deposition and crop concentrations. Variation of net Cd fluxes resulted mainly from uncertainty in crop concentrations, atmospheric deposition, leaching parameters and uncertainty in Cd/P concentration ratio of commercial fertilizers. In addition, element balances were sensitive to empirical assumptions on fertilization strategy of farmers, such as the partitioning of manure between <b>balance</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R
