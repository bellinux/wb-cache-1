5|$|Like biochemistry, the {{overlapping}} disciplines of bacteriology and virology (later combined as microbiology), situated {{between science and}} medicine, developed rapidly in the early 20th century.

5|$|The use of {{antimicrobial}} peptides against P. acnes {{is under}} investigation {{as a treatment for}} acne to overcoming antibiotic resistance. In 2007, the first genome sequencing of a P. acnes <b>bacteriophage</b> (PA6) was reported. The authors proposed applying this research toward development of <b>bacteriophage</b> therapy as an acne treatment in order to overcome the problems associated with long-term antibiotic therapy such as bacterial resistance. Oral and topical probiotics are also being evaluated as treatments for acne. Probiotics have been hypothesized to have therapeutic effects for those affected by acne due to their ability to decrease skin inflammation and improve skin moisture by increasing the skin's ceramide content. As of 2014, studies examining the effects of probiotics on acne in humans were limited.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{and related}} {{bacteria}} possess {{the ability to}} transfer DNA via bacterial conjugation or transduction, which allows genetic material to spread horizontally through an existing population.

40|$|Most {{approaches}} to combat antibiotic resistant bacteria concentrate on discovering new antibiotics or modifying existing ones. However, {{one of the}} most promising alternatives is the use of <b>bacteriophages.</b> This study was focused on the isolation of <b>bacteriophages</b> that are specific to some of commonly human pathogens namely E. coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae. These <b>bacteriophages</b> were isolated from sewages that were collected from four different locations in Kirkuk City. Apart from S. pyogenes, <b>bacteriophages</b> specific to all tested bacteria were successfully isolated and tested for their effectiveness by spot test.

However, the practical application of this finding is limited because some specific host strains were restricted to certain geographic regions. In this study, novel Bacteroides host strains were isolated that discriminate human and animal faecal pollution in Switzerland. Two strains specific for <b>bacteriophages</b> present in human faecal contamination and three strains specific for <b>bacteriophages</b> indicating animal faecal contamination were evaluated. <b>Bacteriophages</b> infecting human strains were exclusively found in human wastewater, whereas animal strains detected <b>bacteriophages</b> only in animal waste. The newly isolated host strains {{could be used to}} determine the source of surface and spring water faecal contamination in field situations.

5|$|He {{was awarded}} the Beit Memorial Fellowship by the Lister Institute in 1926; this gave him enough money for him to resign his curator {{position}} and he began full-time research on bacteriophages. He injected mice with <b>bacteriophage</b> and observed their immunological reactions and believed bacteriophages to be viruses. For this work he received a Ph.D. from the University of London in 1928 {{under the direction of}} Professor J. D. Ledingham and was invited to write a chapter on bacteriophages for the Medical Research Council's System of Bacteriology. He was also given an invitation to deliver a paper at the Royal Society of Medicine in 1927 on the link between O-agglutinins and <b>bacteriophage.</b> Burnet began attending the Fabian Society functions and befriended some communists, although he refrained from joining them in overt left-wing activism. He also spent his free time enjoying theatre, engaging in amateur archaeology and cycling through continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Walter Fiers and {{his team}} at the University of Ghent {{were the first to}} {{determine}} the sequence of a gene: the gene for <b>Bacteriophage</b> MS2 coat protein.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s the {{prevailing}} {{view was that}} the genes in a chromosome acted like discrete entities, indivisible by recombination and arranged like beads on a string. The experiments of Benzer using mutants defective in the rII region of <b>bacteriophage</b> T4 (1955-1959) showed that individual genes have a simple linear structure {{and are likely to}} be equivalent to a linear section of DNA.|$|E
50|$|In 2016 the {{biologists}} Sarah R. Bordestein and Seth R. Bordestein {{reported that}} genes are frequently transferred between hosts and parasites. Eukaryotic genes are often co-opted by viruses and bacterial genes are {{commonly found in}} <b>bacteriophages.</b> The presence of <b>bacteriophages</b> in symbiotic bacteria that obligately reside in eukaryotes may promote eukayotic DNA transfers to <b>bacteriophages.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{temperate}} <b>bacteriophages</b> of Bacillus subtilis differ {{dramatically in}} {{their response to}} the induction of the SOS system during the development of competence and following DNA damage. While all temperate <b>bacteriophages</b> are induced following DNA damage, the "naive" <b>bacteriophages</b> (i. e., phi 105 and SPO 2) are also induced during the development of competence.

5|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of a gene's DNA specifies the {{amino acid sequence}} of a protein through the genetic code. Sets of three nucleotides, known as codons, each correspond to a specific amino acid. The principle that three sequential bases of DNA code for each amino acid was demonstrated in 1961 using frameshift mutations in the rIIB gene of <b>bacteriophage</b> T4 (see Crick, Brenner et al. experiment).|$|E
5|$|Transduction of {{bacterial}} genes by <b>bacteriophage</b> {{is a consequence}} of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles. Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system, is determined by plasmid genes that encode the machinery necessary to transfer a new copy of the plasmid DNA from one bacterial host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium.|$|E
5|$|Uracil is {{not usually}} found in DNA, {{occurring}} only as a breakdown product of cytosine. However, in several bacteriophages, Bacillus subtilis bacteriophages PBS1 and PBS2 and Yersinia <b>bacteriophage</b> piR1-37, thymine {{has been replaced by}} uracil.

40|$|International audienceUropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is {{the leading}} cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs) worldwide, causing over 150 million {{clinical}} cases annually. There is currently no specific treatment addressing the asymptomatic carriage in the gut of UPEC before they initiate UTIs. This study investigates the efficacy of virulent <b>bacteriophages</b> to decrease carriage of gut pathogens. Three virulent <b>bacteriophages</b> infecting an antibiotic-resistant UPEC strain were isolated and characterized both in vitro and in vivo. A new experimental murine model of gut carriage of E. coli was elaborated and the impact of virulent <b>bacteriophages</b> on colonization levels and microbiota diversity was assessed. A single dose of a cocktail of the three <b>bacteriophages</b> led to a sharp decrease in E. coli levels throughout the gut. We also observed that microbiota diversity was much less affected by <b>bacteriophages</b> than by antibiotics. Therefore, virulent <b>bacteriophages</b> can efficiently target UPEC strains residing in the gut, with potentially profound public health and economic impacts. These results open a new area with the possibility to manipulate specifically the microbiota using virulent <b>bacteriophages,</b> which could have broad applications in many gut-related disorders/diseases and beyond...|$|R
5|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} {{are used}} to identify infectious diseases such as chlamydia, influenza virus and tuberculosis; or specific strains such as H1N1 virus. Genetic identification can be swift; for example a loop-mediated isothermal amplification test diagnoses the malaria parasite and is rugged enough for developing countries. But despite these advances in genome analysis, in 2013 infections are still more often identified by other meanstheir proteome, <b>bacteriophage,</b> or chromatographic profile. Molecular diagnostics are also used to understand the specific strain of the pathogenfor example by detecting which drug resistance genes it possessesand hence which therapies to avoid.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of standard, genetically uniform organisms that could produce repeatable experimental results was {{essential for the}} {{development of}} molecular genetics. After early work with Drosophila and maize, the adoption of simpler model systems like the bread mold Neurospora crassa made it possible to connect genetics to biochemistry, most importantly with Beadle and Tatum's one gene-one enzyme hypothesis in 1941. Genetics experiments on even simpler systems like tobacco mosaic virus and <b>bacteriophage,</b> aided by the new technologies of electron microscopy and ultracentrifugation, forced scientists to re-evaluate the literal meaning of life; virus heredity and reproducing nucleoprotein cell structures outside the nucleus ("plasmagenes") complicated the accepted Mendelian-chromosome theory.|$|E
5|$|The first {{complete}} DNA {{sequence of}} an E. coli genome (laboratory strain K-12 derivative MG1655) {{was published in}} 1997.

Despite having been the subject of intensive genetic analysis for about 40 years, a large number of these genes were previously unknown. The coding density was found to be very high, with a mean distance between genes of only 118 base pairs. The genome was observed to contain a significant number of transposable genetic elements, repeat elements, cryptic prophages, and <b>bacteriophage</b> remnants.|$|E
5|$|The major way {{bacteria}} {{defend themselves}} from <b>bacteriophages</b> is by producing enzymes which destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, cut up the viral DNA that <b>bacteriophages</b> inject into bacterial cells.|$|R
40|$|The {{review of}} the modern data about <b>bacteriophages</b> and to their {{application}} to surgery is presented.

5|$|Modified bases {{also occur}} in DNA. The {{first of these}} {{recognised}} was 5-methylcytosine which {{was found in the}} genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 1925. The complete replacement of cytosine by 5-glycosylhydroxymethylcytosine in T even phages (T2, T4 and T6) was observed in 1953 In the genomes of Xanthomonas oryzae <b>bacteriophage</b> Xp12 and halovirus FH the full complement of cystosine has been replaced by 5-methylcytosine. 6N-methyadenine was discovered to be present in DNA in 1955. N6-carbamoyl-methyladenine was described in 1975. 7-methylguanine was described in 1976. N4-methylcytosine in DNA was described in 1983. In 1985 5-hydroxycytosine was found in the genomes of the Rhizobium phages RL38JI and N17. α-putrescinylthymine occurs in both the genomes of the Delftia phage ΦW-14 and the Bacillus phage SP10. α-glutamythymidine is found in the Bacillus phage SP01 and 5-dihydroxypentyluracil is found in the Bacillus phage SP15.|$|E
5|$|Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, {{and thereby}} avoid {{detection}} and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved {{to recognize and}} neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system {{in the form of}} enzymes that protect against <b>bacteriophage</b> infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.|$|E
5|$|The first temperature-sensitive RNA element was {{reported}} in 1989. Prior to this research, mutations upstream from the transcription start site in a lambda (λ) phage cIII mRNA were found to affect the level of translation of the cIII protein. This protein is involved in selection of either a lytic or lysogenic life cycle in λ phage, with high concentrations of cIII promoting lysogeny. Further study of this upstream RNA region identified two alternative secondary structures; experimental study found the structures to be interchangeable, and dependent on both magnesium ion concentration and temperature. This RNA thermometer is now thought to encourage entry to a lytic cycle under heat stress {{in order for the}} <b>bacteriophage</b> to rapidly replicate and escape the host cell.|$|E

40|$|Enrichment {{cultures}} {{are widely used}} for the isolation of bacteria in clinical, biotechnological, and environmental studies. However, competition, relative growth rates, or inhibitory effects may alter the outcome of enrichment cultures, causing the phenomenon known as enrichment bias. <b>Bacteriophages</b> are a major component in many microbial systems, and it abounds in natural settings. This abundance means that <b>bacteriophages</b> {{are likely to be}} present in many laboratory enrichment cultures. Our hypothesis was that <b>bacteriophages</b> present in the sample might bias the enriched subpopulation, since it can infect and lyse the target bacteria during the enrichment step once the bacteria reach a given density. Here we show that the presence of <b>bacteriophages</b> in Salmonella and Shigella enrichment cultures produced a significant reduction (more than 1 log unit) in the number of these bacteria compared with samples in which <b>bacteriophages</b> had been reduced by filtration through 0. 45 -μm non-protein-binding membranes. Furthermore, our data indicate that the Salmonella biotypes isolated after the enrichment culture change if <b>bacteriophages</b> are present, thus distorting the results of the analysis...|$|R
50|$|<b>Bacteriophages</b> {{are among}} the best studied organisms in the natural world. This is because their {{molecular}} biology is relatively simple. Many molecular principles were first studied in <b>bacteriophages</b> prior to being found in higher organisms. <b>Bacteriophages</b> are ubiquitous. High numbers can be found in seawater and also in fermented foods such as yogurt or cheese. <b>Bacteriophages</b> are extremely specific in the bacteria they recognize. The recognition is often limited to specific strains of one species, in rare cases several strains of the same species or genus are recognized. With this fact in mind their potential in fighting unwanted bacteria has recently received increased attention.|$|R
