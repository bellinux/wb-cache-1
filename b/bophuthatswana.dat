50|$|<b>Bophuthatswana's</b> {{independence}} was not recognized by any government {{other than those}} of South Africa and Transkei, the first homeland to gain nominal independence. In addition, it was later internally recognized by the two additional countries within the TBVC-system, Ciskei and Venda.|$|R
25|$|Stewart was criticised for {{breaking}} the widely observed cultural boycott of apartheid South Africa by performing at the Sun City resort complex in <b>Bophuthatswana</b> {{as part of his}} Body Wishes (1983) and Camouflage (1984) tours.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} South African {{order of}} wear was revised in 1994 {{to include the}} military decorations and medals of the defence forces of the Republics of Transkei, <b>Bophuthatswana,</b> Venda and Ciskei which were integrated with the South African Defence Force (SADF) into the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) on 27 April 1994.|$|E
25|$|Afrikaans is also widely {{spoken in}} Namibia. Before independence, Afrikaans had equal status with German as an {{official}} language. Since independence in 1990, Afrikaans has had constitutional recognition as a national, but not official, language. There is a much smaller number of Afrikaans speakers among Zimbabwe's white minority, as most have left the country since 1980. Afrikaans was also a medium of instruction for schools in <b>Bophuthatswana,</b> an Apartheid-era Bantustan.|$|E

5000|$|The {{homeland}} {{was set up}} {{to house}} Setswana-speaking peoples. In 1983, it had more than 1,430,000 inhabitants; in 1990, it had an estimated population of 2,352,296. [...] Only 10% of <b>Bophuthatswana's</b> total land area was arable, and much of that was covered with scrub brush.|$|R

25|$|The {{declaration}} was {{the first}} of such agreements by acknowledged black and white leaders in South Africa that affirmed to these principles. The commitment to the peaceful pursuit of political change was declared at a time when neither the National Party or African National Congress were looking for peaceful solutions or dialogue. The declaration was heralded by the English speaking press as a breakthrough in race relations in South Africa. The declaration was endorsed by several chief ministers of the black homelands, including Cedric Phatudi (Lebowa), Lucas Mangope (<b>Bophuthatswana)</b> and Hudson Nisanwisi (Gazankulu). The declaration also received praise from liberal figures such as Alan Paton.|$|E
25|$|That year, Queen began The Works Tour, {{the first}} tour to feature keyboardist Spike Edney {{as an extra}} live musician. The tour {{featured}} nine sold-out dates in October in <b>Bophuthatswana,</b> South Africa, at the arena in Sun City. Upon returning to England, they were the subject of outrage, having played in South Africa {{during the height of}} apartheid and in violation of worldwide divestment efforts and a United Nations cultural boycott. The band responded to the critics by stating that they were playing music for fans in South Africa, and they also stressed that the concerts were played before integrated audiences. Queen donated to a school for the deaf and blind as a philanthropic gesture but were fined by the British Musicians' Union and placed on the United Nations' blacklisted artists.|$|E
500|$|In 1980, Sinatra's {{first album}} {{in six years}} was released, , a highly ambitious triple album that {{features}} an array of songs from both the pre-rock era and rock era. It was the first studio album of Sinatra's to feature his touring pianist at the time, Vinnie Falcone, and {{was based on an}} idea by Sonny Burke. The album garnered six Grammy nominations– winning for best liner notes– and peaked at number 17 on Billboards album chart, and spawned yet another song that would become a signature tune, [...] "Theme from New York, New York". That year, as part of the Concert of the Americas, he performed in the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which broke records for the [...] "largest live paid audience ever recorded for a solo performer". The following year, Sinatra built on the success of Trilogy with She Shot Me Down, an album that was praised for embodying the dark tone of his Capitol years. Also in 1981, Sinatra was embroiled in controversy when he worked a ten-day engagement for $2million in Sun City, in the internationally unrecognized <b>Bophuthatswana,</b> breaking a cultural boycott against apartheid-era South Africa. President Lucas Mangope awarded Sinatra with the highest honor, the Order of the Leopard, and made him an honorary tribal chief.|$|E
5000|$|Like the Lowe, the Nkwe {{was struck}} {{to commemorate the}} 10th anniversary of <b>Bophuthatswana's</b> independence. The Nkwe has {{the head of a}} leopard {{depicted}} on the obverse. The Nkwe, which was issued in proof only, is of [...]917 (or 22 carat) fine gold. It weighs 16.9660 grammes (or 1/2 ounce).|$|R
50|$|Following more {{protests and}} {{increasing}} rumors of ANC supporters massing on <b>Bophuthatswana's</b> established borders, Mangope asked Viljoen and the Volksfront to immediately assist {{in keeping the}} peace. The Afrikaners were hastily rallied and mobilised, {{under the command of}} retired South African Defence Force Colonel Jan Breytenbach. Led by one of Breytenbach's lieutenants, Commandant Douw Steyn, a large Volksfront force mustered at the Mmabatho Air Force Base early on 11 March.|$|R
50|$|The Distinguished Service Medal, Silver is, in effect, Venda's {{equivalent}} of the South African Southern Cross Medal (1975) and Pro Merito Medal (1975). It would appear, therefore, as though {{the position of the}} Distinguished Service Medal, Silver, instituted in 1985, in the official order of precedence was allocated in error. According to their dates of institution, it should have taken precedence after the Pro Merito Medal (1975) and not after the Pro Merito Medal (1967). Its correct position in the order of wear would therefore be after <b>Bophuthatswana's</b> Defence Force Merit Medal of 1982 and before Ciskei's Sandile Medal of 1988.|$|R
500|$|Concerned that COSAG would {{undermine}} the election, particularly {{in the wake of}} the conflict in <b>Bophuthatswana</b> and the Shell House Massacre—incidents of violence involving the AWB and Inkatha, respectively—Mandela met with Afrikaner politicians and generals, including P. W. Botha, Pik Botha and Constand Viljoen, persuading many to work within the democratic system. With de Klerk, he also convinced Inkatha's Buthelezi to enter the elections rather than launch a war of secession. As leaders of the two major parties, de Klerk and Mandela appeared on a televised debate; although de Klerk was widely considered the better speaker at the event, Mandela's offer to shake his hand surprised him, leading some commentators to deem it a victory for Mandela. The election went ahead with little violence, although an AWB cell killed 20 with car bombs. As widely expected, the ANC won a sweeping victory, taking 63% of the vote, just short of the two-thirds majority needed to unilaterally change the constitution. The ANC was also victorious in seven provinces, with Inkatha and the National Party each taking another. [...] Mandela voted at the Ohlange High School in Durban, and though the ANC's victory assured his election as President, he publicly accepted that the election had been marred by instances of fraud and sabotage.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Greenwald had {{a variety}} of unusual ties to South Africa in the Apartheid era. He was the {{diplomatic}} representative of the African Bantustan of <b>Bophuthatswana</b> in the United States, when that [...] "homeland" [...] lacked international recognition.|$|E
2500|$|The South African Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging or AWB (meaning Afrikaner Resistance Movement), {{a militant}} neo-Nazi, mainly Afrikaner white {{supremacist}} movement that {{arose in the}} 1970s, and was active until the mid-1990s, openly used a flag that closely resembled the swastika. In the early to mid-1990s, the AWB attempted unsuccessfully through various acts of public violence and intimidation to derail the country's transition to democracy. After the country's first multiracial democratic elections in 1994, a number of terrorist bomb blasts were linked to the AWB. On 11 March 1994, several hundred AWB members formed part of an armed right-wing force that invaded the nominally independent [...] "homeland" [...] territory of <b>Bophuthatswana,</b> in a failed attempt to prop up its unpopular, conservative leader Chief Lucas Mangope. The AWB leader Eugène Terre'Blanche was murdered by farm workers on 3 April 2010.|$|E
5000|$|... "Physical" [...] also {{gathered}} controversies in South Africa. In 1982, Newton-John {{performed at}} the <b>Bophuthatswana's</b> Sun City Super Bowl and the special appearance was recorded by South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). When Olivia was performing the single, the transmission was withdrawn without explanation, but later was reinstated, omitting the verses [...] "There's nothing left to talk about" [...] / [...] "Unless it horizontally". According to Billboard, the [...] "committee of moral" [...] of South Africa under apartheid had always employed a policy of restricting airplay on certain material considered [...] "offensive". About all the controversies over the song and its music video, Newton-John stated: ...|$|R
5000|$|However, the homelands {{were only}} kept afloat by massive {{subsidies}} from the South African government; for instance, by 1985 in Transkei, 85% of the homeland's income came from direct transfer payments from Pretoria. The Bantustans' governments were invariably corrupt and little wealth trickled {{down to the}} local populations, who were forced to seek employment as [...] "guest workers" [...] in South Africa proper. Millions of people had to work in often appalling conditions, away from their homes {{for months at a}} time. On the other hand, 40% of <b>Bophuthatswana's</b> population worked outside the 'homeland' because the homeland was able to create industrial site like Zone 15 and Babelegi.|$|R
50|$|Under Terre'Blanche, the AWB {{swore to}} use {{violence}} to preserve minority rule, opposing any concessions {{offered to the}} African National Congress - an organisation AWB supporters repeatedly branded as Marxist terrorists - and gaining notoriety for storming the Kempton Park Trade Centre during bilateral negotiations in 1993. AWB loyalists also clashed with South African security forces at the Battle of Ventersdorp, a bloody 1991 skirmish in which police opened fire on a white crowd {{for the first time}} since the Rand Rebellion, leaving three Afrikaners dead. Immediately prior to South Africa's first multiracial elections, Terre'Blanche's followers were linked to a number of bombings and assassinations targeting the South African Communist Party; armed AWB commandos even participated in <b>Bophuthatswana's</b> abortive 1994 coup d'état.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Bophuthatswana</b> Defence Force (BDF) was {{established}} upon that country's independence on 6 December 1977. The Republic of <b>Bophuthatswana</b> {{ceased to exist}} on 27 April 1994 and the <b>Bophuthatswana</b> Defence Force was amalgamated with six other military forces into the South African National Defence Force (SANDF).|$|E
50|$|Following <b>Bophuthatswana's</b> {{independence}} from South Africa in 1977, then-president Lucas Mangope decided to re-introduce wildlife and convert the Pilanesberg {{into a game}} reserve. A planning committee was established to develop the game reserve, which was to include {{the whole of the}} Pilanesberg mountains. However, to facilitate this new designation, people residing in the area had to be re-settled. Following that, all buildings in the area, including the mission church on Driefontein but excluding the magistrate court building, were demolished. (The magistrate court building, a lovely Cape Dutch style structure, burned down in an accidental blaze in the 1980s. It was subsequently partially rebuilt. A new building, the Pilanesberg Centre, was also erected near where the court used to stand.) Additionally, all non-native flora were razed from the region in an attempt to ensure only authentic native plant life would exist in the park.|$|R
50|$|With {{the arrival}} of so many new aircraft, the <b>Bophuthatswana</b> Air Wing took the name <b>Bophuthatswana</b> Air Force in late 1987.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bophuthatswana</b> began issuing its own Postal Orders {{shortly after}} gaining {{independence}} from South Africa in 1977. As <b>Bophuthatswana</b> {{did not have}} its own banknotes (because its currency was the Rand), postal orders are the closest things to banknotes <b>Bophuthatswana</b> ever had. The last day of issue was 26 April 1994.|$|E
50|$|Parliamentary {{elections}} {{were held in}} <b>Bophuthatswana</b> in October 1982. The <b>Bophuthatswana</b> Democratic Party won all 72 of the elected seats in the National Assembly.|$|E

Its seat of government was Mmabatho.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bophuthatswana</b> Air Force (BAF) was the {{aviation}} {{branch of the}} <b>Bophuthatswana</b> Defence Force. The BAF existed from 1987 until 27 April 1994. The primary role of the BAF was to provide support and medevac services to the ground units of the <b>Bophuthatswana</b> army. The BAF operated from several bases, one being Mmabatho AFB.|$|E
50|$|In November 1977 a High Court was {{established}} at Mmabatho (now {{a suburb of}} Mahikeng) {{to take over the}} jurisdiction of the provincial divisions of the Supreme Court of South Africa in the bantustan of <b>Bophuthatswana.</b> A month later <b>Bophuthatswana</b> achieved nominal independence from South Africa and the High Court became the Supreme Court of <b>Bophuthatswana.</b> At first its decisions could be appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa, but in 1982 a separate Appellate Division {{was established}} within the <b>Bophuthatswana</b> court.|$|E
