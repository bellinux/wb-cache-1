2500|$|The {{rectified}} current from the detector has radio frequency pulses from the carrier frequency in it, which are {{blocked by the}} high inductive reactance and do not pass well through the coils of early date earphones. Hence, a small capacitor called a <b>bypass</b> <b>capacitor</b> is often placed across the earphone terminals; its low reactance at radio frequency bypasses these pulses around the earphone to ground.

2500|$|Modern crystal sets use {{piezoelectric}} crystal earpieces, {{which are}} much more sensitive and also smaller. They consist of a piezoelectric crystal with electrodes attached to each side, glued to a light diaphragm. When the audio signal from the radio set {{is applied to the}} electrodes, it causes the crystal to vibrate, vibrating the diaphragm. Crystal earphones are designed as ear buds that plug directly into the ear canal of the wearer, coupling the sound more efficiently to the eardrum. Their resistance is much higher (typically megohms) so they do not greatly [...] "load" [...] the tuned circuit, allowing increased selectivity of the receiver. The piezoelectric earphone's higher resistance, in parallel with its capacitance of around 9 pF, creates a [...] filter that allows the passage of low frequencies, but blocks the higher frequencies. In that case a <b>bypass</b> <b>capacitor</b> is not needed (although in practice a small one of around 0.68 to 1 nF is often used to help improve quality), but instead a 10-100 kΩ resistor must be added in parallel with the earphone's input.|$|E

50|$|The easiest type of {{demodulation}} {{to understand}} is AM demodulation, used in AM radios to recover the audio modulation signal, which represents sound and is converted to sound waves by the radio's speaker.

50|$|A {{decoupling}} capacitor is a capacitor used to decouple {{one part of}} an electrical network (circuit) from another.

50|$|Plate {{detectors}} {{are used}} in both T.R.F. and (less commonly) superheterodyne receivers. The grid is connected directly to the secondary of the final R.F. or I.F. transformer. The cathode is connected to ground through a circuit consisting of a parallel-connected bias resistor (usually 10 kΩ to 50 kΩ) and <b>bypass</b> <b>capacitor</b> (usually 0.25 µF to 0.5 µF). When sufficient negative bias {{is applied to the}} grid, the plate current is pushed almost to the cut-off point. When a modulated R.F. signal is applied to the grid under these conditions, a corresponding increase in plate current occurs. As the signal amplitude varies, the plate current also varies, causing the plate to act as a diode detector while the tube as a whole also acts as an audio amplifier. A plate <b>bypass</b> <b>capacitor</b> (usually 500 pF to 0.002 µF for triodes, or 250 pF to 0.001 µF for tetrodes and pentodes) is used to regulate plate current.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2002 This {{research}} work carries out {{the analysis of}} microstrip with gap discontinuity and <b>bypass</b> <b>capacitors</b> on the ground plane. The full wave approach is based on integral equations using the spatial domain Green's function in layered medium. Method of moment solution is obtained with RWG basis function and Galerkin testing. The method is applied to gaps with <b>bypass</b> <b>capacitors</b> in single and double layer structure. Simulation results were obtained for various values and locations of <b>bypass</b> <b>capacitors</b> and for {{the case of a}} second reference plane. This {{research work}} presents a full wave modeling technique for vertical vias in multi-layered integrated circuits. The analysis of the interior problem is based upon the cylindrical wave expansion of the magnetic field Green's function; the multiple interaction among vias is modeled by the Foldy-Lax scattering formula. Multi-layered effects are considered using cascaded network of the single-layered components. The exterior problem is analyzed using MOM approach and combined with interior problem into a system of equation to facilitate solution of large number of vias. Problems of several thousand vias are analyzed with moderate CPU and memory requirement. Numerical results are obtained for different via configurations and for large range of frequency. Also illustrated are results for differential signaling with surrounding idle and shorting vias...|$|R

50|$|In the transitron circuit, {{the screen}} and {{suppressor}} grids are coupled with a <b>bypass</b> <b>capacitor</b> (C2) which has a low impedance at the oscillation frequency, {{so they have a}} constant potential difference. The parallel tuned circuit (C1-L) is connected between the screen grid and the cathode (through battery B1). The negative resistance of the screen grid cancels the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, causing oscillations. As in the dynatron oscillator the control grid can be used to adjust the negative resistance.|$|E
