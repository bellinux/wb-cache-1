40|$|Background: Salivary gland pathologies {{represent}} a histologically {{diverse group of}} benign and malignant neoplasms. Currently, World Health Organization recognizes 13 benign and 24 malignant variants of all salivary gland neoplasms. Surgery continues to remain the main-stay for treatment of parotid gland neoplasms. The {{aim of this study}} was to document our experiences of the patients treated for parotid tumors and find out if any compelling variable predicted the relative clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study, from records of parotidectomies performed at the operating theatre by the head and neck cancer division of the study institution between 2010 and 2013. Eligibility for study inclusion included cases with benign or malignant parotid neoplasms requiring surgical management with or without adjunct radiotherapy. The predictors of postoperative complications, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed. Results: A total of 20 patients underwent parotidectomy. The mean age was 42 years. Tumors were located on the left parotid in 13 cases (65 %) and the right parotid in 7 cases (35 %). The surgical procedures comprised 16 superficial parotidectomies, 1 total parotidectomy, and 3 radical parotidectomy (inclusive of facial nerve sacrifice) and 2 neck dissections levels II–V. The reconstructive procedures were 2 facial nerve <b>branch</b> <b>cable</b> grafts, 1 end-to-end facial-facial nerve branch anastomoses, and 2 facial re-animation surgeries (temporalis muscle suspensions). A total of five cases (33. 3 %) had postoperative complications. 2 variables (length of surgery and neck dissection) were found to have an impact on postoperative complications that were statistically significant. Additionally, length of surgery was a significant predictor on the 2 years OS and DFS. Conclusion: The result of this study showed good clinical outcome, especially in the benign cases. The comprehensive clinical outcome of the malignant cases could not be objectively assessed, as the OS and DFS were 50 % at 2 -years follow-up. It is our submission that a larger sample size is utilized in subsequent studies and quality of life evaluation is included in the methodology...|$|E

Single exponentials can be fitted reasonably well to the decay phase of clamped synaptic currents, although they contain many underlying components. The effective time constant depends on the fit interval. The smoothing effects on synaptic clamp currents of dendritic cables and series resistance are explored with a single cylinder + soma model, for inputs with different time courses. "Soma" and "cable" charging currents cannot be separated easily when the soma is {{much smaller than the}} dendrites. Subtractive soma capacitance compensation and series resistance compensation are discussed. In a hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal neurone model, voltage control at most dendritic sites is extremely poor. Parameter dependencies are illustrated. The effects of series resistance compound those of dendritic cables and depend on the "effective capacitance" of the cell. Plausible combinations of parameters can cause order-of-magnitude distortions to clamp current waveform measures of simulated Schaeffer collateral inputs. These voltage clamp problems are unlikely to be solved by the use of switch clamp methods...|$|R

However, recently Multicarrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) which combines the best features of OFDM and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) has been gaining popularity. In this work, a typical low-voltage power-line network found in Kariakoo Area, Dar es Salaam has been considered. Performance of such a low-voltage channel using Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access with Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation has been assessed for suitability to communication.

40|$|Human blood platelets, {{which are}} highly motile cells {{essential}} {{for the maintenance of}} hemostasis, contain large quantities of actin and other contractile proteins. We have previously introduced a method (Lucas, R. C., T. C. Detwiler, and A. Stracher, J. Cell Biol., 1976, 70 (2, Pt. 2) : 259 a) for the quantitative recovery of the platelets' cytoskeleton using a solution containing 1 % Triton X- 100 and 10 mM EGTA. This cytoskeleton contains most of the platelets' actin, actin-binding protein (ABP, subunit molecular weight = 260, 000), and a 105, 000 -dalton protein. Negative staining of this Triton-insoluble residue on an EM grid shows it to consist of <b>branched</b> <b>cables</b> of actin filaments aligned in parallel. When this cytoskeletal structure is dissolved in high-salt solutions, the actin and ABP dissociate and can subsequently be separated. Here we will present simple and rapid methods for the individual purifications of platelet actin and platelet ABP. When purified actin and ABP are recombined in vitro, they are shown to be both necessary and sufficient for the reformation of the cytoskeletal complex. The reformed structure is visualized as a complex array of fibers, which at the EM level are seen to be bundles of actin filaments. The reformation of the cytoskeleton requires only that the actin be in the filamentous form [...] no accessory proteins, chelating agents, divalent cations, or energy sources are necessary. In vivo, however, the state of assembly of the platelets' cytoskeleton appears to be {{under the control of the}} intracellular concentration of free calcium. Under conditions where proteolysis is inhibited and EGTA is omitted from the Triton-solubilization step, no cytoskeleton can be isolated. The ability of Ca+ 2 to control the assembly and disassembly of the platelets' cytoskeleton provides a mechanism for cytoskeletal involvement in shape change and pseudopod formation during platelet activation...|$|R

By comparing the deviations between model and experimental responses to control noise recordings, approximate 95 % confidence intervals were established for each parameter.

With zero shunt, Cm was 0. 7 - 0. 8 microFcm- 2, Ri was 170 - 340 omega cm, and Rm ranged between 120 and 200 k omega cm 2. The electrotonic lengths of the basal and oblique dendrites were 0. 2 - 0. 3 space constants, and those of the apical tufts were 0. 4 - 0. 7 space constants. The steady-state electrical geometry of these cells was therefore compact; average dendritic tip/soma relative synaptic efficacies were > 93 % for the basal and oblique dendrites, and > 81 % for the tufts.

The analysis permits determination of cable loss savings for various choices of cable sizes. The method is extended to include cost of cable and expected future costs of energy so that an economical choice of cable size may be determined. An example is presented to illustrate the method.
