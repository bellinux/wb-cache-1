Let Create_n0 denote a Turing machine creating n0 1s on an initially <b>blank</b> <b>tape.</b> This machine may be constructed in a trivial manner to have n0 states (the state i writes 1, moves the head right and switches to state i + 1, except the state n0, which halts). Let N denote the sum n0 + n0.|$|E

25|$|Let BadS {{denote the}} {{composition}} Create_n0 | Double | EvalS | Clean. Notice that this machine has N states. Starting with an initially <b>blank</b> <b>tape</b> it first creates {{a sequence of}} n0 1s and then doubles it, producing a sequence of N 1s. Then BadS will produce S(N) 1s on tape, and at last it will clear all 1s and then halt. But the phase of cleaning will continue at least S(N) steps, so the time of working of BadS is strictly greater than S(N), which contradicts {{to the definition of}} the function S(n).|$|E

2500|$|A {{variant of}} Kolmogorov {{complexity}} {{is defined as}} follows : [...] The complexity of a number n is the smallest number of states needed for a BB-class Turing machine that halts with a single block of n consecutive 1s on an initially <b>blank</b> <b>tape.</b> [...] The corresponding variant of Chaitin's incompleteness theorem states that, {{in the context of a}} given axiomatic system for the natural numbers, there exists a number k such that no specific number can be proved to have complexity greater than k, and hence that no specific upper bound can be proven for Σ(k) (the latter is because [...] "the complexity of n is greater than k" [...] would be proved if [...] "n > Σ(k)" [...] were proved). As mentioned in the cited reference, for any axiomatic system of [...] "ordinary mathematics" [...] the least value k for which this is true is far less than 10↑↑10; consequently, in the context of ordinary mathematics, neither the value nor any upper-bound of Σ(10 ↑↑ 10) can be proven. (Gödel's first incompleteness theorem is illustrated by this result: in an axiomatic system of ordinary mathematics, there is a true-but-unprovable sentence of the form [...] "Σ(10 ↑↑ 10) = n", and there are infinitely many true-but-unprovable sentences of the form [...] "Σ(10 ↑↑ 10) < n".) ...|$|E
