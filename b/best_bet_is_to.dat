As a result, in cultures that are deeply suspicious of institutional structures and that place a high value on individual freedom and autonomy, spirituality has come to have largely positive connotations, while religion has been viewed more negatively.

50|$|Santiago Imán was a Creole revolutionary {{involved}} {{in a series of}} events that led to, and help cause, the Caste War of Yucatán and was born in 1800. Through 1839 to 1840, starting on May 29, he led a revolt which helped push the Yucatán's separation from Mexico, which was currently going through tough problems after the Pastry War with France and was also having difficulty, and weakness, regaining territory lost to the U.S, including Texas. He encouraged Federalism in the Yucatán once Mexican independence came and Spanish rule was eliminated. He was higher up in the caste like system at the time as a merchant Creole who owned land in the city of Tizimin. The Centralized Mexican government at the time was becoming more frustrated, in need of men to reconquer Texas from the United States, and sought to gather soldiers by being more oppressive to this deed. Imán knew that his <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> gather the Mayan peoples that resided in the Yucatán to aide in forming Yucatán as an independent nation. He gained their devotion by promising the abolition of Church taxes, which the Mayan people for obvious religious reasons didn't appreciate, and with his ambition and the motivation on the heads of the Mayan peasantry they momentarily drove Independence for the Yucatán till 1843; later Independence periods where brought in a few following years up until 1848 where they were quenched once and for all. His drive brought many social changes including the disuse of public lands, and new forms of awarding individuals for many forms of service mostly including military work. His actions would later drive and motivate more Creole revolutions notably the Caste War of Yucatán in 1847.|$|R

After wrestling on {{the lower end of}} the card to get the fans familiar with the team the Midnight Rockers soon moved onto a feud with the team of Doug Somers and Buddy Rose who at the time were one of the top teams in the promotion. Their initial outing with Somers and Rose at the WrestleRock stadium show on April 20, 1986 did not go well for Jannetty and Michaels who lost in front of 22,000 fans. When Somers and Rose beat Scott Hall and Curt Hennig for the AWA World Tag Team Championship the Midnight Rockers suddenly found themselves chasing the main tag team title of the promotion. The Midnight Rockers teamed up with Curt Hennig to defeat Somer, Rose and Alexis Smirnoff at ”Battle by the Bay” on June 28, 1986 to prove that they were indeed capable of beating the champions. The Midnight Rockers would repeatedly challenge Somers throughout the rest of 1986 but never quite <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> get the win when the title was on the line.

A month later on January 27 1987 the Midnight Rockers defeated Rose and Somers for the AWA Tag Team title. Jannetty and Michaels realized that the AWA was a promotion in decline, in fact it would shut down completely by 1990, and they decided that their <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> work for the WWF.

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} a novel {{challenge}} to consequentialism as a theory in normative ethics. The challenge {{is rooted in}} the ontological claim that consequences of actions do not exist at the time required to be that in virtue of which actions are right or wrong, and so consequences cannot play the role attributed to them by consequentialists. The challenge {{takes the form of a}} dilemma. The consequentialist is confronted with a set of propositions she will find individually plausible but incompossible if taken in conjunction with consequentialism. The task is to restore consistency. There are ways of maintaining the view that consequences are right-makers, but they come at the cost of endorsing highly implausible and unattractive theses. Versions of what might be called quasi-consequentialism can be rendered metaphysically coherent, but these are consequentialisms in name only, and they are best seen as components of an account of practical rationality that has strong echoes of traditional natural law theory. Since this is unlikely to appeal to contemporary consequentialists, their <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> reject consequentialism altogether...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis <b>is</b> <b>to</b> provide {{confidence}} for the designer that a concept of a future space-based telescope will meet its very stringent requirements. More specifically, our goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> predict the amount of uncertainty in the performance prediction made through out the design process. Also, given a statistical database for structural uncertainty, the methodology presented will establish the probability of success of a particular architecture. The traditional design process starts by evaluating and comparing the performance of different concepts by using simplified structural and disturbance models. As the process progresses the different solutions are evaluated and the most promising concept is retained and refined. Eventually, some preliminary structural testing is performed, and the model <b>is</b> updated <b>to</b> reflect the reality more accurately. Eventually, when {{the production of the}} system is nearly complete, the model performance predictions should converge to the actual system performance. Large flexible space structures present a problem in using this approach because they are often too flexible to support their own weight and/or too large to fit inside any laboratory facilities <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tested fully assembled. For example, it would <b>be</b> impractical <b>to</b> test the whole assembly of the International Space Station or SIM on the ground. Also, during the preliminary design phase, no test data <b>are</b> available <b>to</b> update the models. Even when the model is very mature and has been updated after experimental testing, a discrepancy remains between the predicted and actual performance of the system. These uncertainties <b>are</b> due <b>to</b> various sources of variability in the system: variable noises (sources and levels), testing conditions and environmental factors, assembly/reassembly, shipset, disturbance levels, and others. How then, can we have confidence that a particular concept will meet the requirements if the only tool we have are finite element models that may not be accurate? The solution <b>is</b> <b>to</b> try to estimate the range of uncertainty around our nominal model performances. Since in the early design phase no test data <b>are</b> available, our <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> will <b>be</b> <b>to</b> use past experience to predict the expected uncertainty range on the performances of our new design.

40|$|Business {{innovation}} {{is key to}} a creating a highly productive Canadian economy. One concern is that Canadian businesses have relatively low levels of business research and development (R&D), despite access {{to some of the}} world’s most generous R&D tax subsidies. This doesn’t mean that tax credits do not stimulate R&D; indeed, research suggests they do. Rather, low business R&D appears to be rooted in structural aspects of the economy and, more importantly, a lack of demand-related pressure to pursue innovation as a business strategy. This paper looks at the impact of the federal R&D tax credit, and proposes tax options aimed at improving Canada’s innovation performance. It argues that Canada’s <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> focus on creating a competitive tax system across the entire innovation value chain. The current system is mainly designed to “push ” firms to undertake R&D through generous upfront subsidies. Meanwhile, the rewards of innovation—income from intellectual property and new products and services—are taxed at rates that are far less competitive. The federal government should focus its efforts on addressing market “pull ” factors by keeping taxes on the rewards of innovation at internationally competitive levels. It should also consider options to reduce tax disincentives for small, innovative firms to grow into larger, globally competitive companies...|$|E

I was experimenting with signal encoding at the time, and I wanted to look at the scheme used in my remote. One thing led to another, and before I knew it, I was trying to determine the RF frequency at which the transmitter was operating. I then built RF filters to look at signal levels and RF generators to aid in prototyping and testing. Next came RF mixing, frequency doubling, and so on. You can see where I’m going here. I became hooked on RF and all of the art that goes along with getting RF circuits working properly. Currently, all of my design-related pursuits are focused on circuits and test equipment at radio frequencies. When it comes to RF test equipment, the spectrum analyzer is the Holy Grail. Unfortunately, both new and used RF spectrum analyzers are extremely expensive. There are a variety of home-brew spectrum analyzers available on the ’Net. Some are more sophisticated than others because all of the circuit elements are built from scratch. They feature complex filter constructions, have precise PCB layouts that turn PCB traces into inductors, and include a lot of discrete components. Other somewhat simpler designs feature integrated modules borrowed from the TV/VCR tuner world. These are easier to build, but they lack sophistication and functionality. As I was browsing the ’Net for an alternative to a home-brew spectrum analyzer, I stumbled across the Maxim MAX 3550, which seemed almost too good to be true. Not onl...|$|E
30|$|Regardless of the {{challenging}} {{task of the}} toll redistribution, it is highly appealing to merge the two ideas of revenue-neutral and Pareto-improving TSS, where everyone is a winner. For a single origin–destination (O–D) pair, Eliasson [45] showed that compared to the do-nothing scenario, in a revenue-neutral TSS, where the total travel time is reduced, no commuter {{is found to be}} worse off. Liu, Guo and Yang [46] and Nie and Liu [47] examined the existence of Pareto-improving and revenue-neutral pricing scheme in a simple bimodal network consisting of road and a parallel transit line. Results provided by Liu, Guo and Yang [48] suggests that the condition for every user being better off is weaker than the condition for total system travel time reduction. In other words, any revenue-neutral pricing scheme is Pareto-improving as long as it reduces the total system travel time. The results provided by Nie and Liu [47] imply that the revenue-neutral property is a restricting condition which may compromise the existence of a solution. In other words, external subsidies may be required to make every commuter happy (Pareto-improving). Xiao and Zhang [48] showed that on a one-origin or one-destination network, a Pareto-improving, system-optimal and revenue-neutral TSS always exists. It turns out that such a scheme may not always exist for a multiorigin network; hence, they sought the maximum possible revenue collected by the TSS problem subject to the Pareto-improving constrains. Given the results of the above studies, {{it is safe to say}} that maintaining both the Pareto-improving and revenue-neutral properties is difficult; possibly the <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> drop the revenue-neutral in order to secure a solution. Chen and Yang [28] proved that in the context of nonnegative toll schemes and/or toll-cum-rebate schemes for Pareto-efficient control, the TSS always has a solution. Considering that tolls and subsidies are represented by positive and negative values, then, a negative cycle is a distinct closed path along which the sum of the road travel costs is negative. If a negative cycle exists, commuters can make money merely by traversing along the negative cycle. Chen and Yang [28] proved that the TSS—as we set out here—has always a solution, if, loosely speaking, the amount of toll is higher than that of subsidy.|$|E
