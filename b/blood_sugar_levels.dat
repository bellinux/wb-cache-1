5|$|Carbohydrates are {{classified}} {{according to their}} glycemic index, a system for measuring how quickly a food that is eaten raises <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>levels,</b> and glycemic load, which takes into account both the glycemic index {{and the amount of}} carbohydrate in the food. This has led to carbohydrate counting, a method used by diabetics for planning their meals.|$|E
5|$|In general, insulin {{is given}} at 0.1unit/kg per hour {{to reduce the}} blood sugars and {{suppress}} ketone production. Guidelines differ as to which dose to use when <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>levels</b> start falling; some recommend reducing the dose of insulin once glucose falls below 16.6mmol/l (300mg/dl) but other recommend infusing glucose in addition to saline to allow for ongoing infusion of higher doses of insulin.|$|E
25|$|Basal insulin {{requirements}} {{will vary}} between individuals and periods of the day. The basal rate {{for a particular}} time period is determined by fasting while periodically evaluating the <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level.</b> Neither food nor bolus insulin must be taken for 4 hours before or during the evaluation period. If the <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> changes dramatically during evaluation, then the basal rate can be adjusted to increase or decrease insulin delivery to keep the <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> approximately steady.|$|R
50|$|Normal value ranges {{may vary}} {{slightly}} among different laboratories. Many factors affect a person's <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level.</b> A body's homeostatic mechanism, when operating normally, restores the <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> {{to a narrow}} range of about 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L (79.2 to 110 mg/dL) (as measured by a fasting blood glucose test).|$|R
50|$|Similarly, a low <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> or a low glycemic food {{might be}} best treated with a bolus after a meal is begun. The <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level,</b> the type of food eaten, and a person's {{individual}} response to food and insulin affect the ideal time to bolus with the pump.|$|R
5|$|Cortisol is {{the main}} {{glucocorticoid}} in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by corticosterone instead. Glucocorticoids have many effects on metabolism. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of glucose. This {{is the result of}} an increase in the mobilization of amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of free fatty acids, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. Glucocorticoids also have effects unrelated to the regulation of <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>levels,</b> including the suppression of the immune system and a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Cortisol reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} the drug exenatide (marketed as Byetta) {{for the management}} of type 2 diabetes. It is a synthetic version of a protein, exendin-4, derived from the Gila monster's saliva. In a three-year study with people with type 2 diabetes, exenatide led to healthy sustained glucose levels and progressive weight loss. The effectiveness is because the lizard protein is about 50% identical to glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (GLP-1), a hormone released from the human digestive tract that helps to regulate insulin and glucagon. The lizard protein remains effective much longer than the human hormone, helping diabetics keep their <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>levels</b> under control. Exenatide slows the emptying of the stomach and causes a decrease in appetite, contributing to weight loss.|$|E
5|$|Common {{responses}} include: {{pupil dilation}} (93%); changes in heart rate (100%), including increases (56%), decreases (13%), and variable responses (31%); changes {{in blood pressure}} (84%), including hypotension (34%), hypertension (28%), and general instability (22%); changes in stretch reflex (86%), including increases (80%) and decreases (6%); nausea (44%); tremor (25%); and dysmetria (16%) (inability to properly direct or limit motions). The temporary increases in blood pressure caused by the drug can be {{a risk factor for}} users with pre-existing hypertension. These qualitative somatic effects caused by psilocybin have been corroborated by several early clinical studies. A 2005 magazine survey of club goers in the UK found that nausea or vomiting was experienced by over a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the last year, although this effect is caused by the mushroom rather than psilocybin itself. In one study, administration of gradually increasing dosages of psilocybin daily for 21 days had no measurable effect on electrolyte levels, <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>levels,</b> or liver toxicity tests.|$|E

The study result implicated that the <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> was not having any general tendency to increase with advancement of age of ailing dogs. The <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> of ailing dogs was higher in small breeds of dogs, particularly in 0 to < 4 year age group.

5|$|In {{some cases}} {{there may be}} an {{asymptomatic}} phase following the initial symptoms which is then followed by more significant toxicity including kidney damage, liver damage, and neurological dysfunction including seizures and coma. These signs usually develop within 1–3days in serious cases. The patient develops jaundice and the liver and spleen become enlarged, in some cases <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>levels</b> will rise (hyperglycemia) and then fall (hypoglycemia) and liver toxicity is seen. Additionally intravascular hemolysis causes destruction of red blood cells resulting in increase in free hemoglobin and hemoglobinuria which can lead to renal toxicity or renal failure. Methemoglobinemia may also occur in some cases. This is where higher than normal levels of methemoglobin, which is a form of hemoglobin that can not carry oxygen, are found in the blood. It causes the patient to become short of breath and cyanotic. Cases of severe poisoning may progress to a terminal neurological phase, with delirium, muscle fasciculations and seizures, and mydriasis progressing to coma, circulatory collapse, and respiratory arrest. Death may occur from five to seven days after consumption.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{number of}} {{patients}} with diabetes mellitus (DM) in year 2001 was 5. 6 million. In the year 2020, {{it is expected to}} reach 8. 2 million. The diet of DM patients in Pulorejo village comprised low calorie, sugar free, and low fiber diet. Fiber consumed by these patients was taken from vegetables and banana. Unfortunately, the use of such diet keep the patient's <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> remains increasing. The content of water-soluble fiber (pectin) in apple is higher and is able to reduce <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the effect of  apple consumption on <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level.</b> Method: This study was used a quasy-experimental pre-post test purposive sampling design. Samples who met to the inclusion criteria were 14 persons divided into treatment and  control group. Data were analyzed by using Paired t-Test  (α= 0. 05) and Independent t-Test  (α= 0. 05). Result: The result showed that there was an effect of apple consumption on <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> with Paired t-Test (p= 0. 000) for blood glucose level before and after intervention in treatment group, and (p= 0. 100) for blood glucose level before and after intervention in control group. The results of Independent t-Test revealed p= 0. 000 for blood glucose level after intervention in treatment and control groups. Discussion:  It’s can be concluded that there was an effect of apple consumption on <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> in DM patients. The apple should be given in the best dose that can reduce <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level,</b> which is 2 x 150 g. The result of this study can be considered in as a material for diet promotion for the patients. Further studies should be developed to measure the variables of stress and sex of the patients...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of daun nasi infusion (Phyrnium capitatum Willd) in <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> reduction of rats and determine the relationship between the dose of daun nasi infusion (Phyrnium capitatum Willd) and <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> reduction of rats. This study was experimental study with randomized controlled group design, using male Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) that were made hyperglycemia by aloksan 130 mg/bw intravenously. Samples consist of 18 rats which were divided into 6 groups, normal control as a standard of comparison which is not induced by aloksan, positive control (glibenclamide suspension 0. 63 mg/bw), negative control (CMC 0. 5 %), and treatments group with dose 2. 32 g/bw, 4. 64 g/bw and 9. 28 g/bw daily for two weeks period. The study result of <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level,</b> was analyzed by one way ANOVA and LSD test to know the significant differences between groups. The result shows that daun nasi infusion have an effect to reduce <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level,</b> but the most effective dose of daun nasi infusion is 9. 28 g/bw.

40|$|Introduction: Diabetes {{is one of}} {{the major}} public health {{problems}} in Nepal. Very few studies on correlation between waist hip ratio and random <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> have been done in remote areas of Nepal particularly in minor ethnic groups like Thami. This study attempted to compare waist hip ratio and <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> in Thami community of Nepal. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted in sub-health post of Lapilang village of Dolakha district of Nepal. A total of 243 local inhabitants from Thami Tribe participated in the study. Waist hip ratio was calculated after taking measurements of waist and hip using flexible measuring tape; and, blood glucose level was measured by glucometer. Results: The mean age of the participants was 46. 02 years; among participants 126 (51. 9 %) were males and 117 (48. 1 %) were females. Mean waist hip ratio was 0. 87, mean <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> was 124. 5 mg%. Increase in Waist hip ratio correlated significantly with increase in random <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> both in males(p= 0. 008) and females(p= 0. 007). Conclusions: Increase in waist hip ratio is associated with increase in random <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level.</b> Therefore, there is a need of public awareness program to reduce waist circumference thus reducing weight of people to prevent development of diabetes mellitus in long run.
