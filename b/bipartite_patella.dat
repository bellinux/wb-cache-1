40|$|Thirteen skeletons were {{excavated}} in the Pilanesberg National Park {{and represent}} {{a relatively large}} collection of Iron Age remains from a single location. The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe these remains by examining age at death, disease and trauma. Standard anthropological techniques were used and bone infections, dental caries, antemortem tooth loss, periapical abscesses, periodontal disease and enamel hypoplasia were macroscopically assessed. Six skeletons were male, three female, and four of unknown sex. Estimated age ranged from three juveniles (< 14 years), five young adults (18 to 30 years), and five middle to older aged adults (+ 30 years). A case of osteomyelitis, one healed fracture, a humeral deformation, two cases of dental mutilation, and two people with <b>bipartite</b> <b>patellae</b> were observed. Dental diseases included dental caries, antemortem tooth loss, and enamel hypoplasia. Periapical abscesses were noted on three people and periodontal disease on two. Dental ailments were minimal and age-related diseases, such as antemortem tooth loss and periapical abscesses, were noted only in older individuals.

50|$|<b>Bipartite</b> <b>patella,</b> {{also known}} as Patella bipartita is a {{condition}} where the patella, or kneecap, is composed of two separate bones. Instead of fusing together as normally occurs in early childhood, {{the bones of the}} patella remain separated. The condition occurs in approximately 12% of the population and is nine times more likely to occur in males than females. It is often asymptomatic and most commonly diagnosed as an incidental finding, with about 2% of cases becoming symptomatic.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} case of 32 -year-old male who had a painful knee due to tophus {{formation}} in the interosseous area of the <b>bipartite</b> <b>patella.</b> There was neither a history of previous trauma to his patella nor {{a family history of}} gouty arthritis. Intraoperatively, we found chalky white-yellow material deposited at the bipartite space and it was curetted. The second part of the patella was fixed by a screw for functional preservation. In addition, hyperuricemia was also noted and controlled by uricosuric agents postoperatively.

40|$|Excision of the {{accessory}} bipartite fragment is widely used, but its long-term outcome is not known. We evaluated the outcome after surgical excision of a symptomatic accessory bipartite or multipartite patella fragment in young adult men performing their {{compulsory military service}} and determined the incidence of painful bipartite patellae in this group of skeletally mature adults. We followed 25 of 32 patients {{for a minimum of}} 10  years (mean, 15  years; range, 10 – 22  years). The incidence of painful, surgically treated <b>bipartite</b> <b>patella</b> was 9. 2 per 100, 000 recruits. Patients’ median age at surgery was 20  years. There were 19 superolateral and six lateral bipartite fragments. Other radiographic findings were rare. At followup, the Kujala score mean was 95 points (range, 75 – 100 points), and osteoarthrotic changes (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 1) were seen in two knees. No reoperations related to <b>bipartite</b> <b>patella</b> occurred during the followup. Symptomatic <b>bipartite</b> <b>patella</b> is rare and does not seem primarily associated with anatomic deviations, but when incapacitating pain persists despite nonoperative treatment, surgical excision seems to yield reasonable functional outcome and quick recovery with no apparent adverse sequelae. Our data suggest {{there is no reason to}} avoid this technically undemanding procedure for treating persistent symptoms of <b>bipartite</b> <b>patella</b> in young adults...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the most effective method {{for the treatment of}} the symptomatic <b>bipartite</b> <b>patella.</b> Methods: A systematic review of the literature was completed, and all studies assessing the management of a <b>bipartite</b> <b>patella</b> were included. Owing to the paucity of randomised controlled trials, a narrative review of 22 studies was completed. A range of treatments were assessed: conservative measures, open and arthroscopic fixation or excision and soft tissue release and excision. Results: All of the methods provided results ranging from good to excellent, with acceptable complication rates. Conclusions: This is a poorly answered treatment question. No firm guidance can be given as to the most appropriate method of treating the symptomatic <b>bipartite</b> <b>patella.</b> This study suggests {{that there are a number}} of effective treatments with acceptable complication rates and it may be that treatments that conserve the patella are more appropriate for larger fragments...|$|E
40|$|Objective: <b>Bipartite</b> <b>patella</b> is {{accepted}} as a normal anatomic variant of patella, and is identified incidentally on knee radiographs taken for other reasons. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of <b>bipartite</b> <b>patella</b> without bone marrow edema. Materials and Methods: In total, 1. 000 patients were evaluated retrospectively. Imaging was performed on 1. 5 T MRI unit using extremity coil. A standardized knee protocol was used. The obtained images were thereafter analyzed by two experienced radiologists in consensus. Results: Of the 18 patients, six were female and twelve were male. The mean age of the group was 42. 1 ± 23. 5 years. The bipartite fragments were located in the superolateral aspect of the patella. In 16 knees, only one fragment was recognized. The average transverse diameter of the patellar fragment was 11. 6 ± 8. 1 mm. In the axial plane, the average distance between the fragment and the main patella was 1. 67 ± 1. 1 mm. Continuity of the patellar cartilage on the fragment was observed in all patients. The mean fragment cartilage thickness was 1. 9 ± 1 mm and the patellar cartilage thickness was 3. 8 ± 2. 3 mm. Cartilage signal was present in ten knees, fluid signal was present in six knees, and fibrous signal was present in four knees in the synchondrosis region. Conclusion: A defining feature of <b>bipartite</b> <b>patella</b> without accompanying edema in the bone marrow is a thinner-thannormal cartilage covering the fragments, and an overall cartilage signal over the area of the synchondrosis. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Tophaceous gout of the patella is {{rare and}} may {{masquerade}} as a tumour or tumour-like condition. Cases. We report two patients with gout involving the patella, one complicated by a pathological fracture {{and the other}} occurring in a <b>bipartite</b> <b>patella</b> in a young adult. Discussion. Typical imaging appearances and measurement of serum urate will usually confirm the diagnosis but, occasionally, the serum urate level may be normal in active gout and in such cases, a biopsy will be required.

40|$|A 40 -year-old woman {{presented}} with bilateral knee pain following a motorcyclecollision. She had no prior history {{of pain in}} her knees. Physical examination re-vealed abrasions, swelling, ecchymosis and tenderness of both knees. There was no obvious limitation to range of motion, either active or passive, {{and she was able}} to ac-tively extend her knees. Radiographs of the knees showed a smooth, regular, semilunar radiolucent defect at the superolateral pole of each patella (Figure 1). <b>Bipartite</b> <b>patella</b> is a developmental variation in which the patella develops from 2 ossifi-cation centres. 1 It occurs in about 2 %– 6 % of the population, with a male predominance (ra-tio 8 : 1). It is bilateral in 43 % of patients. 2 In 1943 Saupe proposed the following radiologi-cal classification based on the position of the accessory ossification centre: 3 type I (5 % prevalence) involves the inferior pole of the patella and poses a high risk for fracture. Oper-ative fixation may be required if there is disruption of the extensor mechanism. In type II (20 % prevalence), the defect is located along the lateral patellar margin. The defect in the type III variant (75 % prevalence), seen in our patient, is located at the superolateral pole of the patella. Most patients with <b>bipartite</b> <b>patella</b> have no symptoms and do not require treat-ment or referral. If there is no disruption to the extensor mechanism, symptomatic patients usually respond well to physiotherapy and analgesics. For a minority of patients for whom nonoperative treatment is ineffective, surgical excision of the bone fragment may be consid-ered. Rarely, surgical repair is indicated when the synchondrosis has been fractured and there is loss of active extension. At last follow-up, our patient was doing well with physio-therapy and analgesics.

30|$|Patellar {{fractures}} {{are rare}} but {{can lead to}} significant clinical deficits, especially when associated with an injury to the extensor mechanism. Diagnosis and accurate classification are important for timely and appropriate management. The most common patellar fractures are transverse, which are secondary to indirect injury, while direct blows typically result in comminuted fractures. Vertical fractures are less common, but may easily be missed on AP radiographs, warranting careful assessment of skyline views. Special care {{should be taken to}} examine for displacement, as it may indicate an associated retinacular injury and the need for surgical management. <b>Bipartite</b> <b>patella</b> is an important differential diagnosis of patellar fracture. Management of patellar fractures depends on a number of issues, including clinical presentation and degree of displacement. A wide variety of surgical and non-surgical options are available.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} case of near {{identical}} patellar fractures in adolescent monozygotic twins who are both high-level competitive gymnasts. These patients presented 14 months apart with almost identical history and clinical findings. Both had an intense training regime involving over 30 hours per week of load-bearing exercise. Clinical and radiological examinations suggested avulsion or sleeve fracture of the inferior pole of the patella with minimal displacement. Diagnoses of patellar stress fracture with avulsion of the distal pole and symptomatic <b>bipartite</b> <b>patella</b> could not be reliably excluded. Both fractures were treated conservatively with immobilisation of the knee in extension. An excellent functional result was observed in both patients with return to full activity at 8 weeks. This is the first published case of identical injury to the patella in monozygotic twins. A significant genetic influence on bone mineral density (BMD) has been reported and low BMD is associated with increased susceptibility to fracture. These injuries corroborate a genetic influence on susceptibility to fracture. There is a requirement for further work to investigate genetic factors influencing susceptibility to fracture. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAim of the workThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the MRI features of some uncommon causes of knee pain. Materials and methodsThis is a retrospective study. We reviewed our database including the last 1000 knee MRI examinations done within the period from January 2012 till June 2013. This revision revealed 12 cases with reported variable uncommon diagnoses explaining knee pain. Unenhanced MRI of the knee was performed and included sagittal T 1, T 2, T 2 ∗ and proton density fat suppression (PDFS), axial T 2 and coronal PDFS. Some cases had complementary CT assessment. ResultsThe selected 12 cases included the following; three cases of supero-lateral Hoffa’s pad of fat edema expressing edema signal at the superolateral aspect of the Hoffa’s pad of fat. Three cases with fabella syndrome with chondral and subchondral edema signal at the posterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. Two cases with symptomatic <b>bipartite</b> <b>patella</b> showing marrow edema around the patellar synostosis. One case with proximal tibio-fibular synostosis evident on MRI as bony fusion. Two cases with quadriceps (suprapatellar) fat-pad impingement syndrome manifested as edema signal within the supra-patellar fat-pad and lastly one case with lipoma arborescence seen as frond like projections with fat signal protruding into the supra-patellar bursa.
