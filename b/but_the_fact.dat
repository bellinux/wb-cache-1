5|$|Giron and Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz {{claimed that}} the recall defeat was due to voter {{suppression}}. The Denver Post disputed this, saying that the result wasn't caused by voter suppression <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that more people showed up to vote against Giron than to vote for her. Gessler said that the Democrats fared worse where more people turned out. Wasserman Schultz also stated that the money spent by the NRA and the Koch brothers {{made it impossible for}} Democrats to win.|$|E
5|$|In summary, {{the main}} {{competencies}} of the Tagora were its spacious cabin (though {{it was not}} class-leading), its comfortable seating, its fuel economy (in 2.2 GLS form) {{and the size of}} its luggage compartment (572 litres). <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that a car launched in 1974, the Volvo 244 GLE, could offer better seats, disc brakes all round, better headlights, better ventilation and better handling for only slightly more than Talbot was charging for their car indicated that the Tagora had come to market with a vehicle that was uncompetitive in too many major respects.|$|E
5|$|After the council, Cuthbert {{continued}} {{to correspond with}} Boniface up until Boniface's martyrdom in 754, and then sent condolences to Boniface's successor. Cuthbert held a second synod in 758, but nothing is known of any enactments it made. He also built the church of St. John the Baptist in Canterbury, which was destroyed by fire in 1067. He was buried in his new church. The new church was located {{on the west side}} of the cathedral, and was used as a baptistery. The church also became a burial site for many of the archbishops, and later was used for trials by ordeal. There is no explicit contemporary reference that states that these uses were intended by Cuthbert, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the church was dedicated to St. John the Baptist argues strongly that Cuthbert at least intended the new building as a baptistery.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{frequent}} mentioning of the Diolkos {{in connection with}} military operations, modern scholarship assumes that the prime purpose of the trackway {{must have been the}} transport of cargo, considering that warships cannot have needed transporting very often, and ancient historiography was always more interested in war than commerce. Comments by Pliny the Elder and Strabo, which described the Diolkos as being in regular service during times of peace, also imply a commercial use of the trackway. Coinciding with the rise of monumental architecture in Greece, the construction of the Diolkos may have initially served particularly for transporting heavy goods like marble, monoliths and timber to points west and east. It is not known what tolls Corinth could extract from the Diolkos on its territory, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the trackway was used and maintained long after its construction indicates that it remained for merchant ships an attractive alternative to the trip around Cape Malea for much of antiquity.|$|E
5|$|In 866, a major Arab raid along Dalmatia struck Budva and Kotor, {{and then}} laid siege to Dubrovnik in 867. The city appealed to Byzantine Emperor Basil the Macedonian, who responded by sending {{over one hundred}} ships. Finally, the 866–867 Saracens' siege of Dubrovnik, which lasted fifteen months, was raised due to the {{intervention}} of Basil I, who sent a fleet {{under the command of}} Niketas Oryphas in relief of the city. After this successful intervention, the Byzantine navy sailed along the coast collecting promises of loyalty to the empire from the Dalmatian cities. The damage done by Saracens is not known, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Dubrovnik managed to survive a fifteen-month-long siege, proves how well the city was fortified.|$|E
5|$|Initially Guerrero worked lower card matches, in the first-to-third {{match on}} the show with some success. On September 11, 1998 he {{defeated}} Mr. Águila in his first ever Lucha de Apuestas match, forcing his opponent to unmask and reveal his real name {{as part of the}} CMLL 65th Anniversary Show. Mr. Águila already worked for the World Wrestling Federation without his mask, so it was not seen as a surprise that he lost to Guerrero. In 1999 Último Guerrero teamed up with veteran Blue Panther to win the Gran Alternativa ("Grea Alternative") tournament, a tournament where a young wrestler teams with a veteran. Winning the Gran Alternativa tournament is often a sign that the promotion has plans to move a wrestler up the rankings. Shortly after winning the tournament, Guerrero won a match that made him the number one contender for Great Sasuke's NWA World Middleweight Championship. Último Guerrero did not win the match <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he worked a featured match in CMLL's main arena, Arena México, showed that the company had plans for him.|$|E

5|$|It {{had long}} been {{established}} Marcher custom to solve conflicts through private warfare. Hereford's problem, however, was his relative weakness in the Marches, {{and now he was}} facing open conflict with two different enemies. He therefore decided to take the issue to the king instead, in a break with tradition. King Edward again ordered Gloucester to stop, but the earl ignored the order and initiated raids on Hereford's lands. Hostilities continued and Hereford responded, until both earls were arrested and brought before the king. The real offense was not the private warfare in itself, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the earls had not respected the king's injunction to cease. In the parliament of January 1292, Gloucester was fined 10,000 marks and Hereford 1,000. Gloucester's liberty of Glamorgan was declared forfeit, and confiscated by the crown, as was Hereford's of Brecon.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} that the developers faced was in adding enough elements to Metroid: Zero Mission to make it feel new, while keeping the spirit of the original Metroid. Because both games were made for the Game Boy Advance, Metroid: Zero Mission uses a rebuilt version of the game engine used for Metroid Fusion so that it {{did not need to be}} built from scratch. This marked the first time two Metroid installments have been released for the same video game console. Metroid Fusion had offered connectivity with Metroid Prime on the Nintendo GameCube, but Metroid: Zero Mission did not offer such a feature. Sakamoto explained that the developers wanted to make the game connect to Metroid Prime 2: Echoes on the GameCube, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that both their release dates were far apart and not enough development time to implement connectivity features prevented them from doing so. However, they managed to include the ability for Metroid Fusion to connect with Metroid: Zero Mission.|$|E
5|$|Sam Jones III was {{the last}} of the season one series regulars to be cast–being hired just four days before filming for the pilot episode began. Jones, who is African American, was also cast against the Superman mythology where Pete Ross is Caucasian. Jones has stated that he would have {{understood}} if the producers had simply created a black character for him to portray, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they chose to go with him, even though the character has always been white, gave him more honor {{to be a part of}} the show. During the first season, Jones felt like he should have more screen time, but later conceded that the show was about Clark's journey and that the other characters are there to help his story move along.|$|E

5|$|The fourth {{series in}} 2010 was {{executive}} produced by Russell T Davies and Nikki Wilson, and the producers were Brian Minchin and frequent writer Phil Ford. During this series, Cyril Nri was introduced {{as a new}} recurring character called The Shopkeeper. The production team remained {{in place for the}} completed episodes of Series 5, which were shot concurrently with Series 4. The show's abbreviated fifth and final series introduced a new main character named Sky, played by Sinead Michael. The episode that introduced Sky also featured a return appearance by the Shopkeeper, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that {{the second half of the}} series was never produced left his story arc, as well as other ongoing plot points, unresolved. A special edition of Doctor Who Magazine, The Sarah Jane Companion Volume 3, published in August 2012, detailed the plotlines of the three unfilmed stories.|$|E
