5|$|Collegiate teams {{participating}} in the IARC have come primarily from the United States and the Peoples Republic of China, but also from Germany, England, Switzerland, Spain, Canada, Chile, Qatar, Iran, and India.

Both undergraduate and graduate students populate the teams, but some teams have been composed entirely of undergraduates or postgraduates. Industry is not permitted to enter, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> assist the student teams with funding and equipment.|$|E
5|$|In October 2014 Elgato {{released}} {{a new version}} called HD 60. It recorded in 60 frames per second and 1080p high definition video, whereas typical low-end video game recording devices capture in 720p and 30 frames per second. The Telegraph gave it {{four out of five}} stars. A review in Gizmodo said that it captured extremely high-quality footage, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be higher-end than needed for many gamers that would be satisfied with the recording features built into the console.|$|E

5|$|Zhenyuanlong {{preserves}} wing feathers {{that are}} aerodynamically shaped, with particularly bird-like coverts {{as opposed to}} the longer, wider-spanning coverts of forms like Archaeopteryx and Anchiornis, as well as fused sternal plates. Due to its size and short arms it is unlikely that Zhenyuanlong was capable of powered flight (though the importance of biomechanical modelling in this regard is stressed), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> suggest a relatively close descendance from flying ancestors, or even some capacity for gliding or wing-assisted incline running.|$|E
5|$|Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is synchronised within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps must {{move away from}} their natal tree {{in order to find}} figs in which to lay their eggs. This is to the advantage of the fig, since it prevents self-pollination. In Florida, individual F. aurea trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be an adaptation that allows the species to maintain an adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E

5|$|Another large {{building}} lies crosswise at {{the south}} end of the east range. Its lower level consists of a vaulted hall equipped with a grand thirteenth century hooded fireplace and its own garderobe. It is not clear what this chamber was used for, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have been the monastic infirmary—if so, it was a most unusual, perhaps unique, arrangement. Normally in a medieval Cistercian monastery an infirmary with its own kitchens, chapel and ancillary buildings would have been located east of the main buildings around a second, smaller cloister, but at Netley these seem to be absent. So far, excavations have not revealed whether Netley had a separate infirmary complex.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{the fourth}} largest of the Uranian moons, and may have the third {{greatest}} mass. The moon's density is 1.66g/cm3, which indicates that it consists of roughly equal parts water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could consist of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} the moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Ariel's leading hemisphere than on its trailing hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be related to bombardment by charged particles from Uranus's magnetosphere, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E
5|$|Crude glyphs {{have been}} found on a few stone objects and some {{additional}} wooden items, {{but most of these}} are thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market. Several of the 26 wooden texts are suspect due to uncertain provenance (X, Y, and Z), poor quality craftsmanship (F, K, V, W, Y, and Z), or to having been carved with a steel blade (K, V, and Y), and thus, although they may prove to be genuine, should not be trusted in initial attempts at decipherment. Z resembles many early forgeries in not being boustrophedon, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be a palimpsest on an authentic but now illegible text.|$|E

5|$|DKA most {{frequently}} occurs {{in those who}} already have diabetes, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> also be the first presentation in someone who had not previously been known to be diabetic. There is often a particular underlying problem {{that has led to}} the DKA episode; this may be intercurrent illness (pneumonia, influenza, gastroenteritis, a urinary tract infection), pregnancy, inadequate insulin administration (e.g. defective insulin pen device), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke or the use of cocaine. Young people with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying eating disorder, or may be using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause weight gain.|$|E
5|$|Dilation and {{curettage}} or an {{endometrial biopsy}} {{are used to}} obtain a tissue sample for histological examination. Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> not give conclusive results every time. Hysteroscopy only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium, which is often not indicative of cancer, and is therefore not used, unless {{in conjunction with a}} biopsy. Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. New evidence shows that D has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.|$|E
5|$|Enaliarctos, {{a fossil}} species of late Oligocene/early Miocene (24–22 mya) California, closely resembled modern pinnipeds; it was adapted to an aquatic {{life with a}} {{flexible}} spine, and limbs modified into flippers. Its teeth were adapted for shearing (like terrestrial carnivorans), {{and it may have}} stayed near shore more often than its extant relatives. Enaliarctos was capable of swimming with both the fore-flippers and hind-flippers, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have been more specialized as a fore-flipper swimmer. One species, Enaliarctos emlongi, exhibited notable sexual dimorphism, suggesting that this physical characteristic may have been an important driver of pinniped evolution. A closer relative of extant pinnipeds was Pteronarctos, which lived in Oregon 19–15 mya. As in modern seals, Pteroarctos had an orbital wall that was not limited by certain facial bones (like the jugal or lacrimal bone), but was mostly shaped by the maxilla.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Mid-County Expressway, in 1996 the Interstate 476 designation was extended to include {{the entire length of the}} existing Northeast Extension, replacing PA 9. The Northeast Extension was built between 1955 and 1957 and was originally projected to continue past Clarks Summit to the New York border; however, I-81 was built between these two points instead. Since the extension, I-476 has been the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway in the United States (surpassing Interstate 495 in Massachusetts), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> someday be surpassed in length by Interstate 369 in Texas. In fact, it is longer than some mainline interstates (such as Interstate 83 in Maryland and Pennsylvania, Interstate 99 in Pennsylvania, Interstate 12 in Louisiana, Interstate 19 in Arizona, Interstate 97 in Maryland, and Interstate 2 in Texas). Additionally, its numbering is unusual, since auxiliary interstates beginning in even numbers are typically bypasses or loops rather than spurs.|$|E
5|$|Historically, people repored that Fragile Allegiance did {{not work}} {{properly}} on Windows XP and later Windows platforms, as the game was designed for MS-DOS and ported to Windows 95. The most common issues being reported are no audio, the game failing to start, and the game crashing when trying to rename anything, including saved games. As no patch was ever released for the game, people have had to use emulators such as VDMSound or DOSBox {{in order to get}} the game to function properly <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> still crash when trying to rename a saved game.|$|E
5|$|Hypogeomys australis is an extinct rodent {{from central}} and southeastern Madagascar. First {{described}} in 1903, it {{is larger than}} its close relative, the living Hypogeomys antimena, which occurs further west, but otherwise similar. Average length of the femur (upper leg bone) is 72.1mm, compared to 63.8mm in H.antimena. One of the few extinct rodents of Madagascar, it survived to at least around 1536 BP based on radiocarbon dating. Little is known of its ecology, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have lived in burrows like its living relative and eaten some arid-adapted plants.|$|E
