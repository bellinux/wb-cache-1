25|$|<b>Baffle</b> Design: <b>baffles</b> {{are used}} in shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} to direct fluid across the tube bundle. They run perpendicularly to the shell and hold the bundle, preventing the tubes from sagging over a long length. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. The {{most common type of}} <b>baffle</b> is the segmental <b>baffle.</b> The semicircular segmental <b>baffles</b> are oriented at 180 degrees to the adjacent <b>baffles</b> forcing the fluid to flow upward and downwards between the tube bundle. <b>Baffle</b> spacing is of large thermodynamic concern when designing shell and tube heat exchangers. <b>Baffles</b> must be spaced with consideration for the conversion of pressure drop and heat transfer. For thermo economic optimization it is suggested that the <b>baffles</b> be spaced no closer than 20% of the shell’s inner diameter. Having <b>baffles</b> spaced too closely causes a greater pressure drop because of flow redirection. Consequently, having the <b>baffles</b> spaced too far apart means that there may be cooler spots in the corners between <b>baffles.</b> It is also important to ensure the <b>baffles</b> are spaced close enough that the tubes do not sag. The other main type of <b>baffle</b> is the disc and doughnut <b>baffle,</b> which consists of two concentric <b>baffles.</b> An outer, wider <b>baffle</b> looks like a doughnut, whilst the inner <b>baffle</b> is shaped like a disk. This type of <b>baffle</b> forces the fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through the doughnut <b>baffle</b> generating a different type of fluid flow.|$|R

To reduce the negative effect of longitudinal liquid sloshing on tankers, {{three kinds of}} transverse <b>baffles</b> were designed, namely, the conventional <b>baffle,</b> the circular <b>baffle,</b> and the staggered <b>baffle.</b> Each kind of <b>baffle</b> took several forms to investigate the impact of <b>baffle</b> installation angle, the sizes of holes pierced on the <b>baffle,</b> and their arrangement on the antisloshing effect.

Mass transfer coefficients of individual tubes compare favourably with those obtained previously by another mass transfer technique. Experimental data are reported for a variety of segmental <b>baffle</b> configurations over the shell-side Reynolds number range 100 to 42 000. <b>Baffles</b> with zero clearances were studied at three <b>baffle</b> cuts and two <b>baffle</b> spacings. <b>Baffle</b> geometry is shown to have a large effect on the distribution of tube coefficients within the <b>baffle</b> compartment.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Transient {{computational}} fluid dynamic modeling {{in laboratory}} frame of reference was used to investigate <b>baffled</b> tube ram accelerator operating characteristics in inert and reactive mixtures. The minimum entrance Mach number that allowed supersonic projectile transit through a <b>baffled</b> tube filled with inert gas and the thrust generated in reactive flow were examined. The primary parameters considered were chamber-to-projectile diameter ratio, projectile geometry, <b>baffle</b> thickness, <b>baffle</b> spacing and <b>baffle</b> geometry. Axisymmetric and three-dimensional simulations used a dynamic mesh for a projectile moving at constant Mach (ranging from 1. 8 to 5. 1) through stationary <b>baffles.</b> The maximum <b>baffle</b> thickness and minimum <b>baffle</b> spacing at velocities near the minimum allowable entrance Mach number were both found to be ~ 53 % of the projectile diameter. Further reducing the <b>baffle</b> spacing resulted in the projectile pushing a normal shockwave ahead of it like in a jet engine unstart. It was also found that thicker <b>baffles</b> and closer <b>baffle</b> spacing increased the projectile drag coefficient. Reactive flow phenomena were investigated by first establishing the combustion on the projectile in a smooth bore tube before it entered the baffled-tube section. A key finding from premixed methane and oxygen propellant simulations was that aftward-slanted <b>baffles</b> generated higher thrust than when the <b>baffles</b> were normal to the projectile or forward-slanted. This increase in thrust was associated with more complete propellant combustion in the annular <b>baffle</b> chambers around the tail and base sections of the axisymmetric projectile, as well as immediately behind it.
