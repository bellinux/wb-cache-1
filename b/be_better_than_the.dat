The album was released only {{months after the}} breakup of Uncle Tupelo, an alternative country band that was the predecessor of Wilco. Prior to its release, there was debate about whether the album would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> debut album of Son Volt, the new band of former Uncle Tupelo lead singer Jay Farrar.|$|E

The incident was reported on WWE.com, with both men telling their sides of the story. The fight was believed to stem from the idea that Batista considered himself to <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> rest of the roster due to his main event status and relatively quick climb to achieve it. It was said that wrestlers backstage were praising Booker for speaking his mind to Batista about his attitude.|$|E

Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E

Next Generation and Marcus Hawkins (N64 Magazine) agreed that Tekken2 and Virtua Fighter2 had outclassed Killer Instinct Gold. N64 concluded {{that even in the}} Nintendo64's then-meager catalog of titles, Killer Instinct Gold did not distinguish itself, and thus had a lifespan of [...] "weeks rather than months". Killer Instinct Gold waned from a celebrated announcement to a quiet European release.|$|E

500|$|Nintendo Power {{called the}} music in The Demon Slayer {{surprisingly}} good. Cleveland also liked it, and said that it always fits in with all the situations it is played in. Kalata and Snelgrove called it catchy. Don at Square Enix Music Online said that The Demon Slayer has a solid soundtrack for a Game Boy role-playing game, and specifically highlighted [...] "Opening" [...] as a well-composed piece, with its [...] "exotic and mysterious" [...] atmosphere. Patrick Gann at RPGFan said that The Demon Slayer has fantastic and under-appreciated music, but that the soundtrack is short. Don found the soundtrack of Last Bible II to <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> first game's, and said that several pieces, including [...] "Temple", [...] "Field", [...] "Boss Battle", and [...] "Dungeon", were better {{than their counterparts in}} the first game. He said that [...] "Gaia", the piece that is played during the final boss battle, probably was the best of all pieces in the first two games. Gann did also find Last Bible IIs music to <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> first game's. He liked that the soundtrack was longer than the first game's, and how he could not find any melodies that had been [...] "borrowed" [...] from The Demon Slayers soundtrack. Gann found Last Bible IIIs sound font to be weak, but liked several of the compositions. Both Don and Gann thought that Another Bibles music was worse than {{the music in}} previous games in the series. Don did however appreciate several pieces, including [...] "Beginning Moment", which he thought was catchy and had a fantastic melody, and [...] "Hiding All Feeling Inside", which he found to be the most successful piece in the game's soundtrack.|$|E

[...] An anonymous review in the September 1801 British Critic claimed, [...] "A more complete monument of vile and depraved taste no man ever raised [...] He has, therefore, given a rhapsody of Twelve Books {{in a sort of}} irregular lyric, so unlike verse or sense, that if it were worth while to present our readers with a tissue of so coarse a texture, we could fill whole pages with specimens of its absurdity.

500|$|Evil Dead II {{was filmed}} and {{released}} in 1987, {{and was also}} a box-office success. A second, and currently final, sequel was released in 1993, Army of Darkness. Campbell returned as the lead character Ash Williams in both films. At that time, Raimi had become a successful director, attracting Hollywood's interest. His 1990 superhero film Darkman was another box-office success, which led to an increased budget for Army of Darkness. Army of Darkness had 22.8 times {{the budget of the}} original Evil Dead, though it was not considered to be a box-office success like its two predecessors. Evil Dead II received general acclaim from critics and is often considered to <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> original, and Army of Darkness received mostly positive reviews. The series has often attracted attention because each sequel featured more comedic qualities than the last, progressing into [...] "weirder" [...] territory with each film.|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} {{slightly}} varying accounts {{of why the}} bill for the three-cent nickel passed.

The bill made the new coin legal tender to sixty cents. [...] The 1864 act had made the cent legal tender to ten cents, and the two-cent piece to twenty; both limits were reduced to four cents. [...] The bill did not abolish the three-cent silver piece, which was still being struck in small quantities. The new copper-nickel coins would be issued in exchange for three-cent shinplasters—the Currency Bureau was instructed to print no more three-cent notes.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{negotiation}} difficulties, the Boston Red Sox eventually signed Matsuzaka. The team paid approximately $103.1million in total, including the transfer fee and contract, {{to acquire the}} pitcher. Kurkjian believes that with fees and contracts this high, small-market teams {{could not afford to}} compete with large-market teams for the rights to negotiate with some posted Japanese players. Kurkjian blames the posting system's use of a blind bidding system as the cause of Matsuzaka's [...] "outrageous offer." [...] He also postulates that Matsuzaka's high bid amount helped to inflate the bids for Kei Igawa who was posted two weeks later, perpetuating the problem further. After winning {{the negotiation}} rights to Igawa, Yankees' general manager Brian Cashman told reporters that [...] "the posting system, clearly with what took place this winter, might not necessarily be the best system". Kurkjian claims that other MLB executives already believe that a traditional free agent structure, where the highest bidder wins, would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> current system. Cashman and Yankees team president Randy Levine met with NPB team officials in early 2007 to discuss the posting system, among other things.

It ought to, at any rate, because that story is plainly wrought out and is apparent as it is possible to make it." [...] A review in The Nickelodeon offered little more than a summary of the film, but the reviewer found the subject to be enhanced by the attention to detail in the production. The reviewer was also pleased that the child was not brought in to serve as in deus ex machina role. Though Lonergan was fond of using the technique.

500|$|After a {{short period}} of inactivity, Dickinson once again teamed up with Roy Z and Tribe of Gypsies to record his next album, Accident of Birth; [...] "It was {{actually}} Roy that dragged me back into some assemblance, because he called up and he said, 'Listen, I've got some stuff and it's like a metal record.' And I wasn't thrilled, I wasn't really sure that I had anything to offer... Then he played me some backing-tracks he'd done for what was to become Accident of Birth down the phone and I thought 'There is something there.'" [...] Former Iron Maiden guitarist, Adrian Smith, was asked to guest on the record, but remained as a full-time member of Dickinson's solo outfit. The album marked a return to heavy metal for Dickinson, with Sputnikmusic remarking, [...] "The album's heavy feel is very satisfying, and definitely fills that void left by Maiden during the 90's." [...] The follow-up, The Chemical Wedding, was a semi-concept album on alchemy, which drew inspiration from William Blake's writings; with some songs, such as [...] "Book of Thel", having the same title as some of his poems, and the cover artwork featuring one of his paintings. The record was even more successful than its predecessor, with Sputnikmusic commenting, [...] "Bruce had shattered all expectations to create an album that might even <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> previous one."

However, Madoc received mixed reviews from critics; while one critic believed it was comparable to John Milton's Paradise Lost, another {{felt that it was}} unreadable. In letter written by William Wordsworth on 3 June 1805, he claimed that he was [...] "highly pleased with it; it abounds in beautiful pictures and descriptions happily introduced, and there is an animation diffused through the whole story though it cannot perhaps be said that any of the characters interest you much, except perhaps young Llewllyn whose situation is highly interesting, and he appears to me the best conceived and sustained character in the piece [...] The Poem fails in the highest gifts of the poet's mind Imagination in the true sense of the word, and knowledge of human Nature and human heart. There is nothing that shows the hand of the great Master". He followed this with a letter on 29 July 1805 saying [...] "Southey's mind does not seem strong enough to draw the picture of a Hero. The character of Madoc is often very insipid and contemptible [...] In short, according to my notion, the character is throughout languidly conceived". Dorothy Wordsworth, William's sister, wrote on 11 June 1805 to claim that [...] "We have read Madoc with great delight [...] I had one painful feeling throughout, that I did not care as much about Madoc as the Author wished me to do, and that the characters in general are not sufficiently distinct to make them have a separate after-existence in my affection." ...|$|E
