5|$|The {{internal}} carotid arteries supply oxygenated <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{front of}} the brain and the vertebral arteries supply <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of the brain. These two circulations join together in the circle of Willis, a ring of connected arteries that lies in the interpeduncular cistern between the midbrain and pons.|$|E
5|$|The left {{ventricle}} is much thicker {{as compared with}} the right, due to the greater force needed to pump <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entire body. Like the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there is no moderator band. The {{left ventricle}} pumps <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body through the aortic valve and into the aorta. Two small openings above the aortic valve carry <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart itself, the left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery.|$|E
5|$|Primitive {{fish have}} a four-chambered heart, but the {{chambers}} are arranged sequentially {{so that this}} primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood, from the body, through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium {{and then to the}} powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several valves and sends <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery).|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{promotion}} for the event, Hogan appeared on Hot Properties four days prior to WrestleMania, where he put host Richard Belzer into a front chinlock —a move that cuts off the flow of <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain. Belzer, however, {{fell to the floor}} unconscious and began to bleed profusely. His injury required eight stitches. Belzer later sued Hogan for $5million, but they eventually settled out of court. The night before WrestleMania, Hogan and Mr. T hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live to help promote the event.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} related genus Barosaurus, the very long neck of Diplodocus {{is the source}} of much {{controversy}} among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart — a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary 'hearts' in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next 'heart'. Some argue that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and neck}} would have eliminated the problem of supplying <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain, as it would not be elevated.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{was viewed}} as a potent source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> effects of theophylline on respiratory muscle blood flow in 11 lightly anesthetized and spontaneously breathing dogs using the radioactive microsphere tracer technique. During quiet breathing, <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> costal diaphragm (25. 1 +/- 13. 9 ml/ 100 g/min) exceeded <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parasternal intercostals (18. 0 +/- 10. 2 ml/ 100 g/min, p < 0. 05). Inspiratory resistive loading abolished these differences by increasing <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parasternal intercostals more than <b>to</b> <b>the</b> diaphragm. Aminophylline (40 mg/kg) significantly increased minute ventilation and tidal transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) swing during quiet breathing but not during inspiratory resistive loading. Theophylline did not affect diaphragmatic blood flow during inspiratory resistive loading while the same Pdi swing and tension-time index (TTdi) were reached. During quiet breathing, however, theophylline significantly (p < 0. 05) increased <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> triangularis sterni from 7. 9 +/- 5. 6 to 18. 1 +/- 25. 6 ml/ 100 g/min and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> transversus abdominis from 10. 8 +/- 8. 4 to 14. 6 +/- 10. 5 ml/ 100 g/min and tended <b>to</b> increase <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> costal diaphragm and the parasternals. We conclude that (1) during quiet breathing, but not during inspiratory resistive loading, <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> costal diaphragm exceeded flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parasternal intercostals; (2) during quiet breathing, theophylline increased <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> expiratory muscles as it promoted recruitment of expiratory muscles; and (3) theophylline did not affect diaphragmatic blood flow for a given TTdi. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E

40|$|<b>Blood</b> flow <b>to</b> each uterine horn of cows {{during the}} oestrous cycle and early {{pregnancy}} was determined daily {{by use of}} electromagnetic blood flow probes placed around both middle uterine arteries. The pattern of <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> uteri of pregnant and non-pregnant cows was similar until Day 14 after mating or oestrus. Between Days 14 and 18 of pregnancy <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> uterine horn containing the conceptus increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) 2 - to 3 -fold, whereas <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> non-gravid uterine horn in these cows remained constant. No corresponding increase in <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> uterine horn ipsilateral <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ovary bearing the CL was observed in non-pregnant cows during this 4 -day period. By Day 19 of pregnancy, <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gravid uterine horn had returned to a level similar to that observed on Day 13. <b>Blood</b> flow <b>to</b> both uterine horns of pregnant cows remained constant from Days 19 to 25 and then increased <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gravid horn (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) markedly until Day 30 whereas <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> non-gravid horn remained low. Uterine blood flow during the oestrous cycle of non-pregnant cows was positively correlated (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) with systemic concentrations of oestradiol and the ratio of oestradiol (pg/ml) to progesterone (ng/ml). There was no association between oestradiol concentrations and <b>blood</b> flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gravid uterine horn. These data indicate local control of uterine blood flow by the bovine conceptus which may function to create optimal conditions for the continuation of pregnancy...|$|R

40|$|<b>Blood</b> {{perfusion}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> femoral head {{might be}} endangered during the surgical approach or {{the preparation of}} the femoral head or both in hip resurfacing arthroplasty. The contribution of <b>the</b> intramedullary <b>blood</b> supply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> femoral head in osteoarthritis is questionable. Therefore, the contribution of <b>the</b> extraosseous <b>blood</b> supply <b>to</b> osteoarthritic femoral heads was measured intraoperatively to question if there is measurable blood flow between the epiphysis and metaphysis in osteoarthritic hips in case of extraosseus vessel damage. At defined points during surgery we acquired the epiphyseal and metaphyseal femoral head perfusion by high-energy laser Doppler flowmetry. Complete femoral neck osteotomy sparing <b>the</b> retinacular vessels <b>to</b> simulate intraosseous <b>blood</b> disruption showed unchanged epiphyseal <b>blood</b> flow compared <b>to</b> initial measurement after capsulotomy. The pulsatile signal disappeared after transection of the retinacular vessels. Based on these acute measurements, we conclude intramedullary <b>blood</b> vessels <b>to</b> <b>the</b> femoral head do not provide measurable <b>blood</b> supply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> epiphysis once the medial femoral circumflex artery or the retinacular vessels have been damaged. We recommend the use of a safe surgical approach for hip resurfacing and careful implantation of <b>the</b> femoral component <b>to</b> respect <b>blood</b> supply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> femoral head and neck region in hip resurfacing arthroplasty...|$|R
5|$|Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction, the {{tightening of}} small {{blood vessels in}} the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension), which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle, the part of the heart that pumps <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lungs. The right ventricle undergoes remodeling, becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins. When this is the case, raised hydrostatic pressure leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and the abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} {{is caused}} by either a single instance of acute trauma to the knee, or repeated minor trauma to the knee. The trauma can cause extravasation of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates an inflammatory response. This response occurs in two phases: The vascular phase, in which the {{blood flow to the}} surrounding area increases, and the cellular phase, in which leukocytes migrate from the <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> affected area. Other possible causes include gout, sarcoidosis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, uremia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some cases are idiopathic, though these may be caused by trauma that the patient does not remember.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{functions}} as a pump in the circulatory system to provide a continuous flow of blood throughout the body. This circulation consists of the systemic circulation {{to and from the}} body and the pulmonary circulation to and from the lungs. Blood in the pulmonary circulation exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs through the process of respiration. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated <b>blood</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart for transfer to the lungs.|$|E
