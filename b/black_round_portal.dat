50|$|The {{church was}} built in 1270 {{adjacent}} to an Augustinian monastery located within the city walls. A century later it was refurbished, but still retains the side buttresses in elegant brick.

50|$|A {{church at}} the site was present by tenth century, but reconstructed in the 13th-century. The walls contain a mosaic of {{fragments}} from the earlier church. The façade {{is a mixture of}} white limestone and darker tan sandstones, formed by blocks of different size, with a <b>round</b> <b>portal</b> entrance. Above the entrance is a painted lunette. In 1817, the church became the home for the confraternity of carpenters.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} first {{mentioned}} {{as belonging to}} Frati Minori in 1289. The church with a bicolored (travertine marble and pietra serena) facade has a rose window in the center. The <b>rounded</b> <b>portal</b> is highly decorated with spiraling pilasters. The apse has a series of vaults with Gothic tracery. Nineteenth century restoration by Castellucci removed much of the plaster obscuring earlier frescoes, and altars that were shuttering windows.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] When {{a speaker}} {{stands in front}} of a {{projector}} screen for a presentation, the eyes will be hurt by the direct light from the digital projector. This paper proposes a design to reduce the strong light by projecting a <b>black</b> <b>round</b> mask on the speaker's head. The <b>black</b> <b>round</b> mask is superimposed to the slide frame by the software of this design and the mask traces the speaker’s head. The depth camera captures the depth images from the speaker with the projector screen. The location of the speaker’s head is determined by using the middleware components to process the depth images. This design efficiently continues to trace the head location. The computer uses this head location and superimposes a <b>black</b> <b>round</b> mask to reduce the uncomfortable feeling caused by the strong light of the projector. I...|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, the {{increase}} in population had surpassed the capacity of the small church, and construction of a new church was begun in 1890 {{under the direction of the}} engineer Zanovello, and completed ten years later. The design is eclectic, and includes a triumphal arch motif, a round oculus, and a <b>rounded</b> <b>portal,</b> all circumscribed by sleek lines recalling the new Stilo Liberty (art-nouveau) style. The apse has frescoes depicting the four evangelists.|$|R

50|$|A new station {{building}} was opened in 1884 {{on the north}} side of the platforms, but it was largely demolished in 2006. It was a brick building, designed by Johann Philipp Berdellé. The ground floor had Rundbogenstil <b>rounded</b> <b>portals</b> that continued into the windows of the lower eastern arcade. The main building had two storeys, with rectangular windows of bunter sandstone in a renaissance revival style. After the redesign and construction of commercial buildings at the station, only the listed facade of the old building has been preserved near the rail tracks. This facade has been integrated into the new building.|$|R
50|$|The Romanesque-style abbey church, {{built with}} local stone, has {{remained}} {{as a local}} oratory dedicated to the Virgin. It has a narrow nave leading to a flat apse wall with two narrow windows. The façade has a single high oculus with a <b>rounded</b> <b>portal.</b> The portal has an inscription from 1117, noting some repairs which appear to have reduced {{the size of the}} church. The apse and nave walls have fresco remnants from the 15th century, attributed respectively to Giovanni di Corraduccio and Matteo da Gualdo. The crypt remains relatively intact, supported by sturdy simple columns.|$|R
50|$|The stone façade of {{the church}} is simple but {{decorated}} in foliated reliefs on the <b>round</b> <b>portal.</b> The mullioned window above the portal has a mysterious dedication to R, S, A, Ω. The apse has columns with decoration with human and animal forms. Traces of frescoes from the 13th century exist. The church also once had a triptych depicting the Madonna and Child with Saints Francis, Peter, Paul, Augustine, and donors painted by Ventura del Moro, also known as Pseudo Ambrogio di Valdese. Stolen in 1979, after recovery it has been housed in the Museo Civico e Diocesano di Colle.|$|R
