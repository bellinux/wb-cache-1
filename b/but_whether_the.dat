She responded by reporting Headley to the U.S. embassy in Islamabad, and later submitting to interviews with State Department and ICE officials, describing his Mumbai activities at length. However, Outalha later admitted that she embellished some of her accusations against Headley, leading the Americans to not take her claims seriously. The State Department relayed her warnings to the DEA, the FBI, and the CIA, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> agencies acted on them is disputed.

25|$|The {{content and}} {{form of the}} salon to some extent defines the {{character}} and historical importance of the salon. Contemporary literature about the salons is dominated by idealistic notions of politesse, civilité and honnêteté, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> salons lived up to these standards is matter of debate. Older texts on the salons tend to paint an idealistic picture of the salons, where reasoned debate takes precedence and salons are egalitarian spheres of polite conversation. Today, however, this view is rarely considered an adequate analysis of the salon. Dena Goodman claims that rather than being leisure based or 'schools of civilité' salons were instead at 'the {{very heart of the}} philosophic community' and thus integral to the process of Enlightenment. In short, Goodman argues, the 17th and 18th century saw the emergence of the academic, Enlightenment salons, which came out of the aristocratic 'schools of civilité'. Politeness, argues Goodman, took second-place to academic discussion.|$|E
25|$|Gordon Wood argues Madison's {{frustrating}} {{experience in}} the Virginia legislature years earlier most shaped his constitutional views. Wood notes that the governmental structure in both the Virginia Plan and the final constitution were not innovative, since they were copied from the British government, {{had been used in}} the states since 1776, and numerous authors had already argued for their adoption at the national level. The controversial elements in the Virginia Plan were removed, and the rest was commonly accepted as necessary for a functional government (state or national) for decades, hence Madison's contribution was considered more qualitative. Wood argues that, like most national politicians of the late 1780s, Madison believed that the problem was less with the Articles of Confederation than with the nature of the state legislatures. He believed the solution was to restrain the excesses of the states. This required more than an alteration in the Articles of Confederation; it required a change in the character of the national compact. The ultimate question before the convention, Wood notes, was not how to design a government <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> states should remain sovereign, whether sovereignty should be transferred to the national government, or whether the constitution should settle somewhere in between.|$|E

500|$|The key {{holding of}} the Court was that, even if {{segregated}} {{black and white}} schools were of equal quality in facilities and teachers, segregation by itself was harmful to black students and unconstitutional. They found that a significant psychological and social disadvantage was given to black children from the nature of segregation itself, drawing on research conducted by Kenneth Clark assisted by June Shagaloff. This aspect was vital because the question was not whether the schools were [...] "equal", which under Plessy they nominally should have been, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> doctrine of separate was constitutional.

500|$|The medieval {{building}} was eventually abandoned, {{and much of}} the structural material was taken for reuse in Blakeney and Cley villages. A stone archway in Cley is traditionally believed to have come from the chapel, and would fit the western entrance, although it could have been brought from elsewhere such as the ruined Blakeney friary. The 'chapel' {{building was}} deserted around 1600, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> collapse of its east end was the cause or a consequence of its disuse is unknown. The main building seems to have suffered a major fire at some stage, and no wooden structures have been found. The site was flooded at least three times, subsequent to the building's collapse.

500|$|Meanwhile, {{the future}} of the symphony genre was coming into doubt. Musicologist Mark Evan Bonds writes, [...] "Even symphonies by [...] {{well-known}} composers of the early 19th century as Méhul, Rossini, Cherubini, Hérold, Czerny, Clementi, Weber and Moscheles were perceived in their own time as standing in the symphonic shadow of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, or some combination of the three." [...] While many composers continued to write symphonies during the 1820s and 30s, [...] "there was a growing sense that these works were aesthetically far inferior to Beethoven's.... The real question was not so much whether symphonies could still be written, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> genre could continue to flourish and grow as it had over the previous half-century in the hands of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. On this count, there were varying degrees of skepticism but virtually no real optimism." ...|$|E
500|$|Akshay Kumar {{played a}} fictitious gangster based on Dawood Ibrahim. Kumar's character's look was {{revealed}} on {{a reality show}} on Aapka Colors. Kumar's entrance on the show {{was supposed to be}} accompanied by music after a scene from the prequel (choreographed by director Milan Luthria), followed by an action sequence. The scene had a [...] "minor glitch", believed to be a failed attempt to sabotage Kumar's entrance. The scene was performed twice, taking a toll on Kumar's back and leading to the cancellation of a public appearance. The film would reportedly feature a scene with Kumar watching a cricket match, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> match was between India and Pakistan at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium during the 1980s was unconfirmed. The trailer premiered in Mumbai, where many of the film's outdoor scenes were shot. To promote the film, Kumar flew from New York (where he was on holiday with his family) to Birmingham to watch the India-Pakistan ICC Champions Trophy match on 15 June 2013 at Edgbaston Cricket Ground. A second trailer of the film was released on 3 July 2013, with narration by Kumar's character (Shoaib Khan), revealing plot details such as the rivalry between Kumar's and Imran Khan's characters for Jasmine's love. The trailer described Khan as the film's antihero, featuring action sequences between Shoaib Khan and Aslam (Imran Khan). Mohar Basu of Koimoi praised the second trailer, its background score, direction and action choreography, saying it [...] "is even better than the film's first trailer" [...] and has [...] "an explosive impact on its audiences".|$|E
