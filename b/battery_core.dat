40|$|A new approach, {{suitable}} for real-time implementation, is introduced for estimation of non-uniform internal temperature distribution in cylindrical lithium-ion cells. A radial 1 -D model {{is used to}} estimate the distribution using two inputs: the real or imaginary part of the electrochemical impedance of the cell at a single frequency, and the surface temperature. The approach does not require knowledge of cell thermal properties, heat generation or thermal boundary conditions. The model is validated experimentally, {{the first time for}} such an approach, using a cylindrical 26650 cell fitted with an internal thermocouple. The cell is heated by applying (1) current pulses of up to ± 20 A and (2) a 3500 s HEV drive cycle current profile, whilst monitoring the surface and core temperatures and measuring impedance at 215 Hz. During the drive cycle test, the <b>battery</b> <b>core</b> temperature increases by 20 °C and the surface temperature increases by 14 °C. The mean absolute error in the predicted maximum temperature throughout the cycle is 0. 6 °C (3 % of the total core temperature increase), in contrast to a mean absolute error of 2. 6 °C if the temperature is assumed to be uniform (13 % of the total core temperature increase). © 2014 Elsevier B.

30|$|As a used good, an EVB forms {{a complex}} {{system that can}} be traded as a whole, it can be {{disassembled}} into its components to be traded individually, {{or it can be}} integrated into and sold as a bigger system. The <b>battery’s</b> <b>core</b> component is the battery pack, consisting of several modules, each of which comprises battery cells (Klör et al. 2015 a; Saw et al. 2016). Connecting the cells and modules in parallel or in series allows adapting the pack to varying electric requirements of appliances. Additional components such as the battery management system (BMS), the thermal management system, and the casing also need to be tailored to the particular application. However, identifying the battery’s suitability for a particular second life application scenario demands information on the battery’s condition and its usage history, which strongly influence the battery’s expected performance and further degradation (Ahmadi et al. 2017; Rohr et al. 2017). Moreover, EVBs are classified as dangerous goods, which restrict their trading and processing and legally demand specific qualifications for their handling (UNECE 2016).

The Standard Battery includes Fluid (Rebus Learning, Logical Steps, Mystery Codes) and Crystallized (Definitions, Auditory Comprehension, Double Meaning) subtests; the Extended Battery includes an additional Fluid (Memory for Block Designs) and Crystallized (Famous Faces) subtest. Composite scores (M = 100, SD = 15) include: Crystallized, Fluid, and Composite. Study One derived and described a normative typology of KAIT core profiles.

Study Two used the item response theory likelihood ratio approach, based on a 2 -parameter logistic model, to investigate gender differential item functioning (DIF) in KAIT items. Subtest items examined for DIF included: Definitions, Auditory Comprehension, Double Meaning, Famous Faces, Mystery Codes, and Memory for Block Designs. Results indicated the presence of uniform (i,e., difficulty differences) and nonuniform (i. e., discrimination differences) DIF in several of the items in the Crystallized subtests. Study Three used multisample confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA) and latent means structures analysis (LMS) to test factorial invariance and latent mean differences across gender groups. MCFA found that the error variance of Famous Faces lacked invariance. LMS found that the intercepts of Memory for Block Designs, Famous Faces, Auditory Comprehension, and Logical Steps lacked invariance, with effect size estimates indicating that males obtained slightly higher expected scores than females. Consequently, latent mean differences were not conducted. As such, the KAIT demonstrated partial measurement invariance (Byrne, Shavelson, 2 ̆ 6 Múthen, 1989).

40|$|Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used non-human primate for research and testing in Europe. Their principal use is in preclinical safety testing of new pharmaceuticals to assess risk of adverse effects, as indicated by changes in a <b>core</b> <b>battery</b> of physiological measures before human exposure. Regulatory studies are strictly controlled through legislation and codes of practices underpinned by the principles of humane science, the 3 Rs; Replacement, Reduction and Refinement. Despite the link between good welfare and good science now universally made in codes of practice, legislation and the literature, there are few studies aimed at systematically examining the link and almost no quantitative data from cynomolgus macaques used for toxicology. The main aim of this thesis was to examine the link between Refinement, animal welfare and scientific output for this important animal model, piggy-backing on regulatory studies conducted by a large contract research organisation. In the laboratory, animal welfare is formally considered in terms of Refinement which has evolved to include both the reduction of negative welfare states and the proactive enhancement of positive welfare over the animal’s lifetime. A multidisciplinary approach to welfare assessment including measures of behaviour, physiology and physical health, and which built upon current unit procedures was undertaken to produce an overall assessment of welfare in cynomolgus macaques. Macaque facial expressions, vocalisations, activity and position in the home cage, body weight change, body condition and alopecia scores were found to be reliable indicators of welfare state and would be most feasible for care staff to monitor. The concept of quality of scientific output was defined in relation to toxicological findings and includes sensitivity, reliability and repeatability of individual measures in the <b>core</b> <b>battery</b> (e. g. heart rate, blood pressure, haematology, clinical chemistry and organ weights). The link between welfare and quality of scientific output was then systematically explored with Refinements to macaque use in regulatory studies. The first, a data mining study, undertaken to quantify the effects on biological data recorded from cynomolgus macaques, used in regulatory studies over an eight-year period as the CASE sponsor transitioned from single to permanent group housing, found the effects to be highly variable on individual parameters in the <b>core</b> <b>battery</b> and in some instances welfare-positive effects of group housing were confounded by concurrent changes in standard operating procedures. A further study of planned Refinements to macaque-care staff interaction through enhanced socialisation was found to help animals cope better with husbandry and scientific procedures and enhance quality of cardiovascular measures recorded at baseline. In light of these findings a number of recommendations are made including a framework of terms useful for measuring quality of scientific output, a welfare assessment framework and Refinements to husbandry and scientific procedures for cynomolgus macaques used in regulatory toxicology. Because of their capacity to suffer it is both ethically and scientifically important that macaque welfare is maximised and their use results in valid and reliable experimental outcomes informing on the safety and efficacy of new pharmaceuticals prior to human exposure...|$|R

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relationships between scores from the "Test of Professional Knowledge" of the NTE <b>Core</b> <b>Battery</b> (NTEPK) and selected variables of the Ball State University secondary education selective retention program. The selective retention criteria included: scores from the "Ball State University Professional Knowledge Test" (BSUPK), College Board Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores, grade-point averages from courses in the professional education sequence, and overall college grade-point averages. Additional factors considered were sex, high school class rank, non-traditional student status, class, and age. The study was conducted at Teachers College, Ball State University, during the 1984 - 1985 academic year. A three part testing program conducted by the Office of Secondary Teacher Education produced two sets of test scores which were the major data of the study. The tests producing the scores were the NTEPK and the BSUPK. Participating in the study were 114 secondary, all-grade or junior high/middle school education students. Twelve null hypotheses were tested. Nine of these were tested by Pearson product-moment correlations. Two null hypotheses were tested using a 2 x 2 multivariate analysis of variance and one null hypothesis was tested using multiple regression correlations stepwise and backward. Significant correlations were found between the dependent variable NTEPK and each of the following: BSUPK scores, SAT-Verbal, SAT-Mathematics, SAT-Combined scores, college grade-point averages, professional sequence grade-point averages, and high school class rank. Non-traditional students' scores on the NTEPK did not correlate significantly with their BSUPK scores.

5000|$|It is {{recommended}} that practitioners adhere to several guiding principles {{in order to ensure}} that XBA procedures are psychometrically and theoretically sound. [...] First, one should select an intelligence battery that best addresses referral concerns. Second, subtests and clusters or composites from a single battery should be utilized whenever possible in order to best represent the broad CHC abilities (i.e., use actual norms whenever possible). Third, it is important to construct CHC broad and narrow ability clusters through acceptable methods, such as CHC theory driven factor analyses or expert consensus content-validity studies. [...] Fourth, when two or more qualitatively different indicators of a broad abilities of interest are not assessed or available on the <b>core</b> <b>battery,</b> then one may supplement it for broad ability indicators from another battery. Finally, when crossing batteries, select tests that were developed and normed within a few years of one another. Sixth, in order to minimize the effect of spurious differences between test scores, select tests from the smallest number of batteries.Underlining the importance of the above points of consideration is the fact that the overzealous attitude of few psychologists to use this XBA approach has led to several cases of its abuse resulting in wrong and misguiding results.|$|R
50|$|The second race {{started at}} 13:00 local time. Weather {{conditions}} {{at the start of}} the race were dry and sunny with an air temperature between 83.5 to 85.1 F and a track temperature ranging from 83.03 to 84.02 F. Six more laps were completed by the drivers in the event, making <b>battery</b> management the <b>core</b> concern of all participants. For the second consecutive day, it was not the pole sitter who got away in the lead as Rosenqvist accelerated faster than Bird off the line and was ahead of him driving into the turn one hairpin. Gasly fell to fifth behind Heidfeld. Just as in the first race, several drivers made contact in the first turn. Abt's rear wheel guard was damaged from contact with teammate di Grassi and Dillmann. Engel ploughed into the rear-end of Vergne in the first corner, and the driver was shown a black flag with a orange circle, requiring him to enter the pit lane for repairs. Abt slowed halfway through the first lap, stopping in the centre of the track to perform a full reset, and fell to the rear of the field. Prost made the best getaway in the field, gaining three positions by the end of the first lap, while Abt's problems meant he lost 12 places over the same distance.|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate the percentage of examinees who pass National Teacher Evaluation (NTE) tests because many users of the tests require that examinees pass different combinations of tests or use different passing scores {{for each of the}} tests. This study first develops a taxonomy of state NTE requirements and then computes passing rates for each rype of state requirement for both the examinee group impacted by the requirement and for each self-identified ethnic group. An example is the situation in which states require teacher certification candidates to pass all three <b>Core</b> <b>Battery</b> tests and the Specialty Area test most relevant to their own area of interest. For this type of requirement, the percentage of examinees who pass each test is computed, as well as the percentage of examinees who pass all the required tests. Results show considerable variation in passing rates depending on types of requirement and passing scores, and they demonstrate variation in ethnic differences on passing rates. For blacks, the ratio of examinees to white examinees who pass each requirement is related to the passing scores used and the required tests. Appendix A contains a model to discuss impact on reducing cutoff scores, and Appendix B lists the NTE Specialty Area tests.
