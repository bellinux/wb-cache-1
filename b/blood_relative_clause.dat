40|$|This {{paper has}} two goals. In the first half，this paper will re-define <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> of {{different}} kinds of languages，with emphasis on Hawaiian. Although <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> in other languages have similarity to English, the indentification of the <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> in other languages is not consistent because of variation in syntax. This paper will propose a definition of the <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> which can be used regardless of the variation in syntax. The revised definition will consist of two parts:(1) a <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> has a structure of one of possible predicate types in that particular language，and (2) a noun modified by a <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> corresponds to an element inside of the <b>relative</b> <b>clause.</b> The above definition makes it possible to generalize <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> in different kinds of languages. In the second half，this paper will analyze <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> in Hawaiian，using the above definition.

40|$|For several languages, a {{preference}} for subject <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> over object <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> has been reported. However, Mak, Vonk, and Schriefers (2002) showed {{that there is no}} such preference for <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> with an animate subject and an inanimate object. A Dutch object <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> as …de rots, die de wandelaars beklommen hebben… (‘the rock, that the hikers climbed’) did not show longer reading times than its subject <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> counterpart …de wandelaars, die de rots beklommen hebben… (‘the hikers, who climbed the rock’). In the present paper, we explore the factors that might contribute to this modulation of the usual preference for subject <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b> Experiment 1 shows that the animacy of the antecedent per se is not the decisive factor. On the contrary, in <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> with an inanimate antecedent and an inanimate relative-clause-internal noun phrase, the usual preference for subject <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> is found. In Experiments 2 and 3, subject and object <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> were contrasted in which either the subject or the object was inanimate. The results are interpreted in a framework in which the choice for an analysis of the <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> is based on the interplay of animacy with topichood and verb semantics. This framework accounts for the commonly reported preference for subject <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> over object <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> as well as for the pattern of data found in the present experiments...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{in several}} {{languages}} {{have shown that}} subject-relative clauses are easier to process than object-relative clauses. Mak, Vonk, and Schriefers (2006) have proposed the topichood hypothesis {{to account for the}} preference for subject-relative clauses. This hypothesis claims that the entity in the <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> that is most topicworthy will be chosen as the subject. By default, the antecedent of the <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> will be chosen as the subject of the <b>relative</b> <b>clause,</b> because it is the topic of the <b>relative</b> <b>clause.</b> However, when the noun phrase (NP) in the <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> is also topicworthy, the preference for the antecedent to be the subject will disappear. This was confirmed in two experiments. In Experiment 1, we tested <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> with a personal pronoun in the <b>relative</b> <b>clause.</b> We obtained a preference for object-relative clauses, in line with the assumption that personal pronouns refer to a discourse topic and are thus topicworthy. In Experiment 2, the discourse status of the NP in the <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> was manipulated: either it was not present in the preceding context, or it was the discourse topic. The experiment showed that when the NP in the <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> refers to the discourse topic, the difficulty of object-relative clauses is reduced, in comparison with <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> with an NP that is new in the discourse, {{even in the absence of}} any explicit cue in the <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> itself.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} comprehensive {{account of the}} grammar of <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> extraposition in English. Based on a systematic review and evaluation of the empirical generalizations and theoretical approaches provided {{in the literature on}} generative grammar, it is shown that none of the previous theories is able to account for all the relevant facts. Among the most problematic data are the Principle C and scope effects of <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> extraposition, cases with obligatory <b>relative</b> <b>clauses,</b> and <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> with elliptical NPs as antecedents. I propose a new analysis of <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> extraposition within the constraint-based, monostratal grammatical framework of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), enhanced with the semantic theory of Lexical Resource Semantics (LRS). Crucially, it is a general analysis of <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> attachment, since both canonical and extraposed <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> are licensed by the same syntactic and semantic constraints. The basic assumption is that a <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> can be adjoined to any phrase that contains a suitable antecedent of the relative pronoun. The semantic information that licenses the <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> is introduced by the determiner of the antecedent NP. The techniques of underspecified semantics and the standard semantic representation language used by LRS make it possible to formulate constraints which yield the correct intersective interpretation of the <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> (arbitrarily distant from its antecedent NP) {{and at the same time}} link the scope of the antecedent NP to the adjunction site of the <b>relative</b> <b>clause.</b> In combination with the revised HPSG binding theory developed in this dissertation, the proposed analysis is able to capture the major properties of <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> attachment within a unified and internally consistent monostratal constraint-based grammatical framework...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 50 - 51) This thesis {{discusses the}} similarities and differences between Korean and English <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> on the basis of Ross???s NP-S analysis of <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b> Korean and English are unrelated languages. Korean is a SOV language whereas English is a SVO language. Thus, the order of English <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> constituent structure is S-NP in Korean. Most previous contrastive studies of <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> in Korean and English were confined to superficial differences and problem points. This study broadens the scope of investigation and includes an explanation for most syntactic distinctions between Korean and English <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b> Although on the surface, Korean clausal modifiers lack relative pronouns, their underlying structures share similarities with English <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b> Both languages produce <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> by embedding the subordinate sentences into head NP's. The language specific transformational rules in <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> formation for English are Pronominalization, Relative Pronoun Deletion, Modifier Shifting.
