5000|$|Many newer cars {{no longer}} offer {{voltmeters}} or ammeters; instead, these vehicles typically have a light with {{the outline of}} an automotive battery on it. This can be somewhat misleading {{as it may be}} confused for an indicator of a <b>bad</b> <b>battery</b> when in reality it indicates a problem with the vehicle's charging system.|$|E
25|$|Craven, {{who was the}} Chief Scientist of the Navy's Special Projects Office, {{which had}} {{management}} responsibility for the design, development, construction, operational test and evaluation and maintenance of the UGM-27 Polaris Fleet Missile System had long believed Scorpion was struck by her own torpedo, but revised his views during the mid-1990s {{when he learned that}} engineers testing Mark 46 batteries at Keyport, Washington just before the Scorpion's loss, said the batteries leaked electrolyte and sometimes burned while outside their casings during lifetime shock, heat and cold testing. Although the battery manufacturer was accused of building <b>bad</b> <b>batteries,</b> it was later able to successfully prove its batteries were no more prone to failure than those made by other manufacturers.|$|R

50|$|On the British {{motoring}} show Top Gear, {{presented by}} Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond on BBC, the G-Wiz (as REVAi {{is known in}} the UK) has been the object of much ridicule. Top Gear has on several instances, tried to destroy the G-Wiz, or make fun of it by stating their opinion that the G-Wiz has a <b>bad</b> <b>battery</b> life, poor acceleration, overall design, and safety.|$|E
40|$|Planned {{obsolescence}} {{has recently}} been a common allegation to manufacturers, but proof apart from isolated cases is missing. This paper analyses the situation for smartphones, looks at use- and lifetime of smartphones and the underlying reasons for their obsolescence. Surveys show {{that a majority of}} consumers believes in "planned obsolescence" as a fact on the market and would like to have more durable products. Regarding smartphones, broken screens and <b>bad</b> <b>battery</b> performance are often reported problems. At the same time, most phones are still functioning when being replaced after the average use time of two years. How do these two aspects combine? Short product cycles, new functionalities and features trigger replacement purchases (functional and psychological obsolescence) more strongly than broken devices. Necessary repair of products is expensive due to miniaturized product design, glued in batteries, and the limited availability of replacement parts (economical obsolescence). Besides, buying new products is often subsidized by provider contracts...|$|E
