5|$|A {{conflict}} arose with Paramount {{over the}} film's budget. Foster had thirty days {{to set up}} a new deal with another studio, or Paramount would own the exclusive rights. He was inundated with offers and accepted one from First Artists Group, because McQueen would receive no upfront salary, just 10% of the gross receipts from the first dollar taken in on the film.

5|$|Hale–Bopp became {{visible to}} the naked eye in May 1996, and {{although}} its rate of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year, scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would <b>become</b> <b>very</b> bright. It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|Its great {{distance}} and surprising activity indicated that comet Hale–Bopp might <b>become</b> <b>very</b> bright indeed when it reached perihelion in 1997. However, comet scientists were wary – comets {{can be extremely}} unpredictable, and many have large outbursts at {{great distance}} only to diminish in brightness later.

5|$|The {{agriculture}} of {{the parish}} is chiefly confined to grazing, and would be more materially benefited by draining; but the tax upon brick, a most essential article in this process, {{has been a very}} great hindrance to it.

Without adequate exercise, a Welsh Springer Spaniel may appear hyperactive. Some Welsh Springers can become clingy towards their owners and suffer separation anxiety when alone.|$|E

The yucca provides a place for the moth to lay its eggs, deep within the flower away from potential predators.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1990s, {{the breed}} was almost unknown outside of Russia, and so {{relatively}} few details on associated health issues are known. The Russian Toy was originally bred as a rat fighter {{and as a}} watchdog, and can still exhibit the vocalization expected from the latter. It is a friendly dog and can <b>become</b> <b>very</b> attached to the family unit. Due to its size and similarities to the chihuahua, the two are often compared.|$|E

His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house gradually became dilapidated before falling down.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1990 season, Parcells, {{with whom}} Taylor had <b>become</b> <b>very</b> close, retired, {{and the team}} {{was taken over by}} Ray Handley. 1991 marked a steep decline in Taylor's production.

Taylor {{finished}} with 7 sacks in 14 games and the Giants defense, while still respectable, was no longer one of the top units in the league.|$|E
