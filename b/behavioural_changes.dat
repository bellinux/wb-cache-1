5|$|A {{strain of}} truly domesticated red foxes was {{introduced}} by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.|$|E
5|$|Birds need {{to alter}} their {{metabolism}} {{to meet the demands}} of migration. The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be moulted. The timing of this moult – usually once a year but sometimes twice – varies with some species moulting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory that}} Henry {{suffered}} from syphilis has been dismissed by most historians. Historian Susan Maclean Kybett ascribes his demise to scurvy, {{which is caused}} by a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables. Alternatively, his wives' pattern of pregnancies and his mental deterioration have led some to suggest that the king may have been Kell positive and suffered from McLeod syndrome. According to another study, Henry VIII's history and body morphology may have been the result of traumatic brain injury after his 1536 jousting accident, which in turn led to a neuroendocrine cause of his obesity. This analysis identifies growth hormone deficiency (GHD) as the source for his increased adiposity but also significant <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> noted in his later years, including his multiple marriages.|$|E

For example, the understanding that deviant behaviour like stealing may be learned behaviour resulting from reinforcers like hunger satisfaction that are unrelated to criminal behaviour can aid the development of social controls that address this underlying issue rather than merely the resultant behaviour.|$|R
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may {{be followed by a}} tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day. In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E

However, her behavioural problems continued and she was suspended from school multiple times in the fall of 2002. In March 2003, after multiple court appearances, Smith was admitted to the Pierre Caissie Centre for assessment. She was diagnosed with ADHD, learning disorder, borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality traits. She was discharged several days early from the Centre for unruly and disruptive behaviour and returned to the New Brunswick Youth Centre (NBYC).

In social isolation models, pups which are placed in separate cages after being weaned show <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> as adults and altered neural development. These changes remain after being re-introduced into the colony in adulthood.

25|$|Symptoms are {{not seen}} {{immediately}} in cattle {{due to the}} diseases’ extremely long incubation period. Some cattle have been observed to have an abnormal gait, changes in behavior, tremors and hyper-responsiveness to certain stimuli. Hindlimb ataxia affects the animal’s gait and occurs when muscle control is lost. This results in poor balance and coordination. <b>Behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> may include aggression, anxiety relating to certain situations, nervousness, frenzy or an overall change in temperament. Some rare but previously observed symptoms also include persistent pacing, rubbing or licking. Additionally, nonspecific symptoms have also been observed which include weight loss, decreased milk production, lameness, ear infections and teeth grinding due to pain. Some animals may show {{a combination of these}} symptoms, while others may only be observed demonstrating one of the many reported. Once clinical symptoms arise, they typically get worse over the upcoming weeks and months, eventually leading to recumbency, coma and death.|$|E

The European environmental Agency, as well as the national resource plans, emphasise that it is through <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> of the citizens that the big resources reductions will happen, and that this can be achieved via <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> initiatives This thesis seeks to contribute to the pool of knowledge about how <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> initiatives though campaign planning, can contribute to an increased recycling rate.

25|$|There are however, some {{actions of}} prey species are clearly {{directed}} to actual or potential predators. A {{good example is}} warning colouration: species such as wasps {{that are capable of}} harming potential predators are often brightly coloured, and this modifies the behaviour of the predator, who either instinctively or as the result of experience will avoid attacking such an animal. Some forms of mimicry fall in the same category: for example hoverflies are coloured {{in the same way as}} wasps, and although they are unable to sting, the strong avoidance of wasps by predators gives the hoverfly some protection. There are also <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> that act in a similar way to warning colouration. For example, canines such as wolves and coyotes may adopt an aggressive posture, such as growling with their teeth bared, to indicate they will fight if necessary, and rattlesnakes use their well-known rattle to warn potential predators of their venomous bite. Sometimes, a behavioural change and warning colouration will be combined, as in certain species of amphibians which have most of their body coloured to blend with their surroundings, except for a brightly coloured belly. When confronted with a potential threat, they show their belly, indicating that they are poisonous in some way.|$|E

Sex tourism is also popular in Thailand, where male sex workers are more at risk to HIV threats than their female counterparts. Social marketing campaigns have been useful in addressing several problematic behaviours, such as smoking, binge drinking, unprotected sex and unhealthy dietary practices. Hence, {{the main purpose of}} this research study is to propose a conceptual framework for promoting safe sex practices to male sex workers in Thailand. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) has been generally applied to help understand and examine <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> intentions, and develop <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> initiatives. TPB attempts to identify the psychological determinants of <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> intention in a single point of time. However, it does not show how <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> occurs as a process, or at various stages. As this theory is not adequate for understanding the entire process of <b>behavioural</b> <b>change,</b> a more comprehensive theoretical framework is required. Combining the Theory of Planned Behaviour with the Stages of Change Theory (SCT) provides a highly comprehensive theoretical framework. The Stages of Change Theory is used in the social marketing field to facilitate <b>behavioural</b> <b>change.</b> SCT shows the behaviour change as a process. The implications of this new framework for both theory and practice are discussed, as well as the directions for future research, which would be of use to researchers and practitioners in the social marketing field.

2500|$|As {{the frontal}} lobes {{had been the}} object of {{scientific}} inquiry and speculation since the late 19th century, Fulton's contribution, while it may have functioned as source of intellectual support, is of itself unnecessary and inadequate as an explanation of Moniz's resolution to operate on {{this section of the}} brain. Under an evolutionary and hierarchical model of brain development it had been hypothesized that those regions associated with more recent development, such as the mammalian brain and, most especially, the frontal lobes, were responsible for more complex cognitive functions. However, this theoretical formulation found little laboratory support, as 19th century experimentation found no significant change in animal behaviour following surgical removal or electrical stimulation of the frontal lobes. This picture of the so-called [...] "silent lobe" [...] changed in the period after World War I with the production of clinical reports of ex-servicemen who had suffered brain trauma. The refinement of neurosurgical techniques also facilitated increasing attempts to remove brain tumours, treat focal epilepsy in humans and led to more precise experimental neurosurgery in animal studies. Cases were reported where mental symptoms were alleviated following the surgical removal of diseased or damaged brain tissue. The accumulation of medical case studies on <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> following damage to the frontal lobes led to the formulation of the concept of Witzelsucht, which designated a neurological condition characterised by a certain hilarity and childishness in the afflicted. The picture of frontal lobe function that emerged from these studies was complicated by the observation that neurological deficits attendant on damage to a single lobe might be compensated for if the opposite lobe remained intact. In 1922, the Italian neurologist Leonardo Bianchi published a detailed report on the results of bilateral lobectomies in animals that supported the contention that the frontal lobes were both integral to intellectual function and that their removal led to the disintegration of the subject's personality. This work, while influential, was not without its critics due to deficiencies in experimental design.|$|E

40|$|Integrated {{marketing}} communication (IMC) {{is a concept}} which has been explored in commercial contexts by numerous studies. Numerous scholars in the literature highlight the benefits of adopting an IMC approach which creates message consistency, amongst others. However, there is still limited literature on the adoption and use of IMC {{in the context of}} non-profit organisations involved in social marketing campaigns to support their <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> messages. Insight into the adoption and use of an IMC approach could be useful to non-profit organisations involved in social marketing as it could increase the success of <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> messages. This study aims to explore the use of IMC by one non-profit organisation within a social marketing context. By doing so the study proposes and refines IMC criteria for social marketing to support <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> messages and thus contributes to the existing body of knowledge on using IMC in social marketing. The study uses a single case study approach which includes using three data collection methods to collect data from the South Africa National Blood Service (SANBS) to evaluate its social marketing campaigns according to proposed IMC criteria for social marketing.

The measures, consisting of trestles, bricklaying scaffolds, mast-climbing work platforms and cranes, reduce the physical work demands made upon bricklayers and bricklayers' assistants. Structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders of 27 companies. Ordinal regression of <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> phases on the use of ergonomic measures showed a significant increase in both ABP and SBP in relation to increased use of three of the four ergonomic measures (i. e. trestles, bricklaying scaffolds, mast-climbing work platforms) by employers/planners and increased use of one ergonomic measure (i. e. trestles) by foremen/bricklayers. In conclusion, the positive and significant associations between the completed <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> phases (ABP and SBP) and use of ergonomic measures differ for the stakeholder groups and between the ergonomic measures. The data suggest that there is a higher chance of increasing the use of ergonomic measures by means of a higher ABP than a higher SBP.

40|$|Over recent years, {{designing}} {{technologies to}} promote health-related <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> {{has been an}} area of growing interest in HCI. Given the prevalence of self-monitoring and social facilitation in emerging designs, the assumption appears to be that increasing an individual’s awareness {{of his or her}} behaviour and the behaviour of others will promote <b>behavioural</b> <b>change.</b> This thesis argues that while this is true to some extent, this represents a somewhat naive view of how individuals come to make decisions regarding their health-related behaviours. Three qualitative studies within distinct health domains illustrate the complex nature of health-related <b>behavioural</b> <b>change.</b> Weight Management was an inherently social activity, albeit subject to selective disclosure and incremental participation. Individuals were generally motivated by appearance rather than health, implementing change based on exposure and orientation to alternative strategies. In Families at Risk, caregivers were highly motivated by a desire to safeguard the health of their children but were restricted by a lack of financial and strategic resources. Lack of trust and a transient community contributed to social isolation, thus inhibiting opportunities for collaboration. In Cardiac Rehabilitation, <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> efforts were prompted by an acute health crisis and guided by health professionals. However, <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> efforts were sometimes restricted by a desire to return to normal, tensions arising when what was considered normal was composed of risk behaviours. Family involvement varied greatly, ranging from disregard to facilitating change, and a desire for independence and ownership of the rehabilitation sometimes restricted the active involvement of peers. Informed by the findings of these studies this thesis highlights the strengths and limitations of current technological approaches to promoting <b>behavioural</b> <b>change,</b> provides implications for design, and supported by the sociomedical literature, identifies alternative avenues of technological innovation. The thesis reflects on technology’s role in health-related <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> and considers associated ethical implications. Overall, the main contribution of this thesis is a reframing of the problem of promoting health-related <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> as more than a matter of behavioural awareness and personal motivation. While it is understandable that technologists would look to the clinical domain to inform initial investigations in this area, this thesis argues that technologists should be cautious about blindly adopting its prescriptive paradigm. As an alternative to persuasion, this thesis offers negotiation as a potential model for future innovations in this area. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
