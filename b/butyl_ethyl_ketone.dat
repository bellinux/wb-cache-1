40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, the {{airborne}} concentrations of analytes of occupa-tional health significance for workers engaged in commercial-scale processing of polyethylene were measured. Eight polyethylene resins, selected primarily from those produced using an advanced solution-phase process, were extruded under commercial-scale processing conditions appropriate to their application: blown and cast film; and blow-, injection-, and rotational-molding. Air samples {{were taken from}} operator breathing zones and representative workplace air using recognized {{occupational health and safety}} protocols. The compounds selected consisted of aldehydes (acetaldehyde, acrolein, crotonaldehyde, formaldehyde, n-valeraldehyde), <b>ketones</b> (acetone, methyl <b>ethyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> THF, methyl n-amyl <b>ketone,</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> ketene), organic acids (acetic, formic, and propanoic), aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylenes), and other compounds (nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ethylene oxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, paraffin wax fume). Of the 488 concentrations measured from operator breathing zones and workplace air, 466 were below sampling method detection limits. Twelve of the remaining 22 concentrations were less than 20 % of the established exposure limits, and were therefore considered to present a statistically insignificant exposure risk. Five of the remaining 10 measurements consisted of ketene concentrations, which were found to be below detection limits upon retesting. The other five concentrations, of ozone, were also retested and found to be below detection limits. It is concluded that commercial-scale polyethylene extrusion presents minimal inhalation hazards in an adequately ventilated workplace.

A potential approach for conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals is to combine biochemical and chemical processes. This research used microbial fermentation to produce 2, 3 -butanediol, which was then converted to methyl <b>ethyl</b> <b>ketone</b> by dehydration over a solid acid catalyst. The fermentation process was performed using the bacteria Klebsiella oxytoca (K.

Auto-ignition {{temperature}} (AIT) {{is usually}} {{defined as the}} lowest temperature at which a substance will produce hot-flame ignition in air at atmospheric pressure {{without the aid of}} an external energy source such as spark or flame. Its principal applications include: defining the maximum acceptable surface temperature in a particular area, usually for electrical classification purpose, to prevent fire and explosion hazards; determining the possible hazardous consequence associated with leakage of flammable chemicals in risk assessment methods. Although AIT is indispensable for safely handling and operating flammable substance, the AITs data are, however, very much diverse in different data compilations. In present work the AITs of three ketones are measured in compliance with the ASTM E 659 test method.
