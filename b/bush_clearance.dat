Although the risk of infection from a tsetse fly bite is minor (estimated at less than 0.1%), the use of insect repellants, wearing long-sleeved clothing, avoiding tsetse-dense areas, implementing <b>bush</b> <b>clearance</b> methods and wild game culling are the best options to avoid infection available for local residents of affected areas.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Within the savannas of the {{southern}} Kalahari, land use practices can change habitat structure profoundly, so that rangelands either became densely wooden through bush thickening or are cleared completely using arboricides or manual tree felling and <b>bush</b> <b>clearance,</b> or are at some stage in between. Demands for the wood of camelthorn trees (Acacia reioloba), (the largest tree species growing on semi-arid and arid Kalahari sands) for firewood has also impacted habitat structure. Large trees are important in the Kalahari ecosystem because they provide shade, nesting and foraging sites for birds and mammals, as well as microhabitats that facilitate {{the existence of a}} suite of subcanopy plants. Indeed, large A. erioloba tress have been mooted as a context-depend keystones species, important to other biota and ecological prcesess.

40|$|Reproductive performance, mortality, growth, and culling and {{replacement}} rates based on 20000 calving records were evaluated for grade Boran beef cattle maintained with trypanosomiasis risk in Tanzania. Under ranching conditions, over a 10 -year period {{in this area}} of high Glossina moistens morsitans, G. and G. brevipalpis challenge, a calving interval of 15. 9 months, pre-weaning mortality of 8 %, annual cow mortality of 5. 8 % and 8 -month weaning weight of 133. 5 kg resulted in a herd productivity of 96 kg of weaner calf per cow per year. The proportion of heifers required as replacements (45 %) and the generation interval (6. 9 years) indicated scope for implementation of selection programmes on growth traits. The level of productivity achieved compared favourably with major data sets recently analysed from pure Boran cattle under trypanosomiasis-free ranching conditions in Kenya, and from trypanotolerant N'Dama cattle in West Africa. These results indicate the possibility of improving livestock production in tsetse-infested areas by the rational use of chemoprophylaxis {{as an integral part of}} management. Year, season, cow age, calf sex and location on ranch had significant effects on practically all the traits of calving interval, pre-weaning mortality and growth, and cow productivity. Superior performance where <b>bush</b> <b>clearance</b> and tsetse fly control had taken place suggests that economic evaluation of these interventions should be attempted. The season of calving had a major effect on productivity. Cows of 5 - 8 years of age were the most productive, as were animals producing male calves, features well recognized in beef cattle production. An average of 4. 4 treatments with Samorin, a prophylactic, and 0. 6 treatments with Berenil, a therapeutic, were required per year. The number of treatments varied from year to year and by area, being greater in the south of the ranch where the tsetse challenge was considered higher. However, the age and season of calving had little effect on the number of treatments required. Despite such extensive use of trypanocidal drugs, there was no indication that drug resistance had developed or evidence that repeated inoculation of Samorin had affected productivity. Grading-up of small East African Zebu cattle to Boran over an 8 -year period allowed annual comparison of birth weight, pre-weaning growth and weaning weights of two groups of calves, one having a higher level of Boran genes (varying from 12 to 60 % higher annually) than the other. Those with the higher level of Boran genes performed better by 3. 3 % for all attributes studied, but as the percentage difference in Boran genes decreased, so did this difference. In an environment improved through <b>bush</b> <b>clearance</b> and tsetse fly control, the calves with higher levels of Boran genes were superior, but this superiority was not expressed in the unimproved environment...|$|E
40|$|Motu Kaikoura (Kaikoura Island) is a 535 ha {{island off}} the coast of Great Barrier Island, North Island, NewZealand. The island was {{purchased}} by the Crown in 2004 as a reserve. The island has been heavily modified by farming, fires, <b>bush</b> <b>clearances</b> and the impacts of exotic mammals such as fallow deer (Dama dama), ship rats (Rattus rattus) and cats (Felis catus). The vegetation of the island is now dominated by tea tree (Kunzea and Leptospermum), small patches of broadleaf forest and bare rocky areas (Cameron 2007). A number of vegetation surveys since 2006 recorded a total of 381 species of higher plants (68 % native), but bryophytes were not systematically studied (Cameron 2007), and lichens and fungi were not studied at all.

40|$|PhDClearances at {{connections}} {{of mechanical}} systems may allow contact to be momentarily lost between the interconnected elements resulting in impact loading, {{the generation of}} noise and deterioration of the bearing surfaces. The work presented examines the dynamic behaviour of a planar mechanism having clearances-at two of its bearings and suggests criteria which may be applied {{at the design stage}} to ensure that contact loss does not occur. A test rig has been developed having both rotary and oscillatory inputs and operable as a single input 4 /bar ljnkage or a double input 5 /bar linkage mechanism. The rotary input is varied between 170 and 370 rev/min and the oscillatory input between 10 and 22 Hz at amplitudes of 1. 8 and 2. 6 mm. Acceleration impact levels are measured by means of small accelerometers embedded in the bearing housing. The bearings are nominally 25 mm diameter steel pins with sintered bronze <b>bushes.</b> <b>Clearances</b> in the range of 15 to 105 gm are examined. An-additional dynamic constraint to the system is provided by spring loading one of the links. The series of tests performed establish various conditions at which impact loading occurs. A mathematical model of the test rig is developed, the equations of motion being solved numerically. Following some earlier work a zero-clearance analysis of the system has been used to develop empirical relationships for describing the occurrence and magnitude of the impact loading. These relationships are applicable to the system when only one bearing has a finite clearance and when two bearings have finite clearances. The interactive effects of a two clearance bearing system are examined in detail and it is concluded that the empirical relationships developed may be generally applied...|$|R

40|$|One of {{series of}} seven working papers {{considering}} {{the political economy}} of One HealthAfrican trypanosomiasis is a devastating disease, both for humans and animals. Over the last hundred years huge efforts have been made to control it. This paper explores the scientific and policy debates surrounding the control of the disease and its vector, the tsetse fly. The paper focuses particularly on East and Southern Africa, and so the savanna tsetse flies and Trypanosomiasis brucei rhodesiense. Based on an extensive review of documentary material, combined with a series of interviews with scientists and policymakers, the paper offers an assessment of the changing institutional politics associated with tsetse and trypanosomiasis control. The paper investigates in particular the controversies surrounding a range of control methods, including <b>bush</b> <b>clearance,</b> game culling, baits and traps, sterile insect release, animal breeding, drugs and vaccines, among others. The focus on particular control methods has meant that alternatives have often been overlooked, and the perspectives of livestock keepers living with the disease have not taken into account. In addition, competition for dwindling research and operational funds, combined with a lack of institutional coordination, has resulted in the failure to develop an integrated approach; one that links ecological and disease dynamics with socio-economic conditions. The conclusion discusses why such a ‘One Health’ approach is required, and why addressing the politics of science and policy is essential. Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{commentary}} by the Commissioner on Environment Aotearoa 2015 – {{the state of}} the environment report published last year by the Ministry for the Environment and Statistics New Zealand. The Commissioner’s commentary begins with a review of that report. It then presents the Commissioner’s take on the state of New Zealand’s environment and identifies priority issues that stand out for particular attention. The report concludes that air quality is generally good in most places most of the time. Water quality is very good in undeveloped parts of the country, but is poor in many catchments. Much of this is a consequence of historic <b>bush</b> <b>clearance</b> on unstable soils and increasingly intensive farming. Lakes and estuaries are particularly vulnerable. Our native plants and animals are in serious trouble with most of our iconic bird species in decline. When it comes to the state of our ocean, we simply do not know very much. We do, however, know that climate change {{is by far the most}} worrying environmental issue. Already, global temperatures are increasing, the surface waters of the ocean are acidifying, and the level of the sea is rising. Six recommendations are made. The first five recommendations are to the Government Statistician and the Secretary for the Environment, and follow from the assessment of Environment Aotearoa 2015 in Chapter 2. Each identifies an aspect for improvement in future state of the environment reports.  The last recommendation is to the Secretary for the Environment and seeks a response to the findings of Environment Aotearoa 2015 and this commentary...|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{the twentieth}} century the idea that areas of human {{settlement}} should be kept separate from areas of wilderness has shaped the evolution of both conservation and disease control strategies in Africa. This article focuses {{on the history of}} evolving approaches to the tsetse fly in Africa, and its associated diseases, by considering the experience of the kingdom of Bunyoro in Uganda in the late precolonial and colonial periods. The evidence from Bunyoro provides some support for the thesis developed by John Ford in his seminal 1971 study, The Role of the African Trypanosomiases in African Ecology, that communities in precolonial Africa adopted interventionist strategies of local environmental management such as <b>bush</b> <b>clearance,</b> fire, grazing, and hunting {{in order to try to}} control the tsetse fly. The example of Bunyoro strongly reinforces Ford’s argument that such techniques required relatively high levels of human and livestock population density and stability to operate successfully. The colonial period (1900 – 62) was associated with environmental problems in Bunyoro in large part because human and stock populations fell so drastically from the 1890 s to the 1930 s. The focus in this article, however, will be on three other, sometimes conflicting, characteristics of colonial policy that tended to produce negative environmental outcomes not only in Bunyoro, but to varying degrees across the European empires. First, colonial environmental interventions consistently tried to remove African populations from areas that were considered to be natural wildernesses. Second, ecological policy in the various colonies was to some extent homogenized in response to metropolitan imperial agendas, rather than responding to local environmental conditions. Third, in contrast to these unifying trends, colonial environmental policy was skewed by limited funding and the rivalries and often conflicting priorities of different governmental departments. It is important to contrast the cautious excellence of much of colonial trypanosomiasis research with the often confused and ill-planned policies adopted on the ground in peripheral districts like Bunyoro. Colonial ideologies of nature and conservation were never monolithic, and so ecological interventions were frequently applied unevenly and inconsistently, with unfortunate consequences...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Newly {{developed}} turbocharger Swing {{valve assembly}} (arm and bush) {{has to be}} tested to study the product life cycle and to know the satisfactory working throughout entire duty cycle. The turbine housing consists of swing valve assembly used to bypass the exhaust gas directly to atmosphere whenever not required. This assembly consists of two types of fits. Interference fit between turbine housing and <b>bush</b> and <b>clearance</b> fit between <b>bush</b> and arm. But, it is expensive and requires more time to carry out experimental study and measurements can be made only at {{the limited number of}} time stations. So, Finite element method is considered as a standard approach which is economical avoiding frequent experimental studies to find the performance of turbochargers. This paper deals with structural analysis of turbocharger’s swing valve assembly where von misses stress distributions are plotted for both minimum and maximum interference cases due to thermal loads acting b/w bush and turbine housing. Meshed turbocharger and swing valve assembly model is imported to ANSYS for solving and preprocessing and given run for structural analysis. Finally contact pressure v/s time graph is plotted...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 1 For {{applications}} that involved fluids {{with a high}} rate of change of vapor pressure or low specific heat, it was found that there could be inadequate flow through the thrust bearing. This effect was compounded by the heat generation due to the eddy currents that occur in magnetic drive pumps with metallic shells. This paper describes a computer simulation to predict the flows, pressures, and temperatures in magnetic drive sealless pumps. The program has been developed using both theoretical and test work. The objective of the program was to provide reliable selection of magnetic drive pumps; this was accomplished by taking into account the effects of viscosity, vapor pressure, and other liquid properties on the local pressures in the pump. The goal of this program was thus to simulate a customer?s desired application of a particular fluid at an operating pressure, temperature, NPSH, and speed. The resulting conclusion would be whether the customer?s fluid and operating conditions were applicable for sealless pumps. Warnings are output through the graphical user interface of the program at the various points, should flashing occur using the particular fluid. The testing involved a wide range of pump sizes. Within each size, an extensive matrix involved running at different speeds, different cut impeller diameters, and from shutoff through runout condition. The units were tested with different shell configurations and different materials. These included polyetheretherketone (known as PEEK), Alloy C- 276, and a dual containment consisting of both materials. The design of the back shroud influences the magnitude of the hub factor. This is because the traditional affinity laws cannot be applied to the calculation of the axial load for semiopen impeller with a scalloped back shroud, pump out vanes, or pump out slots. One of the important findings was that the impeller hub factor, which is required for the computation of the axial load, changed as a function of speed and cut impeller diameter. It was also found that pump out vanes or pump out slots significantly enhanced the lubrication through the bearings and across magnets. Part of the verification involved performing tests with different <b>bushing</b> <b>clearances</b> and grooving configurations. These were analyzed empirically to confirm the coefficients that were obtained from experimental methods. In order to examine the possible operation of the pump when handling the user?s particular fluid, the flow is simulated in the program using a graphical user interface. A graphical output is given of all the pertinent locations in the systems, such as the thrust collar face or the gap between the driven magnets and the shell. The program currently calculates the pressure, flow, and temperature within the flowpath, along with the axial thrust, at five pump operating flow conditions expressed {{as a percentage of the}} best efficiency point...|$|R
40|$|Auxiliary {{bearings}} are {{a critical}} feature of any magnetic bearing system. They protect the soft iron {{core of the}} magnetic bearing during an overload or failure. An auxiliary bearing typically consists of a rolling element bearing or <b>bushing</b> with a <b>clearance</b> gap between the rotor and the inner race of the support. The dynamics of such systems can be quite complex. It is desired to develop a rotor-dynamic model and assess the dynamic behavior of a magnetic bearing rotor system which includes the effects of auxiliary bearings. Of particular interest is the effects of introducing sideloading into such a system during failure of the magnetic bearing. A model is developed from an experimental test facility {{and a number of}} simulation studies are performed. These results are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{area around}} the village of Naga, in Kassena Nankana {{district}} in northern Ghana is well endowed with rich forests and other natural resources. However, the area is becoming increasingly susceptible to drought, soil erosion and annual bush fires, all of which threaten to undermine the livelihoods of its inhabitants. To prevent further environmental degradation, Participatory Community Development (PACODEV), a women-led NGO based in Ghana, launched a project to help women in the Naga area devise community plans {{for the management of}} natural resources. In November 2003, PACODEV provided training for 25 women from five villages to act as community planning facilitators to guide the planning process. Subsequently, a total of 120 women from these villages formed community planning groups, each with 24 members. Throughout the project, video recorders and cameras were used as a training tool, and to record examples of environmental degradation. The women were then able to use these recordings in the planning sessions to identify areas where action was needed. The equipment was also used to show video documentaries borrowed from the Ghanaian Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Food and Agriculture of Kassena Nankana district. To complement the video recordings, the women were encouraged to draw pictures of their environment. These drawings helped to widen the discussions in the planning groups about environmental problems, including soil erosion, forest <b>clearance,</b> <b>bush</b> fires, drying streams and depleted fish stocks in the rivers. Since 95 % of the women are illiterate, the use of videos and drawings rather than written texts enabled them to participate fully in the training and planning sessions, and make their voices heard in their own language. The resulting community plans prepared by the women´s groups included measures to prevent bush fires and to exploit natural resources in more sustainable ways. They also proposed planting trees to prevent further soil erosion, as well as to provide fruits, fodder for animals and fuelwood for domestic use. The women´s plans were then integrated into one plan for the Naga area, which was presented to the Kassena Nankana district assembly. In addition, the plan has been submitted to several NGOs for possible assistance, including the UNICEF-funded Hunger Project and the African Women´s Development Fund (AWDF). Two other NGOs, the Community Development and Advocacy Centre (CODAC) and the Nature Conservation Research Centre (NCRC), have already expressed interest in supporting the Naga women. mailto:pacodev@yahoo. com Joana Francis Adda is the Country Director of Participatory Community Development (PACODEV), Ghana.
