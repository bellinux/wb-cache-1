5|$|The {{video is}} shot in {{black-and-white}} and {{is set in}} a dimly lit and smoky office, where Beyoncé puts on a private show for a detective (played by actor Brett G. Smith). As the clip begins, the detective is gazing out the window. Beyoncé then arrives and stands in an open doorway while rain pours outside. With wavy hair and winged eyeliner, Beyoncé is dressed in a thigh-length leather trench coat and high stockings. After walking inside the office, she immediately strips off her coat. This reveals a satin dress over black panties and thigh-high pantyhose held up by garters. When the music starts, Beyoncé sits on a desk and plays with her hair, her <b>back</b> <b>facing</b> the face of the detective. The latter leans against his desk while watching Beyoncé, who starts to dance sensually on the desk and flips her hair to seduce him. As Beyoncé dances around the armchair, she exposes her vintage-style underwear.|$|E

25|$|The town's main plaza, officially called Plaza Borda after José de la Borda, is {{commonly}} referred to as the Zócalo. On the north side of this plaza is the Casa Borda (Borda House), the most important non-religious construction in the city. The front facing the Zócalo has two stories, but the <b>back,</b> <b>facing</b> the Plaza de Bernal, has five. This is due to the uneven ground on which the house was built. Much of the house is now dedicated to the Casa de Cultura (Cultural Center) where classes in languages, fine arts and sports such as judo are taught. The rest of the main plaza is surrounded by silver shops, restaurants and bars.|$|E

25|$|The Centre Block, {{departmental}} buildings, {{and a new}} {{residence for}} the governor general were each awarded separately, the team of Thomas Fuller and Chilion Jones, under the pseudonym of Semper Paratus, winning the prize for the first category with their Victorian High Gothic scheme of a formal, symmetrical front facing a quadrangle, and a more rustic, picturesque <b>back</b> <b>facing</b> the escarpment overlooking the Ottawa River. The team of Thomas Stent and Augustus Laver, under the pseudonym of Stat nomen in umbra, won the prize for the second category, which included the East and West Blocks. These proposals were selected for their sophisticated use of Gothic architecture, which was thought to remind people of parliamentary democracy's history, would contradict the republican Neoclassicism of the United States' capital, and would be suited to the rugged surroundings while also being stately. $300,000 was allocated for the main building, and $120,000 {{for each of the}} departmental buildings.|$|E
25|$|The fables in {{the third}} book, as well as others, do not {{strictly}} limit to matters of war and peace. Some present fables that demonstrate how different characters have different needs and motives, which is subjectively rational from each character's viewpoint, and that addressing these needs can empower peaceful relationships even if they start off in a different way. For example, in the fable The Old Man the Young Wife, the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a young woman from a penniless family. The young woman detests his appearance {{so much that she}} refuses to even look at him let alone consummate their marriage. One night, while she sleeps in the same bed with her <b>back</b> <b>facing</b> the old man, a thief enters their house. She is scared, turns over, and for security embraces the man. This thrills every limb of the old man. He feels grateful to the thief for making his young wife hold him at last. The aged man rises and profusely thanks the thief, requesting the intruder to take whatever he desires.|$|E
25|$|The main {{building}} at Graceville had a butterfly roof formed with a reinforced concrete slab lined with bituminous felt and supported on ten pre-cast, reinforced concrete beams that cantilevered off a continuous lintel resting on ten brick piers. A range of materials {{were used to}} fill the gaps between the brick frame: including orange-coloured face brick, screened openings, some small sections of render and various aluminium-framed windows. On either side of this building, two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating were erected. Each {{was made up of}} four sets of steel columns and cantilevered steel tapering I-beams bolted together. The seating, made with timber slats and a steel and timber frame, was placed back-to- <b>back</b> <b>facing</b> each track. Dividing each row of seating were metal ribbed screens. Fitted to each steel column and under each beam were panels framed in steel and filled with glass above the seat level and sheet steel below. The other narrower platform necessitated smaller butterfly-roofed awnings be built there. They were essentially the same construction as the larger ones with only three bays, two of which were given over to seating. The subway system with its street ramps and stairs to both platforms was constructed with reinforced concrete.|$|E

500|$|Thayer's close {{observation}} led him {{to notice}} what scientists such as Edward Bagnall Poulton {{were just beginning to}} describe. This was that many animals were [...] "painted" [...] the opposite way to how painters create the appearance of solidity in figures. A canvas is flat, and areas of uniform color painted on a canvas also appear flat. To make a body appear to have depth and solidity, the artist paints in shadows on the body itself. The top of an animal's <b>back,</b> <b>facing</b> the sky, remains bright, while it must become darker towards its underside. Thayer was excited to realize that by reversing such shading, nature could and did make animals appear flat. He was so passionate about this [...] "concealing coloration" [...] theory that he called it his [...] "second child". Poulton had noticed countershading in certain caterpillars, but he had not realized that the phenomenon was widespread, and he championed Thayer's theory in a 1902 article in Nature.|$|E

500|$|The Keep is [...] in {{diameter}} with a square, spurred base; in the 13th century {{there would have}} been an adjacent turret, on the south-west side, containing latrines, but few traces remain. There {{is no evidence that the}} tower that Burges termed a keep would have fulfilled this function in the medieval period and he appears to have chosen the name because of his initial decision to locate the bedrooms of Lord and Lady Bute in the rebuilt tower. The Kitchen Tower is also [...] across and rests on a square, spurred base. It was originally two storeys high and contained the medieval kitchen; Burgess raised its height and gave it a conical roof and chimneys. The walls of these two towers are around [...] thick at the base, thinning to [...] at the top. The Well Tower at [...] {{in diameter}} is slightly narrower than the Keep or Kitchen Tower, with a well in its lowest chamber sunk into the ground.

500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head2 (also {{known as}} San Lorenzo Monument2) was {{reworked}} from a monumental throne. The head stands [...] high and measures [...] wide by [...] deep; it weighs 20 tons. Colossal Head2 {{was discovered in}} 1945 when Matthew Stirling's guide cleared {{away some of the}} vegetation and mud that covered it. The monument was found lying on its <b>back,</b> <b>facing</b> the sky, and was excavated in 1946 by Stirling and Philip Drucker. In 1962 the monument was removed from the San Lorenzo plateau in order to put it on display as part of [...] "The Olmec tradition" [...] exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston in 1963. San Lorenzo Colossal Head2 is currently in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City. The head was associated with a number of ceramic finds; they have been dated to the Early Preclassic and Late Classic periods. Colossal Head2 wears a complex headdress that sports a horizontal band tied {{at the back of the}} head; this is decorated with three bird's heads that are located above the forehead and temples. The scalp piece is formed from six strips running towards the back of the head. The front of the headdress above the horizontal band is plain. Two short straps hang down from the headdress in front of the ears. The ear jewellery is formed by large squared hoops or framed discs. The left and right ornaments are different, with radial lines on the left earflare, a feature absent on the right earflare. The head is badly damaged due to an unfinished reworking process. This process has pitmarked the entire face with at least 60 smaller hollows and 2 larger holes. The surviving features appear to depict an ageing man with the forehead creased into a frown. The lips are thick and slightly parted to reveal the teeth; the head has a pronounced chin.|$|E

Ovechkin played his first game with the Capitals on 5 October 2005, scoring two goals against goalie Pascal Leclaire in a 3–2 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets. On 13 January 2006, in Anaheim, Ovechkin scored his first career hat trick against Jean-Sébastien Giguère of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim to help Washington win the game. Three days later, on 16 January, he scored a goal that veteran hockey {{reporter}} Bill Clement called [...] "one of the greatest goals of all time." [...] Knocked down by Phoenix Coyotes defenseman Paul Mara and sliding on his <b>back</b> <b>facing</b> away from the net, Ovechkin was able to hook the puck {{with one hand on}} his stick and slide it into the net past goalie Brian Boucher for his second goal of the night.

2500|$|The {{finished}} product was a 20-by-20inch oil {{painting of a}} man {{sitting in a chair}} in an all-white room with his <b>back</b> <b>facing</b> the audience. The cover chosen was the ninth one he painted for the project. Smith discussed the inspiration for the cover after he visited the band at their Maui recording studio. [...] "We talked about {{the world we live in}} and the issues that face our culture. Issues such as political propaganda, a sensationalist media, blind faith and micro-macrocosm were a few of the things we discussed. We liked the idea of a man with his back turned to the world, in a white blank room." [...] The concept was further discussed on his web page. [...] "Is the whiteness purity and peace that he seeks, or the stark cold white of a mental ward? [...] "It's just a guy who has had enough, everything has gotten too heavy and he needs a break from it all. He hasn't given up or surrendered, just created an enlightened microcosm. The minimal white area surrounding the figure is more important than the figure itself, being that it can represent health or paranoia." [...] The image is repeated on the disc itself.|$|E

The photos show Kardashian with her hair tied up in a bun, wearing only a pearl necklace, a pair of earrings and black satin gloves, and, on the cover, with her bare <b>back</b> <b>facing</b> the camera, holding a sequined gown below her bare, oiled-up buttocks, while smiling broadly at the camera. A Time magazine writer commented that, unlike previous celebrities' nudes that represented the women's rebellion against repressed society and [...] "trying to tear down" [...] barriers, Kardashian's exhibition was [...] "just provocation and bluster, repeated images that seem to offer us some sort of truth or insight but are really just self serving. We want there to be something more, some reason or context, some great explanation that tells us {{what it is like}} to live in this very day and age, but there is not.

40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} test program has been {{conducted}} to define convective heating environments on the back-face of a Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator aeroshell. Wind tunnel testing was conducted at Mach 6 and Mach 10 at unit Reynolds numbers from 0. 510 (exp 6) /ft to 3. 910 (exp 6) /ft on a 6. 3088 in diameter aeroshell model. Global heating data were obtained through phosphor thermography on the aeroshell <b>back</b> <b>face,</b> {{as well as on}} the payload and the aeroshell front face. For all test conditions, laminar flow was produced on the aeroshell front face, while the separated wake shear layer and aeroshell back-face boundary layer were transitional or turbulent. Along the leeward centerline of the aeroshell <b>back</b> <b>face</b> and payload centerbody, heating levels increased with both free stream Reynolds number and angle of attack. The Reynolds number dependency was due to increasing strength of wake turbulence with Reynolds number. The angle-of-attack dependency was due to movement of the wake-vortex reattachment point on the aeroshell <b>back</b> <b>face.</b> The maximum heating levels on the aeroshell <b>back</b> <b>face</b> and payload were approximately 5 % to 6 %, respectively, of the aeroshell front-face stagnation point. To allow for extrapolation of the ground test data to flight conditions, the <b>back</b> <b>face</b> and payload heating levels were correlated as a function of aeroshell front-face peak momentum thickness Reynolds numbers...|$|R
