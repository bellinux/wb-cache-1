5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the <b>biasing</b> is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{structure}} {{available is}} λ/2 open-circuit stubs {{across the line}} coupled with λ/4 impedance transformers. This topology has both low-pass and band-pass characteristics. Because it will pass DC, {{it is possible to}} transmit <b>biasing</b> voltages to active components without the need for blocking capacitors. Also, since short-circuit links are not required, no assembly operations other than the board printing are required when implemented as stripline. The disadvantages are (i) the filter will take up more board real estate than the corresponding λ/4 stub filter, since the stubs are all twice as long; (ii) the first spurious passband is at 2ω0, as opposed to 3ω0 for the λ/4 stub filter.|$|E
25|$|Later circuits, after tubes {{were made}} with heaters {{isolated}} from their cathodes, used cathode <b>biasing,</b> avoiding {{the need for a}} separate negative power supply. For cathode <b>biasing,</b> a relatively low-value resistor is connected between the cathode and ground. This makes the cathode positive with respect to the grid, which is at ground potential for DC.|$|E

Studies have internal validity when, random error apart, reported differences between exposed and unexposed individuals can be attributed only to the exposure under investigation.

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that implicit <b>biases</b> predict non-verbal behavior and that exposure to racially <b>biased</b> non-verbal messages can increase implicit <b>bias</b> against racial outgroups. Taken together, {{these findings suggest that}} implicit <b>bias</b> can be viewed as contagious. In other words, observers of non-verbal <b>bias</b> develop implicit <b>bias,</b> which is behaviorally expressed as non-verbal <b>bias,</b> leading to the development of implicit <b>bias</b> among those who observe them. Moreover, accompanying verbal messages may moderate the effects of non-verbal messages on <b>bias</b> development. The literature on persuasion suggests that pairing explicit verbal messages with non-verbal messages has the potential to interfere with the development of <b>bias.</b> ^ The overall aim of this research was to determine whether and under what conditions exposure to non-verbal <b>bias</b> results in implicit <b>bias</b> development. Hypothesis 1 was that exposure to non-verbal <b>bias</b> against a novel social target would result in implicit <b>bias.</b> Study 1 participants formed implicit <b>biases,</b> but not in the expected direction. However, they did demonstrate <b>biased</b> non-verbal behavior consistent with the observed non-verbal <b>bias.</b> In Studies 2 and 3 Hypothesis 1 was fully supported, providing evidence of social <b>bias</b> resulting from exposure to <b>biased</b> non-verbal behavior. Hypothesis 2 was that verbal messages that convey <b>bias</b> (positive or negative) would interfere with implicit <b>bias</b> development. Non-verbal messages were expected to have the strongest effect on implicit <b>bias</b> when paired with verbal messages, conveying equality among social targets. This hypothesis was fully supported in Studies 2 and 3, participants only showed evidence of non-verbal message consistent implicit <b>bias</b> in the neutral verbal message condition. The final goal of this research was to obtain neural evidence of <b>bias</b> development. Hypothesis 3 was that activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) would differentiate social targets. As predicted, participants showed less mPFC activation in response to targets of non-verbal <b>bias</b> relative to comparison targets, but only in the equality message condition. Results support the notion that implicit <b>bias</b> can spread via exposure to non-verbal <b>bias,</b> and that it is most contagious when paired with verbal equality messages. Implications of these findings and future directions for this research are discussed. ...|$|R
