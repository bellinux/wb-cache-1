5|$|Banksia cuneata was {{declared}} critically endangered after a 1982 survey found only five populations comprising about 450 plants. The largest population, consisting of around 300 plants, {{was on a}} conservation reserve, but all others were on road verges, and contained only 50–70 plants each. However, since then more plants have been located, and populations {{have been found to}} be gradually increasing in response to a number of conservation measures including fencing and baiting of rabbits. In recognition of its slight recovery, it is now considered endangered <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> critically so.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the stone}} taken from the castle was used to {{construct}} the mid-eighteenth-century grade II-listed buildings at 43 and 45 Castle Street, and other buildings known to have used the stone, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> extant, include old houses demolished to build the Castle Mill textile factory. The mill, now demolished, {{was said to have}} been built on castle foundations up to 4m (12ft) thick; 15 Castle Street also rests on the old foundation wall. It is likely that the former Melbourne Furnace and the Furnace Farm barn also used recycled castle material.|$|E
5|$|The {{share of}} public {{spending}} in GDP increased from 27% in 1995 to 30% in 2000. Some poorer provinces had depended on state enterprises or on inefficient industries, such as sugar, {{which could not}} compete when trade was opened. To quell social unrest, provincial governors padded their payrolls. The government had embarked on a pension reform with costs reaching 3% of GDP in 2000, as it still had to pay pensioners <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> received contributions.|$|E
5|$|After the Myst series' success, various {{proposals}} for films and television series {{based on the}} franchise were planned or rumored. The Sci Fi Channel announced in 2002 that a TV miniseries would be produced based on Myst, to be produced by Mandalay Television Pictures in association with Columbia TriStar Domestic Television and Cyan, but never materialized. According to Rand Miller, none of the various proposals met Cyan's approval, or were too formulaic or silly. Independent filmmakers Patrick McIntire and Adrian Vanderbosch, themselves Myst fans, took {{it upon themselves to}} produce a motion picture based on the story revealed in the Myst novels. In 2006, the filmmakers sent a DVD proposal to Cyan. The developers gave the filmmakers permission to begin production. The film was set {{to be based on the}} novel Myst: The Book of Ti'ana, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> appears to be in production.|$|E

5|$|Americium is {{produced}} mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of {{spent nuclear fuel}} contains about 100grams of various americium isotopes, mostly 241Am and 243Am. Their prolonged radioactivity is undesirable for the disposal, and therefore americium, together with other long-lived actinides, must be neutralized. The associated procedure may involve several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as nuclear transmutation, {{but it is still}} being developed for americium. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> do so.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary farm {{buildings}} {{associated with the}} mansion include the original springhouse. To {{the rear of the}} home the oldest section of residence can be seen. The ell consists of four rooms as well as the kitchen and smokehouse. The smokehouse was built as part of the existing structure, and not free standing as is most often seen. The rear ell structure served as the first residence for the family while the primary residence was constructed. To the east of the house is the family burial ground. Behind the house is a flower garden. The slave cemetery lies beyond the flower garden. Documented <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> existing buildings include multiple slave houses, a large stable due-west of the mansion, an ash house, and a garden house.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of einsteinium, any primordial einsteinium, that is einsteinium that could possibly be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of einsteinium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, all terrestrial einsteinium is produced in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few years}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium, including einsteinium, occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> do so. Einsteinium was observed in Przybylski's Star in 2008.|$|E

Synthesis of fermium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, most fermium is produced on Earth in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few months}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium did occur naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> do so.|$|E
5|$|Both Dorton Halt and Brill and Ludgersall {{stations}} were closed on 7 January 1963 and trains no longer stop, although the line through them remains in use by trains between Princes Risborough and Bicester North. Quainton Road station was bought in 1969 {{by members of}} the London Railway Preservation Society to use as a permanent base, and now houses the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. The station is still connected to the railway network and used by freight trains and occasional special passenger services, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> has a scheduled passenger service. There are no longer any open railway stations in the areas formerly served by the tramway. Plans have been proposed by the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre to rebuild and reopen a stretch of the tramway as a heritage railway.|$|E
5|$|Chesbro was {{inducted}} into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 balloting by the Veterans Committee, which considers individuals who are eligible for the Hall of Fame, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> eligible to be elected by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). That year, the Veterans Committee elected eleven players: Chesbro, Jesse Burkett, Frank Chance, Johnny Evers, Clark Griffith, Tommy McCarthy, Joe McGinnity, Eddie Plank, Joe Tinker, Rube Waddell, and Ed Walsh. During years where Chesbro was eligible on the BBWAA ballot, Chesbro received zero votes in the 1936 balloting, one vote in the 1937 balloting, two votes in the 1938 balloting, and six votes in the 1939 balloting, zero votes in the 1942 balloting, and zero votes in the 1945 balloting.|$|E

5|$|Elcor sat atop {{a bed of}} {{taconite}} {{consisting of}} a uniform mixture of about 30% iron, interspersed with pockets of high-grade ore, {{a part of the}} Biwabik iron formation. The Biwabik iron formation is a large sheet of iron-bearing sediment deposited during the Precambrian era {{on the bottom of the}} Animikie Sea. This iron-bearing rock extends under Lake Superior from the Mesabi and Vermilion Iron Ranges, to the Gogebic Iron Range from northern Wisconsin into the Marquette Range of the upper peninsula of Michigan, and west to the manganese-rich ore of the Cuyuna Iron Range. Michigan's steel-blue high grade ores were quite different from the Mesabi ore, which was soft brown hematite. There is iron in other areas of Minnesota, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> in quantities that are practical to mine.|$|E
5|$|Haumea is a plutoid, a dwarf planet beyond Neptune's orbit. It is {{classified}} as a dwarf planet because it is presumed to be massive enough to have been rounded by its own gravity into a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium, but not massive enough to have cleared its neighbourhood of similarly sized objects. Haumea was initially listed as a classical Kuiper belt object in 2006 by the Minor Planet Center, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer.</b> The nominal trajectory suggests that Haumea is in a weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune, {{which would make it}} a resonant object instead. Although there are precovery images of Haumea dating back to March 22, 1955 from the Palomar Mountain Digitized Sky Survey, further observations of the orbit will be required to verify its dynamic status.|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{selected}} the 32nd Infantry Division for the Saidor operation {{as it was}} at Goodenough Island <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> required for the New Britain campaign. The assistant division commander, Brigadier General Clarence A. Martin, was appointed commander of Michaelmas Task Force, which was built around the 126th Infantry Regimental Combat Team. The 126th Infantry Regiment had been rebuilt after the Battle of Buna–Gona and had received six weeks' amphibious training in Australia and a further three weeks' training at Milne Bay. Units assigned to the task force were at Goodenough Island, Milne Bay, Oro Bay, Lae, Finschhafen, Port Moresby, Kiriwina, Arawe, and Cape Cretin, and in Australia.|$|E
