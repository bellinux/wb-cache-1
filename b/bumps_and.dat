5|$|The circuit was resurfaced {{ahead of}} the race weekend, {{smoothing}} out many of the <b>bumps</b> <b>and</b> imperfections that had developed over time. The new surface—introduced to allow the circuit to accommodate a round of the MotoGP World Championship—saw teams projecting lap times of under 1:06.000 for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The fogstand beetle of the Namib Desert, Stenocara gracilipes, is able {{to collect}} water from fog, as its elytra have a {{textured}} surface combining hydrophilic (water-loving) <b>bumps</b> <b>and</b> waxy, hydrophobic troughs. The beetle faces the early morning breeze, holding up its abdomen; droplets condense on the elytra and run along ridges towards their mouthparts. Similar adaptations are found in several other Namib desert beetles such as Onymacris unguicularis.|$|E
5|$|During evolution, some {{structures}} {{may lose}} their original function and become vestigial structures. Such structures {{may have little}} or no function in a current species, yet have a clear function in ancestral species, or other closely related species. Examples include pseudogenes, the non-functional remains of eyes in blind cave-dwelling fish, wings in flightless birds, the presence of hip bones in whales and snakes, and sexual traits in organisms that reproduce via asexual reproduction. Examples of vestigial structures in humans include wisdom teeth, the coccyx, the vermiform appendix, and other behavioural vestiges such as goose <b>bumps</b> <b>and</b> primitive reflexes.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening {{for part of the}} wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (<b>bumps</b> <b>and</b> holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E

After successfully petitioning the city council, Homer embarks on a public safety crusade that involves placing speed <b>bumps</b> <b>and</b> warning signs throughout the town.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{examination}} of the bullet can exclude {{a large number of}} weapons by examining the general characteristics of a recovered bullet. By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number of weapons can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing that type of bullet. The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different class characteristics that are common to specific manufactures. The three main class characteristics of all bullets are the lands and grooves, the caliber of the bullet, and the rifling twist. All three can be tied directly to the type of barrel that was used to fire the bullet. The lands and grooves of barrel are the <b>bumps</b> <b>and</b> valleys created when the rifling is created. The caliber is the diameter of the barrel. The twist is the direction of the striations left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed twist with the exception of weapons created by the Colt's Manufacturing Company which uses left-handed twists. Weapon barrels that match the class characteristics of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual characteristics to determine if the bullet came from that particular weapon.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by a 2001 paper of Choie and Kim and a 2006 paper of <b>Bump</b> <b>and</b> Choie. The paper of Choie and Kim extends an earlier result of Bol for elliptic modular forms to the setting of Siegel and Jacobi forms. The paper of <b>Bump</b> <b>and</b> Choie provides a representation theoretic interpretation of the phenomenon, and shows how a natural generalization of Choie and Kim's result on Siegel modular forms follows from a natural conjecture regarding (g,K) -modules. In this paper, it is shown that the conjecture of <b>Bump</b> <b>and</b> Choie follows from work of Boe. A second proof which is {{along the lines of}} the proof given by <b>Bump</b> <b>and</b> Choie in the genus 2 case is also included, as is a similar treatment of the result of Choie and Kim on Jacobi forms.

25|$|Homology {{includes}} a unique group of shared structures {{referred to as}} vestigial structures. Vestigial refers to anatomical parts that are of minimal, if any, value to the organism that possesses them.

Such is the case in whales, which have small vestigial bones that appear to be remnants of the leg bones of their ancestors which walked on land. Humans also have vestigial structures, including the ear muscles, the wisdom teeth, the appendix, the tail bone, body hair (including goose <b>bumps),</b> <b>and</b> the semilunar fold in the corner of the eye.|$|E

The jolts and shocks of the ship in the hold of the energy ribbon were created by camera <b>bumps</b> <b>and</b> motors to shake the set. Filming of the scenes took place in April 1994, while residents were still skittish from the recent 1994 Northridge earthquake; the effects staff deliberately hid the set shakers until cameras were rolling to elecit more genuine reactions. The Amargosa observatory set was an elaborate redress of the Enterprise-B bridge, with an added back room, second level, and swapped walls changing the layout to appear a different setting. Control panels styled after those in the original Star Trek television series helped suggest {{the age of the}} station.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Adult Swim {{replaced}} its lineup with Toonami, {{a former}} programming block from Cartoon Network.

T.O.M. also presented a review of Mass Effect 3 and promoted the recent DVD releases of the series featured.

25|$|Barks's stories (whether humorous adventures or {{domestic}} comedies) often exhibited a wry, dark irony born of hard experience. The ten-pagers showcased Donald as everyman, struggling against the cruel <b>bumps</b> <b>and</b> bruises {{of everyday life}} with the nephews often acting as a Greek chorus commenting on the unfolding disasters Donald wrought upon himself. Yet while seemingly defeatist in tone, the humanity of the characters shines through in their persistence despite the obstacles. These stories found popularity not only among young children but adults as well. Despite the fact that Barks had done little traveling his adventure stories often had the duck clan globe-trotting to the most remote or spectacular of places. This allowed Barks to indulge his penchant for elaborate backgrounds that hinted at his thwarted ambitions of doing realistic stories in the vein of Hal Foster's Prince Valiant.|$|E
