5|$|Although {{earmarked}} for operations against the Soviet Union, Luftflotte 2 {{remained in the}} west until May 1941. This was partly as a deception measure, and partly because new airbases in Poland could not <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> <b>by</b> 1 June 1941 target date, although they were made ready {{in time for the}} actual commencement of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941. Kesselring established his new headquarters at Bielany, a suburb of Warsaw.|$|E

5|$|Helvellyn may be {{included}} in a traverse of the full length of the Helvellyn range in either direction, but with a greater sense of climax when starting from the north. Most of the ridge track is a bridleway and so the route can <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> <b>by</b> mountain bike in a challenging six-hour circular route of 16 miles off-road and 10 miles on-road riding. This may begin (and finish) at Mill Bridge near Grasmere.|$|E

5|$|Initial plans {{had called}} for the bridge to <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> <b>by</b> October 1972. On 28 December 1968, the company asked the road {{administration}} if construction could be quickened. They estimated that the bridge could <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> <b>by</b> December 1971 for a price increase of NOK750,000. This gave the company NOK2 million more in profits, as it could more quickly start collecting toll revenue. The company chose to accept this extra cost. The start of construction was delayed, first by the parliamentary decision coming right before the holidays, followed immediately by a national strike by engineers. The contract for the foundation and concrete work was won by Selmer, who started work in March 1969. The steel-work contracts were issued to Høsveis, Bofa and Alfred Andersen; despite them not having the lowest bid, the road administration chose to use the largest companies.|$|E

5|$|The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) began a {{rehabilitation}} {{program for the}} lower and upper levels of the highway in 2005.

5|$|The {{last two}} {{conditions}} {{were the most}} controversial, though after {{one and a half}} years, a compromise was reached: only buildings actually in use would be repaired, and pensions would be paid, but only when the officers actually retired. The British authorities authorised minimal repairs, to be made as cheaply as possible. The transfer was intended to <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> <b>by</b> the end of 1885, but was not finalised until 31 March 1886.|$|E
5|$|The new Greenville Bridge {{opened to}} traffic on August 4, 2010.

5|$|The {{station was}} {{scheduled}} to <b>be</b> <b>completed</b> <b>by</b> May 16, 2016, but the estimated completion date was pushed back to October 2016.

However, the 86th Street station passed all required systems testing by December 18, 2016. The station opened on January 1, 2017.|$|E
