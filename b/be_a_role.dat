25|$|Physicians like al-Razi {{wrote about}} the {{importance}} of morality in medicine, and may have presented, together with Avicenna and Ibn al-Nafis, the first concept of ethics in Islamic medicine. He felt that it was important not only for the physician to be an expert in his field, but also to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> model. His ideas on medical ethics were divided into three concepts: the physician's responsibility to patients and to self, and also the patients’ responsibility to physicians.|$|E
25|$|With the 1969 {{reform in}} place, the {{acceptance}} of homosexual acts or homosexual identities for West Germans was far from in place. Most reformers agreed that decriminalizing sexual relations between adult men {{was not the same}} as advocating an acceptance of homosexual men. While the old view of “militarized” masculinity may have phased out, “family-centered” masculinity was now grounded in the traditional male, and being a proper man meant being a proper father, which was believed at the time to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> a homosexual male could not fulfill.|$|E
25|$|Sertraline has {{relatively}} high (nanomolar) {{affinity for the}} sigma σ1 receptor. Conversely, it has low (micromolar) and insignificant affinity for the σ2 receptor. It acts as an antagonist of the σ1 receptor, {{and is able to}} reverse σ1 receptor-dependent actions of fluvoxamine, a potent agonist of the receptor, in vitro. However, the affinity of sertraline for the σ1 receptor is more than 100-fold lower than for the SERT. Although there could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> for the σ1 receptor in the pharmacology of sertraline, the significance of this receptor in its actions is unclear and perhaps questionable.|$|E

25|$|In September 2004, he was {{appointed}} as assistant coach to the England cricket team, and announced his retirement as a player shortly after, feeling he no longer enjoyed batting. In his short spell as an international coach, he caused some controversy. His appointment was criticised by former England captain Mike Atherton, who felt that the job should not have gone to someone {{who had been on}} the rebel tour of South Africa. His attitude came under fire from former coach Keith Fletcher, who accused him of being too fond of drinking and partying, to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> model for young international cricketers. He hit back at Fletcher, criticising his management skills. Maynard continued to coach the England side and at one point drafted in professional lyricists to help him compose an England team song.|$|E

[...] In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a [...] "threat to learning" [...] because of his [...] "underachiever and proud of it" [...] attitude and negative attitude regarding his education.

Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who had been waging a citywide campaign against graffiti that had resulted in over 300 citations during the year, was angry and criticized Bono for defacing a San Francisco landmark. She said, [...] "I am disappointed that a rock star who is supposed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> model for young people chose to vandalize the work of another artist. The unfortunate incident marred an otherwise wonderful rock concert." [...] Bono was issued a citation for misdemeanor malicious mischief. [...] U2 manager Paul McGuinness said, [...] "This is clearly not an act of vandalism. This act was clearly in the spirit of the artwork itself." [...] The numerous callers to Ronn Owens' radio talk show on KGO-AM were evenly split, with younger listeners defending the singer's action and older ones not. [...] Bono soon apologized, saying [...] "I really do regret it. It was dumb." [...] The singer explained that he thought that he was honoring the artist's work and that the artist had agreed, but later Bono realized that the city owned the fountain. The group covered the cost of removal of the graffiti.|$|E
500|$|Workman, {{herself an}} ardent feminist and a {{supporter}} of women's suffrage, wanted her readers to understand how her contributions and achievements reflected all women's potential. In her writings, Workman described herself as [...] "questioning or violating the norms of Victorian female propriety". She demonstrated that women were strong enough to thrive outside the home by showing {{how easy it was}} for her to endure strenuous physical activities like bicycling long distances in hot, humid places or mountaineering in cold temperatures and high altitudes. Workman challenged a masculine realm; her obituary in the Alpine Journal alluded to the challenges she faced, saying that she [...] "felt that she suffered from 'sex antagonism'". The author of the piece added: [...] "it is possible that some unconscious feeling let us say of the novelty of a woman's intrusion into the domain of exploration so long reserved to man, may in some quarters have existed... there tended to arise... an atmosphere shall we say of aloofness?" [...] However, in her study of Victorian mountaineering, Ann Colley suggests that gender discrimination was more overt at lower elevations and in regular life than at higher elevations, such as in the Himalaya. Colley states, [...] "Away from such petty opinion emanating from society pressures, up high, above the snow line or in distant regions, women climbers could more fully experience equality and power... If they chose, they could be just as sportsmanlike or competitive as the men." [...] In her entry about Workman in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Tingley sums Workman up as [...] "an aggressive, determined, and uncompromising turn-of-the-century American woman traveler" [...] and [...] "one of the first women to work as a professional mountaineer and surveyor and to write about the expeditions she and her husband took to the most remote reaches of the Himalaya. She was an outspoken advocate of woman's suffrage and made it clear that she considered herself to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> model for other women travelers and mountaineers." ...|$|E
