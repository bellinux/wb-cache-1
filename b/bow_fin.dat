50|$|In the mid-1970s, Gordon Fisher, a {{respected}} Canadian sailor, commissioned designer Mark Ellis {{to create a}} design for a cruising sailboat which would have decent accommodations, but still be easy for a singlehander to manage. Ellis designed a Ljungstrom-type rig modified with a wishbone boom, on a 30-foot modern hull with a plumb <b>bow,</b> <b>fin</b> keel and balanced rudder. A beam of nearly 12 feet and cambered house-top created a large interior with accommodation equal to a standard yacht several feet longer. George Hinterhoeller, after some initial reservations about the design, agreed to build the boats, and the first 30 ft Nonsuch rolled out of his shop {{in the summer of}} 1978.|$|E

40|$|The {{specific}} and subspecific taxonomies of African primate populations such as Cheirogaleus and the Galagidae have been challenged {{in recent years}} (Bearder, Honess, Bayes, Ambrose, and Anderson 1995; Groves 2000), {{and it has been}} suggested that the taxonomy of another group, Perodicticus, may not adequately reflect the diversity of its members either (Schwartz and Beutel 1995; Grubb, Butynski, Oates, et al. 2003). Taxonomies are an organizational framework used by researchers conducting comparative studies, and their completeness and accuracy is important for evolution and systematics. A representative sample (N= 132) of specimens allocated to Perodicticus, representing the entire known geographic range of the genus, was examined and described by dentition, cranium, post-cranium, and pelage. Measurements were taken with sliding calipers, and tape and non-metric descriptions are supported by photographs. The descriptions (observed values) were then compared to summaries of distinguishing and diagnostic descriptive traits received from previous taxonomies (expected values). Specimens were found that were highly congruent with traditional descriptions of the taxa Perodicticus potto edwardsi, Perodicticus potto ibeanus, and Perodicticus potto potto. A single specimen was found that matches the expected description for Perodicticus potto faustus, which is not taken as support for reviving that taxon out of its synonymy with Perodicticus potto edwardsi. Specimens were found that partially resemble the descriptions for Perodicticus potto ju-ju and have been tentatively identified as such. Previously undescribed features present in the population assigned to the genus Perodicticus have also been found, including a <b>bowed</b> <b>fin</b> on the mesial margin of the lower (caniniform) anterior premolar in most of the specimens conforming to the descriptions for P. p. ju-ju and P. p. potto...|$|R
40|$|An {{extremely}} large, systematic, axisymmetric body/tail fin {{data base}} was gathered through tests of an innovative missile model design which is described herein. These data were originally obtained for incorporation into a missile aerodynamics code based on engineering methods (Program MISSILE 3), {{but can also}} be used as diagnostic test cases for developing computational methods because of the individual-fin data included in the data base. Detailed analysis of four sample cases from these data are presented to illustrate interesting individual-fin force and moment trends. These samples quantitatively show how <b>bow</b> shock, <b>fin</b> orientation, fin deflection, and body vortices can produce strong, unusual, and computationally challenging effects on individual fin loads. Comparisons between these data and calculations from the SWINT Euler code are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Interest {{in the use}} of anti-pitching fins {{on ships}} has been in-creasing in recent years. It has been found that {{although}} <b>bow</b> anti-pitching <b>fins</b> appreciably reduce pitch amplitudes, serious transverse bow vibrations have accompanied their use. These vibrations are es-pecially serious when the ship operates in heavy seas and appear to be induced when the ship's bow is pitching down. One explanation of the cause of these vibrations is that they result from flow separation on the top surface of the fin when the hydrodynamic angle of attack exceeds the angle of breakdown. This causes asymmetric impulses to be transmitted to the ship's bow struc-ture causing it to vibrate at resonant frequency. This thesis investigated using boundary layer suction to delay boundary layer breakdown and extend the angle of breakdown beyond the hydrodynamic angle of attack which could be expected. A model of...|$|R
40|$|Semi-SWATH ship {{design is}} a result of {{combining}} the good features of SWATH and Catamaran designs. However, the disadvantage of semi-SWATH is that she has low restoring force at bow that causes a tendency to bow-dive when running in following seas. In some critical conditions, the foredeck was found to be immersed underwater. One of the efforts to improve the ship???s performance is to install <b>fin</b> stabilizers at <b>bow</b> and stern. The fin stabilizers are used to compensate for the low restoring force at the bow by increasing the lift force and damping force. A fuzzy logic controller developed for the system gives the ability to transform human knowledge and experience into the controller system and also to regulate the fin angle. A numerical simulation program developed in time domain for surge, heave, and pitch motions are then validated by seakeeping tests in towing tank of Marine Technology Centre, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. Using the simulation program, parametric study was conducted to relate the ship and wave parameters with the ship???s performance characteristics. The ship with fixed fin stabilizers has the bow-dive and immersed foredeck conditions at the following situations: for wave height to length ratio, Hw/Lw = 0. 07, the wave to ship length ratio is 1. 1 ??? Lw/Ls 1. 6, {{it was found that the}} foredeck was immersed with low surfing speed. Meanwhile, for the ship with fixed <b>fin</b> at <b>bow</b> and active <b>fin</b> at the stern, it was found that bow-diving and immersed foredeck did not occur...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} fin-leading-edge radius and sweep angle on peak heating rates due to shock-shock {{interactions}} were investigated in the NASA Langley Research Center 20 -inch Mach 6 Air Tunnel. The fin model leading edges, which represent cylindrical leading edges or struts on hypersonic vehicles, were varied from 0. 25 inches to 0. 75 inches in radius. A 9 deg wedge generated a planar oblique shock at 16. 7 deg to the flow that intersected the <b>fin</b> <b>bow</b> shock, producing a shock-shock interaction that impinged on the fin leading edge. The fin {{angle of attack}} was varied from 0 deg (normal to the free-stream) to 15 deg and 25 deg swept forward. Global temperature data {{was obtained from the}} surface of the fused silica fins through phosphor thermography. Metal oil flow models with the same geometries as the fused silica models were used to visualize the streamline patterns for each angle of attack. High-speed zoom-schlieren videos were recorded to show the features and temporal unsteadiness of the shock-shock interactions. The temperature data were analyzed using one-dimensional semi-infinite as well as one- and two-dimensional finite-volume methods to determine the proper heat transfer analysis approach to minimize errors from lateral heat conduction due to the presence of strong surface temperature gradients induced by the shock interactions. The general trends in the leading-edge heat transfer behavior were similar for the three shock-shock interactions, respectively, between the test articles with varying leading-edge radius. The dimensional peak heat transfer coefficient augmentation increased with decreasing leading-edge radius. The dimensional peak heat transfer output from the two-dimensional code was about 20 % higher than the value from a standard, semi-infinite one-dimensional method...|$|R
