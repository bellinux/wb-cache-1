Unbeknownst to the dealers, he had in some cases hired someone to roll back the odometers on them, making the vehicles appear to have less mileage than they actually did. Thus they commanded an artificially higher price, both when the dealer paid Schmuck and when they sold it to a customer. In order for the retail transaction to take place, the dealers needed to mail a title application, including the falsified odometer reading, to the state Department of Transportation.|$|E

500|$|After the {{recording}} of [...] "Crazy for You", the soundtrack single for the 1985 coming of age drama Vision Quest, Madonna approached John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to produce another of her self-written songs called [...] "Gambler". Subsequently, the song {{was added to the}} soundtrack of the film, as music producer Phil Ramone felt that it would be appropriate for using in the beginning shots of the film. Madonna explained that the track [...] "is really the girl's point of view, because she's, like, an unstoppable person... She doesn't really need this guy". As the song was recorded on the Geffen label, a commercial issue of the single, in the United States was suppressed, at the request of Madonna's Sire Records management. They feared that commercial availability of another Madonna single would have been detrimental to the other singles from the Like a Virgin album, and the already available, Geffen-distributed, [...] "Crazy for You". Hence [...] "Gambler" [...] was never released, or sent for airplay in the United States. The UK 12" [...] single, contained the Extended Dance Mix, Instrumental Remix, and the song [...] "Nature of the Beach" [...] by Black 'n Blue. [...] The 7" [...] single had the original version, and [...] "Nature of the Beach". The video for [...] "Gambler" [...] is similar to [...] "Crazy for You", with Madonna singing the song along with clips culled from Vision Quest. Madonna filmed her performance on November 22, 1983, at the <b>Big</b> <b>Foot</b> Tavern in Spokane, Washington. [...] "Gambler" [...] remained Madonna's last single written entirely by herself for over two decades, until [...] "Hey You" [...] (2007). According to Stylus Magazine, Madonna said that she got too lazy to write songs without help.|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "Bigfoot" [...] {{was first}} {{recorded}} by Americans {{in the late}} 19th century. Spotted Elk, also called Chief <b>Big</b> <b>Foot,</b> was a well-known Lakota leader who was killed during the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890. He was famous in his time {{and may have been}} the namesake for two fabled bears in the West. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, at least two enormous marauding grizzly bears were widely noted in the press and each nicknamed [...] "Bigfoot".
