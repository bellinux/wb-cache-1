40|$|Polyphenols are {{naturally}} derived bioactive compounds with numerous reported health benefits. We have previously {{reported on the}} beneficial effect of a polyphenol-enriched apple extract in a murine model of food allergy. The objectives {{of the present study}} were to elucidate the class of bioactive polyphenols that exhibit a beneficial anti-allergic effect and to assess whether the protective effect matches the in vivo <b>bioavailable</b> <b>metabolite</b> concentrations. Female BALB/c mice were sensitised to ovalbumin (OVA) following the protocol of a well-established murine model of food allergy. They were fed diets containing polyphenol-enriched extracts or purified epicatechin for 8 d after the last sensitisation. The sensitised mice were orally challenged with OVA after the intervention. The allergy symptoms, in addition to allergen-specific serum Ig concentrations and gene expression profiles in the intestine, of the control and treated mice were compared. Plasma samples were collected to compare the concentrations of bioavailable epicatechin metabolites in the treatment groups. Polyphenol-enriched fruit extracts containing epicatechin exhibited a significant anti-allergic effect in vivo. This effect was unambiguously attributed to epicatechin, as oral administration of this purified polyphenol to sensitised mice by inclusion in their diet modulated allergy symptoms in a dose-dependent manner. Immune parameters were also affected by the administration of epicatechin. Bioavailability measurements in plasma indicated that the attenuation of allergy symptoms could be due to the higher concentrations of bioavailable epicatechin metabolites. In conclusion, epicatechin is a key bioactive polyphenol that has the ability to modulate allergy outcomes in sensitised mic...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, polyphenols, and {{flavonoids}} in particular, have attracted the interest of researchers, {{as they have been}} associated with the health-promoting effects derived from diets rich in vegetables and fruits, including moderate wine consumption. Recent scientific evidence suggests that wine polyphenols exert their effects through interactions with the gut microbiota, as they seem to modulate microbiota and, at the same time, are metabolized by intestinal bacteria into specific <b>bioavailable</b> <b>metabolites.</b> Microbial metabolites are better absorbed than their precursors and may be responsible for positive health activities in the digestive system (local effects) and, after being absorbed, in tissues and organs (systemic effects). Differences in gut microbiota composition and functionality among individuals can affect polyphenol activity and, therefore, their health effects. The aim of this review is to integrate the understanding of the metabolism and mechanisms of action of wine polyphenols at both local and systemic levels, underlining their impact on the gut microbiome and the inter-individual variability associated with polyphenols’ metabolism and further physiological effects. The advent of promising dietary approaches linked to wine polyphenols beyond the gut microbiota community and metabolism are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Cinnamon (Cinnamomum {{zeylanicum}} L.) bark {{is widely}} used as a spice and in traditional medicine. Its oligomeric and polymeric proanthocyanidins {{are believed to be}} partly responsible for the beneficial properties of the plant. We describe here the metabolic fate of cinnamon proanthocyanidins in the urine and feces of rats fed a suspension of the whole bark. The metabolites include ten mono-, di-, and tri- conjugated (epi) catechin phase II metabolites and more than 20 small phenolic acids from intestinal microbial fermentation. Some of these are sulfated conjugates. Feces contain intact (epi) catechin and dimers. This suggests that free radical scavenging species are in contact with the intestinal walls for hours after ingestion of cinnamon. The phenolic metabolite profile of cinnamon bark in urine is consistent with a mixture of proanthocyanidins that are depolymerized into their constitutive (epi) catechin units as well as cleaved into smaller phenolic acids during their transit along the intestinal tract, with subsequent absorption and conjugation into <b>bioavailable</b> <b>metabolites.</b> This work was supported by the SpanishMinistry of Education and Science (AGL 2009 – 12374 -C 03 – 03 /ALI).

40|$|Epidemiological and {{clinical}} {{studies show that}} diets with a high antioxidant capacity, such us those rich in plant food and beverages, are associated with significant decreases in the overall risk of cardiovascular disease or colorectal cancer. Current studies on dietary antioxidants and dietary antioxidant capacity focus exclusively on low molecular weight or soluble antioxidants (vitamins C and E, phenolic compounds and carotenoids), ignoring macromolecular antioxidants. These are polymeric phenolic compounds or polyphenols and carotenoids linked to plant food macromolecules that yield <b>bioavailable</b> <b>metabolites</b> {{by the action of}} the microbiota with significant effects either local and/or systemic after absorption. This study determined the antioxidant capacity of the Spanish Mediterranean diet including for the first time both soluble and macromolecular antioxidants. Antioxidant capacity and consumption data of the 54 most consumed plant foods and beverages were used. Results showed that macromolecular antioxidants are the major dietary antioxidants, contributing a 61  % to the diet antioxidant capacity (8000  μmol Trolox, determined by ABTS method). The antioxidant capacity data for foods and beverages provided here may be used to estimate the dietary antioxidant capacity in different populations, where similar contributions of macromolecular antioxidants may be expected, and also to design antioxidant-rich diets. Including macromolecular antioxidants in mechanistic, intervention and observational studies on dietary antioxidants may contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the role of antioxidants in nutrition and health.

40|$|For decades guaco {{species have}} been empirically used for the {{treatment}} of respiratory diseases. However, {{studies have shown that the}} toxic and therapeutic effects of the main guaco metabolites are dose-dependent, and none clinical study was done to evaluate the behavior of these substances in humans. In this work, a pilot study measuring the kinetic profile of the main guaco metabolites was performed leading to the knowledge of an alternative route of coumarin metabolism in humans. Initial screenings demonstrated that the administration of 60 mL of guaco syrup (single dose) did not provide sufficient levels of coumarin (COU), 7 -hydroxycoumarin (7 -HCOU), o-coumaric acid (OCA) and kaurenoic acid (KAU). The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by orally administering 60 mL of guaco syrup spiked with 1500 mg of COU. The kinetic study demonstrated that the plasmatic levels of 7 -HCOU (considered the main metabolite of COU) were 10 times lower than the levels of COU, and the kinetic profile of 7 -HCOU suggests sequential metabolism in the liver with low access of 7 -HCOU to the systemic circulation. The study also demonstrated that OCA is one of the main <b>bioavailable</b> <b>metabolites</b> of COU. Therefore, the hydrolysis of the lactone ring forming a carboxylated compound is one of the possible routes of COU metabolism in humans. The half-lives of COU, 7 -HCOU and OCA were approximately 4. 0, 1. 0 and 3. 0 h, respectively and there was evidence that the recommended dosage of guaco syrup did not provide sufficient levels of COU, 7 -HCOU or OCA to obtain a bronchodilation effect. Clinical studies are necessary to prove the efficacy and safety of products based on guaco...|$|R

40|$|Ebselen (2 -phenyl- 1, 2 -benzisoselenazol- 3 (2 H) -one; PZ- 51, DR- 3305), is an organoselenium {{compound}} with {{glutathione peroxidase}} (GPx) -like, thiol-dependent, hydroperoxide reducing activity. As an enzyme mimic for {{activity of the}} selenoenzyme GPx, this compound {{has proved to be}} highly useful in research on mechanisms in redox biology. Furthermore, the reactivity of ebselen with protein thiols has helped to identify novel, selective targets for inhibitory actions on several enzymes of importance in pharmacology and toxicology.

As a consequence, initial concerns about selenium toxicity, fortunately, were unfounded. Potential applications in medical settings have been explored, notably in brain ischemia and stroke. More recently, there has been a surge in interest as new medical applications have been taken into consideration. The first publication on the biochemical effects of ebselen appeared 30 years ago (Müller et al. [4]), which prompted the authors to retrace the early development from their perspective. It is a fascinating example of fruitful interaction between research-oriented industry and academia...|$|R

Nevertheless; some of them have been classified as persistent toxic chemicals. This has resulted in serious concern about environmental contamination. Once a pesticide or toxic chemical find its way in the environment, a major part of it comes in contact with soil. There are several possible sources of pesticide contamination; at manufacturing, storage, or user sites. The most serious examples of pesticide contamination are typically the result of poor production and waste management practices of pesticide manufacturing, formulation, and application facilities. Improper storage, handling, and also have resulted in pesticide contamination at these sites and at landfills. Today, many remediation technologies are used to remove the pesticides from the soil. One of the soil treatment methods is enhanced biodegradation. Bioremediation of the soil has often proven to be a cheap solution for contaminated soil problem. This research was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of biologically produced surfactants (biosurfactants) on the biodegradation of pesticide-contaminated soil and evaluate the potential for biosurfactant-enhanced bioavailability of pesticide in soil. In order to determine the effectiveness of biosurfactants on pesticides, sophorolipid and rhamnolipid type biosurfactants were used. These biosurfactants were chosen since they are well characterized and their stimulating effect on the biodegradation of hydrophobic substrates was described in the literature. In this study, endosulfan and trifluralin were selected as pesticides. The study was performed in two stages in laboratory conditions. In the first part of the experiment, degradation of endosulfan-contaminated soil was studied by the presence of sophorolipid and in the second part of the experiment; rhamnolipid (JBR 425) was used on the removal of trifluralin-contaminated soil. Throughout the experiment, three different concentrations of sophorolipid and rhamnolipid were applied to soil which, are 0. 98, 9. 75 and 195 ppm for sophorolipid and 1. 6, 100 and 1000 ppm for rhamnolipid. The effectiveness of synthetic or microbial surfactants on biodegradation of chemicals has been investigated by many researchers. However, studies about the biosurfactant enhanced soil remediation for the pesticide contaminants are limited. Besides that, the outcome of surfactant applications has been highly system-specific, conflicting results reported in the literature. Therefore, despite the general trends outlined in literature, the effect of biosurfactants on the biodegradation of organic compounds is poorly understood. Opposed effects are frequently observed. This study is the first M. Sc. thesis study about the use of biosurfactant enhanced bioremediation of pesticides in Turkey. The results from first part of our study obtained from sophorolipid, were not satisfactory since the degradation patterns for endosulfan were not affected by the presence of sophorolipid. According to the second experiment results, removal of trifluralin ranged from 24 - 35 %, with the increase in rhamnolipid concentrations. Addition of rhamnolipid (JBR 425) into the soil was found to increase the degradation rate of trifluralin by 13 % as compared to the control soil column. Additional time would probably increase the rate of degradation and bioavailability, as a result of providing the adaptation of microorganisms in contaminated soil media and formation of more <b>bioavailable</b> <b>metabolites...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} pesticide mixtures on degradation patterns of parent compounds as well as effects on soil microbial respiration. Bioavailability of residues to sensitive plant species was also determined. Soil for this study was obtained from a pesticide‐contaminated area within an agrochemical dealer site. Degradation patterns were not affected by the presence or absence of other herbicides in this study. Atrazine concentrations were significantly lower at 21 through 160 days aging time compared to day 0 concentrations. Metolachlor and pendimethalin concentrations were not significantly different over time and remained high throughout the study. Microbial respiration was suppressed in treated soils from day 21 to day 160. Soybean and canola were the most successful plant species in the germination and survival tests. Generally, with increased aging of pesticides in soil, germination time decreased. Survival time of plants increased over time for some treatments indicating possible decreased bioavailability of pesticide residues. In some cases, survival time decreased at the longer 160 ‐day aging period, possibly indicating a change in bioavailability, perhaps as the result of formation of more <b>bioavailable</b> and phytotoxic <b>metabolites.</b> No interactive effects were noted for mixtures of pesticides compared to individually applied pesticides in terms of degradation of the parent compound or on seed germination, plant survival, or microbial respiration...|$|R

Method: Fourteen phenolic acid metabolites and 6 flavonoids were screened at 1 μM for their relative effects on sVCAM- 1 secretion by human umbilical vein endothelial cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). The active metabolites were further studied for their response at different concentrations (0. 01 μM– 100 μM), structure-activity relationships, and effect on vascular cellular adhesion molecule (VCAM) - 1 mRNA expression. In addition, the additive activity of the metabolites and flavonoids was investigated by screening 25 unique mixtures at cumulative equimolar concentrations of 1 μM. Results: Of the 20 compounds screened at 1 μM, inhibition of sVCAM- 1 secretion was elicited by 4 phenolic metabolites, of which protocatechuic acid (PCA) was the most active (− 17. 2 %, P = 0. 05). Investigations into their responses at different concentrations showed that PCA significantly reduced sVCAM- 1 15. 2 – 36. 5 % between 1 and 100 μM, protocatechuic acid- 3 -sulfate and isovanillic acid reduced sVCAM- 1 levels 12. 2 – 54. 7 % between 10 and 100 μM, and protocatechuic acid- 4 -sulfate and isovanillic acid- 3 -glucuronide reduced sVCAM- 1 secretion 27. 6 % and 42. 8 %, respectively, only at 100 μM. PCA demonstrated the strongest protein response and was therefore explored for its effect on VCAM- 1 mRNA, where 78. 4 % inhibition was observed only after treatment with 100 μM PCA.
