25|$|Fractional Fourier {{transform}} {{can be used}} in {{time frequency}} analysis and DSP. It is useful to filter noise, but with the condition that it does not overlap with the desired signal in the time–frequency domain. Consider the following example. We cannot apply a filter directly to eliminate the noise, but {{with the help of the}} fractional Fourier transform, we can rotate the signal (including the desired signal and noise) first. We then apply a specific filter, which will allow only the desired signal to pass. Thus the noise will be removed completely. Then we use the fractional Fourier transform again to rotate the signal <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> can get the desired signal.|$|E

What fun she was." [...] Novelist Hervey Allen called Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Muir, [...] "the Stewart Avenue Gang". The two were fond of having sherry together and gossiping, but those moments were followed by serious talk {{of the future of}} libraries, and {{the role of women in}} South Florida. They were confidants, and often shared their work with one another. Douglas never learned to drive and never owned a car. Her house also had no air conditioning, electric stove, or dishwasher.|$|E

500|$|To {{celebrate}} {{ten years}} as a band, Godsmack released a greatest hits album entitled Good Times, Bad Times... Ten Years of Godsmack on , 2007. The album debuted at number thirty-five on the Billboard 200, selling 40,000 copies {{in the first week}} of release. It includes a cover of the Led Zeppelin song [...] "Good Times Bad Times", as well as a DVD of Godsmack's acoustic performance in Las Vegas at House of Blues. The album was originally intended to be a boxed set, but the band scrapped the plans so they could release a best of album. Godsmack will follow the release of the album with an acoustic tour. [...] Despite rumors of the band going on hiatus as a result of releasing a greatest hits album, Erna was quoted as saying, [...] "we're not going away, we are just gonna take a break and enjoy our 10th year anniversary and kind of recharge our batteries. And then Godsmack will be <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> will come back bigger and badder than ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E

[...] Ba Thanh, the guerrilla killed while carrying the B-40 rocket launcher, was [...] "big and strong" [...] {{and in his}} late 20's. [...] Return fire was also intense, according to Vo Van Tam, who was then a local Viet Cong commander: [...] "I led Ba Thanh's comrades, the whole unit, to fight <b>back.</b> <b>And</b> <b>we</b> ran around the back and fought the Americans from behind. We worked with the city soldiers to fire on the American boats." [...] No Vietnamese witnesses saw how Thanh died or saw him being chased by an American.|$|E
2500|$|Morris {{played at}} Michigan under head coach Bo Schembechler. [...] When Morris first arrived at Michigan, Schembechler told Morris (who stood five feet, seven inches) {{he was too}} short to play at running back. [...] Schembechler recalled: [...] "I told Jamie when we {{recruited}} him he {{was too small to}} be a running <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> wanted him for running back kicks. I did, however, promise him the chance to try to be a running back for us. Good thing I did, isn't it?" [...] In his third game as a freshman, Schembechler put him in as the starting tailback, and he remained Michigan's starter at the position for four years.|$|E
2500|$|... "We knew {{we could}} have played better in that Test [...] The {{fact that we had}} got so close to the Blacks proved we were close to them in ability, and {{when it came to the}} third Test in Wellington, we had a sense of giving {{everything}} to salvage our reputation. New Zealand had not won a Test match against Australia in Wellington since 1982. Not so long ago, you might think, but let me tell you, that is a lifetime by New Zealand's standards. And what happened that day really angered me. We played as though our lives depended on it; we tackled them as though they were demons; we knocked them <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> kept at them, mercilessly hounding them when they had possession and flattening them in some shuddering tackles. Not surprisingly, it won us the Test, but immediately apparent was the question: why the hell hadn't we played like that in the first two Tests?" ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{remember}} Maurice Garin well. I met him {{and talked}} to him almost every day because {{we lived in the}} same area, 200m from each other, at Lens. Le Père Garin, as my father and grandfather called him used to bring out a chair in fine weather and sit {{in the doorway of the}} little office of the service station he owned at 116 rue de Lille in [...] Lens, under the sign for Antar fuel and oil. My barber was in the neighbouring house and I used to go there once a month to have a crew cut, [...] which was the fashion in those days. My friends and I were aged seven to ten and on our one-speed bikes we used to pin numbers on our <b>back...</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> never missed riding past Maurice Garin in a tight group so that he would see. It's strange that nobody thought to take a picture of me, the little kid, alongside the first great champion of the biggest race in the world. But life's like that.|$|E
2500|$|Following the reveal of Yungoos at E3 2016, {{many social}} media users quickly {{compared}} the Pokémon to then United States presidential candidate Donald Trump. The Pokémon's appearance and demeanor {{is said to}} resemble Trump, particularly the hair on top of its head which resembles Trump's hairstyle. The resemblance led to numerous memes on the subject, including [...] "Make Alola Great Again", a play on Trump's campaign slogan [...] "Make America Great Again". Others likened Yungoos to former London Mayor Boris Johnson. Junichi Masuda, composer and director for the Pokémon franchise, denied any claims that Yungoos and Gumshoos drew any inspiration from Trump, [...] "we had started the design of this Pokémon a long time <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> didn’t have any intention {{to make it look}} like Donald Trump." [...] Following the release of Sun and Moon, numerous players sent and received Yungoos nicknamed [...] "Donald Trump", [...] "Trump", [...] "Drumpf", etc. through the game's Wonder Trade system. Gita Jackson of Kotaku Australia surmised players were attempting to mock Trump by sending these nicknamed Pokémon out.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{themselves}} {{were far from}} happy with the album and upon its release, were vocal in press interviews about their dissatisfaction. [...] Even two years later, Clarence White complained to journalist Pete Frame that [...] "Terry Melcher put strings on while {{we were on the}} road, we came <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> didn't even recognize it as our own album." [...] Gene Parsons disowned the album completely, describing it as [...] "Melcher's folly" [...] and commenting in interviews that the band were all appalled by what they heard when they returned from touring. [...] McGuinn actually defended Melcher somewhat by indicating {{in an interview with the}} English journalist Keith Altham that the album had been taken away from the producer at the last minute and given to an engineer in San Francisco to remix. [...] However, the production credits on the original LP sleeve do not support McGuinn's claim and Melcher later stated that he had no recollection of the album being mixed by anyone other than himself. [...] In more recent years, McGuinn has conceded to journalist David Fricke that the album's shortcomings were not down to Melcher's over-production alone: [...] "We were just idling artistically, the album sounds like we really weren't concentrating on doing good work, good art." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early January 2013, Willie Frazer {{said that}} he and a group of loyalists planned to hold a protest outside the Irish {{parliament}} building, Leinster House, in Dublin and [...] "sarcastically" [...] ask for the Irish flag to be taken down. Frazer said [...] "it's a tongue-in-cheek gesture. It's to give Irish people a sense of how we feel. I would be very offended if I was living in Ireland and someone came and asked me to take the flag down. That’s exactly how we feel in Belfast. People keep telling us we're still part of the UK, yet here we are without a flag". In 2006, a march in Dublin, organised by Love Ulster, had sparked riots. The Progressive Unionist Party's Billy Hutchinson condemned the clashes, while his colleague, Phil Hamilton, criticised the PSNI for not deploying enough officers to the Short Strand area on 12 January to prevent violence. The UDA's Jimmy Birch told the BBCs Radio Ulster: [...] "Every time they call a tune, we take to the streets. We are wrecking our own areas, we fight with the police, we are burning our own cars and we stop our own people going to work and disrupt our own people's way of life. It is wrong, we need to step <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> need to stop being predictable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Salli Frattini, the {{executive}} producer for MTV who had planned the entire performance, recalled {{a phone call from}} the officiating booth that was her first indication something had gone wrong. Frattini was in a truck outside of Reliant Stadium celebrating the end of the 12-minute halftime performance, which they initially thought was a success. [...] "We were like, 'Uh, we’re playing that back right now'", Frattini said. [...] "There was lots of chaos in the truck, and we played it <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were like, 'Oh, s. What just happened?'" [...] Alex Coletti, another MTV producer, said he could not find Jackson after the performance. [...] "I tried to get in touch to make sure she was okay", he said. [...] "Her entire camp stopped answering the phones. I finally got to her tour manager, and they were already at the airport." [...] Coletti assumed the singer was so mortified that she fled immediately, though later assumed the incident was a possible [...] "set up", adding it was the last time he had spoken to her. Coletti's assumption is potentially another reason for Jackson's blacklisting on MTV in addition to other music channels and radio formats. An MTV representative confirmed the costume tear was conceptualized by the MTV staff, in which the show's producers mockingly ripped their clothing in response to Timberlake's closing lyric during rehearsals. This led to Jackson and Timberlake improvising the move, in which Timberlake tore off Jackson's kilt. Frattini stated, [...] "When we did the original rehearsal, there was conversation about a fake skirt she would wear, and that Justin would actually pull open the skirt and take off the skirt. In rehearsal, they actually tried to rip open the skirt, which kind of went with the lyrics of the song". The production team then discussed another option, which led to the costume tearing, although the outfit was intended to stay in place.|$|E
