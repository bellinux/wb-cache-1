5|$|Piperazine-based stimulants <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> Europe in 2000 but {{remained}} virtually unavailable {{in the rest}} of the world until recently. In early 2006, pills containing the active ingredients BZP and TFMPP <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where they first gained popularity with late night party-goers as a purported safer alternative to many of the illicit street drugs commonly available there. In 2007 piperazine based party-pill formulations started to become widely available nationwide which has caused concern with local authorities such as Health Canada and subsequently BZP has gained much media attention in 2008. In the United States, it is still used as an adulterant in ecstasy mimic tablets.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic {{activity}} increased {{again in}} November 1985 as magma neared the surface. Increasing quantities of gases rich in sulfur dioxide and elemental sulfur <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the volcano. The water {{content of the}} fumaroles' gases decreased, and water springs {{in the vicinity of}} Nevado del Ruiz became enriched with magnesium, calcium and potassium, leached from the magma.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} the highway was completed, the federal {{government}} began to promote suburbanization by moving several federal agencies out of the capital {{in order to protect}} them against nuclear attack. As a result, suburban neighborhoods <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> Laurel, Severn, Bowie, and Greenbelt. In addition, the road became a prime commuting route into both Washington and Baltimore, leading to suburban growth that would eventually cause the two distinct cities to merge into one large metropolitan area.|$|E

The federal religious census recorded 85,717 Christian Scientists in 1906; 30 years later it was 268,915. In 1890 there were seven Christian Science churches in the United States, a figure that had risen to 1,104 by 1910. Churches <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> other countries too: 58 in England, 38 in Canada and 28 elsewhere by 1910.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1800s, a number of mills were built on tributaries of the creek. A number of other industries were established in the watershed in the early 1800s, including a sawmill, a woolen mill, an iron furnace, and a tannery. In {{the second half of the}} 1800s, railroads began to be built in the watershed. Heavy industries and fisheries also <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the area around this time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, Neoclassical {{architectural}} elements <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the federal style row homes, such as iconic columns in the porticoes and classic motifs over doorways and windows. Many Federal-style row houses were modernized by placing a Greek-style porch at the front.

The first significant publication discussing Marcinkus in Soviet Lithuania appeared in a 1967 {{issue of the journal}} Švytūrys. Thereinafter Marcinkus's life was more frequently mentioned, although much of the information presented was inaccurate and incomplete.|$|E
5|$|Specialized bulk {{carriers}} {{began to appear}} as steam-powered ships became more popular. The first steam ship recognized as a bulk carrier was the British coal carrier SS John Bowes in 1852. She featured a metal hull, a steam engine, and a ballasting system which used seawater instead of sandbags. These features helped her succeed in the competitive British coal market. The first self-unloader was the lake freighter Hennepin in 1902 on the Great Lakes. This greatly decreased the unloading time of bulkers by using conveyor belt to move the cargo. The first bulkers with diesel propulsion <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> 1911.|$|E

The evolution of multicellularity occurred in multiple independent events, in organisms as diverse as sponges, brown algae, cyanobacteria, slime moulds and myxobacteria. In January 2016, scientists reported that, about 800 million years ago, a minor genetic change in a single molecule called GK-PID may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells.|$|E

5|$|The libel trial {{became a}} cause célèbre as salacious details of Wilde's private life with Taylor and Douglas <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the press. A team of private detectives had {{directed}} Queensberry's lawyers, led by Edward Carson QC, {{to the world}} of the Victorian underground. Wilde's association with blackmailers and male prostitutes, cross-dressers and homosexual brothels was recorded, and various persons involved were interviewed, some being coerced to appear as witnesses since they too were accomplices to the crimes of which Wilde was accused.|$|E
5|$|Writings {{about the}} theory of how to play chess <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the 15thcentury. The Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez (Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess) by Spanish churchman Luis Ramirez de Lucena was {{published}} in Salamanca in 1497. Lucena and later masters like Portuguese Pedro Damiano, Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona, Giulio Cesare Polerio and Gioachino Greco, and Spanish bishop Ruy López de Segura developed elements of openings and started to analyze simple endgames.|$|E
5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques for farming <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> England in the mid-17th century, from {{writers such as}} Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place {{for a long time}} was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Argentina from Europe, Evita never again appeared in public with the complicated hairdos of her movie star days. The brilliant gold color became more subdued in tone, {{and even the}} style changed, her hair being pulled back severely into a heavy braided chignon. Additionally, her extravagant clothing became more refined after the tour. No longer did she wear the elaborate hats and form-fitting dresses of Argentine designers. Soon she adopted simpler and more fashionable Paris couture and became particularly attached to the fashions of Christian Dior and the jewels of Cartier. In an attempt to cultivate a more serious political persona, Eva <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> public wearing conservative though stylish tailleurs (a business-like combination of skirts and jackets), which also were made by Dior and other Paris couture houses.|$|E
5|$|Bamber first sought {{leave to}} appeal in November 1986, arguing that the judge had {{misdirected}} the jury. The application was heard and refused by a single judge in April 1988. Bamber's lawyer requested a full hearing before three judges, arguing that the trial judge's summing up had been biased against Bamber, that his language had been too forceful, {{and that he had}} undermined the defence by advancing his own theory. The lawyer also argued that the defence had not pressed Julie Mugford about her dealings with the media, but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> newspapers. The judges rejected the application in March 1989.|$|E
5|$|Commercial artist Russell H. Tandy was {{the first}} artist to {{illustrate}} Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style {{is that of a}} flatfoot flapper: heeled Mary Janes accompany her blue flapper skirt suit and cloche hat on three of the first four volume dust jackets. As styles changed over the next few years, Nancy <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, gloves, and handbags. By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; her hair was often arranged in a pompadour. In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.|$|E
