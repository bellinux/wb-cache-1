5|$|In August 2015, Apple {{admitted}} that some iPhone 6 Plus may have faulty cameras {{that could be}} causing photos to look <b>blurry</b> and initiated a replacement program.|$|E
5|$|On August 21, 2015, Apple {{instituted a}} repair program for iPhone 6 Plus models {{released}} between September 2014 and January 2015, citing that faulty rear cameras on affected models may produce <b>blurry</b> pictures.|$|E
5|$|Apart from headache, about 50% of {{patients}} experience neck pain or stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms include dizziness and vertigo, facial numbness or weakness, unusually <b>blurry</b> or double vision, neuralgia, fatigue, or a metallic taste in the mouth. Leaking CSF {{can sometimes be}} felt or observed as a discharge from the nose or ear.|$|E
5|$|Lyrically {{the songs}} {{reflected}} the band members' experiences {{growing up in}} Belleville. Farrar and Tweedy romanticized tales about unemployment, alcoholism, and the feeling {{of living in a}} small town in an effort to emulate the profundity of songwriters such as Woody Guthrie. Musically, No Depression was influenced by the start-stop musical pattern of the Minutemen. The cover of the album features a <b>blurry</b> photo of the band, taken by J. Hamilton, reminiscent of the albums released on Folkways Records.|$|E
5|$|Melissa Perrine {{was born}} in Nowra, New South Wales, on 21 February 1988. In 2007, the Wingecarribee Council area named her their Young Australian of the Year. She was {{featured}} on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's X Paralympic Games in March 2010. She has a vision impairment, with her eyesight slowly deteriorating since she was very young. Her vision is limited to <b>blurry</b> shapes and colours. , she lives in Welby, New South Wales, and is studying Exercise Science at the Australian Catholic University in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|The silent {{film was}} shot in black and white; its intertitles were bilingual, written in both Malay and Chinese. The American film {{historian}} Richard Abel writes that the film's technical quality, like all other local productions of the time, was poor and unable to compete with imported works, and the Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran writes that the shots were considered <b>blurry</b> even at the time.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the telerecorded material, some early 1970s material survives only, or in colour only, on NTSC videotapes produced for North American transmission (e.g., TV Ontario and CKVU in Vancouver). NTSC runs at a different framerate than PAL video, and has a different number of scanlines. The conversion process used in the 1970s was primitive by modern standards, resulting in a noticeable amount of picture and motion loss. Converting the NTSC tapes back to PAL introduces more artifacts, creating a <b>blurry</b> picture and juddering motion. To rectify the problem, in 2005 a new Reverse Standards Conversion process, which attempts to unpick the original video conversion, was introduced for the DVD release of The Claws of Axos.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{determine}} {{that one of}} the dead men belonged to an Islamic terrorist group, the Isfahan, and using the ATM video are able to track down Lauren. A screenshot of the video reveals a <b>blurry</b> figure who appears to be Howard Graves. The agents meet with Lauren at her home and after initially denying it, she admits to the incident but knows nothing about the murders. Upon leaving, the agents find their car going out of control on its own, leading it to crash into another car. At a repair shop, the car is found to have no evidence of tampering, but an electrical charge is detected within it.|$|E
5|$|The carvings at {{the east}} {{entrance}} are battered and <b>blurry.</b> One in {{the southeast corner of}} the mandapa (see 2 on plan) depicts Shiva and Parvati in Mount Kailash in the Himalayas, and the shows the Umamaheshvara story. The scene includes rocky terrain and clouds layered horizontally. On top of a rock sit the four-armed Shiva and Parvati by his side. Nandi stands below her, while celestial apsaras float on the clouds above. There are traces of a crown and a disc behind Shiva, but it is all damaged. The scene is crowded with accessory figures, which may be because the eastern entrance was meant to have a devotional focus.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} opens with several shots of a dining table; it {{includes}} uneaten sweets, foods, and small pink bird ornaments. The first verse features close-ups {{of the girls}} singing and dancing to the song, {{in front of a}} beige backdrop. The chorus section has three scenes of each member; Kashiyuka is seen laying down with an electronics cable in her hand; Nocchi is seen at the dining table; and A-Chan is seen under a table with a cable telephone. During the instrumental break, close-up shots (yet very <b>blurry)</b> features a fish bowl that have small fishing swimming around. The second verse repeats the first verses video shoots.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. It opens with Hamasaki watching her previous music videos on several television screens. Sitting in a small room, she exits it and finds {{a large amount of}} fans and paparazzi bombarding her; scenes interspersed through the main plot feature her looking towards a mirror. Following the first chorus, Hamasaki is shown riding through Tokyo city, including her appearance at a recording studio singing the song, and on top of a skyscraper at night. The frames subsequently re-appear throughout the visual, with it ending with a <b>blurry</b> shot of Hamasaki looking away from the mirror, and the TV screens from the first shot displaying the logo of Avex Trax. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016). It was additionally used as the theme for Japanese television show Semi Double (1999).|$|E
5|$|On 14 February 2013, a <b>blurry</b> {{screenshot}} of {{the game}} was released by Avalanche Studios founder and CEO Christofer Sundberg. The game was announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013 on 10 June at Sony's press conference, with a scheduled 2014 release for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. Although Sundberg said during the expo that Miller and Barlog's project was not the Mad Max game announced by Avalanche, he later said that Barlog had worked on a Mad Max game at Avalanche. Despite the unclear relationship between the projects, according to the game's design director, Miller had collaborated with Avalanche during the game's pre-production in mid-2011. Despite having Miller to offer input, Warner Bros. inclined to give lots of creative freedom to Avalanche. Full production {{of the game}} began before May 2012.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{facing the}} Mount Kailash panel towards the {{northeast}} corner (see 1 on plan) depicts demon king Ravana trying to lift Kailash and bother Shiva, a legend called Ravananugraha. The upper scene is Mount Kailash, where Shiva and Parvati are seated. Shiva is recognizable with a crown, and other characters are badly damaged. A portion of ascetic skeletal devotee Bhringi relief survives and he is seated near Shiva's feet. Near Shiva an outline of {{what may have been}} Ganesha and Kartikeya are visible. Below the mountain surface is shown the demon-king Ravana is seen with a few arms, trying to unsuccessfully shake Shiva and Parvati in Mount Kailash. The rest of the details are <b>blurry</b> and speculative. According to Charles Collins, the discernible elements of this panel are generally consistent with those in medieval era Puranas, though there is a lack in literal correspondence with any single text.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreckage}} was too severely fragmented {{to determine}} the exact position of the rudders, elevators, flaps, and slats before impact and examination of eyewitness photographs showed only that the right wing slats were fully extended as the crew tried unsuccessfully to correct the steep roll they were in. The left wing slats could not be determined from the <b>blurry</b> color photographs, so they were sent to a laboratory in Palo Alto, California for digital analysis, a process that was pushing the limits of 1970s technology and necessitated large, complicated, and expensive equipment. The photographs were reduced to black-and-white, which {{made it possible to}} distinguish the slats from the wing itself and thus proved that they were retracted. In addition, it was also verified that the tail section of the aircraft was undamaged and the landing gear was down.|$|E
25|$|On August 6, 2008, the Enquirer {{published}} a <b>blurry</b> photo that allegedly portrayed Edwards holding Hunter's baby.|$|E
25|$|Many {{side effects}} {{may be related}} to the antimuscarinic {{properties}} of the TCAs. Such side effects are relatively common and may include dry mouth, dry nose, <b>blurry</b> vision, lowered gastrointestinal motility or constipation, urinary retention, cognitive and/or memory impairment, and increased body temperature.|$|E
25|$|The way {{contact lenses}} {{interact}} with the natural tear layer {{is a major factor}} in determining lens comfort and visual clarity. People suffering from dry eyes are particularly vulnerable to discomfort and episodes of brief <b>blurry</b> vision. Proper lens selection can minimize these effects.|$|E
25|$|Keratoconus (KC) is a {{disorder}} {{of the eye}} which results in progressive thinning of the cornea. This may result in <b>blurry</b> vision, double vision, nearsightedness, astigmatism, and light sensitivity. Usually both eyes are affected. In more severe cases a scarring or a circle may be seen within the cornea.|$|E
25|$|Near-sightedness, {{also known}} as {{short-sightedness}} and myopia, is a condition of the eye where light focuses in front of, instead of on, the retina. This causes distant objects to be <b>blurry</b> while close objects appear normal. Other symptoms may include headaches and eye strain. Severe near-sightedness {{increases the risk of}} retinal detachment, cataracts, and glaucoma.|$|E
25|$|Close {{examination}} of affected features {{show that the}} doubling is extremely irregular. This is because the coin metal does not flow from just one direction, but flows and produces wear on the die from all sides. There is no definite shape, and it can take on several different but similar appearances. It often looks like a thin metal shelf or spreading spot. It can also make lettering appear thick and twisted. There are no crisp lines affected, but things generally look bloated, enlarged, <b>blurry,</b> twisted, and damaged. This is different from hub doubling, because hub doubling appears as a crisp secondary image, rotated minutely from the original. When casually glancing at a coin, the difference {{is not easy to}} tell, but when magnified, the difference is obvious on most coins. Another easy way to tell hub doubling from die deterioration doubling is the presence of notched serifs; the small flairs on the ends of letters will appear distinctly separated with the former, whereas they appear just <b>blurry</b> and washed out with the latter.|$|E
25|$|Before {{computer}} graphics could be employed, mechanical methods {{were used to}} fit large molecules to their electron density maps. Using techniques of X-ray crystallography crystal of a substance were bombarded with X-rays, and the diffracted beams that came off were assembled by computer using a Fourier transform into a usually <b>blurry</b> 3-D image of the molecule, made visible by drawing contour circles around high electron density to produce a contoured electron density map.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his work, Tricky blurs the {{normally}} clear sexual definitions found within hip hop. Despite the heavy influence he drew from American hip hop in his debut album, Maxinquaye, he fights against typical sexual representations by, for example, dressing {{as a woman}} on the side sleeve of his album cover. As many of his tracks blend elements of varying types of music creating a difficult to define sound, so go his lyrics, creating a more ambiguous and <b>blurry</b> take on sexuality.|$|E
25|$|On April 29, 1992, {{the seventh}} day of jury deliberations, the jury acquitted all four {{officers}} of assault and acquitted {{three of the four}} of using excessive force. The jury could not agree on a verdict for the fourth officer charged with using excessive force. The verdicts were based in part on the first three seconds of a <b>blurry,</b> 13-second segment of the videotape that, according to journalist Lou Cannon, was edited out by television news stations in their broadcasts.|$|E
25|$|The {{failure of}} {{assimilation}} of Muslim immigrants communities in Europe together with {{economic and social}} problems {{and the spread of}} fundamentalist ideas among the Muslim youth in Europe has led to radicalization inside the Muslim communities and especially among the youth. This, together with the escalation of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict and the failure of the Oslo peace process, the Jews in Europe were more and more perceived as promoters and favorers of pro-Israeli ideas. Thus, the line that exists between antisemitism and anti-Zionism sometimes became <b>blurry.</b>|$|E
25|$|Surface {{roughness}} {{determines how}} much of the reflection is specular and how much diffuses, controlling how sharp or <b>blurry</b> the image will be. For perfectly specular reflection, the surface roughness must be kept smaller than the wavelength of the light. Microwaves, which sometimes have a wavelength greater than an inch (2.5 cm) can reflect specularly off a metal screen-door, while visible light, having wavelengths of only a few hundred nanometers (a few millionths of an inch), must meet a very smooth surface to produce specular reflection.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between God's absolute Unity and Divine manifestations, may {{be compared to}} a man in a room - there is the man himself, and his presence and relationship to others in the room. In Hebrew, this is known as the Shekhinah. It is also the concept of God's Name - it is His relationship and presence in the world towards us. The Wisdom (literally written as Field of Apples) in kabbalistic terms refers to the Shekhinah, the Divine Presence. The Unknowable One (literally written as the Miniature Presence) refers to events on earth when events can be understood as natural happenings instead of God's act, although it is actually the act of God. This is known as perceiving the Shekhinah through a <b>blurry,</b> cloudy lens. This means to say, although we see God's Presence (not God Himself) through natural occurrences, it is only through a <b>blurry</b> lens; as opposed to miracles, in which we clearly see and recognize God's presence in the world. The Holy Ancient One refers to God Himself, Who is imperceivable. (see Minchas Yaakov and anonymous commentary in the Siddur Beis Yaakov on the Sabbath hymn of Askinu Seudasa, composed by the Arizal based on this lofty concept of the Zohar).|$|E
25|$|ZombiU {{technical}} performance was criticized. Sterling compared its graphics to a Wii title and noted technical flaws, including glitches and slow loading times. He and Stanton thought {{that some of}} the game's assets were used excessively. Turi severely criticized the game's lighting system, saying that it looked <b>blurry</b> even given its nighttime setting. Miller also noted the game's sub-par texture, and was disappointed by its lack of visual appeal. Turi and Gies noted the difficulty of dragging items with the GamePad, but Gies thought it added tension to the game.|$|E
25|$|A {{cataract}} is a clouding of {{the lens}} in the eye {{which leads to a}} decrease in vision. Cataracts often develop slowly and can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms may include faded colors, <b>blurry</b> vision, halos around light, trouble with bright lights, and trouble seeing at night. This may result in trouble driving, reading, or recognizing faces. Poor vision caused by cataracts may also result in an increased risk of falling and depression. Cataracts are the cause of half of blindness and 33% of visual impairment worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, when a {{blood vessel}} is {{punctured}} during the tattooing procedure a hematoma (bruise) may appear. Bruises generally heal within one week. Bruises can appear as halos around a tattoo, or, if blood pools, as one larger bruise. This bluish or dark <b>blurry</b> halo that surrounds a tattoo {{can also be}} attributed to ink diffusion or 'blow-out'. Commonly mistaken for a hematoma, this discolouration occurs when tattoo pigments spread out into the subcutaneous tissue beneath the dermal skin layer, and {{may be caused by}} ink being deposited too deep in the skin.|$|E
25|$|Transsaccadic {{memory is}} the neural process that allows humans to {{perceive}} their surroundings as a seamless, unified image despite rapid changes in fixation points. The human eyes move rapidly and repeatedly, {{focusing on a}} single point for only {{a short period of}} time before moving to the next point. These rapid eye movements are called saccades. If a video camera were to perform such high speed changes in focal points, the image on screen would be a <b>blurry,</b> nauseating mess. Despite this rapidly changing input to the visual system, the normal experience is of a stable visual world; an example of perceptual constancy. Transsaccadic memory is a system that contributes to this stability.|$|E
25|$|This slug is {{basically}} dark brownish grey, with a keel of a brighter color. The body is yellowish-grey to brown or dark grey, with numerous black spots, {{so that the}} slug {{may appear to be}} evenly black-brown, slightly lighter at the sides. The animal is very slender, gradually narrowing posteriorly. The mantle length is less than 1/3 of the body length. There are <b>blurry</b> black bands {{on the sides of the}} mantle. The keel is prominent, light, and reaches the mantle. The head and neck are blackish.The sole is narrow and cream with brown or orange hue. The body mucus is usually colourless, thick and sticky but it is yellowish when the slug is irritated.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, at Matthew Marks Gallery in New York, an {{exhibition}} of Twombly's photographs offered a selection of large <b>blurry</b> color images of tulips, trees and ancient busts, based on the artist's Polaroids. In 2008, a specially curated selection of Twombly's photographic work was exhibited in Huis Marseille, the Museum for Photography, Amsterdam; the exhibition was opened by Sally Mann. For the season 2010/2011 in the Vienna State Opera Cy Twombly designed the large scale picture (176 sqm) Bacchus {{as part of the}} exhibition series Safety Curtain, conceived by museum in progress. In 2011, the Museum Brandhorst, mounted a retrospective of Twombly's photographs from 1951 to 2010. It later was passed over to the Museum für Gegenwartskunst at Siegen and the Palais des Beaux Arts, Brussels.|$|E
25|$|Excessive vitamin A {{consumption}} {{can lead}} to nausea, irritability, anorexia (reduced appetite), vomiting, <b>blurry</b> vision, headaches, hair loss, muscle and abdominal pain and weakness, drowsiness, and altered mental status. In chronic cases, hair loss, dry skin, drying of the mucous membranes, fever, insomnia, fatigue, weight loss, bone fractures, anemia, and diarrhea can all be evident {{on top of the}} symptoms associated with less serious toxicity. Some of these symptoms are also common to acne treatment with Isotretinoin. Chronically high doses of vitamin A, and also pharmaceutical retinoids such as 13-cis retinoic acid, can produce the syndrome of pseudotumor cerebri. This syndrome includes headache, blurring of vision and confusion, associated with increased intracerebral pressure. Symptoms begin to resolve when intake of the offending substance is stopped.|$|E
25|$|Before {{using the}} laser, the {{ophthalmologist}} dilates the pupil and applies anaesthetic drops to numb the eye. In some cases, the doctor also may numb the area behind {{the eye to}} reduce discomfort. The patient sits facing the laser machine while the doctor holds a special lens on the eye. The physician can use a single spot laser or a pattern scan laser for two dimensional patterns such as squares, rings and arcs. During the procedure, the patient will see flashes of light. These flashes often create an uncomfortable stinging sensation for the patient. After the laser treatment, patients should be advised not to drive {{for a few hours}} while the pupils are still dilated. Vision will most likely remain <b>blurry</b> {{for the rest of the}} day. Though there should not be much pain in the eye itself, an ice-cream headache like pain may last for hours afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Patient A {{suffers from}} schizophrenia. Their {{treatment}} included {{a combination of}} ziprasidone, olanzapine, trazodone and benzotropine. The patient experienced dizziness and sedation, so they were tapered off ziprasidone and olanzapine, and transition to quetiapine. Trazodone was discontinued. The patient then experienced excessive sweating, tachycardia and neck pain, gained considerable weight and had hallucinations. Five months later, quetiapine was tapered and discontinued, with ziprasidone re-introduction into their treatment due to the excessive weight gain. Although the patient lost the excessive weight they gained, they then developed muscle stiffness, cogwheeling, tremor and night sweats. When benztropine was added they experienced <b>blurry</b> vision. After an additional five months, the patient was switched from ziprasidone to aripiprazole. Over the course of 8 months, patient A gradually experienced more weight gain, sedation, developed difficulty with their gait, stiffness, cogwheel and dyskinetic ocular movements. A pharmacogenomics test later proved the patient had a CYP2D6 *1/*41, with has a predicted phenotype of IM and CYP2C19 *1/*2 with predicted phenotype of IM as well.|$|E
25|$|Samizdat distinguishes itself {{not only}} by the ideas and debates which it helped spread to a wider audience, but also by its {{physical}} form. The hand-typed, often <b>blurry</b> and wrinkled pages with numerous typographical errors and nondescript covers helped to separate and elevate Russian samizdat from Western literature. The physical form of samizdat arose from a simple lack of resources and the necessity to be inconspicuous. In time dissidents in the USSR began to admire these qualities for their own sake, the ragged appearance of samizdat contrasting sharply with the smooth, well-produced appearance of texts passed by the censor's office for publication by the State. The form samizdat took gained precedence over the ideas it expressed, and became a potent symbol of the resourcefulness and rebellious spirit of the inhabitants of the Soviet Union. In effect, the physical form of samizdat itself elevated the reading of samizdat to a prized clandestine act.|$|E
