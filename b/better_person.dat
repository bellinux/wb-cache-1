25|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the study of}} logic in ancient times was clear: it is so that one may learn to distinguish good arguments from bad arguments, and so become more effective in argument and oratory, and perhaps also to become a <b>better</b> <b>person.</b> Half of the works of Aristotle's Organon treat inference as it occurs in an informal setting, {{side by side with the}} development of the syllogistic, and in the Aristotelian school, these informal works on logic were seen as complementary to Aristotle's treatment of rhetoric.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{religious}} tourism phenomenon arouses {{the interest}} of many researchers and practitioners, but few concentrated on the non- religious motivation of religious travelers. Using a questionnaire based on the model, more than 1600 Orthodox people from Romania who visited a monastery {{in the last two}} years were asked to evaluate the non-religious purpose of their visits. The analytical results showed that visitors are mainly motivated by a self-actualization need, namely their desire to become <b>better</b> <b>persons.</b> The paper offers a basis for a new and alternative approach of religious travel and a better understanding of the target market of this special form of tourism gradually on the rise...|$|R
500|$|Descartes' {{argument}} crucially {{depends on}} the premise that what Seth believes to be [...] "clear and distinct" [...] ideas in his mind are necessarily true. Many contemporary philosophers doubt this. For example, Joseph Agassi suggests that several scientific discoveries made since the early 20th century have undermined the idea of privileged access to one's own ideas. Freud claimed that a psychologically-trained observer can understand a person's unconscious motivations <b>better</b> than the <b>person</b> himself does. Duhem has shown that a philosopher of science can know a person's methods of discovery <b>better</b> than that <b>person</b> herself does, while Malinowski has shown that an anthropologist can know a person's customs and habits <b>better</b> than the <b>person</b> whose customs and habits they are. He also asserts that modern psychological experiments that cause people to see things that are not there provide grounds for rejecting Descartes' argument, because scientists can describe a person's perceptions <b>better</b> than the <b>person</b> herself can.|$|R

40|$|Can we {{conceive}} of {{a philosophy of}} technology that is not technophobic, yet takes seriously the problem of alienation and human meaning-giving? This paper retrieves the concern with alienation, but brings it into dialogue with more recent philosophy of technology. It defines and responds {{to the problem of}} alienation in a way that avoids both old-style human-centered approaches and contemporary thing-centered or hybridity approaches. In contrast to the latter, it proposes to reconcile subject and object not at the ontic level but at the ontological, transcendental level and at the level of skilled activity. Taking inspiration from Dreyfus’s reading of Heidegger and engaging critically with the work of Borgmann and Arendt, it explores a phenomenology and ethics of skill. It is concluded that new and emerging technologies must be evaluated not only as artifacts and their consequences, but also in terms of the skills and activities they involve and require. Do they promote engagement with the world and with others, thus making us into <b>better</b> <b>persons...</b>|$|R

500|$|In {{addition}} to the religious themes, the cruel way in which Damien is treated by the other children is a satire on the tendency of schoolchildren to relentlessly pick on new students.

Instead of what a lot of hippies and Democrats think, which is we're born innocent and pure and society corrupts us.
