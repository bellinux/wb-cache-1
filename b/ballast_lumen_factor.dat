40|$|Endoscopic biliary stenting {{is today}} {{the most common}} palliative {{treatment}} for patients suffering from obstructive jaundice associated with malignant hepatobiliary tumors or benign strictures. However, recurrent jaundice, with or without cholangitis, is a major complication of a biliary endoprosthesis insertion. Thus, stent removal and replacement with a new one frequently occurs {{as a consequence of}} device blockage caused by microbial biofilm growth and biliary sludge accumulation in the <b>lumen.</b> <b>Factors</b> and mechanisms involved in plastic stent clogging arising from epidemiological, clinical and experimental data, as well as the possible strategies to prevent biliary stent failure, will be reviewed and discussed. © 2007 Marshfield Clinic...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a comprehensive analysis {{dealing with the}} behaviour and economics of electronic compact fluorescent lamps. The economic analysis, {{based on the results}} of the test concerning the lifetime and the lamp <b>lumen</b> maintenance <b>factor</b> of electronic compact fluorescent lamps, and conducted using the cost-discount method, showed an obvious advantage for lamps of this type compared with incandescent ones. The strategic importance of the mass use of electronic compact fluorescent lamps, as well as serious power quality implications it can cause to the network, are explained in detail. Possible solutions of this problem are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{formation}} of a tubular organ, such as the heart, requires the communication of positional and polarity signals between migratory cells. Key to this process is {{the establishment of a}} new luminal domain on the cell surface, generally from the apical domain of a migratory cell. This domain will also acquire basal properties, as it will produce a luminal extracellular matrix. Integrin receptors are the primary means of cell adhesion and adhesion signaling with the extracellular matrix. Here we characterise the requirement of Integrins in a genetic model of vasculogenesis, the {{formation of}} the heart in Drosophila. Results As with vertebrates, the Drosophila heart arises from lateral mesoderm that migrates medially to meet their contralateral partners, to then assemble a midline vessel. During migration, Integrins are among the first proteins restricted to the presumptive luminal domain of cardioblasts. Integrins are required for normal levels of leading edge membrane motility. Apical accumulation of Integrins is enhanced by Robo, and reciprocally, apicalisation of luminal factors like Slit and Robo requires Integrin function. Integrins may provide a template for the {{formation of a}} lumen by stabilising <b>lumen</b> <b>factors</b> like Robo. Subsequent to migration, Integrin is required for normal cardioblast alignment and lumen formation. This phenotype is most readily modified by other mutations that affect adhesion, such as Talin and extracellular matrix ligands. Conclusion Our findings reveal an instructive role for Integrins in communicating polarising information to cells during migration, and during transition to an epithelial tube structure. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{stimulus}} for the immune response in Crohn's disease is unknown. In each of 19 cases of Crohn's disease evaluated by electron microscopy, epithelial {{cells of the}} ileum contained phagolysosomes with lamellar layers of lipid. These structures, now termed R or reactant bodies, are the proffered antigenic stimulus. They are proposed to be an amalgam of lipid (cholesterol esters, or phospholipids) and bacterial fragments (mycoplasma, mycobacteria or streptococci), which in combination are hypothesized to produce a powerful immunological response analogous to the adjuvant effect. For disease expression to occur, lipids and specific bacterial populations are needed in the bowel <b>lumen.</b> These <b>factors</b> {{may account for the}} success of elemental diets that are low in fat in the treatment of Crohn's disease and for the regional distribution of disease along the intestinal tract...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors {{raise the issue}} of {{automatic}} discrimination of atherosclerotic plaques within an artery lumen based on numerical and statistical thresholding of Computerized Tomography Angiographic (CTA) images and their advanced dimensioning as a support for preoperative vessel assessment. For the study, a set of tomograms of the aorta, as well as the ilio-femoral and femoral arteries were examined. In each case a sequence of about 130 – 480 images of the artery cut-off planes were analyzed prior to their segmentation based on morphological image transformation. A crucial step in the staging of atherosclerotic alteration is recognition of the plaque in the CTA image. To solve this problem, statistical and linear fitting methods, including the least-squares approximation by polynomial and spline polynomial functions, as well as the error fitting function were used. Also, new descriptors of atherosclerotic changes, such as the <b>lumen</b> decrease <b>factor,</b> the circumference occupancy factor, and the convex plaque area factor, are proposed as a means of facilitating preoperative vessel examination. Finally, ways to reduce the computational time are discussed. The proposed methods can be very useful for automatic quantification of atherosclerotic changes visualized by CTA imaging...|$|R
40|$|Background: Some {{patients}} show favorable {{changes in}} the descending aortic false lumen after conventional repair of acute type A dissection, although the incidence of favorable changes {{has been reported to}} be low. We aimed to investigate the incidence of positive postoperative {{changes in the}} false <b>lumen</b> and the <b>factors</b> associated with positive outcomes. Methods: In 63 patients who underwent surgery for type A acute dissection as well as serial computed tomography (CT) scanning, morphological parameters were compared between the preoperative, early postoperative (mean interval, 5. 4 days), and late CT scans (mean interval, 31. 0 months) at three levels of the descending thoracic aorta. Results: In the early postoperative CT images, complete false lumen thrombosis and/or true lumen expansion at the proximal descending aorta was observed in 46...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Atherosclerotic {{disease is}} an {{important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. No previous study has estimated carotid disease prevalence in such patients in Brazil. The aim was to evaluate the prevalence of atherosclerotic plaque in carotid arteries, in SLE patients and controls, and to verify possible associations between risk factors and carotid plaque. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study, at Universidade Federal de São Paulo - Escola Paulista de Medicina. METHODS: Carotid plaque prevalence was assessed by B-mode ultrasound in 82 female SLE patients of mean age 34. 0 years and 62 controls of mean age 35. 7 years. Plaque was defined as a distinct area of hyperechogenicity and/or focal protrusion of the vessel wall into the <b>lumen.</b> Risk <b>factors</b> for coronary disease and SLE-related variables were determined. RESULTS: 50 % of patients and 29 % of controls presented carotid plaque. Older age, longer disease duration, higher Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) score, higher levels of low-density lipoprotein and greater diabetes, obesity, premature ovarian failure and family history of coronary artery disease were found in patients with carotid plaque than in those without plaque. Patients with plaque were younger than controls with plaque. SLE diagnosis, obesity, older age, higher SLICC score and longer disease duration were independent risk factors for carotid plaque. CONCLUSION: Young patients with SLE present higher prevalence of carotid plaque than controls. SLE diagnosis was a significant risk factor for carotid atherosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: A {{gallbladder}} mucocele is the distention of the gallbladder by {{an inappropriate}} accumulation of mucus. Decreased bile flow, decreased gallbladder motility, and altered absorption {{of water from}} the gallbladder <b>lumen</b> are predisposing <b>factors</b> to biliary sludge. However, it {{is more likely to be}} a small part of a complex disease process involving inflammation of the gallbladder wall and changes to the lining of the gallbladder changing the consistency of its secretions. We would like to present a case of mucocele gallbladder operated successfully by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Case report: Herein, we present a case of 46  year old female presenting with symptoms of pain in right hypochondrium with ultrasonographic diagnosis of cholelithiasis undergone successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy with Intraoperative findings of: 1. The length of the gallbladder was measured to be 30  cm. 2. A large stone was impacted at the neck of gallbladder, which was leading to mucocele formation. Conclusion: Mucocele of gallbladder present an important hurdle in successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A habit of calm and slow dissection with precautions should be developed. Clearance of the calot's triangle with limited use of electro cautery should be done before proceeding towards ligation or clip application to various structures...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial and viral infections (exacerbations) are {{particularly}} problematic {{in those with}} underlying respiratory disease, including post-viral infection, asthma, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} and pulmonary fibrosis. Patients experiencing exacerbations tend to be at the more severe end of the disease spectrum and are often difficult to treat. Most of the unmet medical need remains in this patient group. Airway macrophages are one of the first cell populations to encounter airborne pathogens and, in health, exist in a state of reduced responsiveness due to interactions with the respiratory epithelium and specific factors found in the airway <b>lumen.</b> Granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating <b>factor,</b> interleukin- 10, transforming growth factor-β, surfactant proteins and signalling via the CD 200 receptor, for example, all raise the threshold above which airway macrophages can be activated. We highlight that following severe respiratory inflammation, the airspace microenvironment does not automatically re-set to baseline and may leave airway macrophages more restrained than they were at the outset. This excessive restraint is mediated in part by the clearance of apoptotic cells and components of extracellular matrix. This implies that one strategy to combat respiratory exacerbations would be to retune airway macrophage responsiveness to allow earlier bacterial recognition...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis: Light loss {{factors are}} used to help {{lighting}} systems meet quantitative design criteria throughout {{the life of the}} installation, but they also influence energy use. As the light sources currently being specified continue to evolve, it is necessary to reevaluate the methods used in calculating light loss factors, as well as carefully consider the consequences of different product performance attributes. Because of the unique operating characteristics of LEDs and lack of a comprehensive lifetime rating—as well as the problematic relationship between lifetime and lumen maintenance—determining an appropriate lamp <b>lumen</b> depreciation (LLD) <b>factor</b> for LED products is difficult. As a result, a unique solution has been advocated: when quantity of light is an important design consideration, the IES recommends using an LLD of not greater than 0. 70. This method deviates from the typical practice for conventional sources of using the ratio of mean to initial lumen output, and can misrepresent actual performance, increase energy use, and inhibit comparisons between products. This paper discusses the complications related to LLD and LEDs, compares the performance of conventional and LED products, and examines alternatives to a maximum LLD of 0. 70 for LEDs...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} substantiation of {{the features}} of original algorithms for determining the radius of the lumen and the thickness of the vessel wall was provided. The features of using the algorithm for determining the wall thickness in order to calculate other indicators of hemocapillaries were indicated. The original computer software “VesselsMorpho Tools for ImageJ” was developed based on the algorithms mentioned above. It automatically determined a range of metric indicators of blood vessels. The most important among them were: the lumen area, lumen radius and <b>lumen</b> diameter, shape <b>factor</b> of the inner perimeter, total cross-sectional area of the vessel, wall thickness, Kernohan and Vohenvort indices, capillary basement membrane and BV transport zone thickness. This computer program reduces the time and is convenient and easy to use. The user only outlines the internal and external perimeters of BV, the outer contour of the lamina densa (on the electron microscope image of a capillary only) and the program automatically displays all indicators in table format and shows the result of measurements on photographs using different colours. More precise values of morphometric parameters of hemocapillaries of the submandibular gland and blood vessels of the mucous membrane of the urinary bladder being specific for one-year male Wistar rats were obtained. ...|$|R
40|$|Drug-eluting stents {{reside in}} a dynamic fluid {{environment}} where {{the extent to}} which drugs are distributed within the arterial wall is critically modulated by the blood flowing through the arterial <b>lumen.</b> Yet several <b>factors</b> associated with the pulsatile nature of blood flow and their impact on arterial drug deposition have not been fully investigated. We employed an integrated framework comprising bench-top and computational models to explore the factors governing the time-varying fluid dynamic environment within the vasculature and their effects on arterial drug distribution patterns. A custom-designed bench-top framework comprising a model of a single drug-eluting stent strut and a poly-vinyl alcohol-based hydrogel as a model tissue bed simulated fluid flow and drug transport under fully apposed strut settings. Bench-top experiments revealed a relative independence between drug distribution and the factors governing pulsatile flow and these findings were validated with the in silico model. Interestingly, computational models simulating suboptimal deployment settings revealed a complex interplay between arterial drug distribution, Womersley number and the extent of malapposition. In particular, for a stent strut offset from the wall, total drug deposition was sensitive to changes in the pulsatile flow environment, with this dependence increasing with greater wall displacement. Our results indicate that factors governing pulsatile luminal flow on arterial drug deposition should be carefully considered in conjunction with device deployment settings for better utilization of drug-eluting stent therapy.
