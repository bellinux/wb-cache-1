50|$|A Stonemason's hammer, {{also known}} as a <b>Brick</b> <b>Hammer,</b> has one flat {{traditional}} face and a short or long chisel-shaped blade. It can thus be used to chip off edges or small pieces of stone, cut brick or a concrete masonry unit, without using a separate chisel. The chisel blade {{can also be used to}} rapidly cut bricks or cinder blocks.|$|E
50|$|Coins {{enabled the}} player to {{purchase}} decorations, buildings, crops, trees and animals. Horseshoes, {{which could be}} earned during the playing of the game, or purchased through real-world credit cards, enabled the player to buy mules, horses, paint buckets, hand drills, nails, <b>bricks,</b> <b>hammers</b> and other assorted crops or items. These items were essential for completing certain goals. Friends could also send these items as gifts to the player.|$|R
50|$|Throughout its existence, the Adirondack Iron Works {{operated}} two farms, {{the blast}} furnace and forge, a puddling furnace, charcoal and <b>brick</b> kilns, trip <b>hammers</b> and a grist and saw mill. The Village consisted of sixteen dwellings and a {{building with a}} cupola, used as school, church and the general assembly room.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} to deterring smash and grab raiders. Shopkeepers can securely tether their goods, {{and make the}} tethering obvious to the onlooker. They can also avoid displaying goods of value in windows, an approach that has the disadvantage of reducing the attractiveness of the display to customers. Additionally, shopkeepers can strengthen window glass, {{to the extent that}} it can withstand, without breaking, being hit by the implements that smash and grab raiders are likely to use, such as <b>hammers,</b> <b>bricks,</b> and scaffolding poles.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>brick</b> crusher <b>hammers</b> {{were used}} in factory, which wear-resisting was poorer. According this phenomenon, the single {{structure}} was designed in symmetrical fission structure. Firstly, high chromium cast and low alloy steel were casted into half of the bimetal hammer head, then two new type bimetal hammer head were connected into a whole body by the welding technology. The high abrasion resistance and impact toughness of bimetal composite material {{played an important role}} in process of use and the service life was improved effectively, which provided a new way of thinking for complex compound casting. The results showed that the new type of bimetal composite casting and welding connection hammer production’s cost was 1. 5 times of high manganese steel hammer, but the service life was improved 3 ~ 5 times. Low alloy steel and high chromium cast iron composite layer was a metallurgical combination, and the whole strength was good and no fault phenomenon in the using process after welding...|$|R
60|$|Vexed by a {{sense of}} his own pitifulness, this man of the world {{continued}} his pilgrimage down Broadway, which even in that desert state was full of a certain interest. Troops of laborers straggled along the pavements, each with his dinner-pail in hand; and in many places the eternal building up and pulling down was already going on; carts were struggling up the slopes of vast cellars, with loads of distracting rubbish; here stood the half-demolished walls of a house, with a sad variety of wall-paper showing in the different rooms; there clinked the trowel upon the <b>brick,</b> yonder the <b>hammer</b> on the stone; overhead swung and threatened the marble block that the derrick was lifting to its place. As yet these forces of demolition and construction had the business of the street almost to themselves.|$|R
40|$|Neurotrauma – {{prevention}} and public health: Poster Session 3 : abstract no. 0430 Background: Head-neck-face injury {{has been recognized}} as one of the commonest injuries identified in intimate partner violence related injuries at hospital emergency departments. However, few studies have been investigated the reasons of attack, social factors of abusers and victims and women’s help-seeking behaviours. Objectives: The study aims to examine the patterns of head-neck-face injuries, reasons for attack, abusive and social histories by reviewing 5 -year hospital data. Methods: By using a retrospective cohort study, medical charts of abused women (n= 854) presented to the hospital emergency departments in Hong Kong from 2010 to 2014 were reviewed by research nurses. The medical records were identified from two computerized systems and individual medical charts were then retrieved from Medical Record Offices and reviewed manually. Results: There were 627 (73. 4 %) women admitted to emergency departments due to head-neck-face injuries, which were the most common injuries among them. Some of them (15 %) complained loss of conscious, dizziness, nausea, vomiting after injuries. The mean age was around 38. 6. Majority of them were married (82. 3 %) and some of them were cohabited (13. 6 %). Half of the women had reported multiple episodes of physical violence attack and 16 % of women disclosed psychological abuse, sexual abuse and economic abuse histories with the intimate partners. The reasons of the attack episode including couple relationship problems, extra-marital affairs, sexual problems, in-law conflicts, parenting issues, financial problems, alcoholism, drug addition, gambling and some trivial matters. Different weapons have been used for the violence attack and some of them might cause serious injuries, such as knife, chopper, <b>hammer,</b> <b>brick,</b> metal rod, gas bottle, and cooking pot. There were 10 % of women needed hospitalization but half of them discharged against medical advice. Conclusions: The study findings inform clinicians about the linkage between head-neck-face injuries and risks in abused women. The invisible head-neck-face injury related cognitive and behavioural problems, which might lead to re-victimization would also be discussed...|$|R
