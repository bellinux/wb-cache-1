40|$|One of {{the long-standing}} {{challenges}} in photography is motion <b>blur.</b> <b>Blur</b> artifacts are generated from relative motion between {{a camera and}} a scene during exposure. While <b>blur</b> can be reduced by using a shorter exposure, this comes at an unavoidable trade-off with increased noise. Therefore, it is desirable to remove <b>blur</b> computationally. To remove <b>blur,</b> we need to (i) estimate how the image is <b>blurred</b> (i. e. the <b>blur</b> kernel or the point-spread function) and (ii) restore a natural looking image through deconvolution. <b>Blur</b> kernel estimation is challenging because the algorithm needs to distinguish the correct image– <b>blur</b> pair from incorrect ones that can also adequately explain the <b>blurred</b> image. Deconvolution is also difficult because the algorithm needs to restore high frequency image contents attenuated by <b>blur.</b> In this dissertation, we address a few aspects of these challenges. We introduce an insight that a <b>blur</b> kernel can be estimated by analyzing edges in a <b>blurred</b> photograph. Edge profiles in a <b>blurred</b> image encode projections of the <b>blur</b> kernel, from which we can recover the <b>blur</b> using the inverse Radon transform.

40|$|<b>Blur</b> {{has been}} studied with {{isolated}} contours, but natural scenes are composed of occlusions at a range of depths giving rise to retinal images with broad distributions of <b>blur.</b> We have reported that observers are efficient at integrating wide distributions of <b>blur</b> with limited bias toward sharp or highly <b>blurred</b> elements in naturalistic, but highly controllable dead leaves patterns (Taylor & Bex, 2011 Journal of Vision 11 (15) 13). To extend these findings to natural scenes, we asked observers to match the local perceived <b>blur</b> in a natural image to the perceived <b>blur</b> in a dead leaves stimulus.

We developed a measure of local <b>blur</b> to relate perceived <b>blur</b> in natural images to the Gaussian <b>blur</b> in dead leaves stimuli. We found that our measure in regions traced by observers correlated well with the image <b>blur</b> in the dead leaves patch, indicating that the measure of perceived <b>blur</b> captures how <b>blur</b> is perceived in natural scenes. Further analyses revealed that the skew and kurtosis of <b>blur</b> distributions in traced regions was {{not significantly different from}} a Gaussian distribution, indicating that observers do not rely on overly sharp/blurred regions to judge perceived <b>blur.</b> Thus, the distribution of local image <b>blur,</b> rather than the global image <b>blur</b> or the <b>blur</b> of single items, determines perceived optical and image quality...|$|R

Digital {{photos are}} massively {{produced}} while digital cameras are becoming popular, however, not every photo has good quality. <b>Blur</b> {{is one of}} the conventional image quality degradation which is caused by various factors. In this paper, we propose a scheme to detect <b>blurred</b> images and classify them into several different categories. The <b>blur</b> detector uses support vector machines to estimate the <b>blur</b> extent of an image. The <b>blurred</b> images are further classified into either locally or globally <b>blurred</b> images. For globally <b>blurred</b> images, we estimate their point spread functions and classify them into camera shake or out of focus images. For locally <b>blurred</b> images, we find the <b>blurred</b> regions using a segmentation method, and the point spread function estimation on the <b>blurred</b> region can sort out the images with depth of field or moving object. The <b>blur</b> detection and classification processes are fully automatic and can help users to filter out <b>blurred</b> images before importing the photos into their digital photo albums. ...|$|R

The magnitude of image <b>blur</b> varies across space and time under natural viewing conditions owing to changes in pupil size and accommodation. <b>Blur</b> is frequently studied in the laboratory {{with a variety of}} digital filters, without comparing how the choice of filter affects <b>blur</b> perception. We examine the perception of image <b>blur</b> in synthetic images composed of contours whose orientation and curvature spatial properties matched those of natural images but whose <b>blur</b> could be directly controlled. The images were <b>blurred</b> by manipulating the slope of the amplitude spectrum, Gaussian low-pass filtering or filtering with a Sinc function, which, unlike slope or Gaussian filtering, introduces periodic phase reversals similar to those in optically <b>blurred</b> images. For slope-filtered images, <b>blur</b> discrimination thresholds for over-sharpened images were extremely high and perceived <b>blur</b> could not be matched with either Gaussian or Sinc filtered images, suggesting that directly manipulating image slope does not simulate the perception of <b>blur.</b> For Gaussian and Sinc <b>blurred</b> images, <b>blur</b> discrimination thresholds were dipper-shaped and were well-fit with a simple variance discrimination model and with a contrast detection threshold model, but the latter required different contrast sensitivity functions for different types of <b>blur.</b> <b>Blur</b> matches between Gaussian and Sinc <b>blurred</b> images were used to test several models of <b>blur</b> perception and were in good agreement with models based on luminance slope, but not with spatial frequency based models.
