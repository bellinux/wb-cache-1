40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 I know I could have her {{any time that}} I want and I know that she wants me even more. Don 2 ̆ 7 t mistake my {{certainty}} for over-confidence or a cocky sort of attitude 2 ̆ 7 cause I ain 2 ̆ 7 t about all that. Fact is, I can tell {{just by looking at}} a girl 2 ̆ 7 s eyes whether she want to bed me or not. Anyway, as if I needed to explain myself to you in the first place. You should be so lucky that I tell you anything at all. I mean, this is my life that you 2 ̆ 7 re reading about isn 2 ̆ 7 t it? I never really could figure out why people sit down with their pen and paper thinking that their words mean something. 2 ̆ 7 Cause as soon as idiot knuckle heads like you get a hold of the stuff it 2 ̆ 7 s as worthless as Christianity in Ethiopia everyone anticipates this great exchange, when all it ever amounts to is all take and no give. But like I was saying, this girl needs me real bad, right? And she 2 ̆ 7 s been sending the eye through this here crowded room all night long. You know, one of those sorry-ass stuffy inner-city houses that have 2 ̆ 2 College-Dormers-Living-Off-Campus-For-The-Semester 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 written all over them. And, as if the requisite dart board and too-cheesy-for-me portable bar with neon lights isn 2 ̆ 7 t bad enough they 2 ̆ 7 ve seen to it to invite every beer-suckin, titty-twistin, exam-flunking dork on campus. And so I 2 ̆ 7 m wondering (don 2 ̆ 7 t bother me, okay) : Self, would you bother moving off campus and endure extra commutes just so that you could not-quite-afford to drag everyone else off of campus to come to your house? But my self can 2 ̆ 7 t answer that question right now because the girl with the moist panties is staring me in the eye again. Well, like I said, she wants my sex something fierce. I almost never have to ask for it. Actually, I don 2 ̆ 7 t ever have to. Only sometimes I do it to humor the other person. Can you believe it? She 2 ̆ 7 s actually coming over here to me right now. I hate to say it, but I told you [...] . wait a minute, I don 2 ̆ 7 t have to say it because you 2 ̆ 7 ve probably read it somewhere before. Anyway I got to go right now to take care of business if you know what I mean, but I 2 ̆ 7 ll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>right</b> away. 2 ̆...|$|E
