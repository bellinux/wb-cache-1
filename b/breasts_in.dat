5|$|Inverse {{psoriasis}} (also {{known as}} flexural psoriasis) appears as smooth, inflamed patches of skin. The patches frequently affect skin folds, particularly around the genitals (between the thigh and groin), the armpits, {{in the skin}} folds of an overweight abdomen (known as panniculus), between the buttocks in the intergluteal cleft, and under the <b>breasts</b> <b>in</b> the inframammary fold. Heat, trauma, and infection are thought {{to play a role}} in the development of this atypical form of psoriasis.|$|E

5|$|Becky starts dating local builder Jason Grimshaw, {{but after}} being {{with him for}} several months, she cheats on him with pub {{landlord}} Steve McDonald. Jason and Becky move in together, but when Jason's ex-wife Sarah Grimshaw (Tina O'Brien) reveals she is considering coming home, he ends things with Becky. Becky attacks Jason in The Rovers Return pub and then goes on a pub crawl, getting drunk and stealing a girl's purse in a nightclub, flashing her <b>breasts</b> <b>in</b> public, and vandalising a travel agency window and a police car. When the police bring Becky in for questioning over her actions, she encounters DC Hooch (Dominic Carter), an adversary from her past.

40|$|Background: To {{determine}} {{in a large}} {{series of}} surgical biopsies, the frequency of various histologic types of primary solid malignant neoplasms in males and females in different age groups. Methods: A retrospective study of 20, 000 consecutive surgical biopsies reposted in the section of histopathology, AKU in 2004. Results: Malignant neoplasms are commonest in the fifth and sixth decades of life. The commonest malignant neoplasms {{in the first decade}} were Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Wilm’s tumor in males and females respectively. In the second decade, osteosarcoma in males and Ewing’s sarcoma / PNET in females. In the third decade, colorectal adenocarcinoma in males and infiltrating Ductal carcinoma of <b>breast</b> <b>in</b> females. In the fourth decade, squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity in males and infiltrating ductal carcinoma of <b>breast</b> <b>in</b> females. In the fifth decade squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity in males and infiltrating ductal carcinoma of <b>breast</b> <b>in</b> females. In sixth decade, squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity in males and infiltrating ductal carcinoma of <b>breast</b> <b>in</b> females and in the seventh decade, prostatic adenocarcinoma in males and infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the <b>breast</b> <b>in</b> females. Above age of 70 years, the commonest malignant were again prostatic adenocarcinoma in males and infiltrating ductal carcinoma of <b>breast</b> <b>in</b> females. Conclusion: Malignant neoplasms are commonest in the fourth, fifth and sixth decades of life. Keywords...|$|R

25|$|Western society {{tends to}} {{perceive}} <b>breasts</b> <b>in</b> sexual terms instead of for their biological purpose.

25|$|By {{the time}} of the Renaissance, décolletage became very fashionable. There was some status to firm <b>breasts</b> <b>in</b> upper class women, who did not breast feed. Infants were given to wet nurses to breast feed, since nursing was {{considered}} bad if a woman wanted to maintain an ideal form. Among the wealthier classes, the corset was beginning to appear by the mid-15th century.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with their}} major {{function}} in providing nutrition for infants, female breasts have social and sexual characteristics.

25|$|For women's dress, {{the day to}} day outfit of {{the skirt}} and jacket style were {{practical}} and tactful, recalling the working class woman. Women's fashions followed classical ideals, and tightly laced corsets were temporarily abandoned {{in favor of a}} high-waisted, natural figure. This natural figure was emphasized by being able to see the body beneath the clothing. Visible breasts were part of this classical look, and some characterized the <b>breasts</b> <b>in</b> fashion as solely aesthetic and sexual.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} nineteenth century, breast {{implants}} {{have been used to}} surgically augment the size (volume), modify the shape (contour), and enhance the feel (tact) of a woman’s <b>breasts.</b> <b>In</b> 1895, surgeon Vincenz Czerny effected the earliest breast implant emplacement when he used the patient's autologous adipose tissue, harvested from a benign lumbar lipoma, to repair the asymmetry of the breast from which he had removed a tumor. In 1889, surgeon Robert Gersuny experimented with paraffin injections, with disastrous results.|$|E

25|$|In many European {{societies}} {{between the}} Renaissance and the 19th century, wearing low-cut dresses that exposed breasts was more acceptable than today; with a woman's bared legs, ankles, or shoulders being {{considered to be}} more risqué than exposed <b>breasts.</b> <b>In</b> aristocratic and upper-class circles the display of breasts was at times regarded as a status symbol, {{as a sign of}} beauty, wealth or social position.

25|$|In the 14th century, necklines were lowered, {{clothes were}} {{tightened}} and breasts {{were once again}} flaunted. It was during the Renaissance period that the corset was born.

In 1450, Agnès Sorel, mistress to Charles VII of France, is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with fully bared <b>breasts</b> <b>in</b> the French court.

However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, sex reassignment surgery is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Angiolipoma is {{an unusual}} variant of lipoma {{involving}} subcutaneous tissues on trunk and extremities. This tumor is rarely described <b>in</b> the <b>breast</b> and particularly <b>in</b> <b>breast</b> male. Case report: We report here the case of angiolipoma of the <b>breast</b> <b>in</b> a 55 -year-old man complained of tenderness <b>in</b> the left <b>breast.</b> Ultrasonography showed a homogenously, well circumscribed, hyperechoic mass in the internal quadran of breast. The surgically resected tumor showed mature fat cells separated by proliferating branched vessels and intravascular hyaline thrombi. Conclusion: The existence of angiolipoma of the <b>breast</b> <b>in</b> the male must not to be forgotten because this tumor may be confused clinically, radiologically and pathologically with a malignant tumor. © SAGE Publications 2011.
