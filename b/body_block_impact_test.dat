3000|$|The {{fracture}} energy of adhesive joints can be experimentally measured using the double cantilever beam (DCB) test method for mode I fracture [2]. However, {{this test is}} only standardized under the quasi-static condition. Conversely, {{the strength of the}} joint at high loading rates is an important issue for the safety of vehicles. <b>Block</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> [3] were conducted for the fracture strength in shear, whereas <b>impact</b> wedge-peel <b>tests</b> [4] and DCB tests with a hydraulic tensile test machine [5] were conducted for the mode I {{fracture energy}} {{in a wide range of}} loading speed. These methods have difficulty in measuring the load because the dynamic effects are significant. Additionally, an asymmetric fracture is observed when one side of the DCB specimen is pulled at a high speed [5]. To measure the mode I fracture energy under the impact loading condition in another manner, a falling-wedge <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> machine using a DCB specimen was proposed by Xu et al. [6]. An opening displacement and a crack length are measured with a high-speed camera. With a load-independent analysis, the fracture energy can be calculated without measuring the load.

40|$|Experiments in {{controlled}} {{conditions were}} necessary to analyze the characteristics and potentialities of the different EM sensing techniques for the infrastructure monitoring in the ISTIMES project. The Ifsttar experimental station on the Montagnole site was so used by submitting a piece civil engineering infrastructure to <b>block</b> <b>impacts</b> (Figure 1). A simplified structure was chosen to facilitate measurements and analysis. A reinforced beam of 16 m long has been installed parallel to the cliff of the test site. It leans on two pillars screwed on two foundation structures (Figure 2). Foundation structures consist of armed concrete element anchored in the ground floor by 8 threaded rods. <b>Block</b> <b>impact</b> trials were performed by dropping blocks from the dropping device located {{at the top of}} a 60 m high cliff in the test site (Figure 1). Two types of block-fall tests were planned to follow the progressive damage of the beam: The first planned falling action consists in indirect <b>block</b> <b>impacts</b> on the <b>test</b> site ground floor close to the beam. The second planned falling action consists in direct <b>block</b> <b>impacts</b> onto the beam. Steel round blocks of 2. 5 Tons (Figure 2) and 10 Tons were used. In the second configuration only the 2. 5 Tons steel block was used due to the high risk of breaking rapidly the beam. In the first configuration, in order to study and compare structural damage induced by indirect impacts we need to evaluate effective effects onto the structure. This study focuses so on determination of strains generated by indirect impacts on beam foundations. That is why geophone measurement surveys in the test site ground floor were organized in the same time of the different planned falling actions and at different times without the beam. A first geological model of the test site was established by studying existing data about the Montagnole area and observing outcrops in the quarry. The monitored geophone signals allowed confirming and completing this model as well as evaluating parameters for a numerical model for wave's propagation in the ground floor. For this the CESAR software (LCPC, 2005) was used...|$|R

For example, {{from the second}} <b>body</b> <b>block</b> in Fig.  1, two component queries are generated: “It {{was the best of}} Twitter It” and “was the worst of Twitter” given σ _qmax = 14 and σ _qmin = 4.

40|$|Due to {{the large}} volume {{consumption}} of polyolefins, {{the treatment of the}} resulting solid waste is becoming a major concern. One possible utilization of the polyolefin wastes is to form blends from recycled polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). This study is a preliminary investigation on the impact fracture behaviour for the PP/PE blends. The <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> method employed in this study includes the conventional and instrumented Izod <b>impact</b> <b>tests,</b> the instrumented Charpy <b>impact</b> <b>test,</b> and the instrumented drop weight plate <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> (IDWPIT). In both conventional and instrumented Izod <b>impact</b> <b>testing,</b> PP homopolymer and PP/LDPE blend have similar impact strengths, while PP/HDPE blend exhibits slightly lower impact strength. However, the instrumented Charpy <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> indicates that both PP/LDPE and PP/HDPE have similar impact strengths, and both are slightly lower than PP homopolymer. This suggests that the type of <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> employed is playing {{an important role in the}} impact fracture behaviour of the PP/PE blends. The effect of temperature on the impact fracture behaviour for the PP/PE blends was evaluated by means of the Charpy and drop weight plate <b>impact</b> <b>tests.</b> During the <b>tests,</b> <b>impact</b> strengths reduced with decreasing testing temperature.

30|$|Overall, the CRF {{method is}} much better than {{heuristic}} rules in labeling blocks. Table  2 shows that the Heuristic method performs badly on title prediction in terms of precision (only 0.34). It is partially because about a half of screenshots do not contain a title, but the Heuristic method selects one anyway. Such a decision somehow hurts the recall of <b>body</b> <b>blocks.</b> Thus {{it is not surprising that}} the Heuristic method performs worse than the CRF method in terms of recall for <b>body</b> <b>blocks.</b> The Heuristic method is also worse than the CRF method by 21 points in terms of precision for bodies. This is strong evidence that the Heuristic method is not effective in distinguishing a <b>body</b> <b>block</b> from other blocks, whereas, the CRF method achieves precision as high as 0.967.
