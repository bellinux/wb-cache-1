5000|$|The {{unimproved}} {{state of}} {{the mouth of the}} bay was a crescent-shaped bar covered by a line of breaking waves. [...] The entrance of the bay is protected by two sand spits, named South Spit and North Spit. The <b>bay</b> <b>mouth</b> was stabilized by jetties with one jetty projecting from each spit. [...] The South Spit jetty was built starting in 1889, but by 1890 it was apparent that it was eroding the North Spit and widening the channel. [...] The jetties are approximately 6,000 ft long and 2,200 ft apart. Storm damage led to rebuilding of the jetties in 1911, 1927, 1932, 1939, 1950, 1957, 1963, 1971, 1988 and 1995. Entrance currents are strong ranging from 2.0 knots average maximum ebb and 1.6 knots average maximum flood; although peak rates can be nearly twice as high.|$|E

Bottlenose dolphin density was estimated using line transect methods and a 4 -term Hermite polynomial was chosen to model the detection function. Six surveys in the Chesapeake <b>Bay</b> <b>mouth</b> resulted in an average density estimate of 0. 159 dolphinslkm 2 • Ten surveys along the southern Virginia coast produced an average density estimate of 3. 446 bottlenose dolphinslkm 2 within 2 km of shore. Average bottlenose dolphin abundance in the Chesapeake <b>Bay</b> <b>mouth</b> and along the southern Virginia coast was esl;imated at 340 dolphins (± 104, 95 % C. I.). An estimate of 0. 208 bottlenose dolphinslkm 2 along the northern Virginia coast is tenuous because only one survey was conducted there. Dolphin sightings were distributed uniformly along the southern Virginia coast {{with the exception of}} some clustering of herd sightings at the capes bordering the Chesapeake <b>Bay</b> <b>mouth.</b> The percentage of calves per herd aver-aged 7. 5 % in Chesapeake <b>Bay</b> <b>mouth.</b> 4. 3 % in the southern coastal area. 9. 0 % in the northern coastal area, and peaked in June.

40|$|Abstract. The water {{exchange}} with outer sea for the nearly closed bay is very weak, {{leading to the}} serious deterioration of {{the environment of the}} bay. Numerical experiments have been performed to find the effects of change of the water depth at the <b>bay</b> <b>mouth</b> on the water exchanging ability of the nearly closed bay. The results indicated, by decreasing the depth at the nearly closed <b>bay</b> <b>mouth</b> appropriately, the water exchanging ability can be improved...|$|E
40|$|The {{amounts of}} silt and clay {{in the coastal}} sands and the marine sediments of Nagura Bay were small as {{compared}} with Kabira Bay, which has a narrower <b>bay</b> <b>mouth.</b> Main primary minerals of the coastal sands and the marine sediments were quartz and feldspar in both Nagura {{and the head of}} Kabira Bay. Small amounts of aragonite were in the marine sediments of Nagura Bay. Whereas, considerable amounts of calcite and aragonite were in the coastal sands and the marine sediments in the <b>bay</b> <b>mouth</b> and the bay center of Kabira Bay. The above-mentioned differences were assumed to be due to the difference {{in the shape of the}} bays, particularly to the <b>bay</b> <b>mouth</b> features. The influence of eroded and transported backland soils to the coast and the marine bed was relatively small in Nagura Bay compared to the bay head of Kabira Bay...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} provide {{background}} information and scientific basis for pollution control of Pb, this paper analyzed the sink and transfer process of Pb in Jiaozhou Bay. Results showed that Pb in Jiaozhou Bay was mainly sourced from agricultural non-point source and urban point source, as well as atmosphere dry and wet deposition, leading to the contents of Pb were increasing from spring to summer, and decreasing in autumn and winter. Due to Jiaozhou Bay is a closed bay, the narrow <b>bay</b> <b>mouth</b> {{is vital to the}} water exchange, which is the force of horizontal distributions. Horizontal diffusion and vertical deposition were the two major transferred processes of Pb, leading to a large amount of Pb was finally transferred to the sea bottom of the <b>bay</b> <b>mouth</b> areas, and the sea bottom of <b>bay</b> <b>mouth</b> areas was the sink of Pb in Jiaozhou Bay...|$|E

30|$|The {{observed}} {{velocity field}} at the surface (− 10  m depth) on July 5 (Figure  11 e) shows a clockwise circulation {{that is similar to}} the simulation, although current speeds for the circulation were generally five times greater than simulated speeds. The underestimation of the surface velocity field {{can be attributed to the}} model's vertical resolution; the layer thickness around the surface layer, from 0 to 20  m, is coarse (4  m), which may insufficiently resolve the surface boundary layer. Local inconsistencies between the simulation and observations were found to correspond to detailed flow patterns around the <b>bay</b> <b>mouth</b> and along the northern coast in the outer bay. The inconsistency around the <b>bay</b> <b>mouth</b> can be attributed to tidal components, for example, the 10  cm s− 1 velocity observed at the <b>bay</b> <b>mouth</b> (Ohtani [1981]) can be attributed to the M 2 tidal component. The local wind pattern can induce the observed inconsistency in the outer bay, because the horizontal resolution of the wind (GPV/MSM) was originally 5  km, insufficient to resolve the 10  km spatial pattern of the wind. The observed speed at a depth of − 50  m (Figure  11 f) was comparable to the simulated speeds (not shown), which also suggests that the simulation underestimated the surface velocity field.|$|E
