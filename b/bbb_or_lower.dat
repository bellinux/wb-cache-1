40|$|BackgroundTranscatheter {{aortic valve}} {{implantation}} (TAVI) {{has become the}} standard therapy for high-risk and non-operable patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, the procedure involves several adverse effects, such as rhythm and conduction disturbances. Patients with postprocedural left bundle branch block may have an increased mortality risk, whereas patients with preprocedural right bundle branch block display {{a higher rate of}} postinterventional bradyarrhythmias. ObjectiveThe {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the occurrence of high-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) in patients with preexisting bundle branch block (<b>BBB)</b> <b>or</b> <b>BBB</b> occurring during TAVI. MethodsIn this prospective single-center study, 50 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI with the Medtronic CoreValve Revalving System were included. Of these patients, 17 with preexisting <b>BBB</b> <b>or</b> <b>BBB</b> occurring during TAVI received a primary prophylactic permanent DDD pacemaker, programmed to the SafeR-mode and featuring dual-channel event counters as well as stored intracardiac electrograms. Pacemaker readouts and intracardiac electrograms were analyzed for the occurrence of high-degree AVB. ResultsTen of 17 patients (58. 8 %) with preexisting <b>BBB</b> <b>or</b> <b>BBB</b> occurring during TAVI developed episodes of high-degree AVB that were immediately terminated due to switch into DDD backup pacing. In 5 of the cases (29. 4 %), the first documented episode of high-degree AVB occurred after hospital discharge. Mean follow-up period was 578. 1 ± 294. 9 days. ConclusionDevelopment of high-degree AVB is a common complication in patients with preexisting <b>BBB</b> <b>or</b> <b>BBB</b> occurring during TAVI. Accordingly, intensified monitoring might be reasonable, especially in patients treated with the self-expandable Medtronic CoreValve Revalving System...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The goal of {{this study}} was to examine the {{association}} between ECG repolarization parameters and mortality in Chagas disease (CD) patients living in the United States. Methods: CD patients with cardiomyopathy (CM) and bundle branch block (<b>BBB)</b> <b>or</b> <b>BBB</b> alone were compared to age- and sex-matched controls. QT interval, QT dispersion (QTd), T wave peak to T wave end duration (Tp-Te) and T wave peak to T wave end dispersion ((Tp- Te) d) were measured. Presence of fractionated QRS (fQRS) was also assessed. The main outcome measure was the association between ECG parameters and mortality or need for cardiac transplant. Results: A total of 18 CM and 13 BBB CD patients were studied with 97 % originating from Mexico or Central America. QTd (60. 0 ± 15. 0 ms vs 43. 5 ± 9. 8 ms, P= 0. 0002), Tp-Te (102. 6 ± 29. 3 ms vs 77. 1 ± 11. 0 ms, P= 0. 0002) and (Tp-Te) d (39. 5 ± 9. 4 ms vs 22. 7 ± 7. 6 ms, P< 0. 0001) were prolonged in CD CM patients compared to CM controls. Chagas CM patients had more fQRS then controls (84. 2 ± 0. 10 % vs 33. 3 ± 0. 11 %, p= 0. 0005).

30|$|The {{increased}} perifocal glutamate {{positively correlated}} with enhanced BBB permeability and increased BWC.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{vascular}} system {{is adapted to}} specific functions in different tissues and organs. Vascular endothelial cells are important elements of this adaptation, leading {{to the concept of}} 'specialized endothelial cells'. The phenotype of these cells is highly dependent on their specific microenvironment and when isolated and cultured, they lose their specific features after few passages, making models using such cells poorly predictive and irreproducible. We propose a new source of specialized endothelial cells based on cord blood circulating endothelial progenitors (EPCs). As prototype examples, we evaluated the capacity of EPCs to acquire properties characteristic of cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (blood-brain barrier (<b>BBB))</b> <b>or</b> of arterial endothelial cells, in specific inducing culture conditions. APPROACH AND RESULTS: First, we demonstrated that EPC-derived endothelial cells (EPDCs) co-cultured with astrocytes acquired several BBB phenotypic characteristics, such as restricted paracellular diffusion of hydrophilic solutes and the expression of tight junction proteins. Second, we observed that culture of the same EPDCs in a high concentration of VEGF resulted, through activation of Notch signaling, in an increase of expression of most arterial endothelial markers. CONCLUSIONS: We have thus demonstrated that in vitro culture of early passage human cord blood EPDCs under specific conditions can induce phenotypic changes towards <b>BBB</b> <b>or</b> arterial phenotypes, indicating that these EPDCs maintain enough plasticity to acquire characteristics of a variety of specialized phenotypes. We propose that this property of EPDCs might be exploited for producing specialized endothelial cells in culture to be used for drug testing and predictive in vitro assays...|$|R

50|$|Although leptin reduces {{appetite}} as a circulating signal, obese individuals generally {{exhibit a}} higher circulating concentration of leptin than normal weight individuals {{due to their}} higher percentage body fat. These people show resistance to leptin, similar to resistance of insulin in type 2 diabetes, with the elevated levels failing to control hunger and modulate their weight. A number of explanations have been proposed to explain this. An important contributor to leptin resistance is changes to leptin receptor signalling, particularly in the arcuate nucleus, however, deficiency of, or major changes to, the leptin receptor itself are not {{thought to be a}} major cause. Other explanations suggested include changes to the way leptin crosses the blood brain barrier (<b>BBB)</b> <b>or</b> alterations occurring during development.|$|R

For one, {{the nature of the}} infectious agent, the prion, is understood only in outline, and its composition, structure, and mode of replication are still shrouded in mystery. In addition, the mechanism of pathogenesis is not well understood. Because clinical disease affects mainly the brain parenchyme, therapeutic agents must be able to traverse the brain-blood barrier (<b>BBB)</b> <b>or</b> have to be introduced directly into the cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissue. And finally, because the disease is usually recognized only after onset of severe clinical symptoms, the question arises as to whether the neurodegenerative processes can be reversed to any extent after a successful eradication of the agent...|$|R
