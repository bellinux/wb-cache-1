5000|$|Kraus {{came through}} the youth ranks of FC Schalke 04, making his Oberliga debut as a 19-year-old on 10 April 1963 in a match against TSV Marl-Hüls. Having made one {{appearance}} for Schalke, Kraus moved to the Netherlands the following season and played for the Deventer-based team Go Ahead Eagles. He came back to Germany in 1964, signing for Regionalliga team Tennis Borussia Berlin and moved back to Schalke in 1966. Over two seasons in the Bundesliga, Kraus scored 16 goals in 36 top flight appearances, helping the team against their relegation struggles. The striker, who did not shy away from tackling his footballing opponents, was known for not pulling his punches. He was as unpredictable in the penalty area {{as he was in}} his private life. Kraus missed the first two months of the 1967-68 Bundesliga season after breaking his arm in two places following a car crash in the Netherlands. Soon afterwards, he brutally attacked the barman at a local café; the club fining him 250 Deutsche Mark for [...] "unsportsmanlike moral conduct". Kraus promised to right his wrongs, and on his comeback to the side, scored nine goals in 12 games. The club, however, fired the player in February 1968 after the police had stopped his car and found goods stolen from a burglary, including <b>break-in</b> <b>tools,</b> a loaded gun and bottles of propane gas used for welding open vaults.|$|E
