5|$|In 1983, Evgeny Nikolaev's book Predavshie Gippokrata (Betrayers of Hippocrates), when {{translated}} from Russian into German {{under the title}} Gehirnwäsche in Moskau (Brainwashing in Moscow), first came out in München and told about psychiatric detention of its author for political reasons. In 1984, the book under its original title {{was first published in}} Russian which the book had originally <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E

5|$|Mongolian has <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> {{a variety}} of alphabets, making it a {{language}} {{with one of the}} largest number of scripts used historically. The earliest stages of Mongolian (Xianbei, Wuhuan languages) may have used an indigenous runic script as indicated by Chinese sources. The Khitan large script adopted in 920 CE is an early Mongol (or according to some, para-Mongolic) script.|$|E
5|$|Codex Zacynthius (designated by siglum Ξ or 040 in the Gregory-Aland numbering; A1 in von Soden) is a Greek New Testament codex, dated paleographically to the 6th century. First {{thought to}} have <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> the 8th century, it is a palimpsest—the {{original}} (lower) text was washed off its vellum pages and overwritten in the 12th or 13th century. The upper text of the palimpsest contains weekday Gospel lessons; the lower text contains portions of the Gospel of Luke, deciphered by biblical scholar and palaeographer Tregelles in 1861. The lower text is of most interest to scholars.|$|E
5|$|From {{the classic}} {{language}} {{to the present}} day, a body of literature has <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> Mayan languages. The earliest texts to have been preserved are largely monumental inscriptions documenting rulership, succession, and ascension, conquest and calendrical and astronomical events. It is likely that other kinds of literature were written in perishable media such as codices made of bark, only four of which have survived the ravages {{of time and the}} campaign of destruction by Spanish missionaries.|$|E

50|$|Some {{parts of}} the {{manuscript}} <b>were</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> different time by different scribes. The leaves 1-103 with text of Acts-Jude 24 <b>were</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> the 12th century; the leaves 104-191 with the text of Jude 24 - Colossians <b>were</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> the 13th century; the leaves 192-228 with the text 1 Thessalonians-Philemon <b>were</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> the 12th century; the leaves 229-254 with {{the text of the}} Apocalypse and scholia <b>were</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> the 14th century.|$|R
50|$|The text <b>is</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> Greek {{minuscule}} letters, in {{two columns}} per page, 13 lines per page (according to the reconstruction). The left column <b>is</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> Greek, the right column <b>is</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> Arabic.|$|R
5|$|Mustaine {{had said}} that {{thirteen}} songs had <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> the sessions for the album, though only twelve were originally contracted for the album (one of which being a bonus track intended only for the Japanese market). However, it was later revealed that the album was to feature a total of 13 tracks. Several of the songs on the album were previously recorded by the band {{in one form or}} another, although most of the songs are completely new material.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Aneirin {{manuscript}} is {{from the}} later 13th century, but Y Gododdin has been dated to anywhere between the 7th and the early 11th centuries. The text is partly written in Middle Welsh orthography and partly in Old Welsh. The early date would place its oral composition soon after the battle, presumably in the Hen Ogledd ("Old North"); as such it would have <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> the Cumbric dialect of Common Brittonic. Others consider it {{the work of a}} poet from Wales in the 9th, 10th or 11th century. Even a 9th-century date would make it one of the oldest surviving Welsh works of poetry.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest {{is thought}} by most {{scholars}} to have <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> 1610–11, and is generally accepted {{as the last}} play that Shakespeare wrote alone, although some have questioned either or both assertions. Scholars also note {{that it is impossible}} to determine if the play was written before, after, or at the same time as The Winter's Tale, the dating of which has been equally problematic. Edward Blount entered The Tempest into the Stationers' Register on 8 November 1623. It was one of 16 Shakespearean plays that Blount registered on that date.|$|E

5|$|The last review {{he wrote}} {{was for the}} film To the Wonder, which he gave 3.5 out of 4 stars in a review for the Chicago Sun-Times. It was {{published}} on April 6, 2013. In July 2013, a previously unpublished review of the film Computer Chess appeared on Ebert's website. The review had <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> March but had remained unpublished until the film's wide-release date. Matt Zoller Seitz, the editor for Ebert's website, confirmed {{that there were other}} unpublished reviews that would be eventually uploaded to the website. A second posthumously published review, for The Spectacular Now, was published in August 2013.|$|E
5|$|When {{adopting}} {{new concepts}} or technologies, Greenlandic usually constructs new words made from Greenlandic roots, but modern Greenlandic has also taken many loans from Danish and English. The language has <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> the Latin script since Danish colonization {{began in the}} 1700s. The first orthography was developed by Samuel Kleinschmidt in 1851, but within a hundred years already differed substantially from the spoken language because {{of a number of}} sound changes. An extensive orthographic reform undertaken in 1973 that made the script easier to learn resulted in a boost in Greenlandic literacy, which is now {{among the highest in the}} world.|$|E
5|$|While in Lagos, Achebe {{started work}} on a novel. This was challenging, since very little African fiction had <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> English, {{although}} Amos Tutuola's Palm-Wine Drinkard (1952) and Cyprian Ekwensi's People of the City (1954) were notable exceptions. While appreciating Ekwensi's work, Achebe worked hard to develop his own style, even as he pioneered {{the creation of the}} Nigerian novel itself. A visit to Nigeria by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956 brought issues of colonialism and politics to the surface, and was a significant moment for Achebe.|$|E

5|$|Although Amir {{had little}} {{correspondence}} {{with his friends}} in Java, his poems– most of which had <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> Java– continued {{to be published in}} Poedjangga Baroe. His first poetry collection, Nyanyi Sunyi (Songs of Silence), was published in the magazine's November 1937 edition. Nearly two years later, in June 1939, the magazine published a collection of poems Amir had translated, entitled Setanggi Timur (Incense from the East). In June 1941 his last collection, Buah Rindu (Fruits of Longing), was published. All were later republished as stand-alone books. A last book, Sastera Melayu Lama dan Raja-Rajanya (Old Malay Literature and its Kings), was published in Medan in 1942; this was based on a radio speech Amir had delivered.|$|E
5|$|Antoine Gardano {{became the}} primary Italian {{publisher}} for Arcadelt, although the competing Venetian publishing house of Scotto brought {{out one of}} his madrigal books as well. Arcadelt's Il bianco e dolce cigno opened one of Gardano's books; as the piece had already achieved immense fame, it was the main selling point. In Paris, some of Arcadelt's chansons appeared as early as 1540 in the publications of Pierre Attaingnant and Jacques Moderne, so must have <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> Italy. After Arcadelt returned to France, his chansons, masses, and motets appeared in the editions of the printing firm of Le Roy and Ballard throughout the 1550s and 1560s, while his music was still being printed in distant Venice.|$|E
5|$|Composite bows {{have been}} known from {{archaeology}} and art since the second millennium BCE, but their history is not well recorded as they were developed by cultures without a written tradition. They originated among Asiatic pastoralists who used them as daily necessities, classically for mounted archery although {{they can also be}} used on foot. Such bows spread among the military (and hunters) of civilizations that came into contact with nomad tribes; composite bows have been used across Asia from Korea to the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North Africa, and southwards in the Arabian peninsula and in India. The use of horn in a bow was even remarked on in Homer's epic, The Odyssey, believed to have <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> the 8th century BCE.|$|E

The first scribe has a somewhat unskilled hand; the second has a clear, elegant Parisian hand. The calendar text <b>was</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> red, gold, and blue ink, depending on the particular feast. The Gospels <b>were</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> alternating lines in blue, gold, and red inks. The text specific to the liturgical hours <b>was</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> Latin with black, and rarely blue, ink.

5|$|Khmer {{differs from}} {{neighboring}} languages such as Thai, Burmese, Lao and Vietnamese {{in that it}} is not a tonal language. Words are stressed on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon–Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a minor syllable. The language has <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> the Khmer script, an abugida descended from the Brahmi script via the southern Indian Pallava script, since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write clusters and a division of consonants into two series with different inherent vowels. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds {{believes}} The Sun Also Rises {{could only}} have <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> 1925: it perfectly captured the period between World WarI and the Great Depression, and immortalized a group of characters. In the years since its publication, the novel {{has been criticized for}} its anti-Semitism, as expressed in the characterization of Robert Cohn. Reynolds explains that although the publishers complained to Hemingway about his description of bulls, they allowed his use of Jewish epithets, which showed the degree to which anti-Semitism was accepted in the US after World WarI. Cohn represented the Jewish establishment and contemporary readers would have understood this from his description. Hemingway clearly makes Cohn unlikeable not only as a character but as a character who is Jewish. Critics of the 1970s and 1980s considered Hemingway to be misogynistic and homophobic; by the 1990s his work, including The Sun Also Rises, began to receive critical reconsideration by female scholars.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the ninth}} century, English has <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> a Latin {{alphabet}} (also called Roman alphabet). Earlier Old English texts in Anglo-Saxon runes are only short inscriptions. The {{great majority of}} literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet. The modern English alphabet contains 26 letters of the Latin script: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z (which also have capital forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).|$|E
