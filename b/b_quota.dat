40|$|Heme is the iron-containing {{prosthetic}} group of hemoproteins, {{and is thus}} required for photosynthesis, respiration and nitrate reduction in marine phytoplankton. Here we report concentrations of heme b in Southern Ocean phytoplankton and contrast our findings with those in coastal species. The concentration of particulate heme b (pmol l- 1) observed {{at the end of}} the exponential growth phase was related to the concentration of dissolved iron in the culture media. Small Southern Ocean phytoplankton species (< 6 µm in diameter) had heme <b>b</b> <b>quotas</b> < 1 µmol mol- 1 carbon, the lowest yet reported for marine phytoplankton. Heme b was also depleted in these species with respect to chlorophyll a. We calculated the amount of carbon accumulated per mole of heme b per second in our cultures (heme growth efficiency, HGE) and found that small Southern Ocean species can maintain growth rates, even while heme b content is reduced. Small Southern Ocean phytoplankton can thus produce more particulate carbon than larger Southern Ocean or small coastal species at equivalent iron concentrations. Combining primary productivity and heme b concentrations reported for the open ocean, we found that HGE in natural populations was within the range of our laboratory culture results. HGE was also observed to be higher at open ocean stations characterized by low iron concentrations. Our results suggest that low heme <b>b</b> <b>quotas</b> do not necessarily result in reduced growth and that marine phytoplankton can optimize iron use by manipulating the intracellular hemoprotein pool...|$|R

40|$|Possible {{means of}} rehabilitating the many {{depleted}} fisheries in European waters now form {{a topic of}} great interest and relevance. This paper uses bioeconomic analysis to predict returns for the Irish Sea Nephrops fishery from rationalisation through three types of management regulations. These regulation measures are (a) decommissioning, i. e., reducing fleet size, (<b>b)</b> catch <b>quotas,</b> while maintaining fleet size, and (c) mesh size regulation. The analysis clearly demonstrates the gains to be obtained from rationalising the Nephrops fishery. In addition, socio-economic implications of trying to preserve employment levels while rationalising are examined. This is done by attempting to anticipate the reactions of the industry to the different management processes. The paper concludes that the current performance of the fisheries compared to potential profitability is extremely poor. Substantially improved returns would result from strong management control. However, trying to preserve social equity, while theoretically possible, would necessitate complicated constraints to {{the operation of the}} management system...|$|R

40|$|Firms {{generate}} negative externalities, {{for example}} pollution, and thereby affect outcomes of welfare interest such as health. Which firms survive and thrive, {{and how those}} firms organize production, depends on regulatory incentives. Industrial regulations may therefore affect not only profits but also other outcomes of interest, through an industry’s response. The Peruvian fishing sector, the worlds largest, is regulated by (a) semi-annual fishing ban seasons and (<b>b)</b> fishing <b>quotas.</b> A 2009 reform replaced a market-wide quota with vessel-specific, transferable quotas (ITQs). The reform led to a reorganization of the sector, and to fishmeal production (and hence, air and water pollution) being spread out in time rather than concentrated early in the season, as boats incentive to rapidly capture {{a large share of}} the market-wide quota was eliminated. Matching daily fish and fishmeal production data to household surveys at the local level, we show that fishmeal production negatively affects child and adult health, increasing self-reported illness, medical expenditures, and decreasing hemoglobin levels. We show that these results are not driven by effects on the labor market. The increased fishing activity does not lead to changes in labor market participation or wages. We then show that the 2009 reform-widely heralded as a success- worsened the impact of the industry on health. More suggestively, we show that the reason appears to be that lower levels of air pollution spread out over longer periods is more harmful to health than high-intensity, short periods of exposure.

40|$|We ask which {{migration}} policy a developed country will choose when its {{objective is to}} attain the optimal skill composition of the country's workforce, and when the policy menu consists of an entry fee and a quota. We compare these two policies under the assumptions that individuals are heterogeneous in their skill level {{as well as in}} their skill type, and that individuals of one skill type, say "scientists," confer a positive externality on overall productivity whereas individuals of the other skill type, say "managers," do not confer such an externality. We find that a uniform entry fee encourages self-selection such that the migrants are only or mostly highly skilled managers. The (near) absence of migrant scientists has a negative effect on the productivity of the country's workforce. Under a quota: the migrants are (a) only averagely skilled managers if the productivity externality generated by the scientists is weak, or (b) only averagely skilled scientists if the productivity externality generated by the scientists is strong. In (a), a uniform entry fee is preferable to a <b>quota.</b> In (<b>b),</b> a <b>quota</b> is preferable to a uniform entry fee. If, however, the entry fee for scientists is sufficiently below the entry fee for managers, then migrants will be only or mostly highly skilled scientists, rendering a differentiated entry fee preferable to a quota even when the productivity externality is strong. Instituting a differentiated fee comes, though, at a cost: the fee revenue is not as high as it will be when migrants are only or mostly managers. We conclude that if maximizing the revenue from the entry fee is not the primary objective of the developed country, then a differentiated entry fee is the preferred policy...|$|R

Vitamin B 1 {{can only be}} produced by organisms that possess its complete synthesis pathway, while other organisms meet their cellular <b>B</b> 1 <b>quota</b> by scavenging the coenzyme from exogenous sources. Due to high bacterial cell density and diversity, marine sediments could represent {{some of the highest}} concentrations of putative B 1 producers, yet these environments have received little attention as a possible source of B 1 to the overlying water column. Here we report the first dissolved pore water profiles of B 1 measured in cores collected in two consecutive years from Santa Monica Basin, CA. Vitamin B 1 concentrations were fairly consistent between the two years ranging from 30 pM up to 770 pM. A consistent maximum at ~ 5 cm sediment depth covaried with dissolved concentrations of iron. Pore water concentrations were higher than water column levels and represented some of the highest known environmental concentrations of B 1 measured to date, (over two times higher than maximum water column concentrations) suggesting increased rates of cellular production and release within the sediments. A one dimensional diffusion-transport model applied to the B 1 profile was used to estimate a diffusive benthic flux of ~ 0. 7 nmol m 2 d- 1. This is an estimated flux across the sediment-water interface in a deep sea basin; if similar magnitude B-vitamin fluxes occur in shallow coastal waters, benthic input could prove to be a significant B 1 -source to the water column and may {{play an important role in}} supplying this organic growth factor to auxotrophic primary producers...|$|R
40|$|Cotton plays a {{strategic}} {{role in the}} development policies and poverty reduction programs of a number of African countries. Several African countries have introduced reforms in the cotton sector to improve its quality and competitiveness. The impact of these reforms has been virtually nullified because the WTO members continue to apply support measures and subsidies that distort global market prices. These are the arguments behind the African Cotton Initiative (ACI) proposed in 2003 and 2006 WTO Ministerial meetings. Specifically, the ACI proposed (a) phasing out the rich countries' cotton domestic supports; (<b>b)</b> duty and <b>quota</b> free access for African countries' cotton to developed countries' markets; and (c) removal of rich countries' cotton export subsidies. In contrast, the Doha Round Reductions agreed upon in 2005 WTO Ministerial meetings in Hong Kong are (a) all forms of export subsidies for cotton will be eliminated by developed countries; and (b) developed countries will give duty and quota free access for cotton exports from the least-developed countries (LDCs). This paper uses a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Zambian economy to study the impact of the Doha Round (DR) agreement and the ACI proposal on the cotton sector in Zambia and to contribute to the analysis of further agricultural trade liberalization and its implications for poor countries. The results show that Zambian cotton export price and exports rise, respectively, by 4. 23 % and 11. 12 % in the DR scenario and 15. 65 % and 43. 2 % in the ACI scenario. The labor employment in the cotton sector increases by 12. 52 % and 52. 06 % in the DR and ACI scenarios, respectively, which is highly beneficial as Zambia is enduring 50 % unemployment rate. Liberalization in the cotton world market also increases the GDP and rural household welfare. cotton initiative, Doha Round, general equilibrium analysis, Zambian cotton sector,...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this note is to {{mechanistically}} derive the logistic population growth models from the well tested and received Droop equation. 1. A mechanistic derivation of the logistic equation. Population growth involves and often {{is determined by the}} birth and death processes. Most of the existing studies focus on birth process on the combined birth and death processes (the growth process). In general, death mechanisms are more numerous and difficult to study then birth mechanisms in a lab or field setting. In a short time frame, growth dynamics can be approximated by a linear differential equation with the coefficient called growth rate. Longer term, this growth rate shall be regarded as time dependent, or density dependent. The so-called Droop equation provides a time and experiment tested simple mathematical expression for biomass growth rate. We shall show that it also provides a convenient base for deriving the classical logistic equation. This section is adapted from Kuang et al. (2004). In 1968, Droop reported some surprising findings based on his most ambitious and comprehensive chemostat experiment to date in terms of concept, technical difficulty and mathematical analysis, it was to surpass by far all that had gone before (Leadbeater, 2006). The experiment studied the kinetics of vitamin B 12 limitation in Monochrysis lutheri in continuous and exponentially growing batch cultures and in washed cell suspensions. The aim of this experiments was to relate specific growth rate to substrate concentration (Droop 1968). Contrary to conventional belief, the specific growth rate (m) of Monochrysis in the chemostats was found not to depend directly on medium substrate concentration. However, the one relationship that did stand out was that growth depended on the intracellular concentration of vitamin <b>B</b> 12 (cell <b>quota</b> Q). The relationship between specific growth rate (µ) and cell quota (Q) took the following simple form (Droop 1973, 1974). µ = µm 1 −...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The {{success of}} the U. S. {{government}} in persuading Japan to liberalize the beef market {{is viewed as a}} relief to the U. S. beef industry. The economic benefit (to the U. S. beef producers!) of the trade liberalization however is yet to be seen. The size of this benefit is determined, among others, by (a) the net change in Japan's retail price due to the liberalization, (b) the price elasticity of demand for the U. S. beef in Japan, (c) the degree of price rise in the world market, and (d) the export capacity of the domestic sector. Availability of alternative beef sources and the degree of substitutability between the U. S. beef and those alternatives affect factor (b) and factor (d) depends {{on the extent to which}} beef and other meat products substitute each other in the domestic market both in production and consumption. Evaluation of the U. S. - Japan Beef Market Access Agreement (BMAA) therefore has become a high policy profile. In the interest of assessing possible policy effects of BMAA, several researchers have attempted to parameterize and quantify the Japanese demand for beef. The fact that this market is (a) semi-isolated from the rest of the world by restrictive import <b>quota,</b> (<b>b)</b> managed domestically by government parastatal, and (c) characterized by multi- and intensely differentiated beef with no parallel historical data has made the choice of economic theory and methodology difficult. While most researchers (Group 1) relied on conventional method [e. g. 55; 125], others (Group 2) [2] contend that managed import market may better be explained by a model of political nature. By assuming the usual competitive market behavior, Group 1 underestimates possible implications of existing market structure for building and estimating conventional econometric models. Group 2, on the other hand, limits itself to normative analysis. Due to the absence of consensus among researchers regarding implications of policy-relevant parameters, the desirability of the BMAA is still an unsettled policy issue. The general purpose of this study has been to generate some further information on Japan's beef market. In pursuant of this objective, an attempt is made to (a) show how significant the beef quality issue is in evaluating that market, (b) test the market equilibrium hypothesis, and (c) upon the acceptance of the alternative (disequilibrium) hypothesis, estimate the structural parameters from a model specified in the light of imperfections in the market. This fills the void in previous studies. Drawing on existing literature, the beef quality categories are shown to have been narrowing and, in fact, converging to the two middle categories, medium and common grades. It is suggested that future market studies may benefit from concentrating on these two grades in assessing competitiveness and substitutability with domestic beef. Understanding the nature of this convergence (i. e whether the shift is attributable to changes in cost or preference structure) may contribute to sound policy making. Based on (a) increased concentration in production and distribution sectors, (b) government intervention in beef and related markets, (c) high degree heterogeneity in beef, and (d) short-run supply inflexibility due to long fattening period and restrictive import policy, the Japanese beef market was hypothesized to have been in disequilibria due to incomplete market information. In testing this hypothesis, two data sets were used -Statistical Yearbook and the Family Income and Expenditure Survey. For reference purposes, they are referred to as Market I and Market II respectively. The equilibrium hypothesis was tested for uniform and upward and downward differential adjustment speeds. The uniform adjustment rate estimated from the reduced form price equation supports the hypothesis in both markets. The structural equations were then adjusted in the light of the imperfections in the market and structural parameters estimated using non-linear three stage least squares. Both upward and downward adjustment speeds in Market I suggest perfect flexibility in prices on annual basis. In Market II, prices are found to have been flexible downward but rigid otherwise. The upward rigidity in prices suggest excess demand. Perfect flexibility in prices on annual basis however may not suggest market equilibrium in a period less than a year. Consumers are found to be more price responsive than in previous studies implying a greater response of the demand for beef imports to changes in prices due to the liberalization than envisaged by previous studies. The demand for beef however is income inelastic suggesting a partial offsetting in the incremental demand for imports. Finally, consumers respond to changes in beef retail prices by consuming less fish and poultry...|$|R

Project details: The project consists ofbuilding eight units each consisting of 10 family rooms that will allow a mother and her children to live comfortably as human beings. The length ofsay in the home will be between 12 and 24 months or until the woman is trained in a useful and productive occupation that will provide for her family needs and give her the opportunity to adjust to her new Status as a wonhwhile woman and not a slave in a patriarchal society. Once the woman is able to earn she will contribute to the family's living expenses and education. The Delhi Quotarians are committed to the building ofone of these homes to be called the Quota House. Once finished, it will be managed and financed by a women's organization, headed by Mrs. Tara Ali Baig, chief administrator ofwomen's affairs in Delhi and chiefadministrator ofS. O. S. villages in India. Background: The traditional role ofan Indian woman (the indoctrination begins in the cradle) is that she exists as a vassal ofman. She is the servant ofhis family, compelled by tradition to accept whatever treatment is meted out. Her whole life from the day of her marriage (often as a child) is set on a course ofserfdom. If her marriage fails, she has nowhere to go. The only escape for these abandoned and destitute creatures in the past has been suicide by immolation or the brothels.

Background: Since Sri Lanka is a country ofgreat poveny and illiteracy, the incidence ofdeafness is greater and the ability to overcome is less. Deafness does not evoke a sympathetic response at first Sight and eë 1 l physi­cians do not consider deafness as serious as other handicaps. This results in a double disability of lost hearing and speech and a resulting communication gap. Unlike blindness, the disabling aspect of deafness can be overcome ifproper steps are taken. We would like to initiate a deafscreening center in Sri Lanka. Objectives: 1. To prevent abnormal development in children due to deafness and dumbness at an early age and to promote optimal child health-physical, mental, and emotional-thus enabling Céry child to develop his or her full potential and overcome the disability. 2. To encourage deafness awareness in parents, interested persons. and agencies concerned with child care and development. 3.
