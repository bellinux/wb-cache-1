5|$|Oral stories {{continue}} {{the process of}} Sanskritization of Khandoba— his elevation from a folk deity to Shiva, a deity of the classical Hindu pantheon— that was initiated by the texts. Khandoba's wives Mhalsa and Banai are also identified with Shiva's classical Hindu wives Parvati and Ganga.

Other myth variants narrate that Khandoba defeats a single demon named Manimalla, who offers his white horse, sometimes called Mani, to the god. Other legends depict Mhalsa (or Parvati) and Banai or Banu (or Ganga) as futilely helping Khandoba in the battle to collect the blood of Mani, every drop of which was creating a new demon. Finally, the dog of Khandoba swallows all the blood. Sometimes, Mhalsa, or rarely Banai, is described as seated behind Khandoba on the horse and fighting with a sword or spear.|$|E

5000|$|For example, in English, [...] "then John hit his brother" [...] is more {{acceptable}} than [...] "then John's <b>brother</b> <b>was</b> hit by him".

In contrast, in the latter, John's <b>brother</b> <b>is</b> the subject and him (John) is the by-agent. Thus, since the speaker's empathy with the subject, John's <b>brother,</b> <b>is</b> less than with him (John), then John's <b>brother</b> <b>was</b> hit by him is less acceptable than the former phrase.|$|R
