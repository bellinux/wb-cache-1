[...] The initiation he offered was another such device: [...] "... if your being can communicate with me, it becomes a communion. … It is the highest form of communication possible: a transmission without words.

[...] Ultimately though, as an explicitly [...] "self-parodying" [...] guru, Rajneesh even deconstructed his own authority, declaring his teaching {{to be nothing more}} than a [...] "game" [...] or a joke. He emphasised that anything and everything could become an opportunity for meditation.|$|E
