5|$|SMS Helgoland, {{the lead}} ship of her class, was a {{dreadnought}} battleship of the German Imperial Navy. Helgolands design represented an incremental {{improvement over the}} preceding , including {{an increase in the}} <b>bore</b> <b>diameter</b> of the main guns, from 28cm (11in) to 30.5cm (12in). Her keel was laid down on 11 November 1908 at the Howaldtswerke shipyards in Kiel. Helgoland was launched on 25 September 1909 and was commissioned on 23 August 1911.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{would have}} been {{similarly}} equipped to the preceding Deutschland-class ships. The ships would have mounted six of the same /52 C/28 quick-firing guns in the same triple turret mounts. The guns had an actual <b>bore</b> <b>diameter</b> of , and fired both armor-piercing and high-explosive shells; both shells weighed 300kg (661.4lb). The guns used two sets of propellant charges: a 36.0kg (79.4lb) fore charge in a silk bag and a 71.0kg (156.6lb) main charge in a brass case. The shells were fired at 910meters per second (2,986fps), and at maximum elevation of 40degrees, a range of 36,475m (39,890yards). The guns had a rate of fire of 2.5 rounds per minute. However, eight guns were considered, had there been a quadruple turret available. The guns were supplied {{by a total of}} 900 shells, for a total of 150 rounds per gun.|$|E

40|$|Hylaeus basalis, H. ellipticus and H. verticalis nested in wooden traps {{during a}} two-year study in Upper Michigan. Bees {{were given a}} choice of traps with varying <b>bore</b> <b>diameters,</b> heights, and {{entrance}} orientations. Nests were completed between 1 July and 15 September. These three Hylaeus species partitioned available nest site resources (traps) based on diameter and height. H. ellipticus selected traps with smaller <b>bore</b> <b>diameters</b> than did the other two species which selected traps of the same <b>bore</b> <b>diameters.</b> H. verticalis nested in traps at higher locations than H. basalis which limited its nesting to only the two lowest heights available.

Public opinion polls show that for wooden structures, Koreans prefer post-and-beam type construction with structural timber and exposed structural members because of its good appearance.

To learn about the mechanical properties of skin timbers, we prepared various miniature skin timber specimens for pine and larch. Bored skin timber samples with five different <b>boring</b> <b>diameters</b> and non-bored sample specimens were used to determine their mechanical strength loss as a factor of the <b>boring</b> <b>diameter.</b> We found a relationship between strength characteristics and <b>boring</b> <b>diameter</b> that was highly significant statistically in the case of pine but not highly significant in the case of larch which has large variation in strength performances among groups. We developed a number of types of estimating equations for pine and larch, but a linear function was selected as the estimating equation for residual strength versus <b>boring</b> <b>diameter</b> because of its convenience. The coefficient of determination and regression equation were 0. 97, y=- 1. 7664 x+ 49. 046 for pine and those values for larch were 0. 87, y=- 2. 4285 x+ 68. 599, respectively.

25|$|The D-10 is a {{high-velocity}} gun of 100mm <b>bore</b> <b>diameter,</b> with {{a barrel}} length of 53.5 calibres. Muzzle velocity of 895m/s gave it good anti-tank performance by late-war standards. Initially it could penetrate about 164mm of steel armor plate at 1,000m range, {{superior to the}} German 75mm KwK 42 mounted on the Panther tank and the Tiger I's 88mm KwK 36 gun. Testing against Panther tanks at Kubinka showed the D-10T could penetrate the Panther's glacis up to 1500 m. This performance grew when APDS and more modern ammunition types were developed after the war. After the war a more effective high-explosive shell was also developed, {{taking advantage of the}} larger 100mm bore.|$|E

40|$|The {{influences}} of lanthanum and cerium doping {{on the performance}} of TiO 2 ultrafiltration membrane were investigated. The significant TiO 2 crystal structure change with the increase of calcination temperature could be effectively suppressed by lanthanum doping. Lanthanum and cerium doping could not only effectively control the particle and pore sizes in membrane layer, but also improved the acid and alkali resistance. TiO 2 membrane layers were obtained with particle sizes of 60 - 80 nm and <b>bore</b> <b>diameters</b> of 10 - 60 nm. Lanthanum and cerium doping TiO 2 membrane layers were obtained with particle sizes around 50 nm and <b>bore</b> <b>diameters</b> of 10 - 20 nm. In addition, the performance of lanthanum doping was better than cerium doping...|$|R
50|$|Some newer 12 gauge and 20 gauge Citori {{models have}} back-bored barrels.

Models with back-bored barrels use Invector Plus choke tubes.|$|R
25|$|Formula One cars use {{short stroke}} engines. These engines {{are common in}} racing {{motorcycles}} and streetbikes. The bore is {{the diameter of the}} cylinder in the engine block, and the stroke is the distance the piston travels from top dead-centre (TDC) to bottom dead-centre (BDC) inside the cylinder. To operate at high engine speeds the stroke must be relatively short to prevent catastrophic failure; this is usually connecting rod failure as the rod is under very large stresses at these speeds. Having a short stroke means that a relatively large bore is required to make the 1.6 litre engine displacement. This results in a less efficient combustion stroke, especially at lower rpm. The stroke of a Formula One engine is approximately , less than half the <b>bore</b> <b>diameter</b> , what is known as an over-square configuration.|$|E
