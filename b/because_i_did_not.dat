25|$|Bread and Alley was {{my first}} {{experience}} in cinema and I must say a very difficult one. I {{had to work with}} a very young child, a dog, and an unprofessional crew except for the cinematographer, who was nagging and complaining all the time. Well, the cinematographer, in a sense, was right <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> follow the conventions of film making that he had become accustomed to.|$|E

[...] He later recalled: [...] "I could not play quarterback for Coach Little, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> personify what he wanted. [...] Now, under Yost, I was the quarterback, and this game meant much to me." ...|$|E
500|$|In the season-ending RAC Rally in Great Britain, Mouton {{continued}} her good performances by running third at half distance, despite having been uncomfortable about competing in a rally where pacenotes and practice are not allowed. However, her Quattro later incurred gearbox problems and she retired from fifth place after sliding {{off the road}} into a snow-filled ditch. Mouton would later state: [...] "For me, rallying is England. No pacenotes – just you in the car having to do the fastest time. This, to me, is rallying. OK, {{it was not easy}} for me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have experience there of the British championship, but it is really rallying. I like it very much." [...] Mouton finished the season in eighth place in the drivers' championship, while Audi was fifth in the manufacturers' standings.|$|E

500|$|During {{the last}} years of his life, Hughes began working on a fuller {{publication}} of Plath's journals. In 1998, shortly before his death, he unsealed the two journals, and passed the project onto his children by Plath, Frieda and Nicholas, who passed it on to Karen V. Kukil. Kukil finished her editing in December 1999, and in 2000 Anchor Books published The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath (Plath 2000). More than half of the new volume contained newly released material; The American author Joyce Carol Oates hailed the publication as a [...] "genuine literary event". Hughes faced criticism for his role in handling the journals: he claims to have destroyed Plath's last journal, which contained entries from the winter of 1962 up to her death. In the foreword of the 1982 version, he writes, [...] "I destroyed [...] <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want her children to have to read it (in those days I regarded forgetfulness as an essential part of survival)." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the video}} Voris {{admitted}} {{it may have}} been a mistake on his part not to have brought this information to the public earlier, but that he did not feel it necessary to provide all the details in order to proclaim the Gospel. [...] "I did not do it to deceive, but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> understand the necessity. Now, I do," [...] he said. At the end of the video, he says, [...] "We will never cease to declare these truths, the glories of the Catholic faith, regardless of what happens. If this is all threatened because of revelations of my past sins, then please pray that the will of God be done. Thank you for your prayers, your support and your understanding, as well as the measure of forgiveness you are ready to extend." ...|$|E
2500|$|I must enjoy {{myself and}} tell you about Madame C. Royer who {{translated}} the Origin into French and for which 2d edition I took infinite trouble. She has now just brought out a 3d edition without informing me {{so that all the}} corrections to the 4th and 5th editions are lost. Besides her enormously long and blasphemous preface to the 1st edition she has added a 2nd preface abusing me like a pick-pocket for pangenesis which of course has no relation to Origin. Her motive being, I believe, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> employ her to translate [...] "Domestic animals". So I wrote to Paris; & Reinwald agrees to bring out at once a new translation for the 5th English Edition in Competition with her 3e edition [...] So shall I not serve her well? By the way this fact shows that [...] "evolution of species" [...] must at last be spreading in France.|$|E

2500|$|Walter Pincus, a Washington Post columnist, has {{reported}} that he was told in confidence by an unnamed Bush administration official on July 12, 2003, two days before Novak's column appeared, that [...] "the White House had not paid attention to former Ambassador Joseph Wilson's CIA-sponsored February 2002 trip to Niger because it was set up as a boondoggle by his wife, {{an analyst with the}} agency working on weapons of mass destruction." [...] Because he did not believe it to be true, Pincus claims, he did not report the story in The Washington Post until October 12, 2003: [...] "I wrote my October story <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> think the person who spoke to me was committing a criminal act, but only practicing damage control by {{trying to get me to}} stop writing about Wilson. Because of that article, The Washington Post and I received subpoenas last summer from Patrick J. Fitzgerald." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rather than {{accepting}} {{responsibility for}} a transgression through {{the form of an}} apology, a transgressor who explains why they engaged in a behavior is engaging in excuses or justifications. [...] While excuses and justifications aim to minimize blame on the transgressor, the two address blame minimization from completely opposite perspectives. Excuses attempt to minimize blame by focusing on a transgressor’s inability to control their actions (e.g., “How would I have known my exgirlfriend was {{going to be at the}} party.”) or displace blame on a third party (e.g., “I went to lunch with my exgirlfriend <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to hurt her feelings.”). [...] Conversely, a justification minimizes blame by suggesting that actions surrounding the transgression were justified or that the transgression was not severe. [...] For example, a transgressor may justify having lunch with a past romantic interest, suggesting to their current partner that the lunch meeting was of no major consequence (e.g., “We are just friends.”).|$|E
2500|$|Other {{legacies}} {{include the}} parents' beliefs in Freemasonry, Republicanism with elements of Anarchism and Marxism. Austere freethinkers with an intense {{hatred of the}} ruling National Fascist Party, Eva and Mario also refused to give their sons any education in the Catholic Faith or any other religion. Italo attended the English nursery school St George's College, followed by a Protestant elementary private school run by Waldensians. His secondary schooling, with a classical lyceum curriculum, was completed at the state-run Liceo Gian Domenico Cassini where, at his parents' request, he was exempted from religion classes but frequently asked to justify his anti-conformism to teachers, janitors, and fellow pupils. In his mature years, Calvino described the experience as having made him [...] "tolerant of others' opinions, particularly {{in the field of}} religion, remembering how irksome it was to hear myself mocked <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> follow the majority's beliefs". In 1938, Eugenio Scalfari, who went on to found the weekly magazine L'Espresso and La Repubblica, a major Italian newspaper, came from Civitavecchia to join the same class though a year younger, and they shared the same desk. The two teenagers formed a lasting friendship, Calvino attributing his political awakening to their university discussions. Seated together [...] "on a huge flat stone {{in the middle of a}} stream near our land", he and Scalfari founded the MUL (University Liberal Movement).|$|E
