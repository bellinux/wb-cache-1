5|$|Elements of the {{division}} fought briefly against Soviet forces in southern Hungary in early October 1944 alongside the 31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division. They were soon disengaged from the front line in Hungary and had <b>begun</b> <b>a</b> move to the German puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia, to join the 13th SS Division when the Bosnian Muslim soldiers of the Kama division mutinied on 17 October 1944. The cadre quickly regained control, but the mutiny resulted in {{the division}} being formally dissolved on 31 October 1944.|$|E
5|$|George Hall and {{his family}} arrived in the New South Wales Colony in 1802. By 1825, the Halls had {{established}} two cattle stations in the Upper Hunter Valley, and had <b>begun</b> <b>a</b> northward expansion into the Liverpool Plains, New England and Queensland. Getting his cattle to the Sydney markets presented a problem in that thousands of head of cattle had to be moved for thousands of kilometres along unfenced stock routes through sometimes rugged bush and mountain ranges. A note, in his own writing, records Thomas Hall's anger at losing 200 head in scrub.|$|E
5|$|Holt {{tractors}} {{were widely}} used as artillery tractors during World War I and their capabilities and reliability had become well-known. Benjamin Holt also gained valuable experience securing government contracts. These capabilities separated {{him from his}} competition.

5|$|In 1886, when Jacques van Marken was in France at a spa, Agneta Matthes found {{a letter}} from Maria Eringaard {{requesting}} the child support that he owed for their children, which led to Matthes discovering {{that her husband had}} <b>begun</b> <b>a</b> relationship with Eringaard in 1871 when she was aged 15, and that he had four children by her. Matthes solved the financial problems discreetly. She did not tell van Markem that she knew about the affair until 1889, when Eringaard died of tuberculosis, as had two of her children.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} when exactly Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet. Juliet's nurse {{refers to an}} {{earthquake}} she says occurred 11 years ago. This may refer to the Dover Straits earthquake of 1580, which would date that particular line to 1591. Other earthquakes—both in England and in Verona—have been proposed {{in support of the}} different dates. But the play's stylistic similarities with A Midsummer Night's Dream and other plays conventionally dated around 1594–95, place its composition sometime between 1591 and 1595. One conjecture is that Shakespeare may have <b>begun</b> <b>a</b> draft in 1591, which he completed in 1595.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan has {{recently}} <b>begun</b> <b>a</b> {{relationship with an}} old acquaintance, Nicola (Katherine Parkinson), who is opposed to his investigative career, believing it to be too dangerous an occupation.

5|$|Kauri gum {{was used}} commercially in varnish, {{and can be}} {{considered}} a type of copal (the name given to resin used in such a way). Kauri gum was found to be particularly good for this, and from the mid-1840s was exported to London and America. Tentative exports had <b>begun</b> <b>a</b> few years earlier, however, for use in marine glue and as fire-kindlers; gum had even made up part of an export cargo to Australia in 1814.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{announcement}} of the joint rally, supporters of the movement for a Colbert-led march had <b>begun</b> <b>a</b> drive to raise money for educational charities through DonorsChoose.org, a charitable organization of which Colbert {{is a member of the}} Board of Directors.

5|$|The {{reinforced}} North Koreans {{had advanced}} on the 25th Infantry Division defensive line and had <b>begun</b> <b>a</b> series of probing attacks {{that were to}} continue throughout the month, sometimes of battalion strength. Most of these attacks came in the high mountains west of Haman, in the Battle Mountain, P'il-bong, and Sobuk-san area. There the 6th Division attacked any UN-held terrain features that afforded observation of its supply and concentration area in the deeply cut valley to the west.|$|E

5|$|As {{the houses}} in the Ghetto age, and {{as the number of}} {{students}} wishing to live in the Ghetto expands, the university has <b>begun</b> <b>a</b> renovation and replacement program with the goal of keeping the current feel of the area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill land that was unused, resulting in housing for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed six students per side, for a total of 12 students each. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and replacing them with a new five-person design. Several more of these houses have now been built throughout the Ghetto.|$|E
5|$|By September 23, Jeanne had <b>begun</b> <b>a</b> slow westward motion, {{with its}} {{previously}} well-defined eye becoming ragged. It moved slowly over waters it traversed {{just four days}} prior, causing upwelling; this is the process in which a stationary storm causes the water temperatures to decrease by bringing the cooler, deeper waters to the surface. As a result, Jeanne weakened to a minimal hurricane midday on September 23, though it was forecast to re-intensify and attain major hurricane status. By early on September 24, the winds had decreased to 80mph (130km/h); its convection weakened in intensity, and the eyewall eroded due to dry air entrainment. However, as Jeanne moved toward an area of warmer waters, deep convection redeveloped around the eye. Its favorable upper-level environment allowed the outflow to become better defined, with a large eye and nearby dry air being the primary restraining factors for development. At 1200UTC on September 25, Jeanne attained major hurricane status, and two hours later it made landfall on Abaco Island.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the central}} {{pressure}} of the depression had decreased to 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg) and gale-force winds were recorded over a large area, and the system was upgraded to a tropical storm that morning. The system was {{compared to that of}} a Kona low, a large-scale subtropical cyclone that forms near Hawaii. Early on November2, the storm turned northwest in response to an area of high pressure over the central Atlantic. Later that day, the first scientific mission into a hurricane with two planes took place when two research aircraft flew into Greta. During the day, an Air Force B-50 aircraft and NHRP B-47 high altitude jet flew into the storm. The storm executed a counter-clockwise loop, ending on November3, during which time numerous reconnaissance missions were flown into the system. By this time, the storm had also <b>begun</b> <b>a</b> southeastward track.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{feud with}} Rivadavia, who was {{appointed}} President of Argentina, San Martín offered his military services in the War with Brazil, but received no response. He sailed to the country when Rivadavia was deposed and replaced by the federal Manuel Dorrego, and the war ended in the interim. He intended to return anyway, as a federal government would spare him the persecution he would otherwise have received from the unitarians. He was unable to do as he planned. When his ship docked in Río de Janeiro he was informed that the unitarian Juan Lavalle had deposed Dorrego, and when he reached Montevideo he was informed that Lavalle had captured and executed Dorrego and <b>begun</b> <b>a</b> campaign of terror against all federals in the country. The ship arrived in Buenos Aires, but San Martín did not leave it, instead returning to Montevideo. Lavalle was unable {{to put down the}} federal rebellion against him, and offered San Martín the government. San Martín declined and returned to Brussels.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{resignation}} from the Senate, Pierce {{had no intention}} of leaving public life. The move to Concord had given him more opportunities for cases, and allowed Jane a more robust community life. Jane had remained in Concord with her young son Frank and her newborn Benjamin for the latter part of Pierce's Senate term, and this separation had taken a toll on the family. Pierce, meanwhile, had <b>begun</b> <b>a</b> demanding but lucrative law partnership with Asa Fowler during congressional recesses. Pierce returned to Concord in early 1842, and his reputation as a lawyer continued to flourish. Known for his gracious personality, eloquence, and excellent memory, Pierce would attract large audiences to hear him in court. He would often represent poor people for little or no compensation.|$|E
5|$|French privateering {{attacks against}} American vessels, <b>begun</b> <b>a</b> year prior, caused the {{conflict}} between the United States and France. An American squadron under Commodore Thomas Truxtun had been sent to patrol the Caribbean waters between Puerto Rico and Saint Kitts with orders to engage any French forces they found in the area. While Truxtun was sailing independently of his squadron in Constellation, his flagship, he met and engaged L'Insurgente. After chasing the French ship through a storm, Constellation forced L'Insurgente into an engagement that lasted an hour and fourteen minutes before the French frigate surrendered. The French sustained heavy casualties in the action, while the numbers of American dead and wounded were low.|$|E
