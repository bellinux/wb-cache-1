40|$|For three pigeons, {{reinforcement}} {{depended upon}} a left side-key response after {{execution of a}} fixed ratio 10 on the center key, and upon a right side-key response after fixed ratio 20. Each response during the fixed ratios produced a 0. 5 -sec blackout. <b>The</b> time <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> last response in fixed ratio 10 was then equated with <b>the</b> time <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> last response in fixed ratio 20 by increasing the blackout duration. The accuracy of side-key choice was disrupted, thereby suggesting that time, rather than number of responses, controlled choice responding. When <b>the</b> time <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> last response was equated during both ratios, asymptotic accuracy was approximately equal to (two birds) or somewhat higher than (one bird) that obtained previously. The results of probes with intermediate fixed ratios and blackouts suggested that control of side-key choice had transferred from <b>the</b> time <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> last response in ratios to blackout duration...|$|R

5|$|In the English Civil War, Thomas Bushell held Lundy for King Charles I, {{rebuilding}} Marisco Castle and garrisoning {{the island}} {{at his own}} expense.

Brugge had won the 1975–76 Belgian First Division; they won the competition by four points from second-place Anderlecht.

The game was first released on October 6, 2009, in North America and was released later that year in other regions. The Microsoft Windows version was released on October 22, 2009.

5|$|To be an {{automatic}} process, the effect should, for each specific person, be fairly stable over time.

5|$|Billy Bonds is {{the only}} manager to have managed both clubs. He {{was in charge of}} West Ham from February 1990 to August 1994, {{managing}} the club for 227 games as the team yo-yoed <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>and</b> <b>Second</b> divisions. He guided them to two promotions and one relegation. He resigned in August 1994. He was appointed as Millwall manager in May 1997 by chairman Theo Paphitis— an unpopular decision with many Lions fans due to his West Ham allegiance. Bonds, from south London, had several family members who were Millwall fans; a fact which meant some supporters felt he should be given a chance. After a good start, the team narrowly avoided relegation, finishing 18th in the Second Division. Bonds was sacked in May 1998, having been in charge of the side for only 53 games.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War Era, the {{relationships}} between the First World, Second World and the Third World were very rigid. The First World and Second World were at constant odds with one another via the tensions between their two cores, the United States and the Soviet Union, respectively. The Cold War, by virtue of its name, was a primarily ideological struggle <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>and</b> <b>Second</b> Worlds, or more specifically, the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Multiple doctrines and plans dominated Cold War dynamics including the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan (from the U.S) and the Molotov Plan (from the Soviet Union). The extent of the odds between the two worlds is evident in Berlin—which was then split into East and West. To stop citizens in East Berlin from having too much exposure to the capitalist West, the Soviet Union put up the Berlin Wall within the actual city.|$|E
30|$|There {{may have}} been {{clinical}} <b>and</b> socio-demographic differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> multiple episode groups, which could have had independent effects on outcome (Berk et al. 2011; Tohen et al. 2010) whether these were measured or not. Confounders, such as age, have been controlled for in some analyses and significant differences remain <b>between</b> <b>the</b> groups (Franchini et al. 1999; Rosa et al. 2012). In other studies, despite striking absolute differences in outcome (e.g., employment) <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> multiple admission groups, admission number did not remain significant after controlling for other factors (Jiang 1999). Variable adjustment for confounding and disparate analytic strategies (due {{to the nature of}} studies included) means that caution is needed in direct comparisons between studies.|$|R
