40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to (1) estimate the effects of polyculture of <b>blue</b> <b>shrimp</b> Litopenaeus stylirostris with goldlined rabbitfish Siganus lineatus on production, environmental quality and water and sediment metabolism and (2) to determine if <b>blue</b> <b>shrimp</b> and goldlined rabbitfish polyculture is possible. The experiment was carried out for 12 weeks in a mesocosm system that consisted of 12 circular outdoor mesocosm fiberglass tanks (1. 7 m 2, 1275 L water volume). Shrimp (2. 9 g) were randomly stocked at density of 15 shrimp. m− 2 without rabbitfish (control), with rabbitfish (25. 5 g) at low density (1. 2 fish. m− 2) (LDRB) and high density (2. 4 fish. m− 2) (HDRB). Results indicated that goldlined rabbitfish S. lineatus did not affect shrimp growth performance. At the end of the experiment, the combined shrimp and rabbitfish yields in the LDRB (213 g. m− 2) treatment and the HDRB (295 g. m− 2) treatment were significantly greater (P 0. 05) in gross primary productivity and respiration between the HDRB treatment and the control.

40|$|Abstract-l. The <b>blue</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Penaeus tylirostris) {{haemolymph}} {{is capable}} of agglutinating the red blood cells of several vertebrates to different titres.

40|$|International audienceThe present work {{aimed at}} better {{understanding}} metal and metalloid bioaccumulation in the edible Pacific <b>blue</b> <b>shrimp</b> Litopenaeus stylirostris, using both laboratory and field approaches. In the laboratory, the bioaccumulation kinetics of Ag, Cd, Co, Cr, and Zn {{have been investigated}} in shrimp exposed via seawater and food, using the corresponding γ-emitting radiotracers (110 mAg, 109 Cd, 57 Co, 51 Cr, and 65 Zn) and highly sensitive nuclear detection techniques. Results showed that hepatopancreas and intestine concentrated the metals to the highest extent among the <b>blue</b> <b>shrimp</b> organs and tissues. Moulting was found to play a non negligible detoxification role for Co, Cr and, to a lesser extent, Zn. Metal retention by L. stylirostris widely varied (from {{a few days to}} several months), according to the element and exposure pathway considered (a given metal was usually less strongly retained when ingested with food than when it was taken up from the dissolved phase). In the field study, Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn were analysed in shrimp collected from a New Caledonian aquaculture pond. Metal concentrations in the shrimp muscles were generally relatively low and results confirmed the role played by the digestive organs and tissues in the bioaccumulation/storage/detoxification of metals in the Pacific <b>blue</b> <b>shrimp.</b> Preliminary risk considerations indicate that consumption of the shrimp farmed in New Caledonia is not of particular concern for human health...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of different oxygen concentrations on the bioenergetics parameters, osmoregulatory capacity and O:N atomic {{ratio of the}} <b>blue</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Litopenaeus stylirostris (Stimpson), was determined under laboratory conditions; shrimp were acclimated at 28 ºC and 25 psu and exposed to three different oxygen concentrations 2, 4 and 6 mg L- 1. The critical oxygen level (COL) was determined at 5. 5 mg L- 1. Growth, oxygen consumption (R), ammonium excretion (U), scope for growth (P) and apparent heat increment (AHI) were affected significantly (P < 0. 05) when the organisms were exposed at different oxygen concentrations. The highest energy invested for routine metabolism and ammonium excretion was obtained in the animals maintained at 2 mg L- 1. The exposure of organisms to oxygen concentration (2 mg L- 1 increased three times the feces production (23. 59 %). The high quantity of energy channeled to scope for growth (2756 J g 1 day- 1 d. w.) was obtained in the shrimp acclimated to an oxygen concentration of 6 mg L- 1. The O:N atomic ratio calculated for the juveniles indicated a catabolism of proteins for the organisms maintained in the lowest oxygen concentration. In the oxygen concentrations of 2 and 4 mg L- 1 the <b>blue</b> <b>shrimp</b> juveniles modified their osmoregulatory capacity (OC) changing the osmoregulatory pattern the isosmotic to hypo-osmotic. We recommend maintaining Litopenaeus stylirostris at 6 mg L- 1 and (25 psu), these conditions for <b>blue</b> <b>shrimp</b> juveniles would enhance production in the cultivation of this species...|$|E

The high quantity of energy channeled to scope for growth 2757 J g- 1 day- 1 d. w. was obtained in the shrimp acclimated to a salinity of 25 psu. The apparent heat increment fecal production and energy lost in exuviae {{did not differ significantly}} (P> 0. 05) among the shrimp exposed to the three salinity levels. The O:N atomic ratio calculated for the juveniles indicated a catabolism of carbohydrates as the main energy substrate for the organisms maintained in the isosmotic condition (25 psu).

40|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{disease is}} one of the main {{problems}} in tiger shrimp culture. It reduces shrimp quality which eventually will decrease its market price. <b>Blue</b> <b>shrimp</b> is caused by deficiency of nutrition and additive materials such as carotene and other nutrient which function as vitamin source for important metabolic processes and formation of color profile in shrimp and fish. The aims of this study were to study the application effect of carotenoid extract of sponge Callyspongia basilana, as an additive material on the ability of shrimp to get back to normal state after suffering <b>blue</b> <b>shrimp</b> disease and survival rate of shrimp and to find out the optimal concentration of sponge carotenoid extract to cure the diseased shrimp. This study was consisted of two steps namely; (1). Extraction of sponge carotenoid by maseration and fractionation using acetone and petroleum ether solvents and (2), the application of carotenoid extract on the diseased shrimp. The research was arranged in a complete randomized design with four experiments consisted of (A). Control (without carotenoid extract); (B),(C), and (D) carotetoid extract addition of 3 mg/L, 6 mg/L, and 9 mg/L respectively with three replication each.

40|$|The {{co-culture}} {{of juvenile}} sea cucumber Holothuria scabra (Jaeger), or ‘sandfish’, with juvenile <b>blue</b> <b>shrimp</b> Litopenaeus stylirostris (Stimpson) was tested by growing groups in co-culture and monoculture for 3 weeks in tanks with enriched sand substratum. Feed was supplied on trays, accessible only to shrimp. Survival of shrimp and sandfish was high in all treatments (73 – 100 %). Growth of shrimp {{did not differ}} between monoculture and co-culture, but sandfish grew significantly slower in co-culture (P= 0. 03), although their sand burying and surface foraging were apparently unaffected by shrimp (P= 0. 76). However, shrimp increased the levels of total ammonia-N in tanks, which related inversely with sandfish growth (P= 0. 04). Conversely, sandfish {{did not appear to}} lower the water quality for shrimp culture. While sandfish bioturbate sediments and eat organic deposits, the juveniles did not significantly reduce the organic content of sand in tanks. Co-culturing juveniles of the two species in earthen ponds appears feasible, with no detriment to shrimp production, presenting a cost-effective method for growing sandfish to larger sizes for restocking.

After 30 days of rearing, juvenile shrimps were exposed to H 2 O 2 stress at a concentration of 30 ppm during 6 hours. The oxidative stress caused by H 2 O 2 was examined in the digestive glands of the shrimp, in which antioxidant enzyme (AOE) and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) gene expression were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR. Results showed that rearing conditions {{did not affect the}} expression of genes encoding AOEs or AMPs. However, H 2 O 2 stress induced a differential response in expression between shrimps from the two rearing treatments (BFT and CW). Comparative analysis of the expression profiles indicates that catalase transcripts were significantly upregulated by H 2 O 2 stress for BFT shrimps while no change was observed for CW shrimps. In contrast, H 2 O 2 caused down-regulation of superoxide dismutase and glutathione transferase transcripts and of the three AMP transcripts studied (penaeidin 2 and 3, and crustin) for CW shrimps, while no effect was observed on BFT shrimp transcript levels. These results suggested that BFT shrimps maintained antioxidant and AMP responses after stress and therefore can effectively protect their cells against oxidative stress, while CW shrimp immune competence seems to decrease after stres...|$|R
