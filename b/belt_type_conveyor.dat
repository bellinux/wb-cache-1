40|$|Objectives: This paper {{suggests}} the experimental guidelines {{to evaluate the}} electro-mechanical safety of <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> equipment. The electro-mechanical safety was determined by using the International Electrotechnical Commission guidelines, which are widely used as important factors for assessing the electro-mechanical safety of <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> equipment. However, the local guidelines on wearable healthcare sensors are currently not well-established. Therefore, safety guidelines suited for the actual circumstances in Korea are required, and this paper attempts to try a new experimental safety test procedure of the wearable healthcare sensor. Methods: This <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> device measures the electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rates by attaching to the chest. Examination lists were selected by analyzing the common standards ofelectro-mechanical safety (IEC 60601 - 1) and environment tests (IEC 60068 - 1, IEC 60068 - 2) of home-healthcare equipment. Results: The essential electrical safety, which was required for the RS 300 G 3 as a medical device, was evaluated, {{and most of the}} examination lists were selected by considering the circumstances of the users. The device passed all the selected examinable lists that are applicable to the Korean environment. Conclusions: This study has limitations to estimate and to conduct electro-mechanical safety experiments because our study focused on the <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> of heart-rates equipment. We are not taking into account the overall electro-mechanical home-healthcare measurements. According to industrial and technological development, there are infinite possibilities for the advancement of home-healthcare equipment, so more examination lists for safety are being added in addition to what w...|$|R

40|$|Issue: A {{wood waste}} {{processing}} facility requires that conveyor systems efficiently transport material between different machine centers, screening systems, and contaminant removal systems. The appropriate equipment for handling basic material depends on wood waste materials specific characteristics. Since wood waste {{is usually not}} uniform in size, and since the material characteristics change after different stages of processing, a given processing facility will use several <b>types</b> of <b>conveyor</b> equipment. Selecting the appropriate <b>type</b> of <b>conveyor</b> is essential in order to: • balance material flow through machine centers and systems; • avoid back-ups, spill-overs, and resulting clean-up requirements; • avoid unnecessary equipment maintenance or plant down-time; • maintain appropriate orientation of the material; • operate compatibly with other process equipment and systems; • accommodate the abrasive properties of wood.

40|$|Abstract [...] - Automation is the {{technology}} that helps in meeting the increasing pace of development and industrialization. The increasing demand of productivity in terms of quality and quantity, increase in pressure for meeting the deadlines and the decrease in the availability of cheap labour {{has led to a}} tremendous increase in the research and development of the different tools that automate the production either directly or indirectly. The aim of our work is to design, fabricate and analyse the performance of a magnetic <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> feeder, which feeds the ferromagnetic parts in desired orientation and feed rate. A physical prototype of a <b>conveyor</b> <b>type</b> magnetic feeder was constructed and the feeding behaviour was studied experimentally by varying the input parameters such as speed of conveying, number of magnets and part population. Analysis was done by feeding cylindrical parts with large diameter to length ratio. The profile of the chute helps in orienting the parts along their length which is difficult to orient by conventional feeders. A study on the experimental setup was performed and conclusions were drawn about the effect of various parameters on the feed rate...|$|R

40|$|An {{automated}} {{high bay}} warehouse {{is commonly used}} for storing large number of material with a high throughput. In an automated warehouse pallet movements are mainly performed {{by a number of}} automated devices like conveyors systems, trolleys, and stacker cranes. From the introduction of the material to the automated warehouse system to its dispatch the system requires no operator input or intervention since all material movements are done automatically. This allows the automated warehouse to operate continuously with minimal manpower. The thesis focuses on a conveyor system within an automated warehouse. The conveyor system is responsible for the intake of material into the warehouse, internal use of material in the production, and dispatch of finished products. The material is stored on pallets, which are used to transport the material over different <b>types</b> of <b>conveyors.</b> The main contribution of the thesis is a software written for a programmable logic controller, which allows an arbitrary configuration of a conveyor system. The software is modular and consists of several so-called function blocks, where each function block represents the whole program logic for a single conveyor and uses a standard interface for information exchange with other function blocks. The software currently supports eight different <b>types</b> of <b>conveyors,</b> which can be freely linked with one another to create a conveyor system, of any size and complexity. The software allows for simple extension of existing project, and rapid development of new projects. To add a new <b>type</b> of <b>conveyor</b> only we need to create a new function block, which is following the now established standards for information exchange and supports all functionalities of the new <b>conveyor</b> <b>type.</b> The software is used on the conveyor system which consists of one hundred forty units.

40|$|Abstract. Along {{with the}} rapid {{development}} of chemical industry and the progress of science and technology, there exist safety risks for {{a large number of}} risk source pipelines. On the basis of the conventional containment measures for risk source leakage, this paper designed two types of emergency devices and corresponding rapid closure methods. One type is the pipeline leak sealing airbag inside the risk source. It is constituted by sealing institutions, diversion institutions, keep institutions and fixed institution. During the work, the sealing airbag gets inflated to realize the rapid closure inside in the piping. It is applicable to the sealing of the heat, water supply, the chemical pipeline, and even large pipe leakages. It also provides the diversion function. The second type the external leakage sealing gasbag for the risk source pipelines. It is compositioned by the <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> rubber air mattress,left and right sides of adjustable bits semi-manipulator mechanism. It is mounted using the <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> rubber layers of tilt superposition around in pipe outside. When needed the air gets inflated inside the gasbag, making each layer of air cushion tension bridle and mutual extruding, to execute rapid closure for the pipeline leakage. These two types of devices are easy to carry, require low professional training, while are highly efficient for the fast closure of the pipeline leakages...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare postures of male and female vehicle occupants, tested in both front seat positions, during normal driving and {{deceleration}} onset. These data are useful for the development and initialisation of computational human body models. A secondary aim was to examine the effect of reversible, motorised seat belts in these events. Kinematics were analysed for volunteers driving on rural roads, prior to autonomous braking (11 m/s 2 deceleration). Two restraint configurations were tested: a standard versus a motorized belt, activated 200 ms before braking initiation. Kinematic metric comparison via ANCOVA was performed to understand postural differences across gender, role (driver/passenger), and <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> (standard/motorised). Data was analysed prior to and at vehicle deceleration, termed typical riding and initial braking, respectively. While males and females displayed similar postures during typical riding, differences existed between drivers and passengers, especially with respect to neck posture. Drivers displayed more protracted neck postures, with significantly smaller (by 22 ‐ 27 mm, depending on gender) head‐to‐sternum horizontal distances, than passengers. Motorised belts significantly changed posture during initial braking, notably of the chest (which was shifted posteriorly by approximately 13 mm, depending on gender and role), while standard belts did not. Within a given <b>belt</b> <b>type,</b> occupants’ change in posture was similar across gender and role during initial braking...|$|R
50|$|The main subprocesses of sensor-based sorting are {{material}} conditioning, material presentation, detection, {{data processing}} and separation. Material conditioning includes all operations which prepare the particles for being detected by the sensor. All optical sensors need clean material {{to be able}} to detect optical characteristics. Conditioning includes screening and cleaning of the feed material. The aim of the material presentation is the isolation of the particles by creating a single particle layer with the densest surface cover possible without particles touching each other and enough distance to each other allowing for a selective detection and rejection of each single particle. There are two types of sensor-based sorters: the chute <b>type</b> and the <b>belt</b> <b>type.</b> For both types the first step in acceleration is spreading out the particles by a vibrating feeder followed by either a fast belt or a chute. On the <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> the sensor usually detects the particles horizontally while they pass it on the belt. For the chute type the material detection is usually done vertically while the material passes the sensor in a free fall. The data processing is done in real time by a computer. The computer transfers the result of the data processing to an ultra fast ejection unit which, depending on the sorting decision, ejects a particle or lets it pass.|$|R
