40|$|<b>Bycatch,</b> or the {{unintended}} capture of fish, marine mammals, sea turtles, and seabirds by fishing gear, occurs {{to some degree}} in most fisheries. The recently released National Marine Fisheries Service’s (NMFS) U. S. National <b>Bycatch</b> Report provides information on <b>bycatch</b> in U. S. commercial fisheries by fishery and species. The report also provides national statistics {{in the form of}} national <b>bycatch</b> ratio and a national <b>bycatch</b> estimate. We describe the methods used to develop these statistics and compare them to similar studies. We conclude that the national <b>bycatch</b> ratio and national <b>bycatch</b> estimates developed by NMFS represent the best available information on <b>bycatch</b> in U. S. fisheries. However, given changes in <b>bycatch</b> management over time, as well as inter-annual variability in <b>bycatch</b> levels and a high percentage of fisheries for which data on <b>bycatch</b> are not currently available, we recommend that NMFS continue to support <b>bycatch</b> data collection and reporting efforts to improve {{the quality and quantity of}} <b>bycatch</b> data and estimates available to fisheries managers and scientists over time.

40|$|Research PaperFisheries {{managers}} {{around the}} world have identified <b>bycatch</b> as a key management challenge in fisheries today. However, like the classic common property open-access problem in fisheries, a limit on fleet-wide <b>bycatch</b> may have similar consequences for fishing practices since <b>bycatch</b> is a common property open-access resource. If avoiding <b>bycatch</b> is costly, then it is not in any one fisherman's interest to avoid <b>bycatch</b> when others in the fleet are certain not to do so. Collectively, individual efforts to exploit lucrative <b>bycatch</b> areas lead to shortened season lengths and a loss in fleet-wide profitability. This occurs even before quotas on the target species become binding. Some have argued that information can partly overcome this race to exploit high <b>bycatch</b> areas since avoiding <b>bycatch</b> requires a coordinated fleet effort that in many cases is not possible because of limited information on spatial <b>bycatch</b> rates. The Alaskan flatfish fishery provides an interesting natural experiment in which to examine how information provision on <b>bycatch</b> has impacted every day choices by commercial fishermen. Since <b>bycatch</b> is known to occur in predictable spatial patterns and since gear in the flatfish fishery is not selective, the spatial choice reveals a great deal about fishermen's intentions concerning <b>bycatch</b> avoidance. Because season lengths were being restricted due to <b>bycatch</b> quotas, SEASTATE was initiated in 1995 to coordinate the sharing of <b>bycatch</b> information in order to facilitate the avoidance of <b>bycatch</b> species. Using haul-level data from on-board observers on catch and <b>bycatch</b> rates, we test a number of hypotheses on the role of information in addressing the incentive problems associated with <b>bycatch</b> using spatial site-choice models. These hypotheses include whether fishermen avoid high <b>bycatch</b> areas more following the SEASTATE program, and whether the program eliminates the open access problem completely...|$|R

25|$|EU {{legislation}} currently {{states that}} there are total allowable catches for each species, which are sub-divided between European Union member states, the intention {{of which is to}} conserve fish stocks. The individual countries then use this figure as a basis for quota allocation to individual fishermen or fishermens organisations. The quota rules however require that any fish which is caught outside quota allowances or below minimum landing size be discarded and that it is an offence for a fishing vessel to be carrying on board any fish for which it does not have a valid quota or which is outside regulated size limits. This is an example of discarding practice being driven by political considerations. Years after difficult negotiations between stakeholders and member states, the EU updated the Common Fisheries Policy and included in Article 15 the Landing Obligation (Discard ban). Until 2019 the law will be implemented progressively. The Landing Obligation does not allow the fisher to land <b>bycatches,</b> it is the obligation to do so. All species subject to an regulation like catch quotas or minimum sizes, have to be landed. However, these landings are not feasible for direct human consumption and are therefore expected {{to be used in the}} fishmeal industry.

40|$|Regulations {{to reduce}} <b>bycatch</b> of non-marketed marine species often impose gear restrictions, {{reductions}} in harvest {{of the target}} species, and/or spatial and temporal closures of the fishing ground.

Harvest of a target fish species, costly avoidance of the <b>bycatch</b> species, and harvesting efficiency are examined in a stochastic production environment with and without at-sea observability of <b>bycatch,</b> and with and without trade in harvest quotas and <b>bycatch</b> caps. Our results suggest that precise implementation of a socially optimal management plan is possible only if <b>bycatch</b> is observable and trade in fish quotas and <b>bycatch</b> cap is frictionless.

40|$|Copyright © 2007 CSIROThe {{effectiveness}} of two monitoring programs, designed {{to describe and}} quantify the <b>bycatch</b> from commercial pots, was examined in the South Australian rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) fishery (SARLF). The first, logbook sampling, relied on information collected and recorded by fishers in logbooks. The second, <b>bycatch</b> sampling, required fishers to collect <b>bycatch</b> specimens on a nominated day for later scientific analysis. A total of 40 <b>bycatch</b> species were recorded during the study. Finfish, mainly blue-throat wrasse (Notolabrus tetricus) and leather jacket species (Meuschenia hippocrepis and Meushenia australis), were the major component (> 90 % by number). Data from the logbook program were appropriate for monitoring spatio-temporal trends in <b>bycatch,</b> whereas the <b>bycatch</b> sampling provided more accurate information on <b>bycatch</b> species.

40|$|<b>Bycatch</b> is {{a nearly}} {{universal}} problem for fisheries, {{and it is}} increasingly common to place strict limits on allowable <b>bycatch</b> either on individuals or an industry sector.

40|$|International audienceBycatches {{appear to}} be one of the main causes of man-induced {{mortality}} of dolphins and porpoises in the Bay of Biscay. However bycatch estimations for common dolphins vary between 550 (observer-based estimate) and 4700 (stranding-based estimate) per year in the area depending on the methodological choice. In addition to problematic monitoring, mitigation measures as the use of pingers have been inefficient in French waters. Consequently, improving the understanding of interactions between small cetaceans and fisheries remains a challenge. This paper describes how divergent scientific estimations of cetacean <b>bycatches</b> can affect interactions between stakeholders. By using the Actor-Network Theory, we focused on scientific and managerial instruments translating small cetacean <b>bycatches</b> in the Bay of Biscay. According to this social science perspective, instruments are not neutral and play a central role in defining how stakeholders look at an issue. Translating observations into an aggregated number of <b>bycatches</b> is an expression of power relationships and is closely linked to stakeholders’ legitimacy. Similarly, voting a directive on the use of pingers conveys some parties’ perspective on the issue. Stakeholders strategies were shown to be influenced by divergent scientific estimations especially if some stakeholders i. e. fishermen or NGOs are not sufficiently involved in the process. Indeed, two different perspectives of the same phenomenon facilitate the controversy and thus reveal the variety of actors’ perspectives. Integrating the various stakeholders’ viewpoints on small cetacean <b>bycatches</b> is therefore necessary to improve stakeholders’ mobilization and so move towards a shared definition of the issue. To conclude, getting a sharper picture of small cetacean <b>bycatches</b> implies being able to include stakeholders’ strategies and representations of the system.

40|$|Many shark {{species have}} global {{distributions}} and are caught incidentally {{in different types}} of fisheries. Over the last two decades, shark populations have declined tremendously, {{with one of the}} leading causes of this decline <b>bycatch</b> in primarily teleost fisheries. <b>Bycatch</b> occurs throughout the world’s fisheries, but is not well documented in terms of species composition and numbers of each species captured. Information on shark <b>bycatch</b> is spread through the primary and grey literature, but has not been compiled in summary to date. The goal of my capstone is to present global shark <b>bycatch</b> data and provide a comparative review to determine fishery types that affect shark populations and identify shark species at risk as a result of <b>bycatch.</b> Longline fisheries caught a larger variety of shark species, and the post-release mortality was generally low. In contrast, trawl fisheries caught mostly the same few species, but post-release mortality was extremely high. Blue sharks (Prionace glauca), silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis), and spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) were caught most often in trawl fisheries, and in large numbers that likely adds to risk of overexploitation of their populations. This literature review revealed a severe lack of standardization in <b>bycatch</b> data reporting by different fishing nations, and in documents prepared by management agencies and scientists, including the definition of <b>bycatch</b> used and the way it was recorded. Establishing a universal definition of <b>bycatch</b> and standardizing its reporting would vastly improve ability to assess the scale and composition of shark <b>bycatch</b> and its impacts on shark populations.
