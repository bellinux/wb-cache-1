50|$|When V-1 attacks {{began in}} mid-June 1944, the only {{aircraft}} with the low-altitude speed {{to be effective}} against it was the Hawker Tempest. Fewer than 30 Tempests were available. They were assigned to No. 150 Wing RAF. Early attempts to intercept and destroy V-1s often failed, but improved techniques soon emerged. These included using the airflow over an interceptor's wing to raise one wing of the V-1, by sliding the wingtip to within 6 in of the lower surface of the V-1's wing. If properly executed, this manoeuvre would tip the V-1's wing up, overriding the gyro and sending the V-1 into an out-of-control dive. At least sixteen V-1s were destroyed this way (the first by a P-51 piloted by Major R. E. Turner of 356th Fighter Squadron on 18 June). It could be seen that the aerodynamic flip method was actually effective when V-1s could be seen over southern parts of the Netherlands headed due eastwards at low altitude, the engine quenched.

The activation kinetics for all samples examined are consistent with rapid (NH 4) 2 SO 4 calibration aerosol. This is consistent with our current understanding of droplet kinetics for ambient CCN.

40|$|Temperature {{and water}} vapor {{variations}} due to {{clouds in the}} TTL have been investigated using co-located MLS, CALISPO, and CloudSat data. Convective cooling occurs only up to cloud top heights, but there is warming above these heights in the TTL. Water vapor and ozone anomalies above cloud top heights support that the warming anomalies occur due to downward motion. Thicker clouds cause a greater magnitude of the temperature anomalies. Water vapor of the environment <b>below</b> <b>cloud</b> tops can either increase or decrease, depending on the cloud top height. The critical factor, which divides these different water vapor variations <b>below</b> <b>cloud</b> tops, is the relative humidity. Clouds hydrate the environment below 16 km, where the air after mixing between cloud and the environmental air does not reach saturation, but clouds dehydrate above 16 km, due to the supersaturation because of the larger temperature drop and the high initial relative humidity.

40|$|Climate {{change and}} human {{influences}} are widely investigated. However, {{the processes of}} aerosol-cloud interactions are still not adequately known and the associated lack of knowledge causes uncertainties in climate change prediction. Therefore this study presents different approaches to investigate those interactions, in particular the Twomey-effect, which states that an increase in aerosol loading leads {{to an increase in}} cloud drop number density and a decrease in cloud drop effective radius, considering constant liquid water path. The data analysed was obtained during the ASCII campaign 2016 at Ascension Island. Cloud and aerosol measurements were done by an ultra-violet (UV) lidar during the month September 2016. The cloud microphysical properties - cloud drop number density and cloud drop effective radius - were retrieved using the cloud property inversion retrieval algorithm. The cloud effective radius varied between 1. 88 and 4. 48 μ m. The cloud drop number density had values in the range of 228 - 1690 cm^- 3. Furthermore, the total aerosol profiles for clear sky scenes and the aerosol profiles <b>below</b> <b>clouds</b> were retrieved, solving the boundary-value-problem using the ’Klett’ approach. For the aerosol profiles <b>below</b> <b>clouds</b> an extra factor was introduced, accounting for multiple scattering inside the clouds. The aerosol loading arrived at Ascension Island came mainly from the South (Atlantic Ocean) in the lower 1200 m or from the East (African continent, biomass burning events) above 1200 m. The aerosol-cloud interactions were examined for both the clear sky and the below cloud aerosols with the cloud properties. Both approaches gave evidence for the Twomey-effect. Those results suggest that the UV-lidar is a suitable instrument for investigation of aerosol-cloud interactions. Future projects can use those approaches to gain more knowledge over the interactions, enabling a major improvement of climate change predictions. Ascension Island Initiative 2016 (ASCII...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{organization}} of convection is ubiquitous, but its physical understanding remains limited. One {{particular type of}} organization is the spatial self-aggregation of convection, taking the form of cloud clusters, or tropical cyclones {{in the presence of}} rotation. We show that several physical processes can give rise to self-aggregation and highlight the key features responsible for it, using idealized simulations. Longwave radiative feedbacks yield a radiative aggregation. In that case, sufficient spatial variability of radiative cooling rates yields a low-level circulation, which induces the upgradient energy transport and radiative-convective instability. Not only do vertically integrated radiative budgets matter but the vertical profile of cooling is also crucial. Convective aggregation is facilitated when downdrafts <b>below</b> <b>clouds</b> are weak (moisture-memory aggregation), and this is sufficient to trigger aggregation in the absence of longwave radiative feedbacks. These results shed some light on the sensitivity of self-aggregation to various parameters, including resolution or domain size...|$|E
5000|$|Cloud suck is {{typically}} associated {{with an increase in}} thermal updraft velocity near cloud base. As a parcel of air lifted in a thermal rises, it also cools, and water vapour will eventually condense to form a cloud if the parcel rises above the lifted condensation level. As the water vapour condenses, it releases its latent heat of vaporization, thereby increasing the buoyancy of the parcel.The updraft is amplified by this latent heat release. Although the process that causes this amplification happens above cloud base height, the effect is often noticeable as much as 300 m (1,000 feet) <b>below</b> <b>cloud</b> base. In fact, it is this effect <b>below</b> <b>cloud</b> base, not the effect within the cloud, that is generally referred to by pilots as cloud suck.

40|$|Aerosol {{vertical}} profile significantly affects the aerosol direct radiative forcing at the TOA level. The {{degree to which}} the aerosol profile impacts the aerosol forcing depends on many factors such as presence of cloud, surface albedo and aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA). Using a radiation model, we show that for absorbing aerosols (with an SSA of 0. 7 – 0. 8) whether aerosols are located above <b>cloud</b> or <b>below</b> induces at least one order of magnitude larger changes of the aerosol forcing than how aerosols are vertically distributed in clear skies, above <b>cloud</b> or <b>below</b> <b>cloud.</b> To see if this finding also holds for the global average aerosol direct radiative effect, we use realistic AOD distribution by integrating MODIS, MISR and AERONET observations, SSA from AERONET and cloud data from various satellite observations. It is found that whether aerosols are above <b>cloud</b> or <b>below</b> controls about 70 – 80 % of the effect of aerosol {{vertical profile}} on the global aerosol radiative effect.

40|$|The {{influence}} of shadow {{from a broken}} cloud layer at top of a convective boundary layer (CBL) on the turbulent flow structure in the layer is investigated. The study addresses fair weather shallow convection over dry land surfaces as exemplified by a high-resolution satellite observation. A three-dimensional Monte-Carlo radiative transfer calculation reveals the strong reduction of net solar flux {{in the shadow of}} such clouds with some enhancement between the clouds. The turbulent convection is studied using a simple conceptional model and a large eddy simulation. The models assume total shadow <b>below</b> <b>clouds,</b> instantaneous response of the vertical heat flux to shadow, and the kinematic association of clouds with updrafts in the upper CBL. The study shows that the convective motion is necessarily nonsteady in case of vertical shadow.
