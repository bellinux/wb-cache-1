40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to gain a greater {{understanding}} of the interactions between the <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> and coating color in the metered size press (MSP) nip. The effect of <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> in precoating with an MSP was investigated using mill woodfree base papers, laboratory sheets, pilot base papers and non-porous materials. The coating color formulations consisted of commercial raw materials, in most cases latex-CMC colors with a pigment mixture of CaCO 3 and kaolin. Coating studies were carried out at 1000 m / min with a pilot-scale MSP coater. The coating layer formation on woodfree <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> in MSP precoating depended mainly on the <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> surface openness. Lowering the <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> openness by raising the filler content, adding mechanical pulp or through more intensive refining of the chemical pulps resulted in lower coatweights, but better coating coverage. <b>Base</b> <b>paper</b> roughness, small-scale basis weight variation (beta formation) and surface chemical properties of the fibers (hydrophilic / hydrophobic) had no effect on precoating layer formation or coverage. Coating color liquid phase seemed to penetrate mainly into the voids between the fibers, because of the short contact time in the film transfer nip. SEM-BSE and LIPS coverage measuring methods were found to give similar results for the precoated surfaces. The LIPS coverage results were lower than the SEM-BSE results at low coatweights. This indicated that the SEM-BSE method found thinner coating layers to be covered. Low <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> surface openness and high filler content {{on the surface of the}} sheet reduced coating color penetration into the <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> structure and the coating color stayed on the surface better. Dense base papers with high filler contents gave better small-scale uniformity than porous base papers. The coating coverage was sensitive to <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> shadow marking, which was clearly seen as large-scale coverage non-uniformity. With base papers with less filler on the surface, coverage could still be increased by increasing coating color viscosity. Using higher levels of kaolin in the coating formula improved coverage, especially at low coatweights. The machine speed and nip load did not affect coating coverage. The color solids content had only a minor impact on coating coverage. Smaller differences in coverage two-sidedness were observed when both paper sides were coated simultaneously compared to the situation where only one side was coated. When the paper was coated using hard rolls, coating coverage depended largely on the pore size of the <b>base</b> <b>paper.</b> Coatweight was formed mainly through penetration, the result being a dense coating layer. With soft rolls coating layer formation occurred more by dewatering, in which case better coverage was obtained, albeit accompanied by a porous coating layer. The porous coating layer with good coverage was the result of filter cake formation in the film transfer nip. The main mechanism by which coating layer formation took place was pressure-induced penetration of bulk coating color or liquid phase into the voids between fibers in the transfer nip. Water sorption into the fibers was slower than capillary penetration, and the movement of coating color liquid phase by diffusion and possibly by capillary absorption took place mainly after the nip. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Drying occurs {{twice during}} coated paper production: first, when drying the <b>base</b> <b>paper,</b> then when drying the sheet freshly coated with an aqueous {{suspension}} of pigment particles. The effects on coated paper quality from the impingement drying conditions used at both <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> and coated paper drying stages were studied {{for the light}} weight coated (LWC) paper. A central feature {{of the study was}} the development of the capability to dry coated paper by impingement in superheated steam. The variables investigated were the drying fluid, air or superheated steam, drying fluid temperature, drying time and temperature, and coating-to-drying delay time. The effects of drying on the uncoated paper physical properties and the coated paper physical and printing properties were determined. The drying of the <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> with superheated steam gave higher strength and hydrophobicity but lower optical properties and smoothness than drying in air. When steam-dried <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> was coated and dried in air or steam it gave a rougher, less glossy, less bright coated paper than air-dried <b>base</b> <b>paper.</b> Print mottle remained high when air drying was used subsequently for the coated sheet. The biggest effect on LWC coated paper quality derived from the choice of drying medium, air or superheated steam. Coating-to-drying delay time had no effect. Most of the properties of steam-dried coated paper were fixed by 0. 6 s drying time. Properties the most affected were surface properties: print quality, gloss and roughness, while bulk properties were less sensitive. Drying with superheated steam gave lower gloss and smoothness than drying in air. Print mottle was significantly improved with steam drying of the coated sheet. Superheated steam drying of coated paper has advantages only if used for the coated sheet not the base sheet...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to explore the connection of paper machine wet end process variables to output quality and to specify the levels at which the variables produce the best achievable quality characteristics in multicriteria environment. While existing control methods are mainly based on staff experience, a model providing better predictability and controllability of the process would be of considerable value. The quality criteria in scrutiny are web breaks, variation in <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> grammage, machine calander moisture, machine calander ash content, steam to the machine and <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> holes. The causal relationship is studied using Robust Portfolio Modelling and Bayesian variable selection along with appropriate statistical tests. The methodology allows for making analysis amid uncertainty on both criterion preferences and model selection. Underlying latent factors are identified using Factor analysis and Independent component analysis. Consequently, a methodology for controlling the wet end performance is proposed. The data is adjusted with appropriate time variant process lags calculated from on-line measurement data.
