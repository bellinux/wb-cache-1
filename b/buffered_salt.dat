40|$|The {{administration}} of fluid resuscitation to critically ill patients {{is a common}} intervention. High quality research evidence suggests that fluid type can impact on important patient outcomes. When new knowledge is generated {{the next step is}} translating this evidence into practice to ensure patients receive the best available treatments. The aim of this thesis was to use mixed methods to describe national and international trends of fluid resuscitation use in relation to key published research between 2007 and 2013 to determine if knowledge translation had occurred and secondly to describe key drivers for clinicians’ choice of fluid resuscitation. The main findings are: 1) In a series of point prevalence studies tracking fluid resuscitation practices in Australia and New Zealand over a 6 -year period: a. Fluid resuscitation practices changed between 2007 and 2013 b. The use of 0. 9 % sodium chloride remained unchanged, but the use of <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> solutions increased c. There was a decreased use of semi-synthetic colloids, specifically gelatin 2) In a large international cross-sectional study of fluid resuscitation practices in 2014 : a. Crystalloids were used more often than colloids b. The drivers for this were increasing use of <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> solutions and a decreasing use of the semi-synthetic colloids gelatin and hydroxyethyl starch c. Geographical location was an independent determinant for the type of fluid administered 3) In an analysis of fluid resuscitation practices in the same intensive care units from two international cross-sectional studies: a. Fluid resuscitation practices changed between 2007 and 2014 b.

2500|$|Salts {{freezing}} - Fluoride salt mixtures have melting points {{ranging from}} 300 to 600°C (...) [...] The salts, {{especially those with}} beryllium fluoride, are very viscous near their freezing point. This requires careful design and freeze protection in the containment and heat exchangers. Freezing must be prevented in normal operation, during transients, and during extended downtime. The primary loop salt contains the decay heat-generating fission products, which help to maintain the required temperature. For the MSBR, ORNL planned on keeping the entire reactor room (the hot cell) at high temperature. This avoided the need for individual electric heater lines on all piping and provided more even heating of the primary loop components. One [...] "liquid oven" [...] concept developed for molten salt-cooled, solid-fueled reactors employs a separate <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> pool containing the entire primary loop. Because of the high heat capacity and considerable density of the <b>buffer</b> <b>salt,</b> the <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> prevents fuel salt freezing and participates in the passive decay heat cooling system, provides radiation shielding and reduces deadweight stresses on primary loop components.

One such reaction is the lipase-catalyzed esterification between citronellol and acetic acid, in a medium of hexane. Both reaction conditions and special pretreatments on the lipase impact the lipase's catalytic performance. This project focuses on improving lipase performance by optimizing its pretreatment. The pretreatment factors studied include pH adjustment, lyophilization time, addition of <b>buffer</b> <b>salts,</b> non-buffer salts, denaturants or active site protectants to the lyophilizate, and flash-freezing in the presence of phase interfaces. The effectiveness of a particular pretreatment is presented in terms of 'relative performance' (RP), which is equal to the number of times faster the pretreated lipase catalyzes the reaction relative to untreated lipase. The individual and interactive effects of the pretreatment factors were studied in detail and compared. <b>Buffer</b> <b>salts</b> had a much stronger performance enhancing effect than non-buffer salts; pretreatment with 90 % (w/w) sodium phosphate yielded lipase with an RP of ∼ 64 (catalyzed the reaction ∼ 64 times faster that untreated lipase). A strong interaction between the treatments with sodium phosphate and pH adjustment was found. Both these treatments may mitigate the inhibitory effect of acetic acid, one of the substrates. Activating effects of phase interfaces and active site protectants are shown to be complementary to other treatments, demonstrating that they act by a distinct mechanism. An optimization process known as 'the method of steepest ascent' was used to simultaneously optimize the pH and <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> pretreatments, as well as the concentration of acetic acid in the reaction mixture, This process succeeded in rapidly developing pretreatment combinations that yielded lipase with RP as high as 170.

However, the optimum a(w) was uncertain because the available a(w) range for salt hydrates is < or = 0. 90. Investigation of the remaining water activity range was made possible by using an a(w) depressor (sorbitol) to lower the a(w) of a two-phase system.

Methods: We recorded the administration of resuscitation fluids in patients admitted to Australian and New Zealand adult intensive care units (ICUs) for a 24 -h period at 6 time points between 2007 and 2013. Changes in patterns of fluid use over this period were determined using regression analyses. Results: Of the 2825 patients admitted to the 61 ICUs on the 6 study days, 754 (26. 7 %) patients received fluid resuscitation. Of those receiving fluid resuscitation, the proportion of patients receiving crystalloid significantly increased from 28. 9 % (41 / 142) in 2007 to 50. 5 % (48 / 95) in 2013 (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2. 93; 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 1. 35 – 6. 33; p = 0. 006); of these, the proportion of patients receiving <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> solutions significantly increased from 4. 9 % (7 / 142) in 2007 to 31. 6 % (30 / 95) in 2013 (OR 7. 00; 95 % CI 2. 14 – 22. 92; p = 0. 001).

40|$|The {{characterization}} of mechanisms, analytical benefits, and applications {{of two different}} methods for producing high charge state protein ions in electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS), or "supercharging", are presented in this dissertation. High charge state protein ions are desirable in tandem MS due to their higher fragmentation efficiency and thus greater amount of sequence {{information that can be}} obtained from them. The first supercharging method, supercharging with reagents (typically non-volatile organic molecules), is shown in this work to be able to produce such highly charged protein ions from denaturing solutions that about one in every three residues carries a charge. The high Coulomb repulsion in these ions results in these ions adopting near-linear gas-phase structures with little to no non-covalent interactions, making them ideal for efficient fragmentation in tandem MS experiments and for the minimization of gas phase HD scrambling during tandem MS. Supercharging with reagents from aqueous solutions typically produces much lower charge states as compared to that observed from a denaturing solution. However, two new reagents are presented in this work that increase protein ion charge past that from denaturing solutions when added to aqueous solutions at just 2 % by volume. Increases in charge of up to 168 % are reported in the presence of these reagents. The mechanism of the increases in protein ion charging with these reagents from aqueous solutions was investigated with fluorescence experiments and correlated to a destabilization of the protein structure by these reagents toward denaturation. The actual protein denaturation event likely occurs in the ESI droplet itself, consistent with previous studies of the mechanism of supercharging with reagents. Thus, efficient tandem MS of high charge states is possible from ESI of aqueous solutions in which a protein maintains its native or native-like structure and activity, enabling tandem MS analysis of protein modifications, ligand binding, or structural changes in real time. Interestingly, another application for supercharging reagents is protein desalting in the ESI droplet. Supercharging reagents bind to sodium ions, resulting in less non-specific sodium ion adduction to proteins, which can improve signal-to-noise ratios of protein ions, lower limits of detection, and enable the detection of bound ligands or specific binding of salts that might otherwise be obscured by sodium adduction. The second supercharging method, electrothermal supercharging (ETS), requires the presence of particular <b>buffer</b> <b>salts</b> rather than organic reagents to increase protein ion charge in the ESI droplet. An investigation of the effect of several different <b>buffer</b> <b>salts</b> on ETS is presented in this work, revealing that the choice of <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> is very important to obtaining effective ETS and that <b>buffer</b> <b>salts</b> likely stabilize or destabilize protein structure in the ESI droplet via Hofmeister effects. The application of ETS to tandem MS of proteins produced by ESI and its utility on proteins ranging in size over an order of magnitude (8. 6 kDa to 83. 0 kDa) is demonstrated. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments can be performed in aqueous solutions and measured continuously with ETS coupled to tandem MS for protein structure analysis in real time with a spatial resolution of 1. 3 residues and without gas phase hydrogen-deuterium scrambling. This work demonstrates the wide applicability of ETS for the study of primary and higher order protein structure for small and large proteins alike...|$|R

When studying amprenavir transport across Caco- 2 monolayers, the absorptive permeability coefficient (Papp) increased from 12. 8 ± 0. 4 · 10 - 6 cm/s for the control condition to 20 ± 2 · 10 - 6 cm/s when using FaSSIF or blank HIF as apical medium. Including verapamil in either of these conditions further increased transport, illustrating that amprenavir is a substrate of P-glycoprotein related efflux carriers. When using HIF aspirated after intake of the amprenavir formulation, a wide range in Papp values (8 · 10 - 6 - 25 · 10 - 6 cm/s) was obtained; inclusion of verapamil did not increase amprenavir transport. Compared to the control condition, these fluids contained bile salts, phospholipids and the solubilizing excipient TPGS, responsible for amprenavir concentrations up to 5 mM. TPGS {{has been shown to}} inhibit P-glycoprotein, explaining the absence of an additional effect of verapamil. P-glycoprotein appears not to be functionally active in the presence of HIF aspirated after intake of an amprenavir formulation. This illustrates that differences between standard apical conditions and conditions representative for the in vivo luminal environment may affect the outcome of drug transport studies. A better understanding of intraluminal conditions after oral drug intake may improve the biorelevance of in vitro permeability estimation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether chronic glucocorticoid excess influences the metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (PGs) in the renal cortex, the authors investigated {{the effects of}} dexa-methasone treatment (2. 5 mg/kg/week) on the metabolism of arachidonic acid by renal cortex homogenates and microsomes and by isolated glomeruli, and on the release of immunoreactive prostanoids from isolated glomeruli incubated for 30 mm in <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> solution at 37 #{ 176 }C. Glomeruli from dexamethasone-treated rats released, during basal incubation conditions, about twice (P <. 01) as much PGE 2 and PGF 2,, as did glomeruli from vehicle-treated rats. During incubation with arachidonic acid (33 M) or calcium ionophore, A 231 87 (2. 0 g/ml), the release of PGE 2 and PGF 2,, from glomeruli of rats receiving dexamethasone also exceeded (P <. 01) the release from glomeruli of control rats.

40|$|The {{extraction}} of lysozyme, alpha-chymotrypsin, and pepsin from <b>buffered</b> <b>salt</b> solutions into reverse micelles was examined at different pH values and surfactant concentrations. The reverse micelles were formed by mixing aqueous buffer supplemented with KCl and an organic phase of isooctane(2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane), containing the anionic surfactant, Aerosol O. T. (dioctyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid). The technique of dynamic laser scattering {{was used to}} measure the size of reverse micelles which were in equilibrium with the aqueous phase. It was found that the size of the reverse micelles decreased with increasing ionic strength but increased with increasing AOT concentration. In the process of extraction the reverse micelles might have rearranged themselves to host the protein. The sizes of protein-filled and -unfilled reverse micelles were different and an open equilibrium could be reached between them. Under the extraction conditions, {{only a small number of}} micelles were found to contain protein...|$|E
40|$|Rat {{somatotropin}} (growth hormone) was labelled biosynthetically by incubating anterior pituitary lobes with radioactive {{amino acids}} for 24 h {{in a simple}} <b>buffered</b> <b>salts</b> medium containing glucose. The labelled hormone was isolated by preparative polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis or by chromatography on Sephadex G- 100 and then DEAE-cellulose. The labelled material was pure by several criteria and cross-reacted immunologically with unlabelled rat somatotropin. When a mixture of 14 C-labelled amino acids was used for labelling the protein, label could be introduced into these same amino acids of somatotropin, though relative specific radioactivities varied considerably. Somatotropin labelled by the procedures {{described in the present}} paper was suitable for structural studies and could be used for a variety of other biochemical experiments...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{retention}} mechanism in HILIC was investigated {{based on the}} chromatographic behaviour of the water-soluble vitamins. For this purpose, diol-silica, bare silica and amino-silica were utilized, as stationary phases. The chromatographic parameters evaluated for each stationary phase were the eluent strength, the mobile phase pH, the presence of different <b>buffer</b> <b>salts,</b> the <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> concentration, {{the nature of the}} organic solvent and the column temperature. For detailed investigation of the retention mechanism, two models of partitioning and surface adsorption and a third model, which considers the solute-solvent-stationary phase interactions were examined for the degree-of-fitness on retention data. Moreover, a method was developed and validated for the analysis of water-soluble vitamins in a pharmaceutical preparation and a vitamin fortified drink. Based on the results derived from the fitness of the model equations on retention, and the thermodynamic data, it is confirmed that the retention mechanism in HILIC is a mixed mode with partitioning and surface adsorption operating synergistically. The amplitude of the water content at which surface adsorption becomes apparent is depended on the water layer thickness and the charge of the stationary phase, the charge of the analytes and the presence of <b>buffer</b> <b>salt</b> ions. For the neutral vitamins, the adsorption mechanism becomes apparent at ACN content ? 80 % for the diol-silica column and at ACN content ? 75 % for the bare silica and amino-silica columns. For analytes carrying the same charge with the stationary phase, the switching from partition to surface adsorption mechanism becomes evident at ACN content ? 85 %, where electrostatic repulsion is weakened due to the preferable distribution of the salt ions into the aqueous layer. Finally, the surface adsorption mechanism is predominant for compounds being electrostatically attracted by the stationary phase. The investigation on the effect of different organic solvents on the retention behavior of water-soluble vitamins brings forward the conclusive evidence that hydrogen bonds contribute greatly to the retention mechanism. Following the criteria of resolution, peak symmetry, isocratic eluting conditions and the total analysis time, the diol-column was chosen for the quantitative determination of the water-soluble vitamins. The chromatographic conditions were as follows: ACN/H 2 O 90 / 10 (v/v), CH 3 COONH 4 10 mM, TEA 20 mM, pH 5, 0. In addition, the column temperature was set at 25 oC and the mobile phase flow rate at the value of 0, 8 mL/min. The suitability of the chromatographic conditions was established according to the system suitability test. Validation was verified by method detection and quantitation limits, accuracy, inter- and intra-day precisions and vitamin recoveries from samples. ...|$|R
30|$|In our buffer-based {{synthesis}} systems, these buffers displayed significant affinity to {{a number}} of metal ions, resulting in the formation of metal complexes. However, these buffer complexes are not stable and are readily oxidized by Au(III). This oxidation is accompanied by the simultaneous reduction of Au(III) to Au(II)/Au(I), and finally to Au(0), which results in the formation of Au NPs. NP formation can be completed within a few seconds to a few hours, depending on the buffer chemical, and the formed particles are stable for periods ranging from a few days to several months. BTM, containing five hydroxyl groups, was found to induce the spontaneous, instant formation of Au NPs at room temperature. The second fastest Au NP formations occurred when using the TEA and PIPES buffers. The three hydroxyl groups in TEA and the –SO 3 H groups and piperazine rings in PIPES and PIPES-SS were able to reduce Au(III) to Au(0) within a few minutes at room temperature. Note that this short reaction time may induce less size and shape homogeneity in the formed NPs, as it provides insufficient time to allow for Ostwald ripening. The other buffers contain either electron-donating groups or fewer electron-withdrawing groups, which result in slower oxidation reactions; these require heating at 100  °C to accelerate the formation of Au NPs. Unreacted <b>buffer</b> <b>salts</b> may introduce additional confusion to the research in this field.
