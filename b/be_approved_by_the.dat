All matches would take place on the home ice of the champions, although specific dates and times would have to <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> trustees.|$|E
5|$|As was customary, {{the treaty}} {{would have to}} <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> nobles and knights of both lands. The meeting between the nobility of Pomerelia and Greater Poland took place between 13–15 September 1284 {{in the town of}} Nakło, where they {{confirmed}} the rights of Przemysł II over Gdańsk Pomerania. The unification of Pomerelia and Greater Poland was not the only decision made by Przemysł II and Mestwin II. The favors shown by the Duke of Pomerelia to the powerful witnesses of the agreement from Greater Poland showed that they were also keenly interested in the close integration of the two lands.|$|E

5|$|At the {{southern}} end of the Western Wall, Robinson's Arch along with a row of vaults once supported stairs ascending from the street to the Temple Mount. Because it does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the site has been opened to religious groups that hold worship services that would not <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Rabbi or the Ministry in the major men's and women's prayer areas against the Wall.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey quarrelled with Richard in 1196 in Normandy {{while the}} {{archbishop}} {{was attempting to}} return to England. Richard forbade him from administering York, and Geoffrey returned to Rome until 1198. An attempt at reconciliation with Richard came to nothing, after Geoffrey refused to approve the king's appointments in the diocese of York without some guarantees that they would <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> papacy. Ultimately Pope Innocent III on 28April 1199 ordered that Geoffrey was to be restored to his lands {{as soon as he}} had paid his debts to the king. Innocent further ordered that any royal appointments in York would require papal approval.|$|E

On March 3, 1893, Congress duly passed an act authorising the souvenir coin, which was to be to the specifications of the quarter struck for circulation, and with a design to <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Secretary of the Treasury. Total mintage of the special quarter would be limited to 40,000 specimens.|$|E

5|$|On 20 August 1934, civil {{servants}} {{were required to}} swear an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler; a similar oath had been required of members of the military several weeks prior. This law became the basis of the Führerprinzip, the concept that Hitler's word overrode all existing laws. Any acts that were sanctioned by Hitler—even murder—thus became legal. All legislation proposed by cabinet ministers had to <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> office of Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess, who also had a veto over top civil service appointments.|$|E

The 30-minute shutdown was criticized by the media and King County Executive Dow Constantine as an attempt to hamper protesters' freedom of speech and right to free assembly. Service was resumed at the direction of Sound Transit CEO Peter Rogoff, and the following week Sound Transit and King County Metro formalized a new protocol requiring future requests from law enforcement to suspend service <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> CEO or general manager.|$|E

In November 2008, for the first time, the Smithsonian opened a board meeting to the public. Clough has made {{efforts to improve the}} Smithsonian's facilities and long-term planning, as well as plans to reorganize and cut back on staff and budget. In February 2012, Clough's travel expenses were probed by senator Charles E.

5|$|The Reichskulturkammer (Reich Chamber of Culture) was {{organised}} {{under the}} control of the Propaganda Ministry in September 1933. Sub-chambers were set up to control aspects of cultural life such as film, radio, newspapers, fine arts, music, theatre and literature. Members of these professions were required to join their respective organisation. Jews and people considered politically unreliable were prevented from working in the arts and many emigrated. Books and scripts had to <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Propaganda Ministry prior to publication. Standards deteriorated as the regime sought to use cultural outlets exclusively as propaganda media.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} ended soon after, in {{an effective}} stalemate and a formal compromise: a Parthian prince of the Arsacid line would henceforth {{sit on the}} Armenian throne, but his nomination had to <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Roman emperor. This conflict was the first direct confrontation between Parthia and the Romans since Crassus' disastrous expedition and Mark Antony's campaigns a century earlier, and {{would be the first}} of a long series of wars between Rome and Iranian powers over Armenia (see Roman–Persian Wars).|$|E

Denise Hibbard, who had been an assistant principal at California High School for six years, was chosen as Dougherty's first principal.|$|E
5|$|The state {{constitution}} had come under considerable criticism {{beginning in the}} 1840s because it allowed most government positions to be filled by appointment. The problem with this method of filling positions did not manifest itself until {{the advent of the}} state's political parties. Once in power, a party could stack the government with its own members, making it difficult for the minority to regain power. Another problem was that the authority for many trivial issues were not delegated to other authorities. For example, if a man was to divorce his wife, the divorce bill had to <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly before he or she could legally remarry.|$|E
5|$|White Zombie premiered on July 28, 1932, in New York City's Rivoli Theatre. The film {{received}} a mixed box office reception upon its initial release, {{but was a}} great financial success for an independent film at the time. In 1933 and 1934, the film experienced positive box-office numbers in small towns in the United States, {{as well as in}} Germany under the title Flucht von der Teufelsinsel. White Zombie {{was one of the few}} American horror films to <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Nazis.

5|$|Without any {{ostensible}} heir, Cosimo contemplated {{restoring the}} Republic of Florence. However, this presented many obstacles. Florence was nominally an Imperial fief, and Siena a Spanish one. The plan {{was about to}} <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> powers convened at Geertruidenberg when Cosimo abruptly added that if himself and his two sons predeaceased the Electress Palatine she should succeed and the republic be re-instituted following her death.

5|$|City {{officials}} announced on August 6 that Mayor de Blasio would {{push for a}} tax on wealthy New York City residents {{to help pay for}} necessary improvements in the subway. The proposal would tax New York City residents that make more than $500,000 and for married couples with incomes above $1 million. The proposal would raise between $700 million to $800 million, with $250 of it going for half-priced MetroCards for 800,000 riders at or below the poverty line, a shift from de Blasio's previous stance. To go into effect, it would have to <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> New York State Legislature. This proposal was criticized by Governor Cuomo and MTA Chairman Joe Lhota for not providing money soon enough, the State Legislature does not go back into session until January 2018.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{approved}} {{the extension of}} I-70; however, the route still had to <b>be</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> representatives of the U.S. military on the planning committee. Military representatives were concerned that plans for this new highway network {{did not have a}} direct connection from the central U.S. to southern California; and further felt Salt Lake City was adequately connected. Military planners {{approved the}} extension, but moved the western terminus south to Cove Fort, using I-70 as part of a link between Denver with Los Angeles instead of Salt Lake City. Utah officials objected to the modification, complaining they were being asked to build a long and expensive freeway that would serve no populated areas of the state. After being told this was the only way the military would approve the extension, Utah officials agreed to build the freeway along the approved route.|$|E
