5|$|Analyses {{has been}} {{published}} <b>by</b> <b>currency</b> strategists at RBS, scoring countries on their potential to undertake intervention, measuring their relative intention to weaken their currency and their capacity to do so. Ratings {{are based on the}} openness of a country's economy, export growth and real effective exchange rate (REER) valuation, as well as the scope a country has to weaken its currency without damaging its economy. As of January 2013, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile and Sweden are the most willing and able to intervene, while the UK and New Zealand are among the least.|$|E
5|$|Iceland, {{not part}} of the EU, is {{regarded}} as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It defaulted on its debt and drastically devalued its currency, which has effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive. Lee Harris argues that floating exchange rates allows wage reductions <b>by</b> <b>currency</b> devaluations, a politically easier option than the economically equivalent but politically impossible method of lowering wages by political enactment. Sweden's floating rate currency gives it a short-term advantage, structural reforms and constraints account for longer-term prosperity. Labour concessions, a minimal reliance on public debt, and tax reform helped to further a pro-growth policy.|$|E

25|$|The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, {{which started}} in Thailand, was a major blow to the Ramos administration. The economy was hit <b>by</b> <b>currency</b> devaluation. The same was true for the Thai baht, Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah. Growth fell to about −0.6% in 1998 from 5.2% in 1997, but {{recovered}} to 3.4% by 1999. It also resulted to the shutdown of some businesses, a decline in importation, a rising unemployment rate and an unstable financial sector.|$|E
50|$|Under {{a system}} of fixed {{exchange}} rates maintained <b>by</b> a <b>currency</b> board every unit of local currency must be backed by a unit of foreign currency (correcting for the exchange rate).

25|$|It was the Manx Government's {{position}} that, if the United Kingdom {{had decided}} {{to participate in the}} euro, then it would be likely that the Island would also choose to participate. Primarily this was because most of the Island's trade is with the United Kingdom and other countries of Europe, and the break-up of the existing currency union with the UK would cause economic harm to the Island. There was also concern that the island's economy is not large enough to withstand attack <b>by</b> <b>currency</b> speculators if the Manx pound became a stand-alone free-floating currency.|$|E

25|$|A {{currency}} transaction tax {{is a tax}} {{placed on}} {{a specific type of}} currency transaction for a specific purpose. This term has been most commonly associated with the financial sector, as opposed to consumption taxes paid by consumers. The most frequently discussed versions of a currency transaction tax are the Tobin tax, Edgar L. Feige's Automated Payment Transaction tax and Spahn tax. The Automated Payment Transaction tax requires that all transactions be taxed regardless of the means of payment. As such, it proposes a unique tax on currency transactions collected at the time currency leaves or enters the banking system. Since each transaction mediated <b>by</b> <b>currency</b> can not be directly taxed, the APT tax proposes a brokerage fee on currency deposits and withdrawals that is some multiple of the flat transaction tax rate applied to all payments made via electronic payments mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} environment for VP Bank {{in the period}} between 1970 and 1979 was marked <b>by</b> <b>currency,</b> stock market and banking crises. Historically high inflation rates, a devaluation of the Swiss franc in 1971, the plummeting US dollar exchange rate, collapsing stock prices, scandals surrounding Cologne’s Herstatt-Bank in 1974 and Switzerland’s SKA in 1977, along with a recession in Liechtenstein that started in 1975 – {{the first in the}} post-WWII era for the Principality – all combined to make the 1970s indeed a turbulent decade. To defend against excessive capital inflows from abroad, the Swiss government in June 1972 prohibited the payment of interest on foreign CHF-denominated deposits and imposed a commission on them (negative interest rates of up to ten per cent quarterly, i.e. 40 per cent per year). Liechtenstein was declared a foreign country with regard to currency; however, upon Liechtenstein’s adoption of the relevant Swiss provisions, the Federal Council once again granted the Principality domestic status for currency and foreign exchange purposes as of 1 August 1973. VP Bank increased its share capital twice by 15 million Swiss francs in 1974 and 1979. And finally, the bank was granted in 1975 a full concession to offer the entire range of banking products, including savings accounts and mortgages. During this consolidation phase, its total assets increased from 150 to 530 million Swiss francs and the workforce more than doubled from 41 to 86.|$|E

However a 2001 production in Sydney was panned by the reviewer, who described it as [...] "formulaic and obvious, complete with clunky and unconvincing pat ending", and thought the play should be [...] "put out to pasture".
