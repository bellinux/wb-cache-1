5000|$|Busbars are {{produced}} {{in a variety}} of shapes such as flat strips, solid <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods</b> typically copper, brass or aluminium in solid or hollow tubes. Some of these shapes allow heat to dissipate more efficiently due to their high surface area to cross-sectional area ratio. The skin effect makes 50-60 Hz AC busbars more than about 8 mm thickness inefficient, so hollow or flat shapes are prevalent in higher current applications. A hollow section also has higher stiffness than a solid rod of equivalent current-carrying capacity, which allows a greater span between busbar supports in outdoor electrical switchyards.|$|E

50|$|Lisco {{is among}} the largest {{companies}} in Libya, having an annual production capacity of approximately 1,324,000 tons of liquid steel. Lisco’s operations are primarily supplied by imported iron ore pellets from Brazil, Canada, and Sweden for use as raw materials. Natural gas is used to manufacture sponge iron and hot briquetted iron. Hot-briquetted iron (HBI) became a significant Libyan mineral export since the LISCO II plant began producing it in 1997. About 54% of Lisco’s exports (by weight) in 2000 was HBI. <b>Bars</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods</b> shipped to Egypt and Tunisia accounted for about 23% of the company’s exports. Lisco has its own captive port with specialized facilities, such as a telescopic ship-loading conveyor for loading HBI into ships.

40|$|Recent {{reorganization}} of the US {{iron and steel industry}} provides a useful setting for an analysis of the relationship between industrial location and institutional forms. Regression analysis shows that institutional shifts in the organization of production dominated geographical shifts in employment and product value as integrated maxi-mills sought to raise productivity. The {{reorganization of}} production includes mill abandonment, increased subcontracting by maxi-mills in the initial stages of production, horizontal penetration by mini-mills in the sheet-steel market, and the growing integration of steel finishing and automobile assembly as firms that belong to Japanese corporate groups expand their operations in the USA. Maxi-mills are concentrating investment and production in the Midwest states as their joint ventures with Japanese steel firms specialize in the mass production of galvanized sheets for the automobile industry. Locational shifts also include the national spread of scrap-processing mini-mills and the rapid decline of raw-steel production in Pittsburgh as maxi-mills close furnaces and mills producing construction-grade <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The finds and {{features}} of several archaeological periods were uncovered in 2009 during the salvage excavations preceding {{the construction of}} the Hévíz bypass of Road 76. Of these, roughly 110 features forming five distinct clusters were part of a Middle Iron Age open settlement. The two moulds made from local sandstone were used for casting bronze buttons or loop buttons and small bow brooches. One of the two bivalve moulds was strongly worn, while the other was semi-finished. The bronze workshop located {{in the middle of the}} settlement was made up of two buildings and their immediate vicinity. The bronze <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods</b> were raw materials awaiting processing. The richly diverse material can be dated to the later 6 th century BC (Ha D 2) : one portion is typical for the period’s assemblages from Transdanubia, another can be linked to the Scythians, while a few artefacts reflect contact with the south-eastern Alpine region.

40|$|Over {{the past}} years {{increased}} numbers of studies about {{the implementation of}} adhesive bonding in timber engineering were published. Current practice is to use two-component (2 K) epoxies and polyurethanes in conjunction with threaded steel bars, reinforced concrete <b>bars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods</b> made of fibre reinforces polymer. All these material might be considered questionable in terms of sustainable ecology. The current paper investigates the possible substitution of afore mentioned metallic bars by hardwood dowels, and the polymer based adhesives by glutine and casein based ones. It summarises experimental investigations carried out with different geometric parameters, in which beech (a hardwood) rods were glued into spruce (a softwood) blocks. Joint capacities achieved using glutine and casein based adhesives were compared with results using 2 K epoxies and 2 K polyurethane adhesives under dry conditions, and {{under the influence of}} moisture. Results indicate that current glutine and casein adhesives, if used under dry conditions, achieve similar strength; however, that the influence of moisture is still a limiting factor that severely restricts their usage under adverse conditions. The presentation of the results is completed by a numerical modelling of the considered joints, including a methodology to predict their capacity with a reasonable degree of accuracy...|$|E
40|$|OG Technologies, Inc. (OGT) has led this SQA (Surface Quality Assured Steel Bar) {{program to}} solve the major surface quality {{problems}} plaguing the US special quality steel <b>bars</b> <b>and</b> <b>rods</b> industry and their customers, based on crosscutting sensors and controls technologies. Surface defects in steel formed in a hot rolling process {{are one of the}} most common quality issues faced by the American steel industry, accounting for roughly 50 % of the rejects or 2. 5 % of the total shipment. Unlike other problems such as the mechanical properties of the steel product, most surface defects are sporadic and cannot be addressed based on sampling techniques. This issue hurts the rolling industry and their customers in their process efficiency and operational costs. The goal of this program is to develop and demonstrate an SQA prototype, with synergy of HotEye® and other innovations, that enables effective rolling process control and efficient quality control. HotEye®, OGT’s invention, delivers high definition images of workpieces at or exceeding 1, 450 C while the workpieces travel at 100 m/s. The elimination of surface defect rejects will be achieved through the integration of imaging-based quality assessment, advanced signal processing, predictive process controls and the integration with other quality control tools. The SQA program team, composed of entities capable of and experienced in (1) research, (2) technology manufacturing, (3) technology sales and marketing, and (4) technology end users, is very strong. There were 5 core participants: OGT, Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT), University of Wisconsin (UW), Charter Steel (Charter) and ArcelorMittal Indiana Harbor (Inland). OGT served as the project coordinator. OGT participated in both research and commercialization. GIT and UW provided significant technical inputs to this SQA project. The steel mills provided access to their rolling lines for data collection, design of experiments, host of technology test and verification, and first-hand knowledge of the most advanced rolling line operation in the US. This project lasted 5 years with 5 major tasks. The team successfully worked through the tasks with deliverables in detection, data analysis and process control. Technologies developed in this project were commercialized as soon as they were ready. For instance, the advanced surface defect detection algorithms were integrated into OGT’s HotEye® RSB systems late 2005, resulting in a more matured product serving the steel industry. In addition to the commercialization results, the SQA team delivered 7 papers and 1 patent. OGT was also recognized by two prestigious awards, including the R&D 100 Award in 2006. To date, this SQA project has started to make an impact in the special bar quality industry. The resulted product, HotEye® RSB systems have been accepted by quality steel mills worldwide. Over 16 installations were completed, including 1 in Argentina, 2 in Canada, 2 in China, 2 in Germany, 2 in Japan, and 7 in the U. S. Documented savings in reduced internal rejects, improved customer satisfaction and simplified processes were reported from various mills. In one case, the mill reported over 50 % reduction in its scrap, reflecting a significant saving in energy and reduction in emission. There exist additional applications in the steel industry where the developed technologies can be used. OGT is working toward bringing the developed technologies to more applications. Examples are: in-line inspection and process control for continuous casting, steel rails, and seamless tube manufacturing...|$|E

Standard measurement, data interpretation and data reporting methods were developed and defined by the cross-industry QMST Consortium members consisting of steel-manufacturers, forgers, heat-treaters, modelers, automotive and heavy vehicle OEMs along with team expert technologists from the National Labs and academia. The team designed phase transformation experiments on two selected steel grades to validate the standard practices [...] a medium carbon grade SAE 1050 and an alloy steel SAE 8620.
