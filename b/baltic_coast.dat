5|$|A few {{historians have}} {{hypothesized}} that the Kylfings were a West Slavic people related to the Pomeranians. Under this interpretation, the Slavic term Kolbiag may share common origins with such place-names as Kołobrzeg (formerly Kolberg), a town on the Pomeranian <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast,</b> and Kolpino, a settlement near modern St. Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|Already in May 1656, Alexis of Russia had {{declared}} war on Sweden, taking advantage of Charles being bound in Poland, and Livonia, Estonia and Ingria secured only by a Livonian army of 2,200 infantry and 400 dragoons, Magnus de la Gardie's 7,000 men in Prussia, and 6,933 men dispersed in garrisons along the Eastern <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast.</b> Alexis invaded Livonia in July with 35,000 men and took Dünaburg.|$|E
5|$|Attacks by the Leningrad Front {{had pushed}} Army Group North west of Lake Peipus, {{resulting}} {{in a series of}} operations around Narva. In the south, Soviet forces had advanced towards the <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast</b> at the end of Operation Bagration the Belorussian strategic offensive (June–August 1944) against Army Group Centre. The Soviet Tallinn Offensive was designed {{as a part of the}} Baltic Offensive to eliminate the positions of Army Group North along the Baltic.|$|E

50|$|His {{thesis is}} not {{confirmed}} by convincing archeological proofs: as {{results from the}} excavation, the <b>Baltic</b> <b>coasts</b> were populated by Neolithic cultures, using ceramic crockery and not bronze objects, at the time suggested by Vinci. The Scandinavian Bronze Age, in fact, began later.|$|R
50|$|The Iron Ore Line (not a main line), from Luleå to Narvik in Norway, {{provided}} a highly efficient transportation linkage from the iron ores near Kiruna and Gällivare to harbours {{on both the}} Atlantic and the <b>Baltic</b> <b>coasts.</b> The sections of the Iron Ore Line were completed in stages between 1888 and 1903.|$|R
5|$|Mieszko thus {{strove to}} subdue Pomerania at the <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast.</b> The area {{was the site}} of wealthy trade emporia, {{frequently}} visited by traders, especially from the east, west and north. Mieszko had {{every reason to believe that}} great profits would have resulted from his ability to control the rich seaports situated on long distance trade routes such as Wolin, Szczecin and Kołobrzeg.|$|E
5|$|By the 9th century, the Slavs {{had settled}} the <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast</b> in Pomerania, which {{subsequently}} {{developed into a}} commercial and military power. Along the coastline, remnants of Scandinavian settlements and emporia were to be found. The most important of them was probably the trade settlement and seaport of Truso, located in Prussia. Prussia itself was relatively unaffected by Slavic migration and remained inhabited by Baltic Old Prussians. During the same time, the tribe of the Vistulans (Wiślanie), based in Kraków and the surrounding region, controlled a large area in the south, which they developed and fortified with many strongholds.|$|E
5|$|Danzig was saved, but {{the next}} year the {{strengthened}} in the Ducal Prussia Swedish army took Brodnica, and early in 1629 defeated the Polish units at Górzno. Gustavus Adolphus from his <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast</b> position laid an economic siege against the Commonwealth and ravaged what he had conquered. At this point allied forces under Albrecht von Wallenstein were brought in {{to help keep the}} Swedes in check. Forced by the combined Polish-Austrian action Gustavus had to withdraw from Kwidzyn to Malbork, in process being defeated and almost taken prisoner by Koniecpolski at the Battle of Trzciana.|$|E

5|$|During the First World War, Admiral Fisher was {{prevented}} from ordering an improved {{version of the}} preceding s by a wartime restriction that banned construction of ships larger than light cruisers in 1915. To obtain ships suitable for the doctrinal roles of battlecruisers, such as scouting for fleets and hunting enemy raiders, he settled on ships with the minimal armour of a light cruiser and the armament of a battlecruiser. He justified their existence by claiming he needed fast, shallow-draught ships for his Baltic Project, a plan to invade Germany via its <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} Renown and Courageous classes were {{designed}} for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast.</b> Specifically, they were designed with a reduced draught, which might be important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough freeboard under operational conditions. Roberts argues that {{the focus on the}} Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Poland did {{not follow}} up this victory {{politically}} or militarily. A cease-fire contracted at Stary Targ (the Truce of Altmark) on 26 October 1629 favored the Swedes, who received the right to tax Polish trade moving over the Baltic (3.5% {{of the value of}} goods), retained control of many cities in Royal Prussia, and were recognized as the dominant power on the southern <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast.</b> Koniecpolski exerted little influence on the negotiations, as he had been called back to Ukraine to crush a Tartar incursion.|$|E

His paintings were shown at exhibitions in Germany, Denmark and Holland. Jensen lived in Berlin, but spent much time at the North Sea and <b>Baltic</b> <b>coasts,</b> observing marine landscapes.|$|R
5|$|The Rzucewo culture (named {{after the}} village near Puck where the discoveries took place) {{developed}} from northern {{populations of the}} Corded Ware culture as an offshoot specialized in exploitation of the sea resources and lasted in parallel with their mother culture for a comparable period of time. Their settlements consisting of characteristic sea erosion reinforced houses were located along the Bay of Gdańsk and east of there. They engaged in fishery and hunting, especially of seals, then numerous along the <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast.</b> The Rzucewo culture people produced in special shops the widely used and traded amber decorative items.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th {{century the}} reach and {{influence}} of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. The early to mid-century saw great rises in international trade and domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. Artists from the area attracted patronage from the <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast,</b> the north German and Polish regions, the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland. At first, masters had acted as their own dealers, attending fairs where they could also buy frames, panels and pigments. The mid-century saw the development of art dealership as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.|$|E
5|$|Following {{training}} exercises {{with the}} 32nd U-boat Flotilla from 30 September 1944 to 15 February 1945, U-2336 began her first voyages as a front boat of the 4th U-boat Flotilla on 16 February 1945. However, on 18 February 1945 {{she was involved}} in a collision with , another Type XXIII U-boat, off Heiligendamm on the <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast.</b> U-2344 was sunk, with the loss of 11 of her crew. It took about two months for U-2336 to actually leave her home port of Kiel, which she finally did on 18 April 1945 under a new commander, Kapitänleutnant Emil Klusmeier. Following five days of traveling across the straits of Kattegat and Skagerrak, U-2336 reached Larvik, Norway on 24 April 1945; which was to be her new home port {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|In 1659, {{the war was}} {{characterized}} by Swedish forces defending their strongholds on the southern <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast</b> against allied assaults. A combined force of 17,000 Austrians and 13,000 Brandenburgers led by general Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches invaded Swedish Pomerania, took and burned Greifenhagen, took Wollin island and Damm, besieged Stettin and Greifswald without success, but took Demmin on 9 November. Counterattacks were mounted by general Müller von der Lühnen, who lifted the siege laid on Greifswald by the Brandenburgian prince elector, and major general Paul Wirtz, who from besieged Stettin managed to capture the Brandenburgian ammunition depot at Curau {{and took it to}} Stralsund. The Brandenburgians withdrew ravaging the countryside while retreating.|$|E
5|$|More acute {{threat to}} the Polish–Lithuanian state came from Sweden. The {{balance of power in}} the north had shifted in Sweden's favor, as the Baltic {{neighbor}} was led by King Gustavus Adolphus, a highly able and aggressive military leader, who greatly improved the effectiveness of the Swedish armed forces, while also taking advantage of Protestant zealotry. The Commonwealth, exhausted by the wars with Russia and the Ottoman Empire and lacking allies, was poorly prepared to face this new challenge. Continuous diplomatic maneuvering by Sigismund III made the whole situation look to szlachta like another stage in the King's Swedish dynastic affairs; in reality the Swedish power resolved to take hold of the entire Polish-controlled <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast,</b> and thereby profit from the Commonwealth's maritime trade intermediary control, endangering its basis for independent existence.|$|E
5|$|Caspar David Friedrich {{was born}} on 5 September 1774, in Greifswald, Swedish Pomerania, on the <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast</b> of Germany. The sixth of ten children, he {{was brought up in}} the strict Lutheran creed of his father Adolf Gottlieb Friedrich, a candle-maker and soap boiler. Records of the family's {{financial}} circumstances are contradictory; while some sources indicate the children were privately tutored, others record that they were raised in relative poverty. Caspar David was familiar with death from an early age. His mother, Sophie Dorothea Bechly, died in 1781 when he was just seven. A year later, his sister Elisabeth died, while a second sister, Maria, succumbed to typhus in 1791. Arguably the greatest tragedy of his childhood happened in 1787 when his brother Johann Christoffer died: at the age of thirteen, Caspar David witnessed his younger brother fall through the ice of a frozen lake, and drown. Some accounts suggest that Johann Christoffer perished while trying to rescue Caspar David, who was also in danger on the ice.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{favorable}} economic development, the military potential of 16th century Poland was modest {{in relation to}} the challenges and threats coming from several directions, which included the Ottoman Empire, the Teutonic state, the Habsburgs, and Muscovy. Given the declining military value and willingness of pospolite ruszenie, the bulk of the forces available consisted of professional and mercenary soldiers. Their number and provision depended on szlachta-approved funding (self-imposed taxation and other sources) and tended to be insufficient for any combination of adversaries. The quality of the forces and their command was good, as demonstrated by victories against a seemingly overwhelming enemy. The attainment of strategic objectives was supported by a well-developed service of knowledgeable diplomats and emissaries. Because of the limited resources at the state's disposal, the Jagiellonian Poland had to concentrate on the area most crucial for its security and economic interests, which was the strengthening of Poland's position along the <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following this, the 31st Army drove {{towards the}} <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast.</b> The 331st {{captured}} the rail junction of Landsberg from the march, and Berestov ordered the division northward, unaware {{that it was}} coming {{into the path of}} a powerful German counterstrike to hold open a land link to the rest of Germany. Under pressure, the 331st fell back to the outskirts of Landsberg, and savage fighting ensued. Meanwhile, the German columns led by Waffen SS troops bypassed the town to the south and north, leaving the fighting elements of the division encircled for two days until they were relieved from outside. Meanwhile, the southern German column had rampaged through the mostly-defenseless rear elements of the division, destroying the medical-sanitation battalion, the motor pool, and other units; in total more than 300 men and women were killed and more wounded.|$|E
5|$|In February 1921 {{he met the}} 21-year-old {{photographer}} Charlotte ("Yolla") Niclas; {{the close}} romantic {{relationship between the two}} was to last many years, despite their age difference. The same year, following a family vacation to the <b>Baltic</b> <b>coast,</b> he began preparatory work on his science fiction novel Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants), which would be published in 1924. In 1920 Döblin joined the Association of German Writers (Schutzverband Deutscher Schriftsteller), and in 1924 he became its president. In November 1921 he began reviewing plays for the Prager Tagblatt, and in 1925 joined the Gruppe 1925, a discussion circle of progressive and communist intellectuals including Bertolt Brecht, Johannes R. Becher, Ernst Bloch, Hermann Kasack, Rudolf Leonhard, Walter Mehring, Robert Musil, Joseph Roth, Ernst Toller, Kurt Tucholsky, and Ernst Weiß, among others. It was likely Brecht, who counted Döblin among his significant influences, who introduced him to Erwin Piscator in 1928.|$|E
