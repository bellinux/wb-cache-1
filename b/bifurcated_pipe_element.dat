40|$|Abstract. Steel <b>bifurcated</b> <b>pipe</b> is one {{important}} part of the water diversion buildings in a hydropower station. And its hydraulic characteristics are crucial to reduce the head loss of the bifurcated section. The numerical simulation was carried out with spherical trifurcate branch pipe, shell type trifurcate branch pipe without deflecting plates and shell type trifurcate branch pipe with deflecting plates under a serious of operating conditions based on a case study. After this, the flow conditions and the head losses in the bifurcated sections were analyzed. The shell type trifurcate branch pipe with deflecting plates had the most advantageous hydraulic characteristics of the three schemes. The shell type and the deflecting plates improved the flow condition effectively. The scheme could improve the flow condition and reduce the head loss of the bifurcation section effectively. The results might provide some references to the <b>bifurcated</b> <b>pipe</b> design and operation...|$|R

40|$|An {{integrated}} heat pipe-thermal {{storage system}} was developed {{as part of}} the Organic Rankine Cycle Solar Dynamic Power System solar receiver for space station application. The solar receiver incorporates potassium heat <b>pipe</b> <b>elements</b> to absorb and transfer the solar energy within the receiver cavity. The heat pipes contain thermal energy storage (TES) canisters within the vapor space with a toluene heater tube used as the condenser region of the heat pipe. During the insolation period of the earth orbit, solar energy is delivered to the heat pipe. Part of this thermal energy is delivered to the heater tube and the balance is stored in the TES units. During the eclipse period of earth orbit, the stored energy in the TES units is transferred by the potassium vapor to the toluene heater tube. A developmental heat <b>pipe</b> <b>element</b> was constructed that contains axial arteries and a distribution wick connecting the toluene heater and the TES units to the solar insolation surface of the heat pipe.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a new straight <b>pipe</b> <b>element</b> {{that enables the}} efficient computation of large, three-dimensional deformations in pipes with circular cross-sections. Existing <b>pipe</b> <b>elements</b> have difficulties in applications including three-dimensional large deformations. To overcome these diffculties, the new <b>element</b> (called RC <b>pipe</b> <b>element</b> in this work), which supports rigid-body and constant-strain modes, is modeled using curvilinear shell coordinates and sinusoidal interpolation functions. This new element captures all stresses except the normal stress across the shell thickness (i. e. small thickness is assumed). Euler parameters are used to describe rotational rigid-body modes and are incorporated into the element's vector of degrees of freedom. Under general loading (axial, transverse, bending and torsion), the element allows large ovalization of its cross section and large, three-dimensional angular changes in the orientation of its reference axis. The formulation used to derive the element incorporates the nonlinear coupling between torsional and bending deformations. Results of the static analysis are presented for the stresses and deformations produced by combined bending and torsional loads. A comparison of these results to corresponding quantities generated by ABAQUS using {{a large number of}} 24 degree-of-freedom shell elements indicates excellent agreement and significant gains in computational efficiency because of a reduction in number of degrees of freedom. Results are also presented for the behaviour of the element in the presence of large rotational motion with internal pressure...|$|R

40|$|The temperature, the {{deformation}} and {{the stress}} field in thermo-mechanical problems {{play a very}} important role in engineering applications. This paper presents a finite element algorithm developed to perform the thermal and mechanical analysis of structural steel piping systems subjected to elevated temperatures. The new <b>pipe</b> <b>element</b> with 22 degrees of freedom has a displacement field that results from the superposition of a beam displacement, with the displacement field associated with the section distortion. Having determined the temperature field, the consequent thermal displacement produced in the piping systems due to the thermal variation can be calculated. The temperature rise produces thermal expansion and a consequent increase of pipe length in the structural elements. For small values of the ratio of the pipe thickness to mean radius, the thermal behaviour can be calculated with adequate precision using a one-dimensional mesh approach, with thermal boundary conditions of an axisymmetric type across the pipe section. With this condition, several case studies of piping systems subjected to elevated temperatures and mechanical loads are presented and compared with corresponding results from commercial finite element codes. The main advantage of this formulation is associated with reduced time for mesh generation with a low number of elements and nodes.

40|$|The {{research}} {{involves the}} development of a discrete lattice approach for modelling heat transfer, which can be an attractive alternative to other numerical approaches, such as the nite element method. In this work, the spatial arrangement of the lattice elements is determined by the Delaunay triangulation and the Voronoi tessellation. The objective of the present work is to investigate in more detail this type of lattice model for heat transfer. In the lattice models studied here the domain to be analysed is discretised by a network of discrete lattice elements. The spatial arrangement of these elements is determined by connecting nodes placed within the domain. There are two methods to determine the connections between the nodes in the domain. In the rst one, the connections are dened as the edges of the Delaunay triangulation. In the second method, the nodes are dened by the edges of Voronoi cells, based on a Voronoi tessellation of the domain. These connections dene the arrangement of the <b>pipe</b> <b>elements,</b> which are used to perform the heat transfer analysis. The cross-sections of the <b>pipe</b> <b>elements</b> for the two approaches are chosen in several dierent ways to be consistent with the discretisation approach.
