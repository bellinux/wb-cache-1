5|$|Tekken series {{producer}} Katsuhiro Harada teased {{an announcement}} on his Twitter feed on September 17, 2010 ("TGS Sep 18(Sat) at Tougeki Booth. I'll announce something :D"). It {{was rumored to}} be something related to Tekken X Street Fighter or Tekken 7. The game was announced to be Tekken Tag Tournament 2, sequel to Tekken Tag Tournament, on September 18, 2010 at the Tougeki event as promised. Producer Katsuhiro Harada stated that the game engine would <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> one used in Tekken 6. The release of the arcade version {{of the game in}} Japan was originally planned for summer 2011, but due to complications derived from the Great East Japan earthquake, the arcade release was postponed until Autumn 2011. At the World Cyber Games 2010, Harada stated that the console version would feature additional console-exclusive returning characters and bonus gameplay modes. He also suggested that the release of the console version of the game would take place between the releases of Street Fighter X Tekken and Tekken X Street Fighter.|$|E
5|$|When Árbenz {{was sworn}} in as defense {{minister}} under President Arévalo, he became the first to hold the portfolio since it had previously been known as the Ministry of War. In the fall of 1947, Árbenz, as defense minister, objected to the deportation of several workers after they had been accused of being communists. Well-known communist José Manuel Fortuny was intrigued by this action and decided to visit him, and found Árbenz to <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stereotypical Central American military officer. That first meeting was followed by others until Árbenz invited Fortuny to his house for discussions that usually extended for hours. Like Árbenz, Fortuny was inspired by a fierce nationalism and a burning desire to improve the conditions of the Guatemalan people, and, like Árbenz, he sought answers in Marxist theory. This relationship would strongly influence Árbenz in the future.|$|E

50|$|Black {{proposed}} a theory {{where there is}} a zero-beta return which <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> risk-free return. This fits the data better since <b>the</b> zero-beta return <b>is</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> risk-free return. It still presumes, on principle, that there is higher return for higher beta.|$|R

For covert redirect, an attacker could use a real website instead by corrupting the site with a malicious login popup dialogue box. This makes covert redirect different from others.|$|E

25|$|International cuisine {{and fast}} food are {{popular in the}} cities. Blending local and foreign recipes (fusion food), such as Pakistani Chinese cuisine, is common in large urban centres. Furthermore, {{as a result of}} {{lifestyle}} changes, ready made masala mixes (mixed and ready to use spices) are becoming increasingly popular. However, given the diversity of the people of Pakistan, cuisines generally differ from home to home and may <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mainstream Pakistani cuisine.|$|E
25|$|According to University of Helsinki {{food safety}} {{professor}} Marina Heinonen, more than 90% of dietary supplement health claims are incorrect. In addition, ingredients listed {{have been found}} to <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> contents. For example, Consumer Reports reported unsafe levels of arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury in several of the protein powders that were tested. Also, the CBC found that protein spiking (the addition of amino acid filler to manipulate analysis) was not uncommon, however many of the companies involved challenged their claim.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1993, the BSA simply {{reviewed}} the programs developed by each faith. After requests for new awards in 1993, the BSA established a policy statement outlining requirements for recognition. To gain recognition, a proposed program {{must be approved}} by the BSA Religious Relationships Committee, the religious organization must charter at least 25 units, and the program must have a national scope. The medal or badge design must also be approved and must <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> emblems of other programs.|$|E

25|$|Genealogists {{have also}} disputed Haley's {{research}} and conclusions in Roots. The Gambian griot {{turned out not}} to be a real griot, and the story of Kunta Kinte appears to have been a case of circular reporting, in which Haley's own words were repeated back to him. None of the written records in Virginia and North Carolina line up with the Roots story until after the Civil War. Some elements of Haley's family story can be found in the written records, but the most likely genealogy would <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> one described in Roots.|$|E
25|$|The Arctic Star, the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal and the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces can, {{or could}} be, awarded to South Africans after 6 April 1952. Should the 1954 South African ruling {{on the order}} of wear of British awards be {{strictly}} applied, the position of the Arctic Star in the South African order of wear would therefore <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, with the result that the Arctic Star would take precedence after the Chief C.D.F. Commendation Medal of the Republic of Ciskei and before the Korea Medal of the Union of South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Some {{supporters}} of Taiwan independence, including former president Lee Teng-hui, {{have called for}} the abandonment of the flag, {{and there are a}} number of alternate designs for a specifically Taiwanese flag. However, the prospects for this are not high given that changing the flag requires a constitutional amendment; that the current flag has a huge amount of support among pan-Blue supporters and grudging acceptance among moderate independence supporters; and because changing the flag might cause political tension with the PRC. During the 2004 ROC legislative elections, it was briefly suggested that if the pan-green coalition won the elections that it would force the KMT to change the party emblem to <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> flag. This proposal generated a few days of controversy and was then quickly forgotten.|$|E

25|$|Jenkens, Gaw and Phillips then {{met with}} a faculty {{committee}} to seek official recognition for their new fraternity. The faculty members were reluctant to recognize a sixth fraternity in a school with only 300 students, especially as {{more than half the}} members would be soon-to graduate seniors. Additionally, another national fraternity already existed using the name Sigma Phi. The founders responded that their new fraternity would <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> others at Richmond, as was being founded upon biblical, egalitarian principles, and new members would quickly be taken in from the undergraduate classes to increase the new fraternity's size, and the fraternity's name was still open to debate. With these assurances from the founders, the faculty committee approved the new fraternity's request for official recognition. Shortly afterwards, the founders met and decided to rename the fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} fallen angel is the archdevil Iblis (Arabic: إِبْلِيس) or Azazil (Arabic: عزازيل Azāzīl). Alternatively, he {{is considered}} to be a jinni who was either once ascended to heaven, but later banished from there or counts as the father of the jinn. As a fallen angel, the jinn existed already before the fall of Iblis and the Jinn, like humans, do not ascend to Heaven before death. Iblis is assumed to <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Jinn. While the Jinn are made out of smokeless fire, he is believed to be composed of another kind of fire (according to Ibn Abbas from the fire of samum). Unlike the Christian belief, Iblis is not generally in charge of non-angelic spirits, but over the satanic Jinn (demons). In parts of folklore, some other angels were convinced by Iblis to distrust the creation of human and have fallen with him, now roaming as demons on earth or in hell.|$|E
25|$|Subtitle {{translation}} can <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{translation of}} written text. Usually, {{during the process}} of creating subtitles for a film or television program, the picture and each sentence of the audio are analyzed by the subtitle translator; also, the subtitle translator {{may or may not have}} access to a written transcript of the dialog. Especially in the field of commercial subtitles, the subtitle translator often interprets what is meant, rather than translating the manner in which the dialog is stated; that is, the meaning is more important than the form—the audience does not always appreciate this, as it can be frustrating for people who are familiar with some of the spoken language; spoken language may contain verbal padding or culturally implied meanings that cannot be conveyed in the written subtitles. Also, the subtitle translator may also condense the dialog to achieve an acceptable reading speed, whereby purpose is more important than form.|$|E

25|$|Heating {{an ideal}} mixture of two {{volatile}} substances A and B (with A having the higher volatility, or lower boiling point) in a batch distillation setup (such as in an apparatus {{depicted in the}} opening figure) {{until the mixture is}} boiling results in a vapor above the liquid which contains a mixture of A and B. The ratio between A and B in the vapor will <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ratio in the liquid: the ratio in the liquid will be determined by how the original mixture was prepared, while the ratio in the vapor will be enriched in the more volatile compound, A (due to Raoult's Law, see above). The vapor goes through the condenser and is removed from the system. This in turn means that the ratio of compounds in the remaining liquid is now different from the initial ratio (i.e., more enriched in B than the starting liquid).|$|E

Erhard described to Bartley what the revelation experience felt like: [...] "What happened had no form. It was timeless, unbounded, ineffable, beyond language." [...] He told Bartley that he realized: [...] "I had to 'clean up' my life. I had to acknowledge and correct the lies in my life. I saw that the lies that I told about others — my wanting my family, or Ellen (his second wife), or anyone else, to <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> way that they are -- came from lies that I told about myself -- my wanting to <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> way that I was." ...|$|E
