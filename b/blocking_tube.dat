40|$|Interference {{by human}} anti-animal immunoglobulins, {{commonly}} referred to as heterophile antibodies, in immu-nologic assays is known to be an important consideration for medical testing laboratories (1 – 3). Although auto-mated immunometric assays are formulated to reduce these effects, it is unlikely that complete elimination occurs (2), and artifactual results attributable to hetero-phile antibodies have been reported for some assays (4, 5). Such results often are identified by addition of blocking agents to the samples before assay. A simple sample pretreatment method uses a commercially avail-able <b>blocking</b> <b>tube,</b> HBT. An alternative technique uses polyethylene glycol (PEG) to precipitate immunoglobu-lin-sized molecules before assay.

40|$|Background: Three adult {{patients}} {{presented with}} unexpectedly high thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations that were discordant with clinical and biochemical findings of euthyroid or hyperthyroid status. Methods: Antibody {{interference in the}} TSH immunoassay (Roche) was investigated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) -pretreatment, heterophilic <b>blocking</b> <b>tube</b> (HBT) -pretreatment, rheumatoid factor (RF) testing, immunofixation, protein A adsorption, and gel filtration chromatography (GFC). Results: PEG-precipitation yielded < 20 % recovery of serum TSH, whereas HBT-pretreatment did not decrease TSH test results. RF-testing and immunofixation were negative. Protein A adsorption and GFC demonstrated the presence of TSH-immunoglobulin complexes in serum. Conclusions: Interference by TSH-immunoglobulin complexes should be ruled out in euthyroid and hyperthyroid patients presenting with inappropriately increased or non-suppressed TSH values.

40|$|Organ-specific neoantigens (TA) shed {{from the}} tumours of {{patients}} with metastatic breast or colon cancer and which had filtered into the urine were partially purified {{by a combination of}} physicochemical methods and affinity chromatography. TA activity of the isolated materials was monitored by the <b>blocking</b> <b>Tube</b> LAI assay. Urinary protein was precipitated by 80 % saturated ammonium sulphate. Albumin was removed by affinity chromatography with blue Sepharose CL- 6 B. Affinity columns of human IgG were prepared from sera of patients whose leucocytes were LAI+ to the breast- or colon-cancer extracts. The anti-breast-TA affinity column bound the TA in the urine {{of patients with}} metastatic breast cancer but not that of patients with metastatic colon cancer. The TA in urine of patients with metastatic colon cancer was bound by the anti-colon-TA affinity column. Analysis by SDS PAGE revealed that the isolates with and without TA activity were composed mostly of urinary protein which had bound nonspecifically to the human IgG affinity columns. With an affinity column of anti-NHS and Protein A, some of the contaminants were removed, to reveal SDD PAGE unique bands at about 38, 000 and 12, 000 mol. wt in the isolate with breast-TA activity. Rabbit antisera, raised to the material that had bound nonspecically to the anti-breast-TA affinity column, were used as an anti-nonspecific affinity column to remove the contaminants in the isolates from the affinity columns of anti-breast TA and anti-colon TA. After passage through the anti-nonspecific affinity column, the material that contained the putative breast or colon cancer TA revealed a unique band at about 38, 000 - 40, 000 mol. wt and residual fine bands at about 25, 000 - 30, 000 mol. wt. Both the control material and material with TA activity had similar bands at about 25, 000 and 50, 000 mol. wt.

40|$|Creatine kinase MB isoform (CK-MB) is a {{biochemical}} marker {{that is used}} to evaluate patients with suspected acute myocar-dial infarction. Rapid immunoassays to measure CK-MB mass concentration use various monoclonal anti-CK-MB antibodies, and these have been reported to be highly sensitive, specific, and free of interference [1]. Here, we report the first case of a false-positive CK-MB result (as determined by a mass assay) from a patient who underwent nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. A 78 -yr-old man was ad-mitted to the Urology department of Ilsan Paik Hospital in Goy-ang, Korea, for partial nephrectomy for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. He developed dyspnea and tachycardia at three days after the surgery. The electrocardiogram revealed atrial fi-brillation. CK-MB mass concentrations, CK activity, and N-termi-nal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) levels increased to 10. 44 μg/L (reference range, < 6. 8 μg/L), 1, 533 U/L (< 171 U/L), and 15, 927 ng/L (526 ng/L), respectively. However, the troponin I level was normal (Fig. 1). Acute myocardial infarction was sus-pected because CK-MB mass concentrations were increased; however, the results of the transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac angiography were unremarkable. During the week following admission, the patient’s CK-MB mass concentration using CK-MB VIDAS test (Vidas-Biomerieux, Marcy-I’Etoile, France) increased to more than 300 μg/L.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In drug {{monitoring}} assays {{the most common}} interferences are due to hematocrit, other drugs or their metabolites, while the interference by heterophilic antibodies has been reported only when measuring endogenous molecules. In the present paper a heterophilic antibody interference in the tacrolimus measurement is described. METHODS: Samples from a patient treated with tacrolimus were analyzed on RxL Dimension analyzer. Ranging drug concentrations from 49 to 12. 5 microg/L, even after the interruption of the treatment, confirmation analysis were performed using heterophilic <b>blocking</b> <b>tubes</b> before tacrolimus measurement on the same analyzer, then testing the samples on V-Twin System, finally incubating the samples with chlorophenol red beta-d-galactopyranoside, beta-galactosidase, polyclonal mouse IgG, protein A and Protein G resin. RESULTS: The elevated tacrolimus concentrations were due {{to the presence of}} an interference attributable to heterophilic antibodies, as confirmed by treating the samples with heterophilic <b>blocking</b> <b>tubes</b> and protein G resin. CONCLUSIONS: a) The interference caused by heterophilic antibodies can be found not only in immunoassays measuring endogenous molecules, but also in those for exogenous molecules; b) the pre-treatment sample procedure, which represent the main difference between the methods affected and unaffected by the interference, is a fundamental step in removing the antibodies responsible of the interference...|$|R

40|$|In this review, {{we discuss}} the {{identification}} of distinct matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors that differentially control the processes of capillary tube formation (morphogenesis) versus capillary tube regression in three-dimensional (3 D) collagen matrices. This work directly relates to both granulation tissue formation and regression during wound repair. The membrane metalloproteinase, MT 1 -MMP (MMP- 14), is required for endothelial cell (EC) tube formation using in vitro assays that mimic vasculogenesis or angiogenic sprouting in 3 D collagen matrices. These events are markedly blocked by small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppression of MT 1 -MMP in ECs or by addition of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) - 2, - 3, and - 4 but not TIMP- 1. In contrast, MMP- 1 and MMP- 10 are strongly induced during EC tube formation to regulate the process of tube regression (following activation by serine proteases) rather than formation. TIMP- 1, which selectively inhibits soluble MMPs, <b>blocks</b> <b>tube</b> regression by inhibiting MMP- 1 and MMP- 10 while having no influence on EC tube formation. siRNA suppression of MMP- 1 and MMP- 10 markedly <b>blocks</b> <b>tube</b> regression without affecting tube formation. Furthermore, we discuss that pericyte-induced stabilization of EC tube networks in our model system appears to occur through EC-derived TIMP- 2 and pericyte-derived TIMP- 3 to block both the capillary tube formation and regression pathways...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{report on}} a case that {{demonstrates}} the successful treatment of tube blockage of the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve at its aqueous entry site by Nd:YAG laser membranectomy. Method: We report a case of refractory intraocular pressure elevation in a patient with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome after glaucoma drainage device due to <b>blocked</b> <b>tube</b> from the iridocorneal endothelial syndrome membrane. In July 2014, our patient presented with sudden right eye elevated intraocular pressure to 67 mmHg despite a well-controlled intraocular pressure {{in the range of}} teens with timolol alone over the last 2 years. Gonioscopy showed total synechial angle closure and increasing her medical treatment failed to control the intraocular pressure. Ahmed glaucoma valve was implanted successfully. However, recurrence of raised intraocular pressure from partial tube retraction and tube blockage at its aqueous entry site by an endothelial membrane was noted at 2 weeks after the surgery. Nd:YAG laser membranectomy was performed on 2 occasions to restore the patency of the tube shunt. After the second laser membranectomy, the patient’s intraocular pressure returned to, and remained at, normal level since. Conclusion: Tube occlusion by membrane is a well-known complication following glaucoma drainage device tube in patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome. Nd:YAG membranectomy is effective to restore the patency of tube lumen without subjecting patients to more invasive surgical interventions including tube extender or another glaucoma drainage device. However, more studies are required to ascertain the long term effect of laser membranectomy to a <b>blocked</b> <b>tube,</b> in comparison to other treatment modalities. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of using laser membranectomy alone in treating Ahmed glaucoma valve tube obstruction due to a retracted <b>tube</b> <b>blocked</b> by endothelial membrane. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

For many years the fallopian tube assessment was done by laparoscopy or hysterography, until the advent of color Doppler and various contrast agents. The purpose of this study was to introduce a new contrast agent i. e. gaseous spring water for the evaluation of tubal patency as an alternate to existing available contrast agents based on galactose matrix air bubbles, which are expensive and not easily available in third world countries. Materials and MethodsThe technique used is same as used in other procedures i. e. insertion of a hysterosalpingosonography (HSS) catheter into the uterine cavity, instilling fluid/contrast agent and with the help of endovaginal probe visualizing the movement of echoes into the tubes and the observation of fluid in the pouch of Douglas. ResultsWe examined 721 patients from January 2006 to December 2007. We used about 7 mL of gaseous spring water per patient on an average. We found that 578 (80. 1 %) patients had patent tubes, 70 (9. 7 %) patients had unilateral <b>blocked</b> <b>tubes</b> and 59 (8. 1 %) patients had bilateral <b>blocked</b> <b>tubes.</b> Two (0. 27 %) patients were found to have one <b>tube</b> <b>blocked,</b> but when rescanned in the next cycle due to spasm, it was found to be patent.
