That is: a basic-rate taxpayer's contribution of £80 will be grossed up to £100 on payment to the provider. Higher-rate taxpayers can claim additional <b>relief</b> through their <b>tax</b> return if they have one, or by otherwise contacting HMRC (neither being a higher rate taxpayer, or having paid too much tax, are triggers for HMRC to request that a tax return is completed).

50|$|By {{comparison}} with other means tested benefits, the income treatment of claimants of tax credits is especially generous; it permits deduction of the full gross amount (rather than 50% net)of any individual pension contributions and any Gift aid payments. Since increases in income are subject to withdrawal at 39%(in the initial range), such reductions are effectively 'rebated' {{at the same rate}} through the tax credits received. Thus, while a pension (or Gift Aid) contribution of £100 will cost the employee £80 (after <b>basic</b> rate <b>tax</b> <b>relief)</b> directly from net pay, it attracts an additional £39 in tax credits; so the true cost is only £41.|$|R
