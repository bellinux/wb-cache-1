5|$|Damage was {{minor in}} {{southeast}} North Carolina. Moderate winds inflicted isolated shingle and siding damage along barrier islands. The winds downed several trees, some onto cars and houses. Brief power outages were also reported. Beach erosion damaged a bridge in <b>Bald</b> <b>Head</b> Island, as well. In Chowan County, a business {{parking lot was}} under several feet of water due to flash flooding. One person was indirectly killed in Carteret County when trying to restore electricity.|$|E
5|$|In North Carolina, above-normal tides caused minor beach erosion. Rainfall {{near the}} {{coastline}} reached 5.6inches (142mm) in Greenville. Moisture {{from the storm}} led to increased rainfall further inland, peaking at 8.72inches (221mm) in Butner. Raleigh-Durham recorded a two-day rainfall total of 5.79inches (147mm), which was the highest two-day total at the station since Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Heavy rainfall caused flash flooding in Martin County, where several roads were closed. Moderate winds were reported in the state, with gusts peaking at 49mph (79km/h) on <b>Bald</b> <b>Head</b> Island. The storm spawned at least three tornadoes in the state, including an F2twister near Pantego that damaged two houses and a farm.|$|E
5|$|Molly {{lost her}} {{championship}} to Victoria in a Four-Way Elimination match on February 23, 2004. The feud {{led to a}} Hair versus Title match at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, which Molly lost, resulting in her having her head shaved. Greenwald maintains {{that it was her}} idea to have her head shaved, suggesting the idea to Vince McMahon months before the match occurred because she wanted to do something shocking at WrestleMania. Over the next few months, in storyline, she desperately tried to disguise her <b>bald</b> <b>head</b> using loose-fitting wigs. Later in 2004, Molly feuded with Stacy Keibler, overpowering Stacy on the mat and pinning her in three consecutive occasions, the last one occurring in a number one contender's match.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most of his}} noble relatives, John {{opposed the}} tyrannical regime of Andronikos I Komnenos (r. 1182–85), and {{had been forced to}} sign written pledge of loyalty to the emperor. Nevertheless, on 11 September 1185, when his nephew Isaac Angelos killed Andronikos I's chief henchman, Stephen Hagiochristophorites, and sought {{sanctuary}} in the Hagia Sophia cathedral, John and his eldest son Isaac rushed to his side, fearing the Emperor's retribution. By the next day, a popular uprising provoked by Isaac Angelos' act of defiance had brought down the regime of Andronikos I, but Isaac Angelos hesitated to be crowned emperor. According to Niketas Choniates and Theodore Skoutariotes, John then bared his own head and offered his own <b>bald</b> <b>head</b> to be crowned, but the assembled people violently opposed this, refusing to be ruled by a man so old after the equally elderly Andronikos I, and Isaac Angelos was crowned.|$|E
5|$|With a {{director}} finally secured, the next hurdle was finishing the script, which {{had gone through}} several revisions by numerous writers. The initial villain of the film was Ernst Stavro Blofeld; however Kevin McClory, who owned the film rights to Thunderball forced an injunction on Eon Productions against using the character of Blofeld, or his international criminal organisation, SPECTRE, which delayed production of the film further. The villain was later changed from Blofeld to Stromberg so that the injunction would {{not interfere with the}} production. Christopher Wood was later brought in by Lewis Gilbert to complete the script. Although Fleming had requested that no elements from his original book be used, the film characters of Jaws and Sandor are based on the novel characters Sol Horror and Sluggsy Morant, respectively. Horror is described as having steel-capped teeth, while Sluggsy had a clear <b>bald</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Charleston, South Carolina, the {{hurricane}} washed aground several ships and uprooted numerous trees, though {{damage to the}} city harbor was minimal. The lighthouse on North Island flanking Winyah Bay collapsed under high winds, and in Georgetown proper, {{the hurricane}} {{was considered to be}} the worst since the 1804 Antigua–Charleston hurricane, despite its storm surge being of a lesser size. A cotton field covering 94acres was ruined nearby. At Smithville, North Carolina, numerous ships experienced damage, while considerable destruction to structures was observed, with many wharves wrecked. Meanwhile, at Wilmington, the hurricane inflicted widespread damage, with many wharves severely damaged, and significant losses sustained by salt, sugar, rice, and lumber industries. The gable sections of three masonry houses were destroyed by wind or water, and wooden houses suffered especially badly, with many obliterated and those under construction flattened. One individual died after a wall collapsed and several slaves were killed, one by drowning, at local plantations. At <b>Bald</b> <b>Head</b> Island, the United States Revenue Cutter Service vessel Governor Williams was stripped of its foremast and subsequently ran ashore before being repaired and continuing on its journey. A second boat owned by the agency, the Diligence, was tethered at port in Wilmington and endured no damage; similarly, little impact occurred at New Bern. Throughout the storm, several vessels and supplies of stranded sailors were driven aground along the North Carolinan coast. On the Bogue Banks, the remains of the Adolphus and Atlantic were discovered, and at the Core Banks, a dead body was washed ashore, partially eaten by fish.|$|E

25|$|Particularly at Cape Fear's outlet to the Atlantic, {{the area}} was {{enclosed}} by a half dozen Confederate positions. The river flowed to the sea through two relatively shallow inlets, which were partitioned by Smith Island now <b>Bald</b> <b>Head</b> Island. The existence of two inlets resulted in a crucial advantage: guided by the Confederates, the blockade runners were capable of avoiding the Union ships. They simply had to change course unexpectedly, alternatively between the two inlets.|$|E
25|$|Lex Luthor has {{traditionally}} lacked superpowers or a dual identity and typically appears with a <b>bald</b> <b>head.</b> He periodically wears his Warsuit, a high-tech battle suit giving him enhanced strength, flight, advanced weaponry, and other capabilities.

He is well known for his philanthropy, donating vast sums of money to Metropolis over the years, funding parks, foundations, and charities.|$|E
25|$|Many Conservative {{politicians}} of generations following Macleod recalled {{him as a}} highly effective speaker. His <b>bald</b> <b>head</b> and piercing gaze gave him a striking physical presence, {{and he was one}} of the most powerful platform speakers of his generation, in the league of Churchill or Aneurin Bevan. He was also a superb negotiator with a grasp of detail. Never one to suffer fools, by middle age his disability made him very short-tempered and impatient with people.|$|E
5000|$|The eponymous Chuck Rock is an overweight, square-jawed caveman {{characterized}} by loutish and lewd behaviour perhaps {{influenced by the}} lad culture of the 1990s. Chuck has a limited vocabulary (his favourite phrase being [...] "Unga Bunga" [...] and not much else), has a <b>balding</b> <b>head</b> cut into a punk-style mohawk, eats whole dinosaur-steaks raw in one bite, and has a penchant for picking up rocks and throwing them at things, hence his name. Chuck is a guitarist and singer (or shouter) in a rock band along with some other cavemen, his foxy blonde wife Ophelia Rock, and a long-haired dinosaur bass player; and whilst on stage he wears a long wig to hide his <b>balding</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{donors are}} painted life size, {{and thus to}} a much larger scale than the saints; this is most {{noticeable}} in the relative sizes of their heads and hands. Their bright and warmly colored clothes contrast sharply with the grey of the lifeless saints. Van Eyck brings {{a high degree of}} realism to his portrayal of the Vijdts; his study of the ailing couple in old age is unflinching and far from flattering. Details that reveal their aging include Joost's watering eyes, wrinkled hands, warts, <b>bald</b> <b>head</b> and stubble streaked with gray. The folds of both figures' skin are meticulously detailed, as are their protruding veins and fingernails. They are generally thought to be among the final panels completed for the altarpiece, and are so dated to 1431 or the early months of 1432.|$|E
25|$|In 458 BC, he {{returned}} to Sicily for the last time, visiting the city of Gela where he died in 456 or 455BC. Valerius Maximus wrote that he was killed outside the city by a tortoise dropped by an eagle which had mistaken his <b>bald</b> <b>head</b> for a rock suitable for shattering the shell of the reptile. Pliny, in his Naturalis Historiæ, adds that Aeschylus had been staying outdoors to avoid a prophecy {{that he would be}} killed by a falling object. But this story may be legendary and due to a misunderstanding of the iconography on Aeschylus's tomb. Aeschylus's work was so respected by the Athenians that after his death, his were the only tragedies allowed to be restaged in subsequent competitions. His sons Euphorion and Euæon and his nephew Philocles also became playwrights.|$|E
25|$|Kenzo Suzuki only {{wrestled}} {{one more}} match for CMLL after losing his hair, showing off his <b>bald</b> <b>head</b> {{two weeks later}} on the December 29, 2006 Super Viernes where he teamed with El Terrible and Pierroth Jr. as the team lost to Dos Caras Jr., Lizmark Jr. and Rey Bucanero. While Suzuki left the promotion Corleone would continue to work for CMLL for a while, turning tecnico later on, partially due to the positive response of the Arena Mexico crowd. Shocker and Universo 2000 did not team up after the Sin Piedad victory. Los Guerreros del Infierno would hold the CMLL World Trios Championship to the Los Perros del Mal team of Perro Aguayo Jr., Mr. Águila and Héctor Garza. The Hiroka/Dark Angel storyline was ended without a proper resolution as Hiroka lost the CMLL World Women's Championship to Lady Apache only 10 days after the event.|$|E

500|$|Promotions began {{shortly after}} {{recording}} for {{the album was}} finished. Initially, they served as the opening act for Nine Inch Nails on the 2000 Fragility v2.0 tour, but subsequently embarked {{on a number of}} headlining tours all over the world, touring for around eight months straight. As Keenan was well known through his other band, he would often wear long wigs on his otherwise <b>bald</b> <b>head</b> when performing, to distinguish himself from his Tool persona. The album produced three singles as well: [...] "Judith", [...] "3 Libras", and [...] "The Hollow". All three performed well commercially; peaking at fourth, twelfth, and fourteenth on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart respectively.|$|E
500|$|One {{thread of}} {{critical}} analysis of this tale focuses on the possibly racist implications of Poe's plot and imagery. One such plot element is the black cook who leads the mutiny on the Grampus and is its most bloodthirsty participant. Dirk Peters, a hybrid of white and Native American ancestry, is described as having a ferocious appearance, with long, protruding teeth, bowed legs, and a <b>bald</b> <b>head</b> like [...] "the head of most negroes." [...] The brilliant whiteness of the final figure in the novel contrasts with the dark-skinned savages and such a contrast may call to mind the escalating racial tensions over the question of slavery in the United States as Poe was writing the novel.|$|E
