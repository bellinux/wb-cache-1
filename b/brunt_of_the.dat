5|$|While many reviews {{applauded the}} single-player campaign, the {{multiplayer}} mode bore the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's criticism, with MacDonald, Speer and Miller all finding fault with it, describing it as lackluster and {{stating that the}} difference between the developer's vision for the game mode and the finished product made it difficult to enjoy.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{relatively}} weak and disorganized nature of the storm, impact throughout its path was widespread, but not particularly severe. Puerto Rico bore the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm, followed by the United States Virgin Islands, then the Dominican Republic. Debby was attributed to about $735,000 in damage and 1indirect fatality, which occurred in Puerto Rico when a man fell off a roof while attempting to remove a satellite dish.|$|E

5|$|Keith's {{slow and}} erratic {{movement}} {{caused it to}} produce strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central America. Belize bore the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm, with about $280 million in damage and 19 confirmed fatalities, primarily related to flooding.

5|$|National governments, {{domestic}} non-governmental organizations, {{and international}} aid agencies established hundreds of shelters, evacuated {{hundreds of thousands}} of people, raised millions of dollars of resources, and rallied thousands of rescue workers as the powerful hurricane churned through the Caribbean.

5|$|As {{early as}} September 13, {{residents}} were made {{aware that a}} storm might strike parts of Ireland with hurricane-force winds. Two days later, forecasters believed the storm would take a more southerly course towards France. This forecast was later withdrawn as the storm failed to turn eastward. Consequently, gale warnings were issued for much of western Ireland {{on the morning of}} September 16, hours before the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm arrived.

25|$|<b>The</b> crisis <b>of</b> morale {{occurred}} {{mainly in}} the infantry, which had borne <b>the</b> overwhelming <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> casualties since <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. Branches such as the heavy artillery, which was far behind the front lines, and the cavalry regiments that were still mounted remained unaffected by the mutinies, providing detachments to round up deserters and restore order. Only 12 field artillery regiments were affected by <b>the</b> crisis <b>of</b> indiscipline.|$|R
5|$|By 9 April, the {{pressure}} was decreasing on the New Zealand positions as the Germans shifted their offensive north to the area around Armentières. While {{the bulk of the}} New Zealand Division remained on the Somme and consolidated its defences, some of its artillery went to reinforce the British forces bearing the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> renewed German attacks. Casualties for this period of the war were high; nearly 1,000 of the division's personnel were killed through March and April and almost 2,700 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|CBO {{estimated}} {{that of the}} 12 million with private insurance via the ACA exchanges in 2017, about 10 million receive premium tax credit subsidies and will be shielded from premium increases, as their after-subsidy premiums are limited {{as a percentage of}} income under the ACA. However, those 2 million who do not receive subsidies face the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20%+ premium increases, without subsidy assistance. This may adversely impact enrollment in 2018 and beyond. Another 13 million who are covered under the ACA's Medicaid expansion (in the 31 states that chose to expand coverage) should not be directly affected by Trump's action.|$|E
5|$|In {{an earlier}} {{disaster}} in May 1901, three underground explosions at the colliery killed 81 miners. The inquest {{established that the}} colliery had high levels of airborne coal dust, which would have exacerbated the explosion and carried it further into the mine workings. The cause of the 1913 explosion is unknown, but the subsequent inquiry thought the most likely cause was a spark from underground signalling equipment that could have ignited any firedamp present. The miners in {{the east side of}} the workings were evacuated, but the men in the western section bore the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explosion, fire and afterdamp—a poisonous mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen left after an explosion.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sector}} of Longwy, Sedan and Namur, where the Ardennes and the River Meuse meet, the French Ninth Army and French Second Army were made up chiefly of poor quality divisions. Reinforcements were minimal, and those units were {{equipped}} with obsolete weapons. The resources at {{the disposal of}} the two Series B divisions, the 55th and later 71s Infantry Divisions, who were to bear the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack, were weak. They had almost no Regular officers and they had not been broken-in to war conditions by being in contact with the enemy.|$|E
5|$|In the stalemate, the Belgians {{studied the}} Italians' tactics; they would post pairs of snipers and {{artillery}} spotters in trees guarded at the bases by infantry squads. Their artillery barrages were usually avoided by Belgian patrols, though they would continue {{up to an}} hour after they withdrew. On 21 April, the Italians launched a large counterattack. After a two-hour bombardment, Eritrean troops armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades and covered by Galla snipers penetrated the Belgians' left and right flanks. With Van der Meerch's battalion suffering the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assault, the Belgians retreated behind a pair of hills that obscured them from Italian observers, which the latter then seized.|$|E
5|$|In their Bounty histories, both Hough and Alexander {{maintain}} that the men were not at a stage close to mutiny, however sorry they were to leave Tahiti. The journal of James Morrison, the boatswain's mate, supports this. The events that followed, Hough suggests, were determined in the three weeks following the departure, when Bligh's anger and intolerance reached paranoid proportions. Christian was a particular target, always seeming to bear the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> captain's rages. Unaware {{of the effects of}} his behaviour on his officers and crew, Bligh would forget these displays instantly and attempt to resume normal conversation.|$|E

He feigns patriotism and suggests that the two engage in a statutory duel. He explains that they will hide cards up their sleeves, guaranteeing victory to Ludwig. When the plot unfolds, Ludwig will bear <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> it. <b>The</b> next day, when the Act authorizing statutory duels expires, Rudolph {{can come back to}} life unharmed.

Additionally, 13fatalities occurred, all of them due to drowning; 11deaths occurred offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, while the remaining two were reported in east-central Texas.

5|$|The <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{tropical}} cyclone's {{damage was}} inflicted upon coastal areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal. A total of 6,240people were killed {{as a result}} of the storm, with 5,708in Bangladesh and 538in West Bengal. Many of the deaths were a result of the destruction of homes or electrocution after strong winds toppled power poles across the region. Along the coast of Bangladesh, strong storm surge caused heavy infrastructure damage and contributed in wiping out an estimated 70% of all harvestable Bangladeshi crops, with an estimated 200,000tonnes (220,000tons) of crops being lost. Widespread power outages cut telecommunications across Bangladesh; in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital city, debris-laden streets paralyzed traffic while electrical outages caused water shortages.|$|E
5|$|The {{worst of}} the damage {{occurred}} {{on the island of}} Yap. Initially, the typhoon was expected to pass north of the island without affecting it significantly, but instead the island experienced the <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm. Typhoon Lupit affected the island in the previous year, from which the islanders were still recovering. With the last minute change in direction, government officials rushed to complete preparations on the island. On the day before the typhoon struck, storm shelters were opened in schools and government buildings that could withstand the winds of Sudal. In anticipation of significant damage, Yap officials sent a request to the FSM government for emergency aid to clean up after the storm.|$|E
