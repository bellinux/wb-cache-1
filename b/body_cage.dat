5000|$|The Exora has an {{equivalent}} 4-star EuroNCAP rating after 32 Exoras were crashed at the Applus+ IDIADA crash testing facility in Spain. Additionally, the Exora {{was awarded a}} 4-star rating by Malaysia's own MyVAP evaluation program. The Exora was given a four-star ANCAP safety rating, applicable to all variants. The MPV, which is [...] with dual frontal and side airbags with thorax and head protection for front occupants, scored 26.37 {{out of a possible}} 37 points. In the offset crash test, the Exora scored 10.55 out of 16 points - driver chest protection was acceptable and leg protection was marginal. In the side impact crash test, it managed 14.82 out of 16 points - driver chest protection was listed as acceptable. The Exora result - with testing carried out in July 2013 - reflected its performance in the 40% frontal offset test, where the risk of serious injury to the driver’s legs was high. Side impact performance was good, but overall pedestrian test results were poor, according to ANCAP. One of the key features that made these ratings possible is the use of high tensile steel for the <b>body</b> <b>cage,</b> providing better stability and increased impact absorption during a collision. Side impact bars are also installed to reinforce the door frames and to absorb impacts from both sides.|$|E
40|$|Study design: Case {{report and}} {{relevant}} literature review. Objective: To discuss {{the management of}} severe flexion-distraction injury of the subaxial cervical spine in a multisystem trauma patient. Summary of background data: Traumatic cervical spine injury from flexion-distraction injury can cause significant instability requiring extensive instrumentation complicated by vascular and soft tissue injuries. Methods: The medical record of a patient who suffered traumatic flexion-distraction injury was reviewed for relevant clinical and radiology data. A literature review on the management of traumatic cervical injuries was performed using the PubMed database. Results: We report a case of 21 -year-old woman who suffered a C 5 -C 6 flexion-distraction injury. After she underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), her care {{was transferred to the}} senior author (S. K.) due to the severity of the distraction. The patient returned to the OR the next day and underwent removal of implants at C 5 and corpectomy with anterior and posterior instrumentation. Conclusion: There are many ways to manage a flexion-distraction injury of the cervical spine. In a polytrauma patient, the surgical strategy can become complex. We present a surgical option with an acceptable outcome.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Anterior {{approach}} indications in unstable thoracolumbar fractures (UTLF) are debated. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the results of anterior fixation and expandable prosthetic vertebral <b>body</b> <b>cage</b> (EPVBC) implantation alone or combined with a posterior approach in the management of UTLF. ăMATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients underwent anterior fixation with implantation of an EPVBC for UTLF from T 7 to L 5. Long-term kyphosis and vertebral height loss reduction, functional outcomes including visual analogical scale and Oswestry disability index were evaluated. ăRESULTS: Anterior fixation led to a significant increase of vertebral body height with a gain of 13 % after a previous posterior approach, 38 % after a single anterior approach and 65 % after combined posterior and anterior approaches (P= 0. 0001). However, anterior fixation did not significantly enhance the vertebral regional kyphosis angle (P= 0. 08), except in cases of single anterior approach for thoracic fractures (P= 0. 03). No significant difference was found between early, 3 months and 1 year postoperative vertebral regional kyphosis angle and vertebral body height (P= 0. 6). Complete fusion was routinely observed at 1 year postoperatively. rhBMP 2 implantation in selected cases appears to be a safe and reliable strategy. No infections or surgical revisions were observed after the anterior approach. ăCONCLUSION: Anterior approach and EPVBC implantation, in UTLF, is a safe and effective procedure, providing long-term vertebral body height and kyphosis correction. Adverse effects of anterior approach remain acceptable. Single anterior fixation is a reliable surgical alternative in thoracic fractures without posterior spine segment injury or spinal cord compression. These results prompted us to extend anterior approach indications in oncology and infectious diseases...|$|E

50|$|If {{a charge}} is placed inside an {{ungrounded}} Faraday cage, the internal {{face of the}} cage becomes charged (in the same manner described for an external charge) to prevent {{the existence of a}} field inside the <b>body</b> of the <b>cage,</b> however, this charging of the inner face re-distributes the charges in the <b>body</b> of the <b>cage.</b> This charges the outer face of the cage with a charge equal in sign and magnitude to the one placed inside the cage.

40|$|Abstract: Twenty-seven {{indigenous}} fowls naturally {{infested with}} fleas {{were used for}} the study. They were allotted into three treatment groups in a completely randomized design of nine birds per treatment and three birds per replicate for each treatment groups. The enumeration of fleas on the body of birds was by the visual area count methodology. The percentage efficacy for treatment groups 1 and 2 were: 98. 08; 95. 53 while for the untreated control group 3, percentage efficacy was not applicable. However for the environment count in cages, th geometric mean number of fleas by the 35 day was 53. 28; 14. 46 and 1. 25 for treatment groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. This result showed that in treatment 1, the test group, mean flea count decreased from the body of the animals as the days progressed but increased on the test leaves placed within the cages. This suggest a possible migration of the fleas from the birds to the cages unlike in the flumethrin control group where flea count decreased in both the cages {{as well as in the}} body of birds and increased in both the <b>body</b> and <b>cages</b> in the untreated control groups. It can therefore be concluded that ficus exasperate leaves can reasonably serve for the control of fleas in <b>cages</b> and <b>body</b> of fowls if test leaves are replaced often.

40|$|There is {{experimental}} evidence {{indicating that the}} noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK- 801 impairs cognition and produces a series of schizophrenia-like symptoms in rodents (hypermotility, stereotypies, and ataxia). The present {{study was designed to}} investigate the efficacy of the nitric oxide (NO) donor molsidomine in counteracting these MK- 801 -induced behavioral effects in the rat. In a first study, post-training administration of molsidomine (at 4 but not 2 mg/kg) successfully antagonized MK- 801 -induced performance deficits in a recognition memory test. In a subsequent study, molsidomine (2 and 4 mg/kg) was shown to be unable to reverse MK- 801 -induced hypermotility but attenuated stereotypies (continuous movement whole <b>cage,</b> <b>body</b> sway, and head weaving) produced by MK- 801.

40|$|Surgical {{treatment}} of the cervico-thoracic junction (CTJ) in the spine require special evaluation due to the anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of this spinal section. The transitional zone between the mobile cervical and the relatively rigid thoracic spine can {{be the site of}} serious unstable traumas or neoplastic lesions. Frequently, injury is associated with neurological impairment due to the small caliber of the spinal canal and/or spinal cord vascular insufficiency. The authors considered 33 neurologic lesions of the CTJ (21 traumas, 10 tumors, 2 infections) treated by means of decompression, fixation, and fusion by different type of instrumentation. Surgical procedure was posterior in 26 cases, anterior in 1 and combined in 6. Major general complications were not found in patients undergoing anterior approach. Biomechanical failure was found in two patients operated by T 1 body replacement and C 7 -T 2 anterior plate. Serious cardio-respiratory complications were related to 2 polytrauma patients who underwent posterior surgery. Follow-up evaluation showed spinal stability and fusion in 88 % of cases, improvement of the neurological deficits in 42 % (19 % improved to ASIA E), no or only occasional pain in 75 % of patients. In the experience, recovery of spinal realignment and stability is essential to avoid disability due to back pain in trauma patients. In spinal tumors, back pain was related to local recurrence. Neurological outcomes can be unsatisfactory due to the initial serious impairment. There is no type of instrumentation more effective than other. In each single lesion, the most suitable type of instrumentation should be employed, considering morphology, biomechanics, and familiarity of the spinal surgeon with different implants and constructs.
