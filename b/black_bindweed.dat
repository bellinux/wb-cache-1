40|$|Introduction: Polygonum {{convolvulus}} L. (<b>black</b> <b>bindweed),</b> syn. Fallopia convolvulus (L.) Á. Löve, Polygonaceae {{family is}} a plant from the spontaneous flora, spread from the plain zone up to the subalpine zone. The objectives of our researches are the qualitative and quantitative determination of polyphenolic compounds from Polygoni convolvuli herba and {{the choice of the}} adequate solvent for obtaining an active pharmacological extract...|$|E
40|$|The plant {{protection}} service of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg conducted from 2010 – 2013 a field trial program on different locations for the development and evaluation of chemical weed control methods in soybean. In this trails the use of herbicides enabled a yield of + 4 dt*ha- 1 respectively 118 % in comparison to untreated control. The selectivity of herbicide applications was uncomplicated except for treatments with inclusion of Pendimethalin. Cleavers (Galium aparine) and <b>black</b> <b>bindweed</b> (Polygonum convolvulus) were harder to control than other common weeds. Cockspur grass (Echinochloa crus-galli) was also insufficient controlled, {{but there was no}} addition use of specific grass weed herbicides in the application programs. The total weed control efficacy for all treatments was proved in a range of 84 - 97 %. Fat-hen (Chenopodium album) as the most important weed in soybean could be controlled by specific herbicide treatments in a range of 83 - 99 %. For integrated weed management it is necessary to consider the site specific weed spectrum, herbicide specific efficacy and the amount in respect to the local soil and weather conditions. As a result of the trials it was possible to authorize the minor use of three further herbicides in soybeans. In consequence there is a comfortable variety of different herbicides in soybean available...|$|E
40|$|In dryland cotton {{cropping}} systems, {{the main}} weeds {{and effectiveness of}} management practices were identified, and {{the economic impact of}} weeds was estimated using information collected in a postal and a field survey of Southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. Forty-eight completed questionnaires were returned, and 32 paddocks were monitored in early and late summer for weed species and density. The main problem weeds were bladder ketmia (Hibiscus trionum), common sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus), barnyard grasses (Echinochloa spp.), liverseed grass (Urochloa panicoides) and <b>black</b> <b>bindweed</b> (Fallopia convolvulus), but the relative importance of these differed with crops, fallows and crop rotations. The weed flora was diverse with 54 genera identified in the field survey. Control of weed growth in rotational crops and fallows depended largely on herbicides, particularly glyphosate in fallow and atrazine in sorghum, although effective control was not consistently achieved. Weed control in dryland cotton involved numerous combinations of selective herbicides, several non-selective herbicides, inter-row cultivation and some manual chipping. Despite this, residual weeds were found at 38 - 59 % of initial densities in about 3 -quarters of the survey paddocks. The on-farm financial costs of weeds ranged from $ 148 to 224 /ha. year depending on the rotation, resulting in an estimated annual economic cost of $ 19. 6 million. The approach of managing weed populations across the whole cropping system needs wider adoption to reduce the weed pressure in dryland cotton and the economic impact of weeds in the long term. Strategies that optimise herbicide performance and minimise return of weed seed to the soil are needed. Data from the surveys provide direction for research to improve weed management in this cropping system. The economic framework provides a valuable measure of evaluating likely future returns from technologies or weed management improvements...|$|E
