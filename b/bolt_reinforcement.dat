40|$|Rock bolting {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} and economical means of rock mass reinforcement. Existing studies of rock <b>bolt</b> <b>reinforcement</b> are mostly focused on rock masses without flaw, with a single flaw, or with parallel flaws. However in rock masses, cracks or flaws usually exist in the form of cross-flaws. In order to understand the impact of cross-flaws on rock <b>bolt</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and to further explore the differences of <b>bolt</b> <b>reinforcement</b> between rock mass with cross-flaws and rock mass with a single flaw, reinforced analog specimens with cross-flaws and with a single flaw were tested under uniaxial compressive condition. The experimental results show that the uniaxial compressive strength of the reinforced rock mass with cross-flaws in this research is higher than that of reinforced rock mass with a single flaw. This observation can be explained by the difference in the failure modes of reinforced specimens: the reinforced rock masses with a single flaw fail due to the formation of a shear crack while reinforced rock masses with cross-flaws fail as a result of a tensile fracture or interaction between tensile fracture and shear fracture.

40|$|Abstract: Most rock related {{fatalities}} {{and injuries}} in South African gold mines {{occur in the}} stope face area. These mines generally do not use rockbolts to support this area. This paper describes short rockbolt applications in the stope face area in a narrow tabular ultradeep Carbon Leader stope. The project began with the geotechnical definition of the generic Carbon Leader Reef hangingwall and {{the design of a}} short rockbolt support system to stabilise this hangingwall. In the paper the implementation efficiency of the bolting system is described. The quantification of ground conditions was undertaken by comparing bolted and unbolted portions of the stope face.

40|$|The truss <b>bolt</b> <b>reinforcement</b> {{system has}} been used in {{controlling}} the stability of underground excavations in severe ground conditions and cutter roof failure in layered rocks especially in coal mines. In spite of good application reports, working mechanism of this system is largely unknown and truss bolts are predominantly designed based on past experience and engineering judgement. In this study, the reinforcing effect of the truss bolt system on an underground excavation in layered rock is studied using non-linear finite element analysis. Different indicators are defined to evaluate the reinforcing effects of the truss bolt system. Using these indicators one can evaluate the effects of a reinforcing system on the deformation, loosened area, failure prevention, horizontal movement of the immediate layer, shear crack propagation and cutter roof failure of underground excavations. Effects of truss bolt on these indicators reveal the working mechanism of the truss bolt system. To illustrate the application of these indicators, a comparative study is conducted between three different truss bolt designs. It is shown that the design parameters of truss bolt systems, including tie-rod span, length, and angle of the bolts can have significant effects on the reinforcing capability of the system. ...|$|E

It is the theory of structural reliability which determines probability of keeping required properties of constructions. Using this theory, {{it is possible to}} apply probabilistic computations based on the probability theory and mathematic statistics. Development of those methods has become more and more popular; it is used, in particular, in designs of load-carrying structures with the required level or reliability when at least some input variables in the design are random. The objective {{of this paper is to}} indicate the current scope which might be covered by the new method—Direct Optimized Probabilistic Calculation (DOProC) in assessments of reliability of load-carrying structures.

40|$|The use of rock <b>bolts</b> as rock <b>reinforcement</b> is {{becoming}} more popular in Malaysia.

This paper highlights a laboratory investigation on the reinforcement mechanisms of rock bolts, specifically on bolt inclination, anchorage type and level of pre-tension. The investigation was conducted using a physical model of a rock bolt intersecting a joint plane. Results obtained show that a better reinforcement can be obtained if bolt is inclined at an angle to the joint plane so that it elongates upon joint displacement. Full-bonded bolt is more superior in terms of mobilising the anchorage capacity and consequently, this allows for immediate utilisation of the reinforcing element. Pre-tensioning of bolt induces clamping effect on joint surface consequently, helps to reduce joint dilatation and increases the inherent shear strength of the joint...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis has been concerned with investigation of the geomechanical behaviour of laminated weak roof strata along longwall roadways in underground coal mines and the mechanisms for effective reinforcement. Field investigations have been particularly associated with underground conditions at Angus Place Colliery, New South Wales, Australia. The principal objectives of this investigation are to understand the deformation behaviour of the laminated weak roof strata and the roof reinforcement problems which have plagued longwall roadway support and underground mining in West Coalfield of New South Wales. Based on the comprehensive engineering understanding of the geomechanical behaviour of laminated weak roof strata, an appropriate reinforcement strategy is developed. The thesis consists of four major parts associated with different approaches adopted in conducting the investigation, including: 1. Laboratory investigation: Conventional deformation and strength parameters of major roof rocks, such as, coal, mudstone and sandstone, including modulus of elasticity, uniaxial compressive strength, (UCS), uniaxial tensile strength, cohesion and angle of internal friction, along with shear strength, triaxial compressive strength with different confinements, have been conducted, {{in order to determine}} the mechanical properties of roof rock masses. On the other hand, a series of tests has been conducted to investigate the water sensitivity of mechanical properties of roof rocks, in order to evaluate the effect of water on mechanical properties of roof rocks and to determine the deterioration mechanism of roof rock. According to the results, the intact roof rocks can be classified from medium strong to weak rock mass subjected to the 0 % water content. When the water content and discontinuity have been taken into consideration, the roof and floor strata in maingate 22, Angus Place Colliery can be classified as a weak strata. In general, the mechanical properties of surrounding rock masses, the integrity of roof and floor structures are significantly influenced by discontinuity and water. 2. Mine site investigation: The major purposes of this work are to determine the detailed roof deformation behaviour and roof layer separation in the roof strata and the performance of rock <b>bolting</b> <b>reinforcement</b> system used in longwall roadway by using the wire and sonic extensometers and instrumented bolts. According to this work, the roof deformation is differentiated into three different stages associated with different mining activities, that is: a) stage of development, b) stage of time dependent deformation (after development and before extraction) and c) stage of extraction. On the other hand, the deformation behaviour at different horizons associated with different roof geological settings is also determined. Correspondingly, the rock bolting performance is monitored including the maximum axial load, the distribution of load along the length of bolt, the bending moment of bolts as well as the load variation with different stages during the mining. 3. Parametric study: The parametric study is conducted by two and three dimensional computer modelling using Map 3 D and Phase 2. Three dimensional modelling determines the stress redistribution and deformation around opening after roadway development and during the longwall extraction, which provides basic stress parameters as reference for the two dimensional modelling. In two dimensional modelling, the comprehensive parametric study on rock <b>bolting</b> <b>reinforcement</b> system and grouting reinforcement has been conducted. It is noted that the roof stability can be improved through three different ways, which are: a) optimising combination of rock bolting parameters, such as, bolt length, pretension, inclination, stiffness, distribution, etc, b) using combined reinforcement methods, such as, rock <b>bolting</b> and grouting <b>reinforcements,</b> c) altering geometry of opening, particularly for the rectangular shape of opening. 4. Theoretical analyses: The principles of material and structural mechanics have been used and based on these mechanical theories, the roof deformation mechanisms have been developed associated with different stages of mining activities. Based on the outcomes of the study, the reinforcement strategy has been developed using three approaches, including, a) the features of underground geological and geomechanical conditions and deformation behaviour of opening, b) the reinforcement methods and parameters, and c) Principles of New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM). Also, the procedure for development of reinforcement strategy has been proposed which can be used as a guide for evaluating the deformation behaviour and developing the reinforcement strategy under different adverse ground conditions...|$|R

Further to safety concerns, {{in the event of}} failure, profitability may reduce significantly because of loss of time and dilution of the ore, raising the importance of support and reinforcement design in underground excavations both in civil and mining engineering. The truss <b>bolt</b> <b>reinforcement</b> system has been used in controlling the stability {{of underground}} excavations in severe ground conditions and preventing cutter roof failure in layered rocks especially in coal mines. In spite of good application reports, working mechanism of this system is largely unknown and truss bolts are predominantly designed based on past experience and engineering judgement. In this study, the reinforcing effect of the truss bolt system on an underground excavation in layered rock is studied using non-linear finite element analysis and software package ABAQUS. The behaviour of the rock after installing reinforcement needs to be measured via defining some performance indicators. These indicators would be able to evaluate the effects of a reinforcing system on deformations, loosened area above the roof, failure prevention, horizontal movement of the immediate layer, shear crack propagation, and cutter roof failure of underground excavations. To understand the mechanism of truss bolt system, a comparative study is conducted between three different truss bolt designs. Effects of several design parameters on the performance of the truss bolt are studied. Also, a comparison between the effects of truss bolt and systematic rock bolt on different stability indicators is made to highlight the different mechanism of these two systems. In practice, site conditions {{play a vital role in}} achieving an optimum design for the reinforcement system. To study the effects of position of the bedding planes and thickness of the rock layers, several model configurations have been simulated.

Unfavourable mining, {{geotechnical}} conditions at large depths and the ban by Czech mining authorities prevented this method from being used on rock <b>bolt</b> <b>reinforcement</b> without other roof support. Typically, large amounts of unexploited coal reserves are left in the shaft protective pillars. This coal can be mined if strata subsidence is minimised. Due to its low subsidence characteristics {{the room and}} pillar mining method without pillar extraction has been trialled at the CSM Coal Mine at the end of 2014. During the pillar development phase complex geotechnical monitoring was undertaken including the frequent scanning of pillar movement using 3 D laser scanning technology. The laser scanner enabled complex capture of the entire space around the monitored pillars during the period of pillar formation and afterwards. The time-lapse scanning method measured changes in the mine roadway surface profiles including pillar displacements, roof movements, floor heave and other dynamic phenomena. The time-lapse scanning indicated variable pillar rib movement ranging from a few cm to a maximum of 50 cm with an average of approximately 25 to 30 cm. The scans indicated that the bottom of the seam displaced more than the top of the rib side due to large floor heave. The weak floor consisting of siltstone and coal beds experienced large floor heave however, due to floor brushing no reliable floor displacements are available. In contrast to the large movements in the rib and the floor, the strong roof strata did not show any significant movements. The purpose of this work is to highlight the importance of terrestrial laser scanning as an essential engineering design tool to evaluate the displacements and deformations of mine excavations at large depths. The 3 D scanning results gave relevant information about displacements and deformations that occurred at the tested site and thereby helped to improve safety underground...|$|E

The use of shear reinforcement {{in the form of}} Shear Bolts is a new approach to strengthening slab-column connections. Reported in this thesis are the results of research on the use of shear bolts for reinforced concrete interior slab-column connections without unbalanced moments. Six slab specimens were tested with different configurations of shear bolts and without shear reinforcement to verify the effectiveness of this method of reinforcement. The central idea is an externally applied shear reinforcing technique that provides strength in shear at par with other conventional reinforcement types {{on the one hand and}} offering the distinct advantage and flexibility of external application after construction. A shear bolt consists of an unhardened steel shaft threaded at one end and flared out to form a bearing/anchor surface on the other end. All six specimens were designed to fail in shear before reaching their flexural capacity, two of which were more critical than the others because of the presence of openings simulating utility ducts around the column perimeter. From the tests, comparisons of predicted loads with the failure loads indicated a higher ultimate load for slab reinforced with the bolt system. Similarly, strain measurements from strain gauges attached to the longitudinal steel and deflection profiles of the slab showed that the new method was efficient in increasing the shear capacity of the slabs. In summary, the test program showed that shear bolts are effective in transforming the behaviour of the slab-column connections from a brittle punching shear failure mode to a more ductile flexural one. Deflection profiles at different load stages, and particularly at failure, show increased deflections for specimens reinforced with <b>bolt</b> <b>reinforcements.</b> This indicates an increased ductility at the connection.

The cases include five failures where major rock falls occurred in front of the shields, and six even more serious failures involving major overburden weighting. This suggests two room failure mechanisms The first is a roof fall type failure caused by loading of the immediate roof at the face as the fender narrows.

40|$|Accelerated bridge {{construction}} has quickly become the preferred method for the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) {{as well as}} many other DOT’s across the United States. This type of construction requires the use of full depth precast panels for the construction of the bridge deck. The segmented deck panels produce transverse joints between panels and have {{come to be known as}} the weakest portion of the deck. Cracking often occurs at these joints and is reflected through the deck overlay where water accesses and begins corrosion of the reinforcement and superstructure below. For this reason post-tensioning of the deck panels is becoming a regular practice to ensure that the deck behaves more monolithically, limiting cracking. The current post-tensioning used by UDOT inhibits future replacement of single deck panels and requires that all panels be replaced once one panel is deemed defective. The new curved bolt connection provides the necessary compressive stresses across the transverse joints but makes future replacement of a single deck panel possible without replacing the entire bridge deck. To better understand the behavior of the new curved bolt connection under loadings, laboratory testing was undertaken on both the curved bolt and the current post-tensioning used by UDOT. The testing specimens included full-scale, full-depth, precast panels that were connected using both system. The testing induced typical stresses on the panels and connections, subjecting them to negative bending and shear. The overall performance of the curved bolt proved satisfactory. The moment capacity of both connections surpassed all theoretical calculations. The yield and plastic moments were 17 % and 16 % lower, respectively, than the UDOT post-tension system while at those moments deflection was relatively the same. Due to the anchorage location of the curved <b>bolts,</b> the <b>reinforcement</b> around the transverse joint received up to 5 times the strain of that of the post-tension connections.

This hypothesis is presented in graphical form. Of particular interest was the effect of loading on trusses installed to augment the vertical rock bolts and wire mesh typically installed in backfill. Data from the instruments indicate that wall closure perpendicular to the vein induced loads in truss legs parallel to the vein and in the rock bolt driven {{through the center of the}} truss, but, because they are designed to function under tension, truss legs perpendicular to the vein supplied in significant support as a result of compressional forces from wall closure. Based on this study, use of trusses was discontinued, and an alternative support system of wood beams and posts was installed as needed to ensure the safety of miners working beneath the backfill in stope-ramp intersections...|$|R
40|$|When {{considering}} the degradation process and lifetime {{of the support}} system and equipment in underground facilities, the selection of materials is (normally) based on established criteria for the chemical composition of the groundwater. This is important for decisions regarding the steel quality and protection of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bolts,</b> {{as well as the}} material used for the waterproofing system and lining. The criteria are imposed through groundwater sampling and analysis of groundwater prior to the construction of an underground facility. However, studies of the impact on groundwater chemistry from the construction of underground structures and experiments with groundwater extraction indicate that the groundwater chemistry is likely to change over time. Underground facilities are known to cause hydrological changes, especially during the construction phase. However, extensive monitoring programmes of groundwater chemistry are unusual. To further investigate possible changes of water chemistry due to hydrological changes, an experiment with groundwater extraction has been carried out. The experiment was conducted through the constant extraction of groundwater for a period of five years (between the years 2000 and 2005) from within a small watershed (28000 m 2) at Lake Gårdsjön, located 50 km north of Gothenburg in Sweden. The area was also monitored during a few years before the extraction started and during the recovery phase. The area of the experiment is characterized by Precambrian crystalline bedrock covered by a thin overburden of glacial till and organic soils. The extraction caused the runoff from the watershed to decrease by nearly 50 % and the groundwater level to fluctuate more than at a nearby reference area. The hydrological impact of the experiment, with increased groundwater recharge, lead to changes and increased seasonal variations in the chemical composition of the groundwater in the bedrock. The hydrochemical variations were caused by seasonal variations in both the amount of water available for groundwater recharge and the chemical composition of the recharging water. Compared to the reference area, the seasonal variations were observed to increase for all the parameters included in the criteria used by the Swedish authorities for selection of construction materials (pH, hardness (Ca), alkalinity, salinity (EC)). An established method {{to assess the impact of}} the water composition on the corrosion of steel materials is the use of Langeliers index. The experiment with groundwater extraction caused a larger fluctuation of Langeliers index in the test area compared to the reference area. The results from the experiment confirm the observations from previous tunnelling projects, and show that the methods commonly used to assess the expected future aggressivity of the groundwater in the planning for underground facilities should be reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Rock bolts {{are used}} as {{temporary}} and permanent support systems in tunnelling and mining operations. In surface mining they are used for slope stability operations and in underground workings to develop roadway, sink shafts, and stoping operations. Rock bolting technology has developed rapidly {{over the past three}} decades due to a better understanding of load transfer mechanisms and advances made in the bolt system technology. Bolts are placed into discontinuous rock to prevent movement between the discontinuity planes, depending on the direction of installation and nature of the discontinuity surfaces. Rock bolting can increase the tension and shear properties of the rock mass. Nowadays, the application of rock <b>bolts</b> for ground <b>reinforcement</b> and stabilisation is worldwide, but its effectiveness depends on rock type, strata lithology, and encapsulation characteristics. Thus the bolt, rock interaction, particularly near the shear joints, and how a bolt reacts to surrounding conditions require continuous evaluation and research. Work provides an in depth study of the bolt, grout, concrete interaction during under axial and lateral loading. To better understand load transfer characterisation bolt shearing across joint and planes, this research programme consists of three parts. Accordingly, a series of experimental studies and field work was undertaken. A numerical technique was developed to obtain the stress and strain developed along the bolt and surrounding materials under axial and lateral loading. Finally, a field investigation programme was undertaken to obtain the load developed along different bolt profiles (another objective of this thesis). Bolt profiles were also investigated by laboratory studies. A double shearing system (DSS) was used to examine bolts shearing. Testing was undertaken in 20, 40, and 100 MPa strength concrete to simulate different rock strengths. Only three bolt types were used in axial loading tests and different thicknesses of resin were evaluated under axial and lateral loading. Tests subjected to lateral loading were undertaken in 0, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 80 kN pre-tension loads, which revealed that the strength of the concrete significantly affects the bolt – joint contribution. Also shear displacement was dramatically reduced when the strength of the concrete was increased. Pre-tension increases the shear resistance of the system. The profile of a rock bolt affects the shear performance and load transfer under axial and lateral loads. The 3 -D FE code, ANSYS V. 9. 1 was used. To investigate the load transfer and interaction between bolt, grout, and concrete under non-linear conditions, special element types for the materials and contact interfaces were introduced. The stress and strain built up along the materials under axial and lateral loads was examined. A laboratory study on shearing at the bolt, resin interface of fully grouted bolts was extended to field studies in Appin and Metropolitan Collieries in the Southern Coalfields of the Sydney Basin, NSW, Australia. Twelve instrumented bolts were installed at both mines. Both installation sites were in the heading of a retreating long wall mine. The field investigation revealed that the load transfer on a bolt is affected by horizontal in-situ stresses and profile of the bolt surface. It showed that bolt with higher ribs and wider spacing offered greater shear resistance at the bolt – resin interface, which agreed with the laboratory results...|$|R
