40|$|AbstractThe laser brazing {{of steel}} sheets is widely applied in car-body manufacturing. The {{critical}} {{value for the}} strength of the joint is the minimal connection width between the two sheets. However, this value is depending on the feed rate and power of the laser and the feed rate and preheating current of the filler wire used. Furthermore, the wetting behavior of the <b>brazing</b> <b>solder</b> is affected by the surface properties of the joining partners and is thus prone to errors. Currently, mostly destructive testing is used to evaluate the connection state. Therefore, we studied a novel optical measurement technique which is capable of remotely measuring oscillations of the joining partners. In the proposed study, we show how the oscillations are connected to the process behavior and the fusion area and how the setup might be applied as a post- and in-process measurement system...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{properties}} of Si 3 N 4 substrate material with AMB (active metal brazing) copper conductor. A recently developed type of tape casted, gas pressure sintered silicon nitride ceramic with a three times higher thermal conductivity than known from typical standard silicon nitride materials and with good flexural strength was applied. The increase of thermal conductivity {{is the result of}} using different species of sintering aids and the optimization of their ratio in the material. The high bending strength allows creating a thinner substrate compared to other standard ceramic materials for power electronics, e. g. aluminum nitride. This reduction in thickness leads to a decrease of the total thermal resistance of the substrate which improves heat dissipation. For the AMB process a silver based active <b>brazing</b> <b>solder</b> composition optimized for Silicon Nitride was used. This optimization could be obtained by an investigation of the physical and chemical interactions between the brazing and the base material. A void free joint without short circuits between adjacent structures could be formed. The copper surface can be coated on demand with Nickel or Nickel/Gold for improved solderability and wire bondability as well as for corrosion protection. The silicon nitride substrate with AMB copper conductor lines and fully covered back side ground shows a higher reliability than comparable substrates made out of common, well known ceramic materials. The heat dissipation is comparable with conventional AMB substrates made of high thermal conductive ceramic such as Aluminum Nitride, but thermal cycling behavior exceeds the limits well known from AlN-AMB or AlN-DCB...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{variety of}} {{industrial}} use of <b>brazing</b> <b>solders</b> is associated {{in one way}} with plastic properties (more plastic materials are producing {{in the form of}} wires, sheets, bands, metal leafs, meshes etc, low plastic materials in the form: pig sows, bars, powders) and in another way with the kind of joining and use <b>soldering</b> or <b>brazing</b> method. Hard <b>solders,</b> which include analyzed solder BAg 7, have a very wide range of melting points (from 400 to 2000 ºC) and are applied in those cases when very high values of strength are required for soldered joint. The research was carried out for the silver-based solder designated as Bag 7 according to American Standard ANSI/AWSA 5. 8 - 92. This solder has a typical application for the brazing process of food handling equipment requiring low melting values and for brazing aluminium alloys. In the literature, except for chemical composition and temperature of brazing, we cannot find the details concerned with the method of plastic working of BAg 7. In the reported research work the metallographic analysis of rolling process was performed and optimal parameters of rolling process for the considered solder were determined...|$|R
50|$|Welders are {{commonly}} {{exposed to the}} substances that cause metal fume fever from the base metal, plating, or filler. <b>Brazing</b> and <b>soldering</b> can also cause metal poisoning due to exposure to lead, zinc, copper, or cadmium.

40|$|The flow {{behavior}} of liquid metals at solid interfaces {{is critically important}} to successful welding, <b>brazing,</b> <b>soldering</b> and the synthesis of metal/ceramic composites. Continuum flow models frequently fail to reliably predict wetting behavior because they are based upon bulk fluid properties, rather than microscopic flow processes at the actual solid/liquid interface. Improved understanding of interfacial liquid flow is hindered by the paucity of experimental measurements at this microscopic level. This report describes a new approach, Acoustic Wave Damping (AWD), to measuring viscoelastic properties of liquid metal layers in the nanometer thickness regime. The AWD experiment measures the frequency response of a quartz crystal microbalance in contact with an viscoelastic layer. An equivalent circuit model and continuum acoustic theory relate this electrical response to mechanical energy storage and dissipative loss.

40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of new technologies of metal joining processes including brazing methods requires improvement of <b>solder</b> properties. Copper-based <b>brazing</b> <b>solders</b> with phosphorus and tin additions belong {{to the group of}} silver-free brazing alloys with low ductility. The most common form of these solders are bars and wires so {{there is a need to}} determine the causes of technological problems concerned with plastic deformation of the solders. In the literature, except for the chemical composition and temperature of brazing, we can not find the details regarding the change of solder structure during heating processes. The preliminary tests carried out in the industry indicate high plasticity of solder in the narrow range of temperature. This encouraged the authors of the paper to perform dilatometric testing with the aim of establishing the precise temperatures of solder phase changes. The metallographic research with the use of scanning electron microscopy enabled the determination of phase composition of “freezing ” structures and the evaluation of their flexibility to the plastic deformation...|$|R
50|$|Another {{difference}} between <b>brazing</b> and <b>soldering</b> {{is how the}} solder is applied. In brazing, one generally uses rods that are touched to the joint while being heated.

40|$|AbstractAlthough it was {{developed}} primarily as a method to produce integral thick preforms for composites, 3 D weaving provides an intriguing industrial scale manufacturing path to form cellular metal materials. In typical composites applications, development focused on increasing the volume fraction of fibers (yarns) within the preform. To produce effective cellular materials instead, research must focus on how to create open space within the woven structure. As a demonstration of this manufacturing path, small Cu wires, and then NiCr wires, were woven into several materials with various internal architectures using a non-crimp 3 D orthogonal weaving machine. Initially, techniques were developed to weave the individual metal wires with precise placement and minimal twisting. These techniques were then used to create several different 3 D woven material architectures with regular interconnected internal open space. Subsequent processes, such as <b>brazing,</b> <b>soldering,</b> and electroplating {{would be used to}} bond the nodes where the wires contact each other. In this set of experiments, the materials were 30 mm wide, 3 - 4 mm thick and on the order of a meter long.

40|$|In modern joining technology, {{the focus}} is on {{effective}} <b>brazing</b> and <b>soldering</b> of temperature sensitive materials. Here, as well as in diffusion welding processes the needed thermal energy is externally realized in the joint zone. This produces a heating of the whole joining parts, since in laminar joining the thermal energy is transported in interior by thermal conduction. An excess of critical temperatures or tolerable impact periods in wide parts of materials and respectively components is often not avoidable. This leads to thermal damages. In this point of view nanotechnology shows promising possibilities as scale effects and their resulting thermophysical effects such as melting temperature reduction and high diffusion rates can be used for providing a self-propagating high-temperature synthesis at room temperature. After ignition by an external energy source a self-propagating exothermic reaction is started. By producing a multilayer system with alternately arranged nanoscaled layers of e. g. Al and Ni the resulting thin foil can be used as heat source for melting the <b>braze</b> or <b>solder</b> material within the joining zone without any external preheating.
