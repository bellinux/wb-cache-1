Critical values of crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) and J-integral were determined at - 10 degrees C {{at the onset}} of stable crack extension, at instability, and at the first attainment of maximum load for the weldmetal of double V- and K-joints, and for the heat affected zone of K-joints, both in the as-welded and post-weld heat treated condition. For single edge notched bend (SENB) and C-specimens CTOD values were calculated following BS 5762 and the ASTM draft standard for CTOD testing, respectively. The J-integral results were obtained from integrating froce/displacement diagrams. The toughness results for the weldmetal and the heat affected zone of the different welds are compared; influenced of specimen geometry, restraint conditions during welding, and post-weld treatment are discussed.

40|$|The {{development}} of precise {{data for the}} effect of chemistry and processing variables on the fracture toughness of low to medium carbon cast steels, is paramount to an increased understanding of the fracture behaviour of these important engineering materials. This knowledge would, in itself, lead to improvements in alloy development/selection rationale and increased cast steel usage, particularly in critical areas. Toward this end, {{an investigation into the}} influence of Cr, Mn and Ni additions on the room temperature fracture toughness and flow properties of 0. 30, 0. 40 and 0. 55 wt% C cast alloys was conducted. In order to avoid the chemical and processing complexity normally associated with commercial castings, the study was undertaken on heavy section castings produced in the laboratory from melts composed of commercial purity ingredients. Measurements were conducted on three-point <b>bend</b> <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> machined from heat-treated castings. The fracture toughness techniques used included LEFM (K(,IC)), J integral and COD ((delta) (,c)). A potential drop method was employed to record crack initiation. Very high room temperature fracture toughnesses were achieved in the majority of the alloys examined, with only three alloys having K(,IC) values of less than 150 MN. m('- 3 / 2) or COD, (delta) (,c), values of less than 0. 1 mm. Further, yield stress ((sigma) (,ys)) values were found to lie within 80 - 105 % of those recorded for commercial castings of comparative composition. At the 0. 30 and 0. 40 wt% C levels {{it was found that the}} room temperature fracture toughness of the alloys was relatively independent of the microstructure as well as the amount and particular addition element employed, although variations in the tensile properties were noted. At the 0. 55 wt% C level significant differences in the fracture behaviour were caused by the individual element additions. Manganese was found to improve the toughness of the high carbon alloys, while nickel produced little change and chromium had a negative effect on toughness. In each case the influence of these elements was manifested in microstructural differences. The results of this study are reviewed in the light of the limited data available from commercial cast steels and the need for improved toughness performance without undue loss of yield strength and other properties....

40|$|Load-extension {{tests on}} flour dough {{are widely used}} by plant breeders, millers and bakers. The 'Kieffer dough and gluten {{extensibility}} rig' is a small-scale version of the Brabender extensograph, in which <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> of about 0. 4 g are extended. With the Kieffer rig, lower strain rates can be applied than in the Brabender extensograph and the experimental data can be {{expressed in terms of}} stress and strain. In this paper the performance of the Kieffer rig is illustrated by measurements on a weak and a strong dough. Formulas are given for the calculation of fundamental rheological parameters from the results of measurements with the Kieffer rig. Sagging and <b>bending</b> of the <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> before measurements could be started, caused difficulties in the determination of the exact starting point of extension. The deformation was not purely uniaxial extension, because a shear component was also observed. The amount of dough that is extended did not increase throughout the test. This is probably due to the occurrence of a shear component fracture which occurred mainly near the hook. A relatively large variation in stress and strain at fracture was observed. The maximum in stress represents the strain at which the sample fractures macroscopically better than the maximum in force. Variation in deformation history and volume of the <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> {{have a negative effect on}} the reproducibility...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} three- and four-point <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> and diametral compression (DC) tests, {{used to measure the}} mechanical strength of green pressed compacts. The study has been conducted on pressed ceramic <b>test</b> <b>pieces,</b> formed at different pressing conditions. It was found that Weibull statistics largely explained the differences in the results of the three-point and four-point <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> However, Weibull statistics could not explain the much lower mechanical strength obtained with the diametral compression tests. The study establishes a correlation between the bending and DC tests; however, this correlation depends on moisture content, which {{is directly related to the}} plasticity of the piece. This finding confirms that the types of mechanical tests studied do not have the same sensitivity to the factors that lead to fracture. The differences in mechanical strength between the <b>bending</b> and DC <b>tests</b> were explained using a suitable fracture criterion (based on maximum strain) and plastic deformation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
