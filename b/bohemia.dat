Béla once again imprisoned his brother, and he also put their mother, Euphrosyne, in confinement. In {{retaliation}} for Soběslav's role in Géza's capture, Emperor Frederick dethroned Soběslav and appointed {{another member of the}} Přemyslid dynasty, Frederick, to the position of duke. The Holy Roman Emperor ordered the new Duke of Austria, Leopold V, to storm <b>Bohemia.</b> Béla soon intervened, threatening Leopold V with an invasion, which forced Leopold to leave <b>Bohemia.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Dean Hall {{produced}} a massively popular mod for ARMA 2 {{that prompted the}} studio to develop a standalone game. The same year saw the arrest of two employees of <b>Bohemia,</b> who were charged with espionage by Greece and jailed for 129 days. This event had significantly lowered team morale and forced the team to rename the ARMA 3s setting to a fictional one. The company is now working on several new projects, including preparing DayZ for an eventual full release and developing Ylands, a sandbox game {{which was part of}} <b>Bohemia</b> Incubator, a platform for <b>Bohemia</b> Interactive to release small, experimental projects.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1335, {{the delegates}} of John of <b>Bohemia</b> {{and the new}} King of Poland, Casimir III, entered into {{negotiations}} in Trencsén {{to put an end}} to the conflicts between the two countries. With Charles's mediation, a compromise was reached on 24August: John of <b>Bohemia</b> renounced his claim to Poland and Casimir of Poland acknowledged John of Bohemia's suzerainty in Silesia. On 3September, Charles signed an alliance with John of <b>Bohemia</b> in Visegrád, which was primarily formed against the Dukes of Austria. Upon Charles's invitation, John of <b>Bohemia</b> and Casimir of Poland met in Visegrád in November. During the Congress of Visegrád, the two rulers confirmed the compromise that their delegates had worked out in Trencsén. CasimirIII also promised to pay 400,000 groschen to John of <b>Bohemia,</b> but a part of this indemnification (120,000 groschen) was finally paid off by Charles instead of his brother-in-law. The three rulers agreed upon a mutual defence union against the Habsburgs, and a new commercial route was set up to enable merchants travelling between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire to bypass Vienna.|$|E
5|$|It is {{only with}} the Peasants' Revolt that Richard starts to emerge clearly in the annals. One of his first {{significant}} acts after the rebellion was to marry Anne of <b>Bohemia,</b> daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor (King of <b>Bohemia</b> Charles IV) and his wife Elisabeth of Pomerania, on 20 January 1382. The marriage had diplomatic significance; in the division of Europe caused by the Western Schism, <b>Bohemia</b> and the Empire were seen as potential allies against France in the ongoing Hundred Years' War. Nonetheless, the marriage was not popular in England. Despite great sums of money awarded to the Empire, the political alliance never resulted in any military victories. Furthermore, the marriage was childless. Anne died from plague in 1394, greatly mourned by her husband.|$|E
