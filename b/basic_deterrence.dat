50|$|A private {{security}} officer's responsibility is protecting their client {{from a variety}} of hazards (usually in the form of criminal acts). Security personnel enforce company rules and can act to protect lives and property, and they often have a contractual obligation to provide these actions. In addition to <b>basic</b> <b>deterrence,</b> security officers are often trained to perform specialized tasks such as arrest and control (including handcuffing and restraints), operate emergency equipment, perform first aid, CPR, take accurate notes, write detailed reports, and perform other tasks as required by the client they are serving. All security officers are also required to go through additional training mandated by the state for the carrying of weapons such as batons, firearms, and pepper spray (e.g. the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services in California has requirements that a license for each item listed must be carried while on duty). Some officers are required to complete police certification for special duties. Virginia training standards for security are identical to police training with regards to firearms (shotgun and handgun) but do not place licensing requirements for other items carried, only that training be provided that is documented. Several security companies have also become certified in RADAR and trained their sworn special police officers to use it on protected properties in conjunction with lights/sirens, allowing them to legally enforce traffic laws on private property.|$|E
40|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>deterrence</b> {{model of}} tax evasion is described, its main {{predictions}} are derived and limitations and flexibility are outlined. Further, {{the model is}} interpreted in light of some key institutional features characterising tax enforcement in OECD countries. Throughout the survey, findings originating from the deterrence model are contrasted with predictions which result from a simple model of criminal activity and law enforcement...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{extends the}} {{economic}} {{literature on the}} enforcement of environmental regulations by empirically analysing the effectiveness of environmental criminal law. It is a shortcoming of the discussion {{on the merits of}} criminal sanctions for environmental offenses that the empirical evidence on their effectiveness has so far not been systematically examined. This contrasts with the case of administrative sanctions for which a rich literature is available. Furthermore and despite the obvious parallels with the types of criminal behaviour studied using the so-called 'economic model of crime', the theoretical and empirical economic literature on crime has also largely by-passed the area of environmental crime. Little is therefore known regarding {{the extent to which the}} 'calculus of deterrence' postulated by Becker is operational in the context of environmental crimes. The thesis consists of four parts. The first part is dedicated to a comprehensive literature review on the empirical evidence of the effectiveness of both administrative sanctions in environmental law and criminal sanctions in general law. The second part then analyses the deterrent hypothesis by means of the German environmental criminal code in a dynamic panel data context. Special attention is given to the problem of potentially substantial dark figures in the context of environmental crime. The results derived add in significant ways to the existing literature. The first new insight is that while a substantial part of the German legal literature characterizes the German environmental criminal code as ineffective and therefore redundant, the results indicate otherwise. While rarely used, enforcement instruments restricted to criminal sanctioning such as trial in a public court and prison rates have a substantial statistical effect on reported environmental crime rates. With a view to validating the economic theory of crime, there is clear evidence that the "calculus of deterrence" is indeed operational in the domain of environmental crime. The second insight is the importance of detection and reporting effort for understanding the variation in reported environmental crime. The third part empirically investigates the most common type of environmental crime in Germany, namely illegal waste disposal. Using panel data at the county level of Baden-Württemberg, this part of the thesis has two primary objectives. First, it provides a verification of the results obtained in part two with respect to the deterrence effects. The second objective is to identify further key factors that influence the amount of environmental crime and that go beyond the <b>basic</b> <b>deterrence</b> framework. Examples include structural, economic and political economy variables. Results are threefold. First, there is clear evidence that the deterrence effects found in the state-wide analysis carry over to the counties of Baden-Württemberg. Especially the fact of being tried in a public court again deters people from committing environmental crimes. Second, the analysis supports previous findings on the importance of structural and economic factors that influence illegal behaviour in general. Third, this part reveals new and more subtle political economy factors that play an important role in this setting. The fourth part of the thesis reverses the focus by testing whether the success of different institutions involved in the enforcement process is subject to political control or public pressure. The extent to which exterior political factors or public preferences influence the behaviour of police, prosecutions or courts is only incompletely examined in the literature. However, this question is of fundamental importance as enforcement institutions jointly determine the effectiveness of every monitoring and enforcement regime. Findings show that economic factors including opportunity cost arguments matter at all stages of enforcement. Moreover, it turns out that political economy variables influence the behaviour of police, prosecution and courts. In contrast to initial hypothesis, the degree of influence remains fairly constant at all stages of enforcement. The present thesis therefore extends both the economic literature on the enforcement of environmental regulations and the general economics of crime literature by empirically analyzing the effectiveness of environmental criminal law. The derived results contribute in a significant way to a better understanding of the functioning of criminal enforcement in the context of environmental law. It is able to close the gap in the existing literature and to provide necessary information for policy-makers in the US, UK and within the European Commission discussing whether to further strengthen or weaken the use of criminal law in this context...|$|E
40|$|The tax {{compliance}} behavioural literature indicates that among other factors, demographic variables {{found in the}} social and psychology models of taxpayer compliance {{play an important role in}} the compliance behaviour of taxpayers. However, in measuring and analysing a deterrent impact the <b>basic</b> economic <b>deterrence</b> model has failed to consider these demographic factors. Consequently, this article critically examines the variables employed in the <b>basic</b> economic <b>deterrence</b> model of taxpayer compliance with respect to the measurement of deterrence and compares this with an examination of the demographic and other variables employed {{in the social and}} psychology models. The recommendation is made that selective demographic and other variables ought to be included in a combined or expanded model in order to best measure deterrence. This will not only ensure how deterrent measures are revealed but more importantly, how taxpayers’ perceptions of deterrent measures are formed...|$|R
30|$|The toolkit of {{security}} management approaches available to humanitarian agencies include three <b>basic</b> strategies—protection, <b>deterrence,</b> and acceptance. Protection refers to hardening the target, which reduces vulnerability {{but does not}} address the threat. 3 It involves reducing exposure, decreasing visibility, and utilising protective devices and procedures, such as walls and barbed wire. This strategy is common in many contexts, and its extreme form {{is often referred to as}} bunkerisation. Isolating an agency’s personnel and materials in compounds with guards, defensive walls and limited access has in fact long been a normal response in many areas of insecurity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This entry {{concerns}} punitive damages. In {{considering the}} rationale for the award of punitive damages, we refer to two broad social goals: deterrence and punishment. In section 2 of the entry, we review the <b>basic</b> theory of <b>deterrence,</b> and in sections 3 through 6, we discuss the main deterrence-related justifications for punitive damages: the possibility of escaping sanctions; underestimation of harm; socially illicit gains; and inducing parties to bargain rather than acting unilaterally to cause harm. Then in section 7 we examine the punishment goal and how it is served by punitive damages, and in section 8 we consider how the punishment and deterrence goals should jointly determine damages. Finally, in section 9 we address a variety of extensions to the analysis and certain legal doctrines that bear on the award of punitive damages. Contribution to: September 199...|$|R
40|$|This master's degree thesis {{deals with}} status quo of Taiwan through {{the scope of}} {{deterrence}} theory. Although China has claimed island as its integral part and {{that it must be}} reunited with mainland China Taiwan is still de facto independent state. Important factor of China-Taiwan relations is US long-term security commitment to the island which creates deterrence triad in which the United States deters China from coercive solution of the Taiwan issue. Through the engagement of <b>basic</b> assumptions of <b>deterrence</b> theory and its modalities including conventional deterrence theory and concept of strategic ambiguity I try to theoretically evaluate US deterrence credibility. According to theory and its modalities the deterrence is credible only when the US is perceived as resolved to execute the threat; when defending Taiwan is perceived as US vital interest; and when the US possesses sufficient capabilities for executing the threat. Based on analysis I claim that the US deterrence of China from attacking Taiwan needs to be considered as credible. However, due to Chinese military modernization and development of new military technologies the US deterrence credibility concerning Taiwan is at stake. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R
40|$|This study {{advances}} four propositions on {{the role}} of nuclear weapons in national security in the twenty-first century strategic environment. First, the primary role of nuclear weapons now and in the foreseeable future is <b>basic</b> or central <b>deterrence.</b> Nuclear weapons also prevent blackmail, preserve strategic autonomy (freedom to act), and provide insurance to cope with unanticipated developments in a changing strategic environment. Second, although deterrence continues to be the dominant role and strategy for the employment of nuclear weapons, the conception and practice of deterrence is different from the mutual assured destruction condition that characterized the Soviet-American nuclear confrontation during the Cold War and varies across countries. Deterrence in the contemporary era is largely asymmetric in nature with weaker powers relying on nuclear weapons to deter stronger adversaries. Third, the absence of severe confrontations and the limited capabilities of the relatively small Asian nuclear arsenals have resulted in general deterrence postures. The United States seeks capabilities to deal with a wide array of threats, but it does not confront an immediate conflict or crisis situation that warrants actor-specific threats that could result in nuclear retaliation. Finally, extended nuclear deterrence continues to be important to the national security of U. S. allied states in East Asia. China and certainly India and Pakistan do not have the capability or the strategic imperative to provide strategic protection to an ally against a threat from another nuclear power. Russia has the capability and plans to extend the deterrence function of its nuclear arsenal to protect Byelorussia and Armenia...|$|R
