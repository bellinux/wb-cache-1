40|$|For {{vibration}} {{analysis of}} aeroengine blisk structure, a prestressed component modal synthesis (CMS) super-element method is put {{forward with the}} fixed interface prestressing and free interface super-element approach. Based on this method, natural vibration characteristics of blisk structure are calculated at different modal truncation numbers. Comparing with the accurate result of global method, the selection principle of modal truncation number is obtained which affects the accuracy of prestressed CMS super-element method. Vibration response of two-stage blisk structure is calculated by this method, {{and the effects of}} different blade aspect ratios have been discussed on vibration characteristics. The results show that prestressed CMS super-element method is in the high accuracy and efficiency on blisk vibration analysis. Resonant frequencies in vibration response are nearly the same between the first-stage blisk and the second-stage blisk, and they are both approximately located in the range 588 [*]Hzâ€“ 599 [*]Hz. The maximum displacement and dynamic stress are at blade tip and root of the first-stage blisk, respectively. <b>Blade</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> is a key factor of blisk vibration; the effects of <b>blade</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> on natural frequencies are different in the conditions of fixed width and fixed length.

The paper builds on previous work proposing an analogy between the aerofoil in Darrieus motion and flapping-wing flow mechanisms. This analogy suggests that unsteadiness could be exploited to generate additional thrust and that this unsteady thrust generation is governed by rotor geometry. To confirm the hypothesis, this investigation incorporated unsteady effects into a rotor analysis which resolved the differences between experiments and predictions made using a steady-state assumption. The fundamental physics of starting were also studied and the rotor geometry parameters that govern the generation of unsteady thrust were explored: namely chord-to-diameter ratio and <b>blade</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio.</b> Further simulation showed that the Darrieus rotor is prone to be locked in a deadband where the thrust is not continuous around a blade rotation. This discrete thrust is caused by the large variation of incidence angle during start-up making the Darrieus blade ineffective during part of the rotation. The results also show that unsteady thrust can be promoted through an appropriate selection of <b>blade</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> and chord-to-diameter ratio and therefore it is possible to design rotors that have an ability to self-start.

Archived heliogyro analyses indicate that <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> of 1000 are feasible, but the calculations supporting this claim {{are based on the}} simplifying assumptions of decoupled twist, vertical deflection, and in-plane deflection of the blades.

A survey of treatments for three - dimensional flows highlights a variety of approaches, including longitudinal and tangential slots for suction and blowing, fences, turning vanes, fillets, and grooves. The merits and issues exposed by past implementations of these end-wall treatments are summarized. Considered together, these arrangements display a variable and open approach, which points towards an opportunity for considering a more common framework, led by a greater understanding of the flow physics.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{geometric}} variability on compressor performance is investigated using a compressor repeating-stage model based on well-known correlations for profile losses, endwall blockage, deviation, and {{the onset of}} stall. Previous computations with a quasi-two dimensional cascade analysis code are used to link geometric variability to performance deviations. Performance variability is then introduced probabilistically through random perturbations to tip clearances, profile losses and turning. For the variation input, at design incidence, the mean efficiency is found to decrease by 1 %, mostly due to the mean shift in profile losses, and the mean pressure rise is reduced by 2. 5 %, mostly because of the mean shift in turning. A parametric study for compressor stages of different designs shows a lower degradation of mean performance and a lower performance variability for stages which have higher work coefficient, lower degree of reaction, and higher <b>blade</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio.</b> It {{was found that the}} influence of blade profile effects was well represented, but the impact of tip clearance variation was not well captured when compared to three-dimensional computations.

But with time, the wake becomes ordered in the vicinity of the blade and wake distortions tend to flow downward. The wake contraction at the near wake was seen in fully developed wake structures. The comparison of the flow rates at different rotor speeds with that of experimental results shows a satisfactory agreement, indicating the validity of the present numerical model. Subsequently, effects of rotor speed, number of blades, <b>blade</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio,</b> and blade profile on the ceiling fan performance are qualitatively and quantitatively analysed. Moreover numerical analysis is extended for investigating the effect of ceiling on the rotor performance. Presence of ceiling degrades the flow rate of a ceiling fan. It can be concluded that the present model is capable of modelling flow around ceiling fans including its aerodynamics performance.

40|$|The current {{motivators}} in {{gas turbine}} aircraft engine design are improved efficiency and reduced engine weight. The drive for improved efficiency leads to high pressure ratio compressors with multiple stages, as thermodynamic efficiency increases with pressure ratio. These compressors are both heavy and expensive. Recent work by Kerrebrock, Merchant, and Schuler, {{has led to}} the possibility of achieving high pressure ratios with a {{reduction in the number of}} stages. These compressors use aspiration, or suction on the surface of the blades and end-walls, to keep the boundary layer attached under higher loading conditions, reducing losses. The work done by a rotor is related to the change in swirl across the blade and the rotational velocity of the blades. Counter-rotation provides for the largest change in swirl across a series of rotors, facilitating the largest pressure ratio. A three-stage, counter-rotating, compressor was designed to take advantage of these benefits. The tip speeds were kept as high as possible to increase the work done on the flow. The final design has a three-stage pressure ratio of 27, much higher than is currently available in three stages. The <b>blade</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> are smaller than on current compressors because of the large swirl change across each blade row. The flow passage has large contractions across each blade row, causing sharper turns in the flow path than is currently observed. The design consists of the flow passage, blade numbers and locations, rotor speeds, and desired swirl changes through each blade row. These data will allow later efforts to design the blade shapes. A mean line analysis was conducted to design a three stage turbine to drive the compressor. The benefits of counter-rotation are apparent in the turbine, as the turbine is designed without inter-rotor nozzles. Reduced engine weight and improved efficiency are available through the turbine section with the elimination of these nozzles. by Jeffrey H. Freedman. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} {{stability of}} titanium and composite <b>blades</b> of low <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> is examined over {{a range of}} design parameters, using a Rayleigh-Ritz formulation. The blade modes include a plate-type mode to account for chordwise bending. Chordwise flexibility is {{found to have a}} significant effect on the unstalled supersonic flutter of low <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>blades,</b> and also on the stability of tip sections of shrouded fan blades. For blades with a thickness of less than approximately four percent of chord, the chordwise, second bending, and first torsion branches are all unstable at moderately high supersonic Mach numbers. For composite blades, the important structural coupling between bending and torsion cannot be modeled properly unless chordwise bending is accounted for. Typically, aft fiber sweep produces beneficial bending-torsion coupling that is stabilizing, whereas forward fiber sweep has the opposite effect. By using crossed-ply laminate configurations, critical aeroelastic modes can be stabilized...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of axial-flow compressors {{is known to}} be adversely affected by increasing the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> (the ratio of blade height to chord length). Experimental investigations have been carried out on a single-stage, low speed axial-flow compressor with a parallel annulus and a hub-tip ratio of 0. 750. The tests were conducted at two <b>blade</b> <b>aspect</b> ratios; one and two. The Reynolds number was held constant at 1. 9 x I @ by testing each aspeot ratio at different speeds. The tip clearances and blade row axial spacing at the inner diameter were kept identical for both <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios.</b> The overall performance characteristics show that the compressor of <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> 1 has a wider range of operation and In general a higher static pressure rise than that for the compressor of <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> 2. Traverses show that the three-dimensional flow outside the wall boundary layers is substantially the same for both aspeot ratios. They also show that the major <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> effect is oaused by wall stall which occur...|$|R
