Although Coulson stated that the Hawaii Mars has been under numerous recent upgrades to make it safer and more reliable, no <b>buyers</b> <b>have</b> come forward to purchase the aircraft.

500|$|Richard Leakey, who was {{responsible}} for the first major ivory destruction in Kenya in 1989, argues that these acts are primarily about sending a message to foster a public that sees the value in wildlife itself, not its byproducts, and thereby influencing the demand side of the market. In explaining the [...] "enormous impact" [...] that he saw after the 1989 event, Leakey said that [...] "up to that time we'd been losing about three and a half thousand to four thousand elephants a year, and a year later we were losing at most sixty." [...] Consumer research in China, the world's largest consumer of ivory, showed that many potential <b>buyers</b> <b>have</b> little understanding of the connection between the ivory trade and steep declines in elephant populations. High-profile government events bring the problem to large numbers of people and affirm a government stance for anyone who had been unclear. The events also aim to signal decreasing acceptance and popularity of ivory goods, making them less desirable by lowering their status and shaming individuals, organizations, and institutions who buy, sell, or own the goods. In China, prices fell by nearly half between 2015 and 2016, following the government announcement that it would begin phasing out its domestic ivory trade. According to Hongxiang Huang in a report by NPR, the decline was not likely due to conservation reasons, but because [...] "ne thing that proud Chinese people don't want to be, these days, is behind the times." ...|$|E

When both the seller and the <b>buyer</b> <b>have</b> private information, selling advice can strictly increase the probability of trade, and it is welfare-improving for both parties. In the private-value setting, Myerson-Satterthwaite no-trade theorem can be overcome by this mechanism.

30|$|Interviewees about BigEnergy {{assessed}} {{uncertainty in}} terms of whether the <b>buyer</b> <b>had</b> experience in the target sector. The interviewees perceived uncertainty as low because the target and the buyer were in the same sector. Interestingly, the interviewees also assessed controversy based on their past experience. The <b>buyer</b> <b>had</b> experienced little success in global markets, which made the deal controversial in the organization. In addition, the target had many stakeholders, including foreign employees, local communities, foreign governments, and other consumer groups, which added further layers of controversies to the deal.|$|R

[...] Hence, any given <b>buyer</b> <b>has</b> a demand schedule that generally decreases in response to price (at least until quantity demanded reaches zero).
