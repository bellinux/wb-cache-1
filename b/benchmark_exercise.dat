40|$|One of the {{problems}} of innovative reactor plant (RP) with supercritical water SCWR is providing its operation stability. Mechanisms that cause instability are similar to those that occur in boiling-water reactors BWR. However, they may have some specific features concerning, for example, deteriorated heat transfer conditions and appreciably greater thermodynamic liquid nonequilibrium in the flow. Therefore the tasks of development and verification of computational methods and programs that would allow to define SCWR stability boundaries are urgent. Within IAEA Coordinated Research Project (CRP) «Heat Transfer Behaviour and Thermo-hydraulics Codes Testing for SCWRs» it was proposed to take the first step and to propose thermal-hydraulic codes testing on the basis of available data or data that are developed by CRP participants. The testing was realized comparing the results of different codes and computational methods, with the purpose to reveal possible mistakes and shortcomings, and to estimate possible range of computational results. Specifications of two benchmarks were prepared: -	<b>Benchmark</b> <b>Exercise</b> No. 1 «Steady state flow in a heated pipe» (hosted by OKB «GIDROPRESS»); -	<b>Benchmark</b> <b>Exercise</b> No. 2 «Stability» (hosted by University of Pisa, Italia). A circular pipe 4. 27 m in length, inside diameter 8. 4 mm and uniform heating was considered in <b>Benchmark</b> <b>Exercise</b> No. 2. It was necessary to plot flow instability boundary of water and other liquids in the plane of dimensionless groups NSPC and NTPC that define, correspondingly, liquid underheating to pseudo critical temperature at heated channel inlet (sub-pseudocritical number) and liquid heating in the channel (trans-pseudocritical number). At the same time it was necessary to perform the analysis for various values of local coefficient of hydraulic resistance at pipe inlet, for vertical and horizontal flows. Calculations of <b>Benchmark</b> <b>Exercise</b> No. 2 for vertical water flow were performed in OKB «GIDROPRESS» by thermal-hydraulic code TEMPA-SC. There was some difference between calculated boundaries of stable water flow and those obtained by methods based on linear stability analysis. This difference was increasing as local coefficient of hydraulic resistance at inlet was decreasing. Sensitivity analysis of TEMPA-SC calculation results to different parameters of the computational model was performed. <b>Benchmark</b> <b>Exercise</b> No. 2 is described in the report. The calculation results of OKB «GIDROPRESS» and the results of linear stability analysis of the University of Pisa are presented...|$|E

Since 1997 the Dutch water {{companies}} {{have engaged in}} a voluntary <b>exercise</b> to <b>benchmark</b> their performance against each other, {{in order to improve}} their efficiency and increase transparency.

The Dutch <b>benchmarking</b> <b>exercise</b> covers four areas: water quality; service; environment; and finance and efficiency.

The objectives of the project are the development of a standard for fracture resistance testing of multi-metallic specimens and the development of harmonized procedures for dissimilar metal welds (DMWs) for brittle and ductile integrity assessment. Part of the project is a <b>benchmark</b> <b>exercise</b> involving elastic-plastic finite element (FE) analyses on standard fracture testing specimens to determine J integral values and η factors to accompany the fracture test program of the project.

40|$|This paper {{shares the}} {{experiences}} of 5 universities involved in a <b>benchmarking</b> <b>exercise</b> on e-learning in 2009 through ESMU. A total of 9 European universities participated in the exercise {{with the purpose of}} evaluating their existing e-learning practices and policies and getting advice on which areas to improve and how. Initially, the paper discusses the benchmarking concept and reasons why institutions should engage in <b>benchmarking</b> <b>exercises.</b> <b>Benchmarking</b> is viewed as a method for quality assurance and enhancement in higher education. Self-assessment is involved at the participating institutions, which leads to a high level of awareness and understanding of existing practices and policies at different levels of the organisation. Benchmarking is thus an efficient self-improvement tool. In chapter two, the planning of the <b>benchmarking</b> <b>exercise</b> is outlined. A combination of an individual, collaborative and expert approach to benchmarking was chosen. Chapter three deals with the creation of the benchmarking questionnaire which was a collaborative effort between all nine participating universities, ESMU and EADTU. Taking their starting point in the online E-xellence benchmarking tool developed by EADTU, participants reformulated, deleted and added benchmarks within the following six categories: Strategic management, curriculum design, course design, course delivery, staff support and student support. An effort was made to translate the E-xellence questions to the blended learning context of the participating universities. The internal data collection and formulation of responses are accounted for in chapter 4 which also contains reflections on the challenges and benefits of the selected approaches. Chapter five presents the overall conclusions of the <b>benchmarking</b> <b>exercise</b> within each of the six benchmark categories. The final chapter discusses and provides examples of how participants can use the benchmarking results to improve existing practices and policies and outlines potential external collaboration opportunities between participants...|$|R

The benchmark {{consisted of two}} phases, i. e. a blind and an open calculation task. Seven organizations from the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Finland participated in the <b>benchmark</b> <b>exercise,</b> and four system codes were utilized in the benchmark simulation tasks. Two workshops were organized for launching and concluding the benchmark, the latter of which involved presentations of the calculation results as well as discussions on the related modeling issues. The chosen experiment for the benchmark was a small break {{loss of coolant accident}} experiment which was performed to study the natural circulation behavior over a continuous range of primary side coolant inventories. For the blind calculation task, the detailed facility descriptions, the measured pressure and heat losses as well as the results of a short characterizing transient were provided. For the open calculation task part, the experiment results were released. According to the simulation results, the benchmark experiment was quite challenging to model. Several improvements were found and utilized especially for the open calculation case. The issues concerned model construction, heat and pressure losses impact, interpreting measured and calculated data, noncondensable gas effect, testing several condensation and CCFL correlations, sensitivity studies, as well as break modeling. There is a clear need for user guidelines or for a collection of best practices in modeling for every code.
