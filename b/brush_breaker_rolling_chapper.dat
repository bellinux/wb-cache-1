5|$|Members of {{the wing}} {{had the option of}} moving with the F-15s to Barnes, but most decided to stay behind and train for new missions. The crash trucks went to Barnes, leaving the <b>brush</b> <b>breakers</b> of the Massachusetts Military Reservation behind. The {{buildings}} formerly occupied by the fighter wing, including the hangars, will be occupied by the intelligence mission.|$|R
60|$|After many failures, he at last {{caught the}} line. This he {{fastened}} to the spar, and signaled to those on shore to pull it in; then, {{side by side with}} the dog, he followed. Looking round behind him, he watched a great <b>breaker</b> <b>rolling</b> in and, as before, dived as it passed over his head, and rode forward on the swell towards the shore.|$|R
25|$|During {{the time}} {{preceding}} the wing reaching full operational capacity, {{members of the}} wing {{had the option of}} moving with the F-15s to Barnes. Most members decided to stay behind and train for their new missions. The crash trucks moved with the F-15s to Barnes, leaving the <b>brush</b> <b>breakers</b> of the Massachusetts Military Reservation behind. The buildings formerly occupied by the planes will be reused for the intelligence mission by wing members. These buildings include the hangars that the F-15s formerly occupied.|$|R
5000|$|The {{harvest of}} 1972 {{was a tough}} one for Napa, but these <b>brush</b> <b>breakers</b> persevered. Soon, Tom {{was on the road}} selling his Napa Valley wines just like he used to sell Morse Controls. He had certain skills that helped him thrive: his early {{exposure}} to enology, his recent connections with influential and well-placed wine lovers, and his ability to fly. He opened up new markets for Burgess wine as well as other Napa Valley labels. In fact, Tom was the first to sell a California wine to a couple of major distributors! ...|$|R
60|$|It is {{supposed}} that this swell {{is caused by}} distant westerly gales in the Atlantic, which force an undue quantity of water into the North Sea, and thus produce the apparent paradox of great <b>rolling</b> <b>breakers</b> in calm weather.|$|R
6000|$|... [70] There is a {{piece of}} tone of the same kind, equal in one part, [...] but not so united {{with the rest of the}} picture, in the storm scene [...] illustrative of the Antiquary,--a sunset light on {{polished}} sea. I [...] ought to have particularly mentioned the sea in the Lowestoffe, as a [...] piece of the cutting motion of shallow water, under storm, [...] altogether in gray, which should be especially contrasted, as a [...] piece of color, with the grays of Vandevelde. And the sea in the [...] Great Yarmouth should have been noticed for its expression of water [...] in violent agitation, seen in enormous extent from a great [...] elevation. There is almost every form of sea in it,--rolling waves [...] dashing on the pier--successive <b>breakers</b> <b>rolling</b> to the shore--a [...] vast horizon of multitudinous waves--and winding canals of calm [...] water along the sands, bringing fragments of bright sky down into [...] their yellow waste. There is hardly one of the views of the Southern [...] Coast which does not give some new condition or circumstance of sea.|$|R
60|$|When the {{children}} went on deck the next morning, {{the southern coast}} of Ireland was all in full view. Those who feel an interest in seeing the track of the ship, will find, by turning to a map of Great Britain and Ireland, that her course in going in from the Atlantic toward Liverpool lay at first along the southern coast of Ireland, and then along the western coast of Wales. This route, though it seems but a short distance on the map, requires really a voyage of several hundred miles, {{and more than a}} day in time, for the performance of it. The voyage of the ship is, therefore, by no means ended when she reaches the land at Cape Clear. There is still a day and a night more for the passengers to spend on board the vessel. The time is, however, very much beguiled during this last day's sail by the sight of the land and the various objects which it presents to view--the green slopes, the castle-covered hills, the cliffs, the lines of beach, with surf and <b>breakers</b> <b>rolling</b> in upon them; and sometimes, when the ship approaches nearer to the shore than usual, the pretty little cottages, covered with thatch, and adorned with gardens and shrubbery.|$|R
60|$|They made a last effort, {{the boat}} slid clear. Twelve three-tongued paddles smote the water together, and Redmond watched the craft rise almost upright with bows buried in froth and seafire as another majestic <b>breaker</b> came <b>rolling</b> in. Then {{he turned and}} raced shoreward for his life, with an acre of foam close behind him. When he halted again the surf-boat had {{vanished}} into the hollow of the sea, but the howling of those who paddled her, and the helmsman's sulphurous encouragement, rising above the roar of waters, betokened her safety.|$|R
60|$|By degrees {{the white}} line {{expanded}} {{in size and}} became massive, as though a huge <b>breaker</b> were <b>rolling</b> towards them; ever and anon jets of foam flew {{high into the air}} from various parts of the mass, like smoke from a cannon's mouth. Presently, a low continuous roar became audible above the noise of the oars; as the boat advanced, the swells from the south-east could be seen towering upwards as they neared the foaming spot, gradually changing their broad-backed form, and coming on in majestic walls of green water, which fell with indescribable grandeur into the seething caldron. No rocks were visible, there was no apparent cause for this wild confusion {{in the midst of the}} otherwise calm sea. But the fishermen knew that the Bell Rock was underneath the foam, and that in less than an hour its jagged peaks would be left uncovered by the falling tide.|$|R
60|$|The men {{pulled at}} the hawser, and shoved might and main with the oars. They succeeded in getting out of {{immediate}} danger, but still could not {{pull up to the}} anchor in teeth of wind and tide. The coxswain then saw plainly that there was but one resource left--to cut the cable and drive right across the Goodwin Sands. But there was not yet sufficient water on the Sands to float them over; so they held on, intending to ride at anchor until the tide, which had turned, should rise. Very soon, however, the anchor began to drag. This compelled them to hoist sail, cut the cable sooner than they had intended, and attempt to beat off the Sands. It was in vain. A moment more, and they struck with tremendous force. A <b>breaker</b> came <b>rolling</b> towards them, filled the boat, caught her up like a plaything on its crest, and, hurling her a few yards onwards, let her fall again with a shock that well-nigh tore every man out of her. Each successive breaker treated her in this way.|$|R
5000|$|... "My Dear Sir - Allow me {{to return}} you (in {{the name of}} the crew of the St. George and myself) our most {{grateful}} thanks for the very great personal exertions of yourself, Lieut. Robinson (RN)., Mr William Corlett and the Life Boat's crew during the gale of yesterday morning.I want words, Sir, to express to you what we then felt, and what we shall ever feel, for the noble and determined manner in which you persevered in coming to our assistance, after we had considered it our duty to warn you off, for, the vessel having bilged, the severity of the gale, the position of the wind, and the time of the tide, there did not appear to us (amongst the heavy <b>breakers</b> then <b>rolling</b> upon Conister) the slightest chance of escape for you, and which, from the crippled state of the life boat when she afterwards left the wreck, was so nearly proving to be the case.Trusting, Sir, that you may long live to preside over an establishment your philanthropy gave birth to, and in which your humanity has always placed you amongst the foremost and most active of its members - I have the honor to remainYour obliged, grateful, and Most obedient servant" [...] Lieutenant John Tudor (RN). Douglas, November 21st, 1830.|$|R
6000|$|At {{that moment}} the boat lifted {{a little on the}} surf and {{grounded}} again. New hope was inspired by this. They pulled at the cable and shoved might and main with the oars. They succeeded in getting out of immediate danger, but still could not pull up to their anchor in the teeth of wind and tide. The coxswain then saw plainly that there was but one resource left--to cut the cable and drive away to leeward right across the Goodwin Sands, which at that place were two miles wide. But there was not yet sufficient water on the sands even for the attempting of that forlorn hope. As far as could be seen in that direction, ay, and far beyond the power of vision, there was nothing but a chaos of wild, tumultuous, whirling foam, without sufficient depth to float them over, so they held on, intending to wait till the tide, which had turned, should rise. Very soon, however, the anchor began to drag. This compelled them to hoist sail, cut the cable sooner than they had intended, and attempt to beat to windward--off the sands. It was in vain. A moment more, and they struck with tremendous force. A <b>breaker</b> came <b>rolling</b> towards them, filled the boat, caught her up like a plaything on its crest, and, hurling her a few yards onwards, let her fall with a shock that well-nigh tore every man out of her. Each successive breaker treated her in this way! ...|$|R
6000|$|So the Queen Boadicea, {{standing}} loftily charioted, [...] Brandishing in {{her hand}} a dart and rolling glances lioness-like, [...] Yell'd and shriek'd between her daughters in her fierce volubility. [...] Till her people all around the royal chariot agitated, [...] Madly dash'd the darts together, writhing barbarous lineaments, [...] Made the noise of frosty woodlands, when they shiver in January, [...] Roar'd as when the <b>rolling</b> <b>breakers</b> boom and blanch on the precipices, [...] Yell'd as when the winds of winter tear an oak on a promontory. [...] So the silent colony hearing her tumultuous adversaries [...] Clash the darts and on the buckler beat with rapid unanimous hand, [...] Thought on all her evil tyrannies, all her pitiless avarice, [...] Till she felt the heart within her fall and flutter tremulously, [...] Then her pulses at the clamoring of her enemy fainted away. [...] Out of evil evil flourishes, out of tyranny tyranny buds. [...] Ran the land with Roman slaughter, multitudinous agonies. [...] Perish'd many a maid and matron, many a valorous legionary. [...] Fell the colony, city, and citadel, London, Verulam, Camulodune.|$|R
60|$|They {{knocked up}} an inn-keeper in King's Lynn, {{and the two}} men ate and drank. Deane himself drank a long whiskey and soda, and lit a cigar. Then they rushed onward into the darkness, already {{lightening}} a little in the east. Dawn was breaking as they climbed their last hill and ran down toward the marshlands. A red light loomed over the gray, sullen sea. The marshes themselves seemed heavy and undistinguishable--patches of land and dark creeks of salt-water running into one another. Out in the bay the foam-topped <b>breakers</b> came <b>rolling</b> sullenly in. When at last they turned through the gate, and went slowly up the rough road--marked out with white stakes--which led up to the tower, the dawn had actually come, the night was a thing of the past, although its shadow seemed to hang low over the gray land. The sea had been lately over the rough road, and progress was difficult. At last, though, they reached the little bank of shingle on which the tower was built, and Deane, with a little sigh of relief, stepped wearily down. While his servant unlocked the front door and busied himself arranging a bed and lighting a fire, Deane walked down {{to the edge of the}} sea, whose white-topped waves were dragging back the shingle as they fell and broke, with a dull, grinding noise. Never, it seemed to him, had the beauty of loneliness appealed to him more strongly than at this hour of dawn. The birds were silent, the wind had fallen, there was no sound whatever from the sleeping land. Only the eternal breaking of the waves continued--a sound which was more like the background for stillness, grim and mysterious, inevitable as existence itself. Far away now seemed that crowded court, with its eager faces, its rapt issues,--far away seemed the importance of wealth, the great question whether he should remain amongst the millionaires--the world buyers, or take his place amongst the poor men of the earth. What did it matter, after all, this kingship of the cities, with their lack of perspective, their crowded hours, their strange, artificial atmosphere? The value of these things was, grotesque, for a moment,--distorted. He had been wise to come here, he told himself, as a breath of the morning wind stole, faint and fresh, across the salt sea. Perhaps he would be wiser still if he defied fortune and stayed here always.|$|R
