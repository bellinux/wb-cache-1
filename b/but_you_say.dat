Horrible!” And it’s a very slow, sinking feeling when you’re watching the movie, {{and the first}} scene comes out, and you’re like, “Oh, that’s a really bad scene.” <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> “Well, that’s okay, the next one’ll be better.” And you somehow try to convince yourself that it’s going to get better… and it just gets worse. And I was like, “Wow. That was crazy.” I mean, I really didn’t see that coming. So at that point, I distanced myself from the movie. Now, of course, it has a whole other life {{as a sort of}} inadvertent… satire. No, “satire” isn’t the right word. But it’s inadvertently funny. So it’s found its place. It provides entertainment, though not in the way I think it was originally intended. It was just… maybe the wrong material with the wrong director and the wrong cast.Showgirls was universally derided by film critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 19% based on 48 reviews with the consensus; [...] "Vile, contemptible, garish, and misogynistic -- and that might just be exactly Showgirls' point." [...] Metacritic give the film an average score of 16/100, indicating [...] "Overwhelming dislike.
