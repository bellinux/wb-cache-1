Computer-aided auscultation is sensitive to external noise and bodily sounds and requires an almost silent environment to function accurately.|$|E

25|$|Andrew Symonds scored 101 {{and took}} two wickets for 46 to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the sides at Old Trafford.

The Sussex chase looked on when they were 112 for 1 with Matt Prior and Chris Adams at the crease, as they were just waiting for opportunities to up the run-rate, but instead Symonds and England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff ran through them with the ball, and Robin Martin-Jenkins and Ahmed eventually had to consolidate to 214 for 8, losing by 35 runs.|$|E
25|$|Van Barneveld took a 3–2 lead in sets over Mark Webster in {{the third}} round of the 2014 World Championship, but from there on could not win another leg as he exited the tournament losing 4–3. He had a poor run of form in the UK Open Qualifiers to be placed 66th on the Order of Merit meaning he entered the tournament in the first round stage. Van Barneveld enjoyed four {{comfortable}} victories to reach the fifth round where he was comprehensively beaten 9–2 by Adrian Lewis. He produced some of his most consistent darts in years during the Premier League as he remained unbeaten for 12 matches during the season to finish second in the table. In the semi-finals he secured his first ever win over Phil Taylor in the tournament after 21 attempts, having fought back from 4–1 down to triumph 8–5. It {{was the first time he}} had advanced beyond the semi-finals of the event, after losing at this stage in six previous years. Van Barneveld then won four successive legs from 5–5 in the final against Michael van Gerwen and went on to win the title 10–6. His finishing proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> him and the rest of the nine players as throughout the 18 matches his checkout percentage was 50.22, seven percent higher than Simon Whitlock in second place. Afterwards, Van Barneveld revealed he had received therapy for depression in January due to the monotony of travelling and playing in events every week.|$|E

500|$|Central to Colbert's {{personality}} is his rigid belief that [...] "what I say is right, and [...] anyone else says {{could possibly be}} true", regardless of any evidence to the contrary. He discussed this in the Reports first Wørd segment, using the term [...] "truthiness" [...] as he explained what he perceives to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> [...] "those who think with their head and those who know with their heart". He has further gone on to ascribe [...] "truthiness" [...] to other institutions including Wikipedia, which he believes upholds his view that reality can be determined by consensus opinion, and often encourages viewers to use Wikipedia to [...] "change reality". Colbert believes that if a majority of people want something to be true, that thing therefore must become the truth. For instance, after months of scoffing at global warming, Colbert suddenly reversed his position, conceding its existence only due to the box office success of An Inconvenient Truth, a sign that [...] "the free market has spoken".|$|E

Chelsea set the early pace and emerged in a three-way tussle for the league title with Manchester United and Leeds United. The League Cup was secured thanks to a 3–2 first leg win against Leicester City, with a memorable solo effort from McCreadie proving to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the sides, and then a hard-fought 0–0 draw in the second leg at Filbert Street.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} {{point about the}} Act {{is that there is}} some confusion about whom it covers. Most British people will be covered, but often vulnerable workers are not. Under section 230 of the Act the word [...] "employee" [...] is defined to mean somebody with a [...] "contract of employment". This in turn means someone who has a [...] "contract of service". In legal cases since the early 1980s, some judges have placed a restrictive interpretation on what that means. The opposite of a [...] "contract of service" [...] is a [...] "contract for services", and it is meant to draw the line between someone who is working for another, on their account, under their control and someone who is working on their own account, controlling their own work. In other words, it is meant to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the truly [...] "employed" [...] and the [...] "self employed".|$|E

If the process moves to greater entropy, the area under the curve will be the amount of heat absorbed by the system in that process. If the process moves towards lesser entropy, it will be the amount of heat removed. For any cyclic process, there will be an upper portion of the cycle and a lower portion. For a clockwise cycle, the area under the upper portion will be the thermal energy absorbed during the cycle, while the area under the lower portion will be the thermal energy removed during the cycle.

2500|$|Under this approach, {{the bond}} price should reflect its [...] "arbitrage-free" [...] price, as any {{deviation}} from this price will be exploited and the bond will then quickly reprice to its correct level.

Therefore, (2) some multiple (or fraction) of zero-coupon bonds, each {{corresponding to the}} bond's coupon dates, can be specified so as to produce identical cash flows to the bond. Thus (3) the bond price today must be equal to the sum of each of its cash flows discounted at the discount rate implied by {{the value of the}} corresponding ZCB. [...] Were this not the case, (4) the arbitrageur could finance his purchase of whichever of the bond or the sum of the various ZCBs was cheaper, by short selling the other, and meeting his cash flow commitments using the coupons or maturing zeroes as appropriate.

2500|$|Warmachine {{is similar}} to many other {{miniature}} wargames in that each army consists of several units, each of which acts during a turn. Individual units move, attack, and may perform other actions such as repairing a warjack or using a feat. The primary mechanic unique to Warmachine {{is the use of}} focus points. Each warcaster receives a certain number of focus points each turn, which represents that warcaster's power. At the beginning of the turn, focus may be spent to pay for ongoing abilities and allocated between the warlord and 'jacks in the caster's battlegroup within their [...] "Control Area" [...] or sphere of influence - a distance based on the 'caster's focus stat. Focus allows warjacks to become more accurate and powerful by [...] "boosting" [...] their attacks, and to perform special actions called [...] "Power Attacks" [...] such as slamming a model across the battlefield with their heft or throwing an enemy model at another model. [...] Additionally warcasters can use focus to cast spells performing all manner of arcane effects from attacks, to movement bonuses, to offensive/defensive enhancements. [...] Good focus management can often <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> winning and losing. The warcaster {{is the single most important}} model on either side in the game.
