25|$|A {{smurf attack}} relies on misconfigured network devices that allow packets {{to be sent}} to all {{computer}} hosts on a particular network via the <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> of the network, rather than a specific machine. The attacker will send large numbers of IP packets with the source address faked to appear to be the address of the victim. The network's bandwidth is quickly used up, preventing legitimate packets from getting through to their destination.|$|E
25|$|The PID query and {{response}} occurs on the vehicle's CAN bus. Standard OBD requests {{and response}}s use functional addresses.

ECUs that can respond to OBD queries listen both to the functional broadcast ID of 7DFh and one assigned ID in the range 7E0h to 7E7h. Their response has an ID of their assigned ID plus 8 e.g. 7E8h through 7EFh.|$|E

The parade, which lasted about five hours, included 12 companies of the Luftwaffe, 12 companies of the army, and 12 companies of the navy, as well as units of the Schutzstaffel (SS). In total, 40,000 to 50,000 German troops took part. 162 warplanes flew over Berlin. The grandstand comprised 20,000 official guests, and the parade was watched by several hundred thousand spectators. Features of the parade were large long range air defence artillery guns, emphasis on motorized artillery and development of air defense units.

50|$|A <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> is {{an address}} that allows {{information}} {{to be sent to}} all interfaces in a given subnet, rather than a specific machine. Generally, the <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> is found by obtaining the bit complement of the subnet mask and performing a bitwise OR operation with the network identifier. In other words, the <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> is the last address in the address range of the subnet. For example, the <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> for the network 192.168.5.0 is 192.168.5.255. For networks of size /24 or larger, the <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> always ends in 255.|$|E
50|$|A <b>broadcast</b> <b>address</b> is {{a logical}} address at which all devices {{connected}} to a multiple-access communications network are enabled to receive datagrams.

40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} pin-constrained electrowetting-ondielectric (EWOD) biochips becomes {{a serious issue}} to realize complex bio-chemical operations. Due to limited number of control pins and routing resources, {{additional}} Printed Circuit Board (PCB) routing layers may be required which poten-tially raises the fabrication cost. Previous state-of-the-art work has tried to develop a framework that uses a network-flow-based method for broadcast electrodeaddressing EWOD biochips. Nevertheless, greedily merging of electrical pins in previous works is {{at high risk of}} producing unroutable design. Routability should have higher priority than pin reduction. While previous works dedicated their effort on pin reduction, we have addressed our attention on routability of <b>broadcast</b> <b>addressing.</b> Experimental results demonstrate that taking routability into consideration can even have higher pin reduction. Viewed in this light, we present ACER, a routability driven clustering algorithm followed by escape routing using integer linear programming that effectively solves both pin merging and routing in <b>broadcast</b> <b>addressing</b> framework. Our proposed algorithm does not greedily focus on pin-reduction. Instead, routability is taken into consideration through agglomerative clustering. Compared to previous state-of-the-art, our proposed algorithm can further reduce required control pins by an average of 13 % and route the design using 68 % less wirelength.
