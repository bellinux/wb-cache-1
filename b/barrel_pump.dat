40|$|Lecturepg. 1 It {{should be}} an {{objective}} to predict bearing housing vibrations by means of finite element methods and avoid them in the design phase rather than to go in for corrective actions on the test bed or in the field. Bearing housing vibrations due to an excitation by the impeller vanes occur, {{if there is a}} natural frequency of the pump. The finite element method is a useful tool to determine natural frequencies but it is still necessary to compare them with real tested structures. Especially the connecting stiffness between different parts in a structure and the boundary conditions has often to be estimated. Within this paper the determination of bearing housing frequencies has been undertaken systematically from a simple test device to a complete <b>barrel</b> <b>pump.</b> With the test device several influences onto the natural frequencies were studied, such as internal pressure, bolting, seals, and foundation stiffness. It is demonstrated that with appropriate modeling and assumptions the measured frequencies can be accurately met by means of finite elements. The rules observed were applied to full 3 -D model of a <b>barrel</b> <b>pump.</b> The natural frequencies were determined by means of this finite element model. An experimental modal analysis was carried out on the real structure of this pump assembly. At several locations of the surface transducers were placed and the response due to the hammer test was identified in terms of frequencies and modal shapes. This result was correlated with the finite element results to update the finite element model and obtain better congruence between experiment and analysis. The results were promising, especially for the most important bearing housing natural frequency, where the differences between analysis and test were very low. This gives confidence to future analyses of bearing housing vibrations...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 17 Modifications to a high-pressure, {{high-temperature}} <b>barrel</b> <b>pump</b> {{to increase}} seal reliability and throughout are discussed. The pump is in unspared hydrodewaxer (HDW) feed service. The original seal design included nonpressurized dual seals {{to provide an}} additional level of reliability. However, due to the heavy-oil/high-temperature nature of the service, the dual seals produced less than desirable run times. Substantial modifications to the dual seals were made to improve their reliability, but this also proved to be disappointing. Finally, the dual seals were replaced with single seals of a different design resulting in much more favorable results. The paper provides {{a detailed description of}} both seal modifications and their results. After approximately two years of service the capacity of the pump become the unit limit. The throughput of the pump was increased by approximately 25 percent without substantial capital outlays. This performance increase was accomplished by modifying the impeller diameter, the impeller vane tip widths, and reducing the internal circulation through the use of high temperature abraidable materials and reduced internal clearances. These modifications were preceded by a rotordynamic analysis of the pump before and after the internal clearances were reduced.

40|$|The instant {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a peristaltic pump for critical laboratory or hospital applications requiring precise flow rates {{over an extended period}} of time. Within the cylindrical <b>barrel</b> <b>pump</b> housing is a single-piece, molded, elastometric, cylindrical liner with a multiplicity of flattened helical channels created therein from one end of the liner to the other. Three cylindrical rollers rotate about the center axis of the pump around the inside surface of the liner selectively compressing the liner, and hence the helical channels between the rollers and the barrel housing, creating a pumping action by forcing trapped fluid in the helical channels axially from one end of the liner to the opposite end. The novelty of the invention appears to lie in the provision of the special liner with multiple helical channels as the pumping chamber, rather than the standard single elastomeric tubing which is squeezed repeatedly by rollers to move the liquid through a typical peristaltic pump. Large, repeated deflections on the standard tubing causes a permanent set in the tubing, thus either changing the flow rate, or requiring a new section of tubing to be positioned in the pump head. Further, this configuration minimizes the amount of outflow pulsation which is characteristic of a typical single tubing peristaltic pump...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 33 Sealing {{volatile}} high-pressure fluids {{has always}} been a challenge unless the temperature is cold enough to produce a true liquid state around the seal. Even handling true liquids having low boiling points can result in low life expectancy due to the flashing of the fluid as it approaches atmospheric pressure and is heated by the seal faces. As pressure levels and temperatures increase above cryogenic, {{there is a need for}} technologies other than conventional contacting seals. Fluids handled in a supercritical state are particularly difficult since they are not in a true liquid state to begin with, and lubricity of the ?dense phase vapor? is extremely poor. API 682, Second Edition, (2002) recognizes the use of noncontacting dual unpressurized seals for this type of service. This paper will present the application of a dual unpressurized seal with noncontact lift-off faces to a high-pressure volatile fluid. This application required a high-energy pump at an elevated speed to create the pressure and flow required by the process. The alternative to this pump was a reciprocating compressor, which had been used on previous process units. Compared with the pump compressor option would have been significantly more expensive to purchase and would have resulted in increased maintenance over the life of the process unit. The pump selected was a nine-stage <b>barrel</b> <b>pump</b> rotating at 6686 rpm driven by an electric motor through a gearbox. The fluid being pumped was ethylene. Suction pressure was 950 psig. The ethylene was chilled to an operating temperature of 50 F so that the pump could develop the head necessary to produce the required discharge pressure of 4450 psig. The seals selected have now run for over two years with no failures. This includes several issues with the pump during which the pump was disassembled to correct vibration problems. At these times, the seals were removed from the pump and were not even reconditioned but were just reinstalled. Under similar conditions, a contacting seal would have been reconditioned each time the seals were removed and would have had an ultimate life expectancy of only six months...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 97 The suction-impeller (single-suction) of a 33, 500 hp, four-stage <b>barrel</b> <b>pump</b> used in {{boiler feed}} service at a fossil fuel steam plant {{experienced}} operating life ranging from 6. 0 to 19 months. Cavitation erosion on the suction surface {{and in the}} hub fillet area caused this unacceptably short life. This pump design is unique in that its suction-stage operates at an inlet tip velocity of 281 ft/sec. This tip speed, coupled with a stage pressure rise of about 1160 psi places this machine well {{into the category of}} ?high energy? pumps, and signals the need for special design attention to elements of its hydraulic design in order to provide suitable performance, reliability and operability. In a joint program with the user and the pump manufacturer, the problem was investigated, a test program conducted, redesign of the impeller completed and replacement impellers commissioned in the field. Elements of the investigation and test program included the impeller design itself, suction bay distortions and effects of distorted flow generated by the upstream piping. The redesign was accomplished through the use of sophisticated computational techniques and experimental flow visualization. The final design, referred to as a biased-wedge, was manufactured using a precision, lost wax casting process, with a special stereolithographic technique used to translate the final blade design into usable patterns. One of the final set of impellers was tested using flow visualization. The test program confirmed that the final design was free of cavitation bubbles at the baseload condition and significantly reduced vapor activity and hence damage potential at min-flow. The effects of flow distortions (on cavitation activity) presented to the impeller by the suction bay (so prevalent with the conventional design) was effectively countered by the biased-wedge design. Finally, the flow distortions (both introduction of swirl and uneven mass distribution) at the pump suction flange were modeled and tested with both conventional and biased-wedge impellers. In both cases, these distortions had no effect on the formation or collapse of cavitation vapor in the impeller eye. These conclusions are valid for only this single-suction type of configuration. The impellers have been commissioned in the field units and are currently accumulating operational hours...|$|E

40|$|LectureAs the {{pressure}} in older oil wells decrease over time, water injection services are becoming more prevalent on offshore platforms. Water injection is used to maintain {{the pressure}} in the wells and displace the oil from the reservoir, which improves the output and can {{extend the life of}} the formation. Formation pressures are normally high and require equal or higher pressure to force the water in. These applications are typically handled by high speed, high pressure <b>barrel</b> <b>pumps</b> that can see frequent start/stop cycles.

These effects can be minimized by controlling the amount of heat generated as well as how the components of the seal react to increased temperature.

The pumps are driven by a 600 HP (447 kW) four-pole induction motor through double helical gear increasers. The overall vibration amplitude of the pump casing and the shaft were determined to be acceptable. However, one of the pumps was found with shaft repetitive cracking failures (MTBF = 7. 3 years) initiated away from the key-way stress concentration area, under the later stage impellers, in a zone where fretting was occurring. Several attempts pursued by the plant and their supplier, over the years, did not find the root cause of this shaft cracking problem, in spite of the good troubleshooting procedures and careful installation practices pursued. Therefore, an exceptionally comprehensive root cause investigation was implemented, with specialty vibration testing at its core. Thorough vibration testing combining spectral and timetransient vibration testing on the pump casing and shaft, Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) testing of the impeller and pump casing, and Operating Deflection Shape (ODS) testing revealed the dynamic behavior of the pump rotor and the entire pump system. The results identified unsuspected excessive axial shuttling of the pump shaft at the motor running speed frequency due to axial run-out of the helical gear set. Based on the test results and supported by non-linear FEA analysis, the authors identified the root cause of the crack initiation phase of the shaft failure. An additional transient FEA based fracture mechanics analysis approach was able to predict that the stresses in the shaft, underneath the impeller, were able to encourage initiation and propagation of the crack. This lecture demonstrates the effectiveness in machinery root cause investigations of thorough vibration testing including ODS, EMA, and FEA rather than traditional troubleshooting approaches, which had not detected a gear/pump inter-related problem, and would not have provided such clear visual evidence for decision makers...|$|R
