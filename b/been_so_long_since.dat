25|$|The delays {{became so}} great that even ABC mocked the {{lateness}} with an ad campaign showing network executives waiting impatiently {{for the arrival of}} new episodes at ABC's corporate headquarters. One episode featured television critic Jeff Jarvis in an introduction, sarcastically reminding viewers {{what was going on with}} the show's plot since it had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> the last new episode.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 November 2008, {{two days}} after Barack Obama was elected the first black US President, Berlusconi {{referred}} to Obama as [...] "young, handsome and even tanned": On 26 March 2009 he said [...] "I'm paler , because it's <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I went sunbathing. He's more handsome, younger and taller." ...|$|E
2500|$|The narrator {{switches}} {{from the}} past to the present {{for the remainder of}} the song, describing the yearning that drives him to return to El Paso: [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I've seen the young maiden / My love is stronger than my fear of death." [...] Upon entering the town, he is attacked and fatally wounded by a posse. At the end of the song, the cowboy recounts that Feleena has [...] "found me,"and he dies in her arms.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since,</b> Captain Hatteraick,' {{answered}} Glossin, superciliously, 'that I really {{forget how}} I was recompensed for my trouble.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; perhaps, dear boy. But I {{could not}} begin alone; it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I rode. Perhaps {{when you come}} back from Ireland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good night!' {{repeated}} Guy, as he {{held her}} hand. 'It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I have had any one to wish me good night! Good night, mamma!' ...|$|R
60|$|Poor Sam looked forlorn, indeed, when {{he entered}} the apartment. It had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> his friend's last visit that he fancied they were deserting him.|$|E
60|$|DEAR MAJOR,--And has {{it come to}} {{this that}} the dead rise up and speak? For I {{supposed}} that you were dead, it has <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I heard your name.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I'd {{seen any}} soap an' water I'd known what they meant; but it's <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I {{was in a}} reg'lar house that I've kind'er forgot how to behave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is wonderfully beautiful," [...] she answered. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I <b>was</b> out of London {{that perhaps}} I {{appreciate}} it more, even, {{than either of}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{dinner that}} night he said to Hilda: [...] "I'm going to ask Amelia's brother down {{to spend a few}} days. It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> we have seen him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "DEAR MR. CLEMENS,--It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> Archibald Forbes and I [...] {{spent that}} {{pleasant}} afternoon in your comfortable house at [...] Hartford {{that you have}} probably quite forgotten the occasion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It has <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I saw you! It {{has seemed}} an eternity to me!" [...] Her answer came {{as quickly as}} even I could have wished; she spoke impulsively and without thought: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "S'pose {{we put it}} {{away for}} a while? It hasn't <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I ate that lot o' quails, you know; and I can hold on a spell, an' we'll be hungry before we're {{ready to go to}} sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, Vicomte, and I {{will go with}} you. Get my parasol, Susan. Perhaps {{you would}} like to come, too, Howard," [...] she added to Mr. Spence; [...] "it has <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> you were here, and we have made many changes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I cannot speak; I am {{agitated}} at meeting you,' {{she said}} with her native frankness. 'It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> we have <b>been</b> alone; and, as you say, all <b>is</b> <b>so</b> changed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I saw our {{beautiful}} {{mountains and}} I <b>was</b> then <b>so</b> young, that I feel a great impatience to revisit them, though the pleasure must be deferred until spring." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{not sure}} of that," [...] said Grant. [...] "Besides it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> we've <b>been</b> to church, that I feel as if I should enjoy it whether I {{understand}} it or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Waal," [...] {{said the}} driver, as he {{gathered}} the reins carefully in one hand, {{and seemed to}} be debating in his mind how he should answer the question, [...] "I don't know as I know myself, it's <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I've heard it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, gentlemen,' {{says the}} cigar man, 'I don't {{blame you for}} not wanting to play. I've {{forgotten}} the fine points of the game, I guess, it's <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I indulged. Now, {{how long are you}} gentlemen {{going to be in the}} city?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Call me {{what you}} please, good dame," [...] said the stranger; [...] "it has <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I heard any one call me by a name that sounded like former kindness, that such a one is more {{agreeable}} to me than a lord's title would be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well done, Jethro!" [...] Amuba shouted. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I <b>was</b> out hunting that I seem to {{have lost}} my skill; but it matters not since we have brought him down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} an anxious day, but this makes up for everything," [...] he said. [...] "Now--and it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I have seen you--can't we, {{for just a few}} minutes, forget our troubles?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] confessed Shaggy. [...] "I can not {{remember}} his looks very well, it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I have seen him; but all of our family are noted for their handsome faces." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{it really}} {{necessary}} {{to have such a}} blaze, or are you indulging in it simply because it has <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> we dared allow our whereabouts to be known?" [...] Teddy asked, as he sat with his chin on his knees gazing at the burning wood.|$|E
60|$|He obeyed {{the impulse}} to follow, and moved down the path, {{just out of reach}} of observation, he fancied. As he made way through the crowd he grew aware again of his heavy limbs, of his great height, of his swinging, useless hands. It had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> he had mingled with a holiday company, he {{appeared}} as self-conscious as a boy.|$|E
60|$|The hunters were snickering, but {{she looked}} at me with a sympathy in her eyes which more than {{compensated}} for Wolf Larsen’s nastiness. In truth, it had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I had received sympathy that I was softened, and I became then, and gladly, her willing slave. But I was angry with Wolf Larsen. He was challenging my manhood with his slurs, challenging the very legs he claimed to be instrumental in getting for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank thee, friend, {{for telling}} me this. 'Tis {{a joy to}} hear thee speak of Him. It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> we talked of this matter. And--tell me yet again--thou wast in Jerusalem when He died?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{so sorry}} Mrs. St. John Deloraine is out," [...] she said. [...] "She is at a soap-bubble party. I wish I could go. It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I saw any children, or had any fun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I {{read that}} {{particular}} book, sir," [...] returned the mate, diligently thumbing his watch-key, [...] "that I should be diffident about expressing an opinion. I think, however, a little Bible might do him good." ...|$|R
60|$|There was a love-feast, then. Captain Osborn {{ordered it}} {{regardless}} of expense, {{and he and}} Harte sat there and listened while the man told stirring adventures {{of his life and}} fed himself up to the eyebrows. Then Osborn wanted to be benefactor in his turn, and pay back some of his debt. The man said it could all be paid with ten dollars--that it had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> he had owned that amount of money that it would seem a fortune to him, and he should be grateful beyond words if the Captain could spare him that amount. The Captain spared him ten broad twenty-dollar gold pieces, and made him take them in spite of his modest protestations, and gave him his address and said he must never fail to give him notice when he needed grateful service.|$|E
6000|$|... "Kazor!" [...] {{cried the}} girl, {{and at the}} same moment the Alus came jabbering toward us. They made strange growling, barking noises, as with much baring of fangs they {{advanced}} upon us. They were armed only with nature's weapons--powerful muscles and giant fangs; yet I knew that these were quite sufficient to overcome us had we nothing better to offer in defense, and so I drew my pistol and fired at the leader. He dropped like a stone, and the others turned and fled. Once again the girl smiled her slow smile and stepping closer, caressed the barrel of my automatic. As she did so, her fingers came in contact with mine, and a sudden thrill ran through me, which I attributed {{to the fact that it}} had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I had seen a woman of any sort or kind.|$|E
60|$|The {{night was}} not indeed very far advanced, {{but it had}} <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> Shaws-Castle {{received}} a guest, that had Mowbray not heard the rolling of wheels in the court-yard, he might have thought rather of housebreakers than of visitors. But, {{as the sound of}} a carriage and horses was distinctly heard, it instantly occurred to him, that the guest must be Lord Etherington, come, even at this late hour, to speak with him on the reports which were current to his sister's prejudice, and perhaps to declare his addresses to her were at an end. Eager to know the worst, and to bring matters to a decision, he re-entered the apartment he had just left, where the lights were still burning, and, calling loudly to Patrick, whom he heard in communing with the postilion, commanded him to show the visitor to Miss Mowbray's parlour. It was not the light step of the young nobleman which came tramping, or rather stamping, through the long passage, and up the two or three steps at the end of it. Neither was it Lord Etherington's graceful figure which was seen when the door opened, but the stout square substance of Mr. Peregrine Touchwood.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am sure I {{shall be}} delighted to see him; it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I have seen a live man,' said Proserpine. 'Who can he be? A man, and a live man! How delightful! It must be a {{messenger}} from my mother.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Of course not,’ {{she says}} soothingly, ‘oh no, she canna be me’; but anon her real {{thoughts}} are {{revealed by the}} artless remark, ‘I doubt, though, {{this is a tough}} job you have on hand—it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> I <b>was</b> a bairn.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>'s</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>since</b> we parted, {{and we have}} so much to say to each other!" [...] Bernard exclaimed at last, and he {{accompanied}} this declaration with a laugh {{much more}} spontaneous than the one he had given a few moments before.|$|R
