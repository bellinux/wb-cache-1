5|$|The {{domestic}} political environment was further complicated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of Paul Eyschen, {{who had been}} Prime Minister for 27 years.

5|$|A {{by-election}} {{need not}} be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC triggered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> or resignation of an MP, {{even if there are}} no other minority candidates in that GRC, or any other reason.

Assuming that such a situation does arise, the Prime Minister would be obliged to call a by-election within a reasonable time, unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.|$|E
5|$|After his election, Hill {{appointed}} Parker to fill an 1885 vacancy on the New York Supreme Court created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of Justice Theodore R. Westbrook.

A stall made vacant <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of a {{military}} Knight Grand Cross is offered to the next most senior uninstalled military GCB, and similarly for vacancies among civil GCBs. Waits between admission to the Order and installation may be very long; for instance, Marshal of the Air Force Lord Craig of Radley was created a Knight Grand Cross in 1984, but was not installed until 2006.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of Dom Pedro in 1786, all the {{interior}} work was completed. This was fortunate, as {{from this period}} his widow's mental health deteriorated, until in 1794, she and her court took up official and full-time residence at Queluz. There the now completely insane Queen could be hidden from the view of her subjects. Her eldest son, later King João VI, was appointed Regent and ruled from Lisbon and the great palace at Mafra.|$|E
5|$|Despite having bested the Romans {{in their}} battles, Pyrrhus had {{sustained}} heavy casualties. With his Italian allies wavering, Pyrrhus decided {{to abandon his}} campaign against Rome. At this point in time, Pyrrhus had two options available. Firstly, he could return to Greece where the throne of Macedon had been left vacant <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of King Ptolemy Keraunos {{at the hands of}} the Gallic invaders of Greece. Pyrrhus had coveted the Macedonian throne and had briefly held it from 287 BC to 285 BC. Alternatively, he could respond to the appeal of the Greek poleis of Sicily which were requesting his assistance to combat Carthaginian aggression.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} grief caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> {{of her two}} children, Mary Shelley continued to study and read as she had throughout her life. Between 1818 and 1820, she exposed herself to {{quite a bit of}} drama. She read many of William Shakespeare's plays, some with Percy Shelley. Percy believed that Mary had a talent for drama and convinced her to study the great English, French, Latin, and Italian plays as well as drama theory. He even sought her advice regarding his play The Cenci. Less glamorously, Mary transcribed the manuscript of Percy's drama Prometheus Unbound. The Shelleys also attended operas, ballets, and plays.|$|E
5|$|Dom Pedro Afonso (19 July 1848– 10 January 1850) was the Prince Imperial and heir {{apparent}} {{to the throne}} of the Empire of Brazil. Born at the Palace of São Cristóvão in Rio de Janeiro, he was the second son and youngest child of Emperor Dom PedroII and Dona Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies, and thus {{a member of the}} Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza. Pedro Afonso was seen as vital to the future viability of the monarchy, which had been put in jeopardy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of his older brother Dom Afonso almost three years earlier.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, the FVdG was {{transformed}} from a localist union federation into a syndicalist labor organization with anarchist tendencies.

5|$|France was in {{constitutional}} crisis in 1830, which reached a peak in late July as the July Revolution began and riots erupted across Paris.

On 31July he decided to abandon the trip; abandoning his proposed onward journey to Brussels and Antwerp, he collected the five copies he had made in the Louvre and set off for London.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of the liturgical year on the first Sunday in Advent, Bach {{composed}} prolifically. He wrote works for three consecutive Sundays in Advent, prompted probably <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of the Kapellmeister Johann Samuel Drese on 1 December 1716. When Bach's hope to become Drese's successor was not realized, he ceased to compose cantatas for the Weimar court.|$|E
5|$|Full {{meetings}} of the Privy Council are held only when the reigning sovereign announces {{his or her own}} engagement (which last happened on 23 November 1839, in the reign of Queen Victoria); or when there is a demise of the Crown, either <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> or abdication of the monarch. A full meeting of the Privy Council was also held on 6 February 1811, when George, Prince of Wales was sworn in as Prince Regent by Act of Parliament. The current statutes regulating the establishment of a regency in the case of minority or incapacity of the sovereign also require any regents to swear their oaths before the Privy Council.|$|E
