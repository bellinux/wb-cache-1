5|$|The {{majority}} of discharges from hospice {{are due to}} the death of the patient, although hospice treatment may not end then as care also provides for a period of bereavement counseling for the family afterward. However, there are several other scenarios when a patient may <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> from hospice.|$|E
5|$|A {{patient may}} <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> by {{revocation}} {{if he or}} she chooses to relinquish the hospice benefit. Revocation could be due to hospitalization, if the patient chooses to pursue some type of curative treatment or experiences dissatisfaction with hospice care. However, not all hospitalizations of patients require revocation; should the admitting diagnosis to the hospital be unrelated to the condition for which they are in hospice, the patient may remain on hospice while undergoing treatment for it.|$|E
5|$|Between the 30th and the 1st, The Sun {{reported}} that the remaining strikers had declared they would not interfere, but were confident the company {{would be unable to}} find sufficient workers without them, and that by remaining united, they could yet see their terms met. Given notice to report to work on Monday, July 30 or <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> from the company, most chose discharge, but the company had little trouble in acquiring the workers needed to run the trains.|$|E
30|$|Hospital stays {{ranged from}} 15 to 48 h (mean 22.6 hours). Most {{patients}} (95.3 %) <b>were</b> <b>discharged</b> within 24 h, and 2.9 % <b>were</b> <b>discharged</b> within 48 h. The four {{patients who had}} a laparotomy (three with advanced endometriosis and one with primary tubal carcinoma) <b>were</b> <b>discharged</b> within 4 days (1.8 %).|$|R

25|$|On 30 October 2010, Eric <b>was</b> <b>discharged</b> from {{military}} service. Dong-wan <b>was</b> <b>discharged</b> on December 17 after serving 24 months as an administrative worker at the Seodaemun-gu District Office. Andy <b>was</b> <b>discharged</b> from active duty on October 31, 2011 from the Ministry of National Defense in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. Jun Jin <b>was</b> <b>discharged</b> on 14 November 2011, after {{working at the}} Gangnam Management Corporation, managing the culture center’s fitness club and parking lot. This was followed by Min-woo on March 2, 2012, after serving as a public service officer in Seoul Station.|$|R
5|$|However, because {{intravenous}} linezolid may be {{switched to}} an oral formulation (tablets or oral solution) without jeopardizing efficacy, people may <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> from hospital relatively early and continue treatment at home, whereas home treatment with injectable antibiotics may be impractical. Reducing {{the length of}} hospital stay reduces the overall cost of treatment, even though linezolid may have a higher acquisition cost—that is, {{it may be more}} expensive—than comparable antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E
5|$|According to the Court of Appeal, {{the burden}} of proof of {{justifying}} the lawfulness of the appellants' detention was, in the first instance, on the detaining authority. This burden of proof could <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> by evidence that the President, acting in accordance with advice of the Cabinet or an authorized minister, was satisfied that the detention was necessary for national security purposes, and by the production of the detention order. Once the detaining authority had discharged the initial burden of proof, a burden of proof fell on the appellants to challenge their detention on GCHQ grounds.|$|E

50|$|Fallon {{joined the}} 37th New York Infantry in May 1861, serving at the Battles of Williamsburg and Fair Oaks a year later.

Having <b>been</b> <b>discharged</b> a second time in May 1863, he joined the 35th New Jersey Infantry as a sergeant. He <b>was</b> <b>discharged</b> a third and final time in July 1865.|$|R
5|$|Care may be {{provided}} in a patient's {{home or in}} a designated facility, such as a nursing home, hospital unit or freestanding hospice, with level of care and sometimes location based upon frequent evaluation of the patient's needs. The four primary levels of care provided by hospice are routine home care, continuous care, general inpatient, and respite care. Patients undergoing hospice treatment may <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> {{for a number of}} reasons, including improvement of their condition and refusal to cooperate with providers, but may return to hospice care as their circumstances change. Providers are required by Medicare to provide to patients notice of pending discharge, which they may appeal.|$|E
5|$|Grant played football, basketball, and {{baseball}} at Superior Central High School (Wisconsin). He {{graduated from high}} school in 1945 and enlisted in the Navy during World War II. He was assigned to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station in Illinois and played on the football team coached by Paul Brown. Using an acceptance letter from the University of Wisconsin–Madison to <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> from the service, Grant decided to attend the University of Minnesota instead. He was a three-sport, nine-letterman athlete in football, basketball, {{and baseball}} for the Minnesota Golden Gophers, earning All-Big Ten honors in football twice.|$|E
5|$|Grissom {{enlisted in}} the United States Army Air Forces as an {{aviation}} cadet during World War II. As {{the end of the}} war neared, Grissom sought to <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> and married Betty Moore. Grissom enrolled at Purdue University, graduating with a bachelor's in mechanical engineering in 1950. He re{{enlisted in the}} United States Air Force, earning his pilot's wings in 1951. Grissom flew over 100 combat missions during the Korean War, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with an oak leaf cluster. He was reassigned to work as a flight instructor at Bryan Air Force Base. He attended the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology for a year and earned a bachelor's degree in aeromechanics.|$|E

5000|$|When Bill Rammell, the Secretary of State for Defence, {{was asked}} in {{parliament}} how many soldiers subject to manning control <b>are</b> (a) awaiting <b>discharge</b> and (b) have <b>been</b> <b>discharged</b> since 2007, he responded [...] "No soldiers have <b>been</b> <b>discharged</b> under Manning Control Points since 2002, and no soldiers are awaiting discharge".|$|R
5|$|On 7 August the Greater Bairam (a feast day {{celebrating the}} end of the Islamic year) coincided with the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps at Romani being ordered to move out with {{supplies}} for the advancing troops, but 150 men, most of whom were past {{the end of}} their contracts and entitled to <b>be</b> <b>discharged,</b> refused orders to fill their water bottles, draw their rations and saddle up. One man was hit about the head with the butt of a pistol and the dissenters were dispersed into small groups and reassigned to various units in the infantry division; the 52nd (Lowland) Division.|$|E
5|$|On December 27, 1880, Wyatt {{testified that}} White's {{shooting}} was accidental. Brocius expressed regret, {{saying he had}} not intended to shoot White. Gunsmith Jacob Gruber testified that Curly Bill's single-action revolver was defective, allowing it to <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> at half-cock. A statement from White before he died was introduced stating that the shooting was accidental. The judge ruled that the shooting was accidental and released Brocius. Brocius, however, remained intensely angry about how Wyatt had pistol-whipped him and became an enemy to the Earps. Virgil was also appointed acting town marshal of Tombstone.|$|E
5|$|Sing {{returned}} to Australia on submarine guard duty in late July 1918. An army medical report from 23 November 1918 {{noted that he}} had gunshot wounds in the left shoulder, back, and left leg, and had suffered gas poisoning. The report stated that his general health was 'good' but that he complained of coughing upon exertion. It recognised that Sing's disability {{were the result of}} service, was permanent, and recommended that he <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> as permanently unfit for service. Following his departure from the army, he briefly turned his hand to sheep farming, but the land he was given was of poor quality. He then worked as a gold miner.|$|E

5|$|The {{state of}} slavery is {{of such a}} nature, that it is {{incapable}} of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political; but only positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory: it's so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must <b>be</b> <b>discharged.</b>|$|E
5|$|A large press gang from Aigle, of {{more than}} 50 marines and sailors, led by Wolfe, put ashore in Portland on 2 April 1803. In {{what became known as}} the Easton Massacre, a scuffle broke out between the {{inhabitants}} and Wolfe's forces. Several civilians were shot and four were killed, while sixteen members of the press gang received injuries. Nine were wounded so seriously they had to <b>be</b> <b>discharged.</b> Wolfe and three officers stood trial for murder but were acquitted and left Portland, aboard Aigle, on 10 April to continue their patrol in home waters. Taking a French frigate, Franchise on 28 May, Aigle went on to capture six merchant vessels over the course of a week. A French privateer, Alerte, of 14 guns was taken on 27 September, off Vigo.|$|E
5|$|Disaster {{strikes at}} the press event. The craft {{apparently}} draws power from the broadcasting equipment, and its influence is magnified. The streets of London erupt into violence as those affected go on a rampage. Breen becomes drawn towards the craft and is killed. Quatermass falls under the alien control as well, but is snapped out of it by Roney, who is unaffected. The two men realise that {{a small portion of}} the population are immune. The psychic energy becomes stronger, ripping up streets and buildings, and the spectral image of a Martian towers above the city, centred on Hobbs End. Recalling stories about how the Devil could be defeated with iron and water, Roney theorises the Martian energy could <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> into the earth. Roney climbs to the top of a building crane and swings it into the spectre. The crane bursts into flames as it discharges the energy, killing Roney, but the image disappears.|$|E
50|$|From March 2015 to August 2017, {{four members}} have {{completed}} their mandatory military service. Sungmin enlisted for his service on 31 March 2015 and completed it on 30 December 2016. Eunhyuk enlisted for his service on 13 October 2015 and <b>was</b> <b>discharged</b> on 12 July 2017.

5|$|During the Civil War, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton {{promised a}} Medal of Honor to every {{man in the}} 27th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment who {{extended}} his enlistment beyond the agreed-upon date. The Battle of Gettysburg was imminent, and 311 men of the regiment volunteered to serve until the battle was resolved. The remaining men returned to Maine, but with the Union victory at Gettysburg the 311 volunteers soon followed. The volunteers arrived back in Maine in time to <b>be</b> <b>discharged</b> with {{the men who had}} earlier returned. Since {{there seemed to be no}} official list of the 311 volunteers, the War Department exacerbated the situation by forwarding 864 medals to the commanding officer of the regiment. The commanding officer only issued the medals to the volunteers who stayed behind and retained the others on the grounds that, if he returned the remainder to the War Department, the War Department would try to reissue the medals.|$|E
5|$|Grissom {{sought to}} <b>be</b> <b>{{discharged}}</b> {{as the war}} neared its end, and married Betty Moore on July 6, 1945. They married at the First Baptist Church in Mitchell while on leave, and his brother Norman served as his best man. He was discharged from the army in November 1945. Grissom {{took a job at}} Carpenter Body Works, a local bus manufacturing business, and rented an apartment in Mitchell. He had trouble earning a sufficient income and was determined to attend college. Using the G.I. Bill for partial payment of his school tuition, Grissom enrolled at Purdue University in September 1946. During his time in college, Betty returned to live with her parents and took a job at the Indiana Bell Telephone Company while he worked part-time as a cook at a local restaurant. Grissom took summer classes to finish early and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering in February 1950.|$|E
5|$|He re-embarked for England in June 1916, and re-joined his {{battalion}} on the Western Front in October. Once {{back with}} his battalion, he was accidentally wounded and then gassed, and was also promoted {{to the rank of}} lance corporal. In January 1918 he was awarded the Military Medal for bravery in the field, which involved rescuing a wounded man under fire. He was then promoted to corporal. During the capture of Merris in June, he killed an eight-man German machine gun crew, saving his platoon from annihilation, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. During this action he was severely wounded. He returned to Australia to <b>be</b> <b>discharged,</b> and was employed by the South Australian Railways over many years before dying in 1953, having suffered for years with bronchitis and emphysema. He was buried with full military honours in the AIF Cemetery, West Terrace. His medal set is displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial.|$|E
