40|$|Abstract—Clock jitter and {{its effects}} on {{signal-to-noise}} ratio (SNR) were widely investigated in the published literatures. However, most of the issues mainly focused on white-Gaussian-noise-only clock jitter, based on the scenario (assumption) of ideal interference-free clock circuit design which never existed in reality. This paper presents a realistic analog to digital converter (ADC) performance analysis model based on better realistic <b>circuit</b> <b>noise</b> conditions, particularly investigated on the clock jitter error with the combination of Gaussian <b>noise</b> and <b>circuit</b> <b>noise</b> (interference). An analytical expression for the A/D conversion with such combined clock jitter error is developed. The computer simulations are presented, which showed excellent agreement with the developed expression. Also, a real experiment is carried out to bring forth a comprehensive evaluation in A/D system design.

40|$|Variations in the power-distribution network are exacer-bated {{because of}} scaled supply {{voltages}} and smaller noise margins in sub-nanometer designs, which adversely affect performance and yield. Power-Supply noise incurred by excessive simultaneous switching of multiple paths negatively impacts {{the timing of}} a <b>circuit.</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>noise</b> is a major issue especially during transi-tion and delay test where test vectors cause increased switching as compared to functional operation resulting in increase in path delays. Test rejects due to excessive noise-induced failures during delay and transition test-ing negatively impacts yield. Hence {{there is a need}} to accurately characterize the resistive and inductive volt-age drop caused by excessive switching. To our knowl-edge, inductive drop has been excluded to simplify noise analysis. In our previous work, we have presented a convolution-based dynamic method (herein referred to as PSANDE) to estimate both IR and drop on small combinational and sequential circuits. In this paper we show that the effectiveness of the design parti-tioning technique makes the framework feasible for a larger design. Our dynamic approach involves selec-tively simulating only extracted switching logic which makes the run-time tractable as compared to prohibitive full-chip SPICE simulations. We also present data to show that PSANDE can accurately predict the power-supply noise due to clock tree switching. Data presented in this paper for power supply noise is based on a large ITCÕ 99 sequential benchmark b 17 circuit. with a maximum error of 8. 2 % in comparison to full-chip SPICE results...|$|R
