40|$|Thesis (M Development and Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 The <b>Blue</b> <b>Drop</b> Incentive-based Regulation (programme) was {{introduced}} in 2008 by the Department of Water Affairs (DWA) {{with the aim of}} maintaining and improving drinking water quality in South Africa. The programme is being implemented in order to protect consumers from water services providers who might not act {{in the interest of the}} public. For some years the confidence level of the public regarding the quality of drinking water in South Africa has not been at the desired level. The programme involves annual assessment of water services authorities by the DWA. In order for water services authorities to be awarded the <b>Blue</b> <b>Drop</b> status they are required to comply 95 % in terms of the criteria used in the assessments. During the first and second years of <b>Blue</b> <b>Drop</b> assessments a number of municipalities chose not to be assessed but quite a few achieved the <b>Blue</b> <b>Drop</b> status nationally. It is against this background that the researcher undertook a study to determine how water services employees in municipalities perceive the <b>Blue</b> <b>Drop</b> programme. To achieve the study objective the mixed method involving quantitative and qualitative methodologies was employed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with supervisors and management while water treatment works employees completed a survey questionnaire. The qualitative and quantitative data analysis brought to light the following core findings: * The <b>Blue</b> <b>Drop</b> programme has the support of the overwhelming majority of employees who participated in the research. They perceive the programme as an inspiration for improved performance of the water services function in municipalities. * There is a lack of or poor understanding of the water sector legal framework including the <b>Blue</b> <b>Drop</b> assessment criteria by some participating employees. * There is a perceived lack of management and political leadership involvement and support for the water service function. Although the <b>Blue</b> <b>Drop</b> programme has been reported to be an excellent intervention by nearly all the participants, there are certain aspects that can be improved and are dealt with in the last chapter of the mini-dissertation.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the impact of drinking water quality performance following the introduction of the <b>Blue</b> <b>Drop</b> Certification Programme as a mainstream regulation means to ensure that formal drinking water supplies comply with the South African National Standards. The <b>Blue</b> <b>Drop</b> Certification Programme is an innovative means to regulation which was designed and implemented with the core objective of safeguarding the tap water quality management. The study has focused on the drinking water quality performance with regard to microbiological, chemical, physical and operational compliance in the distribution system. Every effort should be made to achieve drinking water that is safe for human consumption by Water Suppliers. Safe drinking water, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines and SABS (SANS 241) does not represent any significant risk to health over a lifetime of consumption, including different sensitivities that may occur between life stages. Control of the microbial, chemical, physical and operational quality of drinking water requires the development of management plans. These plans should be implemented to provide the basis for system protection and process control to ensure that the number of pathogens and concentrations of chemicals present a negligible risk to public health and that water is acceptable to consumers. The study has reviewed drinking water quality performance following an introduction of the <b>Blue</b> <b>Drop</b> certification programme in the following municipalities; Tzaneen municipality within the Mopani District municipality, the Sekhukhune District municipality and the Tshwane Metropolitan municipality. The study has used the water quality determinands data available on the <b>Blue</b> <b>Drop</b> System (BDS). Chemical determinands analysis considered for the study is iron, sulfate, manganese, magnesium, arsenic, nitrate, sodium and calcium. Water quality determinands analyses considered for the study are conductivity, pH, turbidity, colour and odour, free chlorine. One-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) had been used to determine significant differences by comparing the water quality determinands data to determine the p-value in the period between 2010 and 2014 only of the selected determinands. If p-value is 0. 05 the study fails to reject H 0 – there is not enough evidence of significant difference. The study has noted significant improvement in terms of microbiological compliance from 2010 until 2014 within City of Tshwane. Some of the supply systems have maintained consistent microbiological, chemical, operational and physical compliance in the distribution system. The study also noted some decline in water quality on other water supply systems due to non-availability of the water quality data. The Department as a Regulator may have had an influence on strengthening of the drinking water compliance with the municipality to enable the water supply system to achieve the <b>Blue</b> <b>Drop</b> status.
