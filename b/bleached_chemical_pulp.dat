50|$|Folding boxboard, also {{referred}} to as FBB or by the DIN Standard 19303 codes of GC or UC, is a paperboard grade made up of multiple layers of chemical and mechanical pulp. This grade is made up of mechanical pulp in between two layers of chemical pulp.The top layer is of <b>bleached</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> with an optional pigment coating. This is a low-density material with high stiffness and has a slightly yellow colour, mainly on the inside. The major end uses of folding boxboard are health and beauty products, frozen, chilled and other foods, confectionaries, pharmaceuticals, graphical uses and cigarettes.|$|E
50|$|This {{grade is}} made purely from <b>bleached</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> and usually has a mineral or {{synthetic}} pigment coated top surface {{in one or}} more layers (C1S) and often also a coating on the reverse side (C2S). It is a medium density board with good printing properties for graphical and packaging end uses and is perfectly white both inside and out. It can easily be cut, creased, hot foil stamped and embossed. Its other properties, such as being hygienic and pure with no smell and taste, make it usable for packaging aroma and flavour sensitive products such as chocolate, cigarettes and cosmetics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>pulps,</b> such {{as those}} from the kraft process or sulfite pulping, contain much less lignin than {{mechanical}} pulps, (<5% compared to approximately 40%). The goal in <b>bleaching</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> is to remove essentially all of the residual lignin, hence the process {{is often referred to}} as delignification. Sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) was initially used to <b>bleach</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps,</b> but was largely replaced in the 1930s by chlorine. Concerns about the release of organochlorine compounds into the environment prompted the development of Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) and Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching processes.|$|R

50|$|A liquid {{packaging}} board {{might be}} up to five plies and is formed on a multi-ply paper machine with online coating. The most common is to use three plies with a basis weight of about 300 g/m2. The base or middle ply is normally made of pulp from bleached or unbleached chemical pulp, CTMP or broke (waste paper from a paper machine). CTMP gives more bulk and stiffness. The top ply (inside) is made of <b>bleached</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp.</b> The barrier coating depend of the application and might be applied on both sides. When induction welding is employed an aluminum foil layer is used for barrier protection and for heating.

In 2000, {{the first year of}} the new millennium, ECF production will be 53. 1 million tonnes, totaling more than two-thirds of the world market share. The transition to ECF is nearing completion. Market data show an ever-widening gap between ECF and TCF (Totally Chlorine-Free) production. ECF continues to grow at an annual rate of 10 % per year, with an additional 5 million tonnes entering the market in 2000. TCF remained steady at 6 - 7 % of world <b>bleached</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> production, with small net increase of 0. 1 million tonnes of production in 2000. Government organizations increasingly recognize and document ECF's proven pollution prevention record and acknowledge ECF as a component of Best Available Technology (BAT). Producers and users alike continue to desire ECF's superior product quality. With such strong government support and ECF's overall environmental integrity, its growth will continue...|$|E

Fibers {{were treated with}} various levels of dielectric-barrier discharge treatment ranging from 0 to 9. 27 kw/m 2 /min. Changes to the fiber surface topochemistry were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM studies were complemented by inverse gas chromatography (IGC), contact angle evaluation, poly-electrolyte titration, viscosity testing and determination of water retention value (WRV). The static coefficient of friction and zero-span tensile index of sheets were also evaluated. Low dielectric-barrier discharge treatment levels resulted in increased surface energy and roughness. Fibers treated at high applied power levels showed surface energies and roughness levels near that of reference samples as well as evidence of degradation and decreased fiber swelling.

50|$|Alkaline {{hydrogen}} peroxide {{is the most}} commonly used bleaching agent for mechanical pulp. The amount of base such as sodium hydroxide is less than that used in <b>bleaching</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> and the temperatures are lower. These conditions allow alkaline peroxide to selectively oxidize non-aromatic conjugated groups responsible for absorbing visible light. The decomposition of {{hydrogen peroxide}} is catalyzed by transition metals, and iron, manganese and copper are of particular importance in pulp bleaching. The use of chelating agents like EDTA to remove some of these metal ions from the pulp prior to adding peroxide allows the peroxide to be used more efficiently. Magnesium salts and sodium silicate are also added to improve bleaching with alkaline peroxide.|$|R

The beating degree of pulp seemed to have an insignificant effect on the conductivity of PAn-coated conductive paper.

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{two issues}} {{relevant to the}} bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass. The first part relates to the accessibility of cellulose in wood, more specifically, the impact of initial drying on wood ultrastructure. The second part of this thesis pertains to the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose, including a characterization of a model film of amorphous cellulose and its subsequent utilization in a fundamental evaluation of the mechanism of cellulase action. In addition, the impact of cellulase treatment on the properties and the morphology of wood pulp fibers was evaluated. The impact of drying on the ultrastructure of fresh wood was studied by deuterium exchange coupled with FT-IR analysis. Initially, the experimental concept and its reliability were evaluated using fresh wood samples. The same experimental concept was then applied to study the impact of initial drying on wood pulps of different characteristics and composition. The objective was to correlate the trends in drying-induced alterations observed for wood and for pulps, <b>bleached</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> in particular. Drying-induced alterations of a native wood sample exhibited a remarkable similarity to those observed for wood pulp samples. The {{results suggest that the}} supramolecular rearrangements in the native wood matrix upon dehydration are qualitatively identical to the well-known changes occurring in pulp fibers after drying, although the changes are considerably different in quantity. Quantitative studies of cellulose degradation by cellulase enzymes were carried out using an amorphous cellulose model film with well-defined characteristics. First, the films were extensively characterized, particularly their crystalline nature and swelling behavior. The film swelled excessively in water, doubling its thickness, but returned to the original thickness upon water removal, while retaining its amorphous nature. This film was then used as a substrate in studying the action of monocomponent endoglucanase (EG) that acts on amorphous cellulose. The study was carried out using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCMD). The main objectives were to study the impact of film thickness on the rate of hydrolysis and to directly quantify the extent of hydrolysis (decrease in thickness of films after hydrolysis). It was demonstrated that the amount of substrate available for hydrolysis did not {{have an impact on the}} rate of hydrolysis. The investigation also demonstrated impacts of various factors on the kinetic evaluation of the cellulase action. The investigation of the action of a commercial celobiohydrolase on wood pulp fibers showed that the treatment had no significant impact on the strength properties of the pulp.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{application}} of polyelectrolyte complexes (PEC) to different pulps, to improve the strength of papers produced from them, is compared with conventional pulp beating. The pulps chosen for the investigation were a fully <b>bleached</b> <b>chemical</b> hardwood <b>pulp</b> (HBK), a fully <b>bleached</b> <b>chemical</b> softwood <b>pulp</b> (SBK), and a peroxide-bleached chemi-thermomechanical pulp (BCTMP). The polyelectrolytes used were a polyamideamine epichlorohydrine condensate (PAE), traditionally used as a wet-strength additive, and carboxymethylcellulose. Since the complexes prepared from these chemicals bear an anionic charge, they can only be used after fibre pre-treatment with the cationic PAE. Results indicate that the addition of 2 % PAE and 2 % PEC can improve all the measured tensile strength properties of the sheets as much as is commonly achieved by mechanically beating the pulps. In fact, for the <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps,</b> PEC addition at the chosen level produced better results than did traditional beating, since the improved tensile index and tensile energy absorption could be achieved without any significant deterioration in the light scattering coefficient of the papers produced. However, with the BCTMP {{a significant decrease in}} light scattering could be detected, especially following the addition of PEC. Adding the chemicals (especially the PEC) increased the sheet density, so chemical treatment left the bending stiffness of the sheets unaffected. However, based on the results, it was suggested that a combination of unbeaten HBK and BCTMP treated with PAE and PEC should be used as the fibre components of a typical fine paper furnish...|$|R

The three natural fiber types include <b>bleached</b> softwood <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> (softwood), <b>bleached</b> hardwood <b>chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> (hardwood), and <b>bleached</b> softwood chemithermomechanical pulp (BCTMP). Gas holdup is recorded over a range of fiber mass fractions (0 ≤ C ≤ 1. 6 %) and superficial gas velocities (Ug ≤ 23 cm/s). Experimental results show that gas holdup decreases with increasing fiber mass fraction. Homogeneous, transitional, and heterogeneous flow is observed for all three fiber types at low fiber mass fractions. All three fiber types produce similar results in the homogeneous flow regime while significant differences are recorded in the heterogeneous flow regime; those being low mass fraction hardwood (softwood) fiber slurries produce the highest (lowest) gas holdup. At higher fiber mass fractions, only pure heterogeneous flow is observed and softwood fiber slurries still produce the lowest gas holdup, although the differences in gas holdup between fiber types are small.

40|$|BACKGROUNDBrightness {{stability}} of <b>bleached</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> is {{often associated with}} the final bleaching stages that should provide the removal of chromogenic species responsible for brightness reversion without compromising the papermaking potential. Aiming at promoting higher brightness stability, a partially bleached Eucalyptus globulus pulp (DED) of c. 88 % ISO brightness was involved in a study of a final enzymatic stage (X) alternative to conventional chlorine dioxide (D) and hydrogen peroxide (P) bleaching stages (DEDX vs. DEDD and DEDX vs. DEDP). X stage was also applied before and after the final P or D stages (DEDDX/DEDXD and DEDPX/DEDXP) to produce high brightness pulps (c. 91 %). RESULTSX stage with xylanase Pulpzyme HC allowed an increase of c. 1. 5 % in pulp brightness while decreasing the brightness reversion and a concomitant pulp yield loss of only 0. 5 %. Significant chemical savings were obtained in the final D (70 %) or P (45 %) stages to achieve targeted final brightness of c. 91 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Brightness {{stability}} {{is a key}} property of <b>bleached</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> and is primarily determined by wood species and bleaching process conditions. Eucalyptus globulus is becoming a very important raw material for hardwood pulp production. In spite of this importance, there is a relative lack of systematic studies in the literature dealing with the subject. This research aims to study the effect {{of some of the}} foremost bleaching parameters of a DEDD bleaching sequence as well as the effect of a final P stage (DEDP instead of DEDD) in the brightness stability of bleached E. globulus kraft pulps. RESULTS: The increase of the Do stage temperature from 55 degrees C to 90 degrees C caused an increase in brightness stability. Increasing the ClO 2 charges from 2. 8 % to 3. 2 % also improved significantly the brightness stability. A high H 2 SO 4 charge in the D- 0 stage (10 kg tonne(- 1) pulp) diminished the brightness stability. The combination of H 2 O 2 addition to the E stage and ClO 2 reduction in the two final D stages does not affect brightness reversion. Raising the D- 2 stage temperature from 65 degrees C to 82 degrees C decreased the brightness reversion, while an increase was obtained when the temperature rose above 82 degrees C. Substitution of the last ClO 2 stage in the DEDD sequence by a H 2 O 2 stage (DEDP) significantly reduced the brightness reversion. CONCLUSION: For an existing pulp mill in which the implementation of new technologies to improve brightness reversion is considered, the results obtained showed that brightness stability can be improved without any significant capital investment.

40|$|Ultraviolet {{resonance}} Raman spectroscopy (UVRRS) {{was applied}} to determine the characteristic vibrations of several monomeric and dimeric lignin model compounds. The characteristic vibrations of p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl, and syringyl lignin structures were then detected in the UVRR spectra of extracted wood samples. Further, a partial least squares (PLS) model was developed to assist {{the determination of the}} characteristic UVRR bands of different lignin structures. The UVRRS-PLS method was further applied to interpret the more complex lignin spectra. The results correlated well with the results obtained by Py-GC/FID for the quantification of guaiacyl and syringyl lignin structures and with results obtained by NMR spectroscopy for the quantification of condensed lignin structures in guaiacyl-type lignin. Chromophoric lignin structures were studied by exciting pulp samples in the visible range. The overwhelming fluorescence emission was suppressed by applying a carbon disulfide (CS 2) based Kerr gate technique. The fluorescence rejection ratio was estimated to be as high as 250. Chromophores in chlorine dioxide and peroxide bleached pulps were of different nature, as indicated by the different correlations with brightness and kappa number. Residual lignin and hexenuronic acids in the unbleached and <b>bleached</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> were quantified with PLS calibration and with direct band height ratios. PLS calibration gave relatively good predictions, while the direct band height ratio was more a straightforward method. The band height ratio method is not, however, applicable to unbleached pulps with lignin contents of about 5 % because in these pulps the cellulose bands are indiscernible and cannot be used as a reference band. Carbonyl groups in cellulosic pulps were studied by the UVRRS and by the CCOA (carbazole- 9 -carbonyloxyamine) method, which showed that part of the carbonyls exist in hydrate, hemiacetal and/or hemiketal forms. It was also shown that these structures interconvert upon drying and wetting of the pulps.
