5|$|After nearly 30 {{years of}} {{struggling}} with funding and pursuing various deals, William Beardsley hired engineer Carl Pleasant {{to assist with}} designing. Pleasant recommended hiring the engineer firm Peckham and James to draft plans for the storage dam at the Frogs Tank site. The gravity dam design was dropped, and a relatively new, cheaper and improved <b>but</b> <b>controversial</b> design was adopted: the multiple-arch buttress dam. In 1925, under a new state law, Beardsley was able to create the Beardsley-Agua Fria Water Conservation District. Under the new district, funds could be raised through a bond issue. On December 20, 1925, the construction contract was signed, but the bonds {{had yet to be}} purchased. Five days before the contract was signed, Beardsley died. His son, Robert took direction of the project along with Pleasant. In early 1926, Pleasant eventually sold the needed bonds to the New York firm Brandon, Gordon and Waddell. The firm sent Donald Ware Waddell to oversee construction.|$|E
5|$|The Tyler-Texas {{treaty was}} in its final stages when its chief architects, Secretary Upshur and Secretary of the Navy Thomas W. Gilmer, died in an {{accident}} aboard USS Princeton on February 28, 1844, just a day after achieving a preliminary treaty draft agreement with the Texas Republic. The Princeton disaster proved a major setback for Texas annexation, in that Tyler expected Secretary Upshur to elicit critical support from Whig and Democratic Senators during the upcoming treaty ratification process. Tyler selected John C. Calhoun to replace Upshur as Secretary of State and to finalize the treaty with Texas. The choice of Calhoun, a highly regarded <b>but</b> <b>controversial</b> American statesman, risked introducing a politically polarizing element into the Texas debates, but Tyler prized him as a strong advocate of annexation.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} the word 'Naga' is also unclear.

Both naka and naga are pronounced {{the same way in}} Burmese. The ancient name of Nagaland is 'Nakanchi' or 'Naganchi', derived from the Naga language.|$|E
25|$|Introduced in 1978, {{and given}} legal backing in 1979 and 1980, Operation Barga became a popular <b>but</b> <b>controversial</b> measure for land reforms.

To date, Op Barga has recorded the names of approximately 1.5million bargadars. Since then, it has been marked as one of the more successful land reforms programs in India.|$|E

25|$|After the lying-in-state and {{funeral of}} the popular <b>but</b> <b>controversial</b> Pope Pius X, {{cardinals}} assembled for the conclave {{at the end of}} August 1914. One major difference with earlier conclaves was that this time no secular monarch claimed a veto over whomever the cardinals could select as pope, as a result of legislation promulgated by Pius X, that established that whosoever attempted to introduce a veto in the conclave would incur automatic excommunication. For the first time in centuries the cardinals alone would make the choice.|$|E
25|$|During {{his tenure}} as Army Chief of Staff, Shinseki {{initiated}} an innovative <b>but</b> <b>controversial</b> plan to make the Army more strategically deployable and mobile in urban terrain by creating Stryker Interim-Force Brigade Combat Teams. He conceived a long term strategic plan for the Army dubbed Objective Force, which included a program he designed, Future Combat Systems. One other controversial plan that Shinseki implemented was the wearing of the black beret for all Army personnel. Prior to Shinseki implementing this policy, only the United States Army Rangers could wear the black beret. When the black beret was given to all soldiers and officers, the Rangers moved to the tan beret.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Germans fled or were {{expelled from the}} present-day Polish and Czech parts of Silesia during and after World War II. From June 1945 to January 1947, 1.77 million Germans were expelled from Lower Silesia, and 310,000 from Upper Silesia. Today, most German Silesians and their descendants live in {{the territory of the}} Federal Republic of Germany, many of them in the Ruhr area working as miners, like their ancestors in Silesia. To smooth their integration into West German society after 1945, they were placed into officially recognized organizations, like the Landsmannschaft Schlesien, with financing from the federal West German budget. One of its most notable <b>but</b> <b>controversial</b> spokesmen was the Christian Democratic Union politician Herbert Hupka.|$|E

25|$|Being at the {{forefront}} of Indian politics for decades, Gandhi left a powerful <b>but</b> <b>controversial</b> legacy on Indian politics. The main legacy of her rule was destroying internal party democracy in the Congress party. Her detractors accuse her of weakening State chief ministers and thereby weakening the federal structure, weakening independence of judiciary, and turning the cabinet into a joke by vesting power in her secretariat and her sons. Gandhi is also associated with fostering a culture of nepotism in Indian politics and in India's institutions. She is also almost singularly associated with the period of Emergency rule and the dark period in Indian Democracy that it entailed. Her actions in storming the Golden Temple alienated Sikhs for a very long time. She remains the only woman ever to occupy the office of the Prime Minister of India.|$|E
25|$|In September 1920 Maklakov {{visited the}} Crimea to meet Pyotr Wrangel and other White Russian leaders. This {{was his last}} visit to Russia. Later he assumed control {{of a network of}} offices Russes that {{certified}} marriages and births of Russian émigrés throughout France and performed other work normally undertaken by the consulates. Despite encroaching deafness, Maklakov remained {{at the helm of the}} Russian Emigration Office (eventually subsumed into the structure of Charles de Gaulle's government) until his death at the age of 88. His front-rank reputation and talent for mediation allowed Maklakov (rather than the better known <b>but</b> <b>controversial</b> figures like Kerensky and Miliukov) to manoeuvre between the many warring factions that made up the Russian émigré community and to represent their interests in dealing with the French government. He also wrote several books on the history of social thought and the Russian liberal movement.|$|E
25|$|N. D. Cocea (common {{rendition}} of Nicolae Dumitru Cocea, , {{also known as}} Niculae, Niculici or Nicu Cocea; November 29, 1880 – February 1, 1949) was a Romanian journalist, novelist, critic and left-wing political activist, known as a major <b>but</b> <b>controversial</b> figure {{in the field of}} political satire. The founder of many newspapers and magazines, including Viața Socială, Rampa, Facla and Chemarea, collaborating with writer friends such as Tudor Arghezi, Gala Galaction and Ion Vinea, he fostered and directed the development of early modernist literature in Romania. Cocea later made his name as a republican and anticlerical agitator, was arrested as an instigator during the 1907 peasant revolt, and played a leading role in regrouping the scattered socialist clubs. His allegiances however switched between parties: during World War I, he supported the Entente Powers and, as a personal witness of the October Revolution, the government of Soviet Russia, before returning home as a communist.|$|E

25|$|Leigh Hunt (1784-1859) was an English man of letters—a poet, {{political}} commentator, drama critic, literary critic, translator, and essayist. The {{center of}} a literary circle including the poets Byron, Shelley, and Keats, and the essayists Charles Lamb and Hazlitt himself, he exerted an influence on and was an avid promoter of all of them. Hunt began to gain notice in 1808, when, {{as editor of the}} radical periodical The Examiner, and a valiant advocate of liberty, free speech, and political reform, he attracted a wide audience; he gained even more attention in 1813 when his outspoken criticism of the Prince Regent landed him in prison. In 1816, Hunt published his innovative <b>but</b> <b>controversial</b> narrative poem The Story of Rimini. It drew many enthusiastic admirers, but its theme of forbidden love provided Hunt's political foes with an instrument to chastise him, and from then on Hunt's reputation was sharply split along political lines.|$|E
25|$|Born {{the second}} son of Captain Roger Curtis {{and his wife}} Jane Sarah Brady, Curtis joined the Royal Navy in June 1795, by which time his father was an admiral and a senior <b>but</b> <b>controversial</b> figure in the Admiralty. He was {{appointed}} to the first-rate HMS Queen Charlotte in the Channel Squadron and then, having been promoted to midshipman, transferred to the second-rate HMS Prince also in the Channel Squadron in August 1798. Promoted to lieutenant on 11 August 1801, he joined the third-rate HMS Lancaster, flagship of the Cape of Good Hope Station, later that month. In 1802, Curtis' elder brother, also named Roger, died suddenly in naval service: as the remaining son, Curtis received strong patronage due to his family links. He transferred to the third-rate HMS Excellent in September 1803 and, having been promoted to commander on 16 November 1804, became commanding officer of the sloop HMS Jalouse in the Mediterranean Fleet later that month and then commanding officer of the sloop HMS Rose in June 1805.|$|E
