40|$|The {{model of}} the stock/roll {{interface}} during rolling is usually a micro-part of a more complex macro-finite-element model. Corresponding linking of modelling scales is a necessary stage for numerical analysis of fine mechanisms of the interface formation. These, for example, can include behaviour of thin oxide scales and formation of a few micron thick stock surface layers during hot rolling. The micro scale model {{has the capacity to}} include very fine features of the interface such as roll asperities, multi-layer scales, voids or a complicated profile of the scale/metal interface. Simulations of the reheating and <b>breakdown</b> <b>rolling</b> of the Al-Mg-Mn aluminium alloy AA 3104 carried out at the University of Sheffield using a two-high laboratory mill were supported by detailed numerical modelling of the stock surface layer formation. To link ‘macro-’ and ‘micro-’ scales of the modelling, the micro-model was reduced to a small segment of the stock-roll interface. The boundary conditions for the small segment were taken from the macro-model. The FE mesh near the interface was then refined as required; the origin of coordinates was changed by tying it to one of the segment nodes and, finally, asperities and grinding defects on the roll surface were introduced onto the roll surface. This procedure allowed for consideration of the fine mechanisms responsible for formation of the scale/metal interface while, at the same time, reducing the number of elements under consideration. Examination of the specimens using glow discharge optical emission spectrometry revealed that the reheating induced significant Mg enrichment in the surface and near surface regions and that Mg diffusion and oxidation continued throughout the reheating. The results of the experimental examinations obtained for the laboratory samples indicated that the level of Mg in the near surface regions of the rolled specimen was of an order of magnitude less than that observed in the reheated specimens. Further analysis including the multi-scale numerical modelling indicated that, under the rolling conditions used, the fall in Mg content arose mainly due to the removal of some of the thin oxide layer by abrasion and adhesion to the work roll surface. In addition a small amount of Mg (as oxides) was intermixed into the subsurface layer of a few microns depth by deformation during rolling. It is thought that the mechanisms which led to the deformation and mixing of the oxide particles into the subsurface layer arose from slip at the roll/stock interface and the action of roll surface asperities on the stock surface...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{employing}} the finite element method (FEM) to simulate hot flat rolling process. The relevant work involves selecting a suitable constitutive equation, predicting the rolling load and roll torque, computing temperature changes and lateral deformation, simulating the evolution of substructure, modelling static recrystallisation and designing the rolling pass schedule. A practical pass schedule supplied by an aluminium company and containing reliable measured data of roll load and torque is analysed by a commercial 3 -D thermornechanical coupled FEM program FORGE 3 V 5. 3. The inverse analysis method is adopted to obtain the friction coefficient and heat transfer coefficient. The distribution of pressure, equivalent strain, the stress and damage in the roll gap in <b>breakdown</b> <b>rolling</b> are discussed. The changes of temperature and lateral profile under both laboratory and industrial rolling conditions are computed and compared with experimental measurements, the differences are then investigated. Through applying the Taguchi experimental design method, the influence of each rolling parameter on the spread, i. e. the ratio of width to thickness, the roll radius to thickness, the thickness reduction, and the deformation temperature, the relative contribution of each control parameter is quantitatively estimated and expressed as a percentage. A new spread formula is built up based on {{a large amount of}} FE analyses. The new formula is able to deal with both laboratory and industrial rolling conditions with high accuracy. Critical reviews are presented for the previous work in the modelling of subgrain size and static recrystallisation. Both empirical and physical models are applied to investigate the evolution of subgrain size, dislocation density, misorientation and the flow stress in the roll gap. The predicted subgrain size agrees very well with the experimental measurement. The difference between the use of two models are illustrated and analysed. Studies on modelling of static recrystallisation are carried out by incorporating the plastomechanical parameters, i. e. strain, strain rate and temperature, into empirical model. Various approaches are proposed to reduce the predicted volume fraction recrystallised at the surface and are verified by the comparison with measurement. Simulation results show that some of the previous work reported in the literature are erroneous. Further work in the modelling of static recrystallisation and texture evolution is detailed. The Taguchi experimental method is also applied to study the influence of the rolling parameters on the fraction recrystallised (Xv). The study shows that rolling temperature has the greatest influence on the Xv, followed by the parameter H. 1 L. The roll temperature and roll speed have little influence on the Xv. Designing a rational rolling pass schedule is critical for the control of strip profile and product quality. In the present thesis, the procedure of designing a rolling pass schedule is illustrated. The formulae used in scheduling are listed and explained. The scheduling program is then performed to check with two existing industrial schedules. The comparison shows that the rolling load, temperature and power model is reliable and shows high accuracy. A multipass simulation by the use of finite element method is also carried out and the results are compared with various model predictions. The problems in the simulation are illustrated and explained...|$|E

At present, a lot of advanced technologies, modern equipment and devices, which “recognizes” faulty axle-boxes when the train is in motion, have been implemented. However, the timely identification of <b>breakdown</b> of <b>rolling</b> stock axle-boxes still is an acute problem, the initial stage of damage emergence being especially problematic. Presently, <b>rolling</b> stock axle-box <b>breakdown</b> is determined according to the higher than permissible temperature of the axle-box body. The article provides statistical data of dangerously heated axle-boxes, determined train delay durations, the number of delayed trains by danger level, and dependence of damage on the season. After systematization of data on axle-box damage and heating temperatures of broken axle-boxes, heating tendencies of axle-boxes of freight wagons are described.

The relationship among the vortex <b>breakdown</b> location, <b>rolling</b> moment coefficient and roll angle are developed. The proposed model, in fact, integrates the vortex breakdown location on the delta wing surface into the delta wing roll dynamics for control purposes. Different parameter identification methods have been applied to approximate the uncertainties of the nonlinear dynamic model, such as rolling moment coefficient. Experimental results validate the proposed model. I...|$|R

40|$|Workshop Abstract. Dynamic {{production}} scheduling (DPS) is usually trigged by uncertain disturbances such as emergency orders, machine <b>breakdown</b> and <b>rolling</b> planning horizon etc. DPS is a challenging problem in real-life industry manufacturing field {{due to its}} bulky problem scalability, which is more significant in discrete manufacturing industry. This industry features multi-specifications, small batch and customization production pattern {{in terms of its}} production characteristics and workshop scheduling algorithm whose multi-product series are subject to complexity, multi- various constrains, multi-dynamic objectives and uncertainties. In order to card this research direction, this paper reviews it given different disturbances including emergency orders, machine breakdown, tardiness of job, and engineering changes. Moreover, currently common advantages and disadvantages of dynamic scheduling algorithm are laid stress on. Accordingly, characteristics and future research direction of it are presented. For different disturbances, corresponding algorithm solutions are categorized and reviewed.

40|$|Abstract: All {{over the}} India, {{most of the}} {{processing}} industries are involved with rolling operations for steel and alloyed materials. To perform these operations, rolling mills are used. But maintenance of such rolling mills is a tedious job, because these rolling mills work under certain critical conditions such as frequent load variations, higher temperatures etc. Hence, every component bears load variations, which results in wear and tear of components. This causes frequent <b>breakdowns</b> of <b>rolling</b> mill components. Thus, it involves lot of maintenance cost, loss of production time, more number of workforces to perform maintenance action etc. One such rolling mill, which is situated in Hingna MIDC, Nagpur is taken {{as a case study}} in the present work. This rolling mill uses preventive and break-down maintenance strategies. But, these strategies seem to be inadequate. To reduce the losses, a new logic along with a new maintenance technique is suggested through this present work. This maintenance technique is nothing but “vibration based condition monitoring”, which is discussed with following articles...|$|R
40|$|Transporting coal {{by means}} of {{conveyor}} belts is common in Australian underground coal mines. Major conveyor belt–related mining incidents are now relatively infrequent {{as a result of}} recent improvements in engineering standards and the use of fire-resistant materials. However, conveyor belts are still a potential cause of personal and structural damage. In addition, any unexpected <b>breakdown</b> of <b>rolling</b> components or failure of belts creates a significant interruption to production, which is a major concern for operators, who are responsible for achieving optimum mining production. This project aimed to develop a fibre optic–based distributed temperature sensing (DTS) system to monitor the temperature change of malfunction idlers for heavy-duty conveyor belts in underground coal mines. Specifically, the objective of the project was to investigate various installation options for fibre-optic cable along the conveyor belt in order to identify the most effective design. The project was consisted of site trials and laboratory experiments to examine the performance of the DTS system for different cable installation designs and to characterise the behaviour of the DTS system...|$|R

40|$|The unsteady, three-dimensional, full Navier-Stokes (NS) {{equations}} and the Euler equations of rigid-body dynamics are sequentially solved {{to simulate}} the natural rolling response of slender delta wings of zero thickness at moderate to high angles of attack, to transonic and subsonic flows. The governing equations of fluid flow and dynamics of the present multi-disciplinary problem are solved using the time-accurate solution of the NS equations with the implicit, upwind, Roe flux-difference splitting, finite-volume scheme and a four-stage Runge-Kutta scheme, respectively. The main focus is to analyze the effect of Mach number and angle of attack {{on the leading edge}} vortices and their <b>breakdown,</b> the resultant <b>rolling</b> motion, and overall aerodynamic response of the wing. Three cases demonstrate the natural response of a 65 deg swept, cropped delta wing in a transonic flow with breakdown of the leading edge vortices and an 80 deg swept delta wing in a subsonic flow undergoing either damped or self-excited limit-cycle rolling oscillations as a function of angle of attack.
