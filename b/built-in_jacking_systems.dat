50|$|The SB {{launched}} at the October 1933 London Motor Show {{had a new}} cruciform braced chassis, {{slightly longer}} at 124 in, with independent front suspension using a single transverse leaf spring with a long solid anchorage in the centre. Steering was improved using new designs employed for racing Alvis cars since 1925. Road shocks were not transmitted from one wheel to the other nor did they affect {{the steering wheel and}} the gyroscopic effect was eliminated. Rear springs damped by Hartford Telecontrol dampers are long and underslung. The engine remained the same but the new all-silent gearbox, the first of its type, gained synchromesh on bottom gear and was mounted separately from the engine. A <b>built-in</b> <b>jacking</b> <b>system</b> was fitted as standard.|$|R
50|$|Following on from {{previous}} designs of London taxi, the FX3 had a traditional 3-door body, {{with an open}} luggage platform rather than a front passenger seat beside the driver. The FX3 was fitted with mechanical brakes, with rod operation, beam axles on leaf springs and a <b>built-in</b> Jackall hydraulic <b>jacking</b> <b>system.</b> Like all London taxis, it has a tight turning circle of 25 ft (7.6m) diameter, {{as required by the}} Conditions of Fitness.|$|R
5000|$|Whilst it used a {{brand new}} 4-cylinder 2199 cc, overhead-valve engine—the first {{to be used in}} an Austin car, it in fact used the chassis and body of the pre-war Austin 12, which {{continued}} to be produced, alongside the other pre-war saloons the 8 hp and the 10 hp. The number Sixteen was not an indication of the actual power output of the engine but rather the result of a calculation used to determine the excise duty (road tax) payable for the vehicle. The engine in fact produced [...] at 3800 rpm. The car shared a number of features with the famed London Taxi, one of which was the <b>built-in</b> hydraulic <b>jacking</b> <b>system</b> operated from a pump located under the bonnet.|$|R
50|$|Only 13 Divans (including the two prototypes) {{were ever}} built, of which 12 have survived. The car {{featured}} aircraft-inspired styling details {{as well as}} disc brakes, hidden headlights, and <b>built-in</b> <b>jacks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The basic {{function}} of a trailer jack is to lift the trailer to a height that allows the trailer to be hitched or unhitched {{to and from the}} towing vehicle. Trailer jacks are also used for leveling the trailer during storage. The most common types of trailer jacks are A-frame jacks, swivel jacks, and drop-leg jacks. Some trailers, such as horse trailers, have a <b>built-in</b> <b>jack</b> at the tongue for this purpose.|$|R

50|$|Designed by the Sumida firm, the M.2593 was {{produced}} beginning in 1933 at the Ishikawajima Motor Works. A defining {{feature of this}} vehicle is that its six road wheels could be exchanged for flanged railway wheels. When not in use, the tires would be secured {{to the sides of}} the hull. The vehicle had four <b>built-in</b> <b>jacks</b> for use when the wheels were changed. It would take ten to twenty minutes to change the wheels. The front and rear sets of wheels could even be adjusted to various rail gauges. The car was capable of 25 mph (40 km/h) on road and traveling at higher speeds on rails, going up to 37 mph (60 km/h).|$|R

50|$|The KLG Sparking Plug {{distribution}} {{rights were}} purchased from Kenelm Lee Guinness in 1919. The British Jaeger Instrument Company was purchased in 1927 {{as was the}} KLG Sparking Plug Company (Robinhood Engineering). The Jackall hydraulic <b>jacking</b> <b>system</b> was manufactured from 1935 by Smith's <b>Jacking</b> <b>Systems</b> and immediately became standard equipment in many popular cars. In 1937 a separate aircraft and marine department {{was created in the}} parent company and named Smiths Aircraft Instruments. It operated with Smiths subsidiary Henry Hughes and Son manufacturers of aircraft and marine instruments. In 1946, Smiths and the Ingersoll Watch Company founded the Anglo-Celtic Watch Co.

40|$|Efficient {{methods for}} {{simulating}} operators performing part handling tasks in manufacturing plants are needed. The simulation of part handling motions {{is an important}} step towards the implementation of virtual manufacturing for the purpose of improving worker productivity and reducing injuries in the workplace. However, industrial assembly tasks are often complex and involve multiple interactions between workers and their environment. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a series of industrial simulations using the Human Motion Simulation Framework developed at the University of Michigan. Three automotive assembly operations spanning scenarios, such as small and large parts, tool use, walking, re-grasping, reaching inside a vehicle, etc. were selected. A conceptual model for describing relationships among task objectives, the environment, parts and tools, as well as worker variability, work methods, motion patterns, and musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) risks is proposed as a structure for conducting the case studies. The conceptual model is implemented using simulation strategies and the HUMOSIM Framework. Analyses demonstrate that the HUMOSIM Framework provides improvements on simulation capabilities over the <b>built-in</b> <b>Jack</b> functionality, such as the prediction of force-exertion posture and stepping motions. But knowledge gaps are also identified for part handling simulations, in particular the prediction of grasping and re-grasping. Methods for integrating part assembly paths generated by other simulation software are also needed...|$|R
30|$|Specimen {{is placed}} over roller-hinge supports, and loading points are marked on shear span. Load is applied {{incrementally}} by single hydraulic <b>jack</b> <b>system.</b> Rate of loading is adjusted {{in such a}} way that failure does not occur in less than 1 h. Rate of loading adopted for static test is 0.1 mm/s. Tests are determined as per the maximum design value or discontinued when the deflections reach L/ 50 where L is the effective span.|$|R
