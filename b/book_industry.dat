5|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc. Although Rowling found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics, young readers and the <b>book</b> <b>industry,</b> although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, while others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and on the way in which a person's character {{is the result of the}} person's choices.|$|E

25|$|Although most {{romance novels}} are about {{heterosexual}} pairings {{there is a}} sizable number of romance novels that deal with same-sex relationships. This is often considered a subgenre, and some participants in the <b>book</b> <b>industry</b> characterize books dealing with same-sex relationships as F/F, and M/M.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the comic}} <b>book</b> <b>industry</b> crash of 1996, Norm Breyfogle was {{unemployed}} {{and looking for}} work. As {{a result of a}} request Breyfogle made to DC for employment, Darren Vincenzo, then an editorial assistant at DC Comics, suggested multiple projects which Breyfogle could take part in. Among his suggestions was an Anarky limited series, written by Grant, which was eventually the project decided upon.|$|E

25|$|Near {{the end of}} {{his time}} at Marvel, Byrne was hired by DC Comics to revamp its {{flagship}} character Superman. This was part of a company-wide restructuring {{of the history of the}} DC Universe and all of its characters following the limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths. Byrne's reworking of Superman in particular gained widespread media coverage outside the comic <b>book</b> <b>industry,</b> including articles in Time and The New York Times.|$|E
25|$|Within the <b>book</b> <b>industry,</b> {{printers}} often fly some {{copies of}} the finished book to publishers as sample copies to aid sales or to be sent out for pre-release reviews. The remaining books often travel from the printing facility via sea freight. Accordingly, the delay between {{the approval of the}} pre-press proof and the arrival of books in a warehouse, much less in a retail store, can take some months. For books that tie into movie release-dates (particularly for children's films), publishers will arrange books to arrive in store up to two months prior to the movie release to build interest in the movie.|$|E
25|$|The central {{publishing}} houses {{belonging to}} ministries or (other) government institutions have their main seat at Beijing (40 {{percent of all}} publishers). Most regional publishing houses are situated in the capitals of the provinces. Universities also have associated presses. Private publishing is tolerated. 220,000 books were published in 2005. Among 579 publishers– almost five times {{more than thirty years}} ago– 225 are supervised by ministries, commissions or the army; 348 are controlled by agencies; and six are even more independent. On the other hand, 100,000 private bookstores bring in the half of the income of the <b>book</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E

25|$|This was {{the first}} series to be {{launched}} in 2005 under DC's All Star imprint. These series are helmed by renowned writers and artists in the American comic <b>book</b> <b>industry</b> and attempt to retell some {{of the history of}} prominent DC Universe characters, but outside of DC Universe continuity, and not be restricted by it, in order to appeal to new and returning readers. Each title under the All Star imprint is set in its own continuity and separate universe. According to Miller, the series takes place in the same continuity as Miller's other Batman-related works, such as The Dark Knight Returns.|$|E
25|$|Harris ran the Mary Martin Bookshop in Adelaide {{with his}} {{university}} friend Mary Maydwell Martin. They published a monthly newsletter with literary criticism, comment and book reviews. After Mary Martin moved to India, Harris expanded the book chain across Australia and Hong Kong. The chain pioneered the remaindered <b>book</b> <b>industry</b> in Australia by offering quality titles at reasonable prices. Harris fought the stranglehold which overseas publishers {{had on the}} Australian book market, taking on major publishing houses to ensure accessibly-priced books for Australian readers. The Mary Martin chain was sold to Macmillans in the late 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Seduction of the Innocent {{is a book}} by American {{psychiatrist}} Fredric Wertham, {{published in}} 1954, that warned that comic books were a negative form of popular literature and a serious cause of juvenile delinquency. The book was taken seriously at the time, and was a minor bestseller that created alarm in parents and galvanized them to campaign for censorship. At the same time, a U.S. Congressional inquiry was launched into the comic <b>book</b> <b>industry.</b> Subsequent to the publication of Seduction of the Innocent, the Comics Code Authority was voluntarily established by publishers to self-censor their titles.|$|E

25|$|The American {{comic book}} {{was invented in}} New York City in the early 1930s {{as a way to}} cheaply repackage and resell {{newspaper}} comic strips, which also experienced their major period of creative growth and development in New York papers in {{the first decades of the}} 20th century. Immigrant culture in the city was the central topic and inspiration for comics from the days of Hogan's Alley, the Yellow Kid, The Katzenjammer Kids and beyond. Virtually all creators and workers employed in the early comic <b>book</b> <b>industry</b> were based in New York, from publishers to artists, many of them coming from immigrant Jewish families in the Lower East Side and Brooklyn.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s, Charlton was in decline. The comic <b>book</b> <b>industry</b> {{was in a}} sales slump, {{struggling}} to reinvent a profitable distribution and retail system. Charlton's licensed titles lapsed, its aging presses were deteriorating towards uselessness, and the company {{did not have the}} resources to replace them. In 1981, there was yet another attempt at new material, with a comic book version of Charlton Bullseye serving as a new-talent showcase that actively solicited submissions by comic book fans, and an attempt at new Ditko-produced titles. A number of 1970s-era titles were also reprinted under the Modern Comics imprint and sold in bagged sets in department stores (in much the same way Gold Key Comics were published under the Whitman Comics branding around the same time). None of these measures worked, however, and in 1984 Charlton Comics suspended publication.|$|E
500|$|Comics are an {{established}} art form in Japan, {{which has the}} biggest comic <b>book</b> <b>industry</b> in the world. Comics are respected and aimed at both child and adult audiences.

500|$|When an {{interviewer}} commented that Anarky was popular among fans in 2003, {{in the midst}} of the character's period of obscurity, Norm Breyfogle offered a caveat: [...] "Well, in certain segments of the comic <b>book</b> <b>industry,</b> I suppose." [...] Breyfogle continued, [...] "It has some diehard fans. But, DC doesn't seem to want to do anything with him. Maybe it's because of his anti-authoritarian philosophy, a very touchy subject in today's world." ...|$|E
500|$|The graphic {{novel was}} {{published}} in October 1989 {{in the wake of}} Tim Burton's film Batman. Upon its release, the graphic novel became a commercial success and catapulted Morrison and McKean's name in the comic <b>book</b> <b>industry.</b> Editor Karen Berger revealed that it has sold [...] "close to a half million copies" [...] by 2004, making it the best-selling original graphic novel in American superhero comics. According to the Grant Morrison website, the series has already sold over 600,000 copies worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the comic}} <b>book</b> <b>industry</b> crash of 1996, Norm Breyfogle sought new {{employment}} at DC Comics. Darren Vincenzo, then an editorial {{assistant at the}} company, suggested multiple projects which Breyfogle could take part in. Among his suggestions was an Anarky limited series, to be written by Grant or another specified author. Following encouragement from Breyfogle, Grant {{agreed to participate in}} the project. The four-issue limited series, Anarky, was published in May 1997. Entitled [...] "Metamorphosis", the story maintained the character's anti-authoritarian sentiments, but was instead based on Neo-Tech, a philosophy developed by Frank R. Wallace.|$|E
