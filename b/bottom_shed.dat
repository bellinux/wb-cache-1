5000|$|A serious fire {{occurred}} in October 1918. The fire {{did not affect}} the boilers or the engine, and the mill was fully operational again 10 days after the incident. However, the mill front was damaged, and was subsequently rebuilt, though as a single-storey building. During the rebuilding, the mill looms were relocated to the <b>bottom</b> <b>shed.</b> As forementioned, Prudence the engine, was undamaged in the fire and was renamed [...] Peace, in respect for the fallen soldiers of the First World War.|$|E
50|$|High {{atop the}} lower sheds is {{a figure that}} {{takes the form of}} a tightrope walker; this {{character}} is known at Tommy Milner and legend has it that if the figure were to be removed from its position, disaster would befall the railway. True to form, it was removed for repairs in 1992 and a disastrous fire ripped through the <b>bottom</b> <b>shed,</b> all but destroying winter saloon No. 22 (but this was subsequently rebuilt). The figure was returned and has not been removed since.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the NWGA is to improve both {{the quality and quantity}} of wool produced in the communal wool sheep farming areas of South Africa. Shearing sheds in the communal area were divided into three performance categories namely top, average and <b>bottom</b> <b>sheds.</b> This finding has led to two questions: Why and where do they differ? Can something be done to improve the performance of the sheds? A total of five (5) top, five (5) average and seven (7) <b>bottom</b> <b>sheds</b> were selected to collect data from 179 respondents. The socio-economic data is always important to indicate clearly who the respondents are. The average age of respondents is 59. 46 and 64 % male and 36 % females. There are more members in the top sheds than in the other two categories. Although a large number of respondents can read and write, the majority do have only a qualification at the lower level. A total of 83 % of the respondents do have some years of experience in sheep farming. Respondents in the top shed have significantly more sheep, cattle and goats than respondents in the average and <b>bottom</b> <b>sheds.</b> Significantly more farmers attend the top shed meetings than farmer members in the other two categories. A total of 39 % respondents indicated that good sheep health control will lead to higher wool production and the most common diseases as perceived by respondents are Sheep scab, Blue tongue and internal parasites. Burr/weeds and paints are the two most important objects of wool contamination. Significantly more sheep are sheared in the top sheds, they pack more bales and the weight of the bales is higher than in the average and <b>bottom</b> <b>sheds.</b> Farmer’s most important needs are financial issues, farm infrastructure and they need more land. To improve the profitability and productivity of wool sheep farming at all shearing sheds within the communal farming area. A specific extension program addressing the specific needs will be presented to farmers in each of the three shearing shed groups. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The X(3872) and Y(4260), both {{discovered}} in π^+π^- J/ψ mode, are rather unusual: X_c≡ X(3872) is very narrow, while Y_c ≡ Y(4260) has large Y_c→π^+π^-J/ψ width. Many models for their composition have been suggested, but perhaps discovering their <b>bottom</b> counterparts could <b>shed</b> much {{light on the}} issue. The narrow state, X_b may be searched for at the Tevatron via pp̅→π^+π^-Υ + X, with the LHC much more promising. The state Y_b can be searched for at B factories via radiative return e^+e^- →γ_ ISR + π^+π^-Υ on Υ(5 S), or by e^+e^- →π^+π^-Υ direct scan.

50|$|The Queen Street Mill Manufacturing Company was {{established}} in 1894, capitalised with ₤20,000 in £5 shares. The first board of directors was listed as Brierley Edmondson (weaver), William Kippax (weaver), George Lane (builder), John Nuttall (glazer), Thomas Pickles (foreman), John Taylor (weaver), Whitaker Whitaker (weaver), and James Corrin (Headteacher, Haggate School) who became the first company secretary. The company built the Queen Street Mill between 1894 and 1895. As money was scarce only one Lancashire boiler was installed, and it was six years before the second was bought. The weaving shed was single storey, and the mill frontage was three storey. All the looms were bought from Burnley companies, Pemberton & Co. and Harling & Todd Ltd., and have not been replaced. The mill was originally equipped with 900 single shuttle Lancashire looms capable of producing grey cloth. When this was not enough, the company installed a further 366 looms at Primrose Mill, Harle Syke which was the room and power mill immediately adjacent but slightly downhill. To the workers it {{was known as the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>shed.</b>|$|E
40|$|The X(3872) and Y(4260), among {{a host of}} charmonium-like mesons, have rather unusual properties: {{the former}} has very small total width, the latter has large rate into π^+π^-J/ψ channel.

We point out that discovering the <b>bottom</b> counterparts should <b>shed</b> much light on the issue. The narrow state can be searched for at the Tevatron via pp̅→π^+π^-Υ + X, but the LHC should be much more promising.

40|$|Awarded Best Paper (Student) - Joint Winner - EEA Conference 2011 Recent {{work in the}} University of Canterbury {{high voltage}} {{laboratory}} uncovered an interesting phenomenon. While studying the effect of volcanic ash contamination on high voltage insulator flashover levels, ash was seen ‘blowing’ off the insulator surface before flashover occurred. The goal of this project was to investigate and explain the observed phenomenon to {{provide a basis for}} potential development of self-cleaning insulators. Four different types of insulator and three different ash grain sizes were tested. The insulator electric fields were modelled; corona discharge waveforms and visual observations were obtained. Areas of ash removal coincided with areas of corona discharge. It was initially proposed that the ash was removed by an alternating current corona wind however the results do not support this theory. Instead, the observed results suggest that the ash acquires a negative charge and is removed by an electrostatic force. The electrostatic force is strongest during the negative half cycle of the applied voltage due to space charge and hence the ash pulses off the insulator at 50 Hz. The amount of ash removed increased with the applied voltage however this led to a trade off between ash removal and flashover. The maximum amount of ash removed during this project was approximately 90 % from the top weather shed and 30 % from the middle and <b>bottom</b> weather <b>sheds.</b> This study focused on the removal of dry ash. It is unlikely that wet ash can be removed in this fashion, without flashover, due to the conductive and adhesive nature of wet ash...|$|R
