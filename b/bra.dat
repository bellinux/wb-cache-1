5|$|The $15 million {{price tag}} for the 2000 <b>bra</b> worn by Gisele Bündchen earned {{a place in the}} Guinness World Records as the most {{expensive}} item of lingerie ever created. The $3 million 2009 Harlequin Fantasy <b>Bra</b> and the $2 million 2010 Bombshell Fantasy <b>Bra</b> were designed by Damiani. Listed below are the prices per set (including accessories for the 2007 and 2013 editions, the 2013 <b>bra</b> alone is worth $8,000,000). The 2012 Floral Fantasy <b>Bra</b> was accompanied by a $500,000 perfume bottle.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} an underwire {{can be traced to}} an 1893 patent that {{describes}} a breast supporting device using a rigid plate under the breasts for stability. The modern underwire <b>bra</b> was designed in the 1930s, and gained widespread popularity by the 1950s. As of 2005, underwire bras were the largest and fastest growing segment of the <b>bra</b> market. A <b>bra</b> without an underwire is a softcup <b>bra.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{medical report}} {{documented}} that wearing an underwire <b>bra</b> in the Tropics, specifically East Africa, {{can lead to}} severe furuncular myiasis of the breast caused by the Tumbu fly. The eggs and larvae from this fly are deposited in clothing, especially {{along the length of}} the metal wires of an underwire <b>bra,</b> and can only be killed by applying heat through ironing. It is almost impossible when ironing a traditional underwire <b>bra</b> to achieve the required heat to kill the larvae deposited along the underwire.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bras</b> {{can enhance}} or {{minimize}} {{the size of}} breasts, create cleavage, {{and in the case}} of nursing <b>bras,</b> aid breast-feeding. <b>Bras</b> are built into some swimsuits, camisoles and dresses. Compression sports <b>bras</b> push against and minimize the breasts, whereas encapsulation <b>bras</b> have cups for support.|$|R

50|$|Sports <b>bras</b> {{can either}} {{encapsulate}} or compress breasts. <b>Bras</b> that encapsulate breasts have molded cups, while compression-type <b>bras</b> restrict movement by flattening the breasts. Encapsulation-type <b>bras</b> generally {{are more effective}} at reducing discomfort, but some women prefer compression designs.|$|R
5|$|Because underwire can tear through cloth, {{most women}} hand-wash underwire bras or machine-wash {{them on a}} {{delicate}} cycle. <b>Bra</b> wash bags, usually zippered mesh pouches, {{can also be used}} to protect bras and prevent the underwire from separating from the <b>bra</b> during machine washing.|$|E
5|$|Heidi Klum and Adriana Lima {{have worn}} the Fantasy <b>Bra</b> in three {{different}} years. Gisele Bündchen, Tyra Banks, Karolina Kurkova, and Alessandra Ambrosio have each worn two Fantasy Bras. Tyra Banks also wore the 1995 Million Dollar Miracle <b>Bra</b> during the 1999 fashion show.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the underwire of a girl's <b>bra</b> {{helped save}} her life when she was impaled on a railing and, {{according}} to hospital personnel, the underwire from her <b>bra</b> probably helped deflect the spike from her heart. There have been multiple incidents where bullets were deflected by the underwire of a woman's <b>bra,</b> either keeping her entirely from harm, or directing the bullet away from the heart {{to another part of}} the body.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>bras</b> {{close in}} the back with a series of hooks and eyes. Since <b>bras</b> are elastic, they can still be donned with the closure in front and reversed. Some <b>bras</b> have front hooks, and others, {{particularly}} sports <b>bras,</b> have no closure at all.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bras</b> d'Or Lake [...] is an inland sea, {{or large}} body of {{partially}} fresh/salt water in the centre of Cape Breton Island {{in the province of}} Nova Scotia, Canada. <b>Bras</b> d'Or Lake is sometimes referred to as the <b>Bras</b> d'Or Lakes or the <b>Bras</b> d'Or Lakes system; however, its official geographic name is <b>Bras</b> d'Or Lake as it is a singular entity. Canadian author and yachtsman Silver Donald Cameron describes <b>Bras</b> d'Or Lake as [...] "A basin ringed by indigo hills laced with marble. Islands within a sea inside an island." [...] The lake is connected to the North Atlantic by natural channels, the Great <b>Bras</b> d'Or Channel north of Boularderie Island and the Little <b>Bras</b> d'Or Channel to south of Boularderie Island, connect the northeastern arm of the lake to the Cabot Strait. The <b>Bras</b> d'Or is also connected to Atlantic Ocean via the Strait of Canso by means of a lock canal completed in 1869—the St. Peters Canal, at the southern tip of the lake.|$|R

5|$|Underwire bras can rub and pinch the breast, causing skin {{irritation}} and breast pain, and the wire of a worn <b>bra</b> can protrude from the fabric and scrape or cut the skin. When {{the fabric of}} worn <b>bra</b> exposes an underwire, skin contact with nickel and other metals may cause contact dermatitis in a few women.|$|E
5|$|Use of an {{automated}} external defibrillator on a patient in a metal underwire <b>bra</b> can cause burns, and the <b>bra</b> should be removed by the first responder before the AED is applied. In their 2007 season, the television program MythBusters tested the possibility of burns resulting from using a defibrillator on a patient who is using an underwire <b>bra,</b> and concluded that while it is possible, {{it is not likely}} unless the metal underwire is exposed and paddles of the defibrillator are very close to it.|$|E
5|$|With the {{popularity}} and {{widespread use of}} the underwire <b>bra</b> that started during the 1950s, the underwire was incorporated into many <b>bra</b> designs, and underwire bras were built into other articles of clothing. By 1990, Norma Kamali had incorporated underwire bras into both one- and two-piece (bikini) swimsuits. Scott Lucretia was granted a patent for a camisole with an integrated underwire <b>bra</b> in 1989.|$|E

5|$|The city {{went into}} decline {{by the early}} to mid-20th century, as {{factories}} became old and obsolete and businesses {{moved out of the}} region for cheaper labor elsewhere.

In 1958, <b>BRA</b> initiated a project to improve the historic West End neighborhood. Extensive demolition was met with strong public opposition.|$|E

5000|$|East Bay is one {{of three}} long narrow arms that extend to the east of {{the main body of the}} <b>Bras</b> d'Or Lake, the others being St. Andrews Channel and Great <b>Bras</b> d'Or Channel.

5|$|Underwire bras are {{occasionally}} {{linked to}} health conditions including breast pain, mastitis, and metal allergies. Women wearing an underwire <b>bra</b> {{have in a}} few rare instances been subjected to extra scrutiny when their <b>bra</b> set off metal detectors at security checkpoints in airports or prisons. There {{have been a few}} recorded incidents where the underwire deflected a bullet or other weapon that struck the woman's chest.|$|E
5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, may {{contribute}} to clogged milk ducts in lactating women. Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, they do not easily accommodate changes in breast size, and an ill-fitting <b>bra</b> that {{does not support the}} breasts correctly can cause discomfort and pain. For several days after a mastectomy, or as long as the breast is tender, a woman is advised not to use an underwire <b>bra.</b>|$|E

She made her WWF television debut on the June 14, 2001 episode of SmackDown! when then-face, Shane McMahon {{brought her to the}} ring to distract then-heel, Rhyno, causing him to lose a match. Keibler originally teamed up with real-life friend, then-heel, Torrie Wilson, and the pair feuded with Trish Stratus and Lita. During this feud the four wrestlers competed in the first-ever tag team <b>Bra</b> and Panties Match at the Invasion pay-per-view, which Trish and Lita won by stripping Stacy down to her yellow <b>bra</b> & panties and Torrie Wilson to her white <b>bra</b> & panties.|$|E
