25|$|In 2005, the CCHS {{accountant}} {{was charged}} with embezzling money from the school. CCHS enrollment peaked in 2009 with 423 students. As $2,000,000 in financial pledges for construction of the new school building were left unfulfilled, capital campaigns at the four regional Catholic parishes were started in 2011 {{to pay off the}} remaining debt. A 2013 upgrade installed school-wide wireless internet access in conjunction with a new <b>bring</b> <b>your</b> own device program. A student center and welcome center were added in summer 2015 renovations. In recent years, enrollment at the school has dropped, attributed in part to the diminished presence of State Farm Insurance in the area.|$|E

500|$|Black {{players were}} a novelty in pro {{football}} when Perry entered the league, {{and he was}} faced with racial abuse and discrimination {{on and off the}} field. [...] "I can't remember a season when I didn't hear a racial slur," [...] he said. [...] "Someone would say, 'Nigger, don't come through here again', and I'd say, 'I'm coming through again, and you better <b>bring</b> <b>your</b> family.'" [...] When he was invited to play in the 1949 AAFC All-Star game in Houston, he and other black players on the all-star team were not allowed to stay in the same hotel as white players. There was initial uncertainty over whether or not black players would be allowed to participate in the game at all. Perry's 49ers teammates, however, were more accepting of him, and provided him strong support from the outset.|$|E

As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with [...] "Come out and play, make up the rules" [...] instead of the eventual opening of [...] "Load up on guns, <b>bring</b> <b>your</b> friends." [...] A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on [...] A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary , filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth.|$|E

500|$|New Jersey law prohibits strip {{clubs and}} [...] "sexually {{oriented}} business", where stripteases and erotic dances are regularly performed, from offering both full nudity and alcohol sales. Establishments that possess a retail license and serve alcohol can only offer partially clothed {{services such as}} go-go dancing (typically in bikinis or lingerie). Clubs that are not licensed to serve alcohol will work around the restriction by implementing a <b>bring</b> <b>your</b> own bottle (BYOB) policy and operating as a [...] "juice bar". Juice bars have the appointments of full bars but only serve non-alcoholic beverages such as water, fruit juice, and flavored carbonated beverages. Such a bar could double as a service counter for the storage of BYOB material and offer ice and mixing services to create mixed drinks using the customer-purchased ingredients. Recent court decisions have held that municipalities that allow BYOB policies for restaurants must allow the same practices for strip clubs.|$|E
500|$|As a young man, {{despite his}} dance talent, Sims {{aspired to be}} not a {{professional}} dancer, but a professional boxer. After twice breaking his hand, he decided he needed a different means of making a living. Sims had noticed that boxing audiences reacted positively {{to the way he}} would dance in the rosin box before getting into the ring, and especially to the distinctive sound his dancing made moving the rosin granules around the wooden box. He began to consider dancing as a career alternative. Sims experimented with several different methods of reproducing the rosin box effect, gluing sandpaper to either his shoes or his dancing mat, but the sandpaper created too much wear on the other surface. Finally he found the solution: loose sand in a low-lipped box. [...] "People went for the scraping sound... So I made a sound board by sprinkling sand on a flat platform. That was in 1935." [...] His sandbox remained his trademark throughout his career, with some venues even telling Sims, [...] "If you don't <b>bring</b> <b>your</b> sandbox, don't come at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Gregg Shapiro of the Bay Area Reporter {{gave the}} album a mostly {{negative}} review, calling it [...] "hazardous waste". He {{also noted that}} Spears's voice was [...] "reedy, cold and mechanical" [...] when stripped from the original mixes. However, he highlighted two tracks, saying: [...] "Spears comes closest to achieving dance-diva status on the Valentin remix of [...] "Everytime", while the Davidson Ospina 2005 remix of [...] "Baby One More Time" [...] elevates the original bubblegum track to club classic." [...] Mike Daniel of The Dallas Morning News called the Justice remix of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] the best track of the album, but said it [...] "has {{the feel of a}} hastily executed stopgap measure with almost no marketing-related thought behind it except to fulfill the once-every-two-years release cycle that's been established for Britney material." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Leah Greenblatt noted the remixes [...] "amps already-aggressive singles like [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] to brain-popping levels of synth spiraling", and transforms [...] "sad-eyed slow jams like [...] "Everytime" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] into Hi-NRG bursts.

500|$|Nirvana often {{altered the}} song's lyrics and tempo for live {{performances}}. Some live {{performances of the}} song had the line [...] "our little group has always been" [...] changed to [...] "our little tribe has always been," [...] which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of [...] "Teen Spirit" [...] " [...] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit." [...] A notable alternate performance of [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, [...] "Load up on guns, <b>bring</b> <b>your</b> friends" [...] became [...] "Load up on drugs, kill your friends"). [...] Cobain later said {{he was trying to}} sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] as the third greatest in the show's history.
