5000|$|C-130E, AF Ser. No. 62-1787, {{on display}} at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, was flown to the museum on 18 August 2011. One of the {{greatest}} feats of heroism during the Vietnam War involved the C-130E, call sign [...] "Spare 617". The C-130E attempted to airdrop ammunition to surrounded South Vietnamese forces at An Loc, Vietnam. Approaching the drop zone, Spare 617 received heavy enemy ground fire that damaged two engines, ruptured a bleed air duct in the cargo compartment, and set the ammunition on fire. Flight engineer TSgt Sanders was killed, and navigator 1st Lt Lenz and co-pilot 1st Lt Hering were both wounded. Despite receiving severe burns from hot air escaping from the damaged air <b>bleed</b> <b>duct,</b> loadmaster TSgt Shaub extinguished a fire in the cargo compartment, and successfully jettisoned the cargo pallets, which exploded in mid-air. Despite losing a third engine on final approach, pilot Capt Caldwell landed Spare 617 safely. For their actions, Caldwell and Shaub received the Air Force Cross, the U.S. Air Force's second highest award for valor. TSgt Shaub also received the William H. Pitsenbarger Award for Heroism from the Air Force Sergeants Association.|$|E

In order to ensure reliable aircraft performance and avoid thermal failure of heat sensitive components, consideration must be given to the wide range of temperatures that the aircraft will encounter when designing aircraft internal enclosures. This thesis presents an investigation into the fluid flow and heat transfer within an aircraft wing leading edge compartment due to solar loading and the presence of an internal <b>bleed</b> <b>duct.</b> A detailed experimental investigation into the thermal distribution, <b>bleed</b> <b>duct</b> heat transfer and flow structure was performed for 1 105 < Grasho f No: < 4 105 in a representative wing leading edge enclosure constructed for this purpose. Temperature measurements were recorded along the interior surfaces along with the internal air temperature in the cavity. Particle Image Velocimetery (PIV) was used to quantify the flowfield present in the leading edge. There were three main aspects to this thesis: The first was to characterise the enclosure conditions and <b>bleed</b> <b>duct</b> heat transfer within the sealed leading edge. This was performed firstly to gain an understanding of the heat transfer characteristics within the leading edge and secondly to use as a comparison for when ventilation was introduced. It was observed that the confining effect of the enclosure was only evident at the higher Gr range investigated, with the initial heat transfer similar to that of an unconfined cylinder. The interior temperature distribution was also dependent upon Gr, with the plume mixing effect creating a more homogeneous air temperature as Gr increased. The effect of enclosure ventilation was also considered with a view to helping reduce a thermally aggressive environment which can be present in a hot ambient environment. The placement of the ventilation openings was limited due to the geometric constraints of the leading edge, yet a 77 % increase in the <b>bleed</b> <b>duct</b> heat transfer was observed for a dual vent opening configuration. Geometrical effects within the leading edge were investigated in order to appreciate their influence on heat transfer and ventilation. Partitioning of the leading edge (due to a front sub-spar) produced a blockage between the inlet and outlet vent which reduced the <b>bleed</b> <b>duct</b> heat transfer. Interior temperature and flowfield were also observed to be dependent upon the <b>bleed</b> <b>duct</b> position, as its buoyant plume was the main driver of the flow structure within. The effect of a larger, constant temperature cylinder was also considered with its position relative to the <b>bleed</b> <b>duct</b> important for heat transfer as it was effectively eliminated when located below the <b>bleed</b> <b>duct</b> with a higher surface temperature. The findings of this thesis allow for a detailed understanding of the thermal environment and flow structure in a non-standard enclosure shape subjected to exterior heating and internal heat source. This is of practical relevance for the design of aircraft enclosures to help eliminate the possibility of thermal failure of components and affect aircraft operations...|$|E
40|$|A mission {{analysis}} {{code was}} developed to perform a trade study {{on the effectiveness of}} liquefying bleed for the inlet of the first stage of a TSTO vehicle. By liquefying bleed, the vehicle weight (TOGW) could be reduced by 7 to 23 %. Numerous simplifying assumptions were made and lessons were learned. Increased accuracy in future analyses can be achieved by: Including a higher fidelity model to capture the effect of rescaling (variable vehicle TOGW). Refining specific thrust and impulse models (T m a and Isp) to preserve fuel-to-air ratio. Implementing LH 2 for T m a and Isp. Correlating baseline design to other mission analyses and correcting vehicle design elements. Implementing angle-of-attack effects on inlet characteristics. Refining aerodynamic performance (to improve L/D ratio at higher Mach numbers). Examining the benefit with partial cooling or densification of the bleed air stream. Incorporating higher fidelity weight estimates for the liquefied bleed system (heat exchange and liquid storage versus <b>bleed</b> <b>duct</b> weights) could be added when more fully developed.

Results were interpreted from schlieren visualizations, IR thermography, static and Pitot pressure readings and mass flow measurements. The off-design investigation of both inlet configurations revealed the sensitivity of the inlet towards a cowl shock induced separation on the second compression ramp. If the cowl shock was not ensured to fall into the <b>bleed</b> <b>duct</b> behind the second ramp, no inlet flow could be established.

The flight vehicle will spin on its axis at 4 to 6 Hz, and precess at 0. 1 Hz at an angle that may (worst case) be as high as ± 4 °. The CFD studies indicate that the intake/bleed duct configuration will perform well at 0 ° angle of attack, with successful capture of the unwanted flow features. Minor influences on the combustor entrance conditions from the effects of freestream Mach number variation and from the state of the boundary layer will be experienced. On the other hand, at the extreme values of angle of attack considered, there is a very strong effect on the combustor entrance conditions, with possible separation of the main intake wall boundary layer on the windward side. CFD studies of the exhaust nozzle flowfields indicate that the lift force generated by the flight experiment will always be directed from the fuel-on side towards the scramjet centreline, and will be greatest when the fuel-on side is the leeward side of the vehicle. Integration of this force over the vehicle spin period shows that the effective force experienced by the vehicle will always be directed towards the precession axis, thus damping the precession and assisting flight stability...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 71 - 75) "May 2006. "The {{bleed air}} system in an aircraft engine {{is one of}} the most important systems for flight operation and is the heart of the aircraft engine pneumatic system. It consists of ducts and components that supply high pressure bleed air from the engine compressor to the other systems. The functioning of bleed air system plays a vital role in flight safety, ground operations, and coordination with other existing systems [1] including fuel system, lubrication system, ignition system, and anti-ice system. A prior Wichita State University Research and Creative Award (URCA) research project entitled "Aircraft Pneumatic Leak Detection Methods" was the motivation for this thesis work. In this research, different inspection techniques were studied to detect leaks in <b>bleed</b> air <b>ducts.</b> Existing conditions such as continuous high pressure and temperature loading within a duct can make it prone to leak because of high stress concentration areas, pre-existing flaws, or manufacturing defects. A general-purpose finite element package, ABAQUS was used for stress analysis of cracked structures such as tubular T-joints. The high stress concentration region at the intersection of the duct joints was assumed to have certain initial flaws. This initial crack flaw was analyzed using line-spring elements to compute the stress intensity factor (SIF). The values of SIF obtained from the present analysis were compared with appropriate results in the literature. Stresses from the finite element analysis were used as input in AFGROW, a crack growth software package consisting of extensive material properties and all necessary fracture mechanics parameters required for crack-growth analysis. Damage tolerance was applied to estimate the life of the duct. The leak-before-break concept was used to determine whether crack growth in the duct would lead to any kind of leak or catastrophic failure. Crack and leak detection techniques to evaluate the crack size are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundControl of hepatic inflow {{is a key}} {{manoeuvre}} during right hepatectomy and {{has traditionally}} been achieved by extrahepatic dissection of the component right portal inflow structures at the hepatic hilum. An alternative technique is the anterior intrahepatic approach (AIA), in which the Glissonian sheath is isolated within {{the substance of the}} liver during parenchymal transection and secured using an endovascular stapling device. This study evaluates the intrahepatic, extra-Glissonian technique in comparison with classical extrahepatic dissection (EHD) in right hepatectomy. MethodsA retrospective case-controlled study referring to a 20 -year period identified 342 consecutive patients who underwent right hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases from a prospectively compiled database. The AIA to right hepatectomy was used in 182 of these patients and the extrahepatic approach in 160. The two groups were matched for age, gender, stage of primary tumour and number and size of metastases. Outcome measures included safety factors (<b>bleeding,</b> bile <b>duct</b> injury and gun failure), operative duration, oncological margin, morbidity and mortality. ResultsThere {{were no significant differences between}} the two groups in terms of operative duration (240 min vs. 260 min) or postoperative change in haemoglobin (1. 3 g/dl vs. 1. 4 g/dl). The AIA was associated with lower operative blood loss (355 ml vs. 425 ml; P≤ 0. 001), a reduced rate of significant morbidity (14. 6 % vs. 23. 1 %; P= 0. 005), better R 0 resection rates (93 % vs. 89 %; P= 0. 014) and a lower 90 -day mortality rate (3 % vs. 7 %; P= 0. 046). There was one minor bile leak in each group, two clinically significant bile leaks requiring endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and stenting in the extrahepatic group, and a further persistent bile leak requiring biliary reconstruction in each group. In two instances the endovascular stapler misfired. Both cases were dealt with at the time of surgery with no further sequelae. The length of hospital stay was equivalent in the two groups (8 days vs. 9 days). ConclusionsIn selected patients, intrahepatic, extra-Glissonian stapled right hepatectomy is feasible, safe and avoids the need for EHD. The anterior approach to right hepatectomy may achieve outcomes at least as good as those associated with the classical extrahepatic approach...|$|R
30|$|In {{previous}} reports, clinical symptoms included {{gastrointestinal bleeding}} (49.3 %) and abdominal pain and/or back pain (40.6 %), while patients (18.8 %) were asymptomatic [22]. The causes of gastrointestinal bleeding from pancreatic AVM in 26 patients were reported. Esophageal or gastric varices from portal hypertension {{were observed in}} 11 patients (42 %). Duodenal ulcer or duodenal bleeding was observed in 13 patients (50 %). Hemobilia was observed in three patients (12 %), and pancreatic <b>duct</b> <b>bleeding</b> was observed in two patients (8 %) [13]. The treatment of pancreatic AVM is controversial. In pancreatic AVM case series reported by Chou et al., surgical resection has been considered the first choice (43.8 %), {{but it is not}} always feasible given its invasiveness. Transarterial embolization (TAE) alone (11.2 %), TAE + surgery (10.1 %), and radiotherapy (2.2 %) have been attempted as alternative or adjunct treatments [12]. Some reports recommend surgical resection or TAE for not only symptomatic pancreatic AVM but also asymptomatic cases due to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or rupture of the esophageal varices in response to the portal hypertension induced by pancreatic AVM [12, 22]. We decided to perform pancreatoduodenectomy in the present case to control repeated duodenal bleeding caused by the AVM that had developed around the SCN. Pancreatectomy should be considered in patients who develop gastrointestinal bleeding from pancreatic AVM around a pancreatic tumor, as {{it can be difficult to}} control the duodenal bleeding by other treatments.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the clinical feasibility {{and value of}} transumbilical single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative ultrasonic knife for directly handling the cystic artery. MethodsA retrospective analysis {{was performed on the}} clinical data of 231 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative ultrasonic knife for directly handling the cystic artery in our department from March 2011 to December 2012. According to the required surgical approaches, the patients were divided into transumbilical single-port laparoscopic group (n= 125, group A) and three-port laparoscopic group (n= 106, group B). The two groups were compared in terms of operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative analgesia, postoperative food intake, length of postoperative hospital stay, and postoperative complications, as well as the performance of the ultrasonic knife in directly handling the cystic artery. Comparison of continuous data between groups was made by t test, while comparison of categorical data was made by chi-square test. ResultsGroup A had a significantly longer mean operative time than group B (20. 21 ± 1. 86 min vs 18. 43 ± 1. 37 min, P＜ 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference in}} mean intraoperative blood loss between groups A and B (23. 23 ± 6. 25 ml vs 22. 34 ± 5. 49 ml, P＞ 0. 05). Group A had significantly fewer patients who needed postoperative analgesia than group B (5 vs 21, P＜ 0. 05). The time to postoperative food intake showed no significant difference between groups A and B (6. 56 ± 1. 23 h vs 6. 67 ± 1. 45 h, P＞ 0. 05). The mean length of postoperative hospital stay was (2. 98 ± 0. 23) d in group A, versus (3. 02 ± 0. 18) d in group B (P＞ 0. 05). No indwelling drainage tube was used after operation in either group. There were no postoperative <b>bleeding,</b> bile <b>duct</b> injury, bile leakage, incisional wound infection, and other complications in the two groups. The ultrasonic knife had reliable hemostatic effect when directly sealing the cystic artery, without causing postoperative secondary bleeding. All patients were followed up for 2 - 12 months (mean, 6. 5 months); they recovered well without incisional hernia, and the umbilical scar was not obvious, with relatively good cosmetic results. ConclusionTransumbilical single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy has a comparable clinical effect to three-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy, causing little trauma, postoperative pain, and scar, and it is suitable for patients with a high demand for incision appearance. Directly sealing the cystic artery with the ultrasonic knife can reduce bleeding due to careful separation of the cystic artery and shorten the operative time. Therefore, it is a safe, feasible surgical approach and worthy of clinical application...|$|R
40|$|Although laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} has rapidly {{developed in}} the treatment of gall bladder disease in the absence of controlled clinical trial data its outcome parameters compared with open cholecystectomy remain unclear. A prospective audit of the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the west of Scotland over a two year period was carried out to attempt to assess this new procedure. A total of 45 surgeons in 19 hospitals performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy submitted prospective data from September 1990 - 1992. A total of 2285 cholecystectomies were audited (a completed data collection rate of 99 %). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted in 1683 (74 %) patients and completed in 1448 patients (median conversion rate to the open procedure 17 %). The median operation time in the completed laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients was 100 minutes (range 30 - 330) and overall hospital stay three days (1 - 33). There were nine deaths (0. 5 %) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy although only two were directly attributable to the laparoscopic procedure. In the laparoscopic cholecystectomy group there were 99 complications (5. 9 %), 53 (3 %) of these were major requiring further invasive intervention. Forty patients (2. 4 %) required early or delayed laparotomy for major complications such as <b>bleeding</b> or bile <b>duct</b> injuries. There were 11 (0. 7 %) bile duct injuries in the laparoscopic cholecystectomy series, five were noted during the initial procedure and six were recognised later resulting from jaundice or bile leaks.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} ongoing research {{intended to}} simulate ice accretion in an inter-compressor <b>duct</b> <b>bleed</b> slot {{resulting from the}} ingestion of altitude ice crystals. The authors have previously shown that ice crystal particle size {{plays an important role}} in the ice crystal accretion phenomenon. It was also shown that ice crystal particle size affects the degree of natural melt that occurs for a given aerodynamic condition. The data presented herein decouples the effects of ice particle melt and particle size distribution to generate accretions with the same ratio of freestream liquid-to-total water fraction. The effects of wet bulb temperature and ice particle size on the natural melting of ice crystals are discussed. An ice preservation procedure is followed to allow tracings of the accretion to be taken along the test article. Ice crystal particle size distribution is characterized using a shadowgraphy imaging technique. Finally, the reduction in accretion rate relative to the theoretical maximum rate of surface accretion by ice crystal particles is discussed. The test article simulates a forward facing, inclined endwall bleed slot in a gas turbine compressor as a simplified two-dimensional representation. The geometry, having a surface inclined 200 to the incoming flow, proved to be susceptible to mixed phase ice crystal accretion. Particle size and particularly the large particle tail of the distribution had a significant impact on the magnitude of accretion under mixed phase test conditions for wet bulb temperatures above and below 00 C. The leading edge growth rates were found to be 1 / 4 to 1 / 9 of the theoretical growth rate suggesting that erosion, splashing, particle bounce and other loss mechanism rates are significant. The ice tracings were used to estimate an accretion mass for a hypothetical large bypass ratio gas turbine. It was found that approximately 4 kg of ice could be generated should the inter-compressor duct be exposed to the conditions tested for 5 minutes. 9 2013 by Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.
