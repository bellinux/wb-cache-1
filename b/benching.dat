5|$|According to The Pride of the Yankees, the 1942 {{film about}} Gehrig's life, Pipp asked {{out of the}} game because he was {{experiencing}} double vision from being hit in the head two days prior. By 1953, Pipp reported to The New York Times that he was taken out of the lineup due to being hit in the head by a pitch thrown by Charlie Caldwell during batting practice. However, while Pipp was hit in the head by a pitch from Caldwell and was hospitalized, this event occurred on July 2, a month after Pipp's <b>benching.</b>|$|E

He played the entire {{second half of the}} Eagles game against the Baltimore Ravens on November 23 after an infamous <b>benching</b> of McNabb. Kolb threw an interception in the endzone to Ed Reed, who took it back 108yards for a touchdown, an NFL record. Kolb completed only 17 passes on 34 attempts for 144yards, throwing no touchdowns and four interceptions during the season.|$|E

On May 28, 2014, Brown was once again assigned to the Shock. He was placed on recallable reassignment on March 14, 2015. Brown was once again assigned to the Shock on March 26, 2015. Brown made his first career start for the Shock during their Week 2 game against the Philadelphia Soul. Brown was able to lead the Shock to a few scoring plays, but his ineffective play ultimately led to his <b>benching</b> in favor of Matt Bassuener. On April 14, 2015, he was placed on reassignment by the Shock.|$|E

5|$|One of Parcells first {{decisions}} as coach was to replace Simms {{as the starting}} quarterback with Brunner. Simms asked to be traded after the <b>benching,</b> but his request was ignored. During the sixth game of the Giants' 1983 Season, Simms came in to replace the struggling Brunner against the Philadelphia Eagles. On his second drive, Simms suffered a season-ending injury when the thumb on his throwing hand hit a player's helmet on his follow-through. The injury was reported as a dislocation, {{but according to the}} book, Simms to McConkey, written by Phil McConkey, Simms, and Dick Schaap, the injury was much more severe, with the thumb literally hanging off after impact, and the bone sticking out through the skin.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his <b>benching,</b> O'Sullivan and Brett Favre were tied for the league lead in interceptions with 11 and O'Sullivan led the league in fumbles with 11. He also led the league in total {{turnovers}} with 11 interceptions and six fumbles lost. O'Sullivan, by himself, had committed more turnovers than any other NFL team at {{the time of}} his demotion. The Denver Broncos, New York Jets and Cincinnati Bengals were tied for the second most turnovers with 16. On October 27, Singletary named Hill the starting quarterback. Hill then started the final eight games of the season. O'Sullivan completed 128 of 220 passes for 1,678 yards and eight touchdowns with 11 interceptions during the 2008 season. The 49ers won two out of the eight games that he started. O'Sullivan, despite only starting eight games, was sacked 32 times, which made him tied for eighth in the NFL with Joe Flacco in number of times sacked.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days after}} his release from the Rams, he signed a one-year, $3 million deal with the New York Giants, with a second year player option. Warner started the 2004 season as the Giants' {{starting}} quarterback, winning five of his first seven games, but following a two-game losing streak, highly touted rookie quarterback Eli Manning was given the starting job. The Giants had a 5–4 win-loss record {{at the time of}} Warner's <b>benching,</b> finishing at 6–10 overall (going only 1–6 under Manning). Following the season, Warner chose to void the second year of his contract, and thus became a free agent.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2012, NBC greatly {{expanded}} its sitcom roster, with eight comedy series airing on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights. NBC bounced back to first place network in adults 18-49 that fall, boosted by the new season of The Voice, the initial success of freshman drama Revolution and sitcom Go On, and the continued strength of Sunday Night Football. However, withholding the new season of The Voice and <b>benching</b> Revolution until late March, the network's midseason ratings suffered, falling to fifth place behind Spanish-language network Univision during the February sweeps period. The 2012–13 season ended with NBC finishing in third place overall, albeit by a narrow margin, with only three new shows, all dramas, surviving for a second season (Revolution, Chicago Fire and Hannibal).|$|E
25|$|After the season, {{majority}} owner Pollin fired Jordan as team president, much to {{the shock}} of players, associates, and the public. Jordan felt betrayed, thinking {{that he would get}} his ownership back after his playing days ended, but Pollin justified Jordan's dismissal by noting that Jordan had detrimental effects on the team, such as <b>benching</b> Hughes for Tyronn Lue, making poor trades, and using the team's 2001 1st round draft pick on high schooler Kwame Brown. Without Jordan in the fold the following year, the Washington Wizards were not expected to win, and they did not. Despite the signing of future All-Star point guard Gilbert Arenas, in a move that was ironically made possible by Jordan's prior cap-clearing maneuvers as a team executive, the team stumbled to a 25–57 record in the 2003–04 season.|$|E
25|$|In {{his second}} spell with Real Madrid, Capello {{implemented}} a 4–2–3–1 formation, which {{made use of}} two defensive-minded full-backs, two defensive midfielders, and two wingers who also often tracked back; however, as a result, the club's main striker, Ruud van Nistelrooy, was often isolated, while the team's efficient playing style was described as being boring in the media, and Capello was frequently derided for his overly defensive tactics. Despite the criticism he endured, Capello made several bold decisions which allowed several talented players to co-exist, <b>benching</b> Ronaldo, and reinstating David Beckham into the starting line-up, {{and was able to}} create an organised and unified team environment through his disciplined approach; he ultimately led the club to an eight match unbeaten streak to come back from behind and claim the Liga title, although he was sacked {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
40|$|Training the <b>bench</b> press {{exercise}} on a traditional flat <b>bench</b> does not induce {{a level of}} instability as seen in sport movements and activities of daily living. Twenty participants were recruited to test two forms of instability: using one dumbbell rather than two and lifting on the COR <b>bench</b> compared to a flat <b>bench.</b> Electromyography (EMG) amplitudes of the pectoralis major, middle trapezius, external oblique, and internal oblique were recorded and compared. Differences in range of motion (ROM) were evaluated by measuring an angular representation of the shoulder complex. Four separate conditions of unilateral <b>bench</b> press were tested while lifting on a: flat <b>bench</b> with one dumbbell, flat <b>bench</b> with two dumbbells, COR <b>Bench</b> with one dumbbell, and COR <b>Bench</b> with two dumbbells.

On August 27, 2013, the 49ers placed Crabtree on the reserve/physically unable to perform list. He was most likely {{to return to the}} field in mid-November 2013. On November 25, 2013, rumors circulated online that he would be activated since November 26 would be the deadline for the team to activate him or face <b>benching</b> him {{for the rest of the}} season. On November 26, 2013, the 49ers activated him and waived a backup quarterback to make room for him on the 53-man roster. Crabtree played his first game of the 2013 season on December 1, 2013, in Week 13 against the St. Louis Rams making 2 receptions for 68 yards and the 49ers won the game 23-13. Crabtree caught his first and only touchdown of the season against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.|$|E
25|$|The Spurs and Heat would {{alternate}} {{wins the}} first six games in the series. In Game 6, the Spurs {{were on the verge}} of winning their fifth NBA title. San Antonio was up five points with 28 seconds to go in regulation. An unlikely and uncharacteristic series of mishaps would doom the Spurs down the stretch, including the <b>benching</b> of Duncan by Popovich at the end of regulation with the Spurs on defense. The Heat missed their field goal attempt, but the undersized Spurs could not grab the defensive rebound. Chris Bosh rebounded the ball and Ray Allen then hit a 3-pointer to tie the game with five seconds left in regulation to send it to overtime, during which the Spurs were defeated 103–100. In Game 7, San Antonio jumped out to a lead early and kept the game close the entire way. Toward the end of the game, however, and despite a 24-point, 12 rebound effort, Duncan failed to convert on two attempts to tie the game: a missed layup and missed tip-in that allowed LeBron James to hit a jumper and increase the Heat's lead to 92–88. After a steal from Ginóbili, James hit two free throws after being fouled by Duncan, and when Ginóbili missed a subsequent 3-pointer, Dwyane Wade hit one out of two from the free throw line to put the game on ice, as the Heat would win their second straight championship.|$|E
500|$|The New York Sun {{reported}} that the <b>benching</b> was due to Pipp's struggles against left-handed pitchers, as southpaw George Mogridge was the scheduled starting pitcher for the Senators on June 2.

According to another story, supported by Gehrig's wife, Pipp {{was not at the}} game on June 2 because he was gambling on horse racing at a race track. His son Tom denied this rumor, stating that his father never bet on horses. [...] When interviewed by Sports Illustrated, Pipp's own children disagreed on the reason for their father's <b>benching,</b> believing it was either due to Pipp being beaned, or struggling.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{perforated}} <b>bench</b> {{is to reduce the}} air humidity beneath the plant canopy without excessive energy consumption. A <b>bench</b> heating system with heating pipes under a perforated <b>bench</b> with skirts creates an airflow through the <b>bench</b> openings due to buoyancy forces. Because the heated air is relatively dry compared to the surrounding air, it has a moisture absorbing and transporting capacity. The moisture transporting capacity will be decrease, thereby reducing the advantages of the perforated <b>bench,</b> if airflow rate is impeded by the <b>bench</b> structure, plant shape or leaf area index. Thus the airflow rate is of importance for the performance of a perforated <b>bench.</b> In an experimental setup the airflow rate was determined for different perforated <b>bench</b> designs with and without plants. Measurements were carried out with five different plant types on four <b>bench</b> designs. It was found that the airflow rate was effected by the design of the perforated <b>bench,</b> but on the same type of <b>bench</b> the effect of plant type and leaf area index was insignificant.
