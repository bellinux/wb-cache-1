500|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is on a <b>{{business}}</b> <b>call</b> {{with the}} investors {{and members of}} the business venture he is up for. Many distractions from the background make the call difficult. At the end of the day, Jim apologizes, but then hears the person on the phone saying this is not working out. Meanwhile, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) convinces several {{of the men in the}} office to grow mustaches for [...] "Movember". He says he is doing this to support the cure for prostate cancer but is actually using it for a chance to socialize more with the office, to no avail. Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) later shows Erin his mustache, but she finds it repulsive. He shaves it off shortly after that.|$|E

[...] She was beginning to be irritated with this man a little. [...] "I told him I had been very lucky," [...] she said suddenly despondent, missing Anthony's masterful manner, that something arbitrary and tender which, after the first scare, she had accustomed herself {{to look forward to}} with pleasurable apprehension. He was contemplating her rather blankly. She had not taken off her outdoor things, hat, gloves. She was like a caller. And she had a movement suggesting the end of a not very satisfactory <b>business</b> <b>call.</b> [...] "Perhaps it would be just as well if we went ashore. Time yet." ...|$|E
60|$|Jacobus having {{put me in}} mind of his wealthy brother I {{concluded}} I {{would pay}} that <b>business</b> <b>call</b> at once. I had by that time heard {{a little more of}} him.

6000|$|He rose as Harcourt entered. [...] "I didn't {{let them}} {{announce}} {{me to the}} ladies," [...] he said, [...] "as I have some important business with you first, and we may find it necessary that I should take the next train back to town. You remember that {{a few weeks ago}} I offered to look into the matter of those slanders against you. I apprehended it would be a trifling matter of envy or jealousy on the part of your old associates or neighbors which could be put straight with a little good feeling; but I must be frank with you, Harcourt, and say at the beginning that {{it turns out to be}} an infernally ugly <b>business.</b> <b>Call</b> it conspiracy if you like, or organized hostility, I'm afraid it will require a lawyer rather than an arbitrator to manage it, and the sooner the better.
