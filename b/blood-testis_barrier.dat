40|$|The {{gastro-intestinal}} tract is {{an ecosystem}} containing trillions of commensal bacteria living in symbiosis with the host. These microbiota modulate {{a variety of}} our physiological processes, including production of vitamins, absorption of nutrients {{and development of the}} immune system. One of their major functions is to fortify the intestinal barrier, thereby helping to prevent pathogens and harmful substances from crossing into the general circulation. Recently, effects of these microbiota on other blood-tissue barriers have also been reported. Here, we review the evidence indicating that gut bacteria play a role in regulating the blood-brain and <b>blood-testis</b> <b>barriers.</b> The underlying mechanisms include control of the expression of tight junction proteins by fermentation products such as butyrate, which also influences the activity of histone deacetylase...|$|R
40|$|Multidrug {{resistance}} (MDR) {{in cancer}} cells is a phenotype whereby cells display reduced sensitivity to anticancer drugs, {{based on a}} variety of mechanisms, including an increase in drug efflux, the reduction of drug uptake, the activation of cell growth and survival signaling, the promotion of DNA repair, and the inhibition of apoptosis signaling. Increased expression of the plasma membrane drug efflux pumps, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, is involved in MDR. P-Glycoprotein/ABCB 1 {{is a member of the}} ABC transporter family, and facilitates the efflux of various anticancer drugs, including anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, taxanes, and kinase inhibitors, from cells. P-Glycoprotein is also expressed in normal tissues and cells, including the kidney, liver, colon, and adrenal gland, to transport and/or secrete substrates and at the blood-brain, blood-placenta, and <b>blood-testis</b> <b>barriers</b> to protect these tissues from toxic substances. To understand the mechanistic functions of P-glycoprotein and to overcome MDR, investigators have identified the substrates and competitive inhibitors of P-glycoprotein. Recently, we and other groups reported associations between cellular signaling pathways and the expression, stability, degradation, localization, and activity of P-glycoprotein. The present review summarizes the currently available information about the transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of P-glycoprotein expression and function...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{its unique}} {{physical}} and chemical properties, tungsten has been increasingly utilized {{in a variety of}} civilian and military applications. This expanded use also raises the risk of human exposure through internalization by various routes. In most cases the toxicological and carcinogenic properties of these tungsten-based compounds are not known nor are the dissolution biokinetics and ultimate fate of the associated metals. Using a laboratory rodent model system designed to assess the health effects of embedded metals, and a tungsten alloy comprised of tungsten (91. 1 %), nickel (6. 0 %), and cobalt (2. 9 %), we investigated the tissue distribution patterns of the metals over a six month period. Despite its perceived insolubility, tungsten rapidly solubilized from the implanted metal fragments, as did nickel and cobalt. All three metals distributed systemically over time with extremely elevated levels of all three metals found in kidney, liver, and spleen. Unexpectedly, tungsten was found to cross the blood-brain and <b>blood-testis</b> <b>barriers</b> and localize in those tissues. These results, along with recent reports suggesting that tungsten is a tumor promoter, raises serious concerns as to the long-term health effects of exposure to tungsten and tungsten-based compounds...|$|R
25|$|The {{function}} of the <b>blood–testis</b> <b>barrier</b> (red highlight in diagram above) may be to prevent an auto-immune reaction. Mature sperm (and their antigens) arise long after immune tolerance is established in infancy. Therefore, since sperm are antigenically different from self tissue, a male animal can react immunologically to his own sperm. In fact, {{he is capable of}} making antibodies against them.|$|E
25|$|Spermatozoa are {{protected}} from the male's immune system by the <b>blood-testis</b> <b>barrier.</b> However, spermatozoa are deposited into the female in semen, which is mostly the secretions of the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bulbourethral glands. In this way antibodies generated by the male are deposited into the female along with spermatozoa. Because of this and the extensive travel in the female reproductive tract, spermatozoa are susceptible to anti-sperm antibodies generated by the male in addition to waiting anti-sperm antibodies generated by the female.|$|E
25|$|FSH stimulates {{both the}} {{production}} of androgen binding protein (ABP) by Sertoli cells, {{and the formation of}} the <b>blood-testis</b> <b>barrier.</b> ABP is essential to concentrating testosterone in levels high enough to initiate and maintain spermatogenesis. Intratesticular testosterone levels are 20–100 or 50–200 times higher than the concentration found in blood, although there is variation over a 5- to 10-fold range amongst healthy men. FSH may initiate the sequestering of testosterone in the testes, but once developed only testosterone is required to maintain spermatogenesis. However, increasing the levels of FSH will increase {{the production of}} spermatozoa by preventing the apoptosis of type A spermatogonia. The hormone inhibin acts to decrease the levels of FSH. Studies from rodent models suggest that gonadotropins (both LH and FSH) support the process of spermatogenesis by suppressing the proapoptotic signals and therefore promote spermatogenic cell survival.|$|E
40|$|Breast cancer {{resistance}} protein (ABCG 2), {{the newest}} ABC transporter, was discovered independently by three {{groups in the}} late 1990 s. ABCG 2 is widely distributed in the body with expression in the brain, intestine, and liver, among others. ABCG 2 {{plays an important role}} by effluxing drugs at the blood–brain, <b>blood–testis,</b> and maternal–fetal <b>barriers</b> and in the efflux of xenobiotics at the small intestine and kidney proximal tubule brush border and liver canalicular membranes. ABCG 2 transports a wide variety of substrates including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, antibiotics, and many anticancer agents and is one contributor to multidrug resistance in cancer cells. Quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models and structure–activity relationships (SARs) are often employed to predict ABCG 2 substrates and inhibitors prior to in vitro and in vivo studies. QSAR models correlate in vivo biological activity to physicochemical properties of compounds while SARs attempt to explain chemical moieties or structural features that contribute to or are detrimental to the biological activity. Most ABCG 2 datasets available for in silico modeling are comprised of congeneric series of compounds; the results from one series usually cannot be applied to another series of compounds. This review will focus on in silico models in the literature used for the prediction of ABCG 2 substrates and inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{engineered}} nanoparticles {{has risen}} exponentially {{over the last}} decade. Applications are manifold and include utilisation in industrial goods as well as medical and consumer products. Gold and silver nanoparticles {{play an important role}} in the current increase of nanoparticle usage. However, our understanding concerning possible side effects of this increased exposure to particles, which are frequently in the same size regime as medium sized biomolecules and accessorily possess highly active surfaces, is still incomplete. That particularly applies to reproductive aspects, were defects can be passed onto following generations. This review gives a brief overview of the most recent findings concerning reprotoxicological effects. The here presented data elucidate how composition, size and surface modification of nanoparticles influence viablility and functionality of reproduction relevant cells derived from various animal models. While in vitro cultured embryos displayed no toxic effects after the microinjection of gold and silver nanoparticles, sperm fertility parameters deteriorated after co-incubation with ligand free gold nanoparticles. However, the effect could be alleviated by bio-coating the nanoparticles, which even applies to silver and silver-rich alloy nanoparticles. The most sensitive test system appeared to be in vitro oocyte maturation showing a dose-dependent response towards protein (BSA) coated gold–silver alloy and silver nanoparticles leading up to complete arrest of maturation. Recent biodistribution studies confirmed that nanoparticles gain access to the ovaries and also penetrate the <b>blood–testis</b> and placental <b>barrier.</b> Thus, the design of nanoparticles with increased biosafety is highly relevant for biomedical applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} and function of intercellular tight (occluding) junctions, which constitute the anatomical basis for highly regulated interfaces between tissue compartments such as the <b>blood-testis</b> and blood-brain <b>barriers,</b> are well known. Details of the synthesis and assembly of tight junctions, however, {{have been difficult to}} determine primarily because no model for study of these processes has been recognized. Primary cultures of brain capillary endothelial cells are proposed as a model in which events of the synthesis and assembly of tight junctions can be examined by monitoring morphological features of each step in freeze-fracture replicas of the endothelial cell plasma membrane. Examination of replicas of non-confluent monolayers of endothelial cells reveals the following intramembrane structures proposed as `markers' for the sequential events of synthesis and assembly of zonulae occludentes: (1) development of surface contours consisting of elongate terraces and furrows (valleys) orientated parallel to the axis of cytoplasmic extensions of spreading endothelial cells, (2) appearance of small circular PF face depressions (or volcano-like protrusions on the EF face) that represent cytoplasmic vesicle-plasma membrane fusion sites, which are positioned in linear arrays along the contour furrows, (3) appearance of 13 - 15 nm intramembrane particles at the perimeter of the vesicle fusion sites, and (4) alignment of these intramembrane particles into the long, parallel, anastomosed strands characteristic of mature tight junctions. These structural features of brain endothelial cells in monolayer culture constitute the morphological expression of: (1) reshaping the cell surface to align future junction-containing regions with those of adjacent cells, (2) delivery and insertion of newly synthesized junctional intramembrane particles into regions of the plasma membrane where tight junctions will form, and (3) aggregation and alignment of tight junction intramembrane particles into the complex interconnected strands of mature zonulae occludentes. The distribution of filipin-sterol complex-free regions on the PF intramembrane fracture face of junction-forming endothelial plasmalemmae corresponds precisely to the furrows, aligned vesicle fusion sites and anastomosed strands of tight junctional elements. To test the functional significance of these morphological features of junction-forming cells and to validate the interpretation that they are reliable indicators of the stages of tight junction genesis, primary cultures of bovine brain capillary endothelium were treated with 25 [mu]g/ml of Cytochalasin-D or 0. 25 mg/ml of n-ethylmaleimide (Sigma Chemical Co.) in order to prevent cytoskeletal mediation of surface contouring (step 1) or to inhibit vesicle fusion with the plasmalemma (step 2) and thereby prevent junction formation as a consequence of failure of the vesicle fusions to insert tight junctional intramembrane particles into the plasma membrane. Examination of platinum replicas of freeze-fractured control and treated endothelial monolayer cultures confirmed the absence of surface contours in Cytochalasin-D-treated cells, which exhibited no zonulae occludentes, and also clearly showed that n-ethylmaleimide-treated cells, which lacked tight junctions, did not have the rich endowment of vesicle fusion sites (and IMPs) which were conspicuous in control cells. Demonstration of the failure of MDCK cells to form tight junctions when cultured in the presence of 5 - 10 [mu]g/ml of cycloheximide (Griepp et al., 1983) lends further support for the schemata proposed above. Advantages of this model include: (1) all stages of de novo tight junction formation are present in each monolayer culture, and (2) cultures possess vast areas of tight junction-containing membrane which are easily sampled by freeze-fracture. This model will provide the basis for future attempts to identify the signals that regulate tight junction formation, and will facilitate studies to characterize the protein(s) of the endothelial tight junctions, the messages (m-RNA) that code for them, and ultimately, the genes bearing their blueprint...|$|R

50|$|Sperm are {{immunogenic}} - that is {{they will}} cause an autoimmune reaction if transplanted from the testis {{into a different}} part of the body. This has been demonstrated in experiments using rats by Lansteiner (1899) and Metchinikoff (1900), mice and guinea pigs.

50|$|The {{presence}} of anti-sperm antibodies in infertile men was first reported in 1954 by Rumke and Wilson.
