500|$|Historian Alex von Tunzelmann {{gave the}} film a mixed review in The Guardian: [...] "The Girl {{is perhaps a}} more {{effective}} piece of film-making than Hitchcock, though it is also more questionable in its portrayal of the directorhe film depicts [...] accurately, though Jones's Hitchcock {{appears to be more}} gratified by the spectacle than the real Hitch was". Simon quotes Donald Spoto's book The Dark Side of Genius (1983), in which Hedren told Spoto [...] " [...] was terribly upset by all this"; screenwriter Evan Hunter said, [...] "e wanted to shoot it, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> him didn't want to shoot it, and everybody could hear how nervous he was". Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film should not be viewed in terms of truths or untruths, but instead as [...] "an exquisitely lurid morality play in the Hitchcock style", calling The Girl [...] "an original masterpiece that pays tribute to Hitchcock's talent and vision".|$|E
500|$|Eve Myles {{previously}} {{appeared in}} the 2005 Doctor Who episode [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] as Gwyneth, a 19th-century clairvoyant. Gwyneth had {{a connection to the}} Cardiff Rift, which later became a central plot device in Torchwood. In response to questions about the similarity of the characters' names, Russell T Davies denied they were connected, stating they are [...] "just two names beginning with [...] "G"." [...] Subsequently however, Davies' 2008 Doctor Who episode [...] "Journey's End" [...] alluded to a familial relationship between the characters (with the Doctor specifically asking if Gwen was a family name and Gwen replying that it was), explaining their physical resemblance as the result of [...] "spatial genetic multiplicity". Eve Myles said of the two characters, [...] "it was never on the cards as such, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> {{the back of my head}} always said that they were going to be connected somehow." [...] Davies explained that the relationship between the characters is not literal, stating that [...] "It's not familial as we understand it" [...] instead characterising spatial genetic multiplicity as [...] "an echo and repetition of physical traits across a Time Rift." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Harrison of The New Republic {{believes}} that the writers deliberately broke up any main character who was approaching a borderline life-changing relationship because [...] "The ones the Friends were really meant to be with were, after all, the other Friends". Because Monica and Joey were initially conceived as the show's two most sexual characters, Crane and Kauffman had originally intended {{for them to be}} the show's main couple, before ultimately replacing them with Ross and Rachel. The idea of Monica and Joey was abandoned once the role of Joey was cast; actor Matt LeBlanc approached his character using much more of a [...] "big brother vibe" [...] in terms of Joey's relationship with Cox's character as opposed to a romantic one, which the writers ultimately preferred. According to Allison Piwowarski of Bustle, Monica and Joey's relationship would have greatly altered the trajectory of the entire series, having life-changing effects on its characters. Summarizing the role of Monica in the series, Martin Gitlin wrote in his book The Greatest Sitcoms of All Time that while her friends [...] "were ... just out {{to make the most of}} their social lives", Monica [...] "sought to keep the others in line" [...] while searching for [...] "Mr. Right", who surprisingly turns out to be close friend Chandler. Several years before Monica and Chandler became romantically involved, Cox once joked in an interview that if her character were to ever have sex with another main character, it would most likely be Chandler. Crane and Kauffman had never intended to pair off Monica and Chandler with each other, and only decided to expand upon the idea of a relationship between the two friends upon realizing that viewers had [...] "fallen in love" [...] with the notion of Monica and Chandler as a couple. According to Robert Bianco of USA Today, [...] "Their affair came out of the blue and was supposed to quickly return there â€” <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the relationship clicked with viewers." [...] The idea of Monica and Chandler's romantic arc originally surfaced much earlier in the series from writers Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan, who first observed the characters' chemistry in the season two episode [...] "The One Where Ross Finds Out", in which an idle and unemployed Monica is temporarily acting as Chandler's personal trainer. However, Silveri's suggestion was initially vetoed by the other writers, who felt that it was simply too soon to introduce another main couple to Friends having just recently paired off Ross and Rachel. Following Ross and Rachel's break up in season three, the writers felt that the timing was just about right to officially introduce Monica and Chandler as a couple, deciding that Friends [...] "can't simply rest on this one [...] relationship", while believing that Monica and Chandler's would ultimately provide a fun opportunity for the writers to explore brand new storylines.|$|E

2500|$|The early ballads {{are also}} quite clear on Robin Hood's social status: he is a yeoman. While the precise {{meaning of this}} term changed over time, {{including}} free retainers of an aristocrat and small landholders, it always referred to commoners. The essence {{of it in the}} present context was 'neither a knight nor a peasant or [...] "husbonde" [...] <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> between'. Artisans (such as millers) were among those regarded as 'yeomen' in the 14th century. From the 16th century on, there were attempts to elevate Robin Hood to the nobility and in two extremely influential plays, Anthony Munday presented him {{at the very end of}} the 16th century as the Earl of Huntingdon, as he is still commonly presented in modern times.|$|E
