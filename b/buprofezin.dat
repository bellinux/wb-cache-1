50|$|Adelphocoris lineolatus are {{commonly}} known as the alfalfa plant bug, due to the excessive amount of damage they cause to alfalfa crops around the world. In order to decrease and prevent the rapid dispersal of A. lineolatus certain control methods need to be implemented, to decrease the amount of ecological and economic damage these pests cause. Insecticides are not commonly used to decrease or stop Adelphocoris lineolatus from infesting crops because these insects have become resistant to certain chemicals present in insecticides. A. lineolatus nymphs have become resistant to the following chemical ingredients commonly used in insecticides, mono-methanimidamide, fufenozide, <b>buprofezin,</b> azad irachtin, and triazophos. An alternative from these chemicals would be to use insecticides made of pyrethroid, neonicotinoid, carbamate, avermectin, or organophosphate since alfalfa plant bugs are not resistant to these chemicals. Insecticides can be an effective and efficient method of controlling pests, but they do cause a great deal of damage to our environment and we should refrain from using them if possible.|$|E

Bioassays with appropriate life-stages were used to investigate the status of resistance to two pyrethroid insecticides (bifenthrin and fenpropathrin), two organophosphates (OPs) (formothion and triazophos) and an insect growth regulator (<b>buprofezin).</b> All four strains showed significant resistance to pyrethroids (57 - to 360 -fold) and OPs (20 - to 310 -fold). Resistance to <b>buprofezin</b> was found only in a strain from Izmir. Total non-specific esterase activities were 7. 4 - 11 -fold greater than in an in secticide-susceptible strain, and were likely to account, in part at least, for resistance to pyrethroids. Inhibition assays with acetylcholinesterase also implicated target-site modification as a mechanism of resistance to OPs.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique for the determination of residues of the pyrimethanil, pirimicarb and <b>buprofezin</b> pesticides in surface waters from irrigated areas, with analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The optimized method used a 100 µm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber, agitation speed of the sample of 900 rpm and pH 7. 0. Extraction and desorption times were 30 and 7 min, respectively. Linearity was achieved in the concentration range 0. 1 - 4. 0 µg L- 1, and coefficients of determination (R²) were > 0. 991. Precision, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD), was < 15 %, and limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were in the ranges 0. 04 - 0. 1 µg L- 1 and 0. 1 - 0. 2 µg L- 1, respectively. Surface water samples were collected from irrigated regions of the Platô de Neópolis in Sergipe State (Brazil) and from Distrito de Irrigação Senador Nilo Coelho in Pernambuco State (Brazil). Concentrations of <b>buprofezin</b> were < 0. 14 µg L- 1, while those of pirimicarb were lower than the limit of quantification (LOQ). Pyrimethanil was not detected in the samples...|$|E
40|$|Reduction {{of populations}} of the B strain (poinsettia) of sweetpotato {{whitefly}} (SPWF), Bemisia tabaci Gennadius, resulted from applications of <b>buprofezin</b> or amitraz to cotton in central Arizona (Maricopa, AZ). Control was fair to good control for this insect. However, yields of seed cotton in treated plots were not increased significantly compared to untreated plots, following three applications of these insecticides during the season.

40|$|Whiteflies {{are serious}} pests of cotton, melons, and winter {{vegetables}} in Arizona’s low deserts. Successful management of whiteflies requires an integrated approach, a critical element {{of which is}} routine pest monitoring. In this paper we report findings of our 1999 investigations of resistance of Arizona whiteflies to insect growth regulators (IGRs) and chloronicotinyl insecticides. Whiteflies collected from cotton fields, melon fields and greenhouses were tested for susceptibility to imidacloprid (Admire/Provado), and two other chloronicotinyl insecticides, acetamiprid and thiamethoxam, and to two insect growth regulators (IGRs), <b>buprofezin</b> (Applaud) and pyriproxyfen (Knack). Contrasts of 1999 and 1998 results indicated increased susceptibilities, on average, to both imidacloprid and <b>buprofezin</b> of whiteflies collected from cotton. A cropping system study showed that whiteflies collected from spring melons had significantly lower susceptibility to imidacloprid than those collected from cotton or fall melons. The opposite was found for pyriproxyfen, to which whiteflies from cotton and fall melons had lower susceptibility than those from spring melons. As in 1998, whiteflies with reduced susceptibility to imidacloprid continue {{to be found in}} certain locations, particularly in spring melon fields and greenhouses. Results of our laboratory bioassays on susceptibility of Arizona whiteflies to chloronicotinyl insecticides provided evidence of a low order cross-resistance between imidacloprid, acetamiprid and thiamethoxam. Monitoring in 1999 provided the first evidence of reduced susceptibility of Arizona whiteflies to pyriproxyfen...|$|E
40|$|Different {{methods have}} been used to control the citrus leafminer (Phyllocnistis citrella) but the {{chemical}} and the microbial controls are realized to be the best and effective methods. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of three different commercial chemical insecticides (Avant, <b>Buprofezin</b> and Pyriproxifen) with 2 spray methods (leaf-dip and topical spray) at 24 and 48 h of post treatment to citrus leafminer. Analysis of variance showed that there were significant differences between treatment and untreated control groups. Among the treatments, Avant pesticide was more effective (35. 58 %) than <b>Buprofezin</b> (21. 25 %) and Pyriproxifen (19. 31 %) on citrus leafminer larval mortality. The results indicated that there were significant differences between two spray methods and leaf-dip was more effective than topical spray on citrus leafminer larval mortality. No significant difference in effectiveness of was found between periods of post spraying in citrus leafminer larval mortality. The results obtained at the present study suggest that the Avant chemical pesticide can be account as an effective tools in controlling the spreading of citrus leafminer in citrus growing regions in north of Iran. As there are no previous reports concerning the effect of these commercial chemical insecticides on natural enemies of citrus leafminer, further research in this area and also a field analysis to confirm their suitability for the pest management is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Most {{experimental}} treatments effectively reduced Bemisia tabaci [sweetpotato whitefly (WF) {{also known}} as silverleaf WF, B. argentifolii] adults and eggs in cantaloupes relative to the untreated check at 6 days after treatment of each of five applications.

40|$|Abstract In {{the context}} of an {{integrated}} control strategy for house fly, Musca domestica, development within an urban solid waste treatment plant, tests were conducted to evaluate the sterilisation of M. domestica adults by feeding them with Insect growth regulator (IGR) products commonly used for larvae control. Products containing triflumuron, <b>buprofezin,</b> hexaflumuron, and diflubenzuron were evaluated in the laboratory using insects collected in a waste treatment plant. Each test was conducted on pairs of house fly adults aged 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 days. Environmental conditions were recorded during the tests; the tempera-ture was 24 °C + 1 °C and the RH was 65 % + 10 %. Each treatment was replicated three times and consisted of exposing ten pairs of house flies to contact with discs of filter paper treated with 0. 1 % or 0. 75 % of each active ingredient diluted in a water solution containing 40 % sugar as an attractant. The pairs of house flies were exposed to the treated discs for 3 to 6 days in a cage of 4. 67 l. The results show that some IGRs (diflubenzuron, hexaflumuron, and triflumuron) sterilise 100 % of eggs laid by couples of Musca domestica adults aged 1 day. The sterilisation effect is similar in adults that come into contact with these IGRs for up to one week after their emergence.

40|$|The section 18 granted {{for the use}} {{of insect}} growth {{regulators}} in 1996 in Arizona provided an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the efficacy of the materials. Knack® (Pyriproxyfen) and Applaud® (<b>Buprofezin)</b> both demonstrated excellent control of whitefly in this demonstration. Efficacy of the insect growth regulators was monitored by using the "Ellsworth-Naranjo" methods of measuring adult and nymph whitefly numbers. This method provided good tracking of the populations throughout the period monitored. The areas treated were cotton variety trials both pima and upland. On the upland trial whitefly infestation data was collected on each variety. Hairy leaf varieties tended to have higher whitefly numbers of both adults and nymphs...|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Faculty of Sciences, University of Luton, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThe incidence, influencing factors and mechanisms of resistance to insecticides {{from a range of}} chemical groups were examined in UK and European populations of the glasshouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood). Toxicological assessments of populations from a range of plant production glasshouses and comparisons with the responses of a laboratory susceptible strain disclosed levels of resistance to pyrethroid, organophosphate, insect growth regulator (IGR) and neonicotinoid insecticides. Responses to conventional compounds indicated varying levels of resistance, potentially reflecting disparate usage between collection sites. All strains examined possessed resistance to the IGR, buprofezin; some populations were virtually immune to this commonly used control agent. Selection experiments demonstrated reciprocal crossresistance between <b>buprofezin</b> and a further IGR, teflubenzuron, both of which are frequently incorporated into integrated pest management (IPM) programmes for this species. Results for the leading neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, revealed resistance in both UK and European strains, representing the first documented cases of neonicotinoid resistance in this species worldwide, and the first in any insect species within the UK. The lethal effects of vapour emitted by applications of <b>buprofezin</b> and the anti-feedant effects of imidacloprid were demonstrated in T. vaporariorum for the first time. The potential consequences of these factors for both the control and selection of resistance were highlighted. Mechanistic studies using electrophoresis and kinetic spectrophotometer readings showed that neither non-specific esterases nor modified acetylcholinesterases were involved with resistance to either pyrethroid or specific organophosphate insecticides...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{repeated}} applications of <b>buprofezin</b> and acephate, at concentrations ranging from 0. 25 to 1. 0 kg ha- 1, on activities of cellulases, amylase, and invertase in unamended and nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium (NPK) fertilizer-amended soil planted with cotton was studied. The nontarget effect of selected insecticides, when applied once, twice, or thrice on soil enzyme activities, was dose-dependent; the activities decreased with increasing concentrations of insecticides. However, {{there was a}} rapid decline in activities of enzymes after three repeated applications of insecticides in unamended or NPK-amended soil.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} on spring cantaloupes from 2004 - 2006 to evaluate two adult and nymph based thresholds used for timing the application of Oberon (spiromesifen) and Courier (<b>buprofezin)</b> in spring melons for controlling whiteflies. The results of these studies demonstrate that these selective insecticides offer melon growers effective foliar management alternatives for controlling whiteflies. Both Oberon and Courier provided economic control of whitefly nymphs and significantly prevented sooty mold contamination when applied after populations exceeded either an adult threshold of 2 adults per leaf or an immature threshold or 0. 5 large nymph per 2 cm² leaf disc. Applied at these thresholds, both compounds provided consistent residual suppression of whitefly immature population growth for 21 - 28 days under spring growing conditions...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} {{susceptibility}} to insecticides of whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) collected from cotton, melons and ornamental plants during the 2004 season. No major problems with field performance of insecticides against whiteflies were observed or reported in 2004 in Arizona cotton, vegetables, or melons. However, monitoring revealed further statewide reduction in susceptibility to pyriproxyfen (Knack®) {{and showed that}} whiteflies possessing pyriproxyfen resistance could be detected in all low desert areas of the state. Susceptibility to <b>buprofezin</b> (Applaud®/Courier®) has not changed significantly since 1997. Mean susceptibility to synergized pyrethroids (e. g., Danitol® + Orthene®) has increased strikingly on a statewide basis since 1995 though highly resistant whiteflies were detected in some collections from cotton, melons and ornamentals. Whiteflies from throughout Arizona continued to be highly susceptible to imidacloprid (Admire®/Provado®). However, susceptibility to the related neonicotinoid insecticide, acetamiprid (Intruder®) varied widely and was lowest in collections from melons and greenhouse plants. Whiteflies from cotton that were least susceptibile to acetamiprid were significantly less susceptible to a second neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam (Actara®/Centric®/Platinum®). The most worrisome findings of our 2004 studies stemmed from detection of a strain of B. tabaci, at a retail nursery, that was essentially unaffected by pyriproxyfen in egg bioassays. It also possessed strikingly reduced susceptibility to acetamiprid, <b>buprofezin,</b> mixtures of fenpropathrin and acephate, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam. This strain {{was found to be}} a biotype of B. tabaci previously undescribed in the US, the Q biotype. We cannot predict with accuracy the timecourse of future resistance problems or the spread and impact of this new whitefly biotype. However, our findings point to the need to formulate contingency plans for management of resistance, in order to insure that Arizona agriculture does not revisit the severe whitefly control problems experienced in the past...|$|E
