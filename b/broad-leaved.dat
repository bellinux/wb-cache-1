40|$|ABSTRACT] Forest {{classes for}} global land cover data is {{important}} for global environmental studies. However, {{it is difficult to}} correctly classify needle-leaves forest and <b>broad-leaves</b> forest using phenology information extracted from observation data as a nadir view. In this study, we attempted to differntiate needle-leaves and <b>broad-leaves</b> forests using MOD 09 GA and MYD 09 GA. To produce pseudo multidirectional satellite data, we selected several days of data with scannig widths overtapping along the crosstrack direction. We used the pseudo multidirectional data sets to study reflectance on four bands, as well as the variation with solar zenith and relative azimuth for NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and GVI (the green chlorophyll index). Data selection followed criteria aimed to reduce as much as possible the influence of viewing direction and terrain conditions. We found that NDVI and GVI change depending on the solar zenith and relative azimuth. Using data in limited ranges of solar zenith and relative azimuth, {{it was not possible to}} clearly show differences between the characteristics of needle-leaves forest and <b>broad-leaves</b> forest from pseudo multidirectional observation data. However, we found differences for both NDVI and GVI between nadir and stant data depending in the surface state of the forest...|$|R

5|$|For {{most of its}} distribution, B.integrifolia occurs {{only within}} about 50 {{kilometres}} (30mi) of the coast, where it typically occurs on poor quality sandy soils derived from sandstone. It grows near coastal cliffs and headlands, alongside river estuaries, and even on stabilised sand dunes. The temperature range for this area is around 0–30°C (30–85°F), with almost no frosts. The species can occur in pure stands, but is usually associated with other species such as Melaleuca quinquenervia (<b>broad-leaved</b> paperbark).|$|E
5|$|In {{tropical}} {{regions with}} a monsoon or monsoon-like climate, where a drier {{part of the}} year alternates with a wet period as in the Amazon rainforest, different species of <b>broad-leaved</b> trees dominate the forest, some of them being deciduous. In tropical regions with a drier savanna climate and insufficient rainfall to support dense forests, the canopy is not closed, and plenty of sunshine reaches the ground which is covered with grass and scrub.

Creation of tribenuron-methyl resistant hybrids would enable the use of a wider palette of herbicides for sunflower, more efficient chemical control of Cirsium arvense and more economically profitable post-emergence control of some annual <b>broad-leaves</b> weeds in sunflower. Original populations SURES- 1 and SURES- 2 are homozygous for resistance to tribenuron-methyl. F 1 generations produced from the crossings are completely resistant to tribenuron-methyl, pointing out to dominant way of inheritance of this trait. Studies on the exact number of genes controlling the resistance are in progress. Tribenuron-methyl resistance was transferred from original populations into a number of female and male inbred lines of cultivated sunflower. These inbred lines could enable creation of a number of hybrids resistant to tribenuron-methyl.

40|$|Understanding {{ecosystem}} functioning in a farmland context {{by considering the}} variety of ecological strategies employed by arthropods is a core challenge in ecology and conservation science. We adopted a functional approach in {{an assessment of the}} relationship between three functional plant groups (grasses, <b>broad-leaves</b> and legumes) and the arthropod community in winter wheat fields in a Mediterranean dryland context. We sampled the arthropod community as thoroughly as possible with a combination of suction catching and flight-interception trapping. All specimens were identified to the appropriate taxonomic level (family, genus or species) and classified according to their form of feeding: chewing-herbivores, sucking-herbivores, flower-consumers, omnivores, saprovores, parasitoids or predators. We found, a richer plant community favoured a greater diversity of herbivores and, in turn, a richness of herbivores and saprovores enhanced the communities of their natural enemies, which supports the classical trophic structure hypothesis. Grass cover had a positive effect on sucking-herbivores, saprovores and their natural enemies and is probably due to grasses’ ability to provide, either directly or indirectly, alternative resources or simply by offering better environmental conditions. By including legumes in agroecosystems we can improve the conservation of beneficial arthropods like predators or parasitoids, and enhance the provision of ecosystem services such as natural pest controlPeer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R

40|$|Today, {{due to the}} {{problems}} caused by herbicide application, {{there is a strong}} interest in developing alternative methods of weed control. To study the effects of soil solarization, barley straw mulch on weed flora, a field experiment was conducted at Research station of faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad during the growing season of 2007 - 2008. This experiment was based on a randomized complete block design arranged as a split plot with three replications. Soil solarization treatment (Clear and black polyethylene and non-solarized control) and various straw mulch rates (0, 300 and 600 gm- 2) were arranged on the main plots and sub plots, respectively. Seventeen weed species was identified by studying weed population which were mainly annual <b>broad-leaves</b> species. Results indicated that solarization with clear and black sheets reduced weed density and biomass after removing polyethylene sheets. Solarization with clear sheets reduced weed density and biomass, after application of straw mulch. Straw mulch had no significant effect on weed density, but in last sampling date it reduced biomass up to 44. 15 % and 52. 90 % in 300 and 600 gm- 2, respectively.

Patches of susceptible black-grass were created by setting protective canvas on few areas (from 0, 5 up to 32 m²), during herbicide spraying and they were removed afterwards. Those patches were disposed along rays starting from the introduction point at distances from 2 to 128 meters. In those patches, local black-grass grew regularly {{and was able to}} receive some pollen from the resistant individuals, located in the centered emitting area.

40|$|We present {{applications}} of infrared thermograph to the direct observation of water transport in stems of woody species. Presently, the method gives only qualitative {{information on the}} path of sap movement along the stem, and therefore, does not replace any of the common quantitative methods of sap flow measurement. Nevertheless, the thermal imaging technique provides a novel approach {{to the study of the}} ascent of sap and could have a role in supporting more quantitative methods. Thermography permits visualization of the thermal variations of a fairly large area of the stem in real time, and hence, is well suited for spatial analysis of sap movement. Three experiments were carried out during the summers of 1991 and 1992, with the following objectives: to define the sap flow distribution in the active annual rings; to identify grain anomalies in the sap wood; and to study the consequences of induced embolism {{on the path of}} sap flow. Altogether, we tested more than 10 woody species (<b>broad-leaves</b> and conifers) either in natural conditions or in the nursery. We found considerable differences in the spatial distribution of sap flow not only between species and individuals but also within a single tree. Grain anomalies or embolized zones in the xylem, which are easily demonstrated, often further modify the path of sap flow. The irregularity of sapwood dimensions and of sap flow among tree rings requires careful evaluation of the positioning of the probes when using methods for quantitative measurements...|$|R

40|$|Diversity, dominance, and {{stability}} of weeds {{are the most important}} ecological properties in agricultural systems, which influenced by management factors such as crop density, abundantly. This experiment was conducted in 2009 at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad Research Field. The experimental design was interval mapping with four levels of corn densities (5, 6, 7 and 9 plant. m- 2) and four levels of weed control (full-control, without control, <b>broad-leaves</b> control and grasses control). Weed sampling was done at 3 stages included beginning and end of critical period weed control and harvesting time. The results showed that the effect of plant density on species diversity was significant; some how the amount of Shanon and Simpson Indices were lowest in the 9 plant. m- 2 (0. 39 and 0. 45, respectively) and greatest in 5 plant. m- 2 (0. 84). The results also showed that the maximum amount of dominance index was observed in 9 plant. m- 2, that was seen in Echinochloa crus- galli and Convulvulus arvensis at the beginning of growing season, then in Solanum nigrum and Amaranthus retroflexus in the end of growing season. The amount of community dominance index in 9 plant. m- 2 was higher than other densities, and it decreased with decline of densities. {{based on the results of}} present experiment the linear relationship between plant species and area was found. The calculated amount of Alpha and Beta diversities. in a θ and β scales based on coefficients of this relationship were 0. 534 (four species per unit area) and 0. 29 (two species per unit area), respectively.

Before 1982,herbs had been dominant,sparsely dotted with shrubs. After 20 -year restoration of the vegetation,the vegetation showed significant changes in both forest coverage and species diversity. Forest coverage had increased to 93. 3 % in 1999 from 0. 4 % in 1982. The vegetation could be broadly classified into two groups: artificial forest,accounting for the most percent,and natural secondary forest. These two groups could be subdivided into 12 types. Based on the 2003 field work,The authors studied plant community composition and vertical structure. The results were as follows: 1) On the study plots were there about 150 species,of which 100, 49,and 47 grew in arbor layer and shrub layer and herb layer,respectively. Of 12 community types,the amount of species in shrub layer was larger than that of other two layers. As to the species richness in the different community types,Liquidambar formosana community showed the highest and Imperata cylindrical var. major community the least. The amount of species in arbor layer of artificial forest was smaller than those of natural Pinus massoniana forest,but no difference in understory. 2) Loropetalum chinense,Quercus fabric and Vaccinium bracteatum were dominant shrub species with a wide distribution. Three ferns Woodwardia japonica、Dryopteris atrata and Dicrannepteris dichotoma were dominant herb species. Lianas were sparse,but Milletlia reticulata were found in all forest types. 3) Up to now some natural regeneration species,such as Eurya muricata、Quercus fabri、Vaccinium bracteatum、Rhus chinensis、Adinandra bockiana,had grown in the arbor layer of artificial forests. Some herb species,such as Arundinella setosa、Miscanthus floridulus、Isachne globosa、Scirpus triqueter,which were dominant ones in the herb layer before the restoration of vegetation,disappeared now. 4) The vertical structure of natural Pinus massoniana community and Liquidambar formosana community showed more complex comparing with artificial forests. For the artificial forests,the conifer and <b>broad-leaves</b> mixed forest had a more complex structure.

5|$|After hatching, the nymphs {{fall from}} the {{branches}} to seek {{a crack in the}} soil where they can burrow, often to a depth of 10–40cm (4–16in), by digging with their large forelegs. Larger species of cicada like A.curvicosta are thought to spend 2–8 years underground, during which time they grow and feed through their rostrum on the sap from tree roots. They moult five times before emerging from the ground to shed their final shell. Although consistently taking place at night, the emergence of the population is diffusely spread over the season in comparison to the more high-density Australian species. The sex ratio is about 1.15males to every female, consistent throughout the emergence. The metabolic rate over a period of about 6.5hours during emergence of A.curvicosta is about 1.8times the resting metabolic rate of the adult. A South East Queensland study reported nymphs would emerge on most tree species but avoid Norfolk pine (Araucaria heterophylla) and <b>broad-leaved</b> paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia). The adults are usually found between November and May but are sometimes observed as early as September and until as late as June. They were recorded as appearing every year, mainly in December and January in western Sydney, with a similar 92-day emergence period from late November until late February recorded in South East Queensland. This makes it one of the last Australian cicadas to emerge each season. The nymph grips onto the tree bark with all of its legs, swallows air and redistributes haemolymph to split the cast down the center of its back. It then extracts its head and clypeus by hunching its body, and when these have emerged, arches back to draw the legs out of their casing. It then slowly unfolds its wings, finally bending forward and gripping onto the front of the shell to free its abdomen. Once free it hangs for hours more as the wings harden.|$|E
