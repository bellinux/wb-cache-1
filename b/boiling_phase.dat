Separate computational domains constructed for the solid and liquid regions are numerically coupled at the interface of the solid–liquid boundaries using the AVL-Code-Coupling-Interface (ACCI) feature. The <b>boiling</b> <b>phase</b> change process triggered by the dipping hot metal and the ensuing two-phase flow is handled using an Eulerian two-fluid method.

A comparison of the registered temperature readings at different monitoring locations with the numerical results generates an overall very good agreement and indicates the presence of intense non-uniformity in the temperature distribution within the solid.

At wall temperatures above the liquid boiling point, the vapour formation {{and the interaction}} of the vapour phase with the liquid flow field is determining the local cooling conditions of the workpiece. High temperature gradients can result in an inhomogeneous distribution of the final material properties (e. g. hardness). A multiphase flow and heat transfer model is utilized to simulate the local flow field and the resulting cooling conditions during quenching. The applied bubble-crowding approach is able to investigate the different <b>boiling</b> <b>phases</b> within one single numerical model.

30|$|An {{increase}} in the stability level of the ethanol sol occurred {{as a result of}} dynamic movement of ethanol molecules which were on <b>boiling</b> <b>phase.</b> It is estimated that the bubbles generated by ethanol could break and stir the TiO 2 particles, so the stability of photocatalyst sol could increase dramatically. On the contrary, decrease of aquadest sol stability at high temperatures was caused by the reagglomeration that occurs between TiO 2 particles. Based on these results, it can be concluded that for immobilization method which use lower temperature such as dip coating, usage of aquadest as dispersion medium is more favourable. On the other hand, for the immobilization method using higher temperature such as solvent evaporation, ethanol is better to be used as dispersion medium.

30|$|Those images {{also show}} that the two {{different}} methods gave out different results, where solvent evaporation method was seemed to produce immobilized titania which were distributed less evenly compared to dip coating method. In this regard, this occasion might be ascribed to the attachment process of titania to pumice surface which was different for each method. For the solvent evaporation method, high temperature was used to evaporate the dispersion medium leaving the titania on the pumice surface. In this case, the boiled solvent moved dynamically and (indirectly) stirred the mixture, thus making the attachment process of titania on pumice was very random. It explains why titania is less spotted on the pumice surface for the case of immobilized TiNT-SE (Fig.  6 c, d). However, solvent evaporation method had the advantage to leave all the particles of titania on the pumice, making the loss of titania became inconsiderable. Therefore, {{it was expected that}} solvent evaporation method would deliver the titania mostly not on the outer surface of pumice, but deeper into the inner pores of pumice (which would hardly be spotted by FE-SEM analysis). It could happen because of the high mobility of ethanol molecules (on <b>boiling</b> <b>phase)</b> which would give more energy to titania particles and drive them into deeper area of the pumice.|$|E

Over the years, {{the large amount of}} Geothermal fluids extracted (at present about 12, 000 tons per hour) to supply steam to the power plants has resulted in a reduction of pressures, changes in reservoir processes, and increased flow of cooler groundwater into the geothermal system.

In addition, the supply of deep hot waters has continued unabated, and perhaps has increased as reservoir pressure decreased.

50|$|If {{the heating}} process is {{relatively}} slow, the liquid has {{enough time to}} relax to an equilibrium state and the liquid follows the binodal curve, the Clausius-Clapeyron relation is still valid. During this time heterogeneous evaporation occurs in the substance with bubbles nucleating from impurity sites, surfaces, grain boundaries etc. On the other hand, if the heating process is fast enough that the substance cannot reach binodal curve through heterogeneous boiling, the liquid becomes superheated with its temperature above boiling point at a given pressure. System then shifts away from the binodal and continues to follow the red curve and thus approaches towards spinodal. Near the critical temperature thermodynamic properties like specific heat, density varies rapidly as shown on the figure at right. Density and entropy undergoes largest fluctuation. During this time {{it is possible to}} have a large density fluctuation in a very small volume. This fluctuation of density results in the nucleation of a bubble. The bubble nucleation process occurs homogeneously everywhere in the substance. The rate of bubble nucleation and vapor sphere growth rate increases exponentially closer to the critical temperature. The increasing nucleation prevents the system from going to the spinodal.
