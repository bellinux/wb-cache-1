40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the ecology of}} zooplankton, midwater fishes and top predators off {{the east coast of}} Tasmania in relation to the regional oceanography. This work was completed from small (< 15 m) to large (60 + m) fishing and fisheries research vessels using nets ranging from fine-meshed plankton nets (100 µm) to large midwater trawls (cod end mesh size 10 mm). Further data was obtained from the Maria Island hydrographic station and the AFZ observer program. The study area was situated in and around the northern edge of the subtropical convergence zone. This zone separates the most southern edge of the East Australia Current from the broader subtropical convergence and subantarctic water to the south. The latitudinal position of this front depends not only on the time of year - in the summer it extends southward and retreats in winter - but also on interannual cycles such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation. On the shelf the distribution and biomass of the major zooplankton species, Nyctiphanes australis, was closely related to fluctuations in these water masses. This species is central to the shelf food web - it is, at times, the main prey for predators ranging in size from larval fishes (eg. those of jack mackerel Trachurus declivis) to large southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii). In autumn, when its biomass is highest, schools of its main fish predator, jack mackerel form on the surface over the shelf where they are fished commercially. The central position of N. australis in the shelf food web was demonstrated in the summer of 1988 / 89 when warm waters from an anti El Nino event flushed the shelf resulting in the disappearance of the krill and the subsequent collapse of the jack mackerel fishery. Over the continental slope a suite of myctophid species dominated the water column. These lanternfish aggregate in dense schools over the slope in spring and summer, migrating to the surface at dusk and descending before dawn to depths between 300 - 500 m. Their horizontal distribution is restricted mainly to a thin band (- 500 m wide) over the 300 m contour. One of these, Lampanyctodes hectoris, was central to the upper slope food web. Examination of the reproductive cycles of L. hectoris and other abundant lanternfish showed multiple spawning over winter. The winter spawning is presumably timed so that juveniles can take advantage of increased prey levels, mainly euphausiids, which are generated by the spring bloom. Growth in L. hectoris, which lives up to 3 years, is fastest at this time. In winter they are scarce over the slope. The reasons for this scarcity are not clear, but it is at least partly due to the massive predation on them. However, lack of feed - copepods are the main prey over winter - may limit the size of aggregations that can be sustained. The concentrations of lanternfishes during spring and summer form the basis of a food chain supporting larger fishes such as <b>blue</b> <b>grenadier</b> (<b>Macruronus</b> <b>novaezelandiae)</b> and jack mackerel, and during summer, other larger lanternfish such as Diaphus danae. Offshore, a more diverse community of midwater fishes was identified, which, although similar among the different water masses, was significantly different in the surface waters of the East Australia Current, the result of a relative increase in species of subtropical origin. Densities were an order of magnitude lower than that found for the slope lanternfish. The diets of lanternfish ff shore were dominated by calanoid copepods, particularly those of the genus Plueromamma. Non-myctophids within the same size range ate a wider range of prey. Some, such as the Stomiatoid genus Chauliodus, were entirely piscivorous on lanternfish. Estimation of the relative biomass of zooplankton and micronekton from the main geographic and oceanographic regions of the area showed that shelf biomass was significantly higher than that offshore. This increased biomass appears to be derived from a mixture of subtropical convergence water washing over the shelf and shelfbreak upwelling. The higher biomass over the shelf was reflected in the daily ration of shelf-caught southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), which fed mainly on jack mackerel and had rations - 3 times that of offshore-caught tuna. I identified 10 trophic categories off eastern Tasmania across the shelf to the open sea. These were-large pelagic omnivores (eg. Thunnus maccoyii), pelagic omnivores (eg. Trachurus declivis), pelagic piscivores (eg. Brama brama), small mesopelagic omnivores (eg. Diaphus danae, Lampanyctus australis and Chauliodus sloanii), neritic planktivores (eg. Lampanyctodes hectoris), bathypelagic omnivores (eg. Hoplostethus atlanticus), squid (eg. Nototodarus gouldii), gelatinous zooplankton (eg. Pyrosoma pyrosoma), oceanic (eg. Pleuromamma spp. and Phronima sedentaria) and shelf (eg. Nyctiphanes australis) zooplankton. A common theme, which has run through many of these studies, was the link between inshore and offshore processes. Although the dominant zooplankton and micronekton species were usually restricted in their distributions (eg. Nyctiphanes australis with the shelf), their main predators moved freely between the inshore and offshore waters. I believe that the movements of these predators are determined largely by prey availability. Thus, prey availability, itself dependent upon seasonal and interannual cycles in the regional oceanography, appears to drive much of the seasonal and interannual patterns of abundance of larger fishes in the region. Two of these species, jack mackerel and southern bluefin tuna, are the focus of commercial fisheries. Their effective management therefore will need to consider (1) the dependence of the tuna on the mackerel and (2) that both species in this area depend, either directly or indirectly on krill stocks, which in tum depend on the fluctuations of the regional oceanography. Finally, over the period of this study {{there have been a number}} of advances both in techniques and technologies in the study of midwater communities. I have therefore summarised those techniques and approaches to studying the midwater that I think have benefited this area of research. I have also identified some of the difficulties that need addressing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Hoki (<b>Macruronus</b> <b>novaezelandiae)</b> and ling (Genypterus blacodes) are cold-water {{fish caught}} in New Zealand waters. Their skins {{are a major}} {{component}} of the post-processing waste stream. Valuable products could be developed from the skins, as they are primarily composed of collagen, which has many commercial applications. We prepared acid soluble collagens (ASC) from hoki and ling skins, and analyzed their thermal denaturation properties using a Rapid Visco ™ Analyzer. At slower heating rates the denaturation temperature (TD) of hoki and ling collagens decreased. This result is consistent with the model of irreversible rate kinetics for the denaturation of collagen. We determined the effects of solvents that disrupt hydrogen bonding on ASC stability. Increasing concentrations of urea from 0. 1 M to 1. 0 M and acetic acid from 0. 1 M to 0. 5 M decreased TD. This resulted from the effects of these reagents on the hydrogen bonds that stabilize the collagen triple helix...|$|R

Satellite tracking showed that, on average, birds spent 1 / 3 rd of each foraging trip near vessels, but they foraged over much wider areas than those occupied by the fishing fleets.

40|$|The pelagic {{ecosystem}} on the Chatham Rise east of New Zealand {{has been}} monitored annually using acoustic surveys since 2001.

Mesopelagic schools and layers typically occur at 100 – 400 m depth {{during the day and}} migrate above 200 m depth at night. Previous acoustic estimates of the biomass of mesopelagic fish on the Chatham Rise were based only on night-time estimates from the upper 200 m and may significantly underestimate actual biomass.

In contrast, there is a positive bias associated with acoustic estimates of mesopelagic organisms during the day because they can occur close to the bottom mixed with demersal fish. Two alternative approaches for estimating biomass of diurnally migrating mesopelagic species are suggested.

Length-frequency data (LFD) were obtained from an acoustic survey carried out in November 1999, which covered from 35 ºS to 47 ºS.

The average length of the identified groups were sorted from south to north, and linked to compute significant increment in fish length and age per kilometers. The length increment per time was not due to growth, rather they was due to spatial displacement of juvenile from southern nursery grounds to northern feeding areas. Although homing to feeding areas and/or high residency (partial migration) have been postulated, it seems that recruitment of juveniles to northern feeding areas are origintaed from NPIS nurseries.

[...] 57 pages, 12 colour plates[EN] This is {{a worldwide}} {{catalogue of the}} family Merlucciidae. Two subfamilies, Macruroninae and Merlucciinae, are recognized comprising four genera, Lyconodes, Lyconus, Macruronus and Merluccius, and 18 species. The following subspecies are proposed: <b>Macruronus</b> <b>novaezelandiae</b> magellanicus Lönnberg, 1907; Merluccius albidus magnoculus Ginsburg, 1954, Merluccius australis polylepis Ginsburg, 1954 and Merluccius polli cadenati Doutre, 1960 and Merluccius merluccius smiridus Rafinesque, 1810. The possibility of one other subspecies, Merluccius merluccius lessepsianus, represents the first record of Merluccius from the Red Sea. Merluccius paradoxus is first recorded from Madagascar. In the introductory chapters, Merlucciidae systematics is debated, justifications for the proposed taxonomic organization are provided, and the characters used for the identifications are discussed. Dichotomous keys are provided in the systematics chapter, enabling {{the identification of the}} hakes to the species level. Subfamilies and genera are also defined. The species are arranged in alphabetical order under each subfamily and genus to which they belong. The scientific name appears in bold at the head of each genus and species description, followed by the author, year of first description, and publication. Existing synonyms and FAO common names in English, French and Spanish are also provided. For each species there is an illustration followed by ten sections: description or diagnosis with differential characters; additional information; geographical distribution; habitat and biology; size; fisheries; fishery statistics; state of resources; local names, if any; and bibliographical references (author and year). The review is completed by a series of colour plates showing details of different elements (heads, otoliths, hyomandibulars, urohyals) for a quick and efficient diagnosis of the genera and species of Lyconus, Macruronus and MerlucciusFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The diet of jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) off southern-central Chile is {{described}} to examine potential biases in {{the determination of}} their main prey. Specimens were collected from catches using different fishing gear (jigging, trawl and purse-seine), from July 2003 to January 2004, and from December 2005 to October 2006. The stomach contents were analyzed in terms of frequency of occurrence, number, and weight of prey items and the diet composition was analyzed using Detrended Correspon-dence Analysis. In the industrial purse-seine fleet for jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi), the dominant prey of D. gigas was T. murphyi. In the industrial mid-trawl fishery for Patagonian <b>grenadier</b> (<b>Macruronus</b> magellanicus), the dominant species in the diet of D. gigas was M. magell-anicus. Similarly, Chilean hake (Merluccius gayi) was the main prey in the diet of D. gigas obtained in the industrial trawl fishery for Chilean hake; and, in both artisanal fish-eries (purse-seine for small pelagics and jigging), small pelagic fish and D. gigas were the main prey in the stomach contents of D. gigas. Cannibalism in D. gigas varied between different fleets and probably is related to stress behavior during fishing. The Detrended Correspondence Analysis ordination showed that the main prey in the diet of D. gigas {{is associated with the}} target species of the respective fishery. Consequently, biases are associated with fishing gear, leading to an overestimate in the occurrence of the target species in the diet. We recommend analyzing samples from jigging taken {{at the same time and}} place where the trawl and purse-seine fleets are operating to avoid this problem, and the application of new tools like stable isotope, heavy metal, and fatty acid signature analyses...|$|R
40|$|Peale's dolphin, Lagenorhynchus australis, is {{a common}} but little known species from {{southern}} South America. A {{review of the literature}} produced several observations of feeding behaviour, but only four reports on the examination of stomach contents of this species; all four were from the east coast of the continent in the southern South Atlantic. The seven animals sampled had fed on Argentine shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri), small octopus, three species of squid (Loligo gahi; Illex argentinus), kingklip fish (Genypterus blacodes), Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) and southern cod (Salilota australis). These species are common in the waters of the Patagonian shelf. We report on further observations on dolphin feeding during regular shore-based studies along the central Strait of Magellan and on nine specimens from Tiera del Fuego, seven from the northeastern Atlantic coast and two young animals from the northeastern coast of the Beagle Channel. All nine animals probably died incidentally in shore-based nets set for Patagonian blenny (Eleginops maclovinus). We found at least 15 taxa represented in the stomach contents: eight species of fish, three of cephalopods, one bivalve mollusc, two crustaceans and one species of salp. The salps had been taken by the youngest dolphins, which also had milk in their stomachs. The most important prey species were bottom fish: hagfish (Myxine australis), southern cod (Salilota australis) and Patagonian <b>grenadier</b> (<b>Macruronus</b> magellanicus), followed by the red octopus (Enteroctopus megalocyathus) and Patagonian squid (L. gahi). The remaining species, among others Sprattus fuegensis and Illex argentinus, were marginal or perhaps items ingested by the other actual prey species. The feeding ecology of Peale's dolphin off northeastern Tierra del Fuego seems to be associated with demersal and bottom species captured in or near kelp beds...|$|R

North American Association of Fisheries Economists (NAAFE), Corvallis, 2017. While rights-based management is generally purported enhance economic efficiency in fisheries and reduce over-capitalization, {{the social and}} economic outcomes due to this regulatory regime are less comprehensively understood. Relatively recently, industrialized and export-oriented Latin American fisheries began adopting individual transferable quota (ITQ) regimes to recover collapsed fish stocks. While these programs tend to follow standard, Western approaches to ITQ design and implementation, Argentina experimented with a new design model by interjecting social and ecological objectives into ITQ design through the creation of Artisanal and Social Quota reserves and through determining initial allocation based on historical vessel landings, employment, at-sea and on-land production, investment, historical landings across species, and record of fishery violations. In 2010, Argentina established ITQs for four commercially important and export-oriented fisheries: Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), Patagonian <b>grenadier</b> (<b>Macruronus</b> magellanicus), Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), and southern blue whiting (Micromesistius australis). The first part of this study, to be presented, is a comprehensive institutional analysis of the ITQ fishery management program in Argentina to preliminarily evaluate how configurations of rights-based managed influence social, economic, and ecological outcomes in regulated fisheries. This paper analyzes legislative documents and government data on program design, vessel landings, and participation in the ITQ program from 2000 - 2016, to evaluate how program design, specifically initial allocation and trading restrictions, potentially influences fishery outcomes. The results of this study are broadly applicable to understanding how the design of rights-based management regimes influence compliance behavior, social equity, and economic efficiency outcomes in developing country fisheries...|$|R
