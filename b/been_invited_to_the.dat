Although in past years the MAC champion had <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Motor City Bowl, Buffalo preferred to go to the International Bowl due to Toronto being closer to the school than Detroit, the home of the Motor City Bowl. The game marked the first bowl for the Bulls after their first MAC Championship since moving to Division I-A and joining the MAC in 1999.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, Tanya and Max {{decide to}} remarry. Tanya wants Rainie {{to attend the}} wedding but doesn't {{know where she is}} and asks Cora to track her down. With help from Jack, Cora manages {{to get in touch with}} Rainie and {{arranges}} to meet her at a pub, but upon arriving, Rainie has sent her sponsor Olivia (Samantha Best), to the pub with a letter. Olivia explains that Rainie has been sober for 41 days and has a boyfriend. Rainie is pleased to have <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wedding but declines to attend, stating that Cora is the reason for her alcohol and drug addictions, requesting that she will leave her alone from now on.|$|E
5|$|The two princes {{had been}} in dispute over who should marry Irene Dushmani, the only {{daughter}} of Lekë Dushmani, prince of Zadrima. In 1445, the Albanian princes had <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wedding of Skanderbeg's younger sister, Mamica, who was being married to Muzaka Thopia. Irene entered the wedding and hostilities began. Dukagjini asked Irene to marry him, but Zaharia, who was drunk, saw this, and assaulted Dukagjini. Some princes attempted to stop the fight, but only more people became involved. Several people died or got injured before peace was established. Neither of the two antagonists had suffered any physical damage, but after the event Dukagjini was morally humiliated.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 9November, about 150 councillors {{gathered}} for a two-day meeting in Stuttgart. A majority of the councillors entrusted {{the leaders of the}} SPD and USPD political parties, who had <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> meeting, with the establishment of a provisional government in Württemberg. The Spartacist Albert Schreiner, then chairman of a soldier council, initially assumed the key position of Minister of War in this quickly established first government, which for the time being shared power with the councils. However, he resigned already a few days later, after disputes about the future course of the government. While the Spartacists considered as their ideal aim the kinds of results achieved by the previous year's October Revolution in Russia, the position of the other USPD politicians was unclear and the SPD leaders supported a parliamentary democracy and early elections in Württemberg.|$|E
5|$|Baker {{separated}} from her second husband, Jack Garfein, in 1967, and moved to Europe with her two children {{to pursue a career}} there after struggling to find work in Hollywood. Eventually settling in Rome, Italy, Baker became fluent in Italian and spent the next several years starring in hard-edged Italian thrillers, exploitation, and horror films. In 1966, Baker had <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Venice International Film Festival, where she met director Marco Ferreri, who asked her to play the lead role in Her Harem (1967). This was followed with the horror films The Sweet Body of Deborah (1968) and The Devil Has Seven Faces (1971). Baker also starred in So Sweet... So Perverse (1969), Paranoia (1969), A Quiet Place to Kill (1970), and Il coltello di ghiaccio (Knife of Ice) (1972), all horror films directed by Italian filmmaker Umberto Lenzi.|$|E
5|$|Improving upon 14 {{victories}} in the 2010 season, Vacansoleil-DCM managed 22 victories during the season. Having previously <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2009 Vuelta a España, Vacansoleil-DCM contested the other Grand Tour events – the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France – for the first time. Despite rumours that the team faced exclusion to the doping scandals involving team members Riccardo Riccò and Ezequiel Mosquera, they were included pursuant to UCI rules. The team rarely featured in the Giro, while the team was more successful at the Tour de France. Johnny Hoogerland held {{the lead of the}} mountains classification on two occasions, while Romain Feillu finished in the top five on four stages {{during the first half of}} the race. Hoogerland also made headlines when he and 's Juan Antonio Flecha were sideswiped by a car while they rode in a breakaway. Outside of the Grand Tours, Thomas De Gendt took World Tour stage victories at Paris–Nice and the Tour de Suisse, with Borut Božič also taking a stage win in Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|On 6 September 2007, eight {{members of}} the team (including five runners dressed as bodyguards) and three hired chauffeurs manned a fake Canadian {{motorcade}} consisting of two motorcycles, two black four-wheel drive vehicles, and a black sedan. The group—including Chas Licciardello dressed as Osama bin Laden, and Julian Morrow—drove the motorcade through the Sydney central business district and breached the APEC security zone. The premise of the stunt was that bin Laden should have <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> summit as a world leader, to discuss the War on Terror, with another motive being to test the event's security. The stunt was approved by ABC lawyers under the assumption that the motorcade would be stopped at the first security checkpoint and denied entry.|$|E
5|$|With Đính and the Ngô family's {{increasing}} {{focus on}} the political usage of the army, the military situation in the III Corps deteriorated badly {{in the second half}} of 1963, as personnel were redeployed into the cities. In August, he moved a unit away from Bến Tượng, which had been portrayed as a model settlement in the Strategic Hamlet Program that was supposed to isolate peasants into fortified villages to keep the Viet Cong out. While the unit was in Saigon cracking down on the Buddhists, the communists overran Bến Tượng. A year earlier, the American media contingent had <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opening ceremony of the settlement, which was supposed to be the flagship of the hamlet program. As Đính spent most of October in the capital plotting instead of inspecting the countryside, the communists began to systematically dismantle the strategic hamlets.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the towns}} of Szepes {{developed}} from German colonization of existing Slovak settlements. The German settlers had <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> territory from the mid-12th century onwards. The major immigration came following the devastating Mongol invasion of 1242, which turned Szepes, like {{other parts of the}} Kingdom of Hungary, into a largely depopulated area (some 50% of the population was lost). There was no significant Slavic population remaining and as it was a part of Hungary, King Béla IV of Hungary invited Germans to colonize the Szepes and other regions (covering parts of present-day Slovakia, present-day Hungary and Transylvania). The settlers were mostly traders and miners. The settlements founded by them in the southern parts (Szepesség) were mainly mining settlements (later towns). Consequently, until World War II, Spiš had a large German population (see Carpathian Germans). The last wave of Germans arrived in the 15th century.|$|E
25|$|From {{an early}} age, Clara's career and life was planned {{down to the}} {{smallest}} detail by her father. She daily received a one-hour lesson (in piano, violin, singing, theory, harmony, composition, and counterpoint) and two hours of practice, using the teaching methods he had developed on his own. In March 1828, {{at the age of}} eight, the young Clara Wieck performed at the Leipzig home of Dr. Ernst Carus, director of the mental hospital at Colditz Castle. There she met another gifted young pianist who had <b>been</b> <b>invited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> musical evening, named Robert Schumann, who was nine years older. Schumann admired Clara's playing so much that he asked permission from his mother to discontinue his law studies, which had never interested him much, and take music lessons with Clara's father. While taking lessons, he took rooms in the Wieck household, staying about a year. He would sometimes dress up as a ghost and scare Clara, and this created a bond.|$|E
