5|$|TCDD and dioxin-like {{compounds}} act via {{a specific}} receptor {{present in all}} cells: the aryl hydrocarbon (AH) receptor. This receptor is a transcription factor which is involved in expression of genes; in fact {{it has been shown}} that high doses of TCDD either increase or decrease the expression of several hundred genes in rats. Genes of enzymes activating the breakdown of foreign and often toxic compounds are classic examples of such genes. TCDD increases the enzymes breaking down, e.g., carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons such as <b>benzo(a)pyrene.</b>|$|E
5|$|TCDD may in some {{conditions}} potentiate the carcinogenic {{effects of}} other compounds. An example is <b>benzo(a)pyrene</b> that is metabolized in two steps, oxidation and conjugation. Oxidation produces epoxide carcinogens that are rapidly detoxified by conjugation, but some molecules may {{escape to the}} nucleus of the cell and bind to DNA causing a mutation, resulting in cancer initiation. When TCDD increases the activity of oxidative enzymes more than conjugation enzymes, the epoxide intermediates may increase, increasing the possibility of cancer initiation. Thus a beneficial activation of detoxifying enzymes may lead to deleterious side effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} of mammalian species to detoxify the carcinogenic chemical <b>benzo(a)pyrene</b> to a water-soluble form also correlates well with maximum life span.|$|E
25|$|Other organic {{pollutants}} present in groundwater and derived from industrial operations are the {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs). Due to its molecular weight, Naphthalene is the most soluble and mobile PAH found in groundwater, whereas <b>benzo(a)pyrene</b> is the most toxic one. PAHs are generally produced as byproducts by incomplete combustion of organic matter.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014 {{results of}} a study {{published}} in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that official reports on emissions were not high enough. Report authors noted that, [...] "emissions of organic substances with potential toxicity to humans and the environment are a major concern surrounding the rapid industrial development in the Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR)." [...] This study found that tailings ponds were an indirect pathway transporting uncontrolled releases of evaporative emissions of three representative polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)s (phenanthrene, pyrene, and <b>benzo(a)pyrene)</b> and that these emissions had been previously unreported.|$|E
2500|$|Genotoxic {{carcinogens}} interact {{directly with}} DNA and genetic material or indirectly by their reactive metabolites. Toxicants such as PAHs can be genotoxic carcinogens to aquatic organisms. [...] PAHs are widely {{spread throughout the}} environment through the incomplete burning of coal, wood, or petroleum products. Although PAHs do not bioaccumulate in vertebrate tissue, many studies have confirmed that certain PAH compounds such as <b>benzo(a)pyrene,</b> benz(a)anthracene, and Benzofluoranthene, are bioavailable and responsible for liver diseases like cancer in wild fish populations. One mechanism of action for genotoxic carcinogens includes the formation of DNA adducts. Once the PAH compound enters an organism, it becomes metabolized and available for biotransformation.|$|E

5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} connection between PAH’s, combustion, and cancer was established by Cook and co-workers with {{the isolation of the}} carcinogen <b>benzoapyrene</b> from coal tar extract. <b>Benzoapyrene</b> now has been well characterized in toxicology reports and is a known potent carcinogen. <b>Benzoapyrene</b> requires metabolic activation to become, ultimately, BPDE ( [...] (±)-anti-7β,8α-dihydroxy-9α,10α-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzoapyrene [...] ) which binds to the DNA to form a covalent trans adducts at the N2 position of guanine. Hereafter binding to DNA at cancer hotspots, especially in the P53 tumour suppressor gene at codons: 157, 248 and 273 (figure 3), it has the possibility of inducing lung cancer. Structural similarity of PAHs contributes to the similarity in metabolism, biotransformation and toxicology. <b>Benzoapyrene</b> has been extensively reviewed and is used {{as a model for the}} toxicology and metabolism of other PAHs.|$|E

50|$|However, an in vivo {{experiment}} with gene-deficient mice {{has found that}} the hydroxylation of <b>benzo(a)pyrene</b> by CYP1A1 can have an overall protective effect on the DNA, rather than contributing to potentially carcinogenic DNA modifications. This effect is likely {{due to the fact that}} CYP1A1 is highly active in the intestinal mucosa, and thus inhibits infiltration of ingested <b>benzo(a)pyrene</b> carcinogen into the systemic circulation.|$|E
50|$|There are {{indications}} that <b>benzoapyrene</b> diol epoxide specifically targets the protective p53 gene. This gene is a transcription factor that regulates the cell cycle and hence functions as a tumor suppressor. By inducing G (guanine) to T (thymidine) transversions in transversion hotspots within p53, there is a probability that <b>benzoapyrene</b> diol epoxide inactivates the tumor suppression ability in certain cells, leading to cancer.|$|E

50|$|CYP1A1 is {{also known}} as AHH (aryl {{hydrocarbon}} hydroxylase). It is involved in the metabolic activation of aromatic hydrocarbons (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAH), for example, <b>benzo(a)pyrene</b> (BP), by transforming it to an epoxide. In this reaction, the oxidation of <b>benzoapyrene</b> is catalysed by CYP1A1 to form BP-7,8-epoxide, which can be further oxidized by epoxide hydrolase (EH) to form BP-7,8-dihydrodiol. Finally CYP1A1 catalyses this intermediate to form BP-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide, which is the ultimate carcinogen.|$|E
50|$|The {{detoxification}} enzymes cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) {{are both}} protective and necessary for <b>benzoapyrene</b> toxicity. Experiments with strains of mice engineered to remove (knockout) CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 reveal that CYP1A1 primarily acts to protect mammals from low doses of BaP, and that removing this protection accumulates large concentrations of BaP. Unless CYP1B1 is also knocked out, toxicity {{results from the}} bioactivation of BaP to <b>benzoapyrene</b> -7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide, the ultimate toxic compound,.|$|E
50|$|PAHs - The EPA has {{classified}} seven PAH compounds as probable human carcinogens: benzaanthracene, <b>benzoapyrene,</b> benzobfluoranthene, benzokfluoranthene, chrysene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene.|$|E
50|$|Induction of CYP1A1 by <b>benzoapyrene</b> occurs via binding to the aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor in the cytosol, leading the transformed receptor to translocate to the nucleus where it dimerises with {{aryl hydrocarbon}} receptor nuclear translocator and then binds xenobiotic response elements in DNA located upstream of certain genes. This process increases transcription of genes including CYP1A1, resulting in increased CYP1A1 protein production. This process is similar to induction of CYP1A1 by certain polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins. Seemingly, CYP1A1 activity in the intestinal mucosa prevents major amounts of ingested <b>benzoapyrene</b> to enter portal blood and systemic circulation. Intestinal, but not hepatic, expression of CYP1A1 depends on TOLL-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which is a eucaryotic receptor for bacterial surface structures such as lipoteichoic acid. Moreover, <b>benzoapyrene</b> {{has been found to}} activate a transposon, LINE1, in humans.|$|E
5000|$|The {{capacity}} of mammalian species to detoxify the carcinogenic chemical <b>benzo(a)pyrene</b> to a water-soluble form also correlates well with maximum life span.|$|E

[...] The National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine in Taiwan conducted experiments on the effects of the grapefruit flavanones naringin and naringenin on CYP450 enzyme expression. Naringenin proved to be a potent inhibitor of the <b>benzo(a)pyrene</b> metabolizing enzyme <b>benzo(a)pyrene</b> hydroxylase (AHH) in experiments in mice.|$|E
