These studies were performed in part to unravel details of the previously observed isolated rupture of dye-labeled PC vesicles on glass (Johnson, J. M.; Ha, T.; Chu, S.; <b>Boxer,</b> <b>S.</b> G. Biophys. J. 2002, 83, 3371 - 3379), specifically to differentiate partial rupture, that is, pore formation and leakage of entrapped dye, from full rupture to form bilayer disks. In addition, the adhesion potential of PC vesicles on glass was calculated based upon the adhesion-driven flattening of adsorbed vesicles and a newly developed theoretical model. The vesicles were found to flatten considerably upon adsorption to glass (width-to-height ratio of approximately 5), which leads to an estimate for the adhesion potential and for the critical rupture radius of 1. 5 × 10 - 4 J/m 2 and 250 nm, respectively. Independent of vesicle size and loading with dye molecules, the adsorption of intact vesicles was observed at all concentrations below a threshold concentration, above which the formation of smooth lipid bilayers occurred. In conjunction with previous work (Johnson, J. M.; Ha, T.; Chu, S.; <b>Boxer,</b> <b>S.</b> G. Biophys.

40|$|The {{absorption}} and Stark effect {{spectra of}} the 1250 nm hand {{associated with the}} oxidized special pair (P+) in Rhodobacter sphaeroides reaction centers have been measured. The absorption spectrum in the 1000 - 1450 nm region is essentially identical whether P+ is generated by chemical oxidation or continuous illumination. The Stark effect on the 1250 nm band of P+ is relatively small compared to the Stark effect seen for the Qv transition of P. A quantitative analysis indicates that the change in dipole moment for the 1250 nm band is very small. These results are compared with data for two model systems: a lanthanide-bridged porphyrin dimer, Eu(OEP) 2, and a mixed valence coordination complex, the Creutz-Taube ion.

Here we report that the fluorescence anisotropy of YFP 10 C depends on protein concentration in the low micromolar range that was not expected. We propose that the negative anisotropy is a result of unidirectional Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in a dimer of YFP, with the donor chromophore in the neutral form and the acceptor chromophore in the anionic form. This unusual mechanism is supported by studies of a monomeric YFP (A 206 K YFP) and transient-absorption spectroscopy of YFP 10 C.

At temperatures greater than 160 K, evidence is presented for an electric-field-induced activated recombination pathway similar to that observed in reaction centers which have nonnative quinones of low reduction potential substituted for ubiquinone. However, it is shown that this pathway alone cannot account for the electric-field-induced changes in kinetics observed at higher temperatures. The data analysis used to obtain the log(ket) vs AGet curve at 80 K is extended to include changes in the steady-state population of P+QA- observed at higher temperatures with a continuous wave probe beam. This field dependence is analyzed in terms of electron-transfer theory including the entropy of reaction and the temperature dependences of the reorganization energy and the local field correction.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present an}} {{electric}} field modulated absorption spectroscopy (Stark effect) study of isolated photosystem II reaction center complexes, including a preparation {{in which the}} inactive pheophytin HB was exchanged for 131 -deoxo- 131 -hydroxy-pheophytin. The results reveal that the Stark spectrum of the Qx and Qy transitions of the pheophytins has a second-derivative line shape, indicating that the Stark effect is dominated by differences in the dipole moment between {{the ground and the}} electronically excited states of these transitions (¢í). The ¢í values for the Qx and Qy transitions of HB are small (¢í) 0. 6 - 1. 0 D f- 1), whereas that of the Qx transition of the active pheophytin HA is remarkably large (¢í) 3 D f- 1). The Stark spectrum of the red-most absorbing pigments also shows a second-derivative line shape, but this spectrum is considerably red-shifted as compared to the second derivative of the absorption spectrum. This situation is unusual but has been observed before in heterodimer special pair mutants of purple bacterial reaction centers [Moore, L. J., Zhou, H., and <b>Boxer,</b> <b>S.</b> G.

Despite the predominance of rats in neuroscience research, their vision is not thoroughly studied due {{to the complexity of}} psychophysical measurement and a generally held notion that rat vision is poor. We therefore designed an economical and rapid method to assess the hooded rat’s CSF, using a computer monitor to display stimuli and an infrared touch screen to record responses. A six-alternative forced-choice task presented trials in which a sine-wave grating (S), varying in spatial frequency and contrast, was displayed at different locations along with five gray stimuli (<b>S).</b> <b>Nose</b> pokes to the S but not the S produced water reinforcers. Contrasts were tested at each spatial frequency with a simple adaptive procedure until stimulus detection fell below chance. Psychometric functions were obtained by maximum-likelihood fitting of a logistic function to the raw data, obtaining the threshold as the function’s point of inflection. As in previous studies with rats, CSFs showed an inverse-U shape with peak sensitivity at 0. 12 cyc:deg and acuity just under 1 cyc:deg.

40|$|Vibrational Stark effects, {{which are}} the effects of {{electric}} fields on vibrational spectra, were measured previously for the C-N stretch mode of several small nitriles, yielding difference dipole moments, difference polarizabilities, and transition polarizabilities for each species [Andrews, <b>S.</b> S.; <b>Boxer,</b> <b>S.</b> G. J. Phys. Chem. A 2000, 104, 11 853]. This paper explains the physical origins of the observed Stark effects using two theoretical models and, in the process, computes several molecular parameters for each nitrile. A model with a single vibrational mode, developed with perturbation theory, is found to explain most of the experimental Stark effects. Because it cannot account for coupling between modes, which is ubiquitous and important for resonant vibrations and for combination mode absorption, another model is developed which considers multiple vibrational modes and three spatial degrees of freedom. It is found that difference dipole moments arise {{from a combination of}} mechanical anharmonicity and electronic perturbations of chemical bonds, where the two factors have about equal magnitudes for nitriles. Transition polarizabilities are dominated by the effects of electronic polarizability of the sample molecule, which alters the partial charges on atoms in an electric field. Stark effects of resonant transitions are found to be equal to linear combinations of the effects for the basis states, which explains an experimental observation. For overtone and combination transitions, Stark shifts are predicted to be the sums of the shifts of the component transitions. Absolute overtone intensities can be calculated from difference dipole results, which is experimentally verified. In summary, these theories largely explain the physical origins of observed vibrational Stark effects and can predict Stark effects {{for a wide variety of}} other systems...|$|R

In the DLL mutant the D helix of the M subunit {{has been}} substituted with the D helix from the L subunit, {{and in the}} DLL-FYLFM mutant, three additional mutations are incorporated that facilitate electron transfer to the M side of the RC. In both cases the helix swap {{has been shown to}} yield isolated RCs that are devoid of the native bacteriopheophytin electron carrier HL (Chuang, J. I.; <b>Boxer,</b> <b>S.</b> G.; Holten, D.; Kirmaier, C. Biochemistry 2006, 45, 3845 - 3851). For DLL, depending whether the detergent Deriphat 160 -C or N-lauryl-N,N-dimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO) is used to suspend the RCs, the excited state of the primary electron donor (P*) decays to the ground state with an average lifetime at 77 K of 330 or 170 ps, respectively; however, in both cases the time constant obtained from single-exponential fits varies markedly {{as a function of the}} probe wavelength. These findings on the DLL RC are most easily explained in terms of a heterogeneous population of RCs. Similarly, the complex results for DLL-FYLFM in Deriphat-glycerol glass at 77 K are most simply explained using a model that involves (minimally) two distinct populations of RCs with very different photochemistry. Within this framework, in 50 % of the DLL-FYLFM RCs in Deriphat-glycerol glass at 77 K, P * deactivates to the ground state with a time constant of 400 ps, similar to the deactivation of P * in the DLL mutant at 77 K.

A reference potential that corresponds to the amplified sensor output at the alarm oxygen-partial-pressure level is fed to the second input of the comparator.

When one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>nose</b> is a {{sensitive}} bio-detector of the presence of pollen, one 2 ̆ 7 s brain usually appreciates putting a name to whatever is causing the itchy eyes and runny nose. The job of putting names on the types of pollen in the air has been done by a dedicated team of pollen counters in the Division of Botany, University of Nebraska State Museum. This group, led by Curator Peg Bolick, has been catching, counting, and identifying these allergens since 1990. They do this five days a week from late February through mid-October each year. Problem pollen almost always comes from plants that use wind to transport their pollen to another plant. The chance of an individual grain finding the flower of another plant of the same species is much smaller with wind pollination than it is with animal pollination. Wind-pollinated plants compensate for the lack of precision by producing millions of extra pollen grains, some of which land in noses. Pollen from animal-pollinated plants is sticky, usually forming clumps that are too large to remain in the air very long. However, Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s strong winds occasionally strip these sticky grains from flowers and carry them to noses or pollen samplers. Air-borne pollen has a more restricted size range than that carried by animals. Pollen grains are measured in microns, a unit that is one millionth of a meter. The largest pollen grains, produced by plants that use animals for pollination, are barely visible to the naked eye at about 250 microns (one fourth of a millimeter). The size range for pollen that is transported by wind is an order of magnitude smaller. Unless it has air bladders like pine pollen, grains that are much larger than 100 microns (the size of corn pollen) usually fall out of the air before traveling more than a few meters. At the other end of the scale, a pollen grain smaller than ten microns (the size of ragweed pollen) cannot be caught efficiently by plant stigmas, the part of the flower that leads to the ovule for fertilization...|$|R

40|$|Honey is {{a natural}} {{sweetener}} and its quality labels are associated to its botanical or geographical origin, which is being established by palynological and sensorial analysis. The use of fast and non-invasive techniques such as an electronic nose can become an alternative for honey classification. In this study, the operational parameters of a commercial electronic nose were validated to determine the honey odor profile. A central composite design with five factors, three levels and 28 assays was used, varying sample amounts (1, 2 and 3 g), incubation temperature (30, 40 and 50 °C), incubation time 30 min), gas flow (50, 150 and 250 mL/min) and injection time (100, 200 and 300 <b>s).</b> The commercial <b>nose</b> had ten sensors. Repeatability was evaluated with a coefficient of variation of 10 %. The response surface methodology was used and the optimal operating conditions were: 3 g of sample, incubation at 50 °C for 17 min, gas flow of 100 mL/min and sampling time of 150 s. Finally, these parameters were used to analyze 19 samples of honey, which were classified according to their odor profiles, showing {{that it can be}} a useful tool to classify honey...|$|R
40|$|Superantigens (SAgs) are potent {{microbial}} toxins {{that function}} to activate {{large numbers of}} T cells in a T cell receptor (TCR) Vβ-specific manner, resulting in excessive immune system activation. Staphylococcus aureus possesses a large repertoire of distinct SAgs, and {{in the context of}} host-pathogen interactions, staphylococcal SAg research has focused primarily on the role of these toxins in severe and invasive diseases. However, the contribution of SAgs to colonization by S. aureus remains unclear. We developed a two-week nasal colonization model using SAg-sensitive transgenic mice expressing HLA-DR 4, and evaluated the role of SAgs using two well-studied stains of S. aureus. S. aureus Newman produces relatively low levels of staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), and although we did not detect significant TCR-Vβ specific changes during wild-type S. aureus Newman colonization, S. aureus Newman Δsea established transiently higher bacterial loads in the <b>nose.</b> <b>S.</b> aureus COL produces relatively high levels of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), and colonization with wild-type S. aureus COL resulted in clear Vβ 8 -specific T cell skewing responses. S. aureus COL Δseb established consistently higher bacterial loads in the nose. These data suggest that staphylococcal SAgs may be involved in regulating bacterial densities during nasal colonization...|$|R
40|$|SummaryFood {{handlers}} may {{constitute a}} reservoir of virulent strains of Staphylococcus aureus and may be vehicles of their transmission to food. One hundred and sixty-two volunteers were assessed {{for the presence of}} S. aureus on the hands and in the <b>nose.</b> <b>S.</b> aureus was isolated by routine procedures, and the isolates were tested for susceptibility against a panel of nine antimicrobial agents. The isolates were further characterized by SmaI-PFGE profiling and the presence of virulence factors. ResultsThe prevalence of S. aureus was 19. 8 % in the nose and 11. 1 % on the hands; 6. 2 % of the individuals carried S. aureus both in their noses and hands, and three individuals had the same strain (PFGE type) in the nose and on the hands. Although 82 % of the isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic, none demonstrated the presence of either mecA gene or resistance to oxacillin (none identified as MRSA). Sixty-eight percent of the isolates from the nose and hands possessed enterotoxin genes. This study revealed a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance and virulence determinants among the isolates, including not only classical and novel enterotoxin genes but also major virulence factors such as tst. Potential dissemination of these strains in the community is a matter of concern...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{trend toward}} {{development}} of noninvasive methods that can accurately evaluate the lung periphery has particular relevance for the predominantly parenchymal nature of neonatal respiratory disease. Concerns regarding {{the safety of}} sedating newborn (especially preterm) infants have also stimulated a drive toward measurements obtained during natural sleep. This study aimed to adapt existing methodology for the low-frequency forced oscillation technique to obtain partitioned measurements of airway and parenchymal mechanics during unsedated, quiet sleep in newborn infants without a history of previous respiratory disease. A face mask was positioned over the infant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> mouth and <b>nose</b> and a brief (4 - 5 s) breathing pause was induced by evoking the Hering-Breuer reflex via end-inspiratory occlusion at raised lung volume (airway opening occluded at 2 kPa). Airway opening pressure and flow were measured while a pseudorandom noise (2 - 14 Hz) {{was applied to the}} airway. Acceptable pulmonary impedance data were collected in 11 of the 12 infants studied (34. 1 - 42. 6 wk postmenstrual age, 1. 9 - 3. 9 kg body weight) on 17 (total of 20) occasions. Airway parameters (resistance and inertance) and respiratory tissue parameters were calculated from the resultant impedance spectra. Tissue resistance and tissue elastance decreased with increasing body length albeit at different rates such that hysteresivity (tissue resistance/ tissue elastance) also decreased. There was a trend toward reduction in airway resistance with increasing length. Measurements of lung function are feasible in the unsedated newborn infant using low-frequency forced oscillations and confirm the important contribution of tissue resistance to lung mechanics in the developing lung...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundRecommended disease {{prevention}} behaviors of hand washing, hygienic hand drying, and covering one 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 <b>s</b> mouth and <b>nose</b> in a hygienic manner when coughing and sneezing {{appear to be}} simple behaviors but {{continue to be a}} challenge to successfully promote and sustain worldwide. We conducted a qualitative inquiry to better understand current hand drying behaviors associated with activities of daily living, and mouth and nose covering practices, among Kenyans. Methods and FindingsWe conducted 7 focus group discussions; 30 in-depth interviews; 10 structured household observations; and 75 structured observations in public venues in the urban area of Kisumu; rural communities surrounding Kisumu; and a peri-urban area outside Nairobi, Kenya. Using a grounded theory approach, we transcribed and coded the narrative data followed by thematic analysis of the emergent themes. Hand drying, specifically on a clean towel, was not a common practice among our participants. Most women dried their hands on their waist cloth, called a leso, or their clothes whether they were cooking, eating or cleaning the nose of a young child. If men dried their hands, they used their trousers or a handkerchief. Children rarely dried their hands; they usually just wiped them on their clothes, shook them, or left them wet as they continued with their activities. Many people sneezed into their hands and wiped them on their clothes. Men and women used a handkerchief fairly often when they had a runny nose, cold, or the flu. Most people coughed into the air or their hand. ConclusionsDrying hands on dirty clothes, rags and lesos can compromise the benefits of handwashing. Coughing and sneezing in to an open hand can contribute to spread of disease as well. Understanding these practices can inform health promotion activities and campaigns for the prevention and control of diarrheal disease and influenza...|$|R
40|$|Heterobasidion annosum, the causative {{agent of}} the disease “root and butt rot” in conifers, is {{ubiquitous}} in the environment and causes severe financial losses to the forestry industry throughout the temperate zone. The normal route of infection is as basidiospores that land on the freshly cut stump surface during thinning operations, the colonisation of the stump providing sufficient inoculum for the fungal hyphae to invade healthy roots of adjoining trees. The most successful disease control measures involve depriving the pathogen {{the opportunity to become}} established in the food source of the fresh cut stump. Frequently killing the surface of the stump with a chemical treatment does this, but there is also some success with a biocontrol method. When the antagonist Phlebiopsis gigantea, a saprophyte, is inoculated onto the stump surface it rapidly invades the tissue thus preventing the pathogen access to the resource. Environmental studies have been carried out to assess the fitness of different isolates of the antagonist relative to the pathogen. Competitiveness was affected by environmental factors; water availability, osmotic/matric potentials, temperature, nutrition, and substrate. These indicate that the antagonist is not able to suppress the pathogen under all conditions. Generally, in wet warm conditions the antagonist is dominant, ID 10 : 2 antagonist:pathogen, but in drier, cooler conditions the pathogen is dominant, ID 2 : 10 on MEA. Interactions in situ on wood discs showed the pathogen was restricted to 0 - 2 % of the treated portion and 2 - 10 % of the un-treated surface at 25 ºC, but at 4 ºC it colonised 2 - 24 % of the former and 34 - 57 % the latter. Consideration needs to be given to possible field conditions at the time of application to maximise the establishment of the antagonist. Studies have been carried out to examine potential for liquid or solid substrate fermentation systems for optimising production of P. gigantea. Liquid culture studies were variable regardless of available nutrients and ecophysiological stresses imposed, producing a maximum of 6. 5 log 10 CFU ml - 1. However, temporal studies on solid substrate based on Pinus sylvestris sawdust gave 8 Log 10 viable oidia g - 1 in the best moisture content treatments. Scale up, to 200 g substrate produced similar CFUs, however increasing to 400 g showed a reduction in viable oidia, due to lack of moisture equiibration. Analyses of the endogenous reserves to identify specific quality characteristics were inconclusive. Mycelial pellets and submerged conidia produced in fermentation had increased levels of glycerol and erythritol as aw was lowered, however this was not replicated by oidia produced in solid substrate fermentation. Preservation studies, in a fluidised bed reactor showed, the survival of PG 21 spores at up to 60 ºC for 20 min. Studies were carried out to analyse volatile fingerprints of antagonist and pathogen isolates using an AlphaM. O. <b>S.</b> electronic <b>nose.</b> Volatile fingerprints showed clear grouping of antagonist and pathogen isolates, as distinct from each other. With some isolates, the fingerprints of interactions were co-incidental with the antagonist. It is suggested that this novel technique {{could be used as a}} rapid screening method for potential BCAs. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
