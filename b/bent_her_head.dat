60|$|Brooks made no reply. The girl {{suddenly}} <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> towards him.|$|E
60|$|Nelly <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> silently, but Alice {{held out}} her hand frankly.|$|E
60|$|She muttered {{some strange}} words and <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> lower over the girl's hand.|$|E
60|$|Instead of answering, Emily <b>bent</b> down <b>her</b> <b>head</b> between <b>her</b> hands, {{and burst}} {{suddenly}} into tears.|$|R
60|$|Miss Dartle softly touched <b>her,</b> and <b>bent</b> down <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to whisper, but {{she would}} not hear a word.|$|R
6000|$|As {{he spoke}} the leaves that hid Violet's golden heart opened wide {{and let him}} see how glad she was, as she <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> stately <b>head</b> and {{answered}} softly,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Mary <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{a little}} lower, and heavy tears rolled down her cheeks.|$|E
60|$|She <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{and turned}} her ear towards the ground as though to hearken.|$|E
60|$|And as she spake, she <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> before him, {{as already}} {{yielding}} {{it to the}} executioner.|$|E
60|$|Dolly <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> pretty <b>head</b> in {{reluctant}} assent, with {{a torrent}} of inner joy. The sun flashed in her chestnut hair. The triumph of that moment was to her inexpressible.|$|R
6000|$|... "O mother!" [...] Elizabeth-Jane <b>bent</b> down <b>her</b> <b>head</b> so {{much that}} she looked quite into her own lap. But as her mother did not go on, she said, [...] "What reason?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{threw her}} arms round his neck, and <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> fair <b>head</b> over his, while sailors, 'prentices, and coarse harbor-women were hushed into holy silence, and made a ring round {{the mother and the}} son.|$|R
60|$|She <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> courteously, {{drew closer}} {{the folds of}} her shawl, and passed from the classe.|$|E
60|$|She <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{but did not}} speak, and I {{saw that}} there was fear in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|She <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> put {{her fingers}} between her lips, while the {{bitterness}} surged {{up in her}} heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't talk such nonsense, child, but go on {{with what}} you were {{speaking}} about," [...] rejoined Susan, with a smile, to conceal which she <b>bent</b> down <b>her</b> <b>head</b> as she plied her needle briskly on one of Emma's mountain-torn dresses.|$|R
60|$|Having {{become a}} few degrees calmer, {{he looked up at}} her now, his eyes wide and vivid with a {{declaration}} that made her shrink back as if flame had leaped towards <b>her</b> face. She <b>bent</b> down <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and picked at her dress.|$|R
60|$|The {{little girl}} {{did not mind}} being alone, for {{she was working on}} her first piece of embroidery--a sofa pillow for papa's {{birthday}} present. So she crept into the big bay window and curled herself up on the broad sill while she <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> brown <b>head</b> over <b>her</b> work.|$|R
60|$|Kirsteen <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> If {{there was}} {{irony in the}} gesture, it was not {{perceived}} by Frances Freeland.|$|E
60|$|Nanina's hands {{dropped on}} the priest's knees. She <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> down on them, and began to weep bitterly.|$|E
60|$|She <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{gently in}} token that she {{understood}} him. Then she went on, and stood before Geoffrey.|$|E
60|$|Night {{after night}} {{loneliness}} had no fears for her. If {{she heard a}} whistle on the avenue, the honk of a car--the familiar old signals of the boys and girls, she smiled her disdain, and curling comfortably in <b>her</b> great chair, <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> lovely <b>head</b> over <b>her</b> books.|$|R
60|$|She did not reply, only <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> sweet <b>head,</b> lest {{he should}} {{perceive}} the tears which had gathered in her eyes. All round them the wood {{seemed to have}} grown darker and more dense, whilst from afar the weird voice of that distant sea murmured of infinity and of the relentlessness of Fate.|$|R
6000|$|Hardly had she spoken, {{when another}} sharp tap resounded still more clearly along the rail at <b>her</b> feet. She <b>bent</b> down <b>her</b> <b>head</b> once more, and laid her eager ear beside it in terrible suspense. A rough man's voice--a navvy's, no doubt, or a fireman's--came {{speeding}} along the metal; {{and it said}} in thick accents-- ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Parsons <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and {{the silent}} tears rolled down her cheeks. The others {{understood}} only too well.|$|E
60|$|The {{old woman}} <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> over a Sevres china clock, and stroked it tenderly with her feather duster.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} Madame {{with a faint}} derisive smile. Then he turned to Alvina. She <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and blushed.|$|E
60|$|Gerty MacDowell <b>bent</b> down <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and crimsoned at {{the idea}} of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she'd be ashamed of her life to say, {{flushing}} a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Ciss.|$|R
60|$|More than once, or twice, or thrice, in {{the long}} {{thoughtful}} night, they showed her to him sitting on her favourite seat, with <b>her</b> <b>bent</b> <b>head,</b> <b>her</b> hands clasped on her brow, her falling hair. As {{he had seen her}} last. And when they found her thus, they neither turned nor looked upon him, but gathered close round her, and comforted and kissed her, and pressed on one another, to show sympathy and kindness to her, and forgot him altogether.|$|R
60|$|In another moment, however, {{she found}} herself in the state of being {{released}} from him; some one was taking him from her, though he had <b>bent</b> down <b>her</b> <b>head</b> so much, that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away, before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it.|$|R
60|$|She <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and {{was silent}} for some moments. Then she lifted her face {{and looked at him}} oddly.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the first}} time since his return that he had spoken of love. Lucy <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> still lower.|$|E
60|$|Her colour {{came and}} went once more; and once more, as she <b>bent</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> I saw the same sad smile.|$|E
60|$|At {{the words}} Elma {{rose from her}} seat, still paler than ever, but strangely resolute, and took the stick from his hand with a gesture of despair. She was almost stifled. But. she raised it with method. Knocking the rail twice, she <b>bent</b> down <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and listened in turn. Once more two {{answering}} knocks rang sharp along the connecting line of metal. Elma shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> ominously.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ten years,' croaked the unsympathetic Pipchin, with a frosty glistening of {{her hard}} grey eye, and a dreary shaking of <b>her</b> <b>bent</b> <b>head,</b> 'is a long time.' ...|$|R
60|$|Manifestly {{that tone}} irritated Isbel beyond control. He {{misunderstood}} it. With a hand far from gentle he pushed <b>her</b> <b>bent</b> <b>head</b> back {{so he could}} look into her face.|$|R
