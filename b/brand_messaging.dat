40|$|Technological advancements have {{initiated}} {{the development of}} a dispersed media landscape, and expanded possibilities for multichannel brand communication. The shift encourages brands in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry to establish seamless channel integration, and examine interactions in the stakeholder network. Respectively, this research explores how FMCG companies can coordinate <b>brand</b> <b>messages</b> in the dispersed media landscape. The purpose of this thesis is to conceptualize what the underlying elements are regarding <b>brand</b> <b>message</b> coordination by examining the interdependence of the actors in the network. The study contributes to branding literature by supplementing traditional concepts of branding and multichannel management with service-dominant logic. The empirical research was conducted as a qualitative case study of three low-involvement FMCG brands. The conclusions demonstrate that an extensive and hierarchical stakeholder network can restrict <b>brand</b> <b>message</b> coordination. Furthermore, the stakeholder network should consist of dyadic and dynamic interactions. A focal actor in the network orchestrates <b>brand</b> <b>messages</b> and stakeholder interactions, which facilitates consistent brand communication. Additionally, the conclusions indicate that a change of the <b>brand</b> <b>message</b> might result in a positive outcome and control over the messages is improved when the core of the brand is solid...|$|R

And, although emotional cues did not influence re-Tweeting on their own, they reinforced the effects of informational cues and traceability cues (hashtags) when combined in the same message.

30|$|In the {{traditional}} market, firms decided which {{products and services}} {{they were going to}} produce and consumers did not play any role in value creation. In post-modernity, social media is an increasingly influential determiner of brand value (Arvidsson 2005), and companies are no longer sole dictators of <b>brand</b> <b>message.</b> While traditional advertising communicates a <b>brand’s</b> <b>message,</b> current practices of digital marketers strive to create relevant and compelling content, often through value co-creation, defined as “joint creation of value by the company and the customer” (Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004, p. 8). This co-creation is especially paramount in the post-modern consumption era where emotional branding defines brand meaning through consumer-brand interactions (Thompson et al. 2006) and consumers’ word-of-mouth referrals significantly hike new customer purchases on social media platforms (Trusov et al. 2009).|$|R

The study showed that framing of <b>brand</b> <b>messages</b> in native advertising dramatically differs from journalism but is somewhat similar to framing in PR. Branded storytelling uses topics that align with brands' themes to highlight essential attributes and create a positive image of a brand. Native advertisements use critical issues and socially significant causes to demonstrate values and qualities of brands. On the contrary, journalism stories frame brands as examples in a larger picture of a complex social reality...|$|R
