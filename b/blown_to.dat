5|$|About January 1843, on {{the orders}} of the acting Settlement Engineer, Captain D.H. Stevenson, the slab was <b>blown</b> <b>to</b> pieces to clear and widen the {{passageway}} at the Singapore River mouth to make space for Fort Fullerton and the quarters of its commander. Some sources claim that the Superintendent of Public Works, George Drumgoole Coleman, {{was responsible for the}} Stone's destruction, but he was on leave and not in Singapore {{at the time of its}} blasting. Lieutenant-Colonel James Low had petitioned to have the sandstone slab spared, but had been told that it was in the way of a projected bungalow. On the explosion taking place, he crossed the river from his office and selected fragments that had letters on them. As the fragments were very bulky, he had them chiselled into small slabs by a Chinese man. He selected some of the smaller fragments bearing the most legible parts of the inscription and sent them to the Royal Asiatic Society's museum in Calcutta (now known as the Indian Museum) for analysis, where they arrived in about June 1848.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the Duke of Braganza mounted cannons, dug trenches, tended the wounded, ate {{among the}} rank and file and fought under heavy fire as men next to him were shot or <b>blown</b> <b>to</b> pieces. His cause was nearly lost until he took the risky step of {{dividing}} his forces and sending a portion to launch an amphibious attack on southern Portugal. The Algarve region fell to the expedition, which then marched north straight for Lisbon, which capitulated on 24 July. Pedro proceeded to subdue the remainder of the country, but just when the conflict looked to be winding down to a conclusion, his Spanish uncle Don Carlos, who was attempting to seize the crown of his niece Doña IsabelII, intervened. In this wider conflict that engulfed the entire Iberian Peninsula, the First Carlist War, the Duke of Braganza allied with liberal Spanish armies loyal to IsabelII and defeated both MiguelI and Carlos. A peace accord was reached on 26 May 1834.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, {{the party}} comes to {{discover}} that the Crystals formed a seal upon Exdeath, an ancient sorcerer; with them destroyed, not only would the dark essence be released, but over time the planet itself would become uninhabitable. The party attempts to save the crystals of Water, Fire, and Earth; but by the machinations of human folly or the influence of the sealed Exdeath, they fail. Having been freed, Exdeath defeats the party and returns to his homeworld. Galuf's granddaughter Krile arrives by meteorite, restoring Galuf's memory completely; he recalls he originated from the same world as Exdeath, pursuing him back home with Krile. Bartz and the others resolve that the fight is not Galuf's alone, together traveling to the distant planet world, where Exdeath is already wreaking havoc in pursuit of that world's Crystals. The trio is captured, but Galuf rescues them and defeats Exdeath's lieutenant, Gilgamesh, in the process. They are <b>blown</b> <b>to</b> a distant continent when a magical barrier is activated during their escape, but make their way to Bal Castle, Galuf's kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Nelson was {{a highly}} {{experienced}} officer who had been blinded in one eye during fighting in Corsica in 1794 and subsequently commended for his capture of two Spanish ships of {{the line at the}} Battle of Cape St. Vincent in February 1797. In July 1797, he lost an arm at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and had been forced to return to Britain to recuperate. Returning to the fleet at the Tagus in late April 1798, he was ordered to collect the squadron stationed at Gibraltar and sail for the Ligurian Sea. On 21 May, as Nelson's squadron approached Toulon, it was struck by a fierce gale and Nelson's flagship, HMS Vanguard, lost its topmasts and was almost wrecked on the Corsican coast. The remainder of the squadron was scattered. The ships of the line sheltered at San Pietro Island off Sardinia; the frigates were <b>blown</b> <b>to</b> the west and failed to return.|$|E
5|$|On {{the death}} of Alphonso Vincent in 1932, his son George {{inherited}} the property. He lived at the site in an old lorry {{until his death in}} 1973. The mill passed to his daughter, who sold it in 1974 to Mr and Mrs Humphries, who intended to convert it into a house. They later changed their minds and offered it for sale for restoration. In 1976, the cap of the mill was <b>blown</b> <b>to</b> pieces in a gale. Thelnetham windmill was purchased by five members of the Suffolk Mills Group in November 1979, and plans for restoration were made. The consortium consisted of Mark Barnard, Charles Dolman, Peter Dolman, David Pearce and Chris Seago. The derelict mill and an acre of land cost £6,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} investigation {{concluded that}} the flight, regarded as a controlled flight into terrain, was caused by pilot errors {{and that there was}} no fault with the aircraft. Contributing factors causing the accident were lack of a procedure for offset localizer approach for setting approach course on the HSIs. Thus, both HSIs were set incorrectly, which along with the course deviation indicator hinted that the plane was being <b>blown</b> <b>to</b> the left and needed to adjust course to the right. Because he was in a stressed situation, the navigator set the GPS in the wrong mode. He also did not have sufficient time to recheck his work, allowing mistakes to happen, and his work was not monitored by the pilots. As the navigator was overworked, it was inappropriate for the first officer to transfer the responsibility of lateral control to him.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{started at}} 6:15p.m. local {{time as a}} {{waterspout}} over Community Lake, just west of town. It then moved {{through the center of}} town along Christian Street, damaging almost every structure as it went. The tornado tore houses from their foundations, throwing some more than 600 feet (180 meters). A receipt from the town was later found 65 miles (105km) east in Peacedale, Rhode Island. Large trees were uprooted and snapped, and those that were still standing were stripped of small limbs and leaves. The Catholic Church was <b>blown</b> <b>to</b> bits, and heavy tombstones in the nearby cemetery were tossed around. The brand-new brick high school building was almost completely destroyed. The tornado's path through town was only two miles long, but the damage path was up to 600 feet (180 meters) wide.|$|E
5|$|With Sam {{closing in}} on Lilith, Castiel and Zachariah imprison Dean within an idyllic waiting room, where he will be made {{comfortable}} until the time comes for him to play his role in stopping the Apocalypse. Dean refuses to remain idle, and continually requests {{to be able to}} see Sam, which is denied. Once Dean discovers the angels are allowing the Apocalypse to happen, he implores for Castiel to help him stop the final seal from being broken. Though Castiel refuses at first, he returns ready to help not long after. He takes Dean to see the prophet Chuck for information on Sam. Their presence does not fall in line with Chuck's Gospel, so the Archangel Raphael begins to descend. Castiel sends Dean to Sam, remaining behind to hold back the archangel and any others who might come. He is subsequently killed, with his host's body being <b>blown</b> <b>to</b> pieces.|$|E

25|$|Several {{types of}} {{atmospheric}} aerosol {{have a significant}} effect on Earth's climate: volcanic, desert dust, sea-salt, that originating from biogenic sources and human-made. Volcanic aerosol forms in the stratosphere after an eruption as droplets of sulfuric acid that can prevail for up to two years, and reflect sunlight, lowering temperature. Desert dust, mineral particles <b>blown</b> <b>to</b> high altitudes, absorb heat and may be responsible for inhibiting storm cloud formation. Human-made sulfate aerosols, primarily from burning oil and coal, affect the behavior of clouds.|$|E
5000|$|Serious spinal injures {{are usually}} caused by axial forces due <b>to</b> <b>blows</b> on the head, or bending and {{twisting}} {{forces on the}} back caused by <b>blows</b> <b>to</b> the shoulders, hips {{and other parts of}} the body. In the Cambridge Standard for Motorcyclists Clothing, Roderick Woods asserts that the majority of spinal injuries are caused by <b>blows</b> <b>to</b> the hip and shoulders. In the rare circumstance that a motorcyclist received a direct <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the back, the damage would be unmitigable by armor. The concept of a [...] "back protector" [...] is therefore not endorsed by Woods. Although back protectors, as defined in the standard, cannot protect against axial forces they are required to protect the scapula and there is now considerable anecdotal evidence that wearing a certified back protector can significantly reduce trauma in a major accident as they reduce the effect of impacts on the ribs and lessen the <b>blows</b> <b>to</b> internal organs too.|$|R

The Sports Concussion Institute states a concussion “can be caused either by a direct <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the head, or an indirect <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the body, causing neurological impairments that may resolve spontaneously”. The <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the body causes a series of reactions in the brain which cause a variety of symptoms associated with disruption of the brain.|$|R

In a highly secret British project, Graph {{was also used}} {{as a model for}} the construction of three, full-sized, mock-ups of the control compartment, wardroom and radio room of a Type VII U-boat. These were used to train specialist groups of sailors, who would form boarding parties whenever a damaged U-boat was <b>blown</b> <b>to</b> the surface. They were trained to operate a U-boat's ballast-tank valves, to reverse any scuttling attempts by the crew, and to search quickly for cryptographic equipment and documents.|$|E
25|$|After {{successfully}} transporting {{the patient}} from Tingwall Airport in the Shetland Islands to Inverness, the pilot, nurse, and physician were {{returning to their}} home base in Tingwall. There was a strong and gusting right crosswind at the runway. The pilot's approach procedure required him to make right turns to line up with the runway. However, these right turns obscured the pilot's view of the runway, and when the pilot made his final right turn, the aircraft had been <b>blown</b> <b>to</b> {{the left of the}} runway, too far to make a safe landing. The pilot executed a go-around procedure and attempted another approach. Again, the aircraft was blown far {{to the left of the}} runway centreline, and during the final approach turn, the aircraft lost a great deal of altitude, striking the ground 1.5km short of the runway and approximately 0.3km to the left of the runway centreline. The AAIB determined that nighttime visibility of the airport environment was inadequate, especially during right crosswind conditions, and recommended the Tingwall Airport add additional ground lighting to aid pilots' ability to acquire the runway during nighttime approaches.|$|E
