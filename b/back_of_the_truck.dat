5|$|Hartmann patiently {{waited for}} the right moment to escape, then, using the {{distraction}} of the Stukas attack, he attacked the single guard. Hartmann jumped out of the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> and ran into a large field of giant sunflowers. Evading the pursuing soldiers, Hartmann hid and waited for nightfall. In the dark, Hartmann followed a Soviet patrol heading west to the front. As he approached the German position, he was challenged by a sentry who fired a shot which passed through his trousers.|$|E
5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck,</b> and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E
5|$|Although {{suddenly}} {{very wealthy}} and successful, {{many of the}} band and its entourage now struggled with heroin addiction. Four individuals — group leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Red Dog Campbell — checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971. On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, then 24, {{was killed in a}} motorcycle accident one day after returning to Macon. Allman was riding his motorcycle at a high speed at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a flatbed truck carrying a lumber crane approached. The truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to swerve his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision. As he was doing so, he struck either the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle. The motorcycle bounced into the air, landed on Allman and skidded another 90 feet with Allman pinned underneath, crushing his internal organs. Though he was alive {{when he arrived at the}} hospital, despite immediate emergency surgery, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} Arrowhead Water Company {{trucks and}} drivers, 1930 - 1940. Four early-model trucks are visible at center, all facing to <b>the</b> right. <b>The</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trucks</b> have two-tiered wooden beds with water bottles packed in densely. <b>The</b> drivers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trucks</b> can be seen near <b>the</b> front wheels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicles.

5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{attributed}} <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wreck to <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> driver's {{reaction to}} the grade crossing signals. Thinking he could beat the train across the tracks, the driver chose to proceed onto the tracks in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train. The driver reported that the crossing signal did not activate until his vehicle was [...] "right on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track," [...] but he also stated {{that he did not}} want to brake quickly to avoid a shifting load that could hit <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck's</b> cab. Witnesses stated that the gates came down after <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> had entered <b>the</b> grade crossing. One witness stated that the gate clipped <b>the</b> <b>truck's</b> trailer and that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate may have broken off as a result.|$|R
5|$|On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, aged 24, {{was killed}} in a {{motorcycle}} accident a day after returning to the band's home of Macon, Georgia.

The loss devastated all who knew Allman, just as At Fillmore East climbed into the top 15 of the national album charts.|$|E
5|$|Woody {{returns to}} Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy {{that there is}} only one way out of the daycare: the trash. Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz {{promptly}} allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the tag and says that toys are meant to be discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find themselves on a conveyor belt, leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who straps him to his truck's radiator grill, and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.|$|E
25|$|On 12 February, Clancy again led {{a team of}} the Squad, {{this time}} in the {{attempted}} rescue of Robert Barton, who was to stand trial before a military tribunal. They planned to intercept the truck transporting the prisoner to Mountjoy Jail. The rescue went according to plan, but when they went to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck,</b> Barton was not there. Barton had been taken to Marlborough Barracks (now McKee Barracks) instead, and he was sentenced the following week to three years and transferred to a prison in England.|$|E

25|$|Most tankers have an {{on-board}} pumping system. This pump {{is often}} not of sufficient power to fight fires (as {{it is designed to}} be attached to a fire engine), but is more often used to draw water into the tender from hydrants or other water sources. In some areas, the tenders are used to pump water during floods, and may be fitted with a heavier duty pump for this purpose. Many tankers are equipped with fast-drain valves on the sides and <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck.</b> This allows firefighters to empty thousands of gallons of water into a portable water tank in just a few seconds.|$|E
25|$|Peter {{was posted}} to British East Africa (now Kenya) as a {{corporal}} {{in charge of}} a dog unit during the Mau Mau Uprising. On 8 October 1954, while en route to Thompson Falls (now Nyahururu) in a truck with ten men of the King's African Rifles, the vehicle hit a pothole in the road and flipped over. Sitting upfront, both Randall and the driver were covered in fuel and set alight. The soldiers in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> managed to scramble free, but Randall on leaving the cab saw that the driver was unconscious and re-entered the front of the truck to drag him to safety. Once the driver came around, Peter realized that a dog was chained up inside the burning truck. Removing his clothes, he went back into the truck once again and released the animal.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Allen pulling up to a junkyard {{in a white}} pickup truck at night, with a watch hanging from his key chain. [...] Then, Allen takes a power cord out of the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> and carries it through the junkyard until he plugs it in and flips a switch to turn on a large {{countdown}} clock. [...] As the clock reaches zero, Allen leaves and begins {{walking away from the}} camera as the sun rises. [...] Throughout the video, Allen is shown playing both an acoustic guitar and a piano, as well as singing without any instruments.|$|E
50|$|There {{has also}} been {{speculation}} that an unmatched leg found at the bombing site may have belonged to an unidentified, additional bomber. It was claimed that this bomber was either in the building when the bombing occurred, or had previously been murdered, and McVeigh had left his body in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ryder <b>truck</b> to hide it in the explosion.|$|R
5000|$|Johns {{involved}} a United States Customs drug smuggling investigation in Arizona where Customs officers followed two pickup trucks {{to a remote}} desert airstrip, and set up surveillance. Two small airplanes landed and departed. The officers walked up on <b>the</b> <b>trucks</b> and could smell marijuana. In <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trucks</b> were what obviously were bales of marijuana wrapped in dark green plastic bags and sealed with tape. Several men were arrested at the scene. Johns and another were the pilots, and they were arrested when they landed. <b>The</b> <b>trucks</b> were not searched at the scene. Instead, they were removed to a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) warehouse in Tucson. Three days later, the officers took samples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marijuana. The district court ordered suppression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evidence because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unreasonableness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> delay, and the government appealed. <b>The</b> Court <b>of</b> Appeals for <b>the</b> Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that <b>the</b> search <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicles three days later was unreasonable under United States v. Ross (1982).|$|R
5000|$|Woodbury's forces then {{storm the}} prison, using a grenade {{launcher}} {{to blow up}} the guard towers with a shock-and-awe approach, while Shumpert rakes the walkways with a mounted heavy machine gun, and the others fire from <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trucks</b> at both <b>the</b> zombies in the yard and at the prison. They use <b>the</b> <b>trucks</b> to storm <b>the</b> prison yard, mow down the fences, and yank off the grated cell block gates, until the spikes Michonne laid earlier flattens one vehicle's tires. The army then moves on foot into a seemingly abandoned prison, where The Governor leads them into the tombs. The Governor finds a Bible Hershel left for him, opened to the highlighted passage, John 5:29, [...] "And shall come forth: they that have done good, unto <b>the</b> resurrection <b>of</b> life; and they that have done evil, unto <b>the</b> resurrection <b>of</b> damnation."

2500|$|Police {{finally caught}} up to Rifkin on June 28, 1993, when state troopers spotted him driving his pickup truck without license plates on the Southern State Parkway. A {{high-speed}} chase ended in Mineola, New York when he crashed into a utility pole {{directly in front of}} the courthouse where he eventually stood trial. Troopers detected a foul odor from the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck.</b> It came from the corpse of [...] his final victim: sex worker and dancer Tiffany Bresciani, 22, the girlfriend of Dave Rubinstein (a.k.a. Dave Insurgent, a member of the 1980s punk rock band Reagan Youth), Rifkin had picked Bresciani up in his Mazda pick-up truck on June 24, 1993, where she was working on Allen Street in Manhattan, New York City.|$|E
2500|$|After {{their return}} to Australia, the members began rehearsing in February 1975, still using the name of Mississippi. In Wheatley's autobiography, Paper Paradise (1999), he {{described}} how they obtained their name: [...] "It was now {{time to get out}} of the rehearsal room and play to a live audience – somewhere without any fanfare, somewhere out of the way. I booked the Golfview Hotel in Geelong for the Saturday night of 1 March 1975. While travelling to the venue down the Geelong Road from Melbourne, we passed the turn-off for Little River. From the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck,</b> Glenn Shorrock shouted, 'What about the Little River Band'? And so, that night the Golfview Hotel witnessed the first performance of the Little River Band, albeit advertised on the marquee as Mississippi." [...] On 20 March 1975 they played their first official gig under their new name at Martini's Hotel in Carlton. They played a return gig at the Golfview Hotel five days later.|$|E

2500|$|A {{regiment}} is sent against [...] "Chonkin's gang", but Chonkin successfully fends {{them off}} until they use artillery. When general Drynov incredulously learns that Chonkin single-handedly (with his baba) was holding off the whole regiment, he declares Chonkin {{a hero and}} awards him an order taken off his own chest. When the NKVD lieutenant shows the order for Chonkin's arrest, Drynov shrugs and tells them {{to carry out their}} duty at which point Chonkin is arrested and carried off in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> to the [...] "Right Place", leaving Nyura on her knees on the road weeping after Chonkin as the scene closes and the book ends. The book ends with the joke on Gladyshev, whose misunderstanding of evolution (that monkeys became man through labor and intelligence) has been thoroughly dissettled by Chonkin's question why horses do not become men if they work harder than men do, finds a note attached to the bottom of a hoof of his dead horse which had earlier disappeared. Supposing the horse had evolved and written the note, he is spooked and crosses himself.|$|E
2500|$|Jones then unfurled a large, square banner {{with white}} hand-lettering that read: [...] "HMO's {{are in it}} for the money!! Live free, love safe or die." [...] Jones had made the banner {{specifically}} for the occasion and displayed it for the news helicopters to see. As it was pretty windy on the interstate at the time, Jones weighted the banner down with a container to stop it blowing away. Jones continued to make obscene gestures and returned to his truck several times to pet his dog. This was all broadcast on live television by news helicopters recording the event live. As it was a Thursday afternoon, it was witnessed by many children, whose after-school cartoons had been interrupted in order to broadcast the incident. As authorities prepared to negotiate with him, Jones suddenly returned to his truck and sat in the front seat. Intending to take his own life, Jones ignited a Molotov cocktail inside his truck. The vehicle suddenly burst into flames and was set ablaze. Jones got out of the vehicle however and ran across the freeway as he was engulfed in flames and smoke, with his hair, pants and socks all on fire. Jones tried to pat out the flames, managing to peel off his pants, socks and underwear. He continued to wander about, naked from the waist, looking dazed and disoriented. He then walked {{to the edge of the}} freeway gesturing angrily. It appeared as if he was about to jump off the freeway, however, he changed his mind and backed away from the edge, before returning to his ablaze truck. Moments later, at around 3:50p.m., he retrieved his shotgun from the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> and then walked back across the freeway. He placed the shotgun beneath his chin, pulled the trigger and committed suicide. He then fell to the ground with the cameras still rolling and playing the event live to viewers watching at home. Jones died at the age of forty, roughly two weeks after his birthday.|$|E
60|$|Presently, Edward {{stopped at}} a gateway, and Wegg discreetly lost no time in {{slipping}} out at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck.</b> The moment he was landed, his late driver {{with a wave of}} the carrot, said 'Supper, Eddard!' and he, the hind hoofs, the truck, and Edward, all seemed to fly into the air together, in a kind of apotheosis.|$|E
50|$|Charmagne Peters has {{followed}} the tour to Bristol, and she slips into the cemetery to get some quotes from the audience. But there are no answers here, just raw, angry enthusiasm for the violence which has been let loose; soon the divisions between the classes will be torn down forever. Charmagne tries {{to catch a glimpse}} of what lies inside <b>the</b> cattle <b>truck,</b> but flees in horror when she sees a dead grey eye staring out through a crack at her. She later returns, determined to face down her fears and learn more, but that's a mistake; the roadies are waiting for her, and they fling her into <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cattle <b>truck,</b> where she finds herself in an impossibly open space. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cattle <b>truck</b> stretches out across a moor, the same moor where she and her father used to play hide and seek, until one day she hid too well and he suffered a heart attack from <b>the</b> exertion <b>of</b> looking for her.

60|$|How long I slept I do not know, but I woke up {{suddenly}} with all feelings of exhilaration gone, {{and only the}} consciousness of oppressive difficulties heavy on me. I must leave the train before daybreak, so that I could drink at a pool and find some hiding-place {{while it was still}} dark. Another night I would board another train. I crawled from my cosy hiding-place among the sacks and sat again on the couplings. The train was running at a fair speed, but I felt {{it was time to leave}} it. I took hold of the iron handle at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck,</b> pulled strongly with my left hand, and sprang. My feet struck the ground in two gigantic strides, and the next instant I was sprawling in the ditch, considerably shaken but unhurt.
