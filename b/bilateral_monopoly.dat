This study investigates optimal disclosure strategies/formats in a channel setting with <b>bilateral</b> <b>monopolies.</b> It shows that retail disclosure leads to more equilibrium information revelation. This is because the manufacturer can, through wholesale price cuts, partially absorb the retailer's effective disclosure cost and thus increase the retailer's incentive for disclosure. The conditions under which a particular disclosure format arises as the manufacturer's optimal choice are also examined. Even though direct disclosure is the ex post dominated option, the manufacturer may benefit from committing ex ante to the direct disclosure format when the cost of disclosure is sufficiently high. communication, disclosure, disclosure format, distribution channel, quality...|$|R

While previous studies showed that coop programs increase total channel profits in <b>bilateral</b> <b>monopolies,</b> no evidence of such a result has been provided for channels where competition is present at the manufacturing and the retailing levels. In this paper, we consider a distribution channel formed by two manufacturers and two retailers and propose a model that accounts for brand and store substitution effects generated by the retailer's promotional efforts. The efficiency of the coop plan is investigated by comparing equilibria of four non-cooperative games; one where manufacturers do not offer any promotional support to the retailers, one where manufacturers do offer such a support and two scenarios where in turn only one manufacturer is offering such program. We show that when competition is introduced, coop ad programs {{may be due to}} a prisonner's dilemma situation for the manufacturers. The benefit for retailers and consumers is also assessed.

40|$|International {{bond markets}} {{have become an}} {{increasingly}} important source of long-term capital for infrastructure projects in emerging market economies over the past decade. The Ras Laffan Liquified Natural Gas (Ras Gas) project represents a milestone in this respect: its $ 1. 2 billion bond offering, completed in December 1996, has been the largest for any international project. The Ras Gas project {{has the right to}} extract, process, and sell liquefied natural gas (LNG) from a field off the shore of Qatar. The principal off-taker is the Korea Gas Corporation (Kogas), which resells most of the LNG to the Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) for electricity generation. In this clinical study the authors analyze the determinants of credit spreads for the Ras Gas project in terms of its contractual structure, with a view to better understanding the role of contract design in facilitating access to the global project bond market. Market risk perceptions have long been recognized to be a function of firm-specific variables, particularly asset value as embodied in contracts. The authors therefore study the impact of three interlocking contracts on the credit spreads of the project's actively traded global bonds: the 25 -year output sales and purchase agreement with Kogas-Kepco, the international bond covenant, and an output price-contingent debt service guarantee by Mobil to debt holders. Using a sample of daily data from January 1997 to March 2000, the authors find that the quality of the off-taker's credit-and, more important, the market's assessment of the off-taker's economic prospects-drive project bond credit spreads and pricing. In addition, seemingly unrelated events in emerging debt markets spill over to project bond markets and affect risk perceptions and prices in this segment. Judicious use of an output price-contingent debt service guarantee by shareholders can significantly reduce project risks, and markets reward issuers through tighter credit spreads. Bondholders and shareholders share residual risks over time, despite covenants meant to preempt risk shifting. This type of risk shifting originates from incomplete contracts and the nonrecourse nature of project finance. It does not necessarily result from a deliberate attempt by management to increase shareholder value at the expense of debt holders by pursuing high-risk, low-value activities, although project managers and shareholders could still exploit their informational advantages by leaving output supply contracts incomplete in ways beneficial to their private interests. The results hold important lessons for global project finance. Projects incorporating certain design features can reap significant financial gains through lower borrowing costs and longer debt maturities: Judicious guarantees by parents that enjoy a particular hedging advantage enhance a project's appeal, as reflected in favorable pricing. Pledging receivables rather than physical assets as collateral and administering investor cash flows through an off-shore account offers additional security to debt holders. Projects should use their liability structure to create an implicit option on future private debt financing that matches the real option of a project expansion. The finding that bondholders bear residual risks means that shareholders can reduce their risks arising from <b>bilateral</b> <b>monopolies</b> and buy insurance against unforeseen and unforeseeable events.

40|$|Five {{years after}} the {{implementation}} of the UK health and social care reforms it is still difficult to evaluate objectively their success or failure. It is an opportune time to stand back and assess what were the real objectives of the reforms, and what have been their essential features. The reason for this is not to dwell upon history, but rather to provide an objective assessment of the future contribution which economics can make to the markets which have evolved. Six main conclusions emerge from this overview of the UK health reforms and the contribution of economics. There is a need to guard against the development of local <b>bilateral</b> <b>monopolies,</b> which have considerable implications for the nature of market regulation required. Consideration should be given to ways in which competition can be stimulated on the purchasing side of the market; this is particularly important given the continued spread of GP fundholding and the lack of information available for consumers to assess the purchasing ability of their GPs, not to mention their host Health Authorities. The importance of culture needs to be recognised, in particular achieving a balance between cooperation and competition. The incomplete and asymmetric nature of information in health and social care must be recognised. There is a need to evaluate seriously the potential of information and communications technology in reducing the degree of imperfect information and thereby the level of transaction costs. Finally, improving the information base on the volume, quality and cost of services could do more than any structural reform to secure efficiency gains. It is a moot point whether this requires a quasi-market and competitive pressures, but if it is the demand/supply separation which has focused attention upon the general paucity of information, then the reforms have made progress. At least three central themes demand attention from economists in any future research agenda in health economics: 1) the measurement and valuation of the impact of health and social care interventions (“outcomes research”); 2) analysis of health and social care markets; and 3) the economics of information, The last of these may in time become the most important, as the presence of imperfect information constitutes a significant constraint to outcomes research and the development of health and social care markets. Its importance should not be underestimated given the conclusion of Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) that “some of the most important conclusions of economic theory are not robust to considerations of imperfect information”. This paper takes a preliminary look firstly at the nature of information generally, recognising its public good and externality dimensions, and secondly at information within the context of health. Focusing upon informational asymmetries is critical un understanding the various forms of strategic behaviour which characterise health and social care markets. Given that such markets in practice are characterised by imperfect information, with perfect information an unattainable ideal, consideration is given to different definitions of efficient levels of investment in information about health and social care services. Individual patients and service users (either on their own or through the agency relationship), as well as parties to formal contracts, will expend time and energy attempting to reduce the degree of information imperfection. Useful insights can be gained from the literature on optimal search strategies, with important implications for the level of transaction costs generally in health and social care contracting. Recognising the importance of imperfect information and strategic behaviour in turn will influence {{the nature and extent of}} regulation required in monopolistic or oligopolistic markets. reform...|$|R

50|$|Eventually Los Angeles {{acquired}} {{a large portion}} of the water rights to over 300,000 acres of land in the valley, almost completely diverting the inflows of water away from Owens Lake. This acquisition was made following negotiations in which Los Angeles and the Owens Valley farmers were engaged in a <b>bilateral</b> <b>monopoly.</b> By modern estimates, Los Angeles would have been willing to pay up to $8.70 per acre-foot ($7.05/thousand cubic meters) of water. Eventually the average actual transaction price was near $4.00 per acre-foot ($3.25/thousand cubic meters). The next best option was continuing to use the land for agricultural uses, which fetched a much lower price. Although this price was lower than Los Angeles' willingness to pay, the farmers of Owens Valley received a premium for their land compared to land values in neighboring counties. More over, the farmers who resisted the longest during the Owens Valley Transfers were able to sell their land for even higher prices than the average farmer received due to Los Angeles' willingness to settle. As a result of these acquisitions, the lake subsequently dried up completely, leaving the present alkali flat which plagues the southern valley with alkali dust storms.|$|E
