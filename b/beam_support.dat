25|$|The north {{transept}} (or Priory End) windows, {{east and}} north, are 19th century but within 14th-century openings. The trussed roof is possibly 16th century with tie <b>beam</b> <b>support</b> {{added in the}} 19th. The south transept (or Hall End) east and south windows are 14th century although partly restored. The 15th-century south transept roof trussing is of hammer beam construction, with curved collar braces springing from beams which are supported by curved chamfered brackets. Running on the wall from the hammer beams to the roof line are wind braces, and to the ridge beam is roof truss framing. Both transepts are separated from the nave by c.20th-century panels and doors rising part {{way to the top}} of the arches. The north transept is solid panelling; the south with clear glazed doors to its full width. The north transept is today used as the church vestry room, and the south transept a meeting room with modern furniture. On the south wall of the south transept is a 14th-century piscina with a recessed trefoiled head, a re-cut quatrefoil drain, a head of a woman in a wimple carved at its apex, and a finial above.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was {{modelling}} of shaft and calculation of natural vibration frequencies and critical rotations of a large-size, vertical mixed flow pump of total length l= 4866 mm. Equations of motion were determined analytically, and then calculation results were verified by numerical modelling. The difficulty of the problem consisted in the shaft bearing, in which four hydrodynamic bearings of unknown parameters were applied. A four-mass <b>beam</b> <b>supported</b> on flexible supports of rigidity k and damping c was assumed as the discrete model of the shaft. Equations of motion for the system were derived with the method of forces. In order to verify correctness of the derived equations, one considered three models of the <b>beam</b> with different <b>support</b> configuration: the <b>beam</b> <b>supported</b> on rigid <b>supports,</b> the <b>beam</b> <b>supported</b> on elastic <b>supports,</b> and the <b>beam</b> <b>supported</b> on flexible supports of rigidity k and damping c.

5000|$|No.1 Gun Emplacement: This is {{the most}} {{dominant}} and visually striking structure within the group, and along with the No.2 Gun is centrally located behind the first dune. This symmetrical two- storeyed structure consists of a raised concrete platform, with buttressed supports, on which the six inch gun was fixed facing east. The structure {{is open to the}} east, curved to allow a wide angle of sight, and has a central metal gun mounting. It originally had steel doors. The western side of the platform is enclosed, with a shell handling facility on the northern side which accessed the storage area below. The platform is accessed from the west via an external concrete stair on the central east-west axis. The form of the structure, and the method of ascension, gives a sense of ritual and discovery. The platform is roofed by heavy timber logs, cantilevered to the east, with timber boarding and concrete above and cement filled hessian bag infill. Large timber post and <b>beam</b> <b>support</b> members are located on the exterior walls. Remnants of painted camouflage are visible on the northern wall. The ground floor contains a room at the southwest with the remains of a duty roster on the northern wall, with another room to the east of this. Shell storage rooms are located on the northern side.|$|E

All flooring is plain red tiling {{except on the}} raised chancel sanctuary behind the altar rail where there is added bands of black, white and brown. The chancel east window {{is part of the}} 19th-century restoration, but {{with the use of a}} c. 1270 capital detail. The c. 1270 chamfered rebated chancel arch has a hood mould finished with human head label stops on both chancel and nave sides. Set within the arch is a further chamfered arch supported by responds - half-piers attached to walls supporting an arch - of semi-circular columns with flat-face faceted moulded bases, and foliate capitals that have been part-restored. A 19th-century-added arched squint is on each side of the chancel arch, each with a chamfered rebate as part of the arch. Set above each squint on the chancel side is a gable as moulding with, at its spring and point, a carved foliated detail.

40|$|The {{formation}} of scour patterns at bridge piers {{is driven by}} the forces at the boundary of the water flow. In most experimental scour studies, indirect processes have been applied to estimate the shear stress using measured velocity profiles. The estimations are based on theoretical models and associated assumptions. However, the turbulence flow fields and boundary layer in the pier-scour region are very complex and lead to low-fidelity results. In addition, available turbulence models cannot account accurately for the bed roughness effect. Direct measurement of the boundary shear stress, normal stress, and their fluctuations are attractive alternatives. However, most direct-measurement shear sensors are bulky in size or not compatible to fluid flow. A sensor has been developed that consists of a floating plate with folded <b>beam</b> <b>support</b> and an optical grid on the back, combined with a high-resolution optical position probe. The folded <b>beam</b> <b>support</b> makes the floating plate more flexible in the sensing direction within a small footprint, while maintaining high stiffness in the other directions. The floating plate converts the shear force to displacement, and the optical probe detects the plate s position with nanometer resolution by sensing the pattern of the diffraction field of the grid through a glass window. This configuration makes the sensor compatible with liquid flow applications...|$|E
