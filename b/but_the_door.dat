5|$|While Parvati {{settles into}} her new house, Devadasu chooses {{the path of}} self-destruction. On the advice of Chandramukhi, he leaves for his village, but goes to Durgapuram to keep a promise he had made to Parvati that he visit her before his death. Devadasu {{breathes}} his last {{in front of her}} house. Parvati rushes to see him, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is closed by her family and she collapses.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, Spooner, alone, stands {{from his}} chair and {{attempts}} to leave, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is locked. Briggs soon enters to deliver Spooner food and champagne, rambling on about how he met Foster and ignoring Spooner's desire to know why the door was locked. Spooner thinks of a quick excuse to leave; however, when Briggs mentions that both Foster and Hirst are poets, Spooner shows vague recognition of this fact.|$|E
25|$|Columbus and his {{brothers}} were jailed for six weeks before the busy King Ferdinand ordered them released. Not long thereafter, {{the king and queen}} summoned the Columbus brothers to their presence at the Alhambra palace in Granada. There the royal couple heard the brothers' pleas; restored their freedom and their wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus's fourth voyage. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was firmly shut on Christopher Columbus's role as governor. From that point forward, Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres was to be the new Governor of the Indies.|$|E
60|$|Before {{they went}} to sleep they {{carefully}} barred <b>the</b> <b>door</b> from Rinkitink's room to <b>the</b> corridor, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> that connected <b>the</b> three rooms one with another were left wide open.|$|R
5000|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> {{stay within}} <b>the</b> car's track {{throughout}} their range of movement, they are useful when parking in tight spaces. A gullwing door style offers similar visibility, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> swing {{out from the}} car's area slightly.|$|R
50|$|The new METU Northern Cyprus Campus, about 50 km west of (Nicosia) on {{the island}} of Cyprus, {{admitted}} its first students during the academic year 2002 - 2003, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were officially opened in Cyprus in September 2005.|$|R

The mystery. The intrigue. Specifically, where is Victoria Principal?" [...] Entertainment Weekly said that Principal was [...] "certainly missed" [...] as original character Pam when reviewing the new series. Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy said that Principal was [...] "unlikely" [...] {{to return to the}} new series due to lack of interest in the project, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> would always be open. He said, [...] "She's indicated that it's something she's not interested in." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{main part}} Ones story {{takes place at}} a Japanese high school, though little is shown except for Kōhei's classroom, the cafeteria, and {{a little of the}} {{surrounding}} area. The main school building is three-stories, and the roof is accessible, albeit with a sign on the roof's access door saying [...] "No Entry", <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is never locked regardless. Adjacent to the main building is another which houses club rooms. The school borders a forest on one side with a chain link fence. Beyond the forest is a park with a fountain and a flight of stairs on a hill. Other than the school, the shopping district in town and the usual path Kōhei takes to school are shown, but otherwise the only other place depicted is Kōhei's two-story house.|$|E
500|$|The trains left Liverpool on {{time and}} without any {{technical}} problems. The Duke of Wellington's special train ran on one track, and the other seven trains ran on an adjacent and parallel track, sometimes ahead and sometimes behind the Duke's train. Around [...] out of Liverpool {{the first of many}} problems occurred, when one of the trains derailed and the following train collided with it. With no reported injuries or damage, the derailed locomotive was lifted back onto the track and the journey continued. At Parkside railway station, near the midpoint of the line, the locomotives made a scheduled stop to take on water. Although the railway staff advised passengers to remain on the trains while this took place, around 50 of the dignitaries on board alighted when the Duke of Wellington's special train stopped. One of those who got off was William Huskisson, former cabinet minister and Member of Parliament for Liverpool. Huskisson had been a highly influential figure {{in the creation of the}} British Empire and an architect of the doctrine of free trade, but had fallen out with Wellington in 1828 over the issue of parliamentary reform and had resigned from the cabinet. Hoping to be reconciled with Wellington, he approached the Duke's railway carriage and shook his hand. Distracted by the Duke, he did not notice an approaching locomotive on the adjacent track, Rocket. On realising it was approaching he panicked and tried to clamber into the Duke's carriage, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the carriage swung open leaving him hanging directly in the path of the oncoming Rocket. He fell onto the tracks in front of the train, suffering serious leg injuries and dying later that night.|$|E
50|$|In July 2012, a WWE RAW {{pyrotechnic}} rehearsal {{caused a}} small fire on the led wall before doors opened. Crews put it out before it could get any bigger. No one was injured <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were opened thirty minutes late.|$|R
50|$|Glass {{doors and}} windows were added in 1986 for security, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were removed in 2004. In summer 2007, {{extensive}} repairs {{were made to the}} tower, including restoration of the roof, and removal of the windows, which were not original to the building.|$|R

2500|$|On {{realising}} his danger he {{panicked and}} made two attempts {{to cross the}} other line, but {{changed his mind and}} returned to the Duke's carriage. At this point Joseph Locke became aware and threw Rocket into reverse, but it would have taken 10 seconds to have any effect. Huskisson then panicked that the gap between the two trains was not big enough and so tried to clamber into the Duke's carriage, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the carriage swung open leaving him hanging directly {{in the path of the}} oncoming Rocket, which hit the door, throwing Huskisson onto the tracks in front of the train. [...] His leg was horrifically mangled by the locomotive.|$|E
2500|$|Since her {{departure}} {{she told}} the Bristol Evening Post that she {{has no plans to}} return saying,"I just got quite bored in the end, to be honest. Doing the same thing day in, day out. It's just so boring. I like to jump from different things." [...] "I always saw EastEnders as an apprenticeship," [...] {{she told the}} Daily Record. [...] "I always wanted to go on and do different things. I have some really good friends from that show <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is closed." [...] She said: [...] "I've always taken chances. I think that's how you progress – by stepping out and doing different things. I really do like my freedom and jumping from job to job. I just want to work with people I admire and respect, wherever that be – big budget, low budget, leading role, supporting role." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 'January' , the Fellowship of the Ring {{travelled}} through Moria {{on the way}} to Mount Doom. They {{were attacked}} in the Chamber of Mazarbul by Orcs. The Fellowship fled through a side door, but when the wizard Gandalf the Grey tried to place a [...] "shutting spell" [...] on the door to block the pursuit behind them, the Balrog entered the chamber {{on the other side and}} cast a [...] "terrible" [...] counterspell. Gandalf spoke a word of Command to stay the door, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> shattered and the chamber collapsed. Gandalf was severely weakened by this encounter. The company fled with him, but the Orcs and the Balrog, taking a different route, caught up with them at the bridge of Khazad-dûm. The Elf Legolas instantly recognized the Balrog and Gandalf tried to hold the bridge against it. As Gandalf faced the Balrog he proclaimed, [...] "You cannot pass, flame of Udûn!", and broke the bridge beneath the Balrog. As it fell, the Balrog wrapped its whip about Gandalf's knees, dragging him to the brink. As the Fellowship looked on in horror, Gandalf cried [...] "Fly, you fools!" [...] and plunged into the darkness below.|$|E

2500|$|Mazda {{introduced}} the 10th Anniversary RX-7 in 1988 as a {{limited production run}} based on the RX-7 Turbo II. Production was limited to 1,500 models. The 10th Anniversary RX-7 features a Crystal White (paint code UC) monochromatic paint scheme with matching white body side mouldings, taillight housings, mirrors and 16-inch alloy 7-spoke wheels. There were two [...] "series" [...] of 10th Anniversary models, with essentially a VIN-split running production change between the two. The most notable difference between the series {{can be found on}} the exterior- the earlier [...] "Series I" [...] cars had a black [...] "Mazda" [...] logo decal on the front bumper cover, whereas most if not all [...] "Series II" [...] cars did not have the decal. Series II cars also received the lower seat cushion height/tilt feature that Series I cars lacked. Another distinctive exterior feature is the bright gold rotor-shaped 10th Anniversary Edition badge on the front fenders (yellow-gold on the Series II cars). A distinctive 10th Anniversary package feature is the all black leather interior (code D7), which included not just the seats, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> panel inserts as well and a leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel (with 10th Anniversary Edition embossed horn button) and MOMO leather shift knob with integrated boot. All exterior glass is bronze tinted (specific in North America to only the 10th Anniversary), and the windshield was equipped with the embedded secondary antenna also found on some other select models with the upgraded stereo packages. Other 10th Anniversary Edition specific items were headlight washers (the only RX-7 in the US market that got this feature), glass breakage detectors added to the factory alarm system, 10th Anniversary Edition logoed floormats, 10th Anniversary Edition embroidered front hood protector and accompanying front end mask (or [...] "bra"), and an aluminum under pan.|$|E
2500|$|Rawle {{explained}} that Silas has accepted {{he is to}} be in the secure psychiatric unit until he dies so he plans to manipulate the outside world from inside as a means of living out his murderous fantasies. Rawle revealed that Silas has a [...] "nagging feeling" [...] that he made a mistake in killing India and that he wishes he could put it right. He said that his character meant to murder Texas so he now wants to kill her as she is the [...] "one that got away". Hendrickse-Spendlove also commented that Silas initially intended to kill Texas so she is [...] "the final piece of the puzzle for him, and then his 'work' will be complete". Silas tells Texas another murder will soon occur which is an opportunity to [...] "play games". He is [...] "delighted" [...] to have an audience during the visits and begins to [...] "make lots of threats". Rawle {{explained that}} Silas sees that Texas has India's ring which is [...] "symbolic" [...] for Silas as he had previously taken it as a trophy. Texas taunts Silas with the ring and agrees to exchange it for information on Lynsey's murder. Rawle explained that Silas tells Texas that Will Savage (James Atherton) is responsible for Lynsey's murder which is because [...] "Silas knows that Texas and Will are close, so he points the finger of suspicion his way". He said that Silas would [...] "put quite a few people in the frame" [...] for the murder. Hendrickse-Spendlove said that Texas is [...] "manipulated" [...] by Silas when he makes her believe Will is responsible for Lynsey's murder. Silas escapes from hospital and goes to visit Texas. Hendrickse-Spendlove explained that Texas [...] "opens her front door, sees Silas and thinks, 'This is it - my life is over', to see him standing there with no police restraint, knowing that he murdered her sister India, is absolutely petrifying". Silas tells Texas that he now intends to complete what he began. Hendrickse-Spendlove would not reveal whether Texas survives the ordeal but said that Texas is [...] "never going to be safe again" [...] regardless of the outcome. In August 2012, Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap confirmed that there were no current plans for Silas to return, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> had been left open for him. On 20 January 2016, Silas is set to return to visit Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) in prison after he was framed by Lindsey Butterfield (Sophie Austin) for the murders and attempted murders at Dee Valley Hospital. Silas left again after he killed Lindsey.|$|E
