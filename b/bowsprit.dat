5|$|In April 1804, President Jefferson {{decided to}} {{reinforce}} Preble's squadron. President, Congress, Constellation, and Essex prepared to sail {{as soon as}} possible under the direction of Commodore Samuel Barron. Barron selected President as his flagship, but she required a new <b>bowsprit</b> and repairs to her masts and rigging. Some two months passed before the squadron was ready to sail. They departed in late June and arrived at Gibraltar on 12August.|$|E
5|$|On 8 October 1892, a storm-damaged vessel, Sirene, hit the {{southern}} {{side of the}} pier, causing four shops {{and part of the}} deck to collapse onto the beach below. Several columns were also dislodged, and the ship's <b>bowsprit</b> hit the pier entrance. All eleven crew members were rescued when they were hauled onto the pier. Damage to the pier was estimated to be £5,000 and was promptly repaired.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1660s, a {{building}} program was initiated {{to expand the}} fleet and replace old capital ships. A new flagship was needed to replace the old Kronan from 1632. The felling of vast quantities of timber that were required for the new admiral's ship had already begun {{in the winter of}} 1664–65. Swedish historian Kurt Lundgren has estimated that 7–10 hectares (17–25 acres) of hundred-year-old oak forest was required for the hull and several tall, stout pines for the masts and <b>bowsprit.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... • LH designates {{the length}} of hull as {{measured}} by IRC, excluding <b>bowsprits</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{measure of}} length is LWL (loaded {{waterline}} length) {{which is more}} useful in assessing a vessel's performance. In some cases (particularly old yachts or vessels with <b>bowsprits)</b> LWL can be considerably shorter than LOA.|$|R
50|$|In ISO 8666 {{for small}} boats, {{there is a}} {{definition}} of LOH, or length of hull,. This may be shorter than a vessel's LOA, because it excludes other parts attached to the hull, such as <b>bowsprits.</b>|$|R
5|$|Mike {{continues}} to blast the shark with the impulses, {{causing it to}} leap {{out of the water}} again, igniting the bomb as Ellen steers the sailboat towards the shark while thinking back to Sean's demise, the shark's attack on Thea, and when her husband killed the first shark. The broken <b>bowsprit</b> impales the shark in the exact spot where the bomb is, causing it to explode on impact. The shark's corpse then sinks {{to the bottom of the}} sea. Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured, but alive and conscious, floating in the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land. Hoagie then flies Ellen back to Amity Island.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1800, Clarisse {{captured}} a large rice-laden merchantman, the British James. On 3 January, she detected two American 16-carronade ships forming {{a line of}} battle; although Clarisse lacked the eight guns sacrificed to escape Sybille and 60 of her men detached on her various prizes, Surcouf engaged. Clarisse raked the rear-most ship, the Louisa, and boarded her, while simultaneously firing a broadside on the other ship, Mercury, which attempted to rescue her mate. Nicolas Surcouf led a 30-man boarding party to seize Louisa, while Mercury escaped. Clarisse could not give chase, her <b>bowsprit</b> having been destroyed in the collision with Louisa. Nicolas Surcouf took a prize crew and sailed Louisa back to Port Louis.|$|E
5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower masts in {{wood was}} not feasible, {{so they were}} made of steel tube cut and welded to shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the {{platforms}} on the masts. The three masts and the <b>bowsprit</b> were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. Warriors engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron to duplicate the look of the real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they might have looked in operation.|$|E
50|$|A Pelicans {{is one of}} {{a series}} of boats {{designed}} by Captain Bill Short with Pelican names, including the Pelican (12’) in 1959the Great Pelican (16’) and the Pacific Pelican (14’7”). All are prams with <b>bowsprits</b> and lug rigs.|$|R
5000|$|Looking east, {{was seen}} in the {{distance}} on the long river front from Coenties Slip to Catharine Street , innumerable masts of the many Californian clippers and London and Liverpool packets, with their long <b>bowsprits</b> extending way over South Street, reaching nearly to the opposite side.|$|R
50|$|The colony's {{lightweight}} Bermuda cedar vessels {{were widely}} prized for their agility and speed, especially upwind. The high, raked masts and long <b>bowsprits</b> and booms favoured in Bermuda allowed its vessels {{of all sizes}} to carry vast areas of sail when running down-wind with spinnakers and multiple jibs, allowing great speeds to be reached. Bermudian work boats, mostly small sloops, were ubiquitous on the archipelago's waters in the 19th century, moving freight, people, and everything else about. The rig was eventually adopted almost universally on small sailing craft in the 20th Century, although as seen on most modern vessels {{it is very much}} less extreme than on traditional Bermudian designs, with lower, vertical masts, shorter booms, omitted <b>bowsprits,</b> and much less area of canvas.|$|R
5|$|The {{measurements}} for Kronan {{were recorded in}} contemporary navy lists. Its length from stem post to stern post was 53m (174ft); this was considerably shorter than the length if the <b>bowsprit</b> and beakhead were included. The width was 12.9m (42ft) and {{was defined as the}} widest point between the frames, excluding planking. The draft varied depending on how heavily she was laden, but with full stores, ammunition and armaments it would have been about 6.2–6.8m (20–22ft). The height of the ship from keel to the highest mast was never recorded, but Kalmar County Museum has estimated it to have been at least 66m (217ft).|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of the rigging survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll {{have been used to}} determine how the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the foremast and mainmast had two and three square sails respectively; the mizzen mast had a lateen sail and a small square sail and the bonaventure mizzen had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the <b>bowsprit</b> flew a small square spritsail. According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), the yards (the spars from which the sails were set) on the foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.|$|E
5|$|At 20:45, with Jason {{far behind}} in the darkness, Mars hauled up and Hood {{attempted}} to manoeuvre into an effective position from which to attack the waiting Hercule. The vagaries of the current in the Raz de Sein passage prevented Hood from handling his ship effectively however and instead he resolved on bringing Mars directly alongside and fighting broadside to broadside. At 21:15 Mars was in range and L'Héritier opened fire, Hood replying immediately. For ten minutes, the masts and rigging of Mars came under fire, with damage to the <b>bowsprit</b> and foremast, as Hood continued to attempt to hold his firing position against the current before pulling slightly ahead of Hercule at 21:25 and dropping anchor. The port bow anchor became entangled with the starboard anchor on Hercule and the British ship was swung violently into the French ship, {{the force of the}} collision unhinging four of the gunports on Mars.|$|E
50|$|The modern 12s {{also have}} fixed <b>bowsprits</b> {{to carry the}} spinnakers from. This is a {{relatively}} recent innovation, with the older style of skiff having an 'end to end' spinnaker pole which {{would need to be}} positioned by the crew, and would be stored against the skiff's boom when it was not being used.|$|R
40|$|The Navy {{astragal}} {{represents the}} vessels {{used in the}} Civil War. <b>Bowsprits</b> of the vessels extend ten feet beyond the stone work. It was designed by George W. Brewster of Cleveland, Ohio. The Army astragal represents the implements and carnage of war and is twelve feet high. It was designed by Nicolaus Geiger of Berlin, Germany...|$|R
50|$|At one point, the {{two ships}} rotated {{together}} counter-clockwise, with Constitution continuing to fire broadsides. When the two ships pulled apart, {{the force of}} the <b>bowsprit's</b> extraction sent shock waves through Guerrieres rigging. Her foremast collapsed, and that brought the mainmast down shortly afterward. Guerriere was now a dismasted, unmanageable hulk with close to a third of her crew wounded or killed, while Constitution remained largely intact. The British surrendered.|$|R
5|$|Casualties {{were heavy}} on both sides, and both vessels were in such poor {{condition}} that each commander {{thought he had}} sunk his opponent. Most of La Vengeance rigging had been blown away; only the lower foremast, lower mizzenmast, and <b>bowsprit</b> were operational. Pitot set course for Curaçao {{and was forced to}} ground his vessel there to prevent her from sinking. The number of French casualties is somewhat unclear: official French accounts report 28 dead and 40 wounded, while accounts from Curaçao state that the French frigate had lost 160 men. Once Pitot reached Curaçao he was beset with further problems. La Vengeance remained out of action for months due to difficulties in acquiring support needed to repair the frigate from the Dutch officials there. A French expedition to seize the island brought the materiel needed to repair the frigate, but when asked to help attack the island Pitot refused and slipped away to Guadaloupe.|$|E
5|$|Droits de l'Homme {{had been}} more seriously damaged than the British frigates, and was closer to shore at the time land was spotted. As Lacrosse's crew made desperate efforts to turn southwards, the ship's {{foremast}} and <b>bowsprit</b> collapsed {{under the pressure of}} the wind. With the ship virtually unmanageable, Lacrosse ordered the anchors lowered in an attempt to hold the ship in position until repairs could be made. This effort was futile, as all but two anchors had been lost during efforts to hold position in Bantry Bay, and British gunfire had damaged one of the anchor cables and rendered it useless. The final anchor was deployed, but it failed to restrain the ship and at 07:00 (according to the French account), the Droits de l'Homme struck a sandbank close to the town of Plozévet. This broke off the remaining mast and caused the ship to heel over onto her side.|$|E
5|$|The French were {{initially}} {{unable to take}} possession of the fourth rate as {{every single one of}} the boats on board had been smashed by British shot. In the end, a French midshipman and a boatswain dived into the sea and swam to the British ship to take the formal surrender. Leander had lost a third of the crew: 35 men killed and 57 wounded, the latter including Thompson three times and Berry, who had a piece of human skull lodged in his arm. The ship had been completely dismasted except the stubs of the fore and main masts and the <b>bowsprit,</b> and was leaking badly from dozens of shot holes. Généreux had also been damaged, losing the mizzen topmast and almost losing the foremast as well. Losses on the crowded decks had been far more severe than on Leander, with casualties estimated at 100 killed and 188 wounded, again approximately a third of the total.|$|E
6000|$|... "I propose, Egbert," [...] Edmund said, [...] "that as we {{go along}} we cut the mooring-ropes of all the vessels. We must do it quietly so as not to excite any alarm, and they will know nothing of it until they find {{themselves}} drifting down the river in a mass. Then there will be great jostling and carrying away of <b>bowsprits</b> and bulwarks, and the confusion and shouting which will arise will tend to confuse the Danes and to distract their attention from us." ...|$|R
6000|$|His {{fleet of}} nearly two hundred fishing-smacks lay bobbing about one fine autumn evening on the North Sea. The vessels cruised round each other, out and in, hither and thither, in all positions, now on this tack, now on that, <b>bowsprits</b> {{pointing}} north, south, east, and west, as if without purpose, or {{engaged in a}} nautical game of [...] "touch." [...] Nevertheless all eyes were bent earnestly on the admiral's vessel, for it was literally the [...] "flagship," [...] being distinguishable only by a small flag attached to its fore stay.|$|R
60|$|What Bryce {{called a}} {{chopping}} and a lumpy sea was running. It was decidedly rough, though the breeze was moderate, {{so that the}} smacks all round were alternately presenting sterns and <b>bowsprits</b> to the sky in a violent manner that might have suggested {{the idea of a}} rearing and kicking dance. When the carrier steamed up to the Admiral, and lay to beside him, and the smacks drew towards her from all points of the compass, the mazes of the dance became intricate, and the risk of collisions called for careful steering.|$|R
5|$|The Lucera, {{trying the}} same evasive tactic, {{was the next}} galley attacked; a Dutch galleot, which drove under full sail managed to ram her. The galley was struck between the {{mainmast}} and stern, with a blow which carried away the assailant's own <b>bowsprit,</b> but in return completely demolished {{the stern of the}} galley. Vice-Admiral Cant came up once more in the Half-moon, and finished Lucera (Morning Star) off by ramming, tearing the galley apart. Meanwhile, Victory and two States' galleots were chasing two galleys; San Juan and Jacinto who were already in a sinking state. With nowhere to escape and the gale blowing against them, the only option was for the respective commanders to run them aground near Nieuwpoort. In the end, both galleys succeeded in reaching the safety of Niewpoort. Another galley managed to evade the Dutch and English long enough but it too ended up being wrecked on the French coast near Calais. The galley San Luis, which bore Spinola himself and his thirty-six pay chests, attempted to reach Dunkirk, but as the tide was low, she was forced to wait beyond a sandbank. Ten Dutch ships fell upon San Luis, but Spinola succeeded in sailing between the Dutch vessels and reached Dunkirk. With this the battle had ended and a Dutch blockade formed to prevent Spinola's escape.|$|E
5|$|Warrior {{was ordered}} on 11 May 1859 from Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company in Blackwall, London. The ship was laid down {{some time after}} 6 June 1859 on the West Ham side of Bow Creek when the P ocean liner Seine was launched, and the slipway was {{reinforced}} to support Warriors weight. Full-scale production of the ship's iron began in August, and the construction probably began in mid-August. Indecision by the Admiralty and frequent design changes caused many delays and nearly drove her builders bankrupt before a grant of £50,000 was awarded to keep them solvent. Her launching on 29 December 1860 was during the coldest winter for 50 years. She was frozen to her slipway and required the use of hydraulic rams, additional tugs, and dockworkers running {{from side to side}} on the upper deck to rock her free. Warrior was commissioned in August 1861 to conduct her sea trials; she was completed on 24 October for £377,292, almost twice the cost of a contemporary wooden ship of the line. Between March and June 1862, defects exposed during her trials were rectified, and damage repaired. Changes included the fitting of a lighter <b>bowsprit</b> and a shorter jib boom, along with the provision of extra heads amidships.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 2008, the ship’s <b>bowsprit</b> broke during a storm. The Falkland Islands Museum & National Trust has {{discussed}} removing the <b>bowsprit.</b>|$|E
50|$|Descended {{from small}} boats carried by 18th century British {{merchant}} {{ships in the}} new world, {{around the turn of}} the 20th century, catboats were adapted for racing, and long booms and gaffs, <b>bowsprits</b> and large jibs were fitted to capture as much wind as possible. The decline of racing and advent of small, efficient gasoline engines eliminated the need for large sailplans, and catboats today are used as pleasure craft for day sailing and cruising, and have the virtues of roominess, stability and simple handling, though many catboats have poorer upwind performance than well-designed sloop-rigged craft.|$|R
50|$|Acquired by Richard Seymour-Conway, the 4th Marquess of Hertford, by 1865, and {{possibly}} {{from the collection}} of Marie-Gabriel-Florens-Auguste, comte de Choiseul, known as Choiseul-Gouffier, this is the third of the ship-shaped vases designed by Jean-Claude Duplessis père (active 1748-74) in the 1750s. The naval theme is emphasised by the faceted <b>bowsprits</b> in the mouths of the marine masks and is a reminder that at this time the French navy was involved in the Seven Years’ War (1756-63). The Wallace Collection example dates from 1761, composed of soft-paste porcelain, is painted and gilded, and is 44.1 x 36.9 cm.|$|R
5000|$|Two foot skiffs {{also known}} as ‘Balmain Bugs’ were model racing skiffs [...] {{typically}} raced on Sydney Harbour between the 1890s and 1950s. The model skiffs were crafted by shipwrights in their spare time. In the sports hey days the 1940s and 1950s there were up to 10 clubs at Abbotsford, Drummoyne, Balmain, North Sydney and Double Bay. [...] They raced with large rigs including four foot <b>bowsprits</b> to hold the oversize jib and spinnaker, with masts which were up to 10 ft high, the keel {{was designed as a}} dagger blade fin with a lead bulb weighing up to 24 lb.|$|R

25|$|Seeing {{the smaller}} ship {{directly}} in front of him, the French captain spread all sail and threw Minerve forwards, attempting to ram Dido amidships. If the attack had been successful, Dido would likely have been crushed by the weight of the larger frigate, but Towry was able to respond by throwing the wheel hard to port and turning away from the blow. The frigates were so close that Minerves <b>bowsprit</b> became tangled in the rigging of Didos mizenmast. The effect was to throw Dido hard against Minerves starboard bow and lift the smaller ship almost out of the water, her weight suspended from Minerves <b>bowsprit.</b> Covered by cannon fire from the forward 18-pounder long guns and heavy musketry, the French crew attempted to scramble along the <b>bowsprit</b> and onto Didos deck, the boarding action prevented by sailors armed with pikes. The attack was dangerous, wave action causing the suspended Dido to slam repeatedly against the hull of Minerve, and at approximately 9:00 the <b>bowsprit</b> finally snapped under the strain, fatally plunging at least eight French sailors attempting to board Dido into the gap between the ships. It also dislodged Didos mizenmast, which collapsed.|$|E
25|$|Due to the J/80 {{having an}} {{asymmetrical}} spinnaker with a retractable <b>bowsprit,</b> {{there is little}} clutter on the deck and in the cockpit, giving the crew more space and fewer tripping hazards on board.|$|E
60|$|The Gargoyles {{had backed}} away a {{distance}} {{when they heard}} the sound of talking, for although our friends had spoken in low tones their words seemed loud in the silence surrounding them. But as soon as the conversation ceased, the grinning, ugly creatures arose in a flock and flew swiftly toward the strangers, their long arms stretched out before them like the <b>bowsprits</b> of a fleet of sail-boats. The horse had especially attracted their notice, because it was the biggest and strangest creature they had ever seen; so it became the center of their first attack.|$|R

50|$|The Act of 1704 {{encouraged}} {{the import of}} naval stores form New England, offering £4 per ton of tar or pitch, £3 per ton of resin of turpentine, and £1 per ton of masts and <b>bowsprits</b> (40 cubic feet). The Act of 1705 forbade the cutting of unfenced or small pitch pine and tar trees with a diameter less than twelve inches. The Act of 1711 gave the Survey General of the King’s Forests authority over all colonies from New Jersey to Maine. Lastly, the Act of 1721 extended dominion of the King’s Forests to any trees not found within a township or its boundaries, and interestingly enough officially recognizing the American word ‘lumber’ for the first time.|$|R
