40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to identify the predictability of RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 1 regarding thermal-hydraulic behavior during a steam generator tube rupture (SGTR). To evaluate the computed results, LSTF SB-SG- 06 test data simulating the SGTR that occurred at the Mihama Unit 2 in 1991 are used. Also, some sensitivity studies of the code change in RELAP 5, the break simulation model, and the <b>break</b> <b>valve</b> discharge coefficient are performed.

However, there are some differences from the experimental data in the number of the relief valve cycling in the affected SG, and the flow regime of the hot leg with the pressurizer, and the break flow rates.

40|$|Space debris poses a {{major risk}} to spacecraft. In low earth orbit, impact {{velocities}} can be 10 11 kms and {{as high as}} 15 kms. For debris shield design, it would be desirable {{to be able to}} launch controlled shape projectiles to these velocities. The design of the proposed 10 11 kmsec gun uses, as a starting point, the Ames 1. 280. 22 two stage gun, which has achieved muzzle velocities of 10 11. 3 kmsec. That gun is scaled up to a 0. 3125 launch tube diameter. The gun is then optimized with respect to maximum pressures by varying the pump tube length to diameter ratio (LD), the piston mass and the hydrogen pressure. A pump tube LD of 36. 4 is selected giving the best overall performance. Piezometric ratios for the optimized guns are found to be 2. 3, much more favorable than for more traditional two stage light gas guns, which range from 4 to 6. The maximum powder chamber pressures are 20 to 30 ksi. To reduce maximum pressures, the desirable range of the included angle of the cone of the high pressure coupling is found to be 7. 3 to 14. 6 degrees. Lowering the <b>break</b> <b>valve</b> rupture pressure is found to lower the maximum projectile base pressure, but to raise the maximum gun pressure. For the optimized gun with a pump tube LD of 36. 4, increasing the muzzle velocity by decreasing the projectile mass and increasing the powder loads is studied.

30|$|In an {{economic}} analysis, {{it is necessary}} to compare a project with other possible alternatives. In this particular case, only an option can be compared and it consists with PRVs’ application in the WDN, since the starting point is to guarantee water pressure control and pipe leakages reduction. The total cost faced by the water management for the existing PRVs has been estimated to amount to 45, 000 € that, compared with that of PAT system (Table  2), shows how a PAT system can be easily adopted like a valid alternative. A similar choice adopted by water managers, when allowed by the hydraulic conditions, is a new way to generate and to use in the same place green energy for the EVs recharge. Moreover, a similar installation plant, similar to PRVs, leads to a reduction in the rate of <b>breaking</b> of <b>valves</b> and pipes.

This paper describes work carried out within the STARS project at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) using the U. S. NRC - sponsored sys tem code TRACE. Post - test analyses for eight selected ROSA and ROSA - 2 experiments from the OECD/NEA projects ROSA and ROSA - 2 were conducted previ ously using TRACE version 5. 0 release candidate (RC) 3. A consistent plant nodalisation is employed across all tests, which include typical design and beyond design basis accidents, such as loss - of - coolant - accident, main steam line break, and steam generator tube rupture. The full series of cases has been consolidated and upgraded for TRACE version 5. 0 Patch 4. Sin ce the newer TRACE version includes substantial changes in the area of choked flow modelling, the nodalisation of the <b>break</b> <b>valves</b> {{has proven to be a}} critical upgrade in all test cases.

The complete set of tests has been supplemented by one further post - test analysis presented herein; The OECD/NEA ROSA - 2 Test 7, a PWR 13 % cold leg intermediate break los s - of - coolant accident (IBLOCA). Results show that, for this break size, the influen ce of the uncertainty in the break flow rate is substantial. T here is a fine balance between the timing of the core uncovery and loop seal clearance, the rate of coolant loss following core uncovery, and the ability of the loop seal clearance to effectivel y quench the core.

40|$|The {{subdivision}} of {{two-phase flow}} in branching conduits {{consisting of a}} large horizontal main pipe with upward, downward, or lateral branches of reduced diameter is of great interest in various technological fields. For example, these conduits are important in light-water nuclear reactors (LWRs) {{in the case of}} a small break loss-of-coolant accident (SBLOCA) in a leg of the reactor's primary coolant loops, as well as for <b>breaks</b> or <b>valve</b> malfunctions in a large pipeline. In these kinds of circumstances, the relevant phenomenology often involves phase stratification coupled with possible liquid entrainment or gas pool-through phenomena. Therefore, these phenomena were studied in depth to evaluate the pressure drop across conduit elements resulting from the redistribution of flow phases and the discharged mass among them. In the past, several experiments have been performed along with studies in flow modelling. As a result, several formulae and models for branch exit quality and consequent discharge mass flow rate predictions have been proposed. In recent years, we have been engaged in extensive research on this subject, resulting in a new semi-empirical formulation to express branch exit quality in terms of the physical processes taking place in the conduits, the operating parameters and the branch geometry. In this paper, we applied these correlations to representative sets of experiments previously reported in the literature, comprising a wide range of branch-to-main-pipe diameter ratios and operating pressures, which proved our formulation to be very accurate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Conventional {{electro-hydraulic}} precision {{motion control}} systems {{are controlled by}} either servo valves or proportional directional control valves. Neither of the valves are {{able to control the}} pressures at the two cylinder chambers independently or to use the regeneration flow. The result is that while precision motion control is possible, significant energy saving is not. In order to save energy while maintaining excellent motion performance, the independent control of the pressures at the two cylinder chambers and the accurate use of the regeneration flow are two key factors. The programmable valves, a combination of five independently controlled poppet-type cartridge <b>valves,</b> <b>break</b> the mechanical linkage between the meter-in and meter-out orifices, maintain the full functionality of conventional four-way valves and enable the accurate control of the regeneration flow via the true cross port valve. Therefore, the programmable valves are capable of both precision motion control and significant energy saving.

One of the areas showing much potential, is CNT-Ionic-polymer based actuators for use in applications such as <b>valves,</b> <b>breaking</b> systems or even artificial muscles. At Fraunhofer IPA the development of such actuators has been a key area of research for the last ten years. The optimisation of dry actuators, their system integration and actuation multiplication has lead to many advances in this particular domain [CNT-Ionic liquid-polymer based actuators]. Up till now geometry has been a governing factor on the displacement properties of actuators. For example long thin actuators generate a larger displacement, circular provide more force and ultra thin actuators move at a much higher frequency. Furthermore the incorporation of many actuators into stacks with an aim of multiplying any given characteristic (force, displacement, speed) has also been studied. Lastly the interaction between contact electrodes and multiple actuator systems has been a governing parameter often neglected. When considering the multiple possibilities of usage once displacement, force and reaction rate has been determined, their use in future niche applications is nearly unlimited. A system which uses particularly low power of 1 W (2 V with 0. 5 A) means that this technology can be used in mobile systems as they can be easily powered by batteries, further increasing their application portfolio.

40|$|This Fission Product Transport (FPT) Phenomena Identification and Ranking Technique (PIRT) report briefly {{reviews the}} {{high-temperature}} gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) FPT mechanisms and then documents the step-by-step PIRT process for FPT. The panel examined three FPT modes of operation: (1) Normal operation which, {{for the purposes}} of the FPT PIRT, established the fission product circuit loading and distribution for the accident phase. (2) Anticipated transients which were of less importance to the panel because a break in the pressure circuit boundary is generally necessary for the release of fission products. The transients can change the fission product distribution within the circuit, however, because temperature changes, flow perturbations, and mechanical vibrations or shocks can result in fission product movement. (3) Postulated accidents drew the majority of the panel's time because a breach in the pressure boundary is necessary to release fission products to the confinement. The accidents of interest involved a vessel or pipe <b>break,</b> a safety <b>valve</b> opening with or without sticking, or leak of some kind. Two generic scenarios were selected as postulated accidents: (1) the pressurized loss-of-forced circulation (P-LOFC) accident, and (2) the depressurized loss-of-forced circulation (D-LOFC) accidents. FPT is not an accident driver; it is the result of an accident, and the PIRT was broken down into a two-part task. First, normal operation was seen as the initial starting point for the analysis. Fission products will be released by the fuel and distributed throughout the reactor circuit in some fashion. Second, a primary circuit breach can then lead to their release. It is the magnitude of the release into and out of the confinement that is of interest. Depending on the design of a confinement or containment, the impact of a pressure boundary breach can be minimized if a modest, but not excessively large, fission product attenuation factor can be introduced into the release path. This exercise has identified a host of material properties, thermofluid states, and physics models that must be collected, defined, and understood to evaluate this attenuation factor. The assembled PIRT table underwent two iterations with extensive reorganization between meetings. Generally, convergence was obtained on most issues, but different approaches to the specific physics and transport paths shade the answers accordingly. The reader should be cautioned that merely selecting phenomena based on high importance and low knowledge may not capture the true uncertainty of the situation. This is because a transport path is composed of several serial linkages, each with its own uncertainty. The propagation of a chain of modest uncertainties can lead to a very large uncertainty at the end of a long path, resulting in a situation that is of little regulatory guidance...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made in the ongoing development of the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) Plant Dynamics Code (PDC), the ongoing investigation and development of control strategies, and the analysis of system transient behavior for supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO{sub 2 }) Brayton cycles. Several code modifications have been introduced during FY 2011 to extend the range of applicability of the PDC and to improve its calculational stability and speed. A new and innovative approach was developed to couple the Plant Dynamics Code for S-CO{sub 2 } cycle calculations with SAS 4 A/SASSYS- 1 Liquid Metal Reactor Code System calculations for the transient system level behavior on the reactor side of a Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) or Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor (LFR). The new code system allows use of the full capabilities of both codes such that whole-plant transients can now be simulated without additional user interaction. Several other code modifications, including the introduction of compressor surge control, a new approach for determining the solution time step for efficient computational speed, an updated treatment of S-CO{sub 2 } cycle flow mergers and splits, a modified enthalpy equation to improve the treatment of negative flow, and a revised solution of the reactor heat exchanger (RHX) equations coupling the S-CO{sub 2 } cycle to the reactor, were introduced to the PDC in FY 2011. All of these modifications have improved the code computational stability and computational speed, while not significantly affecting the results of transient calculations. The improved PDC was used to continue the investigation of S-CO{sub 2 } cycle control and transient behavior. The coupled PDC-SAS 4 A/SASSYS- 1 code capability was used to study the dynamic characteristics of a S-CO{sub 2 } cycle coupled to a SFR plant. Cycle control was investigated in terms of the ability of the cycle to respond to a linear reduction in the electrical grid demand from 100 % to 0 % at a rate of 5 %/minute. It was determined that utilization of turbine throttling control below 50 % load improves the cycle efficiency significantly. Consequently, the cycle control strategy has been updated to include turbine throttle valve control. The new control strategy still relies on inventory control in the 50 %- 90 % load range and turbine bypass for fine and fast generator output adjustments, but it now also includes turbine throttling control in the 0 %- 50 % load range. In an attempt to investigate the feasibility of using the S-CO{sub 2 } cycle for normal decay heat removal from the reactor, the cycle control study was extended beyond the investigation of normal load following. It was shown that such operation is possible with the extension of the inventory and the turbine throttling controls. However, the cycle operation in this range is calculated to be so inefficient that energy would need to be supplied from the electrical grid assuming that the generator could be capable of being operated in a motoring mode with an input electrical energy from the grid having a magnitude of about 20 % of the nominal plant output electrical power level in order to maintain circulation of the CO{sub 2 } in the cycle. The work on investigation of cycle operation at low power level will be continued in the future. In addition to the cycle control study, the coupled PDC-SAS 4 A/SASSYS- 1 code system was also used to simulate thermal transients in the sodium-to-CO{sub 2 } heat exchanger. Several possible conditions with the potential to introduce significant changes to the heat exchanger temperatures were identified and simulated. The conditions range from reactor scram and primary sodium pump failure or intermediate sodium pump failure on the reactor side to pipe <b>breaks</b> and <b>valve</b> malfunctions on the S-CO{sub 2 } side. It was found that the maximum possible rate of the heat exchanger wall temperature change for the particular heat exchanger design assumed is limited to {+-} 7 C/s for less than 10 seconds. Modeling in the Plant Dynamics Code has been compared with available data from the Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) small-scale S-CO{sub 2 } Brayton cycle demonstration that is being assembled in a phased approach currently at Barber-Nichols Inc. and at SNL in the future. The available data was obtained with an earlier configuration of the S-CO{sub 2 } loop involving only a single-turbo-alternator-compressor (TAC) instead of two TACs, a single low temperature recuperator (LTR) instead of both a LTR and a high temperature recuperator (HTR), and fewer than the later to be installed full set of electric heaters. Due to the absence of the full heating capability as well as the lack of a high temperature recuperator providing additional recuperation, the temperature conditions obtained with the loop are too low for the loop conditions to be prototypical of the S-CO{sub 2 } cycle...|$|R
