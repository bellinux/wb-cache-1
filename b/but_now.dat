5|$|At {{first it}} always bothers you {{even though you}} say it doesn't. But I think {{if you want to}} exceed limits, you have to suck that all in and be happy with what you have. At first it was painful to watch all those things <b>but</b> <b>now</b> I take it as {{constructive}} criticism or I don't bother to look at it.|$|E

5|$|Black Creek is an ephemeral stream. It used {{to drain}} an area between Turtle Creek and the Susquehanna River, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> loses its flow to {{underground}} mines via broken bedrock. Its channel is also disrupted by strip mines and rock piles. The waters of Black Creek are acidic.|$|E
5|$|<b>But</b> <b>now</b> my {{attitude}} {{is getting to}} be a little different, I think. Now my concern is mostly to find out what there is in common... Autumn was written after November Steps. I really wanted to do something which I hadn't done in November Steps, not to blend the instruments, but to integrate them.|$|E
5|$|<b>But</b> <b>now,</b> I {{no longer}} pleaded for anything. I {{was no longer}} able to lament. On the contrary, I felt very strong. I was the accuser, God the accused. My eyes had opened and I was alone, terribly alone in a world without God, without man. Without love or mercy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{radio station}} WTTN, AM 1580, was {{licensed}} to Watertown <b>but</b> is <b>now</b> licensed to with the transmitter located west of Columbus, Wisconsin while the studio {{was moved to}} Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.

25|$|The forced {{interaction}} with other peoples with technology {{has caused a}} lot of changes in the lifestyle of the Toda.

5|$|By the 18th century, the Royal Audiencia of Quito {{began to}} have {{economic}} problems; a lack of roads led to limited communications. Obrajes—a type of textile factory—had provided jobs, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> found themselves in decline, mainly due to a crackdown on smuggled European cloths {{and a series of}} natural disasters. Obrajes were replaced by haciendas, and the dominant groups continued to exploit the indigenous population.|$|E
5|$|Employed at Square Enix from 1998 to 2003, Eguchi is {{currently}} working for Sega, where he primarily assists Tomoya Ohtani on his projects.

5|$|Folk-stories told in {{the nineteenth}} century about elves are still told in modern Denmark and Sweden, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> feature ethnic {{minorities}} in place of elves in an essentially racist discourse. In an ethnically fairly homogeneous medieval countryside, supernatural beings provided the Other through which everyday people created their identities; in cosmopolitan industrial contexts, ethnic minorities or immigrants are used in storytelling to similar effect.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Mouton co-founded the {{international}} motorsport event Race of Champions with Fredrik Johnsson, {{in memory of}} Toivonen and to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the world championship for rally drivers.

5|$|In March 1923, Richardson was {{appointed}} Administrator of Western Samoa, a former possession of Imperial Germany <b>but</b> <b>now</b> {{a mandate for}} which New Zealand was responsible {{on behalf of the}} League of Nations.

50|$|Two {{additional}} species, {{the rock}} earthcreeper and the straight-billed earthcreeper, were formerly placed in this genus, <b>but</b> have <b>now</b> {{been moved to}} Ochetorhynchus.

50|$|This {{species was}} for years erroneously called Quercus nuttallii, <b>but</b> it is <b>now</b> known as Quercus texana; this has created much {{confusion}} with Texas red oak which {{was known as}} Quercus texana <b>but</b> is <b>now</b> known as Quercus buckleyi.|$|R

5|$|Initially trains {{were made}} up of eight carriages, but after 1879 nine became the standard. At the end of 1905 the District {{replaced}} 395 carriages with electric multiple units.

5|$|Initially, it was {{suggested}} that tolling would cease once the original cost of construction plus accrued interest was repaid – this was done in 1993 and it was planned that tolls would not be levied after May 1995. Instead legislation enabling the continued levying of tolls was renewed by Parliament (originally that of the UK <b>but</b> <b>now</b> the Scottish Parliament) in 1998, 2003 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the broad-billed parrot may have depended on dodos and Cylindraspis tortoises to eat palm fruits and excrete their seeds, which became food for the parrots. Anodorhynchus macaws depended on now-extinct South American megafauna in the same way, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> rely on domesticated cattle for this service.|$|E
