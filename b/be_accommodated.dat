5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} {{the book for}} public educators as {{an important contribution to}} liberal theory. Their common criticism was based around practical applications and the imposition of autonomy as a value, e.g., her contemporary examples of national civics education, how citizens who disagreed with the focus on autonomy could <b>be</b> <b>accommodated,</b> and how a weak perfectionist state could defend marginalized group interests in a public school setting.|$|E

5|$|Coffin died on September 16, 1877 {{at around}} 2:30p.m. {{at his home}} in Avondale, Ohio. His funeral was held at the Friends Meeting House of Cincinnati. The Cincinnati Daily Gazette {{reported}} that the crowd was too large to <b>be</b> <b>accommodated</b> indoors; hundreds had to remain outside. Four of Coffin's eight pallbearers were free blacks who had worked with him on the Underground Railroad. Coffin was interred in Cincinnati's Spring Grove Cemetery in an unmarked grave. Coffin's wife, Catharine, who died four years later on May 22, 1881, is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery as well.|$|E
5|$|Enormous crowds could <b>be</b> <b>accommodated</b> at Spring Gardens, Vauxhall. In 1749 a {{rehearsal}} of Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks attracted {{an audience of}} 12,000, and in 1786 a fancy-dress jubilee to celebrate the proprietor's long ownership was thronged with 61,000 revellers. Many {{of the best known}} musicians and singers of the day performed at the Gardens, for example Sophia Baddeley. In 1732, their fashionable status was confirmed by a fancy dress ball attended by Frederick, Prince of Wales. At that time access from the West End was by water, but the opening of Westminster Bridge in the 1740s made access easier though less charming.|$|E

5|$|The idea of deporting Polish Jews to Madagascar was {{investigated}} by the Polish government in 1937, but the task force sent to evaluate the island's potential determined that only 5,000 to 7,000 families could <b>be</b> <b>accommodated,</b> or even as few as 500 families by some estimates. Because efforts by the Nazis to encourage the emigration of the Jewish population of Germany before World War II were only partially successful, the idea of deporting Jews to Madagascar was revived by the Nazi government in 1940.|$|E

5|$|During April 1940, No. 607 Squadron RAF {{was based}} at Saint-Inglevert, flying Gloster Gladiator Mk II HR aircraft.

The following day, the order came to evacuate to Boos airfield, Rouen, Normandy, but only four of the ten aircraft that departed from Saint-Inglevert arrived safely at Boos. All aircraft carried as many passengers as could <b>be</b> <b>accommodated.</b> Two Potez 63-11's and a Bloch MB.152 were abandoned at Saint-Inglevert, and were destroyed to prevent their use by the enemy, as were supplies of fuel.

5|$|On 3 or 4January 1644, {{the five}} leading dissenting brethren signalled {{a break with}} the rest of the Assembly when they {{published}} An Apologeticall Narration, a polemical pamphlet appealing to Parliament. It argued that the congregational system was more amenable to state control of religious matters than that of the presbyterians because they did not desire the church to retain any real power except to withdraw fellowship from aberrant congregations. By 17January, the majority of the Assembly had become convinced that the best way forward was a presbyterian system similar to that of the Scots, but the dissenting brethren were allowed to continue to state their case in hope that they could eventually be reconciled. It was hoped that by avoiding asserting that presbyterianism was established by divine right, the congregationalists could <b>be</b> <b>accommodated.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Comet 4 was {{a further}} {{improvement}} on the stretched Comet 3 with even greater fuel capacity. The design had progressed {{significantly from the}} original Comet 1, growing by 18ft 6in (5.64m) and typically seating 74 to 81 passengers compared to the Comet 1's 36 to 44 (119 passengers could <b>be</b> <b>accommodated</b> in a special charter seating package in the later 4C series). The Comet 4 was considered the definitive series, having a longer range, higher cruising speed and higher maximum takeoff weight. These improvements were possible largely because of Avon engines with twice {{the thrust of the}} Comet 1's Ghosts. Deliveries to BOAC began on 30 September 1958 with two 48-seat aircraft, which were used to initiate the first scheduled transatlantic services.|$|E
5|$|With Hitler's approval, Himmler {{intended}} {{that the}} new society of the Nazi regime should destigmatise illegitimate births, particularly of children fathered {{by members of the}} SS, who were vetted for racial purity. His hope was that each SS family would have between four and six children. The Lebensborn (Fountain of Life) association, founded by Himmler in 1935, created a series of maternity homes where single mothers could <b>be</b> <b>accommodated</b> during their pregnancies. Both parents were examined for racial suitability before acceptance. The resulting children were often adopted into SS families. The homes were also made available to the wives of SS and NSDAP members, who quickly filled over half the available spots.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s and early 1900s {{there were a}} number of {{resettlement}} plans for European Jews that were precursors to the Madagascar Plan. Paul de Lagarde, an Orientalist scholar, first suggested evacuating the European Jews to Madagascar in his 1878 work Deutsche Schriften ("German Writings"). Members of the Zionist movement in 1904–1905 seriously debated the British Uganda Programme, by which Russian Jews, who were in immediate danger from ongoing pogroms, would be settled in what today is Kenya. The plan was later rejected as unworkable by the Zionist Congress. Adherents of territorialism split off from the main Zionist movement and continued to search for a location where Jews might settle and create a state, or at least an autonomous area. The idea of Jewish resettlement in Madagascar was promoted by British antisemites Henry Hamilton Beamish, Arnold Leese, and others. With the cooperation of the French, the Polish government commissioned a task force in 1937 to examine the possibility of deporting Polish Jews to the island. The head of the commission, , felt the island could accommodate 5,000 to 7,000 families, but Jewish members of the group estimated that only 500 or even fewer families could safely <b>be</b> <b>accommodated.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault introduced diffuser designs similar to the Red Bull RB6. Ferrari's design largely changed the shape of their exhaust system, and introduced a new gearbox case for Massa's car to raise the pick-up points of its rear suspension to help him adjust to the changes. They constructed a larger radiator to deal with the additional heat. Mercedes elected not to bring a new gearbox casing, but introduced a new rear diffuser to fully utilise the air blowing from the car's exhaust. Renault's design had the exit of their car's exhaust which had thermal protection against high temperatures and the team introduced a new design of their gearbox casing to allow for the pick-up points for its rear suspension to <b>be</b> <b>accommodated.</b> After running the F-duct device (which increases a car's top speed) in Friday practice, Red Bull decided to use it {{for the remainder of the}} weekend.|$|E
5|$|The Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601 formalized earlier {{practices}} of poor relief {{contained in the}} Act for the Relief of the Poor 1597 yet is often cited {{as the beginning of}} the Old Poor Law system. It created a system administered at parish level, paid for by levying local rates on rate payers. Relief for those too ill or old to work, the so-called 'impotent poor', was {{in the form of a}} payment or items of food ('the parish loaf') or clothing also known as outdoor relief. Some aged people might <b>be</b> <b>accommodated</b> in parish alms houses, though these were usually private charitable institutions. Meanwhile, able-bodied beggars who had refused work were often placed in Houses of Correction or even subjected to beatings to mend their attitudes. Provision for the many able-bodied poor in the workhouse, was relatively unusual, and most workhouses developed later. The 1601 Law said that parents and children were responsible for each other, elderly parents would live with their children.|$|E
