The Teaching Behavior Questionnaire (TBQ), the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ), and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children (PANAS-C) were completed by 777 third to fifth graders in nine elementary schools. Using two-level hierarchical linear model analyses, we found that (a) perceived instructional teaching <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> negatively associated with NA and positively associated with PA; (b) perceived organizational <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> not associated with either; (c) perceived socio-emotional teaching <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> positively associated with both; (d) perceived negative teaching <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> positively associated with NA but not associated with PA.

5|$|The {{individual}} animals need {{to express}} survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking food, water, shelter, and a mate. The motivational {{system in the}} brain monitors {{the current state of}} satisfaction of these goals, and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise. The motivational system works largely by a reward–punishment mechanism. When a particular <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> followed by favorable consequences, the reward mechanism in the brain is activated, which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same behavior to be repeated later, whenever a similar situation arises. Conversely, when a <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> followed by unfavorable consequences, the brain's punishment mechanism is activated, inducing structural changes that cause the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future.|$|E
40|$|For the {{official}} publication, see: [URL] {{research has shown}} that physical activity and sedentary <b>behavior</b> <b>are</b> related to learning performance in traditional education. In distance education (DE), however, students are characterized by different features (e. g., age and responsibilities). As a result, DE students often have full schedules andmust make choices that traditional students do not. Advice on <b>behavior</b> change <b>is</b> low-cost and easy to implement. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate whether physical activity and sedentary <b>behavior</b> <b>are</b> related to learning performance in DE. In an observational longitudinal study, physical activity and sedentary behavior of 1100 adult DE students were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. Students provided information on physical activity, sedentary behavior and important covariates at the start of their study. Learning performance,measured as study progress,was evaluated after 14 months (i. e., the number of successfully completed modules). Analyses revealed that only sedentary <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> a significant predictor for study progress. More sedentary <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> predictive for more learning performance in adults participating in DE. Despite these findings, it is not recommended that students should be more sedentary as health/cognitive benefits following from more physical activity and less sedentary <b>behavior</b> <b>are</b> proven. Instead, future research should focus on which specific sedentary <b>behaviors</b> <b>are</b> responsible for this relation as sedentary <b>behaviors</b> may <b>be</b> differentially associated with learning performance...|$|R

5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time {{to care for the}} nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E
40|$|Several factors {{thought to}} {{influence}} the representativeness of behavioral assessment data were examined in an analogue study using a multifactorial design. Systematic and unsystematic methods of observing group <b>behavior</b> <b>were</b> investigated using 18 male and 18 female observers. Additionally, valence properties of the observed <b>behaviors</b> <b>were</b> inspected. Observers' assessments of a videotape were compared to a criterion code that defined the population of behaviors. Results indicated that systematic observation procedures were more accurate than unsystematic procedures, though this factor interacted with gender of observer and valence of behavior. Additionally, males tended to sample more representatively than females. A third finding indicated that the negatively valenced <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> overestimated, whereas the neutral and positively valenced <b>behaviors</b> <b>were</b> accurately assessed...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of instructions and feedback from an experimenter on observational recordings of disruptive <b>behavior</b> <b>was</b> evaluated. Four subject-observers recorded four categories of disruptive behavior from videotapes {{of children in}} a classroom setting. Two sets of videotapes, labelled “baseline” and “treatment”, were matched for rates of disruptive behavior in each category. The observers were told that two target <b>behaviors</b> <b>were</b> expected to decrease {{and the other two}} control <b>behaviors</b> <b>were</b> not expected to change during the treatment condition. During observational recording of treatment videotapes, the observers were given positive feedback when they reported decreases in the two target behaviors, and negative feedback when they reported either to change or increases in the two control behaviors. The target <b>behaviors</b> <b>were</b> recorded less frequently by observers, while recordings of control <b>behaviors</b> <b>were</b> unaffected during the treatment phase. These results suggest that contingent feedback to observers should be avoided as a possible source of bias in behavioral recordings...|$|R

5|$|Although usually trivalent, {{ytterbium}} readily forms divalent compounds. This <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> {{unusual for}} lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 {{state has a}} valence electron configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion {{is a very strong}} reducing agent and decomposes water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in aqueous solution. Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the +2 state, but europium(II) is stable in aqueous solution. Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels in Canada and the {{northern}} United States typically migrate south in the winter, sometimes going as far as Central America and the Caribbean. Birds that breed south of about 35° north latitude are usually year-round residents. Migration also depends on local weather conditions. Wintering kestrels' choice of habitat varies by sex. Females are found in open areas more often than males during the non-breeding season. A common explanation for this <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> that the larger females arrive at the preferred habitat first and exclude males from their territory.|$|E
