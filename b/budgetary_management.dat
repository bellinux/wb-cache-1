The results obtained from the survey show that managers of most budgetary users consider that information presented in external financial statements are generally sufficient for decision making and successful management. Furthermore, the research results indicate that public managers are only partially familiar with the cost accounting and management accounting instruments. The information offered in the internal financial statements are not exploited enough in the pricing of services, performance measurement and the performance monitoring of service provision...|$|R
