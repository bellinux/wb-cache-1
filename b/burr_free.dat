40|$|AbstractTo obtain {{high quality}} results in laser fusion cutting, generally, {{a time and}} cost {{intensive}} optimization process has to be run. We report on a fast algorithm to optimize the laser parameters to get a <b>burr</b> <b>free</b> laser cut. The algorithm includes design of experiments and one-factor-at-a-time methods. The algorithm describes the whole optimization from the first to the optimum cut. Using a 500 W singe mode fiber laser we have optimized laser cutting of 1 mm aluminum. As a comparative study we used a 1 kW multi mode fiber laser. Our results demonstrate {{the potential of the}} optimization algorithm...|$|E

It {{is suggested that}} the use of a magnetic bearing spindle can not only successfully provide the beneflts of high speed machining but, more importantly, minimize tool path errors. In this paper the various sources of tool path errors are discussed as functions of machine tool positioning errors and cutting force errors which are characterized as static, dynamic and stochastic. The operation of high speed magnetic bearing spindles is described and a control scheme whereby the spindle may be translated and tilted for minimizing tool path errors is discussed. This overall research activity is a cooperative effort between The University of Maryland, Cincinnati Milacron, and The National Bureau of Standards...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Photochemical {{machining}} (PCM) {{is one of}} the non-conventional {{machining processes}} that produce <b>burr</b> <b>free</b> & stress free flat complex metal components. In the present work optimization of process parameters for Photochemical machining of Inconel 600 by using response surface methodology. Mathematical models have been developed to study the effect of input parameters on Undercut from the results of the experiments. The predictive models ’ analyses were supported with the aid of the statistical software package-Design Expert (DE 9). The different input parameters such as etching time, etchant concentration and etchant temperature were set during the photochemical machining. Design of Experiment was done by Face centered composite design method by having 20 experiments to see the effect on etching of Inconel 600. Minimum Undercut was observed at the etching temperature 55. 276 0 C, etchant concentration 470. 781 gm/lit and 55. 276 min etching time. The optimum material undercut was found 0. 0029 mm...|$|E
40|$|Steel {{manufacturers}} and stockholders prefer bandsawing for cutting off raw materials {{compared to other}} techniques as it enjoys competitive advantages of higher accuracy of cut, better surface finish, lower kerf loss, better straightness of cut, long tool life and high metal removal rate. Along with the geometries of the bandsaw tooth, bandsaw cutting edge condition (e. g., edge sharpness and burr) significantly affects the cutting performance of a bandsaw. Currently the production of bandsaw is largely done by milling operation due to the scale of manufacturing and the economics of milling compared to other processes (e. g., grinding). Ideally, the bandsaw teeth should possess sharp cutting edges with no burr. In general, two types of burr are commonly seen in the bandsaw teeth manufactured by milling operation namely tooth tip burr and side burr. Current research undertaken at Northumbria University in collaboration with a major bandsaw producer {{is focused on the}} mechanism of burr formation in the bandsaw teeth. This paper briefly outlines the factors affecting the burr formation in bimetal (High Speed Steel edge wire and soft steel backing material) bandsaw teeth manufactured by milling process and suggests the necessary steps to be considered for manufacturing <b>burr</b> <b>free</b> bandsaw with sharp cutting edges. The investigation showed that flank wear in the milling cutter has a major influence on the side burr formation in the bandsaw teeth, whereas tooth tip burr was influenced by both flank wear and ''V'' type notch wear found at the crossover point on the flank face. It was also concluded that TiN coating on the milling cutter could control the burr formation in bandsaw teeth to some degree...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} optics with {{increasing}} quality for more efficient illumination systems {{lead to the}} development of more complex optical elements. Refractive optics can be combined with diffractive microstructures to hybrid lenses, which can be produced cost-effective by ultra precision machining using diamond cutting tools. However this machining technique has to be adapted regarding machine and process properties to the requirements of micro structuring free-form surfaces. Thus this paper will discuss {{the development of a new}} Hybrid-FTS for the manufacturing of hybrid optics and the needs regarding process technology to ensure high quality microstructures. The Hybrid-FTS combines two axes with different strokes and dynamic properties into a single system to be able to machine hybrid optics. A piezo driven FTS with a bandwidth of 2 kHz and a maximum stroke of 30 mym will be integrated into a dynamic axis having 20 mm travel. The dynamic axis, which is designed like a sleeve, will be equipped with hydrostatic bearings offering good stiffness and damping properties. Due to the stroke of several millimetres a linear scale is used as measurement system. A linear motor drives the slide. In that way working frequency of 20 Hz at 5 mm stroke shall be realised. The presented concept of a Hybrid-FTS will allow the machining of micro structures on free-form surfaces. The special design of the tool guiding system in the FTS realises a high bandwidth of 2 kHz. Due to an effective mass compensation system in the FTS the direct integration into the dynamic axis is enabled. The machining of microstructures requires matched material and process characteristics to achieve <b>burr</b> <b>free</b> groove edges. Nickel-Phosphorous coatings seem to be very suitable for the machining of microstructures due to their homogenous composition. Furthermore the structure geometry influences the burr generation strongly...|$|E
40|$|Angioplasty {{over the}} years has proven to be an {{excellent}} substitute for open heart surgery where an artery/vien, blocked by atherosclerosis, is expanded using a stent. Metallic and coated metallic stents have been used for angioplasty. Metal stents might induce blood clotting, release cytotoxic heavy metal ions which are potential inducers of allergies, clotting, immune reactions and hyperproliferation of smooth muscle cells and also lead to protein absorption which activates clotting factors. Biodegradable polymers have also been tried as stent materials, but the loss of radial strength over time is a big problem associated with them. The use of a hybrid stent, consisting of biodegradable polymer and biocompatible stainless steel, is proposed. The use of such a system would require excellent adhesion between the stent metal and the biodegradable polymer. This study presents the electrochemically induced micromechanical interlocking to enhance adhesion between 304 stainless steel and high density polyethylene. High density polyethylene was used instead of biodegradable polymer for initial investigation. Electrochemical etching on the stainless steel wire was accomplished by immersing a stainless steel wire in a sodium carbonate electrolyte while applying a known voltage through the wire. The electrochemical etching of the stainless steel wire resulted in pitting under suitable conditions. The etching time, voltage and electrolyte concentration were varied to achieve different pit sizes and pit distributions on the stainless steel wire. An image analysis was conducted using an image analysis software to find the exact pit size and pit distribution on the stainless steel wire from electrochemical etching. A statistical model based on design of engineering experiments was derived. Etched and the unetched wires were molded with high density polyethylene and a mechanical test was conducted to measure the force required to pull the wire out of the polymer and verified using calculations based on the pit size and pit distribution of the pits {{on the surface of the}} wire. Electrochemical etching produced <b>burr</b> <b>free</b> surface features. It was observed that the pH level in the electrolyte contributes to the pit size and pit distribution. The results of the statistical model were consistent with the experimental values and it was possible to optimize the electrochemical etching parameters for maximum pit size and pit distribution. It was also observed that while voltage and etching time contribute to pit size and pit distribution, the electrolyte concentration does not have significant effect on the pit size and pit distribution. The calculated pull out force and measured values were off by 22. 7 %. The lower value of calculated force could result from neglecting some of the smaller pits while performing the image analysis. The average adhesive strength of the etched samples was 276 % higher than that of the unetched samples...|$|E
