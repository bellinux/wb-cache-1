5|$|Han van Meegeren {{knew that}} white lead was used during Vermeer’s time, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> had to obtain his stocks through the modern colour trade, which had changed {{significantly}} since the 17th century. During Vermeer’s time, Dutch lead was mined from deposits {{located in the}} Low Countries; however, by the 19th century, most lead was imported from Australia and the Americas, and differed from the white lead that Vermeer would have used both in the isotope composition of the lead and {{in the content of}} trace elements found in the ores. Dutch white lead was extracted from ores containing high levels of trace elements of silver and antimony, while the modern white lead used by Van Meegeren contained neither silver nor antimony, as those elements are separated from the lead during the modern smelting process.|$|E
500|$|Two {{months after}} the airing of the fourth season finale episode, co-showrunner and {{executive}} producer Robert Carlock was asked if Jack McBrayer's character Kenneth Parcell would return in the upcoming season after he was fired as an NBC page in [...] "I Do Do". Carlock said [...] "We haven't cracked [...] he is getting [...] back, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> will get back somehow. We wanted a fun thing to shuffle the deck {{a little bit and}} send him off into the world. Of course, he will miss it and he will be missed. Events will bring him back." [...] In [...] "The Fabian Strategy", Kenneth is now working at CBS as a page for the Late Show with David Letterman. The scene in which Kenneth throws himself in front of a car to prove to Tracy Jordan that he is real and not Tracy's imagination was filmed on August 27, 2010, in front of the Ed Sullivan Theater.|$|E
2500|$|The anti-democratic {{idea was}} {{reinforced}} by Plato in The Republic, where Plato advocated rule by elite, enlightened [...] "Philosopher-Kings". The totalitarian Thirty Tyrants had anointed themselves as the elite, and {{in the minds of}} his Athenian accusers, Socrates was guilty because he was suspected of introducing oligarchic ideas to them. Larry Gonick, in his [...] "Cartoon History of the Universe" [...] writes, [...] "The trial of Socrates has always seemed mysterious...the charges sound vague and unreal...because behind the stated charges was Socrates real crime: preaching a philosophy that produced Alcibiades and Critias... <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> couldn't be prosecuted for that under the amnesty(which had been declared after the overthrow of the Thirty Tyrants)... so his accusers made it [...] "not believing the Gods of the city, introducing new Gods, and corrupting the youth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He’s a reg’lar old sea-dog," [...] said Mr. Burton. [...] "He’s {{staying with}} me, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>’e</b> don’t want it known who he is. I couldn’t refuse to ’ave {{a drink with}} ’im. I was under orders, so to speak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's a reg'lar old sea-dog," [...] said Mr. Burton. [...] "He's {{staying with}} me, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>'e</b> don't want it known who he is. I couldn't refuse to 'ave {{a drink with}} 'im. I was under orders, so to speak." ...|$|R
60|$|BLY. This Mr March--he's {{like all}} these novel-writers--thinks 'e knows 'uman nature, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>'e</b> don't. Still, I {{can talk to}} 'im--got an open mind, and hates the Gover'ment. That's the two great things. Mrs March, so far as I see, 'as got her head screwed on much tighter.|$|R
2500|$|... "Just imagine Mayor Emanuel had {{released}} the video in, say, November —without {{being forced to}} by a lawsuit.... <b>But</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> didn't do the right thing. He buried the video. He allowed officials to mislead the public. He hid the tapes because most likely he [...] assumed it would hurt his reelection campaign. Thus he {{not only did the}} immoral thing, he did the politically stupid thing. Cook County state's attorney Anita Alvarez probably would've quickly responded with an indictment—just like she did earlier this week, when the tape actually was released. I mean, it's really hard to look at that tape and not call for an indictment. If the mayor had done that, he wouldn't be the villain in this sordid story. He'd be the hero. Or at least the guy who finally, for once in his life, did the right thing." ...|$|E
60|$|I explained, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> had {{discounted}} {{and damaged}} my explanation.|$|E
6000|$|... “He {{means to}} take charge of the Canadian mill; <b>but,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> may have a number of reasons for doing so,” Ruth added hastily.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{he keeps}} fairly bobbish for his age, sir; <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he's</b> a {{wonderful}} man. As I said to Mrs. Dartie {{when she was}} here last: It would please Miss Forsyte and Mrs. Juley and Miss Hester {{to see how he}} relishes a baked apple still. But he's quite deaf. And a mercy, I always think. For what we should have done with him in the air-raids, I don't know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Hector used to come, rain, snow, or fine. <b>But,</b> then, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> was a sailor. It {{was nothing}} to him. I hope that Raffles is not ill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{sputters}} and clicks and bows. He has all {{the correct}} motions, you know; <b>but,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> when <b>he's</b> your prisoner you can't tell him what he really is." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{know why}} he is staring at Alice, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> is too gallant a gentleman to tell. Besides his astonishment has dazed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "It wasn't necessary, Sir Thomas, was it? There he is,--ready {{to marry}} her to-morrow. <b>But,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> is a little anxious about the money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Charlie {{is riding}} his own horse," [...] Lady Grace answered. [...] "He hasn't {{the ghost of}} a chance, <b>but,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> won't give it up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} they're like at that age," [...] he remarked. [...] "He was at Harrow, but he shied at college, {{and there was}} no one to insist upon his going. The pair of them had only a firm of lawyers for guardians. He's just a good-looking, clean-minded, high-spirited young fellow, full of beans, and needing the bit every now and then. <b>But,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he's</b> no {{different}} from the run of young fellows of his age, and if an adventure came his way I suppose he'd see it through." ...|$|R
60|$|They didn't let him {{learn their}} law, Or {{make a note}} of what he saw, Or {{interesting}} mem.: The lady-fish he couldn't find, <b>But</b> that, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> didn't mind-- He didn't come for them.|$|R
60|$|MRS. JONES. [Softly as throughout.] Well, he {{was very}} bad last night; {{he did n't seem}} to know what he was about. He was very late, and he was most abusive. <b>But</b> now, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he's</b> asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I met him {{years ago}} at Aaron Poole's home. <b>But</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> was {{in his right mind}} then. Poor chap! I pity him very much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oah no. Not that I know, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> found a letter-writer who {{can write}} English verree well, {{and so he}} wrote. I do hope you understand.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} that the fleet has missed me as yet," [...] I said, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> did not grasp my meaning, and only looked puzzled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Kenwardine. [...] "I don't {{want you}} to do {{anything}} that's repugnant; <b>but,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> if <b>he</b> comes to see me, I can't send him off. It isn't a matter of much importance, anyhow." ...|$|R
60|$|Douglas Stone hesitated. To refund that {{hundred pounds}} was no {{pleasant}} matter. <b>But</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> if <b>he</b> left the case he must return the money. And if the Turk were {{right and the}} woman died, his position before a coroner might be an embarrassing one.|$|R
6000|$|... "Guardy, {{you were}} my dear Philip's father, weren't you? I've never said anything; <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> you were. <b>He</b> was so like you, and so is Jock." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{took her}} {{portrait}} from the mantelpiece {{and handed it}} me. It seemed to me {{the face of a}} hard, narrow woman, <b>but,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> raved about her.|$|E
60|$|<b>But,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> couldn't understand. Humans {{were denied}} {{the speech of}} animals. The only common ground of {{communication}} upon which dogs and men can get together is in fiction.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I thank you, no. I merely {{called to}} inquire outside whether my dilatory friend {{had been so}} false to himself as to be {{practical}} and sensible. <b>But,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> has done nothing. I gave him your papers with my own hand, and he was hot upon the intention, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> has done nothing. Apart from the general human disinclination {{to do anything that}} ought to be done, I dare say there is a specially about assuring one's life. You find it like will-making. People are so superstitious, and take it for granted they will die soon afterwards.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Powell told Hugh Massingberd that [...] "I {{only knew}} the Papal Bun for nine weeks, but he {{certainly}} made an impression. I've never met anyone so materialistic in outlook. <b>But</b> then, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> wasn't at school being Powell's shorthand for Eton with me so he was only partly the inspiration for Widmerpool. Fiction isn't as straightforward as that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He said {{he thought}} he would go back to New York first," [...] said one of the stable men, [...] "and then {{he thought he would}} go on to Chicago and after that visit some of his old places and cronies in Denver. <b>But,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> where <b>he</b> really did go to I haven't the least idea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{that would}} be very nice; but Luke would never be a clergyman. He {{was going to be an}} attorney, but he didn't like that at all. He says there's a great deal of poetry in brewing beer, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he's</b> only quizzing us. Oh, here's my partner. I do so hope I shall see you very often while I'm at Baslehurst." [...] Then Rachel was alone, but Mrs. Tappitt came up to her in a minute. [...] "My dear," [...] said she, [...] "Mr. Griggs desires the honour of your hand for a quadrille." [...] And thus Rachel found herself {{standing}} up with the odious Mr. Griggs. [...] "I do so pity you," [...] said Cherry, coming behind her for a moment. [...] "Remember, you need not do it more than once. I don't mean to do it again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No; {{that was}} about the money, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> sent it back. He ran away when he was dismissed, because he was quite in despair, {{and did not know}} what he was about.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't understand, exactly," [...] March began; <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> {{understood}} that Dryfoos was offering {{to let him}} have 'Every Other Week' on some terms or other, and his heart leaped with hope.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} that he got away in time to do so, father; <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> might have gone by the down train, which passes through Gloucester somewhere about the same time." ...|$|E
60|$|However, we lads {{have not}} had good success in baking this last dish, because of the ashes which fly out of the fire when the wind blows ever so slightly. Captain Smith {{declares}} that he would rather have the ashes without the meal and sweet potato, if indeed he must eat any, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> when <b>he</b> speaks thus, {{it is only in}} the way of making sport.|$|R
6000|$|... "He thinks not, Sir Henry, {{at least}} not in a single combat, for by his {{accounts}} his horse is as nimble as himself; <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> in charges <b>he</b> and his horse would be rolled over, as you say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Though we {{have not}} seen each other for so long, I am sure you will forgive my writing. It would give us so much {{pleasure}} if you and the two children would come over for a night or two while Felix and his young folk are staying with us. It is no use, I fear, to ask Tod; <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> if <b>he</b> would come, too, both Stanley and myself would be delighted.|$|R
