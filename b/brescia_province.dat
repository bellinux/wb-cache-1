His mastery was soon contested by the Visconti of Milan, but not even their rule was undisputed, as Pandolfo III Malatesta in 1406 took possession of the city. However, in 1416 he bartered it to Filippo Maria Visconti duke of Milan, who in 1426 sold it to the Venetians. The Milanese nobles forced Filippo to resume hostilities against the Venetians, and thus to attempt the recovery of Brescia, but he was defeated {{in the battle of}} Maclodio (1427), near Brescia, by general Carmagnola, commander of the Venetian mercenary army. In 1439 Brescia was once more besieged by Francesco Sforza, captain of the Venetians, who defeated Niccolò Piccinino, Filippo's condottiero.

40|$|Which are the {{architectural}} signs that make recognizable the skylines {{of the ancient}} cities, conferring them recognizable elements in comparison to with the different profiles of the contemporary settlements? Both towers and bell tower certainly represent meaningful signs but the large number and their becoming thicken give little reference points for orientation: if all the churches are endowed with bell tower and many smaller historical centers also {{have at least a}} tower, really the frequency of this vertical sign makes it meaningless as symbol of identity of the community or as signal of orientation. The dome instead, for its lesser use (at least in the western architecture), becomes an element of certain identification. This is confirmed by its dimensional accentuation, that turns it into an "out of scale" sign, in comparison with the urban context, with {{the architectural}} building which it is overlapping, or even to the landscape. The dome becomes, in this way, not only a religious symbol, but also an identity-making’s one: a protective “umbrella” of the ground and, at the same time, a wedge that pierces the sky, violating it. The perceptive route that it’s introduced, also the main theme of an university research program in progress, clearly shows that communities draw their skies with this sign in a dynamics of imitation, but even more starting a sort of competition to be represented by the most imposing and visible sign. It could be called "the triangle of the three domes", the one which connects along the ancient via <b>Brescia,</b> the <b>province</b> capital to Lonato and, along the smaller way, Lonato to Montichiari: in fact the common denominator is the same rising of signs or volumes that visually recall each other and that allow, in the distance, the immediate recognition of the cities which they belong. Objective of the study is to underline a particular spatial and perceptive order that characterizes a limited area with an unpublished and original analytical point of view, "telling" through photographs and drawings a path that is not only the one of the religiousness, but also and above all, of the identity and of the affirmation, mutual and toward the universe, of the local communities...|$|R
40|$|For foreign {{tourists}} visiting Italy, {{it is not}} uncommon to find tourist information which is far from being well-written and/or well-translated. This is often due to the lack of cultural and linguistic competence of those in charge of tourist promotion. For countries relying on international incoming like Italy, the development of information-retrieval tools specifically designed to enhance the idiomatic quality of multilingual tourist texts has thus become a crucial issue. Given the difficulty to capture the variety of text types and conventions within tourist discourse, a focus on a particular instantiation of tourist communication is a key requirement for creating such a reference tool. The paper reports on the state of the art of a joint research project developed by the Centro Studi sul Turismo (Catholic University of Brescia) and the Zentrum für Translationswissenschaft (University of Vienna). The project consists in the development of a multilingual terminological and textual database (supported by SDL MultiTerm Server), to be used as a resource for LSP teaching and as a reference tool to improve the quality of promotional tourist texts and their translations, both in academic and professional contexts. The corpus consists of Italian texts on the city of <b>Brescia</b> and its <b>province,</b> produced and distributed by the local tourist authorities, as well as parallel texts (at first in German) about destinations with similar characteristics to Brescia. The paper illustrates the different phases of the project (i. e. data collection, corpus design and analysis, data input) and describes the database architecture. Particular attention is devoted to the results of the initial stage, that is the creation and description of the Italian corpus as well as the early phase of data extraction and input. Emphasis is placed on the distinguishing peculiarity of the termbank, namely the integration of rich phraseological, textual and pragmatic information (e. g. recurrent collocations, communicative functions, usage notes, co-textual setting, and so on.) ...|$|R

40|$|Background: For {{the past}} century, {{ferroalloy}} industries in <b>Brescia</b> <b>province,</b> Italy produced particulate emissions enriched in manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), and alu- minum (Al). This study assessed metal concentrations in soil and vegetables of regions with varying ferroalloy industrial activity levels. Methods: Home gardens (n = 63) were selected in three regions of varying ferroalloy plant activity durations in <b>Brescia</b> <b>province.</b> Total soil metal concentration and extractability were measured by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), aqua regia extraction, and modified Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) sequential extraction. Unwashed and washed spinach and turnips cultivated {{in the same}} gardens were analyzed for metal concentrations by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: Median soil Al, Cd, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn concentrations were significantly higher in home gardens near ferroalloy plants compared to reference home gardens. The BCR method yielded the most mobile soil fraction (the sum of extractable metals in Fractions 1 and 2) and all metal concentrations were higher in ferroalloy plant areas. Unwashed spinach showed higher metal concentrations compared to washed spinach. However, some metals in washed spinach {{were higher in the}} reference area likely due to history of agricultural product use. Over 60...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the paper: Italian {{firms are}} {{increasingly}} drawn {{to modify their}} own competitive positioning. Traditional network relations, such as industrial districts or subcontracting value chains, are not themselves sufficient to generate this repositioning, since they are not designed to achieve a strategic goal, but tend to emerge spontaneously. We focus on an evolutionary path, empirically drawn from two case studies, leading {{to the definition of}} strategic network, i. e., an aggregation resulting from joint projects designed to manage the shift of partner firms towards an higher value-added segment of the value chain. Methodology: This paper analyzes the formal network contract as an empirical phenomenon capturing the theoretical concept of strategic network. It does so investigating the case of network contracts flourished in the area of Brescia. Findings: Strategic networks analyzed via two network contracts showed that different strategies exist to exploit value from the diversity of member firms; risks can arise from this diversity; risks can be tackled by means of proper governance mechanisms. Research limits: The analysis is focused on two representative cases. Undoubtedly, enriching this analysis with the observation of networks embedded in other areas would enhance and enrich the discussion raised in the article. Practical implications: The article analyzes the problems tackled, the strategies used, and the solutions selected by the network actors embedded in a network-intensive area (<b>Brescia</b> <b>province).</b> The idea is that these networks can act as a models for other entrepreneurs who want to build new networks or promote the existing ones. Originality of the study: The emergence of networks by means of formal network contracts remains largely unexplored.

40|$|The main lithological and {{petrographical}} {{characteristics of}} the Permian-Lower Triassic Orobic and Brescian successions in cen-tral and eastern Lombardy are briefl y recorded, {{especially with regard to}} the units cropping out below and above the P-T boundary. The lower formation is represented by the Verrucano Lombardo, which consists of continental, fl uvial red clastics, barren of fossils, generally Late Permian (Lopingian) in age, whereas the overlying Servino Formation, which is represented by well-bedded clastic and carbonate polychrome sediments, generally rich in fossils, pertains to the Early Triassic (Induan-Olenekian). The sequences of the two above-mentioned areas differ at least in part, as proof of their regional division, probably because of an inherited paleotopography and syntectonic activity. Taking into account the units bracketing the P-T boundary, which represents the real topic of this work, the Verrucano Lombardo of the Orobic Alps is paraconformably covered by the conglomerates and sand-stones of the Prato Solaro Member in {{the lower part of the}} Servino Formation, cropping out extensively, although discontinuously, from the eastern side of Lake Como to the upper Scalve Valley in the Camonica region. The shape of some quartz rock fragments, derived from the Variscan crystalline basement and its Upper Carboniferous siliciclastic cover, has been interpreted as due to rela-tively coeval aeolian activity, and testifi es to an arid climatic “event ” probably late Dienerian-early Smithian in age.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{changes in}} prevalence {{and distribution of}} HIV- 1 non-subtype B viruses in Italian and immigrant patients over two decades in a province in Italy. All HIV-positive patients who underwent genotypic resistance testing were selected. Prevalence of non-subtype B viruses in 3 -year periods was calculated. All sequences of non-subtype B and those provided by REGA as unassigned were analysed for phylogenetic relationships. In total, 250 / 1563 (16 %) individuals were infected with a non-subtype B virus. Prevalence increased over time, reaching a peak (31 · 5 %) in 2004 – 2006. In Italian patients, the most frequent subtypes were B (92 · 5 %) and F 1 (4 %). F 1 subtype was also prevalent in patients from South America (13 · 6 %); in patients of African origin, CRF 02 _AG (54 · 9 %) and G (12 · 3 %) were the most frequent. HIV- 1 non-subtype B infections in Italians were mostly found in patients who acquired HIV sexually. A phylogenetic relationship between F subtypes in Italian and representative HIV- 1 sequences from Brazil was found. C subtypes in Italians were phylogenetically related to subtypes circulating in Brazil. Inter-subtype recombinants were {{also found in the}} latest years. The HIV- 1 epidemic in <b>Brescia</b> <b>province</b> evolved to the point where about 1 / 3 patients recently diagnosed harboured non-B HIV subtypes. The distribution of HIV- 1 non-B subtypes in Italian patients resembled that in South American patients and phylogenetic relatedness between some Italian and South American HIV- 1 strains was found. The possible epidemiological link between these two populations would have been missed by looking only at risk factors for HIV acquisition declared by patients. The evidence of inter-subtype recombinants points to significant genetic assortment. Overall our results support phylogenetic analysis as a tool for epidemiological investigation in order to guide targeted prevention strategies...|$|E
40|$|At the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences of the University of Milano-Bicocca (DISAT-UNIMIB), a hydrogeological well database, called TANGRAM©, {{has been}} {{developed}} and published on line at www. TANGRAM. samit. unimib. it, developing an earlier 1989 DOS version. This package {{can be used to}} store, display, and process all data related to water wells, including administrative information, well characteristics, stratigraphic logs, water levels, pumping rates, and other hydrogeological information. Currently, the database contains more than 39. 200 wells located in the Italian region of Lombardy (90 %), Piedmont (9 %) and Valle d’Aosta (1 %). TANGRAM© has been created both as a tool for researches and for public administration’s administrators who have projects in common with DISAT-UNIMIB. Indeed, transferring wells data from paper into TANGRAM© offers both an easier and more robust way to correlate hydrogeological data and a more organized management of the administrative information. Some Administrations use TANGRAM© regularly as a tool for wells data management (<b>Brescia</b> <b>Province,</b> ARPA Valle Aosta). An innovative aspect of the database is the quantitative extraction of stratigraphic data. In the part of the software intended for research purposes, all well logs are translated into 8 -digit alphanumeric codes and the user composes the code interpreting the description at each stratigraphic level. So the stratigraphic well data can be coded, then quantified and processed. This is made possible by attributing a weight to the digits of the code for textures. The program calculates the weighted percentage of the chosen lithology, as related to each individual layer. These extractions are the starting point for subsequent hydrogeological studies: well head protection area, reconstruction of the dynamics of flow, realization of the quarry plans and flux and transport hydrogeological models. The results of a two-dimensional distribution of coarse, medium and fine sized material in the first 80 meters of depth are presented here for a study area located within the Province of Brescia (Italy) ...|$|E
40|$|Milk {{coagulation}} {{is based}} on a series of physicochemical changes at the casein micelle level, resulting in formation of a gel. Milk coagulation properties (MCP) are relevant for cheese quality and yield, important factors for the dairy industry. They are also evaluated in herd bulk milk to reward or penalize producers of Protected Designation of Origin cheeses. The economic importance of improving MCP justifies the need to account for this trait in the selection process. A pilot study was carried out to determine the feasibility of including MCP in the selection schemes of the Italian Holstein. The MCP were predicted in 1, 055 individual milk samples collected in 16 herds (66 ± 24 cows per herd) located in <b>Brescia</b> <b>province</b> (northeastern Italy) by means of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The coefficient of determination of prediction models indicated moderate predictions for milk rennet coagulation time (RCT= 0. 65) and curd firmness (a 30 = 0. 68), and poor predictions for curd-firming time (k 20 = 0. 49), whereas the range error ratio (8. 9, 6. 9, and 9. 5 for RCT, k 20, and a 30, respectively) indicated good practical utility of the predictive models for all parameters. Milk proteins were genotyped and casein haplotypes (αS 1 -, β-, αS 2 -, and κ-casein) were reconstructed. Data from 51 half-sib families (19. 9 ± 16. 4 daughters per sire) were analyzed by an animal model to estimate (1) the genetic parameters of predicted RCT, k 20, and a 30; (2) the breeding values for these predicted clotting variables; and (3) the effect of milk protein genotypes and casein haplotypes on predicted MCP (pMCP). This is the first study to estimate both genetic parameters and breeding values of pMCP, together with the effects of milk protein genotypes and casein haplotypes, that also considered k 20, probably the most important parameter for the dairy industry (because it indicates the time for the beginning of curd-cutting). Heritability of predicted RCT (0. 26) and k 20 (0. 31) were close to the average heritability described in literature, whereas the heritability of a 30 was higher (0. 52 vs. 0. 27). The effects of milk proteins were statistically significant and similar to those obtained on measured MCP. In particular, haplotypes including uncommon variants showed positive (B-I-A-B) or negative (B-A 1 -A-E) effects. Based on these findings, FTIR spectroscopy-pMCP is proposed as a potential selection criterion for the Italian Holstein. © 2014 American Dairy Science Association...|$|E
