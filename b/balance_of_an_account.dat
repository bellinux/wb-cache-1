60|$|It {{contributes}} greatly {{towards a}} man's moral and intellectual health {{to be brought}} into habits of companionship with individuals unlike himself, who care little for his pursuits, and whose sphere and abilities he must go out of himself to appreciate. The accidents of my life have often afforded me this advantage, but never with more fulness and variety than during my continuance in office. There was one man, especially, the observation of whose character gave me a new idea of talent. His gifts were emphatically those of a man of business; prompt, acute, clear-minded; with an eye that saw through all perplexities, and a faculty of arrangement that made them vanish as by the waving of an enchanter's wand. Bred up from boyhood in the Custom-House, it was his proper field of activity; and the many intricacies of business, so harassing to the interloper, presented themselves before him with the regularity of a perfectly comprehended system. In my contemplation, he stood as the ideal of his class. He was, indeed, the Custom-House in himself; or, at all events, the mainspring that kept its variously revolving wheels in motion; for, in an institution like this, where its officers are appointed to subserve their own profit and convenience, and seldom with a leading reference to their fitness for the duty to be performed, they must perforce seek elsewhere the dexterity which is not in them. Thus, by an inevitable necessity, as a magnet attracts steel-filings, so did our man of business draw to himself the difficulties which everybody met with. With an easy condescension, and kind forbearance towards our stupidity--which, to his order of mind, must have seemed little short of crime--would he forth-with, by the merest touch of his finger, make the incomprehensible as clear as daylight. The merchants valued him not less than we, his esoteric friends. His integrity was perfect; it was a law of nature with him, rather than a choice or a principle; nor can it be otherwise than the main condition of an intellect so remarkably clear and accurate as his {{to be honest and}} regular in the administration of affairs. A stain on his conscience, as to anything that came within the range of his vocation, would trouble such a man very much in the same way, though to a far greater degree, than an error in the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>account,</b> or an ink-blot on the fair page of a book of record. Here, in a word--and it is a rare instance in my life--I had met with a person thoroughly adapted to the situation which he held.|$|E

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) In {{this thesis}} we are {{concerned}} with valuing options on traded accounts using both continuous and discrete time models. An option on <b>a</b> traded <b>account</b> is <b>a</b> zero strike call on the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trading <b>account</b> which consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> position <b>of</b> size θ in a risky asset (which we refer to as a stock) and the remaining wealth in <b>a</b> risk-free <b>account.</b> The choice of trading positions throughout {{the life of the}} option are made by the buyer, subject to constraints specified in the contract at the time of purchase. The specification of these trading constraints gives rise to some of the more well known examples including passport options and vacation options. At maturity, the option buyer is entitled to any positive wealth accumulated in the trading account whilst any losses are covered by the option seller. First, we examine the problem of valuing these options in continuous time. <b>A</b> review <b>of</b> some existing methods is presented, including <b>a</b> complete derivation <b>of</b> the pricing formula for the passport option and the option on <b>a</b> traded <b>account</b> following the methods proposed by Hyer et al. (1997) and Shreve and Vecer (2000), though we often use different techniques to those authors. We also present an alternative derivation for the value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> passport option using our own methodology which we believe is simpler than those currently available. Secondly, we consider the valuation problem in a discrete time setting by looking at one specific discrete time model, the binomial tree. This is a new contribution to the literature as binomial models for these options have not been previously examined. Using this approach, the greatest difficulty is the determination <b>of</b> <b>an</b> optimal trading strategy which is required to price this class of option. We show that in general, binomial models and continuous time models {{do not have the same}} trading strategy, and in fact that the analytic determination of the trading strategy for an option on <b>a</b> traded <b>account</b> may in fact be impossible to obtain. We then turn to passport options, where we are able to derive an analytic optimal strategy which in this case is identical to that used in the continuous time models, thus the problem of valuing passport options is reduced to the same computational burdens as a binomial valuation without recombining branches. Lastly, we examine some numerical methods which could be used to value options on traded accounts with binomial models. Our problem is shown to be an NP-hard convex maximisation which we convert into both an l 1 -norm convex maximisation and an indefinite quadratic program. Whilst we present algorithms which are guaranteed to obtain the optimal solution, they are also known to be inefficient and thus inappropriate for any likely application beyond a few time steps. We conclude by summarising our results and give directions for future research in this area...|$|R

40|$|Ingeniero IndustrialWithin 30 years, the Internet {{has grown}} from a Cold War concept for {{controlling}} the tattered remains <b>of</b> <b>a</b> post-nuclear society, to the Information Superhighway as we know it today. Just as the railroads of the 19 th century lead to the heyday of the Industrial Age, which revolutionized the society, the Internet takes us into the Information Age, and profoundly will affect {{the world in which we}} live. Today people communicate over the Internet, schools and universities use it’s a huge electronic library, with untold possibilities and doctors use it to consult with colleagues half a world away. As a new generation grows up, as accustomed to communicating through a keyboard as in person, life on the Internet will become an increasingly important part of life on Earth. Since its invention in 1991 a single internet service, called World Wide Web (WWW), has attracted considerable attention and has left the competitive services far behind in popularity. Actually designed as a worldwide forum for nuclear physics, the "Web" rapidly has turned into an impressive marketplace. This project aims to offer a solution for the internet presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> financial company. Many elements that might occur on such a bank's web site will change frequently. The interest rate <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mortgage, for example, is exposed to oscillations. A web page describing such a mortgage consequently will need to be altered whenever one of the various conditions change. The problem a web page developer usually faces, is that the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which defines the appearance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> web page, is as static as any other text document, i. e. once <b>a</b> certain piece <b>of</b> content has to be changed, one has to open the document in an editor and to do the modification manually. In this project, this problem will be solved by creating many of the web pages dynamically, i. e. on the fly, through the so-called Common Gateway Interface (CGI). The CGI programs or scripts will query an Oracle database that holds the data that is necessary for the web presentation and will format the query results in a manner that allows them to be presented as an HTML document. The data does not only consist of interest rates for numerous credits and mortgages, but also includes all the product information and the text paragraphs that later will farm the product descriptions. Marketing departments, for instance, tend to be rather inventive when it comes to advertising special offers far new clients, or for those who have sealed mortgages, credits, or pension schemes. It definitely will be of great help to allow <b>an</b> employee <b>of</b> the marketing department to access the database and quickly change the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>an</b> offer, instead <b>of</b> forcing him to enter the HTML code or to contact the person responsible for the web site. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> this project, the web site <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fictitious bank, "El Banco Miami", has been created, presenting <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> imaginable products and services a bank may supply. The client, for example, not only will be able to view the latest changes of the interest rate for the mortgage he has, but additionally he will have the option to have the amount of his monthly installment calculated interactively. Moreover, a visitor can demand a bank statement via the Web by filling his personal data into a form and sending it to the bank. The bank's database will process the data and if the visitor turns out to be a customer, a detailed bank statement will be returned. However, this project is not about internet banking, and the latter feature is supposed to demonstrate the underlying techniques for passing data from a front-end application (the web browser) to the back-end (the data base) and vice-versa. The aspect of the necessary security requirements for transmissions containing private data, like the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person's <b>account,</b> will not be in the focus of this project, because even the majority of the banks, at the present point of time, have not found a common security standard, and thus dare not offer internet banking [Bir 96], [Flo 96]. Figure 1 - 1 outlines the basic elements of this project and gives a preview about the structure of this report: Chapter 2 deals with the front-end part of the whole information system, or to put it bluntly, it deals with what the web user finally sees in his browser window. Speaking of the web user, an important as well as interesting question arises: Who is that web user, what are his habits and intentions and how does he use the World Wide Web? In this chapter many of these questions will be answered and <b>a</b> vague picture <b>of</b> how the bank's target audience looks like, will emerge. Web documents are plain text documents defined by means of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Nearly anybody, who has spent a few hours surfing the Web, is able to create HTML documents, especially if he has one of those many (sometimes good but rather bad) HTML editors available. During the investigation for this project I have seen many badly designed Web pages and sites, and another interesting question arose: Are there general design rules that help making a site more successful? This question will be answered thoroughly and finally a solution for "El banco Miami" will be presented. The report will not follow the information flow according to Figure 1 - 1, but continue at the back-end of the system, the database. The database is the fundamental part, the core of the entire system, as it holds all the necessary data for creating the web pages. Chapter 3 starts with a brief overview about Database Management Systems (DBMS) in general and relational DBMS in particular. Finally the creation of the database objects, which are essential to the bank's web presence will be described, with special emphasis of security and access control aspects. Chapter 4 classes the gap between front-end and back-end, explaining how the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) works. Through CGI, the user requests coming from the web browser are processed, transformed into a format that the database can understand, and finally the database query is performed. The query results are returned to the gateway program and formatted in a way that allows them to be shown as an HTML document. Chapter 5 will analyze the means for securing the internal network of the bank from attacks from the Internet. A brief overview about Firewall architectures will be given, resulting in <b>a</b> recommendation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Firewall system that may serve the bank's requirements. This chapter also describes how to secure the internet services HTTP and DNS which are obligatory when a site decides to take part in the World Wide Web...|$|R
