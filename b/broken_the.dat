5|$|Doxorubicin {{interacts with}} DNA by {{intercalation}} and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits {{the progression of}} topoisomerase II, an enzyme which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. It may also increase quinone type free radical production, hence contributing to its cytotoxicity.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Bradman, generally regarded as the greatest batsman of all time, {{and the fact that}} he had announced that it was his farewell international tour, the Australians were greeted with much fanfare across the country, and many records for match attendances were <b>broken.</b> <b>The</b> record for Test attendance at a match in England was broken three times, in the Second, Third and Fourth Tests, and stands to this day.|$|E

5|$|After {{traveling}} through Delphi, the warrior obtained the venomous blood of a cerberus. Eventually, both Circe and the warrior encountered the general, who was {{revealed to be}} the warrior's uncle. The general revealed that he killed the warrior's father because he refused to join the general. Circe was then revealed to be the general's lover who had only aided the warrior so he would reach the general, who planned to offer the warrior a chance to serve him in his warmongering conquests. The warrior refused, and Circe offered him with a choice; to serve the general and his men would be spared from Circe's wrath, or to kill the general and his men shall die. The Giver, who followed the two, reminded the warrior {{that if he were}} to kill the general, {{who was a member of}} his family, the oath he made to his father would be broken, yet if he killed Circe, his men would perish and the oath he made to protect his men would be <b>broken.</b> <b>The</b> warrior declared that he would not slay Circe and defended the lives of his men. He tricked the general into drinking from a cup he had secretly filled with the cerberus's blood, which killed the general. Circe was aghast at the warrior's vengeful act and retreated. Because the warrior killed his own uncle, the oath he made to his father was <b>broken.</b> <b>The</b> Giver revealed himself to be Orkos, the oath keeper of the Furies and the warrior was imprisoned by the Furies in the Prison of the Damned.|$|E

Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E
