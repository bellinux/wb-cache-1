5|$|At the US Open, Del Potro {{defeated}} Henri Laaksonen, Adrián Menéndez-Maceiras and Roberto Bautista Agut {{in straight}} sets, putting his <b>best</b> <b>year</b> performance to date against Bautista Agut. He began his fourth round match against Dominic Thiem greatly struggling, falling 1-6, 2-6 behind. However, he then raised his level and, {{with the help}} of the crowd, he eventually prevailed in five sets, including saving two match points in the fourth set with two aces. In the post match interview he admitted he considered retiring from the match during the second set.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the Bruins for the 1945–46 NHL season, Bauer was {{reunited with}} his Kraut Line teammates. Unlike many players who had left for the war, he {{remained}} in peak form. However, after scoring 22 points that season, Bauer contemplated retirement. He chose to return for one additional season and was named the Bruins captain for 1946–47. Bauer had his <b>best</b> <b>year</b> in the NHL: he recorded a team-leading 30 goals and finished seventh overall in league scoring with 54 points. He was named to a fourth All-Star Team and won the Lady Byng Trophy for the third time. Following the season, he announced his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Crossland {{was born}} in Nottinghamshire, but {{qualified}} to play for Lancashire County Cricket Club due to his residency there. He made his first-class debut for his adopted county in 1878, but his bowling was most effective from 1881 until 1884. His <b>best</b> <b>year</b> was 1882, when he topped the national bowling averages, claiming 112 wickets {{at an average of}} just over ten. The presence of Crossland, {{and a number of other}} bowlers with suspect actions, in the Lancashire team resulted in some counties refusing to play fixtures against them during the mid-1880s. In 1885, a ruling from the Marylebone Cricket Club barred Crossland from playing for Lancashire as his qualification for the county had been breached by him living in Nottinghamshire during the winter. The ruling forced his retirement from county cricket, though he continued to appear in other first-class matches for a few years following that.|$|E

5|$|In July 1869 Van Gogh's uncle Cent {{obtained}} a position {{for him at}} the art dealers Goupil & Cie in The Hague. After completing his training in 1873, he was transferred to Goupil's London branch at Southampton Street, and took lodgings at 87 Hackford Road, Stockwell. This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work, and at 20 was earning more than his father. Theo's wife later remarked that this was the <b>best</b> <b>year</b> of Vincent's life. He became infatuated with his landlady's daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but was rejected after confessing his feelings; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger. He grew more isolated, and religiously fervent. His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became resentful of issues such as {{the degree to which the}} firm commodified art, and was dismissed a year later.|$|E
5|$|Before Mota {{ever played}} for the Red Sox, however, he was traded again to the Cleveland Indians. He {{struggled}} in his time with the Indians in 2006 and was designated for assignment by them in August. The New York Mets acquired him, and Mota improved mightily upon joining them. Following the season, he became a free agent, but he again signed with the Mets. After struggling in 2007, he {{was traded to the}} Milwaukee Brewers. He got off to a poor start with Milwaukee in 2008 but improved in the second half. Following the season, Mota became a free agent and signed with the Dodgers again. He had his <b>best</b> <b>year</b> since 2004 and became a free agent again after the season. For {{the first time in his}} career, in 2010 he signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants. After making the team out of spring training, Mota won his first career World Series despite struggling at times during the season. Following the season, he signed another minor league contract with the Giants and made the team out of spring training again. During the 2012 season, Mota became one of three players in league history to fail a drug test twice when it was shown he tested positive for Clenbuterol, a performance-enhancing drug.|$|E
