40|$|The joint has a rigid hub (3) mounted {{inside an}} annular rigid {{armature}} (2). A flexible material is interposed between the hub and the armature for ensuring certain clearance and filtration of vibrations. A <b>breaker</b> <b>arm</b> rubbing block (4) is disposed between the hub and the armature, and produces a dampening effect by alternation of adherence and sliding for {{the displacement of}} the hub and the armature along a longitudinal direction of a torque reaction rod (1) ...|$|E
2500|$|A Williamson County {{grand jury}} {{investigating}} the incident faulted the Southern Illinois Coal Company for introducing strike <b>breakers</b> and <b>armed</b> guards, and for committing illegal {{activities such as}} closing public highways. It criticized the state administration for refusing to take necessary measures once the trouble had begun. Herbert David Croly of The New Republic criticized the state of Illinois for allowing the Illinois Chamber of Commerce to fund the investigation.|$|R
50|$|The first {{match that}} aired on the {{pay-per-view}} was the World Heavyweight Championship match, between The Big Show and the defending World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio. For the finish, Del Rio enzuigiri kicked Ricardo Rodriguez's bucket that Show was holding {{into his head}} which eventually led to his signature cross <b>arm</b> <b>breaker</b> for the submission victory.|$|R
5000|$|With Albright {{finishing}} {{third in}} the tournament and Vader defeating Takada to win the tournament the UWFi started to promote a meeting between Vader and Albright as an UWFi “Dream Match". Building up to the singles title match the two faced off {{in a couple of}} tag-team matches leading up to the big event. On October 8, 1994, Albright forced Vader to submit to the cross <b>arm</b> <b>breaker</b> in a main event tag team match, then on November 30, 1994, Albright forced Takada to submit to a cross <b>arm</b> <b>breaker</b> in the main event to earn a match with Vader in January. The UWFi [...] "Dream Match" [...] took place on January 16, 1995, a match that saw Vader winning the match in 11:25 using a choke hold. The build up and the match were a commercial success, with Albright and Vader drawing large sellout crowds in their two tag team main events, Albright's contenders match with Takada, and the Vader versus Albright title match.|$|R
5|$|While moving {{within the}} cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit <b>breaker</b> that would <b>arm</b> the main engine for lift {{off from the}} Moon. There was concern this would prevent firing the engine, {{stranding}} them on the Moon. Fortunately, a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch. Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.|$|R
50|$|Pallo was a {{risk-taking}} athlete on the {{one hand}} but pushed credibility to the limits at other times owing to his over-the-top cockiness. Fans rejoiced in his sit-on back <b>breaker</b> and <b>arm</b> lever, his aeroplane spin, and his cross-shoulder backbreaker. Pallo's star was further affirmed when a 1964 date in Bishop's Stortford sold out in only 3 hours. His sole major accolade during his career was a short 1969 run as the British Heavy Middleweight Champion, having defeated Bert Royal on 21 April before dropping the title back to Royal the following month. His feud with McManus was featured in the 2012 BBC documentary When Wrestling Was Golden: Grapples, Grunts and Grannies.|$|R
5000|$|Next, John Cena {{challenged}} Alberto Del Rio for the WWE Championship. During the match, Del Rio {{applied the}} Cross <b>Arm</b> <b>Breaker,</b> but Cena powered out of it. Ricardo Rodriguez tried to interfere, but Cena knocked {{him off the}} apron. At {{the end of the}} match, Cena executed an AA on Del Rio and applied the STF on Del Rio. Del Rio submitted, resulting in Cena winning his tenth WWE Championship.|$|R
5000|$|Karl Gotch was a catch wrestler and {{a student}} of Billy Riley's [...] "Snake Pit" [...] {{training}} school in the Whelley area of Wigan in Greater Manchester. Gotch taught catch wrestling to Japanese professional wrestlers in the 1970s including Antonio Inoki, Tatsumi Fujinami, Hiro Matsuda, Osamu Kido, Satoru Sayama (Tiger Mask) and Yoshiaki Fujiwara. Starting from 1976, one of these professional wrestlers, Inoki, hosted a series of mixed martial arts bouts against the champions of other disciplines. This resulted in unprecedented popularity of the clash-of-styles bouts in Japan. His matches showcased catch wrestling moves like the sleeper hold, cross <b>arm</b> <b>breaker,</b> seated armbar, Indian deathlock and keylock.|$|R
5000|$|That same year, he {{competed for}} BAW Championship Wrestling. Although losing to [...] "Big Ugly" [...] JD Bishop on April 20, he beat Drake Frost and Alexis Smirnoff, Jr. during the summer. While in New Revolution Wrestling, he and Ritchie Magnett feuded with the NRW Tag Team Champions the Pacific Coast Blondes (Cameron Starr & Hearthrob Hanson) facing {{them in a}} series of matches during the summer, {{including}} a Canadian Lumberjack match in June 2007. Bergstrom defeated Tod Ruhl who submitted to a cross <b>arm</b> <b>breaker</b> at the [...] "Final Friday" [...] supercard in Gresham, Oregon on July 27, 2007. When Ruhl's valet Megan Nicole Desire attempted to distract the referee, Bergstrom pulled her into the ring.

50|$|Karl Gotch was a catch wrestler and {{a student}} of Billy Riley's Snake Pit in Whelley, Wigan. In the film Catch: the hold not taken, {{some of those who}} trained with Gotch in Wigan talk of his fascination with the {{traditional}} Lancashire style of wrestling and how he was inspired to stay and train at Billy Riley's after experiencing its effects first hand during a professional show in Manchester, England. After leaving Wigan, he later went on to teach catch wrestling to Japanese professional wrestlers in the 1970s to students including Antonio Inoki, Tatsumi Fujinami, Hiro Matsuda, Osamu Kido, Satoru Sayama (Tiger Mask) and Yoshiaki Fujiwara. Starting from 1976, one of these professional wrestlers, Inoki, hosted a series of mixed martial arts bouts against the champions of other disciplines.

His matches showcased catch wrestling moves like the sleeper hold, cross <b>arm</b> <b>breaker,</b> seated armbar, Indian deathlock and keylock.|$|R
5000|$|Albright {{made his}} debut with UWFi on August 24, 1991, {{knocking}} out Yoji Anjoh in 7:29. Albright's massive size and his amateur background made his suplexes seem very impressive, {{to add to}} Albright’s “Suplex machine" [...] image he was typically booked to win by knocking out his opponents with brutal German suplexes such as his 5:26 victory by knock out over Kiyoshi Tamura on December 22, 1991. The highlight of Gary Albright’s initial UWFi push came on May 8, 1992 when he knocked out Nobuhiko Takada with his signature German suplex at Yokohama Arena {{in front of an}} announced crowd of 14,000. Takada was UWFi’s biggest Japanese star, the loss to Albright helped cement him as a serious competitor in the UWFi. Albright continued his winning ways in singles and tag matches through the summer of 1992 defeating such notable competitors as [...] "Bad News" [...] Brown. Albright's string of victories came to an end when he lost a rematch with Takada on September 21, 1992. Albright submitted to Takada's cross <b>arm</b> <b>breaker,</b> thus making Takada the first UWFi World champion.|$|R
2500|$|The Metropolitan Police {{officers}} were unarmed to clearly distinguish them from military enforcers, {{which had been}} the system of policing seen before the 1820s. Their uniform was also styled in blue, rather than the military red. Despite the service being unarmed, the then Home Secretary, Robert Peel, gave authorisation to the Commissioner to purchase fifty flintlock pistols, for exceptional incidents that required the use of firearms. As time progressed, the obsolete flintlocks were decommissioned from service, being superseded by early revolvers. At the time, burglary (or [...] "house breaking" [...] {{as it was then}} called) was a common problem for police, as house <b>breakers</b> were usually <b>armed.</b> Due to the deaths of officers at the hands of armed criminals in the outer districts of the Metropolis, and after much press coverage debating whether Peel's service should be fully armed, the Commissioner applied to the Home Secretary to supply all officers on the outer districts with revolvers. These could only be issued if, in the opinion of the senior officer, the officer could be trusted to use it safely, and with discretion. From that point, officers who felt the need to be armed, could be so. The practice lasted until 1936, although {{the vast majority of the}} system was phased out by the end of the 19th century.|$|R
