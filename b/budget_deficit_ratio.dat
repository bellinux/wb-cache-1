The government fixes the <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>ratio.</b> If the deficit ratio stays below a critical level, then there are two steady states where capital, output, and public debt grow at the same constant rate. An increase in the deficit ratio reduces the growth rate. If the deficit ratio exceeds the critical level, {{then there is no}} steady state.

The analysis on this {{research is}} based on time series data and is processed by utilizing the simultaneous equation model. The result of the analysis indicates that market size variable and variation in the exchange rate yields in a positive FDI flow. Bigger GDP shows a large market size, the condition which reduces market offer value and lowers cost per output unit. Fluctuating exchange rate shows uncertain business prospect. Other variables such as real exchange rate, <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>ratio</b> on GDP and interest rate yields a negative influence on FDI. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) provides positive influence on the economic growth rate. The investment fills the resource gap between the target investment rate and the actual domestic savings. Besides that, the foreign investment encourages economic growth through transfer of technology. Direct Foreign Investment provides {{a positive effect on}} export performance. It means that Indonesia's FDI is a pro-trade FDI. Hence, it increases trade and exchange balance. Pro-trade FDI means investment in industries where the country lacks of comparative strength...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} and empirical research has considered how differences in political arrangements affecting national policy formation might explain variation in fiscal policies pursued (Volkerink and de Haan, 2001). The experience of high government deficits of developed nations in the 1980 s led researchers to analyze {{the reasons for this}} and among other factors they have argued that political variables could also explain <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> (Sutter, 2003). This study aims to investigate the effects of the political parties for fiscal deficits in Turkey for 1976 - 2004 period. Our results show that the most important variable in explaining the <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> to GDP <b>ratio</b> in Turkey is its lagged value. The political dispersion index variable, which measures the effect of the number of parties in the government in power, has proven to have a minor effect. Only the coalition governments with two or more parties are found to have higher <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> to GDP <b>ratios.</b> Ideology of the governments in power is important for the <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> to GDP <b>ratio</b> when it is considered with the number of parties in the government in power.

40|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised in regards to how to redress a {{decreasing}} trend in national saving in South Africa. A number of authors have suggested that redressing government saving, through fiscal discipline characterised by a low government <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>ratio,</b> should be a key in redressing the national saving trend in South Africa. In order to assess this hypothesis, this paper studies the dynamics of gross national saving, government saving and private saving in response to fiscal shocks, by using the impulse response functions (IRF) obtained from the structural vector autoregressive (SVAR). The paper constructs a structural model, contrary to the reduced-form models used {{in a number of}} studies, to assess the response of savings to fiscal shocks. The aim of this paper is twofold: while determining the extent to which fiscal policy influences savings in South Africa, the paper also offers to test whether the Ricardian Equivalence proposition holds in South Africa. The paper concludes that the full Ricardian Equivalence does not hold in the short term and in the long term the response of national saving to fiscal policy shocks is neutral. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze {{causality}} between budget deficits and its ratio to gross domestic product and interest rate in the Turkish economy during years between 2006 and 2011. By doing so, we investigate the validity of crowding out view against the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis. To this end, we employee the conventional Toda-Yamamoto (1995) linear Granger type causality test and Hacker and Hatemi-J (2005, 2006) bootstrap process-based Toda-Yamamoto linear Granger type causality test. In this regard, we use Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin (1992, KPSS) and Elliot, Rothenberg, Stock (1996, DF-GLS) unit root tests. Analysis results show that there is no causal relation between budget deficits, <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>ratio</b> to gross domestic product and nominal interest rate. Results reveal the existence of Ricardian equivalence hypothesis. Rational household predict that there is no difference between payment time of taxes and they know that expansionary fiscal policies financed by loan do not affect aggregate demand and capital allocation in a full-employment economy via nominal interest rate channel. Results of empirical analysis support Ricardian equivalence hypothesis and imply that there is no effect of financing type of budget deficit on nominal interest rate...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of EconomicsSteven P. CassouThis essay empirically {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} between government debt and <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> in the United States during a recession {{as opposed to}} an expansion. We use four different <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> definitions to develop a more comprehensive insight. We estimate a threshold VAR model on quarterly data from 1947 : Q 1 to 2016 : Q 3 on debt to GDP and <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> to GDP <b>ratio</b> for the United States. Specification test using LR test rejects the null for a linear VAR against nonlinear VAR. The nonlinear impulse responses indicate, with an increase to <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> to GDP <b>ratio,</b> government debt to GDP ratio rise faster during a recession {{as opposed to an}} expansion, and tend to move in a counter-cyclical manner with an increase in the output gap. We can thus infer that governments chose economic stability over fiscal balance during recessions. With an increase in government debt to GDP ratio, nonlinear impulse response show <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> to GDP <b>ratio</b> grow faster during an expansion as opposed to a recession and exhibit counter-cyclicality with an increase in the output gap. All four budget defi cits definitions depict similar pattern. Robustness check, using cyclically adjusted primary <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> published by the congressional Budget Office, also con rm the above findings. In this essay, we explore the presence of a long run relationship between the monetary base and the government debt using monthly data from 1942 : 1 to 2015 : 12. We apply formal statistical methods including cointegration and threshold cointegration tests to investigate the presence of a long-run relationship and estimate a threshold vector error-correction model (TVECM henceforth) to analyze the short-run dynamics. We find the presence of a threshold cointegration between the monetary base and government debt. As for the short-run dynamics, TVECM estimates show that the speed of adjustment is significant for the growth in debt equation in both regimes with the signs indicating government adjusting the debt in the short-run. But the U. S. Fed does not change the monetary base, hence we do not find any evidence of debt monetization in the U. S. We evaluate our findings over two sub-samples: 1946 to 2015 and 1946 to 2007 for robustness purposes. Findings from both sub-samples conform to our findings from the full sample. In this essay, we investigate the impacts of growth in the <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> and money supply on real interest rate are integral to contemporary macroeconomic policy. We employ threshold VAR and nonlinear impulse responses using quarterly data from 1959 to 2015. We find that growth in money supply and <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> have an asymmetric impact on inflation, short-term interest rate, and real interest rates. Growth in money supply and <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> tend to make the real interest rate negative in a bad state.

Following {{a review of}} the literature, this paper examines the relationship between a variety of political-institutional variables and fiscal aggregates-encompassing the overall balance as well as expenditure and revenue and their various components-across 19 industrial countries over the past two decades. It finds strong effects on fiscal policy from such factors as type of electoral system, degree of legislative or government fragmentation, and stability of government. Some of the strongest results emerge for certain components of expenditure, such as transfers, and for the balance between labor and consumption taxation. There are clear relationships between the type of political system and choice of tax and expenditure system. The paper also examines fiscal adjustment since the late 1980 s in light of these political factors, finding some evidence of a reversal in trend, but only when growth has been high or when debt has become problematic.

The results reveal that the variables under study are cointegrated {{and there is a}} bi-directional causality between <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> and nominal effective exchange rates. However, we have not observed any significant relationship between <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> and GDP, Money supply & consumer price index. It is also observed that the GDP Granger-causes <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> where as <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> does not. ...|$|R

First, it reviews standard theory about how <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> influence saving, investment, the trade balance, interest rates, exchange rates, and long-term growth. Second, it offers a rough estimate {{of the magnitude of}} some of the effects. Third, it discusses how <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> affect economic welfare. Finally, it considers the possibility that continuing <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> in a country could lead to a 'hard landing' in which the demand for the country's assets suddenly collapses. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the first}} years of this century, Germany’s public {{finances}} developed very unfavourably. Significant pressures to reduce the overall <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> emerged. However, not least given the budgetary autonomy of the individual federal states and their influence on federal legislation, for several years central government failed to bring the German <b>deficit</b> <b>ratio</b> back below the Maastricht threshold by means of consolidation measures. Recourse to temporary measures remained limited, while Eurostat was reluctant to accept deficit-decreasing entries in the national accounts. With regard to national fiscal rules, asset sales and securitisations were used to avoid too obvious conflicts. Following the significant decrease in <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> experienced since the end of 2005, current European and national fiscal rules are now respected without circumventions. However, a planned tightening of national borrowing limits as well as the European aim to have a structurally balanced budgetary position might lead to a search for new sidestepping measures. Public-private partnerships – despite possible cost advantages – seem {{to be a part of}} such efforts. At the local government level, outsourcing seems to distort budgetary data, but the net effect on deficits should be negligible. borrowing limits, deficit, public private partnerships, temporary measures. ...|$|R

The purpose of the paper is to investigate the relationship between <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> and macroeconomic fundamentals using data from Azerbaijan. The empirical analysis applies ARDL Cointegration methodology in conjunction with Granger causality tests to provide evidence for both the long and short run dynamics between the variables involved in the analysis. Using the Error Correction specification, there was found evidence of long-run causality running from current account, real interest rate, GDP, inflation and exchange rate to <b>budget</b> <b>deficit.</b> There was also found evidence of short-run Granger causal effects running from current account and real interest rate towards <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> and a rather weak causal effect from inflation to <b>budget</b> <b>deficit.</b> However, there is no short – run causality running from interest rate to <b>budget</b> <b>deficit...</b>|$|R
