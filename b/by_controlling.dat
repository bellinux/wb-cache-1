5|$|A {{variety of}} {{ammunition}} {{has been developed}} for use by tanks with guns based on Rheinmetall's original L/44 design. This includes a series of kinetic energy penetrators, such as the American M829 series, and high explosive anti-tank warheads. Recent ammunition includes a range of anti-personnel rounds and demolition munitions. The LAHAT, developed in Israel, is a gun-launched missile which has received interest from Germany and other Leopard 2 users, and is designed to defeat both land armour and combat helicopters. The Israelis also introduced a new anti-personnel munition which limits collateral damage <b>by</b> <b>controlling</b> the fragmentation of the projectile.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} long-eared spaniels, Russian Spaniels require checks to prevent ear infections. The breed {{does have an}} {{inclination}} to gain weight easily, which can be prevented <b>by</b> <b>controlling</b> food intake. The Russian Spaniel can be prone to food allergies, which are usually identified at between 1 and 5 months of age with the most common allergens being chicken and carrots. There are no other breed-specific health issues currently known.|$|E
5|$|Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) is an HDMI feature {{designed}} to allow the user to command and control up to 15 CEC-enabled devices, that are connected through HDMI, by using only one of their remote controls (for example <b>by</b> <b>controlling</b> a television set, set-top box, and DVD player using only the remote control of the TV). CEC also allows for individual CEC-enabled devices to command and control each other without user intervention.|$|E
5|$|Frog Fractions is a 2012 browser game {{developed}} by Twinbeard Studios, a company composed primarily of founder Jim Crawford. The game, released on October 25, 2012, {{has been described}} as a spoof of the edutainment game genre. In the game, the player begins <b>by</b> <b>controlling</b> a frog to eat bugs and defend fruit. Later on, the player may spend points on upgrades to improve their frog's abilities. The game does not actually teach the player about fractions; the player's score is given in fractions, but no knowledge of them is necessary to play.|$|E

5|$|General Nguyễn Khánh {{had come}} to power in January 1964 after {{surprising}} the ruling junta of General Dương Văn Minh in a pre-dawn operation, taking control without firing a shot. Because of American pressure, he retained the popular Minh as a token head of state, while holding the real power <b>by</b> <b>controlling</b> the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC). In August, the Vietnam War expanded with the Tonkin Gulf incident, a disputed encounter between North Vietnamese and American naval vessels; Washington accused the communists of launching an attack in international waters.|$|E
5|$|Homer-Dixon {{explains}} how his theory {{was influenced by}} endogenous or new growth theory in which ideas are a factor of production independent of labour and capital. He distinguishes his stance from Neo-Malthusianism which seeks to manage systems <b>by</b> <b>controlling</b> demand and from market fundamentalism which believe free markets can provide timely solutions to any problem. Several problems in advancing basic science are identified: human cognitive limits, intrinsic complexity of field, limits of scientific institutions, and social and cultural values regarding science.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the calculation of association, {{it is common to}} take into account any variables that could potentially confound the results. Sex and age are common examples of confounding variables. Moreover, it is also known that many genetic variations are associated with the geographical and historical populations in which the mutations first arose. Because of this association, studies must take account of the geographical and ethnical background of participants <b>by</b> <b>controlling</b> for what is called population stratification.|$|E

5|$|Spoken {{language}} {{relies on}} human physical {{ability to produce}} sound, which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the ear drum. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box (larynx), and the upper vocal tract– the throat, the mouth, and the nose. <b>By</b> <b>controlling</b> the {{different parts of the}} speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.|$|E
5|$|The skins of {{cephalopods}} {{such as the}} octopus contain complex units, each {{consisting of}} a chromatophore with surrounding muscle and nerve cells. The cephalopod chromatophore has all its pigment grains in a small elastic sac, which can be stretched or allowed to relax {{under the control of}} the brain to vary its opacity. <b>By</b> <b>controlling</b> chromatophores of different colours, cephalopods can rapidly change their skin patterns and colours.|$|E
5|$|Vainglory is a {{video game}} {{developed}} and published by Super Evil Megacorp for iOS and Android devices. The game is a simplified version of the PC-based MOBA genre wherein two opposing teams of three players fight to destroy the enemy base <b>by</b> <b>controlling</b> the path between the bases, which is lined by turrets and guarded by AI controlled enemy creatures. Off the path, players battle for control points that provide resources. The game was released for IOS in November 2014, after being soft-launched for over half a year, with the Android version being released in July 2015.|$|E

5|$|Although a {{judicial}} system still existed in Buenos Aires, Rosas removed any independence the courts might have exercised, either <b>by</b> <b>controlling</b> appointments to the judiciary, or by circumventing their authority entirely. He {{would sit in}} judgement over cases, issuing sentences which included fines, service in the army, imprisonment, or execution. The exercise of state terror {{as a tool of}} intimidation was restricted to Rosas himself; his subordinates had no control over it. It was used against specific targets, rather than randomly. Terrorism was orchestrated rather than a product of popular zeal, was targeted for effect rather than indiscriminate. Anarchic demonstrations, vigilantism and disorderliness were antithetical to a regime touting a law and order agenda. Foreigners were exempted from abuses, as were people too poor or inconsequential to serve as effective examples. Victims were selected for their usefulness as tools of intimidation.|$|E
5|$|Beetles can be {{beneficial}} to human economics <b>by</b> <b>controlling</b> the populations of pests. The larvae and adults of some species of lady beetles (Coccinellidae) feed on aphids that are pests. Other lady beetles feed on scale insects, whitefly and mealybugs. If normal food sources are scarce, they may feed on small caterpillars, young plant bugs, or honeydew and nectar. Ground beetles (Carabidae) are common predators of many insect pests, including fly eggs, caterpillars, and wireworms. Ground beetles can help to control weeds by eating their seeds in the soil, reducing the need for herbicides to protect crops. The effectiveness of some species in reducing certain plant populations {{has resulted in the}} deliberate introduction of beetles in order to control weeds. For example, the genus Zygogramma is native to North America but has been used to control Parthenium hysterophorus in India and Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Fellow {{players on}} the Italian {{national}} team nicknamed Pirlo l'architetto ("the Architect"), {{because of the way}} in which he buildt plays, and set up goal-scoring opportunities with long, lobbed through passes. In later seasons, Juventus fans also dubbed him il professore ("the professor"), Maestro, and Mozart, as a reference to the Austrian composer's prodigious ability. Pirlo was also frequently compared to fellow former Milan and Italy playmaker Demetrio Albertini early in his Milan career, due to their similar characteristics and style of play. Pirlo was often thought to be Albertini's heir for Milan and the national side; he inherited his nickname the metronome whilst playing at Milan, for the way in which he influenced games <b>by</b> <b>controlling</b> the tempo of his team's play through his direct and efficient passing game in midfield, as well as his ability to make himself available to teammates to receive and distribute the ball.|$|E
