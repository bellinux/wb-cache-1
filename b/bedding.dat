5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures {{have been shown to}} disrupt continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, <b>bedding,</b> and pillows, and eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|During the floods, {{flow through}} the narrow Wallula Gap was {{restricted}} such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis, which formed in the lowlands of the Columbia Plateau. Lake Lewis backflooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River valleys. This flooding lasted {{for a period of}} 4–7 days. In the relatively calm arms of the lake, the slack waters were thick with suspended materials eroded from the scablands above. Some of the suspended materials settled out, creating thick Touchet Formation layers, or rhythmites, which are found throughout these valleys. The larger clasts settled out first, followed by the finer ones. This resulted in layers with graded <b>bedding,</b> or <b>bedding</b> in which the larger particles are at the bottom and the smaller ones are at the top.|$|E
5|$|Other commercially {{valuable}} products from birds include feathers (especially the down of geese and ducks), {{which are used}} as insulation in clothing and <b>bedding,</b> and seabird faeces (guano), which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen.

5|$|A typical early 19th-century casual ward was {{a single}} large room {{furnished}} {{with some kind of}} <b>bedding</b> and perhaps a bucket {{in the middle of the}} floor for sanitation. The <b>bedding</b> on offer could be very basic: the Poor Law authorities in Richmond in the mid-1840s provided only straw and rags, although beds were available for the sick. In return for their night's accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of work before leaving the next day, such as at Guisborough, where men were required to break stones for three hours and women to pick oakum, two hours before breakfast and one after. Until the passage of the Casual Poor Act 1882 vagrants could discharge themselves before 11 am on the day following their admission, but from 1883 onwards they were required to be detained until 9 am on the second day. Those who were admitted to the workhouse again within one month were required to be detained until the fourth day after their admission.|$|E

5|$|At 2pm on Wednesday, March 21, the Spray {{collided}} with the Lucinda four miles north of Barnegat, New Jersey, knocking {{a hole in the}} Sprays bow that resulted in her filling with water; the Lucinda also sustained damage.

5|$|At Mare Island, Comfort had her boilers {{replaced}} and {{the electrical}} system was revamped, which entailed replacing all temporary wiring with permanent wiring and watertight fixtures. The crew {{quarters of the}} ship had also become infested with bedbugs from older German-style hospital <b>bedding</b> and remedies and eradication were performed.

5|$|Despite {{frequent}} derailments, {{low speed}} meant Wotton Tramway {{had a good}} safety record. The locomotives occasionally ran over stray sheep, and on 12September1888 sparks {{from one of the}} Aveling and Porter engines blew back into one of the train's cattle trucks, igniting the straw <b>bedding</b> and badly burning two cows. The line had one serious accident, in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by a locomotive near Church Siding and killed. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, absolving driver James Challis.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{economic}} uses, birds have been hunted for food since Palaeolithic times. They have been captured and bred as poultry to provide meat and eggs {{since at least the}} time of Ancient Egypt. Some species have been used, too, to help locate or to catch food, as with cormorant fishing and the use of honeyguides. Feathers have long been used for <b>bedding,</b> as well as for quill pens and for fletching arrows.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Margaret Chaloner, {{wife of the}} first Lord Gisborough, laid out formal gardens of a typical late-Victorian and Edwardian design with {{elaborate}} <b>bedding</b> schemes and gravelled paths.

5|$|Shrewsbury is twinned with Zutphen, Netherlands, a move {{inspired}} by the fact Sir Philip Sidney, an alumnus of Shrewsbury School, was fatally wounded there in 1586. At {{the end of the}} Second World War Shrewsbury's then Mayor, Harry Steward, who was made in 1946 an honorary citizen of Zutphen in return, launched an appeal for second-hand tools, clothes, <b>bedding</b> and other materials towards the town's post-war reconstruction after Nazi German occupation and war damage.|$|E
5|$|The Nama {{assemblage}} is best {{represented in}} Namibia. Three-dimensional preservation is most common, with organisms preserved in sandy beds containing internal <b>bedding.</b> Dima Grazhdankin believes that these fossils represent burrowing organisms, while Guy Narbonne maintains they were surface dwellers. These beds are sandwiched between units comprising interbedded sandstones, siltstones and shales – with microbial mats, where present, usually containing the fossils. The environment is interpreted as sand bars formed {{at the mouth}} of a delta's distributaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} this {{certainty}} was that the investigation was poorly conducted. The crime scene was not secured and searched thoroughly, and evidence was not recorded or preserved. Within a couple of days, the police had burned the bloodstained <b>bedding</b> and carpets, apparently to spare Bamber's feelings. The scenes-of-crime officer moved the murder weapon without wearing gloves, {{and it was not}} examined for fingerprints until weeks later. Three days after the killings, Bamber and the extended family were given back the keys to the house.|$|E
