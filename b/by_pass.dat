5|$|The depots and airbases {{depended}} on an efficient road network, so the engineers gave this a high priority. A major {{effort was made}} to bring the roads up to all-weather standard before onset of the 1942 wet season. New roads were also built. One of the first was the <b>By</b> <b>Pass</b> Road, which was designed to divert traffic from the main road, which ran around the south eastern end of Jackson Drome, and was therefore an operational hazard. The <b>By</b> <b>Pass</b> Road ran between Jackson and Wards Dromes, and was later extended to Berry, Schwimmer and Durand Dromes. The opening of the new wharf at Tatana Island in October caused a sudden jump in road traffic, so a new Barune Road was opened in November that provided a loop to Jackson and Wards Dromes. Fortunately, the local red shale contained clay and rock fragments, and when laid on a prepared subgrade and watered, either by sprinklers or rain, became hard like concrete. This could take motor vehicle traffic, although it became dusty when dry and slippery when wet. Surfacing material was obtained from the Nine Mile Quarry. Wood was found to be unsuitable for culverts, as it was quickly destroyed by the action of climate and insects. Oil drums were found to be superior, but they rusted, and using them for culverts depleted the drum supply.|$|E
5|$|The rival American Football League {{arose in}} 1960 and {{challenged}} the NFL's dominance. The AFL began in relative obscurity but eventually thrived, {{with an initial}} television contract with the ABC network. The AFL's existence forced the conservative NFL to expand to Dallas and Minnesota {{in an attempt to}} destroy the new league. Meanwhile, the AFL introduced many new features to Professional Football in the United States: official time on the scoreboard clock, rather than on a watch in the referee's pocket, as the NFL did; optional two-point conversions <b>by</b> <b>pass</b> or run after touchdowns; names on the jerseys of players; and several others, including expansion of the role of minority players, actively recruited by the league in contrast to the NFL. The AFL also signed several star college players that had also been drafted by NFL teams. Competition for players heated up in 1965, when the AFL New York Jets signed rookie Joe Namath to a then-record US$437,000 contract. A five-year, $40million NBC television contract followed, which helped to sustain the young league. The bidding war for players ended in 1966, when NFL owners approached the AFL regarding a merger, and the two leagues agreed on one that would take full effect in 1970. This agreement provided for a common draft that would take place each year, and it instituted an annual World Championship game to be played between the champions of each league. That game began play {{at the end of the}} 1966 season. Once the merger was completed, it was no longer a championship game between two leagues, and reverted to the NFL championship game, which came to be known as the Super Bowl.|$|E

25|$|This {{sediment}} then {{enters the}} coastal system and is transported by longshore drift. A {{good example of}} the sediment budget and longshore drift working together in the coastal system is inlet ebb-tidal shoals, which store sand that has been transported by long shore transport. As well as storing sand these systems may also transfer or <b>by</b> <b>pass</b> sand into other beach systems, therefore inlet ebb-tidal shoal systems provide a good sources and sinks for the sediment budget.|$|E
25|$|On 9 May, large rocks {{fell into}} the valley once again, burying the railway tracks for 250 metres and also making the road along the valley impassable. Moreover, the {{alluvial}} fan dammed up the Vispa, causing {{the lower part of}} the hamlet slowly to become flooded. After heavy rains on 18 Juny 1991, the station was similarly left under water. Planning immediately began for a new route for rail and road that would <b>by</b> <b>pass</b> the disaster area. The new rail alignment, totalling 2860 m, was ready to be opened on 1 August 1991. However, a heavy thunderstorm on 8 August led to a blockage of the newly excavated river channel of the Vispa by washed up glacial rubble, which meant a second flooding of the station. After the water had flowed away to a sufficient extent, the rail traffic could once again be resumed on 10 August.|$|E
2500|$|Penetration in attack- {{the forward}} or through pass: To the footballer, the {{penetration}} pass {{is one of}} the first methods learned in attack, whether it be the simple [...] "kick and chase" [...] of the youth leagues, or the exquisite through-balls by today's world class stars. Penetration <b>by</b> <b>pass</b> is the quickest method of advancing the ball towards the enemy goal. When well executed, it can yield spectacular results. Penetration in attack however requires more than mere passing. Players without the ball must move into space, and must time their runs so as not to be caught offside.|$|E
