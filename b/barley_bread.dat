5|$|Marshmallow fluff, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{ingredients}} of a Fluffernutter, was invented in the early 20th century. Archibald Query invented a creation he called Marshmallow Creme in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1917, while Amory and Emma Curtis of Melrose, Massachusetts, invented Snowflake Marshmallow Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for the Liberty Sandwich, which consisted of peanut butter and Snowflake Marshmallow Creme on oat or <b>barley</b> <b>bread.</b> The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918 and may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich. Earlier labels and booklets published by the Curtises suggested combining Snow Flake Marshmallow Creme with peanut butter or eating it on sandwiches with chopped nuts or olives.|$|E
5|$|Medieval {{society was}} highly stratified. In {{a time when}} famine was commonplace and social {{hierarchies}} were often brutally enforced, food was an important marker of social status {{in a way that}} has no equivalent today in most developed countries. According to the ideological norm, society consisted of the three estates of the realm: commoners, that is, the working classes—by far the largest group; the clergy, and the nobility. The relationship between the classes was strictly hierarchical, with the nobility and clergy claiming worldly and spiritual overlordship over commoners. Within the nobility and clergy there were also a number of ranks ranging from kings and popes to dukes, bishops and their subordinates, such as priests. One was expected to remain in one's social class and to respect the authority of the ruling classes. Political power was displayed not just by rule, but also by displaying wealth. Nobles dined on fresh game seasoned with exotic spices, and displayed refined table manners; rough laborers could make do with coarse <b>barley</b> <b>bread,</b> salt pork and beans and were not expected to display etiquette. Even dietary recommendations were different: the diet of the upper classes was considered to be as much a requirement of their refined physical constitution as a sign of economic reality. The digestive system of a lord was held to be more discriminating than that of his rustic subordinates and demanded finer foods.|$|E

40|$|Background : An {{increase}} in {{blood sugar levels}} after meals {{is the most common}} disorder in diabetes. Since bread {{is one of the main}} sources of food in Iran, we aimed to assesses the effect of five types of Iranian bread (Baguette, Lavash, Tafton, Sangak and Barley) on blood glucose level of type 2 diabetes patients and healthy subjects. Materials and Methods: In this study, 150 participants including two equal groups of type 2 diabetic patients with diabetes and healthy controls were studied. Both groups of patients and controls randomly divided into five equal subgroups, and then each group received one of the five kinds of bread containing 50 g available carbohydrate. Blood glucose level was measured at baseline, 60 and 120 minutes after consumption of breads. Results: Results showed that the highest glycemic response was observed in blood sugar after ingestion of Baguette bread, in both groups. The variations of blood glucose after 120 min, in subjects who had received Sangak and <b>Barley</b> <b>breads</b> was significantly lower than those who consumed Baguette, Lavash and Tafton breads (P < 0. 01). Conclusion: Sangak and <b>Barley</b> <b>breads</b> had more effec on blood glucose control, which can play an important role  in the regulation of blood glucose levels  in diabetic patients...|$|R

5|$|As {{far back}} as the Iron Age, Welsh folk were using wild cereals to create a coarse bread. By the time the Romans invaded, Celtic skills with bread had progressed to the point that white or brown breads could be produced. The Roman {{invasion}} led to many Welsh people moving to the less hospitable uplands, where the only cereal crops which could be grown were oats, barley and rye. Oat and <b>barley</b> <b>breads</b> were the main breads eaten in Wales up until the 19th century, with rye bread created for medicinal purposes. Oats were used to bulk out meat or meat and vegetable stews, also known as pottage.|$|R
50|$|Horsebread was a type {{of bread}} {{sometimes}} consumed in medieval Europe. This bread was, at the time, considered a low-quality bread, made from legumes such as dry split peas as well as or instead of grains, {{and was one of}} the cheapest breads available. It was fed to horses but also eaten in times of famine by the indigent and those who could not afford white bread (which was the most labour-intensive, and therefore expensive, bread) or other breads like rye or <b>barley</b> <b>breads.</b> White breads were generally only eaten by the wealthy, because of the labor involved in refining flour and because of the lower nutritional content. This is in contrast with modern whole grain breads, which are typically seen as premium-priced health foods or gourmet foods. This is in part because modern flour has a higher gluten content than flour produced in medieval Europe, and thus bread made from less refined flour is more palatable than it would have been during the Middle Ages.|$|R
25|$|In ancient Mesopotamia, clay tablets {{indicate}} {{that the majority of}} brewers were probably women, and that brewing was a fairly well respected occupation during the time, being the only profession in Mesopotamia which derived social sanction and divine protection from female deities/goddesses, specifically: Ninkasi, who covered the production of beer, Siris, who was used in a metonymic way to refer to beer, and Siduri, who covered the enjoyment of beer. Mesopotamian brewing appears to have incorporated the usage of a twice-baked <b>barley</b> <b>bread</b> called bappir, which was exclusively used for brewing beer. It was discovered early that reusing the same container for fermenting the mash would produce more reliable results; brewers on the move carried their tubs with them.|$|E

2500|$|The late-19th-century German biblical scholar Julius Wellhausen {{conceived}} of early Israelite religion as linked to nature's annual cycle {{and believed that}} Scripture only later connected the festivals to historical events like the Exodus from Egypt. Professor James Kugel of Bar Ilan University reported that modern scholars generally agreed that Passover reflects two originally separate holidays arising out of the annual harvest cycle. One Festival involved the sacrificing and eating of an animal from the flock, the pesa sacrifice, which arose among shepherds who sacrificed {{in the light of}} the full moon of the month that marked the vernal equinox and the end of winter (as directed in [...] ) to bring Divine favor for a safe and prosperous summer for the rest of the flock. The shepherds slaughtered the animal at home, as the rite also stipulated that some of the animal's blood be daubed on the doorposts and lintel of the house (as directed in [...] ) to ward off evil. The rite prescribed that no bone be broken (as directed in [...] ) so as not to bring evil on the flock from which the sacrifice came. Scholars suggest that the name pesa derived from the verb that means “hop” (as in [...] and [...] ), and theorize that the holiday may originally have involved some sort of ritual “hopping.” A second Festival – the Festival of Unleavened Bread – involved farmers eating unleavened <b>barley</b> <b>bread</b> for seven days when the winter's barley crop had reached maturity and was ready for harvest. Farmers observed this Festival with a trip to a local sanctuary (as in [...] and [...] ). Modern scholars believe that the absence of yeast in the bread indicated purity (as in [...] ). The listing of Festivals in [...] and [...] appear to provide evidence for the independent existence of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. Modern scholars suggest that the farmers' Festival of Unleavened Bread and the shepherds' Passover later merged into a single festival, Passover moved from the home to the Temple, and the combined festival was explicitly connected to the Exodus (as in [...] ).|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. White, brown, and black sorghum brans, wheat bran, and a waxy barley flour were each substituted for 0 - 30 % of wheat flour in a bread formula. Each of the brans were then combined with the barley flour and substituted for a total of 20 - 25 % of the wheat flour in the bread formula. The brans and barley flour were analyzed for dietary fiber, phenols, tannins, anthocyanins, and ORAC values. Effects of substitutions on bread qualities were evaluated and optimum levels of use were determined. All the brans contained similar levels of dietary fiber (41 - 48 %). The brown sorghum bran was highest in tannins, phenols, and ORAC value, and the black sorghum bran was highest in anthocyanins. The barley flour contained significantly less dietary fiber (13. 9 %) and higher levels of ?-glucans (4. 4 %) than the brans. More than 15 % brown or black sorghum bran in the bread formula significantly reduced specific volumes. Interactions between tannins in the brown sorghum bran and gluten proteins, and puncturing of air cells by sharp glume fragments in the black sorghum bran were determined to adversely affect dough structure. The optimum usage level of 15 % was chosen for the brans based on bread qualities and dietary fiber levels (~ 3 g/serving). Brown and black sorghum brans added significant levels of antioxidants/phenolic compounds to the bread and gave a dark brown color. The optimum level of 20 % barley flour in the bread added significant levels of soluble fiber (0. 9 g/serving), minimally affected color, and did not contribute excessive chewiness. Acceptability scores for 20 % <b>barley</b> flour <b>bread</b> were not significantly different from those for wheat bran or non-waxy <b>barley</b> flour <b>bread.</b> Breads containing the optimum combinations of 10 % barley flour/ 10 % bran had specific volumes similar to those for 15 % bran and 20 % <b>barley</b> flour <b>breads,</b> and were good sources of total (~ 3 g/serving) and soluble dietary fiber (0. 7 g/serving). Those with brown or black sorghum bran were significantly higher in phenolic compounds. The use of sorghum brans and <b>barley</b> flour in <b>bread</b> adds soluble and insoluble dietary fiber as well as antioxidants. Breads containing these beneficial ingredients could be promoted as nutraceuticals or functional foods...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Barley</b> and <b>bread</b> wheat show large {{differences}} in frequencies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) as determined from genome-wide studies. These frequencies have been estimated as 2. 4 - 3 times {{higher in the}} entire barley genome than within each diploid genomes of wheat (A, B or D). However, barley SNPs within individual genes occur significantly more frequently than quoted. Differences between wheat and barley {{are based on the}} origin and evolutionary history of the species. Bread wheat contains rarer SNPs due to the double genetic ‘bottle-neck’ created by natural hybridisation and spontaneous polyploidisation. Furthermore, wheat has the lowest level of useful SNP-derived markers while barley is estimated to have the highest level of polymorphism. Results: Different strategies are required for the development of suitable molecular markers in these cereal species. For example, SNP markers based on high-throughput technology (Infinium or KASP) are very effective and useful in both <b>barley</b> and <b>bread</b> wheat. In contrast, Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequences (CAPS) are more widely and successfully employed in small-scale experiments with highly polymorphic genetic regions containing multiple SNPs in barley, but not in wheat. However, preliminary ‘in silico’ search databases for assessing the potential value of SNPs have yet to be developed. Conclusions: This mini-review summarises results supporting the development of different strategies for the application of effective SNP and CAPS markers in wheat and barley. Yuri Shavruko...|$|R
