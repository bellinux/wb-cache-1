For little more than a decade, between 1954 and 1965, the magazine railed at the state of British theatre, championing work that it saw as standard-bearing for the experimental, challenging, vital theatre it sought. It was not an ideologically-driven magazine; it was not consistent; it admired the Royal Court, Theatre Workshop, Ionesco, Arden, and Tynan, and it often attacked all of these. But it had passion and it had curiosity. Its standards were invariably high. It knew what it wanted.We’ve named this site after Encore. We’re not reviving the magazine <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> can revive its spirit. [...] Articles published in the original Encore have been reprinted in a volume entitled The Encore Reader: A Chronicle of New Drama.

40|$|Selfish genes {{demonstrate}} transmission {{bias and}} invade sexual populations despite conferring no benefit to their hosts. While the molecular genetics and evolutionary dynamics of selfish genes are reasonably well characterized, {{their effects on}} hosts are not. Homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) are one well-studied family of selfish genes that {{are assumed to be}} benign. However, we show that carrying HEGs is costly for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, demonstrating that these genetic elements are not necessarily benign <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> parasitic. <b>We</b> estimate a selective load of approximately 1 - 2 in 'natural' niches. The second aspect we examine is the ability of HEGs to affect hosts' sexual behaviour. As all selfish genes critically rely on sex for spread, then any selfish gene correlated with increased host sexuality will enjoy a transmission advantage. While classic parasites are known to manipulate host behaviour, we are not aware of any evidence showing a selfish gene is capable of affecting host promiscuity. The data presented here show a selfish element may increase the propensity of its eukaryote host to undergo sex and along with increased rates of non-Mendelian inheritance, this may counterbalance mitotic selective load and promote spread. Demonstration that selfish genes are correlated with increased promiscuity in eukaryotes connects with ideas suggesting that selfish genes promoted the evolution of sex initially.

50|$|The year 2006 {{marked the}} centennial of this {{long-lasting}} association, which has always been dynamic and young. The strongest symbol of the club’s continuity is the annual Canadian Alpine Journal, “the oldest and most respected publication {{of its kind in}} the country”. The Canadian Alpine Journal was established only a year after the ACC had its first general meeting and has been published over 90 times in the last century. According to the ACC website, the journal provides the reader with “articles and images that reflect the ways that Canadians approach mountain culture, history, sport and science”. The Journal was and still is published every year, collecting route descriptions, records of adventures, mountain photography, geographical and natural science observations, poems, songs, cartoons and obituaries remembering Club members. Whilst the Journal is an annual publication, the Club also publishes The Gazette, a newsletter released three times a year, one for the spring, summer and winter season. The year 2006 saw the publication of the Centennial Gazette, a special issue celebrating the one hundredth anniversary of the ACC. In the ceremony’s opening speech, Mike Mortimer, the Club president in 2006 declared: “Clearly the Centennial was an opportunity to look towards the future - we knew where we came from but what about where we are going? Obviously we would not have the hubris to plan the next century, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> would be in a position to examine the guidelines set by our founding members and see if the cornerstones, that had been laid in Winnipeg and which had served us so well in the previous century, could do the same in the next century”. It is however undeniable that the club has expanded its activities, relentlessly growing over the last century. The ACC is now responsible for the largest public backcountry hut system in North America and proposes trips opportunities around the world.|$|E

Being deep {{in the study of}} the missional church, I suggested that the ministerial association ought to think about some sort of unified mission in the community of Wessington Springs where we serve. Immediately the United Methodist pastor shared with us his idea for holding a Saturday-night worship in the park during the summer months. We seemed to agree that none of our churches would probably be able to pull off something like that on our own, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> together <b>we</b> might be able to make it work. The prospect intrigued me. Ecumenical/community worship services are nothing new for this town of 1000 (there are at least four per year), but to hold a regular weekly service throughout the summer? That was a new one! The idea also provoked a number of questions for me. Two (or rather, two sets) in particular form the basis of this paper. First, what is it about worship that would make it the first thing pastors would think about when looking for a mission opportunity? Secondly, while I had been thinking of researching missional worship, i. e., how might a “missional church ” worship that would be different from one that is not, I began to wonder: what would an ecumenical “missional worship service ” look like?
