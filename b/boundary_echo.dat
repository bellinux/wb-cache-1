The study trained the binary logistic regression model by correlating the pathological results with the computerized features as a CAD system. When utilizing acoustic class features to construct CAD systems, the area indices under ROC curves were 0. 80 and 0. 85, respectively, using conventional ultrasound and using spatial compound imaging. The area indices were 0. 95 and 0. 97, respectively, using all features in conventional US and that in spatial compound imaging.

40|$|The {{detection}} of defects with ultrasonic waves can be optimized if the ultrasonic wavelength lambda {{is comparable to}} the defect size d. This implements the other boundary conditions too: pulse length equal or bigger than 1. 5 lambda, sound beam diameter without focussing about 10 lambda, with focussing about lambda.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{nondestructive}} testing of large grained materials {{is limited by}} the ability of the detection process to distinguish the flaw signals from the backscattered grain <b>boundary</b> <b>echoes.</b> This coherent grain noise often masks the echo from inhomogeneities and defects in the material. Absorption and scattering effects further reduce the ultrasound energy leading to poor signal-to-noise ratio in the received signal. It is not possible to reduce the grain clutter by conventional time averaging techniques due to its coherent nature. Different algorithms utilizing the principles of frequency diversity and spatial diversity have been used in the past for signal-to-noise ratio enhancement. In NDE applications where the noise is primarily due to Rayleigh scattering, it can be shown that flaw detection can be improved significantly by merely bandpass filtering {{the lower part of the}} received wideband echo spectrum. Both theoretical and experimental results are presented to support this conclusion. The filtering technique is successfully tested on materials with different grain sizes. The main advantage of this method is its relative simplicity, which eliminates the need for sophisticated and computationally intensive signal processing algorithms. Furthermore, this technique allows simple hardware implementation for real-time applications. The optimal parameters, i. e., the center frequency and bandwidth of the bandpass filter are experimentally determined...|$|R

Only recently has it been used for maxillofacial imaging. Aims and Objectives: To evaluate the reliability of ultrasonography as an alternative tool in the diagnosis of swellings in the orofacial region. Materials and Methods: Ultrasonographic examination of 30 patients of both the sexes aged between 8 and 70 years with swelling in the orofacial region was conducted. Doppler investigation was done in some cases to evaluate the vascularity. The following six sonographic parameters were recorded: shape, <b>boundary</b> <b>echo,</b> internal echo, distribution of internal echoes, posterior wall echoes, and vascularity. Following the clinical and ultrasonographic diagnosis, the lesion was subjected to histopathological examination and a final diagnosis was made. The ultrasonographic diagnosis was correlated with the clinical and histopathological diagnosis. Results: A significant association was observed between both clinical and histopathological diagnosis and ultrasonographic diagnosis (contingency = 0. 888, P value = 0. 000).

The TVSS’s 360 -degree vertical imaging plane allows simultaneous identification of multiple volume scattering sources and their discrimination from backscatter at the sea surface or the seafloor. This imaging capability is used to construct a three-dimensional representation of a pelagic fish school near the bottom. Scattering layers imaged in the mixed layer and upper thermocline are attributed to assemblages of epipelagic zooplankton.

40|$|In her {{exploration}} {{of the role of}} personal relationships in transgressing religious and linguistic <b>boundaries,</b> Nicholson <b>echoes</b> the point made by Ailes (in the previous chapter) that language is both reflexive and constitutive of society and culture. In 'Florent et Octavien', the exotic locations in which much of the action takes place seem at first to function as a backdrop for a story whose focus is gender rather than religious or ethnic conflict — however, this strange cultural milieu allows for an {{exploration of}} gender norms by creating a context in which norms and mores can be set aside and different modes of interaction can be imagined, ones less constrained by the customs of contemporary society. Nicholson suggests that this work can be read as an ironic attack on the conventional languages of chivalry and romance, and possibly on the conventions of the crusade cycle itself. Here, religion serves as a stand-in for longstanding and unexplained hostility of any kind: actual differences between Christianity and Islam are characterized only in their adherents’ treatment of women. There is little sense of otherness in the depiction of the Saracen and references to polygamy are the only approximations of actual features of Islamic culture.

Utilizing this methodology, dynamic material properties of arterial structures, such as IMT and diameter, are measured in a standard region over successive image frames.

40|$|The {{major problem}} in an {{ultrasonic}} flaw detection system {{is the presence of}} microstructure noise (clutter) resulting from scattering at grain <b>boundaries.</b> Ultrasonic grain <b>echoes</b> are random in amplitude and arrival time and often interfere and mask the flaw echo. Grain echoes are stationary and correlated from scan to scan in the same propagation path. An effective method of decorrelating grain echoes can be achieved by changing the frequency from scan to scan, a method known as frequency diversity. In practice frequency diverse grain echoes can be obtained by transmitting a broadband echo through the materials and bandpass filtering the received echoes over many bands of frequencies. At any given time the outputs of bandpass filters are the features representing information related to flaw or grain echoes. Although these outputs are random, the statistics of flaws and grains echoes are different. This situation permits application of statistical pattern recognition using a Bayes classifier. Experimental data and computer simulation have confirmed that flaw and clutter echoes over different frequency bands have a Gaussian distribution with different covariance matrices. For this situation the Bayes classifier is quadratic and provides optimal flaw detection performance.

Many kinds of examinations; i. e, physical examination, liver function test of serum, liver biopsy, laparoscopy, roentogenological diagnosis and others were using for this purpose, but the diagnosis was unliable yet. Recently, the clinical application of radioisotope is remarkably advanced, and the scintiscanning {{is used as a}} standard tool for clinician. The advances of the ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus and techniques is also evident. In this paper the investigations were carried out by combinating method of ultrasonic diagnosis with hepatoscintigram. The excellent point of this method is to improve the weak points each other of the hepatoscintigram and ultrasonic diagnosis. By means of hepatoscintigram every large space occupying lesion (more than 2 - 3 cm in diameter) in liver can be seen but the depth and structure of the lesion can not be recognized, however the ultrasonic A-scope method is able to clarify the laters. Ultrasonic method is able to diagnose the character of the aimed occupying lesion, respectively. Generally, the continuous multiplying echo indicate the cancer tissue, the <b>boundary</b> wall <b>echo</b> is the cyst or abscess, and the gall stone is easily diagnosed at the same time. But the risk for over diagnosis is respective in two methods, the diagnosis by this combinating method must be carefull in considerations. Combinating method of ultrasonic A-scope with hepatoscintigram gave a good result for liver disease. But the nature of the echoes obtained various kind of livers tend to over-lap. Therefore it is difficult to remark the distinguished accuracy in all cases. The suitable frequency was 2. 25 MC and a barium titanate of 10 mm in diameter was used.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 64 - 69). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Eight volumes of radar data were used for the dual-Doppler analysis of a bow echo that occurred over southeast Texas on 17 June 1997 during the Texas A&M University Convection and Lightning experiment (TEXACAL). The bow echo formed along a stationary cold front and progressed quickly eastward through the dual-Doppler network. The storm system portrayed many features similar to conceptual models of bow echoes, such as a strong rear inflow jet which forms early and strengthens and extends rearward throughout the lifecycle of the bow echo. Distinct cyclonic and anticyclonic mesoscale vortices form along the northern and southern portions of the bow echo, respectively, in association with the strengthening rear inflow jet. One feature not shown in conceptual models of bow echoes however is a distinct, smaller-scale, cyclonic vortex present along the northern front edge of the bow echo. This vortex seems to have formed from the tilting and subsequent stretching of vorticity generated along an outflow boundary, associated with previous convection, which is intersecting the northern portion of the bow echo. This vortex is present before the mesoscale vortices become noticeable and seems to be driving the nearby flow field, particularly the rear inflow jet, associated with the bow echo. The fact that this vortex tends to be the reason for the bowing of this particular storm system and dominates its overall evolution highlights the importance of <b>boundaries</b> on bow <b>echoes.</b> This feature has yet to be reproduced by numerical models because of the homogeneous environment assumption which eliminates any kind of boundary in the environment around the bow echo.

40|$|This thesis brings {{together}} the two genres for which Nin {{has become so}} (in) famous: her autobiography and her erotica in what I have termed 'auto/erotica'. By reading her autobiography and her erotica in and against each other I attempt to explore her development of a feminine aesthetic, or 'womb writing' as a strategy of resistance with which to challenge dominant discourses of 'woman' and the 'feminine', and her exclusion from cultural production. Drawing {{on the work of}} Jacques Derrida, Helene Cixous, Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva, this thesis explores the role of the border in the cultural production of bodies and sexual difference within Western discourses of sexuality, with particular reference to the discourses of psychoanalysis, modernism and pornography/erotica. My focus is on the trope of the borderline within Nin's texts, which, I argue is less a marker of radical difference than a site of instability offering the possibility of 'other' or 'between' spaces of resistance. This study engages with the politics of gender and genre by drawing on various feminist rewritings of autobiographical theory and Jacques Derrida's 'The Law of Genre' and the Ear of the Other in order to explore the tension between the 'auto' (the selfsame) and the 'graphy' {{in the formation of the}} 'bio' and gender identity. I explore how the threat of the other within the selfsame, the tracing of the differance of desire, affects the generic self-identity of 'autobiography' and 'erotica' as representations of (sexual) identity. Nin utilises the radical instability of the autobiographical genre to put into question the 'genre' of gender identity, the gendering of genre and the undecidable border between the 'body' and the 'text', the 'life' and the 'work'. Drawing on various psychoanalytical feminist film theories of the female spectator and the masquerade I explore how Nin performs the 'feminine' or 'woman' of (male) Surrealist and mainstream heterosexual pornography/erotica in order to emphasise the gaps, to hold at a distance, the female from the feminine. The concern of this thesis is the 'ob/scene' margins of 'erotica' and the trace of 'otherness' that threatens the single and self-identical body/text. The 'outworks' or prefaces of Nin's work not only disrupt fixed generic <b>boundaries</b> but also <b>echo</b> the desiring subject's fantasy of gender identity, wholeness and unity. By drawing attention to the role of vision in the constitution of gendered subjectivity and the (re) production of the phallus as the primary signifier of desire, I explore how Nin's erotica undermines a position of phallic certainty by drawing attention to the out-of-sight spaces, of 'ob/scene' pleasures that disturb and disrupt the illusion of 'masculine' phallic mastery. I argue that it is in the 'inter view', this dialogue or movement between (at least) two genres - autobiography and erotica - that other possible representations might be glimpsed...|$|R
40|$|The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) {{is a new}} {{generation}} lidar and is the primary science payload for NASA's ICESat Mission. The GLAS design combines a 10 cm precision surface lidar with a sensitive dual wavelength cloud and aerosol lidar. GLAS will precisely measure the heights of the Earth's polar ice sheets, establish a grid of accurate height profiles of the Earth's land topography, and profile the vertical distribution of clouds and aerosols on a global scale. GLAS will be integrated onto a small spacecraft built by Ball Aerospace, and will be launched into a polar orbit with a 590 - 630 km altitude at an inclination of 94 degrees. ICESat is is currently planned to launch in winter 2002 / 03 and GLAS is designed to operate continuously in space {{for a minimum of}} 3 years. GLAS will measure the vertical distance from orbit to the Earth's surface with pulses from a ND:YAG laser at a 40 Hz rate. Each 6 nsec wide 1064 nm laser pulse is used to produce a single range measurement. On the surface, the laser footprints have 66 m diameter and approx. 170 m center-center spacings. The GLAS receiver uses a I m diameter telescope to detect laser backscatter and a Si APD to detect the 1064 nm signals. The detector's output is sampled by a digital ranging receiver, which records each transmitted pulse and surface echo waveform with 1 nsec (15 cm) resolution. Each echo pulse is digitized and is reported to ground with a record length of from 200 to 544 samples, depending on the spacecraft's location. The GLAS location and epoch times are measured by a precision GPS receiver carried on the ICESat spacecraft. Initial processing of the echo waveforms within GLAS permits discrimination between cloud and surface echoes for selecting appropriate waveform samples. This selection is guided by an on-board DEM which is used to set the <b>boundaries</b> for the <b>echo</b> pulse search algorithm. Subsequent ground-based echo pulse analysis, along with GPS-based clock frequency estimates, permit final determination of the range to the surface, degree of pulse spreading, and vertical distribution of any vegetation illuminated by the laser. Accurate knowledge of the laser beam's pointing angle is needed to prevent height biases when measuring over tilted surfaces, such as near the boundaries of ice sheets. For surfaces with 2 deg. slopes, knowledge of pointing angle of the beam's centroid angle to better than 10 urad is needed. GLAS uses a stellar reference system (SRS) to measure the pointing angle of each laser firing relative to inertial space. The SRS uses a high precision star camera oriented toward local zenith and a gyroscope to determine the inertial orientation of the SRS optical bench. The far field pattern of each laser is measured pulse relative to the star camera with a laser reference system (LRS). GLAS will also measure the vertical distributions of clouds and aerosols by recording the vertical profiles of laser pulse backscatter at both 1064 and 532 nm. The 1064 rim measurements use the Si APD detector and will be used to measure the height and echo pulse shape from thicker clouds. The lidar receiver at 532 nm uses a narrow bandwidth etalon filter and highly sensitive photon counting detectors. The 532 nm backscatter profiles will be used to measure the vertical extent of thinner clouds and the atmospheric boundary layer. The GLAS instrument component development is complete and the instrument is undergoing final testing and qualification at NASA-Goddard. The GLAS "as-built" characteristics and its expected measurement performance will be discussed...|$|R
