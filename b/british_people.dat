5|$|During Sophia's lifetime, {{there were}} various rumours about her alleged incestuous {{relationship}} with her brother, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, who later became the King of Hanover. The Prince Regent supposedly warned his sisters not to be alone {{in the same room}} with the Duke, and Cumberland was deeply unpopular with the <b>British</b> <b>people.</b> It is unclear whether there was truth to these rumours or whether they were circulated by the Duke's numerous political enemies.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{when the}} British {{declared}} {{war against the}} Zulu Kingdom in Natal, Gandhi at age 36, sympathised with the Zulus, and encouraged the Indian volunteers to help as an ambulance unit. He argued that Indians should participate in the war efforts to change attitudes and perceptions of the <b>British</b> <b>people</b> against the coloured people. Gandhi, a group of 20 Indians and black people of South Africa volunteered as a stretcher-bearer corps to treat wounded British soldiers and {{the opposite side of}} the war: Zulu victims.|$|E

5|$|The Referendum Party was a Eurosceptic, single-issue {{political}} party that {{was active in}} the United Kingdom from 1994 to 1997. The party's sole objective was for a referendum to be held {{on the nature of the}} UK's membership of the European Union (EU). Specifically, it called for a referendum on whether the <b>British</b> <b>people</b> wanted to either be part of a federal European state or revert to being a sovereign nation that was part of a free-trade bloc without wider political functions.|$|E
5|$|The disdain of the <b>British</b> <b>people</b> for the Boers was {{recorded}} {{as early as}} the 18th century. The Boers were portrayed to the British public in literature and editorial cartoons as uncivilised and cruel, especially in order to obtain the support of the British public for British imperialism and the Second Boer War. The English term Boer-hater was used in a political context in the British Cape Colony as early as 1889, referring to persons opposing Cape Dutch interests, the use of their language in Parliament in particular.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{significant}} percentage of ethnic group colony residents. The most numerous communities are Croatian, Italian, Greek, Chinese, Arabic nationalities, Peruvians and Bolivians, <b>British</b> <b>peoples</b> (i.e. Scots), and the French.|$|R

5|$|These {{terms were}} {{initially}} applied to <b>British</b> <b>people</b> perceived as prejudiced against the Boers, {{in the context}} of political conflict between the British and the Boers in southern Africa which culminated in the British defeat of the Boers in the Second Boer War. Accusations of Boerehaat have subsequently been made by Afrikaner nationalists to exploit historical British prejudice against the Boers for political gain. They have applied the term Boerehater to anyone who criticised them or opposed their interests in the Cape Colony, including English-speaking white South Africans, dissident Afrikaners and black South Africans.|$|E
5|$|George V's {{death in}} 1936 was {{followed}} by the accession of Edward VIII, who caused a public scandal by announcing his desire to marry the divorced American Wallis Simpson, even though the Church of England opposed the remarriage of divorc√©es. Accordingly, Edward announced his intention to abdicate; the Parliaments of the United Kingdom and of other Commonwealth countries granted his request. Edward VIII and any children by his new wife were excluded from the line of succession, and the Crown went to his brother, George VI. George served as a rallying figure for the <b>British</b> <b>people</b> during World War II, making morale-boosting visits to the troops as well as to munitions factories and to areas bombed by Nazi Germany. In June 1948 George VI relinquished the title Emperor of India, although remaining head of state of the Dominion of India.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the British {{government}} {{comes under}} public pressure {{to resolve the}} problem. It becomes clear to the British diplomats assigned {{to find a solution}} that defeating the Burgundians through starvation is both difficult and unpopular with the <b>British</b> <b>people,</b> so they negotiate. The sticking point {{turns out to be the}} disposition of the unearthed treasure. Wix, now the Burgundian Chancellor of the Exchequer, suggests a Burgundian loan of the treasure to Britain. With the final piece of the deadlock eliminated, Burgundy reunites with Britain, which also sees the return of rationing for food and clothing to the area. The celebratory outdoor banquet is interrupted by heavy rain.|$|E
5000|$|Beattie disbanded the National Socialist Party in 1978. Soon {{after he}} and John Ross Taylor co-founded the {{short-lived}} <b>British</b> <b>People's</b> League. In both 1988 and 1989, Beattie organized [...] "Aryan Fest" [...] parties on his property in Minden, Ontario.|$|R

50|$|In Great Britain, {{a number}} of small far-right parties have and still do express support for loyalist paramilitaries, and loyalism in general.

5|$|Motives for {{collection}} of articles, such as Tipu's Tiger, are seen by literary historian Barrett Kalter {{as having a}} social and cultural context. The {{collection of}} Western and Indian art by Tipu Sultan is seen by Kalter as motivated {{by the need to}} display his wealth and legitimise his authority over his subjects who were predominantly Hindu and did not share his religion, viz. Islam. In the case of the East India Company, collection of documents, artefacts and objet's d'art from India helped develop the idea of a subjugated Indian populace {{in the minds of the}} <b>British</b> <b>people,</b> the thought being that the possession of such objects of a culture represented understanding of, dominance over, and mastery of that culture.|$|E
5|$|The <b>British</b> <b>people</b> {{returned}} Clement Attlee and his Labour Party {{later in}} July. Attlee and his Secretary of State for India, Lord Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, immediately ordered {{a review of}} the Indian situation. Jinnah had no comment on the change of government, but called a meeting of his Working Committee and issued a statement calling for new elections in India. The League held influence at the provincial level in the Muslim-majority states mostly by alliance, and Jinnah believed that, given the opportunity, the League would improve its electoral standing and lend added support to his claim to be the sole spokesman for the Muslims. Wavell returned to India in September after consultation with his new masters in London; elections, both for the centre and for the provinces, were announced soon after. The British indicated that formation of a constitution-making body would follow the votes.|$|E
5|$|The English {{people are}} a <b>British</b> <b>people.</b> Some genetic {{evidence}} suggests that 75‚Äì95% descend in the paternal line from prehistoric settlers who originally came from the Iberian Peninsula, {{as well as a}} 5% contribution from Angles and Saxons, and a significant Scandinavian (Viking) element. However, other geneticists place the Germanic estimate up to half. Over time, various cultures have been influential: Prehistoric, Brythonic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Viking (North Germanic), Gaelic cultures, as well as a large influence from Normans. There is an English diaspora in former parts of the British Empire; especially the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Since the late 1990s, many English people have migrated to Spain.|$|E

50|$|Within the NF, the Leicester branch {{had become}} one of the most active in the country and, since 1972, this group had been led by Anthony Reed Herbert, a local {{solicitor}} whose talent for organisation had made Leicester a model branch. Reed Herbert took the opportunity provided by the 1979 collapse of the NF to launch his own group, initially selecting the name <b>British</b> <b>Peoples</b> Party. However, the name was quickly changed in order to avoid association with the earlier <b>British</b> <b>People's</b> Party, a splinter group from the National Socialist League, organised either side of the Second World War. The name was thus changed to British Democratic Party even though a British Democratic Party, a minor right wing anti-communist group, had also previously existed in the 1930s.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>British</b> <b>People's</b> Party (not to be {{confused}} with the now defunct <b>British</b> <b>People's</b> Party (2015) which has no connection to previous groups) also known as [...] "BPP - Putting Britons First" [...] was the third incarnation of a name used by other neo-Nazi political parties in the United Kingdom. It was launched on 18 September 2005 by Kevin Watmough, Eddy Morrison, John G. Wood, and Sid Williamson as a splinter group from the Nationalist Alliance, following what they saw as the unacceptably slow progress of that movement. Its members are former members of Combat 18, British National Party (BNP), National Front (NF) and the White Nationalist Party. Its founding member Eddy Morrison left the BPP and joined the NF in 2009. The party dissolved in 2013.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901, {{officials}} at the Royal Mint planned for new coins, to bear {{the image of her}} son and successor, Edward VII. New coin designs had been introduced in the 1890s, and Mint officials believed the <b>British</b> <b>people</b> wanted as few changes to the coinage as possible. Thus, it was decided not to alter the reverses of the three bronze coins (the penny, halfpenny and farthing), as a new portrait of the Queen had been introduced in 1895. At that time, the Engraver of the Royal Mint, George William de Saulles, had modified Leonard Charles Wyon's depiction of Britannia on the reverse of the bronze coins‚Äîthe lighthouse and sailing ship that had flanked her were removed. De Saulles was tasked with creating a depiction of Edward for the King's new coinage. The Mint continued to strike coins depicting Victoria, dated 1901, until the King's coinage was ready in May 1902.|$|E
5|$|For George III, Pitt's {{appointment}} {{was a great}} victory. It proved {{that he was able}} to appoint Prime Ministers on the basis of his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords. During and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain. The <b>British</b> <b>people</b> admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife. He was fond of his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively. Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning, and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue. When his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.|$|E
5|$|Several {{popularity}} polls {{conducted over}} the past decade indicate that Freddie Mercury's reputation may, in fact, have been enhanced since his death. For instance, in a 2002 vote to determine who the UK public considers the greatest <b>British</b> <b>people</b> in history, Mercury was ranked 58 in the list of the 100 Greatest Britons, broadcast by the BBC. He was further listed at the 52nd spot in a 2007 Japanese national survey of the 100 most influential heroes. Despite {{the fact that he had}} been criticised by gay activists for hiding his HIV status, author Paul Russell included Mercury in his book The Gay 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Gay Men and Lesbians, Past and Present. In 2008 Rolling Stone ranked Mercury 18 on its list of the Top 100 Singers Of All Time. Mercury was voted the greatest male singer in MTV's 22 Greatest Voices in Music. In 2011 a Rolling Stone readers' pick placed Mercury in second place of the magazine's Best Lead Singers of All Time.|$|E

5000|$|The WNP under Morrison and John G. Wood courted John Tyndall, {{although}} he refused [...] to join {{as he did}} not feel that divisions were helpful.
