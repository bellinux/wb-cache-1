Nas narrates the tale in conventional fashion until the ending, at which the track rewinds to an earlier point and he revises his original ending. [...] "Everybody's Crazy" [...] features complex rhymes and braggadocio rap by Nas: [...] "Gangsta see, gangsta do / A Langston Hughes predecessor / Gun in my dresser, slang I use." [...] In [...] "Purple"s narrative, Nas lights up a blunt and expresses his thoughts, including criticism of hoodlums and their effect on their neighborhoods: [...] "The 'hood love you, but <b>behind</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> they pray for the day / A bullet hit your heart and ambulance take you away / That ain't love it's hate / Think of all the mothers at wakes / Whose sons you've killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?"

2500|$|In June 2013, Beck {{announced}} the expected release {{of two new}} albums for 2014, {{with one of the}} two being an [...] "acoustic" [...] album. The press release for the [...] "acoustic" [...] album (along with the news of his contract with Capitol Records) arrived in October 2013, announcing the title as Morning Phase and giving a February, 2014 release window. The other still-unfinished album would be planned for a later release. In comparing the production of Morning Phase with his previous album, Beck stated that prior to recording Modern Guilt in 2008, he had suffered a serious spinal injury, and that the recording process for Modern Guilt was like [...] "doing it with both hands tied <b>behind</b> <b>your</b> <b>back.</b> It hurt to sing. I'm whispering through half of those vocals." [...] On the other hand, Beck said that Morning Phase was a much more satisfying experience: [...] "Some of the songs on the new record – I get to shout and yell. I'm like, 'Thank you!' I had a lot of ideas and things I'd been wanting to do. This last year and a half, I feel like I can really do them." ...|$|E

That was as good scouting as ever I have seen, and we've got some Scouts up where I come from. They can do stunts in the woods that probably would make you fellows green with envy if you could see them. If you were to come up there in the woods I expect that they would laugh at you <b>behind</b> <b>your</b> <b>backs,</b> just as you would laugh at them if they should come down here. As nearly as I can make out {{that seems to be the}} way with the world--to laugh at others who happen to be different in speech or ways or dress. You city boys call a country boy a rube and green just because his ways are different from your ways and he isn't wise to the things that you are. He thinks just the same way of you when you visit him in the country. What I have seen to-day has taught me a lesson. Out in the woods I know just what to do, how to do it and when to do it, no matter what happens. When I started out with you to-day I smiled down inside at the idea of you being able to show me anything in the way of scouting. I wished I had the Bull Moose Patrol here to show you what real scouting is like.|$|R

After you have reached or surpassed the vertical position, lower your body until the bottom of your shoulder blades touch the ground. Your head, hands, arms, or elbows do not have to touch the ground. At the end of each repetition, the scorer will state the number of sit-ups you have correctly completed.

If a repetition does not count, the scorer will repeat the number of your last correctly performed sit-up. The up position is the only authorized rest position. If you stop and rest in the down (starting) position, the event will be terminated. As long as you make a continuous physical effort to sit up, the event will not be terminated. You may not use your hands or any other means to pull or push yourself up to the up (resting) position or to hold yourself in the rest position. If you do so, your performance in the event will be terminated. Correct performance is important. You will have two minutes to perform as many sit-ups as you can.".|$|R
