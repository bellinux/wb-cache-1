50|$|The {{cable-stayed}} bridge with its 112 metre tall tower, is a landmark structure for Waterford City and surrounding areas. The tower is constructed {{on the south}} side of the river. A series of “stay cables” fan out from the top of the tower to support the main span at intervals of about 10 metres. Corresponding cables fan to the back spans using the weight of the <b>back</b> <b>span</b> and anchor piles to balance the forces and “keep the tower standing straight”.|$|E

50|$|The Qianximen Bridge (sometimes Qiansimen Bridge) {{crosses the}} Jialing River with a {{cable-stayed}} main span that is 312 m, connecting the Jiangbei and the Yuzhong Districts. The {{placement of the}} single tower means that the cable-stayed <b>back</b> <b>span</b> of 240 m provides a secondary channel for shipping. The bridge has a total length of 720 m as it includes girder spans of 88 m and 80 m. The bridge has nine pairs of cables. The Qianximen Bridge has the longest stay cable of both bridges, measuring 256.85 m long. The bridge was shortlisted for an award by the Institution of Structural Engineers.|$|E

50|$|The Smaalenene Bridge {{has become}} a new {{landmark}} for the region. The cable-stayed bridge is 315m long in total and spans the River Glomma {{as part of the}} new E18 link 80 km southeast of Oslo. It has a river clearance of 25m to the soffit of the deck and carries four lanes of traffic. The cable-stayed section consists of two spans with a single tower; the main span is 185m long and the <b>back</b> <b>span</b> has a length of 142.5m. A solid counterbalance abutment on the <b>back</b> <b>span</b> end was built to compensate the corresponding scope of works performed imbalance in dead load. A 45m-long approach span connects the cable-stayed part to the west abutment. The cable-stayed deck is supported by a single pylon via a central plane of 14 cables {{on each side of the}} tower. At deck level, the cables are anchored at 7m centers into a central beam that transfers the horizontal component of the stay’s force into the concrete deck through shear studs. The deck is 25m wide and is designed to carry two traffic lanes in each direction, separated by a 4.4mwide central reservation. Twenty-eight stay cables with individually galvanised, waxed and sheathed strands varying in size from 6-43 to 6-85 and in length from 40m to 126m. Forming the stay-cable bundle involved installing each individual strand one at a time and encapsulating them using an external HDPE pipe with double helical ribs.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} over 42 railway lines without disturbing railway traffic and is 284 metres long.There are two pylons, North and South, and are 42 and 27 metres respectively. Engineers {{tried to keep}} the bridge as light as possible and used a structural steel with a concrete composite deck to keep weight down. Heavier banks along the bridge were reinforced by heavier <b>back</b> <b>spans.</b> The bridge consists of two lanes and has pedestrian walk-ways on either side. The bridge can be viewed from one of Johannesburg's most popular roads, the M1 highway.|$|R
50|$|The 1958 {{steel bridge}} is a {{suspended}} deck through-arch truss bridge. The {{approach to the}} main span has elements of a through-truss bridge, but the arch shape takes the truss higher than the roadway deck, so hangers are used to suspend the deck from the arch truss. The 1958 bridge is 2560 m long overall. The main span of 151 m is flanked by two <b>back</b> <b>spans</b> each 83.7 m long; there are 72 total approach spans, and the bridge has 36.7 m of vertical clearance below {{the bottom of the}} deck.|$|R

50|$|The Kap Shui Mun Bridge is not symmetrical, in {{that the}} 160 m <b>back</b> <b>span</b> length (two 80 m spans) {{is less than half}} of the main span length (which would be 215 m). To provide the balance that {{symmetry}} will normally provide, part of the bridge has a composite structure. The center 387 m of the main span uses a steel-concrete composite to make the structure lighter. The back spans and the rest of the main span are concrete. Using the lighter steel cross section in the majority of the main span serves to equalize the horizontal forces on the towers and balance the bridge.|$|E
50|$|Work on {{the western}} {{highrise}} span was bid in October 1964 and commenced in 1965. It crosses a shipping channel, with an orthotropic main span that is 750 ft long (at the time, the longest girder span in the United States) and has a vertical clearance of 135 ft. The main span is flanked by two orthotropic back spans which are each 375 ft long, and there are seven orthotropic side spans on the approach to each <b>back</b> <b>span.</b> Each of these side spans are 292 ft long. Although these spans appear to be formed from continuous box girders, they consist of alternating anchor spans and suspended spans. Anchor spans rest on top of two adjacent piers and cantilever over each side slightly, and suspended spans are hung between the ends of two adjacent anchor spans. There are an additional nine 208 ft steel spans carrying a concrete deck on the San Mateo side of the highrise, and ten steel spans carrying a concrete deck on the Hayward side, ranging from 186 - 208 ft. The bridge carries about 93,000 cars and other vehicles on a typical day, almost double its original projected design capacity of 50,000 vehicles per day.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{existing}} Komurhan Bridge {{was built}} over the dam reservoir prior to water storage. The aging segmental post-tensioned concrete bridge with two lanes had an active sagging problem at its mid-span. As the traffic demand increased over the years, the authorities decided to add two more lanes to have a twin two-lane road for this part of highway network. Therefore, a need was developed {{to build a new}} bridge. Unlike the existing one, the suggested crossing needed to pass 300 meters wide water body with a depth of 45 meters to avoid piers at water body. Couple of alternatives was considered to cross the deep water at conceptual design phase. The focus of this study is given to the conceptual design of a cable-stayed bridge with two towers crossing the water at the narrowest location. This option results in a curved <b>back</b> <b>span</b> at one side of the water. A three-dimensional computer model was developed to assess challenges in design. Special care is given to the design details of the cables and the superstructure. Even if one of the back spans is curved, the proposed conceptual cable-stay bridge design is satisfactory under service and earthquake loads...|$|E
40|$|The rapid bloom of {{cable-stayed}} bridges {{has been}} propitiated {{by the development}} of erection techniques and improvements of construction materials. Nevertheless, the economic boom of the last decade has deflected attention from economic cost to iconic aesthetical appearance increasing significantly designer’s freedom. This structural freedom has enabled the proliferation of a number of non-symmetric cable-stayed bridges. Despite of the number of built examples, the analysis of non-symmetrical cable-stayed bridges has not received considerable attention from the researchers. In fact, the effects of the main design parameters in the structural behavior of these bridges are not addressed in detail in the literature.
