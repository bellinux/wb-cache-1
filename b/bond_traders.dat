By {{the middle of}} the 1970s, encouraged by the head of bond research at Salomon, Marty Liebowitz, traders began thinking about bond yields in new ways. Rather than think of each maturity (a ten-year bond, a five-year, etc.) as a separate marketplace, they began drawing a curve through all their yields. The bit nearest the present time became known as the short end—yields of bonds further out became, naturally, the long end.|$|E

50|$|Feeding Frenzy — The Friday-morning meal {{shared by}} a certain clique of <b>bond</b> <b>traders.</b> At this meal, traders would order astounding {{quantities}} of take-out food, far more than they could eat (e.g., a five-gallon tubs of guacamole with an order of $400 worth of Mexican food).

50|$|In 1991, the {{downtown}} Securities Custody Department {{moved to the}} World Financial Center with a new state-of-the-art trading room.

Shortly after, Iguchi was promoted to Executive VP of the New York Branch. In 1992, during a New York Fed examination, Daiwa concealed the trading operation in its downtown office from the examiners by relocating the <b>bond</b> <b>traders</b> to the Branch’s main office in midtown.|$|E

50|$|Mr. Maheras {{joined the}} high-yield desk at Salomon Brothers in 1984, shortly {{after graduating from}} Notre Dame. He ran the desk from 1989-1994, {{when he was asked}} to oversee the {{mortgage}} securities division. He became the head of the global fixed-income department in 1996. Mr. Maheras was widely credited with turning around Salomon's money-losing mortgage securities operation and became “one of the top two or three high-yield <b>bond</b> <b>traders</b> in all of Wall Street.

Lewis went through Salomon's training program and then became a bond salesman at Salomon Brothers in London.

50|$|On September 11, 2001 {{the firm}} which was {{headquartered}} on the 104th {{floor of the}} South Tower of the World Trade Center lost 66 of its 171 employees, 40 percent of its overall workforce.

In 1992 he started The Liscio Report, a financial newsletter that became influential on Wall Street and especially so among <b>bond</b> <b>traders.</b> Upon his death in 2000 the newsletter was continued by trusted associates Doug Henwood and Phillipa Dunne.|$|E
50|$|Another problem Lewis {{noticed was}} a large {{disconnect}} between what Salomon Brothers mortgage traders were paid, and what they believed {{they should have been}} paid. Ranieri and his fellow traders felt that, since their department generated so much money for the firm, they ought to receive considerably higher salaries and compensation. Gutfreund and other managers, on the other hand, argued that the traders were not risking their own money, but the firm's, and noted that the mortgage department spent years losing money before succeeding. Because of this disagreement, Salomon Brothers lost many of its traders when other firms that added mortgage bonds to their business began to offer higher salaries, easily luring the Salomon Brothers mortgage <b>bond</b> <b>traders</b> away.|$|E

5000|$|The {{response}} to the first Liberty Bond was unenthusiastic and although the $2 billion issue reportedly sold out, it probably {{had to be done}} below par because the notes traded consistently below par on the street. One reaction to this was to attack <b>bond</b> <b>traders</b> as [...] "unpatriotic" [...] if they sold below par. The Board of Governors of the New York Stock Exchange conducted an investigation of brokerage firms who sold below par to determine if [...] "pro-German influences" [...] were at work. The board forced one such broker to buy the bonds back at par and make a $100,000 donation to the Red Cross. Various explanations were offered for the weakness of the bonds ranging from German sabotage to the rich not buying the bonds because it would give an appearance of tax dodging (the bonds were exempt from some taxes).|$|E
