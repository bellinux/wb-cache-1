2500|$|In April 1815 the Regents Canal Company built {{a double}} caisson lock [...] (or [...] "hydro-pneumatic lock") {{at the site}} of the [...] present-day Hampstead Road Lock, north London.

Here the motivation was, principally, water supply problems but also to effect a quicker passage of vessels, as those going in opposite directions could pass in the lock. The caissons—always submerged, as at Coombe Hay—were without bottoms and were arranged so that their sides dropped into deep underwater channels formed by [...] "minor walls" [...] inside the main walls. The vertical movement of the two caissons was effected by a <b>balance</b> <b>pipe</b> ("the channel of communication") passing under the lock floor between the two caisson chambers (but with a slight upturn to reach above the water levels), so that causing an increase of water level in one caisson ("the water of compression") displaced air through the pipe, thus forcing a corresponding decrease in the water level in the other. This increased the buoyancy of the latter caisson, which accordingly rose as the first sank. A connecting underwater chain passing through rollers, while not in itself doing any work, controlled the relative positions. Boats were admitted through double gates; the inside ones on the caisson [...] "adjusted to fit close [...] to those of the outer".

However it was found the fastest overall time was six minutes and that the effort required rendered the operator [...] "incapable of further exertion". Furthermore, as the operation of the device depended upon air pressure inside the caissons (whether the means of moving them was by varying this air pressure or otherwise) when contractor Henry Maudslay delivered them and they were found to leak air, the scheme failed.

5000|$|Essentially a re-styled Triumph Bonneville, the [...] "West Coast" [...] styled TSX was {{distinguished}} by its lowered chassis and 16 in rear wheel {{with the engine}} off-set in the frame to accommodate this. Other changes, whilst unique to the model, were cosmetic including stepped seat, black finished engine with polished fins, re-styled passenger grabrail, shortened front and rear painted mudguards, the latter having a black plastic extension for the larger UK vehicle numberplate, chromed shorty megaphone exhausts with the crossover pipe hidden between them under the bike and flowing thru 1.75" [...] pipes, Morris alloy wheels (then made by Performance Machine) and 'retro' stick on graphics outlined in the usual gold hand pinstriping. Paioli rear suspension units, with plastic top shrouds, were sited at a more acute angle further back on the swinging arm to lower the seat height. A slightly lower rise and wider USA style handlebar was fitted and chromed Lucas turn indicators returned {{in place of the}} black plastic ULO items that had replaced them on other Triumph models from 1981. A chromed wire mounted Lucas headlamp with sealed beam was changed to the Lucas H4 early in the production run. A Brembo rear brake master cylinder was fitted in place of the usual Automotive Products (AP) Lockheed item which remained for the front, as well as supplying both calipers. Dual front discs were an option. Whilst the 1982-1983 brochure showed Goodyear Eagle tyres fitted, an Avon Roadrunner rear and Speedmaster front tyre went on production models, the tyres' lettering picked out in white. Although the German magazine Motorad road-tested a kick start-only version, the kickstart was an optional extra on the production TSX. The standard TSX engine was a T140ES (electric start) [...] with two 32-mm Bing carburettors and electronic ignition. The engine was offset to accommodate the fatter rear tyre within the frame which also necessitated a unique swingarm and abbreviated chromed chainguard. The engine also benefitted from an updated crank with more careful machining; the result being greatly reduced vibration. The TSX fuel tank was a unique design for the model having only one Paioli left hand petrol tap situated ahead to accommodate the larger Bing carburettors. This tank also had a centralised filler hole with optional locking cap and a <b>balance</b> <b>pipe</b> situated {{on the front of the}} tank's underside.|$|E

50|$|One {{characteristic}} of the locomotive was a design fault that caused it to derail. The problem would only occur when the locomotive was travelling smokebox first over facing hand operated points, usually {{to be found in}} colliery sidings, marshalling yards and the dock area. The rear coupled wheels, nearest the bunker, would force the tongue of the point open, causing the trailing bogie not to follow the driving wheels but to take the wrong road. These points had the disadvantage of not having a locking mechanism which could be found on facing points on the main line. At its worst, the result could be derailment, one example being that of No 147 which when entering Barry Sidings with a coal train from Coity, ended up on its side. Less severe but nonetheless serious damage could also be sustained. If the <b>balancing</b> <b>pipe</b> between the side and bunker tanks became fractured, the tanks would lose water rapidly and the fire would have to be dropped to prevent a boiler explosion. In practical terms, the crews would usually solve the problem by having the fireman hold on to the point lever while the driver took the locomotive through the point extremely slowly. Several engineering solutions were attempted both on the locomotive and on the track to overcome the problem but never fully successfully.|$|R

The study {{is based on}} a model-based analysis using the net present value (NPV) method, as well as Monte Carlo simulation for taking fuel and electricity price risks into account. We study three investment cases: a Base Case where the gas is directly sold, a Variant A where temporal arbitrage opportunities between the electricity and gas market are exploited, and a Variant B where the balancing markets (secondary reserve market for electricity, external balancing market for natural gas) are addressed. Centralized and decentralized storage facilities are compared with each other and the optimal type and size determined. In a detailed sensitivity analysis and cost analysis we identify the key factors which could potentially improve the economic viability of the concepts assessed. We find that P 2 G for bridging the balancing markets for power and gas cannot be operated profitably. For both temporal arbitrage and <b>balancing</b> energy, <b>pipe</b> storage is preferred. Relatively high feed-in tariffs (100 € MW- 1 for H 2, 130 € MW- 1 for methane) are required to render pipe storage for P 2 G economically viable...|$|R

40|$|Slug flow is a {{flow pattern}} {{existing}} at intermediate flow rates, or arising due to operating conditions or pipe topology. Typical slug flow is recognized by large gas bubbles flowing over a liquid film separated by liquid slug bodies with entrained gas bubbles covering the whole pipe diameter. The entrainment of gas requires an extra equation {{to be able}} to calculate the pressure drop of the flow. A good prediction of slug flows is needed in order to optimize the equipment sizing and operate multiphase transport pipelines in a best possible way. In this study, a two-dimensional, transient channel setup of gas entrainment was simulated using the CFD package Star-CCM+. In order to enable the study of the entrainment of gas at the slug front, a moving reference frame with the propagation velocity of a Taylor bubble was applied. The simulations showed that all the parameters studied in the study; pipe inclination, bubble propagation velocity and liquid film height and velocity all revealed changes in the gas entrainment. The gas entrainment was found to be influenced by the turbulent kinetic energy in the liquid slug arising from the shear between the liquid slug and the liquid film. Furthermore, a mechanistic <b>balance</b> for horizontal <b>pipes</b> was solved to enable the usage of models using the momentum exchange as a parameter when calculating the liquid holdup. Two models considering the momentum exchange between the liquid film and the slug body were compared to other, more simple models. The best prediction model was found to be the model based on a dimensionless momentum transfer rate. Both the simulations and the solving of a mechanistic balance for experimental values indicated that the momentum transfer rate at the slug front has an effect on the void fraction and gas entrainment. This effect may therefore {{be a good way to}} estimate the liquid holdup...|$|R
40|$|In power {{generation}} from solid fuel such as coal-fired power plants, combustion efficiency can be {{monitored by the}} loss on ignition (LOI) of the pulverised fuel. It {{is the role of}} the pulveriser-classifier combination to ensure pulverised fuel delivered to the burners is within the specified limits of fineness and mass flow deviation required to keep the LOI at an acceptable level. However, government imposed limits on emissions have spurred the conversion of many coal fired power plants to convert to the use of Low NOx Burners. To maintain good LOI or combustion efficiency, the limits of fineness and mass flow deviation or inter-outlet fuel distribution have become narrower. A lot of existing pulveriser units cannot operate efficiently within these limits hence retrofits of short term solutions such as orifice balancing and classifier maintenance has been applied. The work performed in this thesis relates to an investigation into coal classifier devices that function to control fineness and inter <b>pipe</b> <b>balancing</b> upstream of the burner and downstream of the pulverisers. A cold flow model of a static classifier was developed to investigate the flow characteristics so that design optimisations can be made. Dynamic similarity was achieved by designing a 1 / 3 scale model with air as the continuous phase and glass cenospheres of a similar size distribution as pulverised fuel, to simulate the coal dust. The rig was operated in positive pressure with air at room temperature and discharge to atmosphere. The Stokes number similarity (0. 11 -prototype vs. 0. 08 -model) was the most important dimensionless parameter to conserve as Reynolds number becomes independent of separation efficiency and pressure drop at high industrial values such as 2 x 10 4 Hoffman, 2008). Air-fuel ratio was also compromised and an assumption of dilute flow was made to qualify this. However, the effect of air fuel ratio was ascertained by its inclusion as an experimental variable. Experiments were conducted at air flow rates of 1. 41 - 1. 71 kg/s and air fuel ratios of 4. 8 - 10 with classifier vane angle adjustment (30 °- 60 °) and inlet swirl umbers (S) of 0. 49 – 1. Radial profiles of tangential, axial and radial velocity were obtained at several cross sections to determine the airflow pattern and establish links with the separation performance and outlet flow balance. Results show a proportional relationship between cone vane angle and cut size or particle fineness. Models can be derived from the data so that reliable predictions of fineness and outlet fuel balance can be used in power stations and replace simplistic and process simulator models that fail to correctly predict performance. It was found that swirl intensity is more significant a parameter in obtaining balanced flow at the classifier outlets than uniform air flow distribution in the mill. However the latter is important in obtaining high grade efficiencies and cut size. The study concludes that the static classifier can be further improved and retrofit-able solutions can be applied to problems of outlet flow imbalance and poor fineness at the mill outlets.
