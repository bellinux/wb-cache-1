500|$|In 1963 Timmons' playing, with Lewis Powers on {{bass and}} Ron McCurdy on drums, was {{described}} by a Washington Post reviewer as [...] "flexible and adventuresome [...] Glossing over everything is an undeniable sheen of church music and spirituals." [...] In 1965 the same reviewer commented that Timmons was employing musicians who were of much lower ability: [...] "Timmons lacks a certain passion <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> {{if this is not}} the fault of his sidemen." [...] Timmons started playing vibes in the mid-1960s. He occasionally played organ, but recorded only one track on that instrument – a 1964 version of [...] "Moanin'" [...] on From the Bottom. Recordings as a leader continued, usually as part of a trio or quartet, but, after joining Milestone Records around 1967, Timmons' album Got to Get It! featured him as part of a nonet, playing arrangements by Tom McIntosh.|$|E
500|$|Trumble {{was known}} for his cleverness on the field. C. B. Fry said of him, [...] "He is the most long-headed, observant and acute judge of the game, a perfect master of the whole art of placing fieldsmen and {{changing}} bowlers." [...] On one occasion when captaining his state side, Victoria, he deliberately bowled two wides that his fieldsmen allowed to roll to the boundary to score four runs for his opponents. This was done to save his tired bowlers from having to bowl again immediately, as his opponents would have been required to follow-on (bat twice in a row), at the time compulsory. When questioned by an onlooker about the dubious sportsmanship of the action, he replied, [...] "I had to do it, old chap, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> what my father will think of it?" [...] Trumble was respected by his teammates and opponents; New Zealand cricketer, Dan Reese, who played against and alongside Trumble said, [...] "His subtle humour, his fund of cricket stories, his kindness, and, above all, his judgment, made him a man of exceptional character." ...|$|E
500|$|The kiss {{generated}} strong {{reaction from}} {{the media and the}} celebrities alike. Nekesa Mumbi Moody from Associated Press deduced [...] "Twenty years after the first MTV Video Music Awards, and not much has changed — Madonna still makes jaws drop and cheeks blush." [...] Brian Hiatt from Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "The close-up of [...] locking lips with the 21-year-old Spears was an indelible MTV moment — sexy, vaguely transgressive, and as meaningless as it was entertaining." [...] Elysa Gardner from USA Today explained that the performance [...] "offered a poignant reminder of MTV's role in defining a youth culture that {{has become something of a}} tease — winking at convention without offering any fresh alternatives." [...] The MTV producers were skeptical, saying that [...] "It was sensational, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> what the good folk in places like Provo, Utah state, would make of it. Middle America is not gonna let this one go lightly." [...] When asked about it, Madonna revealed, [...] "I am kissing [...] and passing my energy on to her. Like kind of a mythological fairytale." [...] The performance was listed by Blender magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history. MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of the MTV Video Music Awards. In Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention World Tour, a remix interlude of [...] "Hollywood" [...] featured a breakdancer, a firedancer, a bellydancer, a tapdancer, and a skateboarder. The screens displayed animations of tarot cards. The performance was included in the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret live album and documentary. On the same tour, the performance of [...] "Into the Groove" [...] contained samples from the remix [...] "Into the Hollywood Groove".|$|E

2500|$|Neither fanatic nor lax, Jenner was a Christian {{who in his}} {{personal}} correspondence showed himself quite spiritual; he treasured the Bible. Some days before his death, he stated to a friend: [...] "I am not surprised that men are not grateful to me; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> {{that they are not}} grateful to God for the good which he has made me the instrument of conveying to my fellow creatures." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Thompson's {{opinion of}} the {{legislation}} changed and he conceded it had not worked as planned, saying [...] "I'm not prepared to go there yet, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if we shouldn't just take off the limits and have full disclosure with harsh penalties for not reporting everything on the Internet immediately." [...] Thompson {{thought that it was}} right to do away with soft money, that it was right to raise the limits on hard money, but that the limitation on political speech within 30 or 60 days of an election was wrong and the spending limits by outside groups are not working and they both should be repealed.|$|E
2500|$|MacLeod's {{memories}} of his first encounter with Darius are then shown in a flashback sequence set at the Battle of Waterloo. A British soldier, MacLeod carries a sick comrade when he meets Darius. MacLeod is eager {{to get back to}} fight, but Darius vehemently tries to show him the worth of human life and the futility of war. MacLeod protests that he has always been a warrior, fighting battles he believed to be just. Darius counters, [...] "Oh, I'm sure you're quite loyal to your convictions and compatriots. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> what these men think about death, about convictions and compatriotism [...] now?" [...] MacLeod watches the snow-covered battlefield where men are dying, lost for words. The subsequent flashback, set ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{measures}} {{have been taken to}} try give less affluent families the ability to educate their children. President Ronald Reagan introduced the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act on July 22, 1987. This Act was meant to allow children the ability to succeed if their families did not have a permanent residence. Leo Stagman, a single, African-American parent, located in Berkeley, California, whose daughter had received a great deal of aid from the Act wrote on October 20, 2012 that, [...] "During her education, she [...] was eligible for the free lunch program and received assistance under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Educational Act. I know my daughter's performance is hers, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> where she would have been without the assistance she received under the McKinney-Vento Act. Many students at BHS owe their graduation and success to the assistance under this law." ...|$|E
2500|$|Historian Diarmaid Ferriter said: [...] "There'll be broad {{consensus}} {{around what}} Bertie did in Northern Ireland, the social partnership and the unity {{he brought to}} his own party. Also, he made Fianna Fáil the permanent party of government. They used {{to have all of}} the power most of the time, but now they have most of the power all of the time. All of that takes skill. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> will people talk about 'Ahernism'? Is there any such thing? What does he actually stand for? In some ways Bertie's lack of vision was a positive, it made him flexible and willing to compromise, and he was certainly outstanding in that regard. But I dissent from the universal plaudits going around at the moment. He had no social or economic vision for the state he led. There was no fire in his belly. He didn't really want to change society for the better. He was the ward boss writ large. But at the moment it seems it's unfashionable to say anything adverse about Bertie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Little Inferno is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Tomorrow Corporation, an independent game developer founded in 2010 consisting of three people: Kyle Gray, Kyle Gabler, and Allan Blomquist. Gray previously worked on Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure, while Gabler and Blomquist worked on World of Goo. Gabler stated that Little Inferno was inspired by The Yule Log, a television program that consists of a 17-second loop of a burning log. The team had mused that the program was like [...] "a super boring game that some awful company will totally make for the Wii or smartphones," [...] which then inspired the proposal that [...] "WE could be that awful company! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if we can start with an exceptionally underwhelming premise, but then actually make the game really really surprisingly good?" [...] One of the goals in designing Little Inferno {{was to make the}} game [...] "unpredictable" [...] in order to distinguish it from existing games in which the player might easily determine the direction of the gameplay. Gabler remarked [...] "I want to be taken on a ride, and not know where I'm going. I want game designers to respect me enough to NOT let me know exactly what's going on. Give me hints. Let me NOT know. Let me figure it out. Totally change the game out from under me." ...|$|E

60|$|At {{last one}} of them went below and brought up a box of cigars from his chest, for some sailors always provide little delicacies of that kind, to break off the first shock of the salt water after laying idle ashore; and also by way of {{tapering}} off, as I mentioned a little while ago. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> that they never carried any pies and tarts to sea with them, instead of spirits and cigars.|$|R
