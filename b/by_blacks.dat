The exhibition drew on the Green Book to highlight artifacts and locations associated with travel <b>by</b> <b>blacks</b> during segregation, using dresser trunks to reflect venues such as hotels, restaurants, nightclubs and a Negro league baseball park.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the Central Ward was {{inhabited}} by Germans and other white Catholic and Christian groups. The German inhabitants were later replaced by Jews, who were then replaced <b>by</b> <b>Blacks.</b> The increased academic footprint in the University Heights neighborhood has produced gentrification, with landmark buildings undergoing renovation. Located in the Central Ward is the nation's largest health sciences university, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School. It {{is also home}} to three other universities – New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Rutgers University – Newark, and Essex County College. The Central Ward forms the present-day heart of Newark, and includes 26 public schools, two police precincts, including headquarters, four firehouses, and one branch library.|$|E
5|$|Poe's {{depiction}} of the African servant Jupiter is often considered stereotypical and racist from a modern perspective. Jupiter is depicted as superstitious and so lacking in intelligence that he cannot tell his left from his right. Poe probably included the character after being inspired by a similar character in Sheppard Lee (1836) by Robert Montgomery Bird, which he had reviewed. Black characters in fiction during this time period were not unusual, but Poe's choice {{to give him a}} speaking role was. Critics and scholars, however, question if Jupiter's accent was authentic or merely comic relief, suggesting it was not similar to accents used <b>by</b> <b>blacks</b> in Charleston but possibly inspired by Gullah.|$|E

5|$|At 10:30 pm, {{the crowd}} became violent after an {{individual}} threw a bottle off a roof {{into the crowd}} aggregated about the hospital. The group dispersed into gangs containing between 50–100 members. The gangs first broke windows of white businesses as they traveled through Harlem: if the mob was told the business was owned <b>by</b> <b>blacks,</b> they left it alone. If it was owned by whites, the store would be looted and vandalized. Rioters broke streetlights and threw white mannequins onto the ground. In grocery stores, the rioters took war-scarce items, such as coffee and sugar; clothing, and liquor; and furniture stores were also looted. Estimates put the total monetary damage between $250,000–$5,000,000, which included 1,485 stores burglarized and 4,495 windows broken.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, a {{significant}} number of lynchings occurred in the Southern United States, primarily of African Americans in the states of Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas. Between 1890 and 1920, about 3,000 African Americans were killed by lynch mobs, usually after whites were the victims of crimes purportedly committed <b>by</b> <b>blacks.</b> Supporters of lynching justified the practice as a way to assert dominance over African Americans, to whom they attributed a criminal nature. Lynching also provided a sense of white solidarity in a culture with changing demographics and power structures. Although lynching was tolerated by much of southern society, opponents of the practice emerged, including some religious leaders and the nascent National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).|$|E
25|$|The high rents {{and poor}} {{maintenance}} of housing stock, which Harlem residents suffered {{through much of}} the 20th century, was not merely the product of racism by white landlords. By 1914, 40% of Harlem's private houses and 10% of its tenements were owned <b>by</b> <b>blacks.</b> Wealthier blacks continued to purchase land in Harlem, and by 1920, {{a significant portion of the}} neighborhood was owned <b>by</b> <b>blacks.</b> By the late 1960s, 60% of the businesses in Harlem responding to surveys reported ownership <b>by</b> <b>blacks,</b> and an overwhelming fraction of new businesses were black owned after that time.|$|E

There is a small white discoidal lunule defined <b>by</b> <b>black</b> and a postmedial white band defined <b>by</b> <b>black</b> from the costa to vein 4, its inner edge sinuous and expanding at and below the costa. There is also a conical white patch defined <b>by</b> <b>black</b> from below {{the end of the}} cell to the inner margin and a subterminal white band defined <b>by</b> <b>black</b> and excurved and interrupted at the middle. The hindwings are bronze-yellow suffused in parts with fuscous and with an ill-defined white subbasai band and an antemedial quadrate white patch defined <b>by</b> <b>black</b> from the costa to the median nervure, with a narrow white band defined <b>by</b> <b>black</b> from it to the inner margin and a postmedial curved white band defined <b>by</b> <b>black</b> from the costa to vein 4, its inner edge sinuous and expanding at and below the costa. There is also a curved white band defined <b>by</b> <b>black</b> from below the end of the cell to the inner margin and a subterminal maculate white band defined <b>by</b> <b>black</b> formed <b>by</b> a subapical spot. There are three conjoined spots between veins 7 and 4 and two spots towards the tornus.|$|R

25|$|The Confiscation Act of 1862 {{allowed the}} Treasury Department to sell many {{captured}} {{lands on the}} grounds of delinquent taxes. All told, the government now claimed 76,775 acres of Sea Island land. Auditors arrived in Port Royal and began to assess the estates now occupied <b>by</b> <b>blacks</b> and missionaries. The stakes were high: the Sea Island cotton harvest represented a lucrative commodity for Northern investors to control.|$|E
25|$|The Tillman {{movement}} {{succeeded in}} enacting {{a number of}} Tillman's proposals and pet projects. Among those was the crafting of a new state constitution and a state dispensary system for alcohol. Tillman held a “pathological fear of Negro rule.” White elites created a new constitution with provisions to suppress voting <b>by</b> <b>blacks</b> and poor whites following the 1890 model of Mississippi, which had survived {{an appeal to the}} US Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|Both men {{and women}} were hired for the arts {{programs}} (such as music, theater and writing).

25|$|It {{took years}} for {{business}} ownership {{to reflect the}} new reality.

25|$|Martí, {{on his way}} to Cuba, {{gave the}} Proclamation of Montecristi in Santo Domingo, {{outlining}} the policy for Cuba's war of independence: the war was to be waged <b>by</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites alike; participation of all blacks was crucial for victory; Spaniards who did not object to the war effort should be spared, private rural properties should not be damaged; and the revolution should bring new economic life to Cuba.|$|E
25|$|The coastal {{lowlands}} {{north of}} Manta were conquered, {{not by the}} Spanish, but <b>by</b> <b>blacks</b> from the Guinean coast who, as slaves, were shipwrecked en route from Panama to Peru in 1570.

25|$|After Reconstruction, {{conservative}} white Democrats strove {{for political}} power until they regained it in 1877. This was accomplished partly through violent actions by white paramilitary groups targeting freedmen {{and their allies}} to discourage them from voting. From 1885 to 1889, after regaining power, the white-dominated state legislature passed statutes to reduce voting <b>by</b> <b>blacks</b> and poor whites, which had threatened white Democratic power with a populist coalition. As these groups were stripped from voter rolls, white Democrats established power in a one-party state, as happened across the South.|$|E
25|$|The {{transition}} government left {{a better}} infrastructure, public health, education, and agricultural development {{as well as}} a democratic system. The country had fully democratic elections in 1930, won by Sténio Vincent. The Garde was a new kind of military institution in Haiti. It was a force manned overwhelmingly <b>by</b> <b>blacks,</b> with a United States-trained black commander, Colonel Démosthènes Pétrus Calixte. Most of the Garde's officers, however, were mulattoes. The Garde was a national organization; it departed from the regionalism that had characterized most of Haiti's previous armies. In theory, its charge was apolitical—to maintain internal order, while supporting a popularly elected government. The Garde initially adhered to this role.|$|E
25|$|AuCoin {{enrolled}} at Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon, {{then transferred to}} Portland State University. In 1961, he enlisted in the United States Army. He {{was assigned to the}} 2nd Infantry Division and the 10th Mountain Division where he served as a public information specialist, writing dispatches to The Nashville Banner, the Louisville Courier-Journal, The Nashville Tennessean, Stars and Stripes, and Army Times, among other publications. AuCoin's Army postings included Fort Ord, California; Fort Slocum, New York; Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Fort Benning, Georgia; and Sullivan Barracks, West Germany. While stationed in the segregated South, AuCoin was caught up in a near race riot in reaction to a sit-in <b>by</b> <b>blacks</b> at an all-white lunch counter, an event that crystallized his zeal for progressive politics.|$|E
