25|$|In 1961 the XP-755 Mako Shark show car was {{designed}} by Larry Shinoda as a concept for future Corvettes. In keeping with the name, the streamlining, pointed snout, and other detailing was partly inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of that very fast fish. The 1961 Corvette tail was given two additional tail lights (six total) for the concept car. The body inspired the 1963 production Sting Ray.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the track was positive, with reviewers deeming it as an important addition to Madonna's music catalog. At the 63rd Academy Awards held on March 25, 1991, the song won an Oscar for Best Original Song, awarded to Sondheim. Madonna attended the ceremony along with singer Michael Jackson as her date, and performed [...] "Sooner or Later" [...] onstage, being inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of actress Marilyn Monroe. Madonna also performed the song at her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour.|$|E

500|$|Madonna was {{inspired}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, {{but that is}} the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] "The Look of Love" [...] was released as the third single from the soundtrack in the United Kingdom, some European countries and Japan. [...] "I Know It", a track from Madonna's self-titled debut album, appeared as the B-side. In 1989, the song was used as the B-side for the [...] "Express Yourself" [...] single release.|$|E
500|$|With the single's cover art and its {{accompanying}} music video, Madonna {{ushered in}} another image change, inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of Hollywood actress Jean Harlow. The {{black and white}} video was directed by photographer Melodie McDaniel, who was chosen by the singer due to McDaniel's previous short films. It features Madonna as a singer in a nightclub in Harlem, New York. Interspersed with scenes of daily life in the neighborhood, the video ends with Madonna uniting with her lover and their supposed child. The video sparked academic discussions about what might constitute the lyrical secret of the song. Madonna performed [...] "Secret" [...] on tour {{for the first time}} during her 2001 Drowned World Tour. It was later performed at the Houston stop of her Sticky and Sweet Tour in November 2008 as a fan request, and on the Rebel Heart Tour in 2015.|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} {{played by}} Vikram were spoofed by Vadivelu in the Tamil film Aaru (2005); the comedy sequence also features four {{songs from the}} film's soundtrack album. Aparichitudu, the film's Telugu version, was parodied by comedian Venu Madhav in the Telugu films Chatrapati (2005) and Seenugadu Chiranjeevi Fan (2005). It was also parodied, along with Chandramukhi, in the film Rajababu (2006). In the 2010 film Thamizh Padam, a full-length parody on stereotypical characters and clichéd sequences in Tamil cinema, the lead actor Shiva recreates the [...] "Anthakoopam" [...] punishment sequence to comic effect, where he tries to force a herd of buffaloes into stampeding a villain but fails in his attempt. Later, the comedy sequence was re-enacted by Allari Naresh in Sudigadu (2012), an official remake of Thamizh Padam. In the 2012 Kannada film Yaare Koogadali, a remake of the Tamil film Poraali (2011), the long and unkempt hair sported by Puneeth Rajkumar was reportedly inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of Anniyan. The character Remo inspired Sivakarthikeyan's film to have a title of the same name.|$|E

500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend also {{expressed}} mixed point of {{views on the}} episode, having different opinions on each storyline. She noted how the scene which sees Torres [...] "desperately trying to escape George's room after three rolls in the hay with the grief-stricken intern" [...] helped the episode reach {{a high level of}} entertainment: [...] "The look, or should I say, looks on Izzie's face as Callie rambled on about legs being bent the wrong way and needing to heal after too much sex were priceless and could only matched <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> she gave to George when he opened the door, clearly ready for Callie once more." [...] She highly praised the scene that concludes Stevens' storyline in the episode, seeing [...] "a heart to heart in which she agrees to back off". Shepherd's characterization was negatively responded to, whose enraged attitude was described as [...] "unhealthy" [...] for the evolution of his [...] "fresh relationship" [...] with Grey. West positively received the storyline involving the race for the title of chief, noting that [...] "it was kind of funny to see like the attendings were the kids in the episode".|$|E
500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna was inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, {{but that is the}} way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E
2500|$|In 1844-5, when Marx was {{starting}} to settle his account with Hegel and the Young Hegelians in his writings, he critiqued the Young Hegelians for limiting the horizon of their critique to religion and not taking up the critique {{of the state and}} civil society as paramount. Indeed, in 1844, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of Marx's writings in that period (most famous of which is the [...] "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844", a text that most explicitly elaborated his theory of alienation), Marx's thinking could have taken at least three possible courses: the study of law, religion, and the state; the study of natural philosophy; and the study of political economy.|$|E

[...] He does not [...] "remember doing any sketches to get him right," [...] the [...] "outfit was described somewhat in the script... and details of it were heavily inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of Kevin O'Neill's Nemesis the Warlock. Bolland was, he acknowledges, [...] "by far the slowest of the rotating Judge Death artists," [...] opting to [...] "take as long as I needed and do a half-way decent job" [...] rather than rushing. For the sequel, a [...] "massive (for me) 30 pages," [...] 2000 AD's editorial banked one-off stories to give Bolland long enough to draw it all.|$|E
2500|$|Suzuki's Koji Yoshiura {{designed}} {{the look of}} the new Hayabusa. He had previously styled the first generation Hayabusa, as well as the Suzuki Bandit 400, RF600R, TL1000S and the SV650. For research, Yoshiura traveled around the United States to bike nights and clubs for a first hand look at the styling aesthetic of the Hayabusa custom scene, and was inspired as much <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> and build of the Hayabusa rider as their custom bikes. While the second generation is very close to the first in overall shape, and is largely dictated by wind tunnel tests, the raised lines and curves are meant to suggest a muscular build. Said Yoshiura, [...] "I wanted to create a masculine form that complements a rider's muscular structure with hints of developed bicep, forearm and calves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pyrrhus {{had little}} time to mourn, as he was {{immediately}} offered an opportunity to intervene in a civic dispute in Argos. Since Antigonus Gonatas was approaching too, he hastened to enter the city with his army by stealth, {{only to find the}} place crowded with hostile troops. During the confused battle in the narrow city streets, Pyrrhus was trapped. [...] While he was fighting an Argive soldier, the soldier's old mother, who was watching from a rooftop, threw a tile which knocked him from his horse and broke part of his spine, paralyzing him. [...] Whether he was alive or not after the blow is dubious, but his death was assured when a Macedonian soldier named Zopyrus, though frightened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> {{on the face of the}} unconscious king, hesitantly and ineptly beheaded his motionless body.|$|E

2500|$|Upon the character's announcement, Treadwell-Collins {{explained}} {{that in their}} fictional backstory, Mick and Linda {{have been married for}} over twenty years, and have been together since they were teenagers. Hello called them [...] "childhood sweethearts". They were called [...] "a tight family unit", and Treadwell-Collins said they have a [...] "good marriage" [...] and [...] "an easy shorthand with each other—but can also still fight like teenagers." [...] He said that the characters would laugh, cry, argue and make up, which would embarrass their children, but would delight their neighbours. It was said that the couple [...] "still love each other, no matter what life throws at them", and that after moving to the fictional setting of Walford from Watford, [...] "life's about to throw them a few curve balls." [...] Inside Soap said that Mick and Linda have a passionate relationship and adore each other. Bright {{explained that}} Mick and Linda have grown up together, and said: [...] "It's a weird thing when you've known someone your whole life—you're more than just husband and wife. You're something else." [...] She later said that Mick and Linda have known each other since they were five or six years old, and can finish each other's sentences and know how the other is feeling <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> on their face. Dyer and Bright both said that Mick and Linda are passionate and lustful, with Bright saying they are [...] "madly in love" [...] and describing a [...] "real fizz between them". She said, [...] "they're kind of tearing each other's heads off or tearing each other's clothes off." [...] Dyer said there is a [...] "Den and Angie [...] feel" [...] to the relationship. Jane Simon from the Daily Mirror said that the fact Mick and Linda are happily married is a [...] "rare thing in soapland". However, in July 2014, it was revealed in storylines that Mick and Linda are not married, yet all their families believes they are, a fact that left Carena Crawford from All About Soap wondering why they never got married and why they kept this a secret, but she hoped for a big wedding.|$|E
