5|$|The {{traditional}} view is {{that the}} coelom(s) in deuterostomes and protostomes form by different process, called enterocoely and schizocoely respectively.

5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and communications channels that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users. For <b>both</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> network, repeaters may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat attenuation that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when <b>both</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E

The second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by Winglet Technology, a company based in Wichita, Kansas.

5|$|Satellite males, about 16% of {{the total}} number, have white or mottled ruffs and do not occupy territories; they enter leks and attempt to mate with the females visiting the territories {{occupied}} by the resident males. Resident males tolerate the satellite birds because, although they are competitors for mating with the females, the presence of <b>both</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> male on a territory attracts additional females. Females also prefer larger leks, and leks surrounded by taller plants, which give better nesting habitat.|$|E
5|$|Wildebeest {{can also}} {{listen in on}} the alarm calls of other species, and by doing so can reduce their risk of predation. One study showed, along with other ungulates, wildebeests responded more {{strongly}} to the baboon alarm calls compared to the baboon contest calls, though <b>both</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> calls had similar patterns, amplitudes, and durations. The alarm calls were a response of the baboons to lions, and the contest calls were recorded when a dispute between two males occurred.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation {{may cause}} either the gain {{of a new}} feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows <b>both</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> change is {{bacterial}} adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying {{the target of the}} drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell. Other striking examples are the bacteria Escherichia coli evolving the ability to use citric acid as a nutrient in a long-term laboratory experiment, Flavobacterium evolving a novel enzyme that allows these bacteria to grow on the by-products of nylon manufacturing, and the soil bacterium Sphingobium evolving an entirely new metabolic pathway that degrades the synthetic pesticide pentachlorophenol. An interesting but still controversial idea is that some adaptations might increase the ability of organisms to generate genetic diversity and adapt by natural selection (increasing organisms' evolvability).|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} feature of Western Chalukya roof art {{is the use of}} domical ceilings (not {{to be confused with the}} European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating joints) and square ceilings. <b>Both</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|E
5|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{there are}} several reasons why admitting the language of fraud to justify a fully secret trust, but not a half-secret trust, would be sub-optimal. This is considered one principal reason why the court in Blackwell v Blackwell established that <b>both</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> secret trust shared a single justification. A half-secret trust appears closer to fulfilling the formality requirements as laid down in the Wills Act, so the conclusion that it is less likely to be enforced seems contradictory. Also, such a rule would encourage fully secret trusts, with a wider possibility for fraud. It would also spark considerable litigation on whether a particular clause resulted in a fully secret or half-secret trust. Thus it may be argued that despite the difficulties, a half-secret trust should be enforced if fully secret trusts are.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of the year 1799, a {{translation}} of Franz Carl Achard's ground-breaking work on the production of sugar from beets appeared in Nicholson's Journal. Until that time, sugar cane, which was grown overseas, was the only plant from which sugar could be derived. This information made possible the creation of a domestic sugar industry, and was greeted with great interest. A short time after the article's publication, Accum had samples of beet sugar sent from Berlin, and presented them to William Nicholson. This was the first time sugar derived from beets had ever been present in England. Following his careful analysis of <b>both</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> sugar, Nicholson published a detailed report in the January edition of his journal, stating that there was no appreciable difference in taste between the two.|$|E
