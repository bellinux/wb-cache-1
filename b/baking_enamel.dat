40|$|A {{method for}} {{applying}} photographic resists to otherwise incompatible substrates, {{such as a}} <b>baking</b> <b>enamel</b> paint surface, is described wherein the uncured enamel paint surface is coated with a non-curing lacquer which is, in turn, coated with a partially cured lacquer. The non-curing lacquer adheres to the enamel and a photo resist material satisfactorily adheres to the partially cured lacquer. Once normal photo etching techniques are employed the lacquer coats can be easily removed from the enamel leaving the photo etched image. In the case of edge lighted instrument panels, a coat of uncured enamel is placed over the cured enamel followed by the lacquer coats and the photo resists which is exposed and developed. Once the etched uncured enamel is cured, the lacquer coats are removed leaving an etched panel...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the auther has {{attempt to}} study electrophysiologically {{the aspect of}} pallidofugal fibers which are intermediated by the pallidum to the fibers arising from the motor area as the {{conduction}} system of epileptic discharge. Action potentials of motor cortex, basal ganglia, nuclei of the midbrain and spinal cord were recorded during major convulsive or subclinical seizures which are elicited by local administration of metrazol to the motor cortex or the thalamus of dogs. For subcortical recordings, a pair of bipor needle electrodes made of steel wire, mapproximately 200 μ in diameter on tungsten microelectrodes approximately 20 μ in diameter at the tip were used. Both steel and tungsten electrodes insulated by <b>baking</b> <b>enamel</b> except the tip. Spike discharges (duration of each spike is 20 - 60 msec. amplitude 50 - 100 μV recorded by abovementioned electrodes) are accounted for the epileptic discharges in this study. The results were as follows: 1) There are two different pathways transmitting the discharges from the motor area to the pallidum, one is direct connection between the motor cortex to the pallidum and the other has some relays the nuclei, thalamus and caudate nucleus, between them. These different pathways are connected separately to two different pallidofugal fiber group at the pallidum. 2) The pallidofugal fiber group, which {{is connected to the}} former pathways at the pallidum, are relayed at the contralateral substantia nigra and then terminated to anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. There is a fiber crossing to the other side at the midbrain between the pallidum and substantia nigra. 3) The pallidofugal fiber group connected to the latter at the pallidum does not show crossing to the other side on its course to the homolateral substantia nigra. But the downward fibers from the substantia nigra show a crossing to the other side at the pons and terminate in the contralateral anterior horn cells...|$|E
40|$|Alkyd/melamine resin {{mixtures}} {{are mainly}} used in industrial <b>baking</b> <b>enamels.</b> The {{effects of the}} alkyd/butylated melamine resin ratio (from 90 / 10 to 50 / 50) and curing temperature (from 110 to 180 °C) on the crosslinking and {{properties of the coating}} are presented in this paper. The curing reactions through functional groups of resins were monitored by FT-IR spectroscopy. The hardness, elasticity, degree of adherence and gloss were also determined. Optimal coating properties could be achieved with an alkyd/melamine resin ratio of 80 / 20, a curing temperature of 150 °C and a curing time of 20 min. Organic coatings based on alkyd and melamine resins are high-quality industrial finishes. The combination of melamine-formaldehyde resins with suitable alkyd resin in surface coatings yields better hardness, mar and chemical resistance, improves weatherability, and reduces thermal curing times [1]. Alkyd-melamine resin blends are used mainly for the high-quality finishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of an alkyd resin with a melamine-formaldehyde resin gives a cured enamel film with {{the flexibility of}} the alkyd constituent and the high chemical resistance and hardness of the melamine resin at the same time. The melamine resin is a minor constituent and plays the role of a crosslinking agent. In this paper, alkyd resins of high hydroxyl numbers based on trimethylolpropane, ricinoleic acid and phthalic anhydride were synthesized. Two alkyds having 30 and 40 wt% of ricinoleic acid were formulated by calculation on alkyd constant. Alkyds were characterized by FTIR and by the determination of acid and hydroxyl numbers. Then synthesized alkyds were made into <b>baking</b> <b>enamels</b> by mixing with melamine-formaldehyde resins (weight ratio of 70 : 30 based on dried mass). Two types of commercial melamine resins were used: threeisobutoxymethyl melamine-formaldehyde resin (TIMMF) and hexamethoxymethyl melamine resin (HMMMF). Prepared alkyd/melamine resin mixtures were cured in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) under non-isothermal mode. Apparent degree of curing as a function of temperature was calculated from the curing enthalpies. Kinetic parameters of curing were calculated using Freeman-Carroll method. TIMMF resin is more reactive with synthesized alkyds than HMMMF resin what was expected. Alkyd resin with 30 wt% of ricinoleic acid is slightly more reactive than alkyd with 40 wt% of ricinoleic acid, probably because it has the high contents of free hydroxyl and acid groups. The gel content, Tg, thermal stability, hardness, elasticity and impact resistance of coated films cured at 150 °C for 60 min were measured. Cured films show good thermal stability since the onset of films thermal degradation determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is observed at the temperatures from 281 to 329 °C. Films based on alkyd 30 are more thermal stable than those from alkyd 40, with the same melamine resin. The type of alkyd resin has no significant effect on the gel content and the hardness of film. Hardness of cured film increases with increasing of Tg. The values of the films elasticity are satisfied for all prepared samples and are independent on the type of alkyd or melamine resin. The impact resistances of coated films are very high...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic resins {{are used}} as binders in {{protective}} coatings. An alkyd/melamine resin mixture is the usual composition for the preparation of coating called <b>Baking</b> <b>enamel</b> or Stoving enamel cured through functional groups of resin. Mostly these stoving alkyds are short oil alkyd type and synthesized from coconut oil. This research project describes synthetic resins of the alkyd type and synthesize of such resins. Also this research focused on novel modified stoving alkyd resins having improved properties such as Drying time, Film hardness, Adhesion and Gloss which are synthesized using blends of coconut oil and karawila seed oil. Fatty acid distribution of Coconut oil shows that it is having saturated fatty acids in major quantity and very small amount of oleic and linoleic acids present in the mixture. Coconut oil has an acid value of 3. 22 mg g - 1 and saponification value of 251. 9 mg g - 1. {{on the other hand}} karawila seed (MC 43 / oil is havig an acid value of 2. 87 mg g-I and saponification value of 203. 94 mg g-I. Karawila seed oil consist conjugated trienoic acid in large quantity and shows good drying properties compared to other drying oils. Blending is done to improve the film properties and to monitor air drying ability of alkyd synthesized by oil blends., Both the oils are having low acid values and this leads to the selection of monoglyceride process as the method of manufacturing. Better film properties could be obtained when a mixture of Propylene Glycol and Pentaerythritol was used as polyols with excess OH. Film properties were compared by gradually increasing the karawila oil -content to a maximum of 10 %, since the yield ofkarawila seed oil is 24 % 1 while maintaining the oil length at 45 %. Excellent film properties were shown for the oil percentage of karawila seed oil in the total mixture is 10 %...|$|E
