40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether serum selenium levels {{are associated with}} the conversion of <b>bacteriological</b> <b>tests</b> in patients diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis after eight weeks of standard treatment. Methods: We evaluated 35 healthy male controls and 35 male patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, the latter being evaluated at baseline, as well as at 30 and 60 days of antituberculosis treatment. For all participants, we measured anthropometric indices, as well as determining serum levels of albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and selenium. Because there are no reference values for the Brazilian population, we used the median of the serum selenium level of the controls as the cut-off point. At 30 and 60 days of antituberculosis treatment, we repeated the biochemical tests, as well as collecting sputum for smear microscopy and culture from the patients. Results: The mean age of the patients was 38. 4 &# 177; 11. 4 years. Of the 35 patients, 25 (71 %) described themselves as alcoholic; 20 (57. 0 %) were smokers; and 21 (60. 0 %) and 32 (91. 4 %) presented with muscle mass depletion as determined by measuring the triceps skinfold thickness and arm muscle area, respectively. Of 24 patients, 12 (39. 2 %) were classified as moderately or severely emaciated, and 15 (62. 5 %) had lost > 10 % of their body weight by six months before diagnosis. At baseline, the tuberculosis group had lower serum selenium levels than did the control group. The conversion of <b>bacteriological</b> <b>tests</b> was associated with the CRP/albumin ratio and serum selenium levels 60 days after treatment initiation. Conclusions: Higher serum selenium levels after 60 days of treatment were associated with the conversion of <b>bacteriological</b> <b>tests</b> in pulmonary tuberculosis patients...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: A slide microtest for gelatin {{liquefaction}} is described. Members {{of the genera}} Cloaca, Bacillus and Clostridium {{were tested}} with varying results. A limitation of the method {{is its ability to}} detect only ready-formed enzyme. The main advantage is that small amounts of culture are needed and the organisms may be grown under any selected conditions. Gelatinase activity in bacteria is detected by methods which often require the progeny of a small inoculum to liquefy relatively huge amounts of sub-strate at a temperature unfavourable to the growth of the organism. Lewert & Lee (1954), investigating the gelatinase of Helminth larvae, used a thin film of gelatin on a glass slide as substrate, liquefaction (hydrolysis) being shown by clear areas on the fixed and stained slide. The method required very small amounts of material and was quick, so that its possible application as a <b>bacteriological</b> <b>test</b> was considered. METHODS Strains from the National Collection of Type Cultures were used as tes...|$|E

40|$|This {{procedure}} {{is to provide}} clear guidelines for disinfecting water piping. This procedure covers new domestic water pipe installations and maintenance on existing piping. II. GENERAL Heavy particulates generally contain bacteria and prevent even very high chlorine concentrations from contacting and killing such organisms. It is, therefore, essential that the procedures of this section be observed to assure that a water main and its appurtenances are thoroughly clean for the final disinfection by chlorination. Also, any connection of a new water main to the active distribution system prior to receipt of satisfactory bacteriological samples may constitute a cross-connection. Therefore, the new main must be isolated until a <b>bacteriological</b> <b>test</b> is satisfactorily completed. The United States Environmental Protection Agency sets national standards for drinking water. To insure our compliance with these standards all work done on domestic water piping will be disinfected according to the following processes.

40|$|An {{assortment}} of 496 samples of frozen foods consisting of fish or marine products, variety types, and cream pie desserts {{were subjected to}} four parallel examinations for the recovery of Escherichia coli. The test procedures consisted of two low-temperature (35 C) and two high-temperature (44 C) presumptive tests, followed by an E C confirmatory test at 45. 5 C. Of all the test methods examined, a single Lauryl Sulfate Tryptose (LST) presumptive test at 44 C gave best E. coli recovery (425). This recovery compared favorably with the lengthier Association of Official Analytical Chemists test with which only 420 E. coli cells were recovered. The LST (44 C) test saves much time, since it renders a follow-up 48 -hr confirmatory test unnecessary. Moreover, since 96 % of all the E. coli are recovered within 24 hr by LST (44 C), it is essentially a 24 -hr test.

During the pilot study, a microfiltration pilot unit was rented from Memcor, Inc., a division of US Filter. This unit treated 20 to 21 gallons per minute (gpm) of raw water from Monroe’s raw water pump station that {{is located on the}} Alcovy River. The membrane selected to conduct the pilot study was tolerant of oxidizing agents (e. g., chlorine or chlorine dioxide), which were required to control iron and manganese. In summary of the pilot study, the microfiltration unit was able to treat raw water directly from the Alcovy River (i. e., direct filtration) without incidence of any potential violation of drinking water regulations on a full-scale basis. Effluent turbidity averaged 0. 038 NTU throughout the study, which is well below the filtered effluent turbidity level of 0. 3 NTU being imposed by the USEPA as part of the new Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (IESWTR).
