5|$|The Naval Treaties of the 1920s and 1930s {{limited the}} number of battleships, though {{technical}} innovation in battleship design continued. Both the Allied and Axis powers built battleships during World War II, though the increasing importance of the aircraft carrier meant that the battleship played a less important role than had <b>been</b> <b>expected.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the UERL's {{success in}} {{financing}} and constructing the Hampstead Railway in only seven years, its opening {{was not the}} financial success that had <b>been</b> <b>expected.</b> In the Hampstead Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 25million passengers, just half of the 50million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be greatly over-optimistic, as did the improvement in passenger numbers expected on the newly electrified MDR – in each case achieving only around fifty per cent of their targets.|$|E

The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be similarly over-optimistic, as did the projected figures for the newly electrified DR – in each case, numbers achieved only around fifty per cent of their targets.|$|E
5|$|God by {{a sudden}} {{conversion}} subdued and brought my mind to a teachable frame, which was more hardened in such matters than might have <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> from one at my early period of life.

5|$|In early November 2010 the United States {{launched}} QE2, {{the second}} round of quantitative easing, which had <b>been</b> <b>expected.</b> The Federal Reserve made an additional $600 billion available for the purchase of financial assets.

He went hitless in five games, with seven strikeouts, and when the minor league season ended on September 2 he was moved to Camelback Ranch to continue his rehab rather than being activated.|$|E
5|$|Nash was {{selected}} as captain of South Melbourne for the 1937 season to replace the retiring Jack Bisset, {{becoming part of the}} first father and son team to captain a VFL/AFL side. It is thought that South Melbourne's newly appointed coach Roy Cazaly influenced the selection of Nash as captain, as Cazaly, Nash's coach in Tasmania, believed Nash to be the best footballer ever. There was some controversy over Nash's selection as captain, as it had <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> that vice-captain Brighton Diggins would be named captain. In response, Diggins quit South.|$|E

5|$|The Civil Partnership Act {{came into}} effect on 1 January 2011.

5|$|The {{campaign}} {{opened on}} 1 May 1945 when the 26th Brigade Group {{landed on the}} small island of Tarakan off {{the east coast of}} Borneo. The goal of this operation was to secure the island's airstrip as a base to support the planned landings at Brunei and Balikpapan. While it had <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> that it would take only a few weeks to secure Tarakan and re-open the airstrip, intensive fighting on the island lasted until 19 June and the airstrip was not opened until 28 June. As a result, the operation is generally considered to have not been worthwhile.|$|E

In response, on January 7, 1953, Truman announced the detonation of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, which was much {{more powerful than the}} Soviets' atomic weapons.|$|E

5|$|At age 16, Honório Hermeto was {{commissioned}} as a lieutenant and standard-bearer of the 2nd Militia Cavalry Regiment, 1st Company, in Vila Rica. Antônio Neto made great {{efforts to provide}} Honório Hermeto with an education of much higher quality than would normally have <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> {{in a family of}} their limited financial means. The promotion to captain in 1819 increased Antônio Neto's income, allowing his eldest son to go to Portugal and enroll in the University of Coimbra's law school in 1820, thus ending Honório Hermeto's brief military career. He was an excellent student and struck up acquaintances among his fellow Brazilians in Coimbra, including Paulino Soares de Sousa (who would become one of his greatest allies and later the 1st Viscount of Uruguai) and Aureliano de Sousa Oliveira Coutinho (later Viscount of Sepetiba).|$|E
5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact was a NASA {{space probe}} {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005.

At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris from {{the interior of the}} nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had <b>been</b> <b>expected.</b> The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud, obscuring the view of the impact crater.|$|E
