We {{climbed out of the}} violet-purple shadows towards the upland where the last of the day lingered. I was filled to my moist eyes with the almost sacred <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> and association that clad the landscape.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem and {{experiences}} of “ecological hetero-genesis of the ends”, within an architectural context, by defining the 40 year old trajectory of the ecological approach to architecture in a partial and critical balance based on the main results obtained. It results being a context of successes and insufficiencies from which a decisive step {{in the direction of}} a phenomenological architectural practice of eco-sustainability can be taken, through tests on both the scale of the nature-city as well as “residential dislocation”. The paper {{deals with the}}se new experiences in order to show the visions of projects and initial realisations. This research deals with the description of a phenomenological approach to design by two new procedures of direct union in relation with the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> of limit in architecture. Where the sense of limit is extended both to the availability of the resources and the concept of balance of the ecosystem in which architectures are immersed...|$|E

60|$|Now in {{this matter}} of {{physical}} appetites I {{do not know whether}} to describe myself as a sensualist or an ascetic. If an ascetic is one who suppresses to a minimum all deference to these impulses, then certainly I am not an ascetic; if a sensualist is one who gives himself to heedless gratification, then certainly I am not a sensualist. But I find myself balanced in an intermediate position by something that I will speak <b>of</b> as the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>Beauty.</b> This <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>Beauty</b> is something in me which demands not simply gratification but the best and keenest <b>of</b> a <b>sense</b> or continuance <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> impressions, and which refuses coarse quantitative assuagements. It ranges all over the senses, and just as I refuse to wholly cut off any of my motives, so do I refuse to limit its use to the plane of the eye or the ear.|$|R

40|$|Dorothy Wordsworth {{continued}} to be a traveler all her life. The present essays examines Dorothy Wordsworth's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>beauty</b> and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> identity through her journey from her adolescence until the termination of the Grasmere Journal. Losing their parents when young, Dorothy and William Wordsworth yearned to establish their own home, and were able to realize this ten years later at Grasmere. Their affection deepened so much as to almost completely identify themselves with each other. Dorothy's letters and the Grasmere Journal show her passion, acute sensitivity, and critical eye for poetry which gave the inspiration and stimulus to William for writing poems. However, due to William's marriage with Mary Hutchinson, Dorothy was gradually driven to despair. She came to be consumed with memories from the past, and {{it can be argued that}} it was William's poems which accelerated this tendency and imprisoned her in her past...|$|R
50|$|Pomquet {{is home to}} {{approximately}} 900 inhabitants, most of Acadian ancestry. Many others visit and decide to make Pomquet their home - for its <b>beauty,</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community, and connection {{to the land and}} water. The community is nestled along two harbours (Pomquet and Monk's Head) separated from St. George's Bay by the barrier island that houses the unique Pomquet Beach.|$|R
60|$|And when I write thus of our selves I mean {{our bodies}} {{quite as much}} as our imaginations; {{the two sides of}} us are covered up alike and put alike into disguises and unnatural shapes, we are taught and forced to hide them for the same reasons, from a fear of {{ourselves}} and a fear of the people about us. The <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>beauty,</b> the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> one's body, the freedom of thought and of desire and the wonder of life, are all interwoven strands. I remember that in the Park of Burnmore one great craving I had was to take off my clothes there altogether, and bathe in a clear place among loosestrife and meadowsweet, and afterwards lie wet and naked upon the soft green turf with the sun shining upon me. But I thought also that that was a very wicked and shameful craving to have, and I never dared give way to it.|$|R

40|$|A {{means of}} {{empowering}} students’ self-potentials is through art performance. By so doing {{they may get}} first-hand experience, knowledge, skills, creative thinking, and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>beauty.</b> Their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> arts guides them to do their works creatively, innovatively and aesthetically. An art performance which can be taught to them is dance. It helps them grow up and possess an awareness of multi-culture both locally and globally which in its turn creates actions for respect, tolerance and harmony amidst the multi-cultural society. The sort of dance taught could be those which do not require pains-taking movements, while the themes could be about plays, daily activities, or animals. Semut (ant) dance is an example. Through practicing it, they not only have fun but also learn how to cooperate. Accordingly, it {{can serve as a}} medium to get them develop their characters through good deeds therein. Among the characters they can learn are: (1) respect and polite; (2) cooperation (gotong-royong); and (3) adaptation.   Key words: Semut Dance, Students’ Character Developmen...|$|R
50|$|Birds of a Feather is Rosen's {{most widely}} seen {{photographic}} series. Rosen attributes the extremely positive {{response to the}} series to its <b>beauty</b> and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor. The images feature portraits of exotic birds against coordinating wallpaper backgrounds. The series alludes to the Victorian Era, when collecting and displaying birds was fashionable. Rosen explained of the series:The Industrial Revolution and colonization created this disconnect from nature in the Victorian Era and yielded an awareness of faraway places, amazing creatures, and unfamiliar cultures… This series references that desire to possess the beautiful and exotic.|$|R

40|$|Heritage sites, {{inclusive}} of cultural landscapes, are understood to derive their significance from perceptions <b>of</b> <b>beauty,</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> place and, {{when it has}} been impacted by humans, its genius loci and tangible qualities and the overlay of their intangible associations. In order for a site to be recognized concurrence of an Authorised Heritage Discourse whose content is constructed by academics and professionally trained heritage experts and an Autochthonous Discourse defined and expressed by laypersons, occupying or having an association with the site or sites. When Ida's Valley Cultural Landscape underwent processes of identification and declaration (formal process) as a National Heritage Site in 2008 the assumption {{was that there was}} consensus between the two views, the Authorized Heritage Discourse and the Autochthonous Discourse. The hypothesis, then, in the case of Ida's Valley Cultural Landscape which lies just beyond the limits of the town, Stellenbosch, was that there was agreement between the AHD and the AD. The question that arose was whether the two readings of heritage value aligned and whether there really was agreement in terms of the significance of the site and the values it represented. This is found not to be the case. Concerns were raised regarding {{the manner in which the}} public participation process was handled, the content of the statement of significance around issues of identification, identity and, consequently, its impact on the idea of value. In addition, the issues of land for development, the locus of land ownership and the subsequent value and universal acceptance were placed under scrutiny and severely criticized by the local public and community groups. The conclusion was that there was no agreement between the two positions. The dissertation describes the exploration of these tensions...|$|R

Andree Farias from Christianity Today said that [...] "Albertine proves it is possible to strike the perfect balance between art and faith, while still remaining accessible to both sides of the Christian-mainstream divide." [...] Jesus Freak Hideout's David Goodman described Albertine as [...] "one of the most brilliantly expressive and musically well-crafted albums of its kind."Mike Schiller from PopMatters stated that [...] "Fraser's songs do have a tendency to blur boundary between church and popular art together, with the occasional beautiful, touching piece that grabs hold of all of the right nerves and doesn't let go".The Southern Cross identified Albertine as [...] "the kind of album that after repeated listening quietly creeps up on the listener with its hypnotic <b>beauty,</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> peace and genuine soul." ...|$|R
60|$|The world <b>of</b> the <b>senses</b> is a {{world of}} shows; it does not exist for itself, but has a {{symbolic}} character; and a true prudence or law of shows recognizes the co-presence of other laws and knows that its own office is subaltern; knows that it is surface and not centre where it works.

He is the poet-painter of the Renaissance; he fills his pages with descriptions of airy loveliness, as Italian artists covered the high ceilings of Venice with the reflected splendor {{of earth and}} heaven. Moreover, his <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>beauty</b> found expression in such harmonious lines that one critic describes him as having set beautiful figures moving to exquisite music.|$|R
40|$|Understanding the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{icon and}} its {{theology}} implies a philosophical approach of knowledge. The image, almost {{the most important}} concept in Orthodoxy, is a relation based on a sort of dialectic: the image {{is and is not}} the model. This way of thinking uses a logic of inclusion; it escapes the classical logic of exclusion of opposites in western philosophy. We have to think with «and» instead of «or». The Byzantine way of thinking has stood in the very middle of the opposition between the nominalism and realism of western thought since Middle Ages, especially with the theology of divine energies <b>of</b> Palamas. Two <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>beauty</b> appear: the ancient <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>beauty</b> as revelation or sign of divinity; and the modern sense, revealed after the Renaissance, as the real and unique goal of artistic production, independently of the model or the spectator. In the Byzantine tradition, the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> the artistic tradition used in the liturgy is a sort of icon of the Holy Spirit that supports the Word, which inspires Him. This art is dedicated to a sacred function, as sacrament. Icon belongs to the sacramental life of Church. In addition, it represents a middle-term between God and man. The <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> art is a way of feeling the mysterious presence of God. So, the icon may be, indeed, in that double reality of image, a relative epiphany <b>of</b> the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> God – not as a historical theophany as related in the Bible, but as an indirect image of the mystery of God...|$|R

50|$|A {{queen of}} two kingdoms, Margaret was {{subjected}} to many political manipulations, including being held prisoner (albeit at a comfortable castle) by her own brother, Henry III of France, for many years.

She was indeed {{one of the most}} fashionable women of her time, and influenced many of Europe's royal courts with her clothing. Margaret took many lovers both during her marriage and after its annulment, of whom the best-known are Joseph Boniface de La Môle, Jacques de Harlay, Seigneur de Champvallon and Louis de Bussy d'Amboise. While imprisoned, she took advantage of the time to write her memoirs, which included a succession of stories relating to the disputes of her brothers Charles IX and Henry III with her husband.
