Homogeneous catalyst employed in the current production process is also replaced by Amberlyst 36, a heterogeneous catalyst to eliminate the complications in product separation and the occurrence of side reaction. This work presents the synthesis of <b>bio-lubricant,</b> 2 -ethylhexyl pelargonate through the esterification of pelargonic acid and 2 -ethylhexanol. In this study, a batch reactor completed with dean stark apparatus was used to study the effect of important operating parameters such as mixing speed, temperature, reactant ratio and catalyst loading. The samples withdrawn were titrated for its total acid number (TAN) and the best condition to achieve highest conversion was attained. It {{was found that the}} mixing speed of 300 rpm has minimised the external mass transfer resistances. Under the external diffusion-free regime, the maximum conversion, 96 % was achieved at the temperature of 140 oC, catalyst loading of 2. 5 wt% and reactant molar ratio of pelargonic acid to 2 -ethylhexanol of 1 : 5.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of three <b>bio-lubricant</b> base oil candidates with seventeen combinations of surface treatment was studied, comparing wear scar volumes and {{coefficient of friction}} results. Substrates were initially ground, then a combination of superfinished, Dymon-iC™ DLC, an impact technique of ultra-fine shot blasting method doped with Tin and Molybdenum Disulfide, a calcium based chemical dip containing calcium sulfate and nano fullerene, were used. DLC is well reported to reduce friction. Some reports suggest wear in coated contacts is independent {{of the type of}} lubricant used, whilst others report that bio-lubricants offer reduced friction and wear in combination with DLC. Shot blasting can also reduce wear and friction, due to the surface dimples acting as lubricant reservoirs, making hydrodynamic lubrication more likely. Previous work has also explored the performance of surface texturing in combination with coatings, some reporting higher friction when surface texturing and DLC is used. As a surface coating, fullerene has been shown to have significantly lower wear and friction than DLC coatings. The calcium based chemical treatment used has no published data. A ball on flat reciprocating wear tester was used with <b>bio-lubricant</b> base oil candidates, jojoba and soybean oil, with a mineral base oil used for comparison.

Synthetic esters produced from the esterification of polyols and fatty acids are the <b>bio-lubricant</b> that can replace the mineral oil based lubricants in several applications. In this study, the synthesis of <b>bio-lubricant,</b> trimethylolpropane (TMP) oleate, using sulfated tin (II) oxide was carried out. TMP oleate is most common and widely used in hydraulic fluids. The heterogeneous sulfated tin (II) oxide has been chosen as catalyst because of the shortcomings of the homogeneous catalysts such as difficulty {{to be separated from}} the products and reused. The sulfated tin (II) oxide was synthesized by precipitation followed by impregnation and characterized for its’ physicochemical properties. The catalytic activity was examined through the esterification of TMP and oleic acid (OA) under constant rate of stirring of 800 rpm, 0. 3 wt. % catalyst with particle diameter of, dp≤ 63 μm to eliminate the resistance of external and internal diffusion. The molar ratio of TMP to oleic acids was varied from 1 : 2. 7 - 1 : 3. 3 and reaction temperature was varied from 120 oC- 180 oC. The TMP oleate synthesized was tested for its total acid number and viscosity. The results indicated that the highest conversion of OA, 91. 2 % was achieved at temperature of 180 oC and the molar ratio of TMP: OA was 1 : 2. 7. Apparently, the reaction temperature has more significant effect on the conversion of OA as compared to molar ratio of reactant, verifying that the reaction is controlled by surface reaction.

Molybdenum sulphide additives are widely known for their antiwear and antifriction capabilities, and is fast becoming one of the main ingredients in lubricants. The preparation steps were modified accordingly to obtain nanosized molybdenum sulphide particles, which allows it to be directly blended into the lubricant to form relatively stable particle dispersion. In order to achieve better dispersion and tribological features, the surface of the inorganic material can be protected using various capping agents. In this research, the surface-capped molybdenum sulphide nanoparticles were synthesised, while various alkyl lengths of fatty acids were used as a capping agent. Hexacarbonylmolybdenum was used as a precursor to synthesise molybdenum (II) acetate, which is an organometallic compound intermediate. This compound was then modified with the capping agent to form capped-surface molybdenum sulphide. The properties of surface-capped molybdenum sulphides were determined using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman Spectroscopy, X-ray Diffractometry (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and Thermal Gravimetric Analyser (TGA).

Homo- and copolymer brushes of oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylates are a relatively new class of these so-called "smart surfaces", whose thermoresponse can be finely tuned.

The thermoresponsive behaviour of the MEO₂MA homopolymer and PPEGMA copolymer brushes were confirmed by 'in situ' ellipsometry, which showed the range of temperatures over which the brushes changed conformation is substantially greater than their free polymer analogues. Ellipsometry measurements of the PPEGMA brush in 500 mM potassium acetate revealed the addition of electrolyte decreased the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). Atomic force microscopy measurements of the PPEGMA brush revealed that above the LCST the brush was initially compliant as it interacted with the approaching tip and the force rapidly increased near zero apparent separation. The different force-distance profile below the brush LCST demonstrates the dependence of brush conformation on temperature. Interestingly, lateral force measurements were distinctly different {{either side of the}} LCST.

Nevertheless the linseed oil, once modified, could present interesting technical properties associated to a biodegradable character. To produce the oil initially contained in the seed cells, the oil industry developed around various pretreatments (mechanic, thermic, enzymatic) aiming at enhancing oil extraction, and expression as a central operation. A solvent extraction is then applied on the produced presscake. The objective {{of this study is to}} propose a new process for efficient oil extraction. This process had to be deprived of organic solvent (ecological aspect) and excessive heat treatment in order to preserve the various components of seed (economic aspect). First, we studied the effect of the seed crushing on expression. An optimal crushing allows to recover 70 % of the initial oil, which is comparable to industrial yield obtai- ned after crushing, cooking and expression. The study of seed maturity on expression highlights the need to have mature and dry seeds. An enzymatic preprocessing allows to discover a technological bolt due to the presence of mucilage (polysaccharides mixture) in the cuticule of seed. In order to extract mucilage, we propose an original solution based on the application of high voltage electric discharges (HVED) in water. In the second time, we sought to understand the phenomena during the electric discharge and calculate the energy consumption. After modeling of damped oscillations, recorded once the electric arc is created, we calculated the useful energy for the creation of the shock waves : the totality of the energy contained in the condenser is released during the discharge. It’s noticebale that only 25 % of this energy are used to generate shock waves. This treatment was then applied to the presscake produced after optimal crushing and expression. The mixture of presscake powder and water is treated by HVED then the resulting suspension is submitted to centrifugation to produce an emulsion as well as a solid residue. We then studied the effect of the pulse repetition frequency on the suspension and the produced emulsion physicochemical properties and on the composi- tion of the final products. The oil extraction kinetics and dry matter kinetics could be established and models are proposed. This process of extraction was finally optimized using an experimental design. Two successive treatments are thus applied by adjusting pH, temperature and mass of water. The total sum of applied impulses for the two treatments remaining constant and equal to 280. The oil extraction is favoured when the suspension is concentrated and the pH close to the average isoelectric pH of proteins of flax. Residues rich in oil (20 % of initial oil) and low in oil (2 % of initial oil) can be produced by adjusting the conditions of treatment. In conclusion, our study allowed us to propose a process with the following stages : crushing, expression, crushing, two treatments per electric discharge followed by centri- fugation. We propose two processes according to the results obtained with a forthcoming study concerning the separation of the produced emulsions. ...|$|R

Today, vegetable oil much desired for its application as lubricant in various application {{because it is a}} renewable resources and has high biodegradability compared mineral oil. Thus,this paper presents an experimental analysis on the tribological behavior for aluminum alloy materials under the effect of sliding speed and different loads, where the apparatus pin on disk has been used to study the performance of tribological performance. The experiments had been performed under different parameters, different loads (10 N, 50 N, 100 N), and constant speeds at 3 m/s. This paper evaluates through pin on disc tribotester using hemispherical pin as workpiece material. The test was tested using double fractionated palm olein (DFPO) as lubricating oil. The results show that load 100 N show high coefficient of friction compared to 10 N and 50 N. Authors found that palm olein has better performance properties in terms of friction reduction (coefficient of friction) and wear resistance (anti-wear properties) at low and high speed. Pin that lubricated with palm olein showed small wear scar diameter compared to the mineral based oil. Therefore, palm olein has possibility to use as a lubricant of mating components...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{degradation}} of environmentally friendly lubricants prevents {{the spread of}} its utilisation in industrial applications. This process can be promoted by frictional heating occurred during accidental contacts of moving parts or star-up and shut-down operations. The use of low friction coatings, like diamond-like carbon (DLC), can offer a solution to these problems. Their low friction properties, high wear resistance and excellent corrosion resistance can prevent the occurrence of such local heat spikes, which will protect the lubricant and hence prolong the lifetime of the tribological system. In this work, a synthetic <b>bio-lubricant</b> has been evaluated and compared with a mineral oil. Combinations with pure and Ti doped DLC coatings were taken into account. In {{order to have a}} proper evaluation of the tribosystem a wide range of conditions have been considered in high frequency reciprocating and unidirectional tests. The Stribeck curve at variable sliding speeds and loads was obtained. In steel/steel contacts friction is clearly lower when synthetic oil is used compared to a mineral based oil, which is not always true with DLC/DLC contacts. As a result of the tribotesting, the best combination of materials was. chosen in order to be validated in a real system (mechanical component in a machine tool), where results confirmed our expectations.

40|$|An equine fetlock joint {{pendulum}} test was studied {{and the influence}} of post mortem time and intra-articular lipid solvent on the viscous frictional response examined. Fresh equine digits (group 1, n = 6 controls; group 2, n = 6 lipid solvent) were mounted on a pendulum tribometer. Assuming that pendular joint damping could be modelled by a harmonic oscillator fluid damping (HOFD), damping time (τ), viscous damping coefficient (c) and friction coefficient (μ) were monitored for 5 h under experimental conditions (400 N; 20 °C). In all experiments, pendular joint damping was found to follow an exponential decay function (R² = 0. 99714), which confirmed that joint damping was fluid. The evolution of τ, c and μ was found to be significantly (P < 0. 05) different in the two groups, with a decrease in τ and an increase in c and μ that was faster and more prominent in digits from group 2. It was concluded that pendular joint damping could be modelled by a HOFD model. The influence of post mortem time on results suggested that, ideally, joint mechanical properties should only be tested on fresh cadavers at the same post mortem time.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerning}} about hydrodynamic lubrication in journal bearing. The research covers three primary areas: {{the formulation of}} an alternative biodegradable biolubricant using renewable resources; the performance evaluation of the formulated oil through a true-scale versatile journal bearing test rig; and the modeling and prediction the behavior of <b>bio-lubricant</b> around the bearing circumference. The {{first part of the}} research is focused upon the formulation of an environmentally-friendly lubricant using vegetable oil with various composition of petroleum base stock. The physico-chemical and tribo-chemical properties of the formulated oil have been analyzed using multiple standards apparatuses. This study provides valuable data to conform an ISO VG 68 hydraulic industrial lubricant by blending 52. 70 % (wt) soybean oil, 40. 55 % (wt) mineral oil, and 6. 75 (%) additive packages. The experimental results clearly demonstrated that the formulated green lubricant was far more efficient than the synthetic lubricant in terms of friction coefficient, wear rates, wear volume loss and worn surface morphologies. However, the green lubricant failed to outperform conventional lubricant with respect to degradation test and wear scar diameter performance. From this study, the use of bio-lubricants as ‘green’ alternatives for machine lubrications will be significant in the reduction of environmental pollution and depletion of natural resources. The second part is about evaluating the performance of this novel <b>bio-lubricant</b> under practical application conditions and also to design a new eco-friendly lubricant-bearing combination in which the end goal was to maximize friction coefficient reduction and safeguard the environment. Two different bearings made of conventional steel and green lead-free materials were tested at various operating conditions. The formulated blend proved its viability as a promising alternate for base oil lubricants for industrial use due to its better performance, lower friction, lower operating temperature and on top of all, its bio-degradability and environment friendliness. This can contribute to reduce the global demand of petroleum-based lubricant substantially. The established lubricant-bearing duo is capable of replacing typical lubricants and bearing materials that include lead with regards to its higher availability and superb performance. The third part of this research is the first attempt to develop high-fidelity mathematical models based on Response Surface Methodology (RSM), which can be used to predict the hydrodynamic lubrication behavior of the bio-oil around the journal bearing circumference. The study employed the response surface methodology (RSM) with Box-Behnken experimental Design technique (BBD) for performing statistical predictions and appraising the influence of the three-level-three-independent variables (i. e. rotational speed, bearing load and oil-feed pressure) on the oil-film key characteristics (i. e. maximum pressure, temperature and bearing friction). Another exceptional aspect of this research was the examination of the embedded interactions among the three key parameters. This facilitated the acquirement of deeper knowledge regarding the significance of every parameter. Finally, a comparative study was conducted between the estimated data generated through RSM based models and the outcomes developed through fiizzy logic technique. The comparison showed that RSM offers an extensive variety of information on the control and response variables interrelationships, with {{a relatively small number of}} test runs. It is expected that the results of this research can be fairly helpful to the tribological community in general and the bearing designers in particular...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{aimed at}} {{developing}} heterogeneous catalysts for the esterification of oleic acid (OA) with trimethylolpropane (TMP) {{to produce an}} automotive <b>bio-lubricant</b> -trimethylolpropane trioleate (TMPTO). Four groups of catalysts were studied: 1) heteropolyacids (HPA) immobilized onto silica; 2) macroporous Si(HIPE) functionalized with different species (HPA, SO 3 H-/PO 3 H 2 -, zirconium phosphates); 3) functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNP); and 4) commercial cation ion-exchange resins. Precisely, we developed a method for the strong immobilization of the HPA onto silica via a link of zirconia and obtained stable-toward-leaching catalysts (first group of catalysts) which can be easily recycled for the further uses. The Si(HIPE) -materials (second group) have convenient shape that makes them easy to operate but they inhibited the reaction due to entrapment of the reagents and products inside their small pores. The work dedicated to MNP (third group) investigated different approaches to protect MNP for the use at the low pH. We found that silica coating of MNP as well as organic silane grafting promote the MNP stability. The surface of coated and grafted MNP was then modified with sulfonic moieties. The MNP-catalysts are recoverable by magnet, active and recyclable. Concerning the ion-exchange resins (fourth group), they possess unique stability and recyclability showing potential for the industrial applications. For the gel-type resin, a so-called “pre-swelling” step was developed to increase the productivity of the resin. We {{also found that the}} resins catalyze the formation of mono- and diesters, whereas the final triester is generated thanks to the action of acidity from the residual OA at the high temperature of the system. A cooperative scenario between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis is proposed for operating the industrial reaction starting with an ion-exchange resin at low temperature and completing it at higher temperature to obtain the triester.

The government has to import large volumes of fuel from foreign sources to meet the fuel demand for power production, causing {{a negative impact on}} the country's economy. Finding an alternative to fossil fuels is becoming the most urgent issue. Biodiesel can thus be a destined source to future energy demands. Increasing the usage of biodiesel will also decrease the global problem of environmental pollution, as fossil fuels are considered to be the major source of harmful emissions. Biodiesel is renewable, bio-degradable, non-toxic, technologically feasible, and {{can be used as a}} <b>bio-lubricant</b> In this study, the current energy scenario of Bangladesh, available potential biodiesel feedstocks, production process and engine fuel property, environmental impact, performance and emission characteristics on diesel engines, comparison of cost analysis, and future direction are discussed. Various research related to these feedstocks are performed in Bangladesh, which include an overview of biodiesel properties, engine performance, and emission parameters used in diesel engines. All types of biodiesel have similar functional properties compared with diesel fuel and can be successfully used in compression ignition engines. Biodiesel can thus serve as a subsequent replacement of non-renewable fossil fuels. Compared with diesel fuel, CO and HC emission were also low, but a slight increase in NO x was observed in some cases. One of the major advantages is that Bangladesh is a country with plenty of biodiesel feedstock sources, such as mustered, Jatropha curcas, rapeseed, sesame, castor, cottonseed, neem, algae, coconut, and groundnut In conclusion, producing biodiesel from different feedstocks is greatly possible and can thus assist in future energy needs.
