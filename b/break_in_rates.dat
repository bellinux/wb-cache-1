40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide {{evidence}} about the existence or non- existence of structural <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> exchange <b>rates</b> of European transition economies. We used the testing procedure of Vogelsang (1997) that allows for detecting a break at an unknown date in the trend function of a dynamic univariate time series. The procedure does not impose restrictions on the nature of data since it allows trending and unit- root regressors. The results depend in a striking way on the economic climate of a particular country. In Balkan countries, which belong to less stable economies, the measures adopted by monetary authorities indeed brought about a structural <b>break</b> <b>in</b> exchange <b>rate</b> behavior. <b>In</b> more stable transition economies, such as those in Central Europe, the monetary steps tended to stabilize the exchange rate behavior.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} extent to which {{accounting}} for structural <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> ERM exchange <b>rates</b> affects inferences on the presence of a unit root <b>in</b> these exchange <b>rates.</b> Four ERM exchange rates, found by previous empirical studies to be nonstationary, are examined. In contrast to previous empirical studies, multiple structural breaks are allowed for to account for multiple realignments in the central parities of these exchange rates. Bootstrapped critical values, personalized to the pattern of breaks of each exchange rate, are used for statistical inference. Consistent with the theoretical conclusion by Froot and Obstfeld (1991), the results suggest that all four ERM exchange rates are stationary. Therefore, accounting for <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> ERM exchange <b>rates</b> does affect inferences on the presence of a unit root <b>in</b> these exchange <b>rates.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the unit-root property of the Australian short- and long-term interest rates using unit-root tests that accommodate a single or two breaks under the null and/or alternative hypothesis. Two <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> interest <b>rates</b> are found {{to coincide with the}} 1982 / 83 and 1990 / 91 recessions or the 1993 inflation targeting period. We further investigate the implications of these structural breaks on the cointegrating relationship implied by the single, linear expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates. While there is evidence that the data are consistent with the expectations hypothesis at the shorter end of the term structure, <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> interest <b>rates</b> generate a shift in the cointegrating relationship, thus altering the information content of the term structure. Failing to account for a regime shift in the cointegration regression, the data erroneously supports the expectations hypothesis at the longer end of the term structure. These results have profound implications for policy makers who may inadequately exploit the information content of the term structure to predict future changes in inflation. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} U. S. {{business}} cycle dynamics considering time-variations and breaks predominantly {{associated with the}} Great Recession in the late 2000 s. In the first essay, I evaluate the predictive content of financial variables and unconventional monetary policy measures for the U. S. output growth and inflation before, during, and after the Great Recession from 1960 ? 2015. I compare the local forecasting performances of the variables with attention to the Great Recession period when the Federal Reserve System and market participants {{were not able to}} use the federal funds rate for a policy instrument and a leading indicator for the economy. This shows that the predictive ability of the credit spread, stock price, and market expectation measures for output growth and inflation change significantly increased during the Great Recession. The result is consistent with the idea that the Great Recession was primarily driven by a financial shock, and that financial condition measures might be useful indicators for the future economy to investors and central bankers. Additionally, it is important that financial market conditions are not exacerbated by a future economic shock to avoid a vicious cycle. In the second essay, I examine how the conditional volatilities of the U. S. macroeconomic variables have changed before and during the Great Recession considering conditional mean changes. I implement multiple structural <b>break</b> tests <b>in</b> a reduced form model to find structural changes in the volatilities and means of the variables using the data from 1960 ? 2015. The test results show that the increase in the volatility in the economy during the Great Recession was temporary, and there was no structural <b>break</b> <b>in</b> the growth <b>rate</b> of GDP during the Great Recession. But, there was a structural <b>break</b> <b>in</b> the growth <b>rates</b> of consumption variables, which are major parts of the economy, and demand-related variables, such as real disposable income and liabilities of consumers. A simulation result ii suggests that a structural <b>break</b> <b>in</b> the growth <b>rate</b> of the economy might have occurred before the Great Recession if the recent sluggish economy continues in the coming years. This evidence suggests that the monetary policy in the period of the Great Moderation might be reconsidered for the sustainable growth of the economy beyond the short-run, and policy for improving the recent sluggish economy, especially consumption, might be necessary to avoid a structural decline <b>in</b> the growth <b>rate</b> of the economy...|$|R
