50|$|<b>Blepharochalasis</b> is {{idiopathic}} in most cases, i.e., {{the cause}} is unknown. Systemic conditions linked to <b>blepharochalasis</b> are renal agenesis, vertebral abnormalities, and congenital heart disease.|$|E
50|$|Dermatochalasis is {{sometimes}} confused with <b>blepharochalasis,</b> {{but these are}} two different conditions.|$|E
50|$|These {{are used}} to correct atrophic <b>blepharochalasis</b> after the {{syndrome}} has run its course.|$|E
50|$|Complications of <b>blepharochalasis</b> {{may include}} conjunctival hyperemia (excessive blood {{flow through the}} moist tissues of the orbit), chemosis, entropion, ectropion, and ptosis.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Blepharochalasis</b> : Recurrent {{episodes of}} {{swelling}} cause stretching and atrophy {{of the upper}} eyelid skin. This results in the relaxation of the tarsal fold allowing tissue to slack over the palpebral fissure. In severe cases, the lower eyelid is also involved.|$|E
5000|$|Eyelid edema is a {{condition}} in which the eyelids are swollen and tissues contain excess fluid. It may affect eye function when it increases the intraocular pressure. Eyelid edema is caused by allergy, trichiasis or infections. The main symptoms are swollen red eyelids, pain, and itching. Chronic eyelid edema can lead to <b>blepharochalasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Blepharochalasis</b> is an {{inflammation}} of the eyelid that is characterized by exacerbations and remissions of eyelid edema, which results in a stretching and subsequent atrophy of the eyelid tissue, leading {{to the formation of}} redundant folds over the lid margins. It typically affects only the upper eyelids, and may be unilateral as well as bilateral.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blepharochalasis</b> {{results from}} {{recurrent}} bouts of painless eyelid swelling, each lasting for several days. This {{is thought to}} be a form of localized angioedema, or rapid accumulation of fluid in the tissues. Recurrent episodes lead to thin and atrophic skin. Damage to the levator palpebrae superioris muscle causes ptosis, or drooping of the eyelid, when the muscle can no longer hold the eyelid up.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE To report {{clinical}} {{profile of}} <b>blepharochalasis</b> {{and assess the}} surgical outcomes of levator reattachment in chronic <b>blepharochalasis.</b> METHODOLOGY A retrospective chart review of 13 patients with acute and chronic <b>blepharochalasis</b> was made and the diagnosis was made based on the typical clinical findings. Patients with acute <b>blepharochalasis</b> were managed conservatively those with chronic <b>blepharochalasis</b> underwent levator reattachment surgery for the correction of blepharoptosis. RESULTS Age at presentation varied from 8 years to 13 years with no sex predilection. 4 patients presented in the acute stage and 9 patients presented in the chronic stage. All patients in the chronic stage had blepharoptosis along with other features of connective tissue laxity and underwent levator reattachment surgery with good postoperative outcomes. CONCLUSION In the acute stages, <b>blepharochalasis</b> is managed conservatively. However, in the chronic stages, management is essentially surgical. Levator reattachment is an excellent surgical procedure, which provides satisfactory postoperative outcomes. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{rare case}} of {{bilateral}} <b>blepharochalasis</b> {{of the upper}} eyelids is presented in a 10 -year-old boy with several systemic abnormalities [...] unilateral agenesis of the left kidney, multiple skeletal anomalies of the vertebral column, and congenital heart disease with a left to right shunt. Such widespread congenital defects in association with <b>blepharochalasis</b> have not been described before. <b>Blepharochalasis</b> may represent {{a part of a}} more generalised disorder...|$|E
40|$|Two {{cases of}} <b>blepharochalasis</b> were studied. In Case 1, a 16 -year-old male {{presented}} with the history and clinical features of <b>blepharochalasis.</b> A positive tissue biopsy for matrix metalloproteinases suggested a benefit from treatment with doxycycline. The patient remained disease-free for 18 months following commencement of doxycycline. In Case 2, a 21 -year-old male with a 5 -month history of swelling affecting his upper eyelids was diagnosed with <b>blepharochalasis.</b> He received an 8 -month course of doxycycline and remained symptom-free on review 2 months after treatment cessation. While the pathogenesis of <b>blepharochalasis</b> has remained uncertain, an immune mechanism has been suspected. The presence of matrix metalloproteinases in the tissue biopsy of our first patient supports such an immune mechanism. As doxycycline inhibits matrix metalloproteinase activity, it may provide an effective and well-tolerated treatment alternative for cases of <b>blepharochalasis</b> for which surgery has previously been the only treatment option. 3 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} a rare case of <b>blepharochalasis</b> that progressed from unilateral to bilateral involvement at {{five years after}} disease onset. Case Report: A previously healthy five-year-old white boy presented to our hospital for a screening visual examination. He {{was found to have}} a 2 -mm right eyelid ptosis with crepe-like skin and subcutaneous telangiectatic vessels. His mother noted that since the age of three, the child has been having two to seven day-long episodes of right upper eyelid swelling and edema with tenderness. The episodes eventually progressed to involving the left eyelid as well. Oral steroid taper was found to effectively resolve these exacerbations, and a diagnosis of <b>blepharochalasis</b> was made. Conclusion: <b>Blepharochalasis</b> should be in the differential diagnosis for young children presenting with unilateral or bilateral ptosis with periorbital skin abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|To {{report the}} first case of {{lacrimal}} gland fistula after upper eyelid blepharoplasty for <b>blepharochalasis.</b> Standard upper blepharoplasty and the hooding excision were performed in a female with <b>blepharochalasis.</b> The patient developed a fistulous tract with tearing from the incision few days after hooding excision. Fistula excision and lacrimal gland repositioning were performed. There were no complications after the repositioning procedure (6 months follow up). Prolapsed lacrimal gland and fistula formation can occur after upper blepharoplasty hooding excision...|$|E
40|$|A 59 -year-old {{woman with}} massive {{bilateral}} edema {{of the upper}} and lower eyelids is presented. The edema occurred suddenly and without provocation. No cause could be identified despite a multitude of examinations. Initially the patient was diagnosed as having <b>blepharochalasis,</b> but later skin biopsy suggested an acquired form of cutis laxa. Most likely the cutis laxa was a result of angio-edema, Pharmacological treatment was not successful, but surgical intervention provided an acceptable result. The differential diagnosis of periorbital edema is discussed with special attention to cutis laxa, angio-edema, and <b>blepharochalasis...</b>|$|E
40|$|A 13 {{year old}} girl {{presented}} with aesthetic deformity of upper lip since birth. She also presented with eyelid swelling {{on and off}} for 11 months. She was diagnosed to be a rare case of Ascher syndrome. Ascher syndrome commonly presents with double lip and <b>blepharochalasis,</b> sometimes associated with goitre. The deformity of her double upper lip was corrected by appropriate surgery. Because her <b>blepharochalasis</b> is in active stage now, she is under periodic follow up for appropriate intervention. This article describes the management of the patient and brief overview of the syndrome. Ascher syndrome is often missed or misdiagnosed commonly...|$|E
40|$|<b>Blepharochalasis</b> is an {{uncommon}} disorder distinguished by recurrent episodes of eyelid oedema in young patients. A hypertrophic form, manifested as fat herniation, and an atrophic form, manifested as fat atrophy, have been described. Ptosis with excellent levator function, laxity of the lateral canthal structures with rounding of the lateral canthal angle, nasal fat pad atrophy, and redundant eyelid skin develop after many episodes of eyelid swelling. Fine wrinkling, atrophy, and telangiectasias characterise the excess eyelid skin. We describe four cases of this syndrome in which external levator aponeurosis tuck, blepharoplasty, lateral canthoplasty, and dermis fat grafts {{were used to}} correct atrophic <b>blepharochalasis</b> after the syndrome had run its course...|$|E

40|$|<b>Blepharochalasis</b> {{is a rare}} eyelid {{disorder}} that often presents in childhood or early adolescence. It is characterized by exacerbations and remissions of painless edema of the upper and occasionally lower eyelids. Although the average duration of attack is only two days, multiple attacks eventually lead to atrophic, wrinkled, and discolored periorbital skin. Other clinical manifestations include ptosis, acquired forms of blepharophimosis, lower lid retraction, pseudoepicanthal folds, proptosis, prolapse of orbital fat, and lacrimal tissue. The etiology of <b>blepharochalasis</b> {{has yet to be}} fully elucidated, but histpathologic examinations indicate that elastolytic activity, immunoglobulin A (IgA), and other inflammatory processes might play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of the disease. The treatment of blepharchalasis is primarily surgical, and therefore understanding the natural history is essential to avoid overcorrection and recurrences after surgery.

40|$|A double-lip is an {{infrequent}} anomaly {{which may}} occur either isolated or {{as a component}} of Ascher's syndrome. Apart from a deformity that may interfere with speech and mastication, surgery may be indicated for cosmetic reasons. We present a case of a male patient with an acquired double lip and <b>blepharochalasis.</b> In order to make the differential diagnosis a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. The mass was removed by a transverse elliptical incision under local anesthesia. No post-operative problems occurred and the cosmetic result was good...|$|E
40|$|Ascher’s {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} disease first described in 1920 by Ascher, an ophthalmologist from Prague. The disease {{is characterized by a}} double upper lip, <b>blepharochalasis,</b> and nontoxic thyroid enlargement, though the thyroid enlargement may be evident in only 10 % to 50 % of patients. These deformities, though not posing functional problems, may cause severe psychological distress to the affected person because of the disfiguring effect on smiling.

40|$|Cutis laxa is a {{term that}} refers to {{markedly}} loose skin that is not hyperelastic. It {{is regarded as a}} genetically heterogeneous group of diseases and is presently divided into five types. We report a male patient with type II autosomal recessive disease. The patient was the third child of first-cousin consanguineous, healthy parents. His two siblings died a few hours after birth. One of the siblings also had similar features and wrinkled skin. Our case had markedly loose and wrinkled skin especially over the dorsum of the hands and feet, and on the face and abdomen, dolichocephaly, hypertelorism, <b>blepharochalasis,</b> long filtrum, pectus excavatus, large fontanelles, prominent low-set ears and umbilical hernia.

40|$|Background. To assess Cutler-Beard {{procedure}} {{results in}} patients after wide excision of malignant eyelid tumours. Materials and Methods. The records {{of two women}} and two men (four patients) referred to our clinic with eyelid mass complaints and malign eyelid tumour diagnosis according to the histopathological examination were examined retrospectively. Results. The patients were 60 – 73 years old and their average age was 66 ± 11. 10. The follow-up period of the cases was 16 (6 – 25) months. Total excisional biopsy was applied to all patients and then Cutler-Beard full thickness lid reconstruction was done because of the wide localization of the tumour. The patients’ diagnoses were consistent with basal cell carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, eyelid lymphoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. The patients’ eyelids were separated from each other 1 month postoperatively with a second operation. Superior eyelid entropium and <b>blepharochalasis</b> were seen in one patient during followup. Conclusions. Cutler-Beard flap is a successful procedure for superior eyelid tumours accompanied by wide tissue loss. The long-time closure of the eyelids {{and the need for}} secondary surgery are the major disadvantages of this procedure. Our experience with this procedure will reveal better results with large case series...|$|E
40|$|Background Non-incisional {{blepharoplasty}} is a simple, less invasive {{method for}} creating a more natural-appearing double eyelid than classical incisional blepharoplasty. However, in aging patients, non-incisional blepharoplasty is not effective due to more severe <b>blepharochalasis.</b> Traditionally, incisional blepharoplasty is a common surgical method used for older patients, but blepharoplasty in elderly patients typically results in prolonged recovery times, and final blepharoplasty lines may be located in unintended or asymmetrical positions. Here, we introduce a new modified combination technique for geriatric blepharoplasty. Methods A total of ten patients were treated from July 2010 through July 2012 using the combination method. First, we performed non-incisional blepharoplasty using tarsodermal fixation. Then, incisional blepharoplasty with additional elliptical excision of the upper eyelid skin was performed. We removed pretarsal tissue, fat, the orbicularis oculi muscle, and orbital fat. Telephone surveys were administered to all patients for follow-up. The questionnaire was composed of eight questions that addressed recurrence and satisfaction with aesthetics and the procedure. Results A total of nine patients (90 %) responded to the telephone survey. All cases of moderate to severe blepharochalasia were corrected {{and there were no}} major complications. Patients who underwent blepharoplasty had higher satisfaction scores. All patients were satisfied with the postoperative shapes of their eyelids. Conclusions The advantages of the proposed technique include: ease of obtaining a natural-looking fold with symmetry at the desired point; reproducible methods that require short operation times; fast postoperative recovery that results in a natural-appearing double-eyelid line; and high patient satisfaction...|$|E
