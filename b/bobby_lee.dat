He averaged 19.1 points and 17.9 rebounds per game and led his team to a 26–3 record en route to the state semifinals.

Alito wrote for a unanimous court in ordering a new trial for <b>Bobby</b> <b>Lee</b> Holmes due to South Carolina's rule that barred such evidence based on the strength of the prosecution's case, rather than on the relevance and strength of the defense evidence itself. His other majority opinions in his first term were in Zedner v. United States, Woodford v. Ngo, and Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy.|$|E

2500|$|A panicky local Association {{restricted}} {{international competition}} in 1990, turning the race {{into a sort}} of contest for a [...] "Great Belizean Hope" [...] to bring down the Americans. He turned out to be Charles Lewis, who smashed Zauner's record and evoked memories of strong performances from previous champions. When McCannon led a team of Americans back to Belize in 1991, the nation pinned its hopes on Lewis to defeat them. He came through, breaking his own record and restoring the nation's pride. Lewis' effort began a sort of Belizean [...] "renaissance" [...] that lasted through 1995, as brother Michael, Collet [...] "Bunas" [...] Maheia, Orlando Chavarria and contenders Nigel Matus, Fred Usher and others defended Belize's honor. Adding to the memories was a pair of exciting and controversial finishes. In 1993, Roque Matus thought he had the race won, similar to Edward Miguel in 1961, and stopped riding after crossing the finish line at the BTL Park (formerly Ramada Park)-only it wasn't; this allowed Maheia to attack and win. The line was apparently left over from municipal elections work earlier that year. In 1994, the scene shifted south to the Yabra area. After Charles Lewis claimed first place over American <b>Bobby</b> <b>Lee,</b> brother Michael began the sprint for third- and crashed into a slow moving truck belonging to local communication company BTL and holding broadcasters from KREM FM covering the finish. The oncoming peloton could not avoid the melee and a huge spill developed which was blamed on the broadcasters.|$|E
6000|$|General Lee, who {{had led the}} Army of Northern Virginia in {{all these}} contests, was a very highly {{estimated}} man in the Confederate army and States, and filled also a very high place in the estimation {{of the people and}} press of the Northern States. His praise was sounded throughout the entire North after every action he was engaged in: the number of his forces was always lowered and that of the National forces exaggerated. He was a large, austere man, and I judge difficult of approach to his subordinates. To be extolled by the entire press of the South after every engagement, and by a portion of the press North with equal vehemence, was calculated to give him the entire confidence of his troops and to make him feared by his antagonists. It was not an uncommon thing for my staff-officers to hear from Eastern officers, [...] "Well, Grant has never met <b>Bobby</b> <b>Lee</b> yet." [...] There were good and true officers who believe now that the Army of Northern Virginia was superior to the Army of the Potomac man to man. I do not believe so, except as the advantages spoken of above made them so. Before the end I believe the difference was the other way. The Army of Northern Virginia became despondent and saw the end. It did not please them. The National army saw the same thing, and were encouraged by it.|$|E
