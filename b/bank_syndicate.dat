40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{decision}} of lead investment banks to organize hybrid <b>syndicates</b> (commercial <b>banks</b> participating as co-managers) versus pure investment <b>bank</b> <b>syndicates.</b> The findings show that hybrid underwriting issues are more challenging to float. Compared to pure investment <b>bank</b> <b>syndicates,</b> hybrid syndicates serve clients that are smaller, have lower common stock rankings and less prior access to the capital markets, rely more on bank loans, and invest less capital but issue larger amounts, which indicates that commercial banks' participation enhances hybrid services. Moreover, lead investment banks tend to invite banks' participation when clients exhibit higher loyalty in reusing their services. Copyright 2004 by The American Finance Association. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the role that {{institutions}} may play in enabling banks to write contracts whereby sovereign debt is not forgiven ex post. Our model provides a rationale {{for the emergence of}} a centralized forum for debt renegotiation, such as the London Club as well as for <b>bank</b> <b>syndicates.</b> These <b>bank</b> <b>syndicates</b> arise as part of a pre-commitment device rather than risk sharing. We propose a debt contract under which, only involuntary default is forgiven ex post. Our main findings are that under this contract, renegotiations take place only after involuntary default and debt forgiveness after voluntary (strategic) default is avoided. When voluntary default occurs, access to the credit market is denied only for a limited number of periods, rather than forever. In contrast to a voluntary default, involuntary default is renegotiated immediately. Default; Sovereign debt;...|$|R

Performance pricing covenants under which borrowers commence to pay higher spreads if ratios (or credit ratings) deteriorate constitute a positive signal reducing agency costs and are associated with higher proportions of syndication.
