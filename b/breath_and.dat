5|$|Ascetic {{practices}} (tapas), {{concentration and}} bodily postures used by Vedic priests to conduct yajna (sacrifice), {{might have been}} precursors to yoga. Vratya, a group of ascetics mentioned in the Atharvaveda, emphasized on bodily postures which may have evolved into yogic asanas. Early Samhitas also contain references to other group ascetics such as munis, the keśin, and vratyas. Techniques for controlling <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> vital energies are mentioned in the Brahmanas (texts of the Vedic corpus, c. 1000–800 BCE) and the Atharvaveda.

5|$|Lung cancer, {{also known}} as lung carcinoma, is a {{malignant}} lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. This growth can spread beyond the lung {{by the process of}} metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> chest pains.|$|E
5|$|Oral hygiene is the {{practice}} of keeping the mouth clean and {{is a means of}} preventing dental caries, gingivitis, periodontal disease, bad <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> other dental disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E

40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. A sudden {{unexpected}} death during epilepsy (SUDEP) {{can occur}} to an unattended epilepsy sufferer. The cessation {{of heart and}} breathing activity is associated with SUDEP. Therefore, developing a heart and breathing monitoring system that could alarm when an epilepsy patient experiences cessation of heart or breathing activity is necessary. This system will assist healthcare providers {{to respond to the}} emergency and prevent sudden death. This collaborative project is to investigate the feasibility of developing a miniature, unobtrusive, and self-contained module that an epilepsy patient could wear in bed and a small bedside alarm unit intended to alert healthcare providers to prevent SUDEP. The wearable unit communicates wirelessly occurrences of <b>breaths</b> <b>and</b> heartbeats to the bedside unit. The bedside unit alerts upon cessation of heart or breathing activity. This project assumed that the monitor receives an input voltage from a small strip of piezoelectric film made of polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) attached to the patient???s chest. The PVDF sensor voltage changes in response both to the chest expansion and contraction of breathing and to the chest vibrations caused by heartbeats. In the first stage of this project, human subject recordings of PVDF, strain-gauge plethysmography (SPG),and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals were analyzed to determine how to design the signal processing needed to separate out individual breathing and heartbeat signals. Then, low-power analog, microcontroller, and wireless technologies were used to build a prototype of the wearable module to separate out the breathing and heartbeat signals, detect individual <b>breaths</b> <b>and</b> heartbeats, and telemeter the detected <b>breaths</b> <b>and</b> heartbeats to the bedside unit. A prototype of the bedside unit was built using similar technologies to receive the occurrences of heartbeats <b>and</b> <b>breaths</b> from the wearable module. This unit also calculates heart and breathing rates and determines whether or not to alarm if breaths or heartbeats cease or the wireless link fails to function. For convenience, the wearable module and bedside unit were prototyped using bread-boarded circuitry and commercial development boards containing the miniature electronic components. Once feasibility is shown, the wearable module and bedside unit can be compacted by incorporating the miniature electronic components directly into custom integrated circuits. The performance of the signal processing algorithm to separate out breathing and heartbeat signals and to detect individual <b>breaths</b> <b>and</b> heartbeats was tested by using the algorithm to process PVDF recordings from human subjects and comparing the results with SPG recordings of <b>breaths</b> <b>and</b> PPG recordings of heartbeats from the same human subjects. Miss Swetha Seshu Ayyagari designed the hardware for the signal conditioning circuit and the software for digital signal processing to separate out the breathing and heartbeat signals from the PVDF signal. Mr. Pritam Rajendra Chopda designed the software to detect individual <b>breaths</b> <b>and</b> heartbeats, transmit detected <b>breaths</b> <b>and</b> heartbeats to the bedside unit, calculate heart and breathing rate, and alert upon cessation of heartbeats or breathing or wireless link failure. Prototypes were successfully built of the wearable module and bedside unit. The prototype wearable module was capable of processing an incoming PVDF signal, separating out breathing and heartbeat signals, detecting individual <b>breaths</b> <b>and</b> heartbeats, and wirelessly transmitting them to the bedside unit. The prototype bedside unit was capable of alarming if breaths or heartbeats stopped or if the wireless link failed. On six 22 -s PVDF recordings, percentage of peaks correctly detected as breaths (true positive) is 64...|$|R

In March, Edwards appeared as Holofernes in Love's Labour's Lost at Augustin Daly's Daly Theatre, but was often short of <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> unable {{to keep pace with the}} run—his part was given to a young Tyrone Power who also covered Edwards' old role of Sir Oliver Surface for Daly's road show of The School for Scandal.|$|E
5|$|There was no autopsy, and {{the cause}} of Lambert's death is unknown. While many sources say that he died of a fatty {{degeneration}} of the heart or of stress on his heart caused by his bulk, his behaviour in the period leading to his death does not match that of someone suffering from cardiac insufficiency; witnesses agree that on the morning of his death he appeared well, before he became short of <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> collapsed. Bondeson(2006) speculates that the most consistent explanation of his death, given his symptoms and medical history, is that he had a sudden pulmonary embolism.|$|E
5|$|When he {{returned}} to Kentucky following the 37th Congress, Crittenden's health was failing, and he frequently complained of shortness of <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> chest pain. He had determined to retire from Congress, but once again, friends persuaded him to stand for re-election. Shortly after his nomination, Crittenden {{and his wife were}} en route to an alum spring in Indiana to seek treatment to alleviate the symptoms of his failing health when he collapsed in Louisville. After remaining bedfast at the home of a local doctor, {{he returned}} home to Frankfort, where he died on July 26, 1863. He was interred at the State Cemetery in Frankfort. Among his other notable kinsmen were nephews Thomas Theodore Crittenden, congressman from Missouri, and Thomas Turpin Crittenden, a general in the Union Army. In Kentucky, Crittenden County and the town of Crittenden are named for him.|$|E

5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} burns on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 0.1ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3ppm. The exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 3ppm. Bromine is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a stroke}} {{at a family}} reunion in Tallahassee, Florida, in September 1989, Roddenberry's health {{declined}} further, ultimately requiring him to use a wheelchair. Following another stroke in early October 1991, his right arm was paralyzed, causing him ongoing pain as the muscles began to atrophy. It also caused problems with the sight in his right eye and he found communicating in full sentences difficult. At 2:00pm, on October 24, he attended an appointment with his doctor, Dr. Ronald Rich. He arrived in the building with his staff, and began to travel up to the ninth floor in the elevator. As they reached the fifth floor, he began struggling for <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> was wheeled into the doctor's office, where he was reclined and a nurse administered oxygen. Barrett was sent for. Upon her arrival, she held Roddenberry while encouraging him to breathe. He had a cardiopulmonary arrest, and {{he died in the}} doctor's office shortly afterwards. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was attempted with no effect, and paramedics arrived to take him across the road to the Santa Monica Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} {{there may be}} an {{asymptomatic}} phase following the initial symptoms which is then followed by more significant toxicity including kidney damage, liver damage, and neurological dysfunction including seizures and coma. These signs usually develop within 1–3days in serious cases. The patient develops jaundice and the liver and spleen become enlarged, in some cases blood sugar levels will rise (hyperglycemia) and then fall (hypoglycemia) and liver toxicity is seen. Additionally intravascular hemolysis causes destruction of red blood cells resulting in increase in free hemoglobin and hemoglobinuria which can lead to renal toxicity or renal failure. Methemoglobinemia may also occur in some cases. This is where higher than normal levels of methemoglobin, which is a form of hemoglobin that can not carry oxygen, are found in the blood. It causes the patient to become short of <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> cyanotic. Cases of severe poisoning may progress to a terminal neurological phase, with delirium, muscle fasciculations and seizures, and mydriasis progressing to coma, circulatory collapse, and respiratory arrest. Death may occur from five to seven days after consumption.|$|E
