Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, {{and said}} he began the script to try to {{understand}} [...] "how someone could be inspired to kill anyone as a result of being exposed to this kind of beautiful art. It really <b>bothered</b> <b>me,</b> because Lennon and Salinger have always made me feel so much better, and so much less alone." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{resolved}} that {{at thirty}} I would {{know more about}} poetry than any man living... that I would know what was accounted poetry everywhere, what part of poetry was 'indestructible', what part could not be lost by translation and—scarcely less important—what effects were obtainable in one language only and were utterly incapable of being translated.In this search I learned more or less of nine foreign languages, I read Oriental stuff in translations, I fought every University regulation and every professor who tried to make me learn anything except this, or who <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> with [...] "requirements for degrees".|$|E
500|$|Australian Rules {{football}} {{was also a}} big part of Ponting's sporting life; during winter he played junior football for North Launceston and until he was 14, it could have become a possible sporting option, before he broke the humerus in his right arm playing for North Launceston Under–17s. Ponting's arm was so badly damaged {{that it had to be}} pinned. Told to endure a 14-week lay-off, he never played competitive football again. He later wrote: [...] "At one stage I was concerned that the arm injury might also stop me from playing cricket but they [...] did a pretty good job on pinning the bones—and it hasn't <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> since." ...|$|E

500|$|Neval later {{explained}} [...] "My {{initial reaction}} to the part was surprise as Neighbours {{have never had a}} gay character. But the nature of the character never really <b>bothered</b> <b>me.</b> My only real concern was that the story would not be told in a sensationalist or distasteful way. She's not a stereotypical character and being gay is certainly not the only interesting thing about her." [...] Neval made her first screen appearance as Lana during the episode broadcast on 30 August 2004. In April 2005, Eliza Taylor-Cotter said that she had originally auditioned for the role of Lana, before joining the cast as Janae Timmins.|$|E
500|$|Fleury {{remained}} {{embroiled in}} controversy at the 2005 Allan Cup tournament. The Thunder were repeatedly accused of paying players despite being an amateur team, and Fleury angrily denied rumours {{that he was}} secretly being paid $100,000. Tournament fans were extremely hostile towards the Thunder, and after it was eliminated in the semi-finals Fleury accused them of racism and threatened to return his 2002 Olympic gold medal: [...] "The one thing that's really <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> through {{this whole thing is}} the prejudice, still, in this country when it comes to native people. I've seen it first-hand in every building we go into, how these people are treated, and it's absolutely embarrassing to be a Canadian and know that stuff is still going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Cotto's next {{scheduled}} {{match was}} against the then-undefeated Paul Malignaggi in a fight that took place on June 10, 2006 in Madison Square Garden. Cotto opened a cut over Malignaggi's right eye in the first round, which, according to Malignaggi, affected his performance {{over the course of}} the fight, by stating [...] "this was the first time in which I was cut, and the blood kept going into my eye. And it <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> the entire fight. I was not able to see very well. Cotto's a great fighter, but I'm disappointed, as I wanted to be the champion". Cotto won the fight by unanimous decision with scores of 116-111 and 115-112. Malignaggi suffered a fractured right orbital bone and his jaw was injured, he was taken to Roosevelt Hospital after the fight's outcome was announced.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Rough Guides in 2006, Chris Ingham said Harrison was [...] "rightly annoyed" [...] {{with his}} former record company. Ingham added that, with the [...] "excellent Volume II" [...] (Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989) no longer in print, The Best of George Harrison was {{therefore}} the artist's only available compilation album and [...] "hardly a satisfying one-stop sampler". Reviewing Let It Roll for the music website Popdose, in 2009, Jon Cummings wrote that [...] "the compilation gods have never been kind to [...] " [...] and described the 1976 album as [...] "downright insulting". In her role as compiler of Let It Roll, Harrison's widow Olivia said of The Best of George Harrison: [...] "That album always <b>bothered</b> <b>me...</b> I just thought that is really not fair and I {{think we have to}} put something in that place, and that's really what this [...] is." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt DeTruck of The Rochester City Newspaper wrote, [...] "Menzel {{should be}} {{credited}} for providing as much power and passion to this performance {{as she did}} in her most famous role." [...] Donald Clark of Irish Times added, [...] "Elsa's flight to the glaciers triggers a song that, in its defiant paean to self-reliance, could play comfortably beside camp showtune anthems such as I Am What I Am and Don't Rain on My Parade. The opening and closing choruses of Let It Go end with a sly, spat-out refrain: 'The cold never <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> anyway!' You go, girl." [...] Nasim Asl of The Oxford Student continued, [...] "Menzel, especially, steals the show with her performance of 'Let It Go'. Her Wicked-esque belting out works perfectly with such an incredible animated sequence—the building of the ice castle really demonstrates the prowess of Disney animation, and results in, arguably, {{one of the most}} spectacular power ballads seen by any animated character, ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Bolt competed {{sparingly}} in the 200m {{before the}} Olympics, with {{a run of}} 19.89 seconds to win at the London Grand Prix being his sole run of note over that distance. He had four races over 100m, though only one was in Europe, and his best of 9.88 seconds in Kingston placed him fourth on the world seasonal rankings. As in the previous season, Gatlin {{appeared to be in}} better form, having seasonal bests of 9.80 and 19.75 seconds to rank first and second in the sprints. Doping in athletics was a prime topic before the 2016 Rio Olympics, given the banning of the Russian track and field team for state doping, and Bolt commented that he had no problem with doping controls: [...] "I have no issue with being drug-tested...I remember in Beijing every other day they were drug-testing us". He also highlighted his dislike of rival Tyson Gay's reduced ban for cooperation, given their close rivalry since the start of Bolt's career, saying [...] "it really <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> – really, really bothered me".|$|E

500|$|The burning {{aeroplane}} in the book's opening, and the suspicions {{it immediately}} arouses, quickly introduces {{the problems of}} terrorism and international security. The day's political demonstration and the ubiquity of its news coverage provide background noise to Perowne's day, leading to him to ponder his relationship with these events. Christopher Hitchens {{pointed out that the}} novel is set on the [...] "actual day the whole of bien-pensant Britain moved into the streets to jeer at George Bush and Tony Blair" [...] and placed the novel as [...] "unapologetically anchored {{as it is in the}} material world and its several discontents". The Economist newspaper set the context as a [...] "world where terrorism and war make headlines, but also filter into the smallest corners of people's lives." [...] McEwan said himself, [...] "The march gathered not far from my house, and it <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> that so many people seemed so thrilled to be there". The characterisation of Perowne as an intelligent, self-aware man: [...] "..a habitual observer of his own moods' [...] is given to reveries about his mental processes," [...] allows the author to explicitly set out this theme.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Michigan, Bump {{turned down an}} offer to play {{professional}} football for the Detroit Lions, saying {{he said he had}} obtained a job in Chicago outside of football. [...] Elliott also considered going into medicine as his father had done, but he chose instead to go into coaching. [...] He started his coaching career at Michigan in the fall of 1948 as assistant backfield coach. [...] In the spring of 1949, he was hired as an assistant coach under Kip Taylor at Oregon State, where he remained for three seasons, from 1949–1951. [...] Elliott later recalled, [...] "I was only 24 when Kip Taylor hired me as backfield coach at Oregon State, and it <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> a little because there were two backs on the squad who were older than I was." [...] It was even worse for his brother Pete, who was 22 when he was hired to coach the ends. [...] Bump recalled: [...] "After practice one night some players noticed Pete light up a cigaret. [...] One of his ends drew Pete aside and said in a fatherly voice, 'You shouldn't smoke, coach; I didn't do it when I was your age." [...] Oregon State had an overall record of 14–15 in Elliott's three years as an assistant coach.|$|E
500|$|Some {{observers}} thought Schumacher, a gay man, added possible homoerotic innuendo in the storyline. James Berardinelli {{questioned the}} [...] "random amount [...] of rubber nipples and camera angle close-ups of the Dynamic Duo's butts and Bat-crotches." [...] Similar to Batman Forever, this primarily included {{the decision to}} add nipples and enlarged codpieces to Batman and Robin suits. Schumacher stated, [...] "I {{had no idea that}} putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from ancient Greek statues, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct." [...] Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, felt [...] "it wasn't so much the nipples that <b>bothered</b> <b>me.</b> It was the codpiece. The press obviously played it up and made it a big deal, especially with Joel directing. I didn't think twice about the controversy, but going back and looking and seeing some of the pictures, it was very unusual." [...] George Clooney joked, [...] "Joel Schumacher told me we never made another Batman film because Batman was gay". Clooney himself has spoken critically of the film, saying, [...] "I think we might have killed the franchise", and called it [...] "a waste of money".|$|E

But that soon passed, and I reached a stage when mention of it would cause me to bristle. Soon that passed and it has never really <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> since, except in cases when people tried to exploit it." [...] Riegels was reminded of his mistake throughout his life. Riegels once said: [...] "All the times I've run across or heard people saying 'wrong way,' even though they weren't referring to me, I immediately turned around to see if they were speaking about me. I still don't understand how I did it." [...] Riegels dealt with his situation by laughing about what happened. Riegels once joked [...] "If I had to do it again, I'd still run in the same direction, for I surely thought I was going the right way." [...] Riegels also said [...] "You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60,000 people, and it's pretty hard to lie out of it."

500|$|Actor Mickey Rourke asked Bowie to be {{involved}} in one of the songs, the two having met in London where Rourke was based while filming the movie A Prayer for the Dying. Bowie had him perform the mid-song rap to the song [...] "Shining Star (Makin' My Love)." [...] Bowie jokingly referred to Rourke's performance as [...] "method rapping". Bowie described the song as one that [...] "reflects back-to-street situations, and how people are trying to get together in the face of so many disasters and catastrophes, socially around them, never knowing if they're going to survive it themselves. The one thing they have got to cling on to is each other; although it might resolve into something terrible, it's the only thing that they've got. It’s just a little love song coming out of that environment." [...] He rejected the notion that his [...] "high, little" [...] voice (which he attributed to Smokey Robinson) in the song was a new character (to follow behind Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke), instead saying it was just what the song needed, as he had tried the song in his regular voice and did not like the outcome: [...] "That never <b>bothered</b> <b>me,</b> changing voices to suit a song. You can fool about with it." [...] "Shining Star" [...] was one of Bowie's early choices to be a single for the album, but EMI had the final say and did not release the song as a single. A 12" [...] remix of the song was made available on iTunes when the [...] " [...] was released digitally {{for the first time in}} 2007.|$|E
500|$|... "Million Dollar Maybe" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'B' grade, {{the highest of}} the night. VanDerWerff was polarized with the plot, opining that it was convoluted and stated, [...] "This was a completely stupid plot, but to the show's credit, it commented on this when Homer told Marge he won the lottery and she said she'd much rather have the money than the wedding reception performance he missed." [...] Similarly, VanDerWerff was split with the subplot of [...] "Million Dollar Maybe". In regards to the subplot, he wrote, [...] "The Lisa gets the old people a Wii stand-in plot {{was one of those}} ones where the Simpsons writers have obviously noticed something in pop culture but have yet to wholly grasp what it is or why it's important." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode an 8.1 out of 10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. Canning felt that the episode was impressive, expressing that it was [...] "a fun and funny episode focused on Homer and his always dysfunctional relationship with his family [...] just what we've come to love and expect after 20 years." [...] Jason Hughes of [...] TV Squad gave the episode a more mixed review, praising the episode's humor, but calling it [...] "random". Hughes wrote, [...] "A lot about this episode <b>bothered</b> <b>me,</b> and I think The Simpsons has been having a pretty strong season for the most part." [...] He resumed, [...] "This one just didn't hold together as strongly as most of the prior ones." [...] He went on to criticize the character development of Ricardo, opining that it was a [...] "slap to the face to the winner." [...] He then commented: [...] "Peggy Black created Ricardo Bomba as a new ladies man type of figure, so the writers had him drive into a cliff wall and subsequent fiery explosion right away upon his first appearance. He didn't even get to finish what was, I guess, going to be his catchphrase." ...|$|E
