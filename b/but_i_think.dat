5|$|At {{first it}} always bothers you {{even though you}} say it doesn't. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{if you want to}} exceed limits, you have to suck that all in and be happy with what you have. At first it was painful to watch all those things but now I take it as {{constructive}} criticism or I don't bother to look at it.|$|E
5|$|If {{you guys}} think I'm a diva and I have {{requirements}}, Snoop is the next level. He's the hip-hop king! So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions. So we love Snoop and we wish he had been here, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. He probably would have gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E
5|$|The song comes first. And all {{of those}} other things that people remember, the imagistic things, are secondary, or {{certainly}} not as important. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I’ve become pretty good at sussing out when people's opinions of my work are coming from {{what they think of}} me personally. You just have to do your thing and then let it go out into the world. The rest, you're not in control.|$|E

It's hardly fair of you, sir, {{to make a}} ignorant man conwict {{himself in}} this way, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> DO <b>think</b> so. <b>I</b> am as respectful disposed to you, sir, as a man can be; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> DO <b>think</b> so.' ...|$|R
5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E
60|$|MRS. L. [Unmoved] Ah! I cudn't never du {{without my}} tea. There's not an avenin' <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thinks</b> to meself: Now, me dear, yu've a-got one more to fennish, an' then yu'll 'eve yore cup o' tea. Thank you for callin', all the same.|$|R

5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down the aisle}} I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn {{will be remembered as}} a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E
5|$|We love, obviously, to do provocative imagery... {{we always}} try to {{definitely}} push the limits... I think because, in the end, it's not really at all about domestic violence. It's really just about it being toxic, and they're on this drug trip and that definitely plays a part, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's also about being triumphant over those weaknesses, and she leaves him. It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad parts of it, that's what you don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her getting that out of her life. The drugs and the addiction and the toxic—that's what brings her downfall and brings a lot of harm.|$|E

25|$|I've {{always been}} fascinated with reality game shows <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it was my}} girlfriend's idea. We watch Celebrity Big Brother at the moment, we watch I'm a Celebrity, Get Me out of Here... we watch all those reality TV shows— The Office came out of those docu-soaps".|$|E
25|$|This {{country has}} been good to me. It gave me {{everything}} I have. I have never come out for any candidate before <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Wendell L. Willkie {{will give us a}} square deal. So I am for Willkie because I think he will help my people, and I figure my people should be for him, too.|$|E
25|$|I'm {{very pleased}} with what me and Tom have done together. We've {{created a lot of}} good songs, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the {{difference}} between us is probably the reason why I've started this new band. I've made a lot of my favourite songs that I've created in God Seed and I've brought with me one of these characters from that band.|$|E

25|$|For {{political}} reasons, Pakistan claims {{victory in}} the 1965 war. In my opinion, the war ended {{in a kind of}} stalemate. We were in a position of strength. Had the war continued for a few more days, we would have gained a decisive victory. I advised then prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri not to agree for ceasefire. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he was under pressure from the United Nations and some countries.|$|E
25|$|I don't. I {{support the}} Hyde Amendment. I hate abortion. I wish people didn't have abortions. I {{believe that the}} Hyde Amendment should remain the law. States should make their decision. Some states decide to do it. Most states decide not to do it. And I think that's the {{appropriate}} way to have this decided. I supported it in New York, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> in other places, people can come to a different decision.|$|E
25|$|We clam {{up and get}} tense. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the {{national}} show will improve {{in the next few}} weeks. We want to include the best segments of IMT in {{the national}} show. IMT is a lot more spontaneous than the national show – we've run up to an hour overtime. We like to get the audience to participate and if we can find someone interesting in the studio audience we throw away our scripts and just adlib.|$|E

25|$|It is {{the form}} that allows a writer the {{greatest}} opportunity to explore human experience....For that reason, reading a novel is potentially a significant act. Because {{there are so many}} varieties of human experience, so many kinds of interaction between humans, and so many ways of creating patterns in the novel that can’t be created in a short story, a play, a poem or a movie. The novel, simply, offers more opportunities for a reader to understand the world better, including the world of artistic creation. That sounds pretty grand, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it’s true.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the region is necessarily slow, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is also certain. There is every reason for expecting a steady and progressive increase in earnings for an indefinite period in the future. I am not in entire accord with the general manager's statement that the business secured from this branch may be replaced from points on our own lines. Contrary to the belief, the supplies of cedar in western Washington are comparatively limited, and the greatest reserves of this timber are {{along the line of}} the Lake Shore. I think it but {{a matter of a few}} years when the cedar will be exhausted on our other lines.|$|E
25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E
