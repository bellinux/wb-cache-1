5|$|Although {{the most}} stable isotope of fermium is 257Fm, with a {{half-life}} of 100.5days, most studies are conducted on 255Fm (t1/2= 20.07(7)hours), since this isotope can <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> isolated as required as the decay product of 255Es (t1/2= 39.8(12)days).|$|E

5|$|For {{public access}} the RNLI classifies {{stations}} {{as one of}} three types: Explore, which are normally open all year round and have a shop, Discover, normally open {{during the summer months}} and Observe which, because of their location, still welcome visitors but may not <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> accessible.|$|E
5|$|In his Commentary on Isaiah (1529), Zwingli {{noted that}} there were three kinds of governments: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. He {{expressed}} his preference for aristocracy which is not surprising given his experience with the Zürich council. In the publication, rather than comparing the three forms of government, he gave a defence of aristocracy against a monarchy. He argued that a monarchy would invariably descend to tyranny. A monarchy had inherent weaknesses in that a good ruler could <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> replaced by a bad one or a single ruler could <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> corrupted. An aristocracy with more people involved did not have these disadvantages.|$|E
50|$|H. ligatus females <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> {{distinguished}} from other females by a postero-ventral genal tooth. In addition, the males <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> {{distinguished from}} other males {{by the presence}} of long suberect hairs on the second and third metasomal sterna.|$|R
50|$|Cellulose fibres such as cotton <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> singed {{because the}} {{protruding}} fibers burn to a light ash which <b>is</b> <b>easily</b> removed. Thermoplastic fibres {{are harder to}} singe because they melt and form hard residues on the fabric surface.|$|R

5|$|One {{possible}} fix is {{to consider}} collections of objects that can <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> divided, such as pies or, still better, segmented rods. Rather than just combining collections of segments, rods can be joined end-to-end, which illustrates another conception of addition: adding not the rods but the lengths of the rods.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{of leisure}} have {{determined}} that observable patterns cannot <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> explained by socioeconomic variables such as income, occupation or education.

5|$|Thorium tetrafluoride {{is used as}} an antireflection {{material}} in multilayered optical coatings. It has an optical transparency {{in the range of}} 0.35–12µm, and its radiation is primarily due to alpha particles, which can <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> stopped by a thin cover layer of another material. Replacements for thorium tetrafluoride are being developed as of the 2010s.|$|E

The Xgrid protocol provides the basic infrastructure for computers to communicate, but is not involved in the processing of the specified calculation.

30|$|Just under {{a quarter}} (24.7 %) of our {{patients}} presented with bacteraemia, associated with higher mortality. Patients with bacteraemia could represent a suitable population to monitor prospectively in clinical practice, as bacteraemia, unlike sepsis, <b>is</b> <b>easily</b> identified retrospectively, <b>is</b> <b>easily</b> distinguished from other non-infectious diseases that cause organ dysfunction and <b>is</b> also <b>easily</b> stratified using the sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) instrument [31].|$|R
5|$|Actinium-227 {{is used as}} {{a neutron}} source. Its high {{specific}} energy (14.5 W/g) and the possibility of obtaining significant quantities of thermally stable compounds are attractive for use in long-lasting thermoelectric generators for remote use. 228Ac {{is used as a}}n indicator of radioactivity in chemical research, as it emits high-energy electrons (2.18 MeV) that can <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> detected. 228Ac-228Ra mixtures are widely used as an intense gamma-source in industry and medicine.|$|E
5|$|Babb is {{best known}} for his {{presentation}} of exploitation films, a term many in the business would embrace. According to The Hollywood Reporter, his success came from picking topics that would <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> sensationalized, such as religion and sex. His expenses were estimated at 5% for selling, and his distribution overhead near 7%, resulting in some of the largest per-dollar returns in the film industry.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{his fear}} of demagoguery and belief {{the people of the}} United States could <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> misled, Gerry also {{advocated}} indirect elections. Although he was unsuccessful in obtaining them for the lower house of Congress, Gerry did obtain such indirect elections for the U.S. Senate, whose members were to be elected by the state legislatures. Gerry also advanced numerous proposals for indirect elections of the President of the United States, most of them involving limiting the right to vote to the state governors and electors.|$|E

5|$|Blue dinitrogen {{trioxide}} (N2O3) is only {{available as a}} solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form nitric acid. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. This is {{because it is a}} hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel and can <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> stored since it is liquid at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds are {{naturally}} lipophilic and hydrophobic, {{which means the}} diamonds' surface cannot be wet by water, but can <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> wet and stuck by oil. This property can be utilized to extract diamonds using oil when making synthetic diamonds. However, when diamond surfaces are chemically modified with certain ions, {{they are expected to}} become so hydrophilic that they can stabilize multiple layers of water ice at human body temperature.|$|E
