40|$|The minimum motor {{domain of}} kinesin- 1 {{is a single}} head. Recent {{evidence}} suggests that such minimal motor domains generate force by a <b>biased</b> <b>binding</b> mechanism, in which they preferentially select binding sites on the microtubule that lie ahead in the progress direction of the motor. A specific molecular mechanism for <b>biased</b> <b>binding</b> has, however, so far been lacking. Here we use atomistic Brownian dynamics simulations combined with experimental mutagenesis to show that incoming kinesin heads undergo electrostatically guided diffusion-to-capture by microtubules, and that this produces directionally <b>biased</b> <b>binding.</b> Kinesin- 1 heads are initially rotated by the electrostatic field so that their tubulin-binding sites face inwards, and then steered towards a plus-endwards binding site. In tethered kinesin dimers, this bias is amplified. A 3 -residue sequence (RAK) in kinesin helix alpha- 6 is predicted to be important for electrostatic guidance. Real-world mutagenesis of this sequence powerfully influences kinesin-driven microtubule sliding, with one mutant producing a 5 -fold acceleration over wild type.

40|$|AbstractConventional kinesin has a double-headed {{structure}} {{consisting of}} two motor domains and moves processively along a microtubule using the two heads cooperatively. The movement of single and multiple truncated heads of Drosophila kinesin was measured using a laser trap and nanometer detecting apparatus. Single molecules of single-headed kinesin bound to the microtubules with a 3. 5 nm biased displacement toward the plus end of the microtubule. The position of these single-headed kinesin molecules bound to a microtubule did not change until they had dissociated, indicating that single kinesin heads utilize nonprocessive movement processes. Two molecules of single-headed kinesin moved continuously along a microtubule with a lower velocity and force than that of single molecules of double-headed kinesin.

We investigated the use of subcortical white matter as a reference region to quantify [18 F]FDDNP binding in the human brain. Dynamic [18 F]FDDNP PET studies were performed on 7 control subjects and 12  AD patients. Population efflux rate constants (k'_ 2) from subcortical white matter (centrum semiovale) and cerebellar cortex were derived by a simplified reference tissue modeling approach incorporating physiological constraints. Regional distribution volume ratio (DVR) estimates were derived using Logan and simplified reference tissue approaches, with either subcortical white matter or cerebellum as reference input. Discriminant analysis with cross-validation was performed to classify control subjects and AD patients. The population estimates of k'_ 2 in subcortical white matter did not differ significantly between control subjects and AD patients but the variability of individual estimates of k'_ 2 determined in white matter was lower than that in cerebellum. Logan DVR showed dependence on the efflux rate constant in white matter. The DVR estimates in the frontal, parietal, posterior cingulate, and temporal cortices were significantly higher in the AD group (p< 0. 01). Incorporating all these regional DVR estimates as predictor variables in discriminant analysis yielded accurate classification of control subjects and AD patients with high sensitivity and specificity, and the results agreed well with those using the cerebellum as the reference region.

40|$|The {{development}} of a viable sensing platform {{for the purpose of}} small molecule detection was explored on two different platforms: a Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) and an Interdigitated Electrode (IDE). A standard operating procedure (SOP) for the reliable fabrication of gold gated MOSFET platforms and IDE platforms was created via standard cleanroom techniques. The n-MOSFET platform (p-channel device) drain current (IDS) shifts due to the binding of a self assembled monolayer (SAM) onto the Au-gated FET. The IDS directly correlates to the (VG - VTH) ². Binding of an electron donating pdiethyamino phenyl isocyanide SAM onto the gate results in an positive shifted IDS /decreased VTH, while an electron withdrawing species, 1, 4 -phenyl diisocyanide SAM exhibits a negative IDS/increased VTH.

40|$|With the {{development}} of single-particle tracking (SPT) microscopy and host membrane mimics called supported lipid bilayers (SLBs), stochastic virus-membrane binding interactions can be studied in depth while maintaining control over host receptor type and concentration. However, several experimental design challenges and quantitative image analysis limitations prevent {{the widespread use of}} this approach. One main challenge of SPT studies is the low signal-to-noise ratio of SPT videos, which is sometimes inevitable due to small particle sizes, low quantum yield of fluorescent dyes, and photobleaching. These situations could render current particle tracking software to yield <b>biased</b> <b>binding</b> kinetic data caused by intermittent tracking error. Hence, we developed an effective image restoration algorithm for SPT applications called STAWASP that reveals particles with a signal-to-noise ratio of 2. 2 while preserving particle features. We tested our improvements to the SPT binding assay experiment and imaging procedures by monitoring X 31 influenza virus binding to α 2, 3 sialic acid glycolipids. Our interests lie in how slight changes to the peripheral oligosaccharide structures can affect the binding rate and residence times of viruses. We were able to detect viruses binding weakly to a glycolipid called GM 3, which was undetected via assays such as surface plasmon resonance. The binding rate was around 28 folds higher when the virus bound to a different glycolipid called GD 1 a, which has a sialic acid group extending further away from the bilayer surface than GM 3. The improved imaging allowed us to obtain binding residence time distributions that reflect an adhesion-strengthening mechanism via multivalent bonds. We empirically fitted these distributions using a time-dependent unbinding rate parameter, koff, which diverges from standard treatment of koff as a constant. We further explain how to convert these models to fit ensemble-averaged binding data obtained by assays such as surface plasmon resonance...|$|R

An attC site can be divided into two pairs of short repeats flanking a palindromic central region. The nucleotide sequence of attC among different cassettes varies extensively, implying that the site contains a structural recognition determinant with low sequence constraints. Oligonucleotides representing many different sequence modifications in either strand of the site were examined for integrase binding by using an electrophoresis mobility shift assay. The inner repeats, a central triplet and two single-nucleotide asymmetries in the site had the strongest influence on binding strength and strand choice. Our data show that the recombinase binds to a bulged hairpin in attC and that the hairpin distortion due to bulging could define the appropriate orientation of the otherwise symmetrical site. This is consistent with the strong <b>bias</b> for <b>binding</b> of recombinase to the bottom-strand oligonucleotides in vitro.

Despite the importance of studying poxvirus effects on the human immune system, reports of the direct interactions between poxviruses and primary human leukocytes (PHLs) are limited. We studied the specific molecular events that determine the VV tropism for major PHL subsets including monocytes, B cells, neutrophils, NK cells, and T cells. We found that VV exhibited an extremely strong <b>bias</b> towards <b>binding</b> and infecting monocytes among PHLs. VV binding strongly co-localized with lipid rafts {{on the surface of}} these cell types, even when lipid rafts were relocated to the cell uropods upon cell polarization. In humans, monocytic and professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) have so far only been reported to exhibit abortive infections with VV. We found that monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), including granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) -polarized M 1 and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) -polarized M 2, were permissive to VV replication. The majority of virions produced in MDMs were extracellular enveloped virions (EEV). Visualization of infected MDMs revealed the formation of VV factories, actin tails, virion-associated branching structures and cell linkages, indicating that infected MDMs are able to initiate de novo synthesis of viral DNA and promote virus release. Classical activation of MDMs by LPS plus IFN-γ stimulation caused no effect on VV replication, whereas alternative activation of MDMs by IL- 10 or LPS plus IL- 1 β treatment significantly decreased VV production. The IL- 10 -mediated suppression of VV replication was largely due to STAT 3 activation, as a STAT 3 inhibitor restored virus production to levels observed without IL- 10 stimulation. In conclusion, our data indicate that PHL subsets express and share VV protein receptors enriched in lipid rafts. We also demonstrate that primary human macrophages are permissive to VV replication. After infection, MDMs produced EEV for long-range dissemination and also form structures associated with virions which may contribute to cell-cell spread...|$|R

This study investigates the cortical abnormalities of early emotion perception in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) using gamma oscillations. Twenty-threeMDDpatients, twenty-five BDpatients, and twenty-four normal controls were enrolled and their event-related magnetoencephalographic responses were recorded during implicit emotional tasks. Our results demonstrated abnormal gamma activity within 100 ms in the emotion-related regions (amygdala, orbitofrontal (OFC) cortex, anterior insula (AI), and superior temporal pole) in theMDDpatients, suggesting that these patients may have dysfunctions or negativity <b>biases</b> in perceptual <b>binding</b> of emotional features at very early stage. Decreased left superior medial frontal cortex (smFC) responses to happy faces in the MDD patients were correlated with their serious level of depression symptoms, indicating that decreased smFC activity perhaps underlies irregular positive emotion processing in depressed patients. In the BD patients, we showed abnormal activation in visual regions (inferior/middle occipital and middle temporal cortices) which responded to emotional faces within 100 ms, supporting that the BD patients may hyperactively respond to emotional features in perceptua...|$|R
40|$|In silico {{screening}} {{has become}} a valuable tool in drug design, but some drug targets represent real challenges for docking algorithms. This {{is especially true for}} metalloproteins, whose interactions with ligands are difficult to parametrize. Our docking algorithm, EADock, is based on the CHARMM force field, which assures a physically sound scoring function and a good transferability {{to a wide range of}} systems, but also exhibits difficulties in case of some metalloproteins. Here, we consider the therapeutically important case of heme proteins featuring an iron core at the active site. Using a standard docking protocol, where the iron-ligand interaction is underestimated, we obtained a success rate of 28 % for a test set of 50 heme-containing complexes with iron-ligand contact. By introducing Morse-like metal binding potentials (MMBP), which are fitted to reproduce density functional theory calculations, we are able to increase the success rate to 62 %. The remaining failures are mainly due to specific ligand-water interactions in the X-ray structures. Testing of the MMBP on a second data set of non iron binders (14 cases) demonstrates that they do not introduce a spurious <b>bias</b> towards metal <b>binding,</b> which suggests that they may reliably be used also for cross-docking studies...|$|R

40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus of type 1 (HIV- 1) uses a programmed - 1 ribosomal frameshift to produce the precursor of its enzymes, and changes in frameshift efficiency reduce replicative fitness of the virus. We used a fluorescent two-reporter system to screen for peptides that reduce HIV- 1 frameshift in bacteria, knowing that the frameshift can be reproduced in Escherichia coli. Expression of one reporter, the green fluorescent protein (GFP), requires the HIV- 1 frameshift, whereas the second reporter, the red fluorescent protein (RFP), is used to assess normal translation. A peptide library <b>biased</b> for RNA <b>binding</b> was inserted into the sequence of the protein thioredoxin and expressed in reporter-containing bacteria, which were then screened by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We identified peptide sequences that reduce frameshift efficiency by over 50 % without altering normal translation. The identified sequences are also active against different frameshift stimulatory signals, suggesting that they bind a target important for frameshifting in general, probably the ribosome. Successful transfer of active sequences to a different scaffold in a eukaryotic test system demonstrates that the anti-frameshift activity of the peptides is neither due to scaffold-dependent conformation nor effects of the scaffold protein itself on frameshifting. The method we describe identifies peptides that will provide useful tools to further study the mechanism of frameshift and may permit the development of lead compounds of therapeutic interest...|$|R
