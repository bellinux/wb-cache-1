40|$|A {{simultaneous}} {{external and}} <b>internal</b> <b>illumination</b> method is proposed for cylindrical airlift photobioreactors in this paper, in which multiple light sources are placed around the downcomer region, {{to achieve a}} more homogeneous light distribution. Internal light sources are mounted near {{the wall of the}} draft tube and external light sources near the wall of the photobioreactor. The light distribution in an airlift photobioreactor under simultaneous external and <b>internal</b> <b>illumination</b> (APER-SEII) with various biomass concentrations and radii is investigated using the two-flux model. This model is able to obtain reasonable prediction compared with the simulation of more rigorous DO models, and is suitable for real-time control of microalgae cultivation in photobioreactors. Light attenuation profiles are compared with those of only externally illuminated airlift photobioreactors (APER-EI), showing that the new illumination method can increase the size of the illuminated zone in photobioreactors and enable a more uniform light distribution in the downcomer region. The calculation results also show that the annular distance of the downcomer region (Delta R) is more critical than the radius of the photobioreactor (R) to light distribution and therefore the design of photobioreactors. Asymmetry of light distribution in an airlift photobioreactor with the same radiation flux on the two walls is pronounced for low biomass concentrations and small radii. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{internal}} {{deuterium lamp}} {{was used to}} illuminate the SBC detector through the PR 110 L and PR 130 L prisms for 12. 2 hours each to produce a total of ~ 12, 000 counts/pixel. This illumination does not simulate the OTA optics and, therefore, is not suitable {{for the production of}} a low frequency L-flat. However, the pixel-to-pixel P-flat is an improvement over the laboratory SBC P-flat currently used in the ACS pipeline for the two dispersing modes. In addition, short exposure internal lamp flats were obtained in the standard imaging filters. These flats have sufficient signal to define the low frequency L-flat field for five filters relative to the high signal F 125 LP flat, assuming that the relative lamp illumination does not vary with wavelength. These five ratio L-flats are smoother than the ratios of the current pipeline L-flats; but there is evidence for variation of the <b>internal</b> lamp <b>illumination</b> with wavelength.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of electrical energy consumption in buildings {{is a subject}} of great interest in the international scientific community.

Light conversion efficiency is the main concern for PBR with artificial light, however due to varieties in each artificial light optical properties, it is quite difficult to have an equal comparison.

30|$|The photon {{attenuation}} {{of blood}} vessels has been observed in other techniques, such as intravital microscopy, and the absorption properties of blood are well-known [20]. The high photon absorption of the blood resulted in greater attenuation in the blood vessels than the surrounding tissue, which allowed for imaging {{of blood vessels}} and areas of blood accumulation. For example, histology confirmed red blood cell accumulation inside the tumor in Figure  7 c with a 21 % reduction of radiance at the tumor core as shown in Figure  7 d. Thus, CLI could identify necrosis within the tumor since accumulation of red blood cells {{is one of the}} characteristics of a necrotic core [30]. The reason for the lack of positive signal from the blood vessels despite the presence of 68 Ga in the blood was that the amount of radiance caused by the positron decays of 68 Ga was insignificant compared to the high attenuation of Cerenkov light in the blood as observed in Figure  3. The cumulative effect of all photons emitted from internal tissues created a whole body <b>internal</b> <b>illumination</b> that acted as a system of background lighting, which allowed for negative contrast imaging of superficial structures such as the blood vessels.|$|R
