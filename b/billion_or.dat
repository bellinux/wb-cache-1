5|$|The Sun is a G-type {{main-sequence star}} (G2V) {{based on its}} {{spectral}} class. As such, it is informally {{referred to as a}} yellow dwarf. It formed approximately 4.6 <b>billion,</b> <b>or</b> 1,000,000,000. years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimate}} in February 2007 {{placed the}} initial construction cost of One World Trade Center at about $3 <b>billion,</b> <b>or</b> $1,150 {{per square foot}} ($12,380 per square meter). However, the tower's total estimated construction cost had risen to $3.9 billion by April 2012, making it the most expensive building {{in the world at}} the time. The tower's construction was partly funded by approximately $1billion of insurance money that Silverstein received for his losses in the September 11 attacks. The State of New York provided an additional $250million, and the Port Authority agreed to give $1billion, which would be obtained through the sale of bonds. The Port Authority raised prices for bridge and tunnel tolls to raise funds, with a 56percent toll increase scheduled between 2011 and 2015; however, the proceeds of these increases were not used to pay for the tower's construction.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, {{banks were}} {{deregulated}} in Iceland. This {{set the stage}} for banks to upload debts when foreign companies were accumulated. The crisis unfolded when banks became unable to refinance their debts. It is estimated that the three major banks held foreign debt in excess of €50 <b>billion,</b> <b>or</b> about €160,000 per Icelandic resident, compared with Iceland's gross domestic product of €8.5 billion. As early as March 2008, the cost of private deposit insurance for deposits in Landsbanki and Kaupthing was already far higher (6–8½% of the sum deposited) than for other European banks. The króna, which was ranked by The Economist in early 2007 as the most overvalued currency in the world (based on the Big Mac Index), has further suffered from the effects of carry trading.|$|E
