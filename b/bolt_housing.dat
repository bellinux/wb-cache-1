2500|$|In December 1944, a modernized {{version of}} the M3 known as the M3A1 was {{introduced}} into service, with all parts except the <b>bolt,</b> <b>housing</b> assembly, and receiver interchangeable {{with those of the}} M3. The M3A1 had several improvements: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{barrel and}} rifling are {{chromium-plated}} to prevent fouling. The <b>bolt</b> <b>housing</b> has grooves to allow bolt movement, even in extremely adverse {{conditions such as}} exposure to mud, dust, or sand. The exterior surfaces of the firearm are finished with epoxy resin coating for protection against corrosion and damage.|$|E
50|$|The OG-43 {{sported a}} very modern design, {{compared}} to its contemporaries. The receiver {{was made of}} stamped sheet metal, with the magazine serving as a grip. The bulk of the L-shaped bolt, along with the recoil spring, was housed in a cylinder directly above the barrel, which helped reduce muzzle climb when firing. The reciprocating cocking handle was located in the forward section of the <b>bolt</b> <b>housing.</b> The weapon was short-recoil blowback operated, and fired from an open bolt in both automatic and semi-automatic mode. Adjustable iron sights were fitted, with two possible settings for either 100m or 200m. Initially equipped with forward-folding metal stock, later production runs were fitted with simpler, wooden fixed stocks. It used the same double-stack magazines as the Beretta MAB 38, available in 10, 20, 30 or 40 rounds.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are some}} notable {{buildings}} in Burnt Hill including the Methodist Chapel 1864 {{which is still}} in use, Burnt Hill House, Burnt Hill Cottage, Wistaria Cottage (now very much extended), Sloe Pightle (pightle a small field or enclosure presumably where sloes grew) and Nut & <b>Bolt</b> <b>House</b> formerly the Axe and Compass Public House ( [...] The Compasses Inn). The Axe and Compass {{changed its name to}} the Nut & <b>Bolt</b> Public <b>House</b> in the 1970s (reputedly after the licensees of the time; John and Val Bolton [...] ) According to the West Berkshire Campaign for Real Ale when the Boltons were asked why they changed the name they said,‘Because we are the Bolts and all our customers are nuts!’ [...] It is now called Nut & <b>Bolt</b> <b>House,</b> a private house.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bolt</b> <b>houses</b> {{the firing}} pin {{mechanism}} that visually and tactilely protrudes {{from the rear of}} the bolt indicating if the action is cocked or not. A small disassembly button offers the possibility to access {{the firing pin}} and spring.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} {{the results of}} {{manufacturing}} process analysis of hole production for aircraft industry in CFRP/metal sandwiches are presented. Hole production is provided with hand-guided tool. The review of the most widespread tool backup facilities according to manufacturing process analysis is state. Hole classification for CFRP/metal sandwiches was suggested according to the specific production step. Five types of holes produced in CFRP/ metal sandwiches was classified. They are one pass holes, multi pass holes without <b>bolt</b> head <b>housing</b> and intermediate dismantling, multi pass holes with <b>bolt</b> head <b>housing</b> and intermediate dismantling, multi pass holes without <b>bolt</b> head <b>housing</b> and without intermediate dismantling, multi pass holes with <b>bolt</b> head <b>housing</b> and without intermediate dismantling.

5000|$|Around 1990, Dillon Aero {{acquired}} {{a large number}} of miniguns and spares from [...] "a foreign user". The guns kept failing to shoot continuously, revealing that they were actually worn-out weapons. The company decided to fix the problems encountered, rather than simply putting the guns into storage. Fixing failure problems ended up improving the minigun's overall design. Dillon's efforts to improve the minigun reached the 160th SOAR, and Dillon was invited to Fort Campbell, Kentucky to demonstrate its products. A delinker-used to separate cartridges from ammunition belts and feed them into the gun housing-; and other parts were tested on Campbell's ranges. The 160th SOAR liked the delinker's performance and began ordering them by 1997. This prompted Dillon to improve other design aspects, including the <b>bolt,</b> <b>housing</b> and barrel. Between 1997 and 2001, Dillon Aero was producing 25-30 products a year. In 2001, it was working on a new bolt design that increased performance and service life. By 2002 virtually every component of the minigun had been improved, so Dillon began producing complete weapons with improved components. The guns were purchased quickly by the 160th SOAR as its standardized weapon system. The gun then went through the Army's formal procurement system approval process and in 2003 the Dillon Aero minigun was certified and designated M134D.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bolt</b> <b>houses</b> {{the firing}} pin {{mechanism}} that gets cocked when the bolt is opened and the cocking piece protrudes visually and tactilely {{from the rear of}} the bolt to indicate the action is cocked. This bolt sleeve lock was not present on previous Mauser bolt action designs and reduced firing pin travel and lock time.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was here}} he welcomed the future Protector Somerset. The {{premises}} consisted of timber-framed buildings ranged around courtyards, including a panelled hall and parlour, buttery, kitchen, cheesehouse, bakehouse, <b>bolting</b> <b>house</b> and brewhouse, {{as well as}} numerous [...] "chambers" [...] or bedrooms. A small part of this extensive home survives {{on the corner of}} Marsh Lane, complete with external carvings and mouldings. Carved panels from the interior are now at Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire.|$|R
50|$|Opposite Nut & <b>Bolt</b> <b>House</b> is the curiously named The Bungalow; curious {{because it}} is not a bungalow. Prior to ~2010 it had the far more {{interesting}} name of Compass Pightle providing a link between Axe and Compass and the use of artisan tools as names and symbols and Sloe Pightle and the now archaic use of the word pightle as a small field or clearing. Hopefully the plot will be restored to its original name in the future.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bolt</b> <b>houses</b> {{the firing}} pin {{mechanism}} that cocks when the bolt is opened, and the cocking piece protrudes visually and tactilely {{from the rear of}} the bolt to indicate the action is cocked. A cocking shroud lock that was not present on previous Mauser bolt-action designs was added. The distance {{the firing pin}} needs to travel was decreased to reduce and hence improve lock time — the amount of time between initiating the firing sequence by releasing the trigger and the firing pin striking the primer that ignites the propellant contained in the 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge.|$|R
5000|$|Fleming's Goldeneye {{became the}} social {{epicenter}} of Jamaica's north coast along with nearby Firefly owned by Noël Coward, and <b>Bolt</b> <b>House,</b> owned by Chris Blackwell's mother, Blanche, {{who was a}} long time friend of Fleming. The property was equally popular with a coterie of Hollywood stars and British literary greats as it was British aristocrats and international heads of state. Errol Flynn, Lucian Freud, Truman Capote, Patrick Leigh Fermor, the Duchess of Devonshire, Princess Margaret, and Prime Minister Anthony Eden were all visitors. Eden even made the property the temporary Headquarters for the British government during the Suez Crisis of 1956.|$|R

5000|$|Nut & <b>Bolt</b> <b>House</b> has two dated bricks in {{its front}} facade circa 1834 and 1873 {{but was a}} public house from at least 1817 when it was {{mentioned}} {{in the trial of}} one William Fuller for [...] "stealing, on the 22d of April , one gelding, price 20£.; one mare, price 20£., the property of Edward Shepherd and one coat, value 15s. , the property of Thomas Shepherd" [...] a farmer and his son at nearby Yattendon. John Hope, an acquaintance of the defendant, testified [...] "On the 21st of April, I saw him at the sign of the Compasses, at Burnt-hill, which is about a mile from Mr. Shepherd's; he left there about a quarter after six in the evening." [...] Fuller was found guilty and sentenced to death aged 22.|$|R
50|$|There are 4 {{different}} types of units. The differences between the types are the bell <b>housing</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern and valve body assemblies.|$|R
2500|$|Colleague Ron Gomez of Lafayette {{stated that}} Duke, as a {{short-term}} legislator, was [...] "so single minded, {{he never really}} {{became involved in the}} nuts and <b>bolts</b> of <b>House</b> rules and parliamentary procedure. It was just that shortcoming that led to the demise of most of his attempts at lawmaking." ...|$|R

60|$|People screamed. People sprang off the pavement: It {{passed in}} shouts, it passed by {{instinct}} down the hill. They were shouting {{in the street}} before Marvel was halfway there. They were <b>bolting</b> into <b>houses</b> and slamming the doors behind them, with the news. He heard it and made one last desperate spurt. Fear came striding by, rushed ahead of him, {{and in a moment}} had seized the town.|$|R
2500|$|The 1971 {{and older}} blocks use a [...] "small" [...] bell <b>housing</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern that is {{exclusive}} to AMC and small Nash sixes. In 1972 the bell <b>housing</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern {{was changed to}} match the AMC V8's - its final use was in 2006 when the 4.0 was phased out. Four bolts on the cylinder block are matched to the transmission bellhousing where an adapter plate serves both as a dust cover - two additional bolt holes on the transmission bellhousing used on the AMC V8 are used to secure the dust cover. The 1971 258 uses the [...] "small" [...] pattern, the only year 258 to do so.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1980, {{the block}} was {{redesigned}} with a bell housing flange and a low-mount starter {{that is very}} similar to the small-block Ford V8. This version is easily identified by its low-mounted starter location down by the oil pan rail and {{is referred to as the}} Big Bell 200. The big bell design is uncommon but sought after by I-6 performance enthusiasts because it can be modified to accept a Ford small block V8 six <b>bolt</b> bell <b>housing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The miltants came {{at night}} and {{initially}} asked the villagers {{to hand over the}} female members of the village for satisfying their sexual urges. When the villagers resisted this they were attacked. The terrorists came then <b>bolted</b> the <b>house</b> of Abdullah Remo and Bashir Abdullah. Then they lobbed a grenade inside before setting the house on fire. Of the fifteen charred bodies which were recovered seven were of children the youngest one being only four years old.|$|R
5000|$|The bell <b>housing</b> <b>bolt</b> {{pattern for}} the old AMC 196 Straight-6 engine {{is the same as}} for the more modern early 199 and 232 (used from 1964 to 1971), but the 196 had {{different}} dowel pin sizes. AMC's 1956 to 1966 V8s used a different bell <b>housing</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern that was slightly larger in diameter than the six cylinder bell. When AMC discontinued their first V8 engine design after 1966, the bell housing changed; all 1966-up V8 bell <b>housing</b> <b>bolt</b> patterns are the same. The bell housing for six-cylinder engines changed to match the V8 in 1972 when AMC switched from Borg-Warner to Chrysler transmissions automatic. The flywheel also changed from 153 teeth (a common Chevy size) to 164 teeth (a common Ford size). Starter motors used with the 1966-up V8 bellhousing were sourced from Motorcraft which interchanges with the Ford V8 and some of their inline sixes (which uses a separate starter solenoid) - the Jeep 4.0 L uses a Mitsubishi-designed starter which has an integrated solenoid which is lighter in weight but retaining the two mounting bolts with a threaded top hole and unthreaded hole which bolts to the transmission bellhousing.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the sport}} of biathlon, because semiautomatic guns are illegal for race use, straight-pull actions are quite common, and are used almost {{exclusively}} on the world cup along with the Lateral Toggle action. The first company to make the straight pull action for [...]22 caliber was J. G. Anschütz; the action is specifically the straight pull ball bearing lock action, which features spring-loaded ball bearings {{on the side of}} the bolt which lock into a groove inside the <b>bolt's</b> <b>housing.</b> With the new design came a new dry-fire method; instead of the bolt being turned up slightly, the action is locked back to catch the firing pin. The two companies who have made the lateral toggle are Finn biathlon, as well as Izhmash. Finn was the first to make this type of action, however, due to the large swing of the arm as well as the stiffness of the bolt, these rifles fell out of favour and have been discontinued. Izhmash improved on the lateral swing with their Biathlon 7-3 and 7-4 series rifles, which have some use on world cups, but are largely thought of as inaccurate as well as having the inconvenience of having to remove the shooter's hand from the grip.|$|R
40|$|Spring clips seal {{housings}} {{for electronic}} circuitry, preventing electromagnetic interference from entering or leaving housings. Clips also keep dust out of <b>housing.</b> Since no <b>bolts</b> are used, <b>housing</b> can be opened quickly; unlike bolts, clips {{can be used}} on thin-walled housing. Seal was developed for an X-band array amplifier...|$|R
50|$|The Goncz {{action is}} an {{original}} design {{and does not}} copy other actions. This design utilizes a blowback-operated telescopic <b>bolt</b> system <b>housed</b> in the upper receiver tube. The bolt travels on a firing rod which protrudes through the bolt, left of center, next to the firing pin, and a guide rod located {{at the top of}} the bolt. Both rods and their corresponding springs are attached to the spring holder base plate. A recoil buffer sits on the base plate to prevent damage to the bolt when cycling.|$|R

The music video was directed by Chris Rogers. It premiered on CMT on June 16, 1999.|$|R
50|$|The Iron Duke I4 used by AMC in Jeeps from 1980 to 1983 {{used the}} {{standard}} small block Chevrolet <b>bolt</b> pattern bell <b>housing.</b> The later (1984-02) AMC I4 had the GM 60 degree V6/I4 bolt pattern, {{and this was}} retained {{for the life of}} the engine. AMC often used lighter duty transmissions with the four cylinder engines.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} {{variations}} of the EJ25D sold in the US market. The engine was introduced in 1996 in the Legacy 2.5GT, LSi, and Legacy Outback. That version of the engine used HLA heads, was recommended to be run on 91 octane fuel, had lower power and torque ratings than the later '97-99 EJ25D, and was only offered with an automatic transmission. In 1997 a revised engine was introduced that used heads with shimmed bucket lifters (versus the HLAs), was designed to run on 87 octane fuel, and was available with either a manual or automatic transmission. Because of the DOHC valve architecture, the spark plugs {{are more difficult to}} service in comparison to SOHC variations. The DOHC engines are therefore installed with platinum spark plugs and an extended spark plug service life of 80000 mi. The EJ25D uses smaller 48mm rod journals, compared to the 2.2L of the same year, and the 1999+ 2.5L engines which use a 52mm rod journal. As well, the EJ25D from the 1999 Outback is a one year only factory hybrid, which uses the phase 2 case halves with an 8 <b>bolt</b> bell <b>housing</b> (as opposed to the 4 <b>bolt</b> bell <b>housing</b> used until 1998), uses a phase 2 crankshaft and rods with 52mm rod journals, but retains the same pistons as the 1997-1998 variant to maintain the same compression ratio. The 1996 EJ25D uses different pistons than what was used for 1997-1999, which will increase the compression ratio significantly if combined with 1997-1999 EJ25D heads.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, GM {{introduced}} a redesigned 4L60E transmission case that incorporated a bolt-on bell (2 piece case, bell and case) housing and an 6 <b>bolt</b> tail <b>housing.</b> This 2 piece case style was first seen in 1996 and up model S-10 Blazer, S-10 Truck, GMC Jimmy, and GMC Sonoma with the 4.3L engine. In {{the large majority}} of 1998 & later applications of the 4L60E were 2 piece cases (i.e., a removable bell housing). Both transmissions are the same internally. The non-PWM (1993-1994) style 4L60Es are not interchangeable with PWM-style (1995 and later) 4L60Es. Also in 1996, GM changed the 3-2 solenoid to a different style which makes it not interchangeable with any previous models.|$|R
40|$|This is {{a thesis}} {{presents}} a differential gear which {{is found in}} a tracked vehicle called BvS 10. The tracked vehicle is manufactured by BAE Systems Hägglunds AB in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. The differential gear has a <b>bolted</b> <b>house.</b> The differential meets the requirement specifications, {{but the problem is}} that the bolts are sheared off because of the extreme torque that the differential is exposed to resist. Previous report on the differential show pictures of bolts which have been sheared off at the threads. This report is also includes three lists that explain seven different proposals which some are approved and some are not, and the report also presents the force, tensile, and shear stress. In a bolted connection there is both axial tension stress and radial shear stress, which can lead to wear out and broken bolts. To solve the problem, better bolts are need for the differential gear <b>housing</b> halves. The <b>bolts</b> are from M 8 to M 10 and all bolts are not directly compatible, so geometric modifications might have to be done. This reports proposes several solutions to this complex problem and also analyzes the proposed solutions. The report also describes various theories from a technical and a historical point of view. Two flow charts have been created to show the work towards the presented solution. Although the analysis to welded joints and wedge joints have been included in the proposed solution. The report propose a tight-fit bolt with a tolerance specially made for the differential gear, so the shear stress occurs at the non-threaded part of the bolt. The tight-fitted bolt is recommended to be M 8 12. 9 UNB because of it’s safety factor. Larger bolts may not directly fit in the differential housing halves due to there is no enough material...|$|R

50|$|For {{the model}} year 1996 GM trucks, there were 2 {{versions}} of the 4L60E transmissions. One had a <b>bolt</b> on bell <b>housing</b> the other did not. The bolt on bellhousings used on the 4.3L and 1996-2002 GEN I+ {{versions of the}} Small Block Chevrolet used the same bellhousing while the LSx engines used a longer bellhousing to accommodate a redesigned torque converter with a longer pilot nose (GM sells an adapter assembly for using the LSx 4L60-Es when used with an early engine).|$|R

There is a version for the cast-iron 4-cylinder engines of the 940 (redblock), the all aluminum 6-cylinder of the 960 (whiteblock), and the version for the Volkswagen 6-cylinder diesel engine D24TIC. The differences are the bell <b>housing</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern and the output shaft flange with a 3-bolt flange for the redblock/diesel engines and a 4 bolt flange for whiteblock engines.The variant for the 6-cylinder Volvo engine will fit on all 4/5/6 all-aluminum Volvo N/RN-series engines.|$|R
