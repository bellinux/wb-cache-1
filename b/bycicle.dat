40|$|In sports where {{high speed}} is involved, races are often won by milliseconds. Any {{advantage}} {{can then be}} important {{in order to reach}} the success. The drag acting on the athletes is often the highest force that the athletes have to fight against and, even a small reduction of drag, can create an advantage in terms of performances. However, in sports like ski jumping, the aerodynamic involved gets to be more complex, involving drag and lift force. Wind tunnel measurements have been carried out in the last century {{in order to understand the}} physics behind phenomena linked to sport activities (for example ball aerodynamics) or in order to optimize postures and materials. With the performances enhancement as final goal the aerodynamics behind a number of sports have been previously studied. Posture optimization, low drag <b>bycicles,</b> skin suits or even the recent and famous Speedo swimming suits are only some of the achievements of the research carried out. In the present thesis, a wide approach to the topic with particular focus on textile aerodynamics has been used. The thesis has then be divided into two main areas: A research Area 1 named Textiles and their effect on the aerodynamics of athletes and referred RA 1 where the influence of textiles and clothing equipement on the drag acting against the athletes have been studied and a Research Area 2 named Performances and Prototyping where more practical examples of how aerodynamics can directy affect athletes performances are given and exposed. In RA 1 the topography of textiles have been studied and the surface structure properties has been linked to the aerodynamic properties with particular regards to drag reduction and turbulence tripping. In order to simplify the case the athlete’s body has been simplified as a serie of cylindrical shapes and tests have been carried out mostly on cylinders. Effect of yaw angle, different speed, different diameter, different roughness, different material and distance between body parts have been analyzed. At the same time, test on existing suits have been carried out and a mathematical model in order to estimate performances in speed skating has been made. In RA 2 different side projects have been carried out and the results can be summarized as follow: Effects of body weight in ski jumping has been analyzed in order to figure out if the new rules imposed by the FIS (International Ski Federation) were effective in order to reduce the increasing problem of anorexia amongst ski jumpers. Wind tunnel measurements were carried out in order to find the aerodynamic forces acting on a ski jumper in his flight path. The experimental data were then implemented into a mathematical model which is able to simulate the in-run and the flight path. In cycling, the attention was focused on the posture assumed by the cyclists with the goal of reducing the drag while keeping a good biomechanical efficiency. The rules imposed by UCI (International Cycling Union) set the boundaries. However, a impressively good result has been obtained focusing the attention on each athlete and finding a subjective optimum posture for each of the athletes tested. A low drag ski boot have been designed with a airfoiled shape which permitted to obtain an impressive drag reduction on the total drag acting on a downhill skier. Speed skating suits have been tested in order to quantify the influence of different model suits on skating performances. The suit used by torwegian Olympic team of ski-cross has been designed using the knowledge acquired and presented in RA 1. An impressive drag reduction has been obtained and it helped two norwegian athletes to win a silver and a bronze medal at theWinter Olympic Games in Vancouver 2010. As previously mentioned, the research areas are: Research Area 1 - Textiles and their effect on the aerodynamics of athletes Research Area 2 - Performances and prototyping The main contributions are: P 1 : Reducing the Athlete’s aerodynamics P 2 : Experimental analysis on parameters affecting drag force on athletes P 3 : Aerodynamic and comfort properties of single jersey textiles for high speed sports P 4 : Aerodynamic behavior of single sport jersey fabrics with different roughness and cover factors P 5 : Effect of different skin suits on speed skating performances P 6 : Aerodynamic optimization and energy saving of cycling postures for international elite level cyclists P 7 : Effects of body weight on Ski Jumping performances under the new FIS rules P 8 : Airfolied design for alpine skiers boots P 9 : Aerodynamic and Comfort Characteristics of A Double Layer Knitted Fabric Assembly for High Speed Winter Sports P 10 : A Low Drag Suit For Ski-Cross Competition...|$|R

There are several studies that show that the Whole Body Vibration (WBV) can be a reliable alternative to many other types of training {{to reduce the risk}} of falls of the elderly, by improving the muscle strength, balance capacity and mobility (Lam, Lau, Chung & Pang, 2012). Thus, the present study aims to find out what are the effects of the vibration training on muscle strength and dynamic balance in individuals over 65 years old. Methods: Thirty-one older people (age 70, 2 ± 6, 3 years) were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n= 16), performing 16 weeks, 2 weekly sessions of 30 min of exercise with warm up (5 min <b>bycicle</b> and 5 min 4 set of exercises) 30 sec x 4 sets of WBV with 60 sec of rest between sets; or to a control group (n= 15).

40|$|Background: Chronic pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} disease symptoms and represents a global health problem with a considerable economic burding, affecting an estimated 20 % to 30 % of adults worldwide. The affectiveness of pharmacological treatments for chronic pain is often limited, and there is growing concern about the adverse effets of these treatment, including opioid dependance. Non pharmacological approach to chronic pain may be an attractive alternative or adjunctive treatment. With this study, we describe the effectiveness of a multi-combined nutraceutical treatment on chronic pain syndrome as chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia like symptomes. Objective: To assess the analgesic effect of a multi-nutraceutical supplement of palmitoylethanolamide, ß - caryophyillene, carnosic acid and Commiphora Myrrha in terms of clinical outcome with improvement of evaluation scales, reduction of nitric oxyde levels, oxidative stress parameters (AOPP) and increase of the production of endogenous antioxidants (protein thiol groups and FRAP). Selection Criteria: Randomised, double blind, active or alternative dietary supplement controlled trials investigating the use of the multiple dietary supplement (for at least six weeks' duration), for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain or myalgia, with at least 10 participants per treatment group. Participants were adults aged 35 and over, Methods: Twenty patients with diagnosis of chronic neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia-like symptomes were first of all characterized by sex, age, lifestyle, comorbilities and concomitants therapies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{represent}} and analyse all mandibular fractures that occurred in a 13 -year period in the University Hospital Aachen which means to evaluate the epidemiological facts – e. g. cause of injury, distribution of age and gender, complications – as well as the therapy of mandibular fractures. On the one hand the results are compared to a survey from 1993 which agrees on several points with this study. In this way changes in etiology and therapy within the same clinic over a 27 -year period can be demonstrated. On the other hand the importance of the socio-demographic aspect will be emphazised by comparing the results to related national and international studies. Altogether 399 patients have been implicated in this review. Data were collected regarding name, age, gender, date of birth, date of surgery, cause of injury, radiographs, site of fracture, number of fractures, pre-therapeutic diagnosis, intra-therapeutic diagnosis, treatment, addictions, concomitant injuries, medication, pre-existing affections and complications. Furthermore a questionnaire regarding complications and evaluation of the hospital residence was developed on the basis of which the 20 - 29 year age group was interviewed. The highest occurrence in trauma was in the 20 - 29 year age group, males sustained injury more frequently than females, the male:female ratio was 3, 3 : 1. As referred in most assimilable studies assault is the major cause of mandibular fractures in Aachen and the surrounding area (40 %) followed by road traffic accidents (25, 7 %) and falls (20, 8 %). The percentage of fractures caused by <b>bycicle</b> accidents was higher than reported in most other studies. Results show an involvement of alcohol and drug use with interpersonal violence. Besides a correlation between alcohol intoxication/nicotine consumption and complications after treatment had been acknowledged. The average number of fractures per patient is 1. 6. Fractures of the parasymphyseal region were most common followed by fractures of the mandibular angle. Using two special radiographs in combination the accordance of pre-therapeutic and intra-therapeutic diagnosis was about 89. 9 %. Most patients were treated with miniaturized plates and screws (95. 9 %) – which is an considerable increase compared to 1993 – often in combination with intermaxillary fixation. Almost invariably all patients received antibiotics.

40|$|Background: Int Panis et al. (2009) {{concluded}} that cyclists {{are much more}} exposed to air pollution compared to car passengers, due to higher ventilation. The VE for cyclists {{was found to be}} 4. 3 times higher than for car passengers. We dig further into this high ratio, wondering if the high exposure is due to the speed at which the cyclists were cycling. We define the optimal speed as the cycling speed that minimizes inhalation of pollution and we ask ourselves the question if there is a more “optimal” speed at which those cyclists could have cycled during the field trips to reduce their exposure. Further we investigate the optimal speeds and differences in exposure between well trained and poorly trained cyclists. Methods: Maximal Exercise Test data are used to convert power into cycling speed. We check the result with real life cycling (heart rate and speed) during field trips. We group persons according to their VO 2 max, which is used as a measure for condition to check if differences depend on the physical condition of the test persons. Results / Conclusion: There is an optimal cycling power range that minimizes exposure. This optimal cycling power is associated with a minute ventilation below the first ventilatory point. When we convert power into cycling speed we get an optimal average interval of 18. 6 - 21. 8 km/h for men and 15. 3 - 19. 2 km/h for women. Note that this conversion is depending on cyclist, <b>bycicle,</b> road and weather conditions. Cycling with a speed above the optimal speed increases the exposure to air pollution. When comparing the optimal cycling speed with the speed cycled during the field trips, we conclude that cyclists in the field study tend to cycle at a speed that is slightly too high to optimize their exposure. Cyclists in Mol could have cycled 2. 5 km/h slower, resulting in 10. 7 % less pollution exposure, and 13. 96 L/km less air intake. Unfortunately this small reduction in air intake will not offset the large difference between cyclists and car passengers (a factor of 4. 3). We also look at the ventilation needs per kilometre at different cycling intensities. We conclude that {{it is important not to}} train in highly polluted areas. Finally, we don’t see any differences in L/km between well trained and less trained bikers around the “optimal interval” of relatively low speed. We do see that well trained cyclists can cycle at a higher speed without increasing their exposure per km distance. The interval of optimal speed tends to get wider when condition increases...|$|E
40|$|The Metropolitan Transport Plan of MTB (Metropoli Terra di Bari) is {{one example}} of the first {{practice}} of large scale plan in Puglia Region. On September 2009, MTB’s Board of Municipalities approved the Metropolitan Transportation Plan for 2015 (PUM MTB), a full plan with text, maps, and figures describing the road, transit and other transportation-related investments planned for the Metropoli Terra di Bari through 2015. According to the Stategic Guidelines of the Puglia Region (2007), the PUM is part of the more complex Strategic Plan process. In fact the PUM and the Strategic Plan (BA 2015) are two complementary tools for the transport-land use transformation. The policies provide broad guidance for MTB and agency partners. The Strategies are actions to implement the policies. Some actions can start tomorrow, while others will require years of effort and incremental steps. The purpose of the PUM is to develop an integrated transportation system that advances the guiding principles adopted: – Design a transportation system to support good growth patterns, including increased housing and transportation options; – Minimize direct and indirect transportation impacts on the environment for cleaner air and natural resource protection; – A transportation system that delivers cost-effective results that are feasible to construct and maintain; – Efficiently connect people to jobs and get goods to market; – Improve opportunities for businesses and citizens to easily access goods, jobs, services and housing; – Support the strategic plan vision for the Metropolitan area; The Metropolitan Transport Plan defines a system of interventions that can be articulated in: “network intervenctions” that regard the complexity of the metropolitan area and “singol intervenction” that are phically located into the 31 Municipality that form the Metropoli Terra di Bari. In particolar the intervection cathegories that the PUM defines are: – Prioritize transit investments that result in an effective transit system in order to improve the public transport use; – Renew and improve the road network with preservation of the existing road and highway system; – Intervection for the improve the touristic accessibility of the coast and the main touristic attractions; – Actions for the reduction of trasport impacts on the environment, including the construction of a Metropolitain <b>bycicle</b> network. Developing an effective regional transportation system requires understanding the needs of the region’s residents and the travel choices they will want and need to make. MTB developed this plan with a robust public involvement process including the 31 Municipality transport offices, 7 public transport agencies and many community workshops, where participants had the opportunity to work in diverse table groups in mapping activities to identify their priority investments...|$|E
40|$|É relatado o caso de um paciente de 17 anos, sofrendo desde a idade de 4 anos de enfermidade caracterizada por rigidez progressiva dos membros inferiores, descontração muscular lenta, mioquimias nas coxas, nádegas e panturrilhas, além de espasmos musculares intermitentes, sobretudo após esforço físico, dolorosos nos membros inferiores, acompanhados de sudorese profusa. A avaliação bioquímica e a biópsia muscular foram normais. A eletromiografia revelava atividade contínua de fibra muscular que persistia mesmo após a tentativa de relaxamento muscular. Não havia miotonia espontânea, provocada nem eletro-miograficamente. Paciente reagiu muito bem ao uso de carbamazepina. Fato curioso é a constatação de que a flexão {{cervical}} provoca abolição das mioquimias dos quadriceps, enquanto a extensão tem efeito oposto. Os autores acreditam tratar-se de processo semelhante ao descrito inicialmente por Isaacs, em 1961, sob o nome de "síndrome da atividade contínua das fibras musculares". É feita extensa revisão da literatura pertinente. The {{case of a}} 17 -year-old boy who {{had been}} well {{until the age of}} four when progressive stiffness of lower limbs developed is reported. Soon walking became dificult and on his thighs, buttocks and calves one could notice the appearance of myokymia. Painful and intermittent spasms were often present speccially after physical strain. This was followed by profuse sweating. Strenght was normal but muscle relaxing was slow mainly in the quadriceps. The familiar history for neuromuscular pathology was negative. Muscle enzymes, thyroid function tests were within normal limits and muscular biopsy showed no abnormalities. The EMG disclosed a permanent spontaneous activity, more evident in the quadriceps, which was normal in shape, amplitude and duration. In association to this activity multiplets discharges and low motor units were also observed; an interferencial pattern appeared at maximum contraction but the multiplets and low motor units potentials kept on showing even though voluntary muscular activity had ceased. The therapeutic essay with carbamazepin had a dramatic effect upon the course of the patient's conditions. He showed a great improvement with this drug and today leads a normal life being able even to play soccer and ride a <b>bycicle.</b> An interesting remark which should be done {{is the fact that the}} flexion of the neck inhitibs the quadriceps myokymia whereas the extension makes them to appear and even worsen. Unfortunately is was not possible to carry out a more accurate investigation concerning electropharmacology and hystopathology as the patient was uncooperative and refused to undergo such examinations. However the authors believe that this clinical picture can be considered as a case of "continous muscle-fibre activity" due to the great similarity it bears to the cases related by Isaacs in 1961.
