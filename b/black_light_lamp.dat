A NEC <b>black</b> <b>light</b> <b>lamp</b> (T 10 20 W) is placed at {{the centre of the}} reactor as an artificial light source to provide near UV irradiation with a maximum intensity at 350 nm. Hydraulic retention time (HRT) was used up to 60 minutes in this study. The effluents, after adding titanium dioxide as sensitizer, were exposed to the illumination of near UV light for various irradiation time and incident light intensities. Number of bacteria and coliforms were significantly declined from 35, 000 / 100 ml to 59 / 100 ml after 60 minutes treatment, with existing of titanium dioxide, light irradiation and aeration.

40|$|A {{simple method}} to {{estimate}} the photocatalytic reactivity performance of spray-on titanium dioxide coatings for transmissive glass surfaces was developed. This novel technique provides a standardized method to evaluate the efficiency of photocatalytic material systems over a variety of illumination levels. To date, photocatalysis assessments have generally been conducted using mercury <b>black</b> <b>light</b> <b>lamps.</b> Illumination levels for these types of lamps are difficult to vary, consequently limiting their use for assessing material performance under a diverse range of simulated environmental conditions. This new technique uses an ultraviolet (UV) gallium nitride (GaN) light emitting diode (LED) array instead of a traditional <b>black</b> <b>light</b> to initiate and sustain photocatalytic breakdown. This method was tested with a UV-resistant dye (crystal violet) applied to a titanium dioxide coated glass slide. Experimental control is accomplished by applying crystal violet to both titanium dioxide coated slides and uncoated control slides. A slide is illuminated by the UV LED array, at various light levels representative of outdoor and indoor conditions, from the dye side of the slide. To monitor degradation of the dye over time, a temperature-stabilized white light LED, whose emission spectrum overlaps with the dye absorption spectrum, is used to illuminate {{the opposite side of}} the slide. Using a spectrometer, the amount of light from the white light LED transmitted through the slide as the dye degrades is monitored as a function of wavelength and time and is subsequently analyzed. In this way, the rate of degradation for photocatalytically coated versus uncoated slide surfaces can be compared. Results demonstrate that the dye absorption decreased much more rapidly on the photocatalytically coated slides than on the control uncoated slides, and that dye degradation is dependent on illumination level. For photocatalytic activity assessment purposes, this experimental configuration and methodology minimizes many external variable effects and enables small changes in absorption to be measured. This research also compares the advantages of this innovative LED light source design over traditional mercury <b>black</b> <b>light</b> systems and non- LED lamp approaches. This novel technology begins to address the growing need for a standard method that can assess the performance of photocatalytic materials before deployment for large scale, real world use...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), {{originated}} from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria has broadly applicability for cellular and molecular biology research.

Moreover, this approach implementation during a practical class allows the exploring of fluorescence features. OBJETIVES: {{the purpose of}} this investigation was to teach the concepts and principles of protein purification during a practical class using recombinant GFP protein. MATERIAL E METHODS: Transformed E. coli JM 110 expressing GFP were resuspended in buffer solution (Tris-HCl 20 mM pH 8. 0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 20 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4) following the sonication step. The lysate was submitted to the purification through hydrophobic interaction chromatography column (HIC). After analysis of chromatogram, some collected fractions were quantified by Bradford assay and evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Besides that, the GFP presences were measured at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm on a spectrofluorimeter. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Before the experiments, the students were encouraged to explore the biochemistry characteristics of GFP, assessing protein data banks and published articles. These guided questions conducted to discussion of the purification strategy choosen. The GFP purification enabled the visual observation of chromatography principles necessary for the theory assimilation. During the chromatography running, we used a UV-A lamp which allowed a greatly exploration of concepts beyond this technique such as the sample injection, the GFP column retention, and the elution step. The chromatogram obtaneid were analysed and correlated to the collected fractions. Our next step was the efficiency analysis generated by the GFP measurement, total protein quantification and the analytical method SDS-PAGE.

40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) exist widely {{in both the}} indoor and outdoor environment. The main contributing sources of VOCs are motor vehicle exhaust and solvent utilization. Some VOCs are toxic and carcinogenic to human health, such as benzene. In this study, TiO 2 –SiO 2 based photocatalysts were synthesized using the sol–gel method, with high surface areas of 274. 1 – 421. 1 m 2 /g obtained. Two types of pellets were used as catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor installed with a UV <b>black</b> <b>light</b> <b>lamp.</b> Experiments were conducted to compare their efficiencies in degrading the VOCs. Toluene {{was used as the}} VOC indicator. When the toluene laden gas stream passed through the photocatalytic reactor, the removal efficiencies were determined using a FTIR multi-gas analyser, which was connected to the outlet of the reactor to analyse the toluene concentrations. As the TiO 2 –SiO 2 pellets used have a high adsorption capacity, they had dual functions as a photocatalyst and adsorbent in the hybrid photocatalysis and adsorption system. The experiments demonstrated that the porous photocatalyst with very high adsorptive capacity enhanced the subsequent photocatalysis reactions and lead to a positive synergistic effect. The catalyst can be self-regenerated by photocatalytic oxidation of the adsorbed VOCs. When the UV irradiation and feeding gas is continuous, a destruction efficiency of about 25 % was achieved over a period of 20 h. Once the system was designed and operated into adsorption/regeneration mode, a higher removal efficiency of about 55 % was maintained. It was found that the catalyst pellets with a higher surface area (421 m 2 /g) achieved higher conversion efficiency (100 %) for a longer period than those with a lower surface area. A full spectrum scan was carried out using a Bio-rad Infrared spectrometer, finding that the main components of the treated gas stream leaving the reactor, along with untreated toluene, were CO 2 and water.

A non-film titania media as pellets were placed on the three fixed beds within the reactor. Toluene and acetone were used as indicators of VOCs during the experiment.

It was found that the lower the acetone concentration of the untreated inlet gas, the higher the oxidation efficiency. The oxidation efficiency was in the range of 40 – 70 % for various concentrations of untreated gases. Two concentrations of toluene laden gas stream were also tested using the same reactor. The oxidation efficiencies were found as 50 % for 120 ppm toluene gas and 45 % for 300 ppm toluene gas. It was found that the times required for toluene to reach oxidization equilibrium have been halved than for acetone gas stream. Other parameters such as flow rate and UV intensity were also altered to see their effects on the oxidation efficiency. A full spectrum scan was carried out using a Bio-rad Infrared spectrometer. It was found that the main components of the treated gas stream from the outlet of the reactor were CO 2 and water along with small amount of untreated acetone.

The oxidation rate was higher in the reactor irradiated by UV-C than by UV-A (38. 4 vs. 31. 9 nM s- 1) at the same photon flux, with similar trends for mineralization (53. 9 vs. 43. 4 %) and reaction quantum efficiency (i. e., photonic efficiency, 63. 3 vs. 50. 1 nmol C 02 ~mol photons- 1). UV-C irradiation also led to decreased intermediate concentration in the effluent compared to UV -A irradiation. These results demonstrated that STC-catalyzed oxidation is enhanced by both increased photon flux and photon energy. The effect of temperature and relative humidity on the STC-catalyzed degradation of ethanol was also determined using the UV-A light source at its maximum intensity...|$|R

This compounds are pesticides or biocides, hygienic and personal care products, surfactants, antiseptics, flame retardants, disinfection subproducts, gasoline additives and even drugs. These compounds are known as emerging pollutants. Emerging pollutants tend to present a high molecular weight, an elevated persistence and a high toxicity, in addition they are not regulated by law. Moreover, in most cases, it is not known the risk they exert on the human health and on the environment. Furthermore, in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which work through biological treatments, {{it is not possible to}} remove them completely due to their high stability. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) are techniques developed in the last decades able to remove or increase the biodegradability of such compounds so that the effectiveness of biological treatments is augmented. These techniques are based on the formation of radicals with elevated oxidation power, such as hydroxyl radicals (HO•), capable of removing and mineralizing the pollutant molecules. In this work, the degradation and the mineralization of the pharmaceutical compound Tiapride, a neuroleptic used to treat mental illness, has been studied through Photolysis, Fenton and Photo-Fenton techniques in reactors with BLB (<b>Black</b> <b>Light</b> Blue) <b>lamps</b> and Heterogeneous Photocatalysis in a Solarbox reactor. Moreover, it has also been studied the interaction of the compound with Fe 2 + ions and hydrogen peroxide in absence and presence of UV light, and with titanium oxide (IV) in absence of radiation. Photo-Fenton has been the Advanced Oxidation Process that achieved the best results. A 98. 7 % of degradation and a 44. 4 % of mineralization was obtained using concentrations of 100 ppm of H 2 O 2, 10 ppm of Fe 2 + and 50 ppm of Tiapridr...|$|R
