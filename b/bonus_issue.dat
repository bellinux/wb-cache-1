5|$|The Collegian {{has been}} the school student {{newspaper}} of record at Baltimore City College since it was first published as a bi-weekly newspaper in 1929. There have been other similar publications, such as The Oriole, the student magazine which started printing in 1912, however The Collegian is oldest, continuous student-run publication. Originally, the newspaper was both managed and printed by students. During the 1930s, The Collegian won numerous awards including {{second place in the}} Columbia Scholastic Press Association's annual contest for five years in a row. Since 2000, printing of the publication has been scaled back. The Collegian is now published quarterly, often with a <b>bonus</b> <b>issue</b> {{around the time of the}} annual City-Poly football game. Since 2014, The Collegian also actively engages students and alumni through various social media platforms.|$|E
25|$|The Steelers Digest is {{the only}} {{official}} newspaper for the Pittsburgh Steelers. It has been published for 22 years and is currently published by Dolphin/Curtis Publishing in Miami, Florida, which also handles several other publications. The newspaper is very widely acknowledged by Steelers fans. Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular season game and continues through playoffs {{as long as the}} Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a <b>bonus</b> <b>issue</b> is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft recap, and training camp edition every other month, then leading into the pre-season. There are typically 24 issues of the paper within a publishing year. The newspaper is listed on the official Steelers.com page.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>bonus</b> <b>issue</b> {{is usually}} {{based upon the}} number of shares that {{shareholders}} already own. [...] (For example, the <b>bonus</b> <b>issue</b> may be [...] "n shares for each x shares held"; but with fractions of a share not permitted.) While the {{issue of bonus shares}} increases the total number of shares issued and owned, it does not change the value of the company. Although the total number of issued shares increases, the ratio of number of shares held by each shareholder remains constant. In this sense, a <b>bonus</b> <b>issue</b> is similar to a stock split.|$|E

40|$|Event study {{analysis}} {{is applied to}} investigate stock price reaction to the announcement of <b>bonus</b> <b>issues</b> for the emerging stock markets of China. Results show that the issues with a high bonus ratio (number of bonus shares in the issue/number of existing shares) usually attract positive returns and the issues with a low bonus ratio are rewarded with negative returns. The A-shares and B-shares prices exhibit some similarities in their reactions to <b>bonus</b> <b>issues</b> approvals. The hypothesis of semi-strong form market efficiency is rejected only partly for Chinas stock markets...|$|R
50|$|Because a <b>bonus</b> <b>issue</b> {{does not}} {{represent}} an economic event - no wealth changes hands. The current shareholders simply receive new shares, for free, and in proportion to their previous share in the company. Therefore, a bonus share issue {{is very similar to}} a stock split. The only practical difference is that a <b>bonus</b> <b>issue</b> creates a change {{in the structure of the}} company's shareholders' equity (in accounting). Another difference between a <b>bonus</b> <b>issue</b> and a stock split is that while a stock split usually also splits the company's authorized share capital, the distribution of bonus shares only changes its issued share capital (or even only its outstanding shares).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} market {{valuation}} {{of an unusual}} form of free stock distributions called <b>bonus</b> <b>issues</b> which are mainly financed by the revaluations of assets equity reserve in an inflationary economic setting. We detect positive excess return on the announcement day for these <b>bonus</b> <b>issues</b> similar to the market reaction to stock dividends and splits in developed and emerging markets. In an institutional environment where cash dividend substitution effect, agency cost effect, transaction cost effect and retained earnings effect are not present, we find empirical support for the enhanced liquidity hypothesis, but interestingly, no support for the attention getting hypothesis and the signaling hypothesis which is the predominant explanation for the positive market reaction to the stock distributions in developed capital markets. We also provide a unique explanation for <b>bonus</b> <b>issues</b> as corporations need to increase their eroding paid-in capital in an inflationary environment {{in order to have}} a better debt to paid-in capital ratio for more credibility and borrowing capacity in a market of limited access to external equity financing.

40|$|Abstract: Event study {{analysis}} {{is applied to}} investigate stock price reaction to the announcement of <b>bonus</b> <b>issues</b> for the emerging stock markets of China. Results show that the issues with a high bonus ratio (number of bonus shares in the issue/number of existing shares) usually attract positive returns for both Chinese (A-share traders) and foreign (B-share traders) residents. Issues with a low bonus ratio are rewarded with negative returns for A-share traders and do not stimulate significant activity by B-share traders. The hypothesis of semi-strong form market efficiency is rejected only for small-bonus issues traded on the A-share market; the B-share market displays stronger evidence of semi-strong form market efficiency than the A-share market.
