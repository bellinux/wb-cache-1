50|$|There {{was also}} {{activity}} in the single decker fleet. Some of the AEC Regal IV RFs had been refurbished in the 1960s, with twin headlights, curved windscreens, new side mouldings and improved interiors, mainly allocated to Green Line services. There were 14 Willowbrook bodied AEC Reliances at Hertford garage, which had been bought by London Transport in 1965.

The first 110 were delivered with 66 seats in a high density 2+3 layout, including several removable seats {{at the front of}} the bus, which can be removed to allow the provision of wheelchair space; the final 50 buses were delivered with 62 seats and a permanent wheelchair area to save time in taking out and putting back the removable seats.

A planned service increase to route 464, including introduction of variation 474, was cancelled following the decision, as was planned route 78 to run every week from Cranleigh to Chichester Market. Countryliner are {{to focus on}} a reduced amount of local <b>bus</b> <b>work,</b> it is intended that by October 2011 all routes will have moved on to the Countryliner Sussex Limited licence, and by then most of the coach fleet will have been disposed of after the revocation of the C&S Coach Travel Limited licence.

50|$|The Cummins V6 {{had that}} manufacturer's {{patented}} intermediate-pressure fuel pump and governor system, supplying the fuel to open-cup injectors through internal drilled fuel galleries, four-valve cylinder heads and tappet-actuated injection. This made the engine less than suitable for slow speed stop-start work, {{even at the}} de-rated bus setting of 150 bhp at 2100 rpm. It was also a noisy unit in operation, said {{to sound like a}} contemporary Formula One racing car. Especially on <b>bus</b> <b>work</b> problems developed with damaged tappets, burnt valves, damaged valves, damaged pistons, damaged blocks, clogged injectors, cylinder block failures, smoke emissions and excessive wear as well as roughness and noise in operation, a tendency to refuse to restart when hot, refusal to start in general and endemic overheating, sometimes resulting in radiator caps being blown off and steam and scalding water jetting out behind the bus. Bournemouth Corporation had seventeen engine replacements over eleven buses during the warranty period and PMT (the largest customer with 58 buses and six coaches) had two Cummins engineers permanently resident in Stoke-on-Trent assisting their engineers until 1969.|$|E
50|$|Eastern Scottish's {{variants}} {{were used}} on bus, long-distance express services and tours, {{and were not}} generally withdrawn early. Western used its similarly but had always had a shorter-life policy for its vehicles and the first of their Pennine 7s were offered for sale at around the seven year mark, four of its early T-type coaches were converted for wheelchair access, with 24 seats and a central wheelchair lift spreading the type to Central and Midland Scottish. Central Scottish's example is at the Glasgow Vintage Vehicle Trust's Bridgeton garage where restoration has started. When new SBG subsidiaries were established in 1985 and Eastern lost its westernmost garages, Kelvin, Midland, Central, Clydeside and Lowland Scottish inherited Pennine 7s, Kelvin ridding itself of them as early as it could as it attempted standardisation. Not as well known as the Leopard, they sold less quickly on the second-hand market but operators including Stevensons of Uttoxeter and Burton and North Eastern Bus Service of Newcastle standardised on the Seddon for deregulated <b>bus</b> <b>work.</b> The last examples saw out {{the turn of the}} century with Allander, Milngavie on school contracts and with Morley, Whittlesey on rural Cambridgeshire services.|$|E
5000|$|In Kiev, Ukraine and {{probably}} other places marshrutkas evolve into [...] "everybody pays" [...] fast going buses. The vehicles can be small, medium-sized, and sometimes big buses, {{with a higher}} fare than on ordinary municipally funded buses, and the main thing about marshrutkas is they don't carry pensionaries and the disabled, and depending on the particular city, students, law enforcement workers, and civil servants (pass holders) for free. [...] Marshrutkas will not take more free passengers (invalids) then strictly limited quantity of one per marshrutka, while in ordinary buses, trolley buses and trams quantity of them is not limited and more categories of people (pensionaries etc.) have right to ride for free. And {{this is the reason}} why there are many times more marshrutkas in the city than ordinary buses, trolley buses and trams altogether. Since municipally funded buses must transport pass holders for free, naturally pass holders tend to use a municipal bus vs a private bus. The word [...] "taxi" [...] is needed just to answer the question why they have no free-ride obligations as part of their franchise, as ordinary municipal buses, which are usually [...] "full of free riders", are unprofitable and bring economical loss. A marshrut may even charge the same fare as a municipal bus in the city, but marshrut will still be profitable since there is an effective doubling of the price due to there being 1 or no free pass riders on board. Interesting fact: in the 1990s when local authorities temporarily lost their ability to finance city <b>bus</b> <b>work,</b> the bus drivers just installed in their buses windows tablets with inscription [...] "Taxomotor" [...] and that just meant that every passenger has to pay the fare.|$|E

40|$|The {{bus driver}} {{scheduling}} problem consists of assigning <b>bus</b> <b>work</b> to drivers {{so that all}} the <b>bus</b> <b>work</b> is covered and a combination of the number of drivers and associated costs is minimised. Restrictions imposed by logistic, legal and union agreements complicate the problem. Successful present day systems for computerised driver scheduling often use mathematical programming combined with heuristics. Purely heuristic approaches have found it very difficult to produce efficient driver schedules for large scheduling problems. Furthermore, some of these approaches may not be easily adaptable to different conditions. This thesis presents two new ways of using constraint satisfaction to form driver schedules. The two methods differ in their approach, one being a systematic constraint programming approach and the other being an adaptation of a local search method called GENET. The constraint programming approach uses a similar approach to mathematical programming systems in selecting the schedule fr [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{bus driver}} {{scheduling}} problem involves assigning <b>bus</b> <b>work</b> to drivers {{in such a}} way that all the <b>bus</b> <b>work</b> is covered and the number of drivers and duty costs is minimised. This is complicated by the fact that there are restrictions on the formation of valid duties. A review of computerised scheduling systems is presented, along with a more detailed description of one such system which uses a set covering model to produce a schedule from a set of previously generated valid duties. This method first solves the Linear Programming relaxation, and then uses Branch and Bound techniques to search for a good integer solution. Improvements to this system are detailed. Most systems which use mathematical programming methods to solve the driver scheduling problem need heuristics to reduce the size of the problem since there are potentially many thousands of valid duties, even for small problems. Column generation is a technique which implicitly considers a much larger number of duties, whils [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In {{planning}} {{urban bus}} operations, scheduling the drivers {{is the next}} stage after allocating buses to the timetabled journeys to produce a set of bus workings. Driver scheduling involves constructing a set of shifts such that every bus is always assigned a driver; the number of shifts is minimized; and each shift obeys the agreed rules on such matters as maximum driving time, minimum mealbreak time, and so on. The bus driver scheduling problem can be modelled as an integer linear programming problem. A {{very large number of}} possible shifts is generated, and a subset covering all the <b>bus</b> <b>work</b> is selected to form the driver schedule. TRACS II is a widelyused bus and train driver scheduling system using this approach which has been developed at the University of Leeds.
