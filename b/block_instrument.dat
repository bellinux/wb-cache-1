50|$|The {{accident}} {{illustrated the}} need for starting signals, block working, and some interlocking between the starting signals and the <b>block</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|R

50|$|Steelworks {{is located}} 1 mile and 421 yards {{away on the}} Chester Lines (Up and Down Chester). Absolute Block is {{operated}} with a <b>block</b> <b>instrument</b> in each box. Steelworks is still operating on the Chester Lines.|$|E
50|$|On 2 December 1955, 11 {{passengers}} {{died and}} 41 were injured when an electric passenger train from Waterloo to Windsor and Chertsey (dividing at Staines) {{collided with the}} rear of a steam hauled goods train. The accident occurred in thick fog and was caused by irregular <b>block</b> <b>instrument</b> operation by the signalman at Barnes Junction. See Barnes rail crash for more information.|$|E
5000|$|B {{immediately}} {{offers the}} train on to C by sending the [...] "Is Line Clear?" [...] bell signal; if C accepts it he repeats the bell signal and places his block indicator to [...] "Line Clear", which moves {{the position of}} the upper needle indicator in B's <b>block</b> <b>instrument</b> to repeat that indication. B may now clear his signals for the train.|$|E
50|$|Trains were {{controlled}} by a 'lock and block' system whereby the trains operated treadles on the single line {{to interact with the}} <b>block</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1951 a {{rear-end}} collision {{took place at}} Stobcross; a signalman worked the <b>block</b> <b>instruments</b> irregularly, {{and there were two}} wrong-side defects in the lock and block system that enabled this.|$|R
50|$|The {{accident}} {{would have}} been prevented if the line had been fitted with track circuits which would have prevented the <b>block</b> <b>instruments</b> and the signals from being cleared. However, at the time track circuits were relatively new.|$|R
50|$|A train {{approaching}} a section {{is offered by}} a signalman to his counterpart at the next signal box. If the section is clear, the latter accepts the train, and the first signalman may clear his signals to give permission for the train to enter the section. This communication traditionally takes place by bell codes and status indications transmitted over a simple wire circuit between signalmen using a device called a <b>block</b> <b>instrument,</b> although some contemporary block working is operated wirelessly. This process is repeated for every block section a train passes through.|$|E
5000|$|After an interval, {{the train}} will arrive and pass B; {{as it does}} so, B sends [...] "Train Entering Section" [...] on the block bell to C. Then C {{acknowledges}} the bell signal and places the <b>block</b> <b>instrument</b> to [...] "Train On Line". As the train passes, he restores his signals to danger, and when {{the whole of the}} train passes B complete with tail lamp attached, B sends the [...] "Train Out Of Section" [...] bell signal (2-1) to A and when A acknowledges it, he places his block indicator to [...] "Normal". The block section between A and B is now normal and A can offer B another train, if he has one.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were several}} {{significant}} features. Firstly, the modern rolling stock withstood the violent collision well, {{apart from the}} last coach which was totally destroyed; older coaches would have been crushed, with much heavier loss of life. Secondly, the Inspecting Officer felt that the signalman had been promoted beyond his level of competence for such a busy box, and the assessment and training procedures for signalmen should be improved. Thirdly, he recommended that the block instruments should {{be linked to the}} track circuits to prevent future occurrences {{in such a way that}} a [...] "Line clear" [...] indication could only be given on the <b>block</b> <b>instrument</b> if the track circuits had registered passage of a train; this was widely adopted and known as Welwyn Control.|$|E
50|$|Home and {{starting}} banner signals were used, electrically controlled, for each direction.Trains were, {{at that time}} uniquely, controlled by a development of the Syke's 'lock and block' system whereby the trains operated treadles on the single line {{to interact with the}} <b>block</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{a simple}} double line {{configuration}} where the signal boxes are A, B and C in succession, the signal box at B {{will have two}} <b>block</b> <b>instruments,</b> one for trains in both directions in the section between A and B, and one for trains in both directions in the section between B and C.|$|R
50|$|A {{disaster}} at such {{an intermediate}} location occurred on the Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway at Foxcote, near Radstock, in the Foxcote collision of 1876. This occurred before the S&DJR was equipped for token working and was relying on <b>block</b> <b>instruments</b> only - a catalogue of errors led to two passenger trains entering the same section from opposite ends.|$|R
50|$|Signal boxes {{also served}} as {{important}} communications hubs, connecting the disparate parts of a rail line and linking them together to allow the safe passage of trains. The first signalling systems were made possible by technology like the telegraph and <b>block</b> <b>instrument</b> that allowed adjacent signal boxes to communicate {{the status of a}} section of track. Later, the telephone put centralised dispatchers in contact with distant signal boxes and radio even allowed direct communication with the trains themselves. The ultimate ability for data to be transmitted over long distances has proven the demise of most local control signal boxes. Signalmen next to the track are no longer needed to serve as the eyes and ears of the signalling system. Track circuits transmit train locations to distant control centres and data links allow direct manipulation of the points and signals.|$|E
5000|$|In this <b>block</b> <b>instrument,</b> a disc, {{instead of}} a {{telegraph}} needle, oscillated between a pair of electromagnets to indicate [...] "line clear" [...] or [...] "train on line" [...] in a window {{at the bottom of}} the instrument's face. The indication [...] "line blocked", the default position for block instruments, was displayed through one half of each of the other two indications being displayed in the window. Each indication was obtained by pressing on a key which was held down by a wire frame passing over the key [...] (see illustration). This type of instrument survived in use beyond the end of the GWR in 1948, and into the 21st century. The final operational Network Rail example, located in Banbury South signal box was finally decommissioned at 02:00 on 30 July 2016 shortly before the box's demolition.|$|E
50|$|The <b>block</b> <b>instrument</b> {{consists}} of a small cabinet; its front face displays two indicators — telegraph needles — and has a commutator handle (some early designs of block instruments had miniature semaphore arms instead of needles). The upper indicator shows {{the state of the}} forward section, on the line leading away from the signal box. The commutator is used by the signalman to indicate the state of the section approaching his signal box, and the lower indicator repeats the commutator position. All indications are repeated on a similar instrument {{at the other end of}} the block section, in the associated signal box. The commutator has three positions and each of the two indicators has three positions: normal (or line blocked), line clear, and train on line. Either integral to the instrument or separately mounted, there is a single-stroke bell and a bell operating device, either a tapper or a plunger.|$|E
50|$|The {{signalling}} bell, {{also known}} as a block bell, is used in conjunction with the <b>block</b> <b>instruments</b> if the bell is not integrated with them. It is a single stroke design and relays the codes from adjacent signal boxes. Each bell has its own distinctive sound to alert the signalman which instrument needs to be attended to.|$|R
500|$|Within the tunnel, {{two lines}} were laid with a [...] gap between. To {{accommodate}} both the standard gauge trains of the GNR and the broad gauge trains of the GWR, the track was three-rail mixed gauge, the rail nearest the platforms being shared by both gauges. Signalling {{was on the}} absolute block method, using electric Spagnoletti <b>block</b> <b>instruments</b> and fixed signals.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} North Devon {{line was}} signalled using disc and crossbar signals. With a considerable network in Devon now open or in course of completion, there were greatly increasing traffic volumes, and the LSWR decided to modernise the signalling. On 1 October 1873 {{most of the}} stations from Copplestone to Umberleigh were equipped with semaphore signals and <b>block</b> <b>instruments</b> using Preece's three wire system.|$|R
5000|$|Let us {{consider}} {{the process of}} signalling a train in the up direction (from A to C) past a signal box B. The signal box in rear is A and the signal box in advance is C. The block indicators at B are in the Normal position. The signalman at A [...] "offers" [...] the train to B by sending an [...] "Is Line Clear?" [...] code on the block bell; for example to offer an express passenger train, he sends four beats consecutively; an ordinary passenger train is offered by sending three beats, and after a pause one more beat, usually written as 3-1. If the signalman at B can accept the train safely (see below) he [...] "accepts" [...] the train by repeating the bell signal, and placing the commutator on his <b>block</b> <b>instrument</b> for the section from A to [...] "Line Clear". The [...] "Line Clear" [...] is repeated at box A, and allows the signalman at A to clear, or [...] "pull off", his signals.|$|E
50|$|The block {{telegraph}} instruments at Charfield {{had three}} different positions: train on line, line clear and line blocked. Not {{only was it}} {{in control of the}} station and sidings, the signal box was a block post for two sections: Berkeley Road to Charfield (up line) and Charfield to Wickwar (down line), and was in control of signals for the entrance to the station and the following block sections on each line. (This was standard block working - even though the box may control a section it controlled the signals for the entrance to next section along the line.) The down line signals protected trains in both the down line of the station and Charfield to Wickwar section of the down line which followed. It was on the down line that events would occur. The <b>block</b> <b>instrument</b> could not be set to line clear until the train on the line had passed over a treadle at the next signal box and the signalman in the box had sent his consent by telegraph. The Block instruments were interlocked with the signal levers so that unless the respective instrument stood at 'line clear', they could not be cleared to accept a train. This prevented any false signals being given by mistake.|$|E
40|$|Food {{frequency}} questionnaires, major {{tools in}} epidemiologic studies, are often criticized for biased and imprecise intake estimates. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the performance of two widely used food frequency questionnaires, a reduced 60 -item Block questionnaire and a 153 -item Willett food frequency questionnaire, relative to three 24 -hour recalls administered by telephone. The dietary data were collected in 1991 from a group of healthy women age 25 - 49 years (n = 101) during the baseline period of a weight-loss intervention study in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Total energy and macro- and micronutrient intakes were compared across methods by using four analytic approaches: comparison of means and correlation coeffi-cients, regression analysis, and estimation of percent agreement between each questionnaire and recalls. The <b>Block</b> <b>instrument</b> showed an overall underestimation bias, but was more successful in categorizing individuals on percent energy from fat and carbohydrate intakes than was the Willett instrument. The Willett instrument showed no overall underestimation bias and was more successful in classifying individuals on vitamin A and calcium intakes. Diverging performance characteristics of diet assessment methods have an implication for the design of studies, interpretation of results, and comparison of findings across studies.

50|$|Construction of the {{extension}} to Glencorse was heavily delayed due to {{problems with the}} embankments. On 16 May 1877 Major General Hutchinson inspected {{the extension}}, and criticised the absence of <b>block</b> <b>instruments</b> for signalling trains; {{there had been no}} decision by the Company on the method of working, and an undertaking was required from the NBR (as intended purchasers of the line) {{as well as from the}} Loanhead and Roslin Company.|$|R
50|$|The Armathwaite {{signal box}} {{was built by}} the Midland Railway and placed in service on 16 July 1899. It was {{equipped}} with a 16-lever tumbler frame. The box was decommissioned on 15 January 1983. During 1992 it was restored by the Friends of the Settle to Carlisle Line and furnished with original Midland Railway <b>block</b> <b>instruments</b> and painted in original colours. It can be visited on Sundays by prior arrangement.|$|R
50|$|On 23 January 1911, a {{passenger}} train {{ran into the}} rear of a coal train at Coke Ovens, near Pontypridd. Eleven {{people were killed and}} five were seriously injured. The accident was due to irregularities in the block working by the signalman, who forgot that he had admitted the first train into the section and had not received Train Out of Section for it. The <b>block</b> <b>instruments</b> were of the two-position type.|$|R
50|$|Open-View - This {{referred}} to {{the removal of the}} top section of the control wheel in 1967 models. These had been rectangular, they now became “ram’s horn” shaped, thus not <b>blocking</b> the <b>instrument</b> panel as much.|$|R
50|$|Holmes {{was charged}} with {{manslaughter}} and found guilty, but was given an absolute discharge - a decision strongly supported by the jury and by public opinion. The railway company was criticised for its cavalier treatment of Holmes, {{and there had been}} contributory negligence; by the Otterington signalman who knew of Holmes's condition and took no action when there was silence from his signal box for nearly a quarter of an hour, and by the crew of the goods train who remained halted outside Holmes's signal box for several minutes without sending a crewman to the signal box in accordance with Rule 55 to ensure that their train was properly protected by the signals and <b>block</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{absence of}} modern safety devices {{became an issue}} for {{practically}} all the railways of Great Britain in the 1870s, and in October 1875 a proposal had been put forward for the introduction of block signalling. Preece's <b>Block</b> <b>Instruments</b> were installed between Ryde and Sandown, and a new signal box was commissioned at Brading in 1882. The trains staff and ticket system was still in use, but in April 1891 trials began with the Webb and Thompson Electric Train Staff; by September 1891 the whole line from Ryde to Ventnor was equipped. Continuous brakes too were now a necessity and in January 1892 the Board decided to fit the Westinghouse air brake at an estimated cost of £1,740.|$|R
50|$|Before Hayes {{could reach}} the signal box, the {{signalman}} at Winwick Quay to the south rang Call attention for an express train from Euston to Blackpool. As the Regulations did not permit him to send the Is Line Clear? bell signal until he had received Train Out of Section for the local train, he intended to send the bell signal Shunt engine for following train to pass upon acknowledgment of Call attention, i.e. he expected Bloor to switch the local train temporarily to another running line and halt it while the express passed. However, Bloor forgot that the local train was standing at his signals, and {{thought that he had}} failed to clear his <b>block</b> <b>instruments</b> after a preceding train. He gave the reply, Train out of section and cleared his signals.|$|R
5|$|The GWR's Telegraph Superintendent (1855–1892) {{patented}} the Disc <b>Block</b> Telegraph <b>Instrument</b> {{that was}} used to safely control the dispatch of trains. First used on the Metropolitan Railway in 1863 and the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway in 1864, it was later used on many other lines operated by the company.|$|R
50|$|According to Francisco Javier Durán García, New York City based {{instrument}} maker, {{the traditional}} art of güira making involves a tree stump, hammer, nail, metal tube, and wood <b>block.</b> The <b>instrument</b> is hand fashioned from sheet metal into a (roughly 13") long cylindrical tube along with repeatedly-dimpled (not fully perforated) tubular (exterior) surface.|$|R
