5000|$|The {{nickname}} [...] "Firefly" [...] is {{not found}} in wartime official documents, but was adopted, due to the bright muzzle flash of the main gun. It was sometimes used at unit level (brigade/regiment) war diaries from March 1944, with another nickname being 'Mayfly'. During the war, Shermans with 17-pounder guns were usually known as '1C', '1C Hybrid', or 'VC', depending on the <b>basic</b> <b>mark</b> of the vehicle. In British nomenclature, a [...] "C" [...] {{at the end of}} the Roman numeral indicated a tank equipped with the 17-pounder.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>Mark</b> I is an imp, in a box, that (theoretically) remembers your {{diary and}} memos. It can also {{recognise}} handwriting (a {{reference to the}} Apple Newton) but can't understand it; it also claims {{to be able to}} tell you what the time is in Klatch, but obviously this is not very useful as they are made in Ankh Morpork, and don't know what time it is anywhere else. It can use precognition to find out what your appointments are before you do, but this may lead to it following a different timeline, which can be disturbing ("...beep... Things To Do Today: Die..."). The Mark II is similar, but also has the ability to change colour, knows several different alarm calls, and can memorise an entire conversation (running its memory backwards to recall it). The Mark V, also known as [...] "The Gooseberry" [...] (a play on the BlackBerry) can deliver messages through Bluenose (cf. Bluetooth), which involves running extremely fast down to the nearest clacks tower, as well as play games and whistle songs through iHUM (cf. iTunes). It can also, unlike the Mark I, read, and its most useful function (to Commander Vimes, at least) is an ability to sort through large amounts of paperwork quickly—Vimes eventually lets it out of its box and employs it as his unofficial secretary.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a morphophonemic method for marking stress in Modern Russian stress para digms, with a comparison to Common Slavic. It proceeds from Zaliznjak’s notion of Russian “trivial ” and “non-trivial ” stress, where trivial refers to constant paradigmatic stem-stress. Trivial stress (histori cally, AP A) can be marked on a constant syllable {{and is not}} of special interest to this paper, where {{the emphasis is on}} representing non-trivial stress. Non-trivial stress has its <b>basic</b> <b>mark</b> on one of the extreme stem syllables, either stem-initial or stem-final; it is subject to only one rule: stress movement to the first desinential syllable. Basic stem-final stress can be identified with historical AP B; basic initial stress with AP C. There is a single mark for either B or C in any subparadigm (subparadigms refer to number for nouns and tense for verbs). For nouns, the realization of B or C stress can be predicted {{on the basis of the}} desinence in nominative and genitive cases, respectively. Type B is correlated with the genitive: a zero genitive implies no movement from basic stem-final. Type C is correlated with the nominative: des-inences unmarked for height (zero or mid) imply no movement from basic stem-initial; a type C high-vowel nominative predicts oblique case desinential stress; a low-vowel nominative predicts full subpara-digmatic desinential stress. Thus, AP B and C stress movement to the desinence is correlated with direct case sonority. In the verb, non-triv-ial stress has the B vs. C opposition only in the present tense; B moves stress to single-vowel desi nences; C generalizes desinential stress. Th...|$|E
50|$|For the UK regiments, the Centurion was {{the primary}} British tank of the post-World War II period. Development of the tank began in 1943 and {{manufacture}} of the Centurion began in January 1945. It first entered combat with the British Army in the Korean War in 1950, {{in support of the}} UN forces. It was noted for its high mobility, able to climb to the top of hills that were considered difficult for infantry, let alone tanks. Upgraded to mount the L7 105 mm gun, it became the UK's first main battle tank. Between 1946 and 1962, 4,423 Centurions were produced, consisting of 13 <b>basic</b> <b>marks</b> and numerous variants.|$|R

The <b>basic</b> <b>marks</b> range from 4 to 10; for university admissions though a more complex system called MeP (Meritë-Preference) is used.

40|$|The author {{analyzes}} {{conditions in}} the Croatian village {{at a time when}} many fundamental changes are taking place in Croatia and when the social future must be planned in the light of those changes. He draws the following conclusions: (1) In Croatia the peasantry, as the peasant class, disintegrated and was replaced in the village by several social strata, more or less connected with land ownership. However, within this »remnant of the peasantry« the stratum of modern market farmers is emerging, and they are expected to transform the backward agrarian structure. (2) The size of the family farm has not undergone any essential change and mechanization, and other facets of modernization, have introduced a certain degree of tension that must, in a certain number of farms, lead to production and physical expansion. (3) Rural social groups lost their <b>basic</b> <b>mark</b> of autarky and have become more or less integrated into the overall social tissue. This was contributed to most by several waves of urbanization that spread from cities to the rural area. However, urbanization marginalized great rural areas, and it is an important national task to reintegrate them into the life of the country. (4) Many villages suffered badly in the war for the homeland and their renewall will be hard and demand scientific preparation. (5) In this crisis period the Croatian village can cushion social upheaval, but it will be a terrible mistake if, because of the needs of the whole society, the village is made to carry too great a burden which will block its already incipient transformation...|$|E

40|$|The Republic of Macedonia, {{like other}} European countries, is {{following}} the trend of continuous decline {{of the population in}} some parts of the country. Along with this decline in population, there is also a decline in the rate of population growth and population density occurring in certain regions. On the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, regarding the distribution of population density, visible differences can be observed in some parts, and even regions. These demographic changes happened due to the economical opportunities within the country, and also to the migration movements. In this paper, beside the analysis of the data of the population movement and the density of the population (1953 – 2011), we shall also observe the <b>basic</b> <b>marks</b> of the urban and rural environments, in terms of the changes occurring in spatial distribution by regions as well as identifying the factors that influenced the formation of the disparity in today’s asymmetric spatial distribution of the population...|$|R
