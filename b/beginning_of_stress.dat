In the Nojima fault, there is no convincing evidence that the permeability enhancement was due to notable earthquakes. In general, an increase in normal stress (confining stress) reduces both fracture aperture widths and permeability (Baghbanan and Jing 2008).

30|$|The {{experimental}} and fitting {{results showed that}} the permeability coefficients of cracked Jingle and Baode laterites gradually decreased with the increase of loading, and the decrease in magnitude of the permeability coefficient was gradual under the application of identical loading.

In addition, in similar soil specimens, larger crack widths corresponded to larger variations of permeability during stress recovery. When stress completely recovered, the soil specimens with larger crack widths exhibited larger permeability coefficients. This indicated that smaller mining soil crack widths resulted in smaller permeability coefficients after stress recovery, and larger crack widths resulted in more severe soil damage and limited permeability recovery.|$|E

On day 6, 1 h prior to restraint stress, both restraint-naive and repeatedly restrained rats were injected s. c. with either vehicle (propylene glycol) or one of three corticosteroid receptor antagonist treatments: selective MR antagonist (RU 28318 or spironolactone), selective GR antagonist (RU 40555), or both MR and GR antagonists combined (RU 28318 +RU 40555).

In the present study, we have used intronic {{in situ hybridization}} to the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) gene to measure hypothalamic CRF gene transcription after stress {{as well as its}} modulation by glucocorticoids. Using this and conventional exonic in situ hybridization we examined the time course of changes in c-fos mRNA, and CRF heteronuclear RNA (hnRNA) and mRNA concentrations in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of male Wistar rats after restraint stress. In addition, we determined the effects of adrenalectomy and dexamethasone administration on c-fos and CRF gene expression in the PVN. Restraint stress induced a rapid induction (within 5 min) of c-fos mRNA and CRF hnRNA expression in the PVN.

40|$|A major neuroendocrine {{mechanism}} in a stress reaction is the {{activation of the}} hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in a rapid increase in circulating corticotrophin (ACTH) and subsequent rise in glucocorticoids, which are critical for successful adaptation (Dallman et al., 1992). Thus, plasma levels of ACTH and glucocorticoids are a good indicator of stress response intensity, particularly in its acute phase (Pignatelli et al., 1998). Bearing in mind that ACTH is the major stimulator of adrenal cortical function, investigation of their relationship is of great importance in both basal and stress conditions. Short-term ACTH treatment provokes a decrease in volume of the lipid-droplet compartments in rat zona glomeruloza (ZG) cells, and a rise in plasma and intracellular concentrations of corticosterone and aldosterone (Mazzocchi et al., 1986). ZG growth (i. e. {{the volume of the}} ZG and its parenchymal cells) is stimulated by angiotensin II, sodium deficiency, potassium loading, ACTH and prolactin, and inhibited by somatostatin. Rat ZG hyperplasia and mitotic activity were found to be induced by chronic ACTH and cAMP treatment (Lewinski and Szkudlinski, 1981; Payet and Lehoux, 1982). It was shown that ACTH itself, or stress-induced increased ACTH secretion, exert tropic (short-term) and trophic (long-term) effects on the adrenocortical zona fasciculata (ZF) and zona reticularis (ZR). Tropic effects involve an immediate increase in corticosteroid hormone secretion, which appears about 10 ·min after the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and reaches the maximum 15 – 30 ·min later (Jaanus et al., 1970; Normand et al., 1982). The trophic effect of ACTH involves an increase in adrenal mass and in the steroidogenic capacity of adrenocortical cells (Nussdorfer, 1986). Other results suggest that the HPA axis is activated in any type of stress (acute or chronic), but the adrenal gland response varies (Nussdorfer and Mazzocchi, 1983; Robba et al., 1985; Mazzocchi et al., 1986). Taking all this into consideration, as well as {{the fact that there are}} very few reports on morphological and quantitative analysis of adrenal glands after acute heat exposure, we decided to determine the effect of high ambient temperarture on rat adrenal gland morphology...|$|E

To {{gain a better understanding}} <b>of</b> heat <b>stress</b> responses in P. ternata, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis.

Increased relative ion leakage and lipid peroxidation suggested that oxidative stress was frequently generated in rice leaves exposed to high temperature. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) was used to analyze heat-responsive proteins. More than 600 protein spots were reproducibly detected on each gel; of these spots, 20 were up-regulated, and 7 were down-regulated. A total of 24 proteins and protein species were successfully identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. These proteins and protein species were found to be primarily small heat shock proteins (58 %) as well as proteins involved in RNA processing (17 %), photosynthesis (13 %), chlorophyll biosynthetic processes (4 %), protein degradation (4 %) and defense (4 %).

One hundred broilers were heat-stressed for 0, 2, 3, 5, and 10  h, respectively, by rapidly increasing the ambient temperature from 22 ± 1 °C to 37 ± 1 °C. Obvious elevations of plasma creatine kinase indicate damage to myocardial cells after heat stress. Hsp 70 and Hsp 90, and their corresponding mRNAs in the heart tissue of heat-stressed broilers, elevated significantly after 2  h of heat exposure and decreased quickly with continued heat stress.
