5|$|Alan Eagleson was not repentant for {{his actions}} during game eight. Eagleson {{was not the only}} one jostled by police; Eagleson's wife and the Canadian ambassador's wife were also jostled. Eagleson woke up with bruises from his treatment. Eagleson was not sorry, but he regretted the {{incident}} and planned to not get involved in further series. He did get a letter of support from Robert Ford, the ambassador, who <b>basically</b> agreed with Eagleson's actions. Mail and messages about the incident was mostly in favour of Eagleson. According to Ted Blackman, Canadian fans were <b>basically</b> understanding of Team Canada's actions as being provoked while the team was under duress.|$|E
5|$|Mark VII – <b>basically</b> an {{upgraded}} Mark V. Like the Mark VI, {{produced on}} the new factory in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|These {{components}} are <b>basically</b> categories of service, which {{are determined by}} the level of training obligation and commitment that a member is required to meet.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, new {{versions}} of the Merlin (the 600- and 700-series) were designed and produced for use in commercial airliners such as the Avro Tudor, military transport aircraft such as the Avro York, and the Canadair North Star which performed in both roles. These engines were <b>basically</b> military specification with some minor changes to suit the different operating environment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Basically,</b> {{a lot of}} {{you know}} the {{political}} situation in my professional career is not positive. It's been really, really hard. I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.|$|E
5|$|Due to his weak {{performances}} in the opening matches, Harvey was omitted for the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were <b>basically</b> a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team {{and went on to}} win by an innings. The omission signified that Harvey was on the outer with regards to Test selection.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the season Chris and Carmine head to Los Angeles to try to sign Ben Kingsley for a film they are trying to make called Cleaver, which is <b>basically</b> a mix of The Godfather and Saw. But Kingsley passes on the picture. While in Los Angeles Chris goes back to using cocaine for a short period of time.|$|E
5|$|Floating gardens, {{labelled}} the 'Rad' in tye Kashmiri {{language are}} a special {{feature of the}} lake. They <b>basically</b> constitute of matted vegetation and earth, but are floating. These are detached {{from the bottom of}} the lake and drawn to a suitable place (generally to the north west of the houseboats' location) and anchored. Given its rich nutrient properties, tomatoes, cucumbers and melons are grown with noteworthy results.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal {{broaching}} machines {{are designed for}} pull broaching, surface broaching, continuous broaching, and rotary broaching. Pull style machines are <b>basically</b> vertical machines laid on the side with a longer stroke. Surface style machines hold the broach stationary while the workpieces are clamped into fixtures that are mounted on a conveyor system. Continuous style machines {{are similar to the}} surface style machines except adapted for internal broaching.|$|E
5|$|I {{read this}} book, and I was totally stunned. At {{the same time}} I was pretty upset with myself that I didn't know this book. I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and for me this book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I <b>basically</b> made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years, he was {{assisted}} {{by the man}} who had become his trusted prime-minister, Johan Göransson Gyllenstierna (1635–1680). Some sources say the king was <b>basically</b> dependent on Gyllenstierna,. His sudden death in 1680 opened up the road to the monarch, and many men tried to get close to the king to take Gyllenstierna's place.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that the spiking activity of hippocampal neurons is associated spatially, and {{it was suggested that}} the mechanisms of memory and planning both evolved from mechanisms of navigation and that their neuronal algorithms were <b>basically</b> the same.|$|E
5|$|The Paris agglomeration's urban {{sociology}} is <b>basically</b> that of 19th century Paris: its fortuned classes are situated in its west and southwest, and its middle-to-lower classes are in its north and east. The remaining areas are mostly middle-class citizenry dotted with islands of fortuned populations located there due to reasons of historical importance, namely Saint-Maur-des-Fossés {{to the east}} and Enghien-les-Bains to the north of Paris.|$|E
5|$|The Shasekishū, {{a book of}} Buddhist parables {{from the}} Kamakura period, {{makes a point of}} {{distinguishing}} between good and bad tengu. The book explains that the former are in command of the latter and are the protectors, not opponents, of Buddhism– although the flaw of pride or ambition has caused them to fall onto the demon road, they remain the same <b>basically</b> good, dharma-abiding persons they were in life.|$|E
5|$|The ads {{were based}} on the film series and was <b>basically</b> an {{amalgamation}} of both directors visuals. For example, The Batmobile was the one used in Batman and Batman Returns, while the Batsuit was a combination of what was worn by Val Kilmer in Batman Forever and George Clooney in Batman & Robin. The commercials also featured the Danny Elfman Batman theme from Tim Burton's two films.|$|E
5|$|The {{major areas}} that are highly {{productive}} and buildable are <b>basically</b> in Tablas and Sibuyan. These include Odiongan, San Andres, Looc and Santa Fe in Tablas Island. All three municipalities in Sibuyan Island, on the other hand, have substantial level to gently sloping lands. Overall, good developable lands represent about 13 percent of the province’s total area.|$|E
5|$|The music kizomba from Angola and cabo-love from Cape Verde {{are also}} {{derivatives}} of this French Antillean compas music style, which sounds <b>basically</b> the same, {{although there are}} notable differences once you become more familiar with these genres. A main exponent of this subgenre is Ophelia Marie. Other Zouk Love artists come from the French West Indies, the Netherlands, and Africa.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were <b>basically</b> a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance for all players to gain a psychological advantage over their opponents for the Tests.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} <b>basically</b> {{describes the}} existence of the jet stream, a westerly current of air with maximum wind speeds close to the tropopause which is (even though other factors are also important) the result of the temperature contrast between equator and pole.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{it is seen}} in {{the time}} of Emperor Hadrian (r.117–138 CE), the {{punishment}} for parricide was <b>basically</b> made optional, in that the convict might be thrown into the arena instead. Furthermore, a rescript from Hadrian is preserved in the fourth century CE grammarian Dositheus Magister that contains the information that the cart with the sack and its live contents was driven by black oxen.|$|E
5|$|What you're <b>basically</b> {{saying is}} that Joe Berrios {{should get out of}} politics. If my {{brothers}} or whoever wants to come and work in government, they shouldn't be allowed to work in government. If you want to pass a law that says one individual is in government, then none of their friends or relatives can work in government, then you should pass that law.|$|E
5|$|<b>Basically</b> it’s {{just about}} having a throwdown {{out in the woods}} — that’s what we used to do in high school. I can’t {{honestly}} sit here and say that I do it much anymore, I’m getting too old, but it’s fun for me to sing about those times and the crazy stuff that I used to do, and the crazy stuff that I know somewhere, as we speak right now, kids are doing somewhere in somebody's field. I know you're tearing it up out there.|$|E
5|$|<b>Basically,</b> the {{parallels}} concern {{the presence of}} first-(magico-juridical) and second-(warrior) function representatives on the victorious side of a war that ultimately subdues and incorporates third function characters, for example, the Sabine women or the Norse Vanir. Indeed, the Iliad itself has also been examined in a similar light. The ultimate structure of the myth, then, is that the three estates of Proto-Indo-European society were fused only after a war between the first two against the third.|$|E
5|$|Blind cricket, {{which is}} played <b>basically</b> {{the same as}} {{conventional}} cricket but using larger stumps and wickets and a white ball so that players may see it much more easily, is also played at the college, and RNC has its own cricket team, which competes in the British Blind Sport (BBS) National Cricket League. The college also features acoustic shooting, a sport which uses air rifles fitted with photoelectric cells which convert light reflected from targets into sound.|$|E
5|$|Child labour is {{a complex}} problem that is <b>basically</b> rooted in poverty. The Indian {{government}} is implementing the world's largest child labour elimination program, with primary education targeted for ~250million. Numerous non-governmental and voluntary organisations are also involved. Special investigation cells {{have been set up}} in states to enforce existing laws banning employment of children (under 14) in hazardous industries. The allocation of the Government of India for the eradication of child labour was 10million in 1995–96 and 16million in 1996–97. The allocation for 2007 is 21million.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{requires}} a deep fryer or other device {{in which the}} chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat. The process of deep frying is <b>basically</b> placing food fully in oil and then cooking it {{at a very high}} temperature. The pieces are prepared as described above. The fat is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature. The pieces are added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.|$|E
5|$|I needed {{somebody}} who could perform, and {{who also had}} a lot of endurance, because we were shooting in Atlanta at the end of July. Silicone doesn’t have cell structure, like foam does. It doesn’t breathe. So Brian was <b>basically</b> encased in a sixty-pound wet-suit. Every part of his body was covered. He had facial prosthetics, hands, full legs, feet. It was all glued down. It wasn’t like we could take him out between takes. He was in.|$|E
5|$|In WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2008, GM Mode was {{combined}} into one game mode called WWE 24/7 Mode. This <b>basically</b> allowed Superstars to train, make special appearances or other actions between matches during full calendar years. After achieving specific goals through the game, a percentage will increase {{of becoming a}} WWE Hall of Famer / General Manager of the Year winner, and the mode does not end until this percentage reaches 100%.|$|E
5|$|In {{telecommunication}} networks, heterodyning {{is used to}} move {{frequencies of}} individual signals to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television system can carry 500 television channels {{at the same time}} because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. Continuous wave (CW) doppler radar detectors are <b>basically</b> heterodyne detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.|$|E
5|$|Johnston was {{the left}} {{out for the}} next fixture, which was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were <b>basically</b> a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team, with Johnston omitted. It was {{a chance for the}} Australian bowlers to gain a psychological advantage, with Len Hutton, Denis Compton and Bill Edrichthree of England's first four batsmenall playing. Australia won by an innings to give an indication of their strength.|$|E
5|$|Manchester Liners House, the company's new {{headquarters}} in Salford Docks, was officially opened on 12 December 1969 by the High Commissioner for Canada. The design was advanced for its {{day and it}} remains <b>basically</b> unchanged today except for re-glazing. The unusual curved facade of the ten-storey building was designed to echo the bridge shape of the Manchester Miller. Later renamed Furness House, it {{was built on the}} former Manchester Ship Canal railway sidings between Nos. 8 and 9 Docks.|$|E
5|$|Scholars today remain {{divided on}} the merits of the {{electronic}} barrier system and the efficacy of the bombing campaigns that it directed. The claims of destruction made by the U.S. Air Force, both during and after the war, were originally taken as given. The only exception to this rule was at the CIA, which discounted Air Force claims at the time by as much as 75 percent. This was understandable {{due to the fact that}} the Vietnamese were <b>basically</b> silent during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Some {{linguists}} {{have argued}} that Nahuatl displays the properties of a non-configurational language, meaning that word order in Nahuatl is <b>basically</b> free. Nahuatl allows all possible orderings of the three basic sentence constituents. It is prolifically a pro-drop language: it allows sentences with omission of all noun phrases or independent pronouns, not just of noun phrases or pronouns whose function is the sentence subject. In most varieties independent pronouns are used only for emphasis. It allows certain kinds of syntactically discontinuous expressions.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{can introduce}} {{variability in the}} decompression outcome through the lung function. The first variable is individual susceptibility. The filtering capacity of the lung may be assumed to vary between individuals, and for a given individual, from day to day, and {{may account for the}} inter-personal and intra-persona variability which have been observed in DCS susceptibility. <b>Basically,</b> a good diver is a good bubble filter. This is a justification for divers who seek top physical fitness for severe decompression exposures.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were <b>basically</b> a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It {{was a chance to}} gain a psychological advantage, and given Harvey's early struggles in English conditions and his failure to pass 25 in his first six innings, he was overlooked as Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings.|$|E
