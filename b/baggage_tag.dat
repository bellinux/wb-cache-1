40|$|The International Air Transport Association (IATA) {{introduced}} a global standard for {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) <b>baggage</b> <b>tags</b> in 2005. With an average 1 per cent of the 1. 7 billion passenger checked-in baggage that were mishandled, IATA estimates that, if its RFID standard is adopted on a global scale, the annual industry savings would be US 76 million. The key drivers are operational efficiency gains: reducing costs of airline business operations and improving service quality. As such, the RFID baggage initiative has not explicitly focused on how the RFID <b>baggage</b> <b>tags</b> {{can be used to}} provide security information to a wide array of industry stakeholders (airlines, airports, passengers and government agencies). Despite the individual RFID trials and implementations by airlines and airports (IATA, 2007), network-level initiatives and real-time integrated operations are still few in number and the overall industry adoption and proactive use of RFID for security remains low. The urgent need for research exists to investigate a network -level problem of integrating RFID-enabled baggage security into operations for collaborative advantage. In this paper, we have focused on a network (of airlines/airports) as the unit of analysis vis-a-vis an individual organisation. The aim of this research in progress paper is to identify key barriers to integrating RFID-enabled baggage security into operations.

50|$|ICAO {{codes are}} {{separate}} and different from IATA codes, which are generally used for airline timetables, reservations, and <b>baggage</b> <b>tags.</b> For example, the IATA code for London's Heathrow Airport is LHR and its ICAO code is EGLL.

In general IATA codes are usually derived from the name of the airport or the city it serves, while ICAO codes are distributed by region and country. Far more aerodromes (in the broad sense) have ICAO codes than IATA codes, and to add to the confusion IATA codes are sometimes assigned to railway stations.|$|R

30|$|In {{this issue}} of our journal, we have five {{original}} paper contributions. Three of these touch on a subject which currently receives a lot of attention, particularly among logistics researchers with an engineering background: It {{is the issue of}} decentralized, “autonomous” controls in those very complex logistical systems where centralized planning and centralized organizational arrangements are reaching their limits. The paper by Falkenberg/Overmeyer/Ventz/Krühn proposes an innovative modular system for many intra-plant logistics operations. The paper by Nopper/Ten Hompel analyzes the cost advantages of self-organizing airport baggage handling systems—where the cost of RFID-tags over traditional <b>baggage</b> <b>tags</b> have to be compensated—from a life-cycle perspective. Mayer, in an invited paper which received the BVL scientific paper award, presents his research on deadlock prevention in industrial materials flow systems—again based on the application of modular, locally controlled conveyor units.|$|R

40|$|Luggage {{handling}} is {{an extremely}} complex system that involves many moving parts at once. Due {{to the importance of}} a well-functioning baggage handling system in airports, an analysis has been completed on the current system and its drawbacks. The research is limited to the standard baggage handling system and baggage screening technology currently used in airports. Conclusions have been drawn from past research studies that have been done in major airports, as well as research on better technology the industry is currently working to implement. It has been determined that there are millions of bags mishandled each year, costing the airline industry millions of dollars. As a result, airlines and airports are investing in the testing and implementation of new technologies such as RFID <b>baggage</b> <b>tags,</b> automated bag drop kiosks, and permanent bag tags. These technologies are thought to improve the efficiency and accuracy of luggage handling, benefiting airports, airlines, and passengers. In the future, it is likely travelers and airlines will see an improvement in the number of mishandled bags and cost savings with the potential benefits of improved technology...|$|R
40|$|With {{the trends}} towards Internet of Things (IoT) and massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) it is {{expected}} that the 5 th Generation of mobile communications (5 G) will have a significant amount of battery powered devices (e. g. sensors, <b>baggage</b> <b>tags,</b> etc.). Therefore, battery efficiency and duration will be essential, especially for those devices in remote locations and/or restricted areas. It would be difficult to predict all the 5 G use cases, for example, that may arise from IoT however {{it is expected}} that for some of these the tradeoff between efficient power savings modes and low-latency system access might be essential. In order to solve this tradeoff, called herein User Equipment (UE) sleeping problem, the paper proposes a novel state model for 5 G Radio Access Networks (RAN) that relies on a novel state called “connected inactive” where both the UE and the network does not throw away context information. The state is envisioned to be highly configurable in order to address unpredictable use cases possibly with different requirements. It is shown via protocol signaling diagrams that that the proposed solution enables a quick and lightweight transition from inactive to active data transmission...|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} of RFID systems {{depends on a}} number of factors including: RF interference, deployment environment, configuration of the readers, and placement of readers and tags. While RFID technology is improving rapidly, a reliable deployment of this technology is still a significant challenge impeding wide-spread adoption. This research investigates system software solutions for achieving a highly reliable deployment that mitigates inherent unreliability in RFID technology. We have considered two different problem domains for large scale RFID deployment. One is item tracking and the other is guidance-monitoring. Item tracking considers applications that have statically placed RFID readers to observe the RFID tagged objects in motion. An airport scenario to observe the <b>tagged</b> <b>baggage</b> or warehouse scenarios to track the tagged goods are examples of item tracking applications. A self guided tour, search and rescue scenario or a visually impaired person looking for direction and guidance in a tagged environment are examples of item location applications. It is observed that there is a notion of path that follows the direction and flow of the mobile items in the item tracking applications and a path gets created along the direction and flow of the mobile object in item location applications. A system level knowledge of the data flow can benefit the system in different aspects such as improved reliability, resource management and real time response. We have designed and implemented an RFID middleware for item tracking: RF²ID (Reliable Framework for Radio Frequency Identification) to organize and support queries over data streams in an efficient manner. We have developed (1) a virtual reader abstraction to improve the potentially error-prone nature of reader generated data (2) a novel path abstraction to capture the logical flow of information among virtual readers. Prototype implementation using both RFID readers and simulated readers using an empirical model of RFID readers show that RF²ID is able to provide high reliability, support path-based object detection and use efficient resource management techniques. We propose a middleware solution that takes into account the data flow information for item location application that requires real time response. The guidance-monitoring scenario considers mobile RFID readers that traverse in a tagged environment. We consider the scenario of an Assisted Living Center for elderly residents as a motivating guidance-monitoring application. The solution for guidance-monitoring system is called GuardianAngel. The application scenario considers a tagged indoor environment with residents having their own RFID readers to provide them with adequate information about the surroundings. The guidance and monitoring requirement can be conflicting. The guidance information requires very fine grain information about the environment to make proper decisions. On the other hand, the monitoring system must not have a fine grain knowledge which can introduce concerns such as privacy concerns. We consider this aspect during the design and implementation. The system is a two layered infrastructure that has the upper layer which is the monitoring layer. This layer is in charge of monitoring of the actors in the environment. The monitoring layer is physically a set of distributed virtual stations that have the knowledge about the environment. The environment itself is equipped with RFID tags. The residents of the environment have the mobile object that has a sensing element and a computing element (e. g., handhold device with a portable RFID reader) - the guidance server runs on this mobile object. The guidance server is in charge of making local decisions to the users. It is resource limited and asks for new information from the virtual stations as needed. The guidance server also provides the monitoring server with the information regarding the status of the mobile object. But the status information is not fine grain information - the guidance server wraps up the information {{over a period of time}} and over a larger region to hide the detailed information of the users. The system uses the logical path based abstraction to guide the users. We have implemented the real testbed using grid structured RFID devices along with scalability study using emulated RFID readers. The basic contribution of our work is based on providing novel middleware solution that is able to serve the application taking into account the inherent un{{reliability of}} RFID technology. Our path abstraction that uses the physical flow of data as an ally to generate a logical system level flow enhances the performance in many ways. Ph. D.
