5|$|In the {{interior}} of the pyramid a descending passage led, behind three granite portcullises, to an antechamber, three magazine rooms and the burial chamber. In it, pieces of alabaster and a faience <b>bead</b> <b>on</b> a gold thread were discovered as well as many fragments of what was originally a large sarcophagus of dark grey basalt. The sarcophagus was sunk into the floor of the burial chamber together with a niche for the canopic chest of the king to its north-east. An almost complete mummy was discovered in the remnants of the sarcophagus. An examination by Ahmed Batrawi of these skeletal remains, excavated in the mid-1940s under the direction of Abdel Salam Hussein, suggests that Djedkare {{died at the age of}} 50 to 60 years old.|$|E
25|$|The {{wire frame}} {{may be used}} either with {{positional}} notation like other abaci (thus the 10-wire version may represent numbers up to 9,999,999,999), or each bead may represent one unit (so that e.g. 74 can be represented by shifting all beads on 7 wires and 4 beads on the 8th wire, so numbers up to 100 may be represented). In the bead frame shown, {{the gap between the}} 5th and 6th wire, corresponding to the color change between the 5th and the 6th <b>bead</b> <b>on</b> each wire, suggests the latter use.|$|E
25|$|Newton's laws can be {{difficult}} to apply to many kinds of motion because the motion is limited by constraints. For example, a <b>bead</b> <b>on</b> an abacus is constrained to move along its wire and a pendulum bob is constrained to swing at a fixed distance from the pivot. Many such constraints can be incorporated by changing the normal Cartesian coordinates to a set of generalized coordinates that may be fewer in number. Refined mathematical methods have been developed for solving mechanics problems in generalized coordinates. They introduce a generalized momentum, also known as the canonical or conjugate momentum, that extends the concepts of both linear momentum and angular momentum. To distinguish it from generalized momentum, the product of mass and velocity is also referred to as mechanical, kinetic or kinematic momentum. The two main methods are described below.|$|E

Stottlemeyer breaks into Cage's office to discover that Tennyson is dying in a hospital and has days left to live. Stottlemeyer confronts Cage, who says the only way he will allow access to Tennyson is if Monk solves the ambassador's murder.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Lutz, {{the head}} of the Chrysler Corporation at the time, said in his 2003 book Guts that the Medallion, and its larger line mate, the Premier were [...] "salesproof" [...] in that no matter how {{attractive}} and competitive the cars were, customers in large enough number to ensure success just would not take notice. In reality, the corporation was drawing a tighter <b>bead</b> <b>on</b> [...] "import intenders," [...] and rather than working with an independent Renault, Chrysler shifted the Eagle models to badge engineered cars sourced from its Japanese partner since 1971, Mitsubishi Motors. At the time, Chrysler was investing in the Diamond-Star Motors manufacturing joint venture and building a new plant in Normal, Illinois, with an annual capacity of almost a quarter million vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|During the Siege of Atlanta, {{members of}} the 33rd quickly learned that they were safer below ground, than above it. At first they slept on the ground just behind their trenches, but with snipers and {{artillery}} wreaking havoc among them at night, they decided {{to stay in their}} ditch at all times. Perpendicular trenches were dug to grant access to their rear areas, while lights of any kind were banned at night. With no means of washing their clothes, the men suffered from insect infestations; their agony was compounded by a nearby Federal gun that managed to draw a transverse <b>bead</b> <b>on</b> their trench, doing considerable damage until Confederate counter-battery fire finally silenced it. [...] The regiment was gradually moved to the left each day, digging new ditches in the red clay soil with bayonets, spades or picks, but never engaging the enemy.|$|E
2500|$|Less {{impressed}} was GameSpot, who {{awarded the}} GameCube version 6.5 out of 10 and the PS2 version 5.4. They found the technical {{issues of the}} game to be too significant; [...] "Bounty Hunter suffers from an array of technical problems that have plagued other third-person action games. You can move the camera perspective using the right analog stick, but the camera will still cause you some major headaches when in tight corridors or when trying to draw a <b>bead</b> <b>on</b> a specific enemy. Often it'll automatically swivel to point you in entirely the wrong direction. Clipping and collision-detection issues also abound." [...] They also criticized the graphics and the overall gameplay, concluding that [...] "Star Wars Bounty Hunter may have all the basic ingredients needed for a solid third-person action game, but it falls flat in the execution and is far too often cumbersome, confusing, or {{in some other way}} un-fun to be recommendable on its own merits. Serious Star Wars aficionados should enjoy the game's story, but they'll be forced to slog through a lot of tedious action to see how it pans out." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report an ultra-low-cost spherical ball lens based cell phone {{microscopy}} and image processing algorithms {{to analyze the}} amount of immunomagnetic <b>beads</b> <b>on</b> micro-contact printed gratings. The spherical ball lens provides approximately 100 × magnification but the recorded images are not clear and are noisy. By using the image-processing algorithms, the noise can be reduced and the images can be enhanced to quantify the amount of immunomagnetic <b>beads</b> <b>on</b> micro-contact printed lines. This method, which is portable and low-cost, can be an alternative read out mechanism for biosensing applications using immunomagnetic <b>beads</b> <b>on</b> micro-contact printed surface receptors. Further, 0. 0335 mg/mL was the lowest magnetic bead concentration that could be detected above the inherent noise level of the spherical ball lens...|$|R
2500|$|Lili's {{official}} {{style is}} street fighting, combined with gymnastic maneuvers such as flips, cartwheels and handstands. Mike Reilly of Game Revolution {{said in his}} 2006 review of Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection that Lili [...] "takes {{a good deal more}} practice to master", an issue he opined was offset by the presence of an in-game training mode. Brett Elston of GamesRadar commented on Lili's fighting style in the game: [...] "She doesn't really have a definable combat style, so it's mostly all flash and sexy high kicks ... her quick movements and wide-reaching legs make her ideal for first-timers—those same dance-like attacks also make it hard to get a <b>bead</b> <b>on</b> her next move". According to IGN, Lili's counterattacks, juggles and wall fighting in Tekken 6 are known to cause a lot of damage, but she was [...] "lacking in the low attack department and many of her crush attacks will leave her vulnerable." [...] Mike Harradence of PlayStation Universe wrote in 2012 that Lili's [...] "quirky yet ultimately unique style provides ample opportunity for juggles and she can mix it up {{with the best of them}} thanks to an arrange of low-mid attacks." [...] Tom Goulter of GamesRadar said of the character in Tekken Tag Tournament 2: [...] "Lili is one of the series' less fleet-footed characters, with a gymnastic-influenced style that favors precision over quickness." ...|$|E
