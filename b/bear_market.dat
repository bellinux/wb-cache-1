40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 This {{dissertation}} aims {{to investigate}} the interaction between financial markets and the real economy both in the short-run and the long-run. The first two chapters study the distinct interactions between different states of stock markets and the real economy at monthly frequencies. The third chapter studies the causality between financial development and the economic growth at business cycle frequencies (i. e., three or five-year spells). The first chapter focuses on forecasting {{the states of the}} stock market. While previous literature classifies the stock market into binary states (i. e., bull and <b>bear</b> <b>markets),</b> I further classify U. S. stock <b>bear</b> <b>markets</b> into good <b>bear</b> and bad <b>bear</b> <b>markets.</b> The latter are the <b>bear</b> <b>markets</b> associated with contraction phases of future cash flows, while the former are not. Most bad <b>bear</b> <b>markets</b> are accompanied with NBER declared recessions, whereas good <b>bear</b> <b>markets</b> are not accompanied with serious depressions in the real economy. Commonly used macroeconomic predictors also signal differently in forecasting these two types of <b>bear</b> <b>markets.</b> The value premium has distinct magnitude across the two types of <b>bear</b> <b>markets.</b> By applying a multinomial logit model with three alternatives (bull, good bear, and bad <b>bear</b> <b>markets)</b> to predict stock market states, I provide richer information about stock market states which is beneficial for policy makers and investors. In the second chapter, I examine the reliability and timeliness of using stock bad <b>bear</b> <b>markets</b> as early warning signals of economic recessions. I find that bad <b>bear</b> <b>markets</b> are much more reliable to predict recessions than conventional stock <b>bear</b> <b>markets</b> or the forecasting model that targets recessions directly. The forecasting model that predicts bad <b>bear</b> <b>markets</b> also provide timely information about the starts and the ends of economic recessions over NBER announcements. In the third chapter, I revisit the debate of “too much finance” on economic growth. I use different econometric methods in the dynamic panel data framework to address potential biases induced by the dynamic nature of economic growth and financial development but control the heterogeneity across countries. Particularly, I conduct a battery of robustness tests to examine weak instrument problems in the system GMM estimator, developed by Blundell and Bond (1998), and use Half-Panel Jackknife Fixed-Effect estimator, developed by Chudik, Pesaran, and Yang (2016), as an alternative method. I also take care of the outlier issue, which is particularly sensitive when there is nearly multicollinearity among explanatory variables. My empirical results find no sufficient evidence to support a positive causal effect, nor do I find a quadratic effect of financial development on economic growth...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates how limit orders affect {{liquidity}} in {{a purely}} order-driven futures market. Additionally, the possible asymmetric relationship between market depth and transitory volatility in bull and <b>bear</b> <b>markets</b> {{and the effect}} of institutional trading on liquidity provision behavior are examined as well. The empirical results demonstrate that subsequent market depth increases as transient volatility increases in bull markets. Market depth exhibits significantly positive relationship to subsequent transient volatility in bull markets. Additionally, although trading volume positively influences transient volatility in bull markets, no such relationship exists in <b>bear</b> <b>markets.</b> Liquidity provision decreases when institutional trading activity intensifies during <b>bear</b> <b>markets.</b> Thus, liquidity provision for limit orders differs between bull and <b>bear</b> <b>markets.</b> Copyright (c) 2009 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

25|$|Corporate {{transactional}} events generally {{fit into}} three categories: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and special situations. Distressed securities include such events as restructurings, recapitalizations, and bankruptcies. A distressed securities investment strategy involves {{investing in the}} bonds or loans of companies facing bankruptcy or severe financial distress, when these bonds or loans are being traded at a discount to their value. Hedge fund managers pursuing the distressed debt investment strategy aim to capitalize on depressed bond prices. Hedge funds purchasing distressed debt may prevent those companies from going bankrupt, as such an acquisition deters foreclosure by banks. While event-driven investing in general tends to thrive during a bull market, distressed investing works best during a <b>bear</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Elliott's model, {{market prices}} {{alternate}} between an impulsive, or motive phase, and a corrective phase on all time scales of trend, as the illustration shows. Impulses are always subdivided into {{a set of}} 5 lower-degree waves, alternating again between motive and corrective character, so that waves 1, 3, and 5 are impulses, and waves 2 and 4 are smaller retraces of waves 1 and 3. Corrective waves subdivide into 3 smaller-degree waves starting with a five-wave counter-trend impulse, a retrace, and another impulse. In a <b>bear</b> <b>market</b> the dominant trend is downward, so the pattern is reversed—five waves down and three up. Motive waves always move with the trend, while corrective waves move against it.|$|E

25|$|The {{performance}} of gold bullion is often compared to stocks as different investment vehicles. Gold is regarded {{by some as}} a store of value (without growth) whereas stocks are regarded as a return on value (i.e., growth from anticipated real price increase plus dividends). Stocks and bonds perform best in a stable political climate with strong property rights and little turmoil. The attached graph shows the value of Dow Jones Industrial Average divided by the price of an ounce of gold. Since 1800, stocks have consistently gained value in comparison to gold {{in part because of the}} stability of the American political system. This appreciation has been cyclical with long periods of stock outperformance followed by long periods of gold outperformance. The Dow Industrials bottomed out a ratio of 1:1 with gold during 1980 (the end of the 1970s <b>bear</b> <b>market)</b> and proceeded to post gains throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The gold price peak of 1980 also coincided with the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and the threat of the global expansion of communism. The ratio peaked on January 14, 2000 a value of 41.3 and has fallen sharply since.|$|E

As a trader, he was unscrupulous and serendipitous; in one instance he promised a group of Bostonian traders that he would not sell his holdings in the Norwich and Worcester Railroad below the price of 90 dollars a share, but promptly did so soon after when noticed its price slipping, earning him much condemnation and lasting outrage from other traders. But he was also known for his practiced judgement, the promptness of his dealings, and his great financial foresight; Little was able to predict Andrew Jackson's campaign against the Bank of the United States and the resultant Panic of 1837, and was able to protect his interests during the financial debacle by short selling his own holdings, a lucrative operation that earned him his most lasting title: [...] "The Great Bear of Wall Street."

40|$|Testing {{duration}} {{in stock}} markets concerns {{the ability to}} predict the turning points of bull and bear cycles. The Weibull renewal process {{has been used in}} previous studies to analyze duration dependence in economic and financial cycles. A goodness-of-fit test, however, shows that this model does not fit data from U. S. stock market cycles. As a solution, this study fits the modulated power law process that relies on less restrictive assumptions. Moreover, it measures both the long term properties of bull and <b>bear</b> <b>markets,</b> such as the tendency of the cycles to become shorter (or longer), as well as the short term effects, such as duration dependence. The results give evidence of negative duration dependence in all samples of bull markets and evidence of positive duration dependence in complete, peacetime and post WWII samples of <b>bear</b> <b>markets.</b> There is no evidence of any structural change in duration dependence after WWII in either bull or <b>bear</b> <b>markets.</b> The results show that bull and <b>bear</b> <b>markets</b> tend to get progressively shorter, but for bull markets this trend has accelerated since WWII whereas for <b>bear</b> <b>markets</b> this trend has decelerated since WWII.

40|$|Through this {{research}} {{we find that}} the asymmetric volatility phenomenon is reversed in the Shanghai Stock Exchange during bull markets.

We also find that volatility increases after stock price declines in <b>bear</b> <b>markets</b> especially for small stocks. This increase in volatility of small stocks after bad news in <b>bear</b> <b>markets</b> is partly driven by liquidity.

[...] Mobilization of all resources towards the war effort during the 8-year Iran-Iraq war did not help matters. Following {{the end of the}} war, the 1988 Budget Act re-established activity on the TSE, and within eight years the exchange saw its numbers rise to 249 companies listed. The Government fully embraced economic reforms and a privatization initiative in 1989 with a surge of activity in share activity of many state-owned companies through the defined targets in the first [...] "Five-Year Economic Reform" [...] where the Government together with the Parliament defined the economic prospects of the country for the coming five years. Attention to promotion of the private sector and new interest in the TSE brought life back to the market. However, lack of regulation and out-of-date legal framework led to crisis in the market leading to certain [...] "meltdowns". Over the 1996 to 2000 period an automated trading system was introduced, and a number of important regulatory mechanisms were strengthened. The market has experienced its share of highs and lows in the past years including topping the World Federation of Exchanges' list in terms of performance in 2004.

60|$|In {{due time}} {{we arrived in}} New York, and I had the supreme {{happiness}} of pointing out to the girls the State's Prison, the <b>Bear</b> <b>Market,</b> and the steeples of St. Paul's and Trinity-old Trinity, as it was so lately the fashion to style a church that was built {{only a few years}} before, and which, in my youth, was considered as magnificent as it was venerable. That building has already disappeared; and another edifice, which is now termed splendid, vast, and I know not what, has been reared in its place. By the time this is gone, and one or two generations of buildings have succeeded, each approaching nearer to the high standard of church architecture in the old world, the Manhattanese will get to understand something of the use of the degrees of comparison on such subjects. When that day shall arrive, they will cease to be provincial, and--not till then.|$|E
6000|$|The most inveterate Manhattanese, if he be {{anything}} {{of a man}} of the world, must confess that New York is, after all, but a rag-fair sort of a place, so far as the eye is concerned. I was particularly struck with this fact, even at that hour, as we went stumbling along over an atrociously bad sidewalk, my eyes never at rest, as any one can imagine, after five years of absence. I could not help noting the incongruities; the dwellings of marble in close proximity with miserable, low constructions in wood; the wretched pavements; and, above all, the country air of a town of near four hundred thousand souls: I very well know that many of the defects are to be ascribed to the rapid growth of the place, which gives it a sort of hobble-de-hoy look; but, being a Manhattanese by birth, I thought I might just as well own it all at once, if it were only for the information of a particular portion of my townsmen, who may have been under a certain delusion on the subject. As for comparing the bay of New York with that of Naples on the score of beauty, I shall no more be guilty of any such folly, to gratify the cockney feelings of Broadway and Bond Street, than I should be guilty of the folly of comparing the commerce of the ancient Parthenope with that of old New York, in order to excite complacency in the bosom of some bottegajo in the Toledo, or on the Chiaja. Our fast-growing Manhattan is a great town in its way--a wonderful place--without a parallel, I do believe, on earth, as a proof of enterprise and of the accumulation of business; and {{it is not easy to}} make such a town appear ridiculous by any jibes and innuendoes that relate to the positive things of this world, though nothing is easier than to do it for itself by setting up to belong to the sisterhood of such places as London, Paris, Vienna, and St. Petersburg. There is too much of the American notion of the omnipotence of numbers among us Manhattanese, which induces us to think that the higher rank in the scale of places is to be obtained by majorities. No, no; let us remember the familiar axiom of [...] "ne sutor ultra crepidum." [...] New York is just the queen of [...] "business," [...] but not yet the queen of the world. Every man who travels ought to bring back something to the common stock of knowledge; and I shall give a hint to my townsmen, by which I really think they may be able to tell for themselves, as by feeling a sort of moral pulse, when the town is rising to the level of a capital. When simplicity takes the place of pretension, is one good rule; but, as it may require a good deal of practice, or native taste, to ascertain this fact, I will give another that is obvious to the senses, which will at least be strongly symptomatic; and that is this: when squares cease to be called parks; when horse-bazaars and fashionable streets are not called Tattersalls and Bond Street; when Washington market is rechristened <b>Bear</b> <b>market,</b> and Franklin and Fulton, and other great philosophers and inventors, are plucked of the unmerited honors of having shambles named after them; when commercial is not used as a prefix to emporium; when people can return from abroad without being asked [...] "if they are reconciled to their country?" [...] and strangers are not interrogated at the second question, [...] "how do you like our city?" [...] then may it be believed that the town is beginning to go alone, and that it may set up for itself.|$|E
