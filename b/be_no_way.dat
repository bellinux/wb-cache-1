A graduate tax has been criticised because there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to recover the money from students who move to a different country, or foreign students who return home.|$|E

5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S. Lewis is the Argument from Reason: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then {{we have no reason}} for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.|$|E

5|$|In this context, a {{dependency}} graph is a graph {{that has}} a vertex for each object to be updated, and an edge connecting two objects whenever one of them needs to be updated earlier than the other. A cycle in this graph is called a circular dependency, and is generally not allowed, because there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to consistently schedule the tasks involved in the cycle.|$|E
5|$|Being a scientist, {{above all}} else, Huxley {{presented}} agnosticism {{as a form}} of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic. According to philosopher William L. Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.|$|E

Distinguished scientists, such as Harold Jeffreys and Charles Schuchert, were outspoken critics of continental drift.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} postulates that if, as naturalism entails, all of {{our thoughts}} are {{the effect of a}} physical cause, then we have no reason for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. However, knowledge is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if naturalism were true, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of knowing it (or anything else), except by a fluke.|$|E
25|$|All {{physical}} boxing {{proposals are}} naturally dependent on {{our understanding of}} the laws of physics; if a superintelligence could infer and somehow exploit additional physical laws that we are currently unaware of, {{there is no way to}} conceive of a foolproof plan to contain it. More broadly, unlike with conventional computer security, attempting to box a superintelligent AI would be intrinsically risky as there could be no sure knowledge that the boxing plan will work. Scientific progress on boxing would be fundamentally difficult because there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to test boxing hypotheses against a dangerous superintelligence until such an entity exists, by which point the consequences of a test failure would be catastrophic.|$|E

25|$|Several {{additional}} utilities {{were published}} in the May 1987 issue of Compute!'s Gazette along with SpeedScript 3.2. ScriptRead was developed to identify and preview SpeedScript documents on a disk, with the ability to scratch any files no longer needed. This was an important addition as on a single-drive system there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to save work if the disk became full. SpeedSearch provided full-text search of all SpeedScript documents on a disk, returning a count of how many times the searched word or phrase was used in each document. Date and Time Stamper introduces a program to the disk drive that adds time stamps to files on disk, then executes SpeedScript.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of qualia thus {{is governed by}} one's point of view, and that inevitably brings with it philosophical and neurophysiological presuppositions. The question, therefore, of what qualia can be raises profound issues {{in the philosophy of}} mind, since some materialists want to deny their existence altogether: on the other hand, if they are accepted, they cannot be easily accounted for as they raise the difficult problem of consciousness. There are committed dualists such as Richard L. Amoroso or John Hagelin who believe that the mental and the material are two distinct aspects of physical reality like the distinction between the classical and quantum regimes. In contrast, there are direct realists for whom the thought of qualia is unscientific as there appears to <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of making them fit within the modern scientific picture; and there are committed proselytizers for a final truth who reject them as forcing knowledge out of reach.|$|E
500|$|Cooper {{discusses}} how {{he feels}} Minority Report emphasizes the future importance over the control of imagery. According to him, the images captured from the precogs' visions in the film bestow power on those who control their processing. He says the film warns viewers that those who control images must be carefully overseen so as to prevent the abuse of power, and that the film presents [...] "governance as a problem of image arrangement." [...] The film also presents a future world where government probes use advanced media technology to monitor its citizenry. Cooper says the quandary arises when the film intimates that there were will <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to escape the media industry's omnipotence in the future, {{while at the same}} time defending [...] "the need for image manipulating institutions." [...] He feels that this logically raises another issue in that the same concern could be leveled towards image-makers such as DreamWorks, and he says the [...] "film's virtue lies in provoking this question." [...] He notes that the film's tranquil ending concludes with the Andertons looking out into a peaceful exterior with only rain visible, and the precogs reading in their isolated, idyllic farm, and both families apparently free of electronic surveillance.|$|E

2500|$|The aim of tableaux is to {{generate}} progressively simpler formulae until pairs of opposite literals are produced or no other rule can be applied.
