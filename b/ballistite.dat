500|$|Alfred Nobel (...) {{was born}} on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm, Sweden, into a family of engineers. He was a chemist, engineer, and inventor. In 1894, Nobel {{purchased}} the Bofors iron and steel mill, which he made into a major armaments manufacturer. Nobel also invented <b>ballistite.</b> This invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives, especially the British smokeless powder cordite. As a consequence of his patent claims, Nobel was eventually involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over cordite. Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime, with most of his wealth from his 355inventions, of which dynamite is the most famous.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} [...]303 British service cartridge employed {{black powder}} as a propellant, and was adopted for the Lee–Metford rifle, which had rifling designed to lessen fouling from this propellant. The Lee–Metford {{was used as}} a trial platform by the British Committee on Explosives to experiment with many different smokeless powders then coming to market, including <b>Ballistite,</b> Cordite, and Rifleite. [...] <b>Ballistite</b> was a stick-type smokeless powder composed of soluble nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. [...] Cordite was a stick-type or 'chopped' smokeless gunpowder composed of nitroglycerine, gun-cotton, and mineral jelly, while Rifleite was a true nitrocellulose powder, composed of soluble and insoluble nitrocellulose, phenyl amidazobense, and volatiles similar to French smokeless powders. [...] Unlike Cordite, Riflelite was a flake powder, and contained no nitroglycerine. [...] Excessive wear of the shallow Lee–Metford rifling with all smokeless powders then available caused ordnance authorities to institute a new type of barrel rifling designed by the RSAF, Enfield, to increase barrel life; the rifle was referred to thereafter as the Lee–Enfield. [...] After extensive testing, the Committee on Explosives selected Cordite for use in the Mark II [...]303 British service cartridge.|$|E

The other relevant [...] "nitro" [...] composition developed in the 19th century was the nitroaromatic functionality with its Ar-N(O)-O linkage, where Ar stands for a Benzene ring. Trinitrotoluene and picric acid are examples of nitroaromatics. compositions nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin were developed by Henri Braconnot in 1832 and Ascanio Sobrero in 1846, respectively. The development of smokeless powder stemmed from efforts by numerous workers to produce an improved gun propellant providing better resistance to moisture, greater muzzle velocity, and generally greater reliability. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, nitroester compositions Poudre B, <b>Ballistite,</b> and Cordite were the major smokeless propellants. Significantly, many nitroesters were capable of detonation without confinement. The classic gunpowder composition was only capable of Deflagration in the open.|$|E
50|$|Alfred Nobel then {{developed}} <b>ballistite,</b> {{by combining}} nitroglycerin and guncotton. He patented it in 1887. <b>Ballistite</b> {{was adopted by}} a number of European governments, as a military propellant. Italy was the first to adopt it. The British Government and the Commonwealth governments adopted cordite instead, which had been developed by Sir Frederick Abel and Sir James Dewar of the United Kingdom in 1889. The original Cordite Mk I consisted of 58% nitroglycerin, 37% guncotton, and 5.0% petroleum jelly. <b>Ballistite</b> and cordite were both manufactured in the forms of cords.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} year, 1887, Alfred Nobel invented and patented a smokeless propellant {{he called}} <b>Ballistite.</b> It {{was composed of}} 10% camphor, 45% nitroglycerine and 45% collodion (nitrocellulose). Over time the camphor tended to evaporate, leaving an unstable explosive.|$|E
5000|$|The HVAR was {{designed}} by engineers at Caltech during World War II as an improvement on the 5-Inch Forward Firing Aircraft Rocket (FFAR), which had a 5 inch cm diameter warhead but an underpowered 3.25 inch cm diameter rocket motor. The desire for improved accuracy from the flatter trajectory of a faster rocket spurred the rapid development. HVAR had a constant 5" [...] diameter for both warhead and rocket motor, increasing propellant from 8.5 to 23.9 lb of <b>Ballistite.</b> U.S. <b>Ballistite</b> propellant had a sea level specific impulse of over 200 seconds, compared with about 180 seconds for the British Cordite, German WASAG and Soviet PTP propellants. Hercules Powder Company was the principal U.S. supplier of high performance extruded <b>Ballistite</b> propellants: 51.5% nitrocellulose, 43% nitroglycerine, 3.25% diethyl phthalate, 1.25% potassium sulphate, 1% ethyl centralite, and 0.2% carbon black. The propellant in U.S. 3.25" [...] and 5" [...] rocket motors consisted of a single large X-shaped cross-section, [...] "cruciform" [...] <b>Ballistite</b> grain cavity. This went against the common practice of filling rocket motors with different numbers of smaller same-sized tubular charges with a round cavity, the number depending on motor diameter. The central hole in a tubular charge {{makes it more difficult}} to extrude, requiring a softer propellant blend that also yields somewhat lower performance. Rocket ∆V increased from 216 m/s for the 5" [...] AR to 420 m/s for HVAR, giving the coveted flat trajectory. This was still somewhat slower than the German R4M World War II rocket's launch velocity of some 525 m/s, with a smaller calibre (55 mm) and resultant 520 g weight of RDX explosive in the R4M ordnance.|$|E
50|$|It was {{propelled}} by being mounted atop a rifle's 22 mm grenade launching adapter, and being launched by a <b>ballistite</b> (blank) cartridge.

50|$|The {{remains of}} old storage {{magazines}} are {{prominent in the}} landscape around the old Nobel's Explosives site in Ayrshire, many protected by large earth banks which acted as blast walls; these are not all gunpowder magazines, as the site has long been associated with other explosives, particularly dynamite and <b>ballistite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Nobel died in 1896 {{and he did}} {{not leave}} an {{explanation}} for choosing peace as a prize category. As he was a trained chemical engineer, the categories for chemistry and physics were obvious choices. The reasoning behind the peace prize is less clear. According to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, his friendship with Bertha von Suttner, a peace activist and later recipient of the prize, profoundly influenced his decision to include peace as a category. Some Nobel scholars suggest it was Nobel's way to compensate for developing destructive forces. His inventions included dynamite and <b>ballistite,</b> both of which were used violently during his lifetime. <b>Ballistite</b> was used in war and the Irish Republican Brotherhood, an Irish nationalist organization, carried out dynamite attacks in the 1880s. Nobel was also instrumental in turning Bofors from an iron and steel producer into an armaments company.|$|E
50|$|Alfred Nobel {{patented}} <b>Ballistite</b> in 1887 whilst he {{was living}} in Paris. His formulation was composed of 10% camphor and equal parts of nitroglycerine and collodion. The camphor reacted with any acidic products of the chemical breakdown of the two explosives. This both stabilized the explosive against further decomposition and prevented spontaneous explosions. However, camphor tends to evaporate over time, leaving a potentially unstable mixture.|$|E
50|$|Accused of “high treason against France” {{for selling}} <b>Ballistite</b> to Italy, Nobel moved from Paris to Sanremo, Italy in 1891. On December 10, 1896, Alfred Nobel succumbed to a {{lingering}} heart ailment, suffered a stroke, and died. Unbeknownst to his family, friends or colleagues, {{he had left}} most of his wealth in trust, in order to fund the awards that would {{become known as the}} Nobel Prizes.

50|$|The STRIM 65 is an {{anti-tank}} {{rifle grenade}} that the French Army used from 1961 to 1978, under the designation 65 AC 28. This {{and the older}} 73mm Modèle 1950 (similar in appearance to an Energa grenade) were the standard anti-tank munitions in French service. A 22 mm grenade launching adapter mounted atop the rifle's barrel held the grenade until the firing of a <b>ballistite</b> (blank) cartridge provided the propulsive force to launch the grenade.|$|E
50|$|The Germans adopted <b>ballistite</b> {{for naval use}} in 1898, {{calling it}} WPC/98. The Italians adopted it as filite, in cord instead of flake form, but {{realising}} its drawbacks changed to a formulation with nitroglycerine they called solenite. In 1891 the Russians tasked the chemist Mendeleev with finding a suitable propellant, he created nitrocellulose gelatinised by ether-alcohol, which produced more nitrogen and more uniform colloidal structure than the French use of nitro-cottons in Poudre B. He called it pyrocollodion.|$|E

50|$|Another of Pelouze's {{students}} {{was the young}} Alfred Nobel, who returned to the Nobel family's defunct armaments factory and began experimenting with the material around 1860; it did, indeed prove {{to be very difficult}} to discover how to handle it safely. In the 1860s Nobel received several patents around the world for mixtures, devices and manufacturing methods based on the explosive power of nitroglycerine, eventually leading to the invention of dynamite, <b>ballistite</b> and gelignite from which he made a fortune.|$|E

50|$|They were {{returned}} to UK from China {{and each of the}} two siege companies fired 100 rounds from them but they had not been regarded seriously. However, they were issued to the new third siege company and used for annual practice where numerous defects became clear. Minor modifications were made but the critical defect, no elevation below 42 degrees, giving a high trajectory, made accurate fire impossible with the methods of the time. In addition, replacing the <b>ballistite</b> cartridges with cordite reduced the maximum range by 1000 yards m.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, a {{government}} committee in Great Britain, called the [...] "Explosives Committee" [...] and chaired by Sir Frederick Abel, monitored foreign developments in explosives. Abel and Sir James Dewar, {{who was also}} on the committee, jointly patented a modified form of <b>Ballistite</b> in 1889.

Using acetone as a solvent, it was extruded as spaghetti-like rods initially called [...] "cord powder" [...] or [...] "the Committee's modification of Ballistite", but this was soon abbreviated to cordite.|$|E
50|$|The Anglo-American Explosives Company began {{manufacturing}} its shotgun {{powder in}} Oakland, New Jersey in 1890. DuPont began producing guncotton at Carneys Point Township, New Jersey in 1891. Charles E. Munroe of the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island patented a formulation of guncotton colloided with nitrobenzene, called Indurite, in 1891. Several United States firms began producing smokeless powder when Winchester Repeating Arms Company started loading sporting cartridges with Explosives Company powder in 1893. California Powder Works began producing {{a mixture of}} nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose with ammonium picrate as Peyton Powder, Leonard Smokeless Powder Company began producing nitroglycerine-nitrocellulose Ruby powders, Laflin & Rand negotiated a license to produce <b>Ballistite,</b> and DuPont started producing smokeless shotgun powder. The United States Army evaluated 25 varieties of smokeless powder and selected Ruby and Peyton Powders as the most suitable {{for use in the}} Krag-Jørgensen service rifle. Ruby was preferred, because tin-plating was required to protect brass cartridge cases from picric acid in the Peyton Powder. Rather than paying the required royalties for <b>Ballistite,</b> Laflin & Rand financed Leonard's reorganization as the American Smokeless Powder Company. United States Army Lieutenant Whistler assisted American Smokeless Powder Company factory superintendent Aspinwall in formulating an improved powder named W.A. for their efforts. W.A. smokeless powder was the standard for United States military service rifles from 1897 until 1908.|$|E
50|$|Nobel Industries Limited {{was founded}} in 1870 by Swedish chemist and {{industrialist}} Alfred Nobel {{for the production of}} the new explosive dynamite. The factory was overseen and run by George McRoberts. McRoberts and John Downie raised the £24,000 needed to found the company rather than Nobel himself. It was chaired by the Glasgow shipbuilder, Charles Randolph (1809-1878). Ardeer, on the coast at Ayrshire, was chosen for the company's first factory. The business later diversified into the production of blasting gelatine, gelignite, <b>ballistite,</b> guncotton, and cordite. At its peak, the factory employed nearly 13,000 men and women.|$|E
