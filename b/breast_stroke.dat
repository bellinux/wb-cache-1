A total of 38 {{swimming}} athletes (20 male and 18 female) {{were selected to}} represent the U.S. at the 2008 Paralympic Games. Melissa Stockwell, a former United States Army officer who lost her left leg to a roadside bomb, became the first Iraq War veteran to be selected for the Paralympics. The roster also included Dave Denniston, an NCAA champion in the 200-yard <b>breast</b> <b>stroke,</b> two-time Olympic hopeful, and world record breaker who was paralyzed in a 2005 sledding accident.|$|E
2500|$|The {{butterfly}} stroke has three major parts, the pull, the push, and the recovery. These {{can also be}} further subdivided. From the initial position, the arm movement starts very similarly to the <b>breast</b> <b>stroke.</b> At the beginning the hands sink a little bit down with the palms facing outwards and slightly down at shoulder width, then the hands move out to create a Y. This is called catching the water. The pull movement follows a semicircle with the elbow higher than the hand and the hand pointing towards {{the center of the}} body and downward to form the traditionally taught [...] "keyhole".|$|E

The water was decidedly cold and he was glad when he reached the sloop. Clutching her rail where it was lowest amidships he endeavored to pull himself out. To his disgust he found that his feet would shoot forward under the bottom of her, with the result that he sank back to the neck after each effort. When he had made two or three attempts he heard a shout: ...|$|E

Bangoura competed only in the men's 100 m breaststroke at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. He received a Universality place from FINA, in an entry time of 1:10.00. He challenged six other swimmers in heat two, including two-time Olympians Juan José Madrigal of Costa Rica and Jean Luc Razakarivony of Madagascar. Before {{the start of his}} heat, Bangoura immediately jumped into the pool first, and was disqualified for breaking a no false-start rule {{on the first day of}} preliminaries.|$|R
40|$|The Women’s Health Initiative Studies (WHI) were {{designed}} {{to examine the effects}} of estrogen and progestin (E+P; Prempro) and estrogen alone (Premarin) in post-menopausal women. The authors of the WHI studies and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) concluded that E+P treatment increased the risks of coronary heart disease, invasive <b>breast</b> cancer, <b>stroke</b> and venous thromboembolism. The following paper contains a reevaluation of these studies based on the graphic analysis of their tabulated data. In contrast to the conclusions reached by the WHI and the NHLBI, I conclude that treatment of post-menopausal women with estrogen and progestin (Prempro) does not increase the risks of cardiovascular disease, invasive <b>breast</b> cancer, <b>stroke</b> or venous thromboembolism. I also disagree with the claim that an increased risk of stroke existed in women treated with estrogen alone...|$|R

6000|$|Belike I had not lain long in that blessed {{land where}} trouble seldom comes when I was wakened, as it were, by a tugging at my clothes. I sat up, but {{the room was}} dark, save for a faint light in the casement, high overhead, and I thought I had dreamed. Howbeit, as I lay down again, heavy at heart, my clothes were again twitched, and now I remembered what I had heard, but never believed, {{concerning}} [...] "lutins" [...] or [...] "brownies," [...] as we call them, which, being spirits invisible, and reckoned to have no part in our salvation, are wont in certain houses to sport with men. Curious rather than affrighted, I sat up once more, and looked around, when I saw two bright spots {{of light in the}} dark. Then deeming that, for some reason unknown to me, the prison door had been opened while I slept, and a cat let in, I stretched out my hands towards the lights, thence came a sharp, faint cry, and something soft and furry leaped on to my <b>breast,</b> <b>stroking</b> me with little hands.|$|R

50|$|The Women's Health Initiative {{investigated}} {{the use of}} MPA and conjugated equine estrogens compared to placebo. The study was prematurely terminated when previously unexpected risks were discovered, specifically the finding that though the all-cause mortality was not affected by the hormone therapy, {{the benefits of the}} hormone replacement therapy (reduced risk of hip fracture, colorectal and endometrial cancer and all other causes of death) were offset by increased risk of coronary heart disease, <b>breast</b> cancer, <b>strokes</b> and pulmonary embolism. However, the study focused on MPA only and extrapolated the benefits versus risks to all synthetic progesterones—a conclusion that has been challenged by several researchers as unjustified and leading to unnecessary avoidance of HRT for many women as synthetic progesterones are not alike.|$|R
40|$|Appropriate {{and safe}} use of hormone {{replacement}} therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women is an evolving saga, triggered by the unexpected results from the first publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Trial in 2002. These results showed a slight but significantly increased risk of <b>breast</b> cancer, <b>stroke,</b> and dementia with standard HRT compared with placebo. A reanalysis of these results shows that use of HRT within {{the first few years}} after the onset of menopause may be associated with decreased risk of dementia and coronary artery disease. However, HRT in its commonly used form of conjugated equine estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate can increase seizure frequency in menopausal women with epilepsy; this outcome may be an adverse effect of these neuroactive steroids on the epileptic female brain, which is already in a hormonally deprived state. To explore this possibility, more information about the neurophysiologic activity of medroxyprogesterone acetate is needed and alternatives to this specific HRT regimen should be considered for women with epilepsy...|$|R
40|$|Non-auditory {{effects of}} noise on humans have been intensively {{studied in the}} last four decades. The International Commission on Biological Effects of Noise has been {{following}} scientific advances in this field by organizing international congresses from the first one in 1968 in Washington, DC, to the 11 th congress in Nara, Japan, in 2014. There is already a large scientific body of evidence on the effects of noise on annoyance, communication, performance and behavior, mental health, sleep, and cardiovascular functions including relationship with hypertension and ischemic heart disease. In the last five years new issues in this field have been tackled. Large epidemiological studies on community noise have reported its relationship with <b>breast</b> cancer, <b>stroke,</b> type 2 diabetes, and obesity. It seems that noise-induced sleep disturbance {{may be one of the}} mediating factors in these effects. Given a large public health importance of the above-mentioned diseases, future studies should more thoroughly address the mechanisms underlying the reported association with community noise exposure.
