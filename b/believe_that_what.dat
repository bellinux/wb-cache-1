This film {{is based on}} the premise that aliens monitoring the broadcast of an Earth-based TV series called Galaxy Quest, modeled heavily on Star Trek, <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> they are seeing is real. Many Star Trek actors have been quoted saying that Galaxy Quest was a brilliant parody.|$|E
25|$|For Eastern Orthodox Christians, fasting is an {{important}} spiritual discipline, found in both the Old Testament and the New, and {{is tied to the}} principle in Orthodox theology of the synergy between the body (Greek: soma) and the soul (pneuma). That is to say, Orthodox Christians do not see a dichotomy between the body and the soul but rather consider them as a united whole, and they <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> happens to one affects the other (this is known as the psychosomatic union between the body and the soul). Saint Gregory Palamas argued that man's body is not an enemy but a partner and collaborator with the soul. Christ, by taking a human body at the Incarnation, has made the flesh an inexhaustible source of sanctification. This same concept is also found in the much earlier homilies of Saint Macarius the Great.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{left for}} their US tour on 11 August 1966. According to Lennon's wife, Cynthia, {{he was nervous}} and upset {{that he had made}} people angry simply by expressing his opinion. The Beatles {{attended}} a press conference in Chicago, Illinois; Lennon did not want to apologise but was advised by Epstein and Barrow that he should. Lennon said that [...] "if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it" [...] but stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people viewed and popularised the band. He described his own belief in God by quoting the Bishop of Woolwich, saying, [...] "not as an old man in the sky. I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> people call God is something in all of us." [...] Adamant that he was not comparing himself with Christ, he tried to explain the decline of Christianity in the UK. Pressed for an apology by a reporter, he said: [...] "if you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then OK, I'm sorry." [...] Journalists gave a sympathetic response, and told Lennon that the Bible Belt were [...] "quite notorious for their Christian attitude".|$|E

2500|$|Generally, {{adherents of}} Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism {{believe that the}} {{individual}} Jew determines whether to follow Shabbat prohibitions or not. For example, some Jews might find activities, such as writing or cooking for leisure, to be enjoyable enhancements to Shabbat and its holiness, and therefore may encourage such practices. Many Reform Jews <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> constitutes [...] "work" [...] is different for each person, and that only what the person considers [...] "work" [...] is forbidden. The radical Reform rabbi Samuel Holdheim advocated moving Sabbath to Sunday for many no longer observed it, a step taken by dozens of congregations in the United States in late 19th century.|$|E

Although she bore little sympathy for Schoenberg and the Viennese dodecaphonicians, she was an ardent champion of Stravinsky".|$|E

2500|$|The {{defining}} {{belief of}} Unitarian Universalism is {{that religion is}} a matter of individual experience, and that, therefore, only the individual can decide what to [...] "believe." [...] The roots of this belief {{can be found in the}} Unitarian insistence on freedom of personal conscience in matters of faith. As a result, while Unitarian Universalists have no required creed; instead, they treat as a sacred value the complete and responsible freedom of speech, thought, belief, faith, and disposition. Unitarian Universalists believe that each person is free to search for their own personal truth on issues, such as the existence, nature, and meaning of life, deities, creation, and afterlife. UUs can come from any religious background, and hold beliefs and adhere to morals from a variety of cultures or religions. They <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> binds them together as a faith community is not a creed, but a belief in the power and sacredness of covenant based on unconditional love. That love is enough to hold together such variety derives from their Universalist heritage which affirms a God of all-inclusive love.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{opponents of}} Warren's view <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> matters morally {{is not that}} one be {{actually}} exhibiting complex mental qualities of the sort she identifies, but rather that one have in oneself a self-directed genetic propensity or natural capacity to develop such qualities. [...] In other words, what is crucial is that one {{be the kind of}} entity or substance that, under the right conditions, actively develops itself to the point of exhibiting Warren's qualities at some point in its life, even if it does not actually exhibit them because of not having developed them yet (embryo, infant) or having lost them (severe Alzheimer's). [...] Because human beings do have this natural capacity—and indeed have it essentially—therefore (on this view) they essentially have a right to life: they could not possibly fail to have a right to life. Further, since modern embryology shows that the embryo begins to exist at conception and has a natural capacity for complex mental qualities, therefore the right to life begins at conception.|$|E
2500|$|As David Mitchell says at {{the start}} of the programme, [...] "the rules are very simple". The panel is made up of four players. In the game each of the panellists is given a subject on which they give a short lecture. Most of the lecture is {{composed}} of lies, but during the course of the speech the lecturer must try to smuggle five true statements past the rest of the panel. The challenging panellists must buzz in when they <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> the lecturer is saying is true. They must state what they believe the fact was. If it was true, the challenger is awarded one point. If it was a lie, then they are deducted one point. One point is given to the lecturer for each truth they smuggle successfully without it being detected at the end of the lecture. The winner is the panellist with the most points. A perfect score is 20 points (by hiding all five of their truths, and spotting the five truths in all three of the other players' routines without making any wrong challenges), plus additional points for [...] "unintentional" [...] truths revealed during the monologue. However, nobody has reached this score yet, and in fact many contests have been amusingly low scoring, with most panellists having a negative number of points due to high number of guesses. On occasion, panellists have included more than five truths during in their talk, often unintentionally, although Jo Brand included an extra fact about Henry VIII as she thought it was so fantastic.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{schools on}} all {{education}} levels offer service-learning programs, which {{allow students to}} serve the community through volunteering while earning educational credit. According to Alexander Astin in the foreword to Where's the Learning in Service-Learning? by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, Jr.,"...we promote more wide-spread adoption of service-learning in higher education because {{we see it as}} a powerful means of preparing students to become more caring and responsible parents and citizens and of helping colleges and universities to make good on their pledge to 'serve society.'" [...] When describing service learning, the Medical Education at Harvard says, [...] "Service learning unites academic study and volunteer community service in mutually reinforcing ways. ...service learning is characterized by a relationship of partnership: the student learns from the service agency and from the community and, in return, gives energy, intelligence, commitment, time and skills to address human and community needs." [...] Volunteering in service learning seems to have the result of engaging both mind and heart, thus providing a more powerful learning experience; according to Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, it succeeds {{by the fact that it}} [...] "...fosters student development by capturing student interest..." [...] While not recognized by everyone as a legitimate approach, research on the efficacy of service learning has grown. Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles conducted a national study of American college students to ascertain the significance of service learning programs, According to Eyler and Giles,"These surveys, conducted before and after a semester of community service, examine the impact of service-learning on students." [...] They describe their experience with students involved in service-learning in this way: [...] "Students like service-learning. When we sit down with a group of students to discuss service-learning experiences, their enthusiasm is unmistakable. ...it is clear that <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> they gain from service-learning differs qualitatively from what they often derive from more traditional instruction." ...|$|E
