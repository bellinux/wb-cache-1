40|$|ABSTRACT:Pre {{and post}} {{emergence}} damping off in eggplant was 29 - 30 % in cv ABV- 1. The fungus Fusarium equiseti (Corda) Sacc. was highly pathogenic. Association of nematodeMeloidogyne incognita and fungus was synergistic. Lowest darning off was observed when Neem cake {{was added to}} soil followed by ambadi, cotton and safflower cake. Soil solarization and rabbing of soil was effective in reducing damping off. Trichoderma harzianum and Aspergillus niger exhibited antagonistic activity against the pathogen. Seed treatment with T. harzianum @ 10 g 1 kg seed + soil application of T. harzianum @ 20 g 1 pot showed minimum damping off. Seed treatment with captan or Thiram @ 3 gml kg was best in reducing damping off. Lowest damping off was observed in formaldehyde 5 % drenching. Integrated management of damping off was obtained with soil sterilization with 5 % formaldehyde drenching + seed treatment with thiram @ 3 gm Ikg seed + drenching of copper oxychloride @ 0. 3 %. Key words: Seed emergence, mortality, Solanum melongena Eggplant or brinjal (Solanum melongena L.) is an important vegetable crop grown in India. The seedlings are grown in nursery for transplanting in the field. The most important diseases in seedling stage are damping off caused by Fusarium spp., Pytaium spp., Rhizoctonia spp. and Phytophthora spp. (Zengin, 1978). In susceptible plant species seedling losses of 25 to 75 per cent can occur. The cost {{of some of the}} private <b>bred</b> <b>seed</b> is very high and hence this loss assumes economic importance to farmers. Investigations on etiology and management are reported in this paper. MATERIALS AND METHODS The losses due to damping off were assessed by growing measured number of seed (25) of eggplant cv. ABV. 1 in three pots filled with soil from nursery where damping off was a problem. Observations on pre and post emergence mortality were recorded. Serial isolations from the affected portion of damped off seedlings were made. Usual pathological laboratory procedure was followed. Soil from infected area, was collected and pathoge...|$|E

The simulation was spatially explicit, where agents were plant monocultures defined by three niche dimensions, lava (yes or no), elevation, and slope. Niches were represented as standard normal curves subjected to selection pressure, where neighboring plants bred if their niches overlapped sufficiently, and were considered the same species, otherwise they were different species. Plants that <b>bred</b> produced <b>seeds</b> with mutated niches. Seeds dispersed locally and longer distances, and established if the habitat was appropriate given the seed's niche.

40|$|Genes {{controlling}} {{hormone levels}} {{have been used}} to increase grain yields in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa). We created transgenic rice plants expressing maize (Zea mays), rice, or Arabidopsis thaliana genes encoding sterol C- 22 hydroxylases that control brassinosteroid (BR) hormone levels using a promoter that is active in only the stems, leaves, and roots. The transgenic plants produced more tillers and more seed than wild-type plants. The seed were heavier as well, especially the seed at the bases of the spikes that fill the least. These phenotypic changes brought about 15 to 44 % increases in grain yield per plant relative to wild-type plants in greenhouse and field trials. Expression of the Arabidopsis C- 22 hydroxylase in the embryos or endosperms themselves had no apparent effect on seed weight. These results suggested that BRs stimulate the flow of assimilate from the source to the sink. Microarray and photosynthesis analysis of transgenic plants revealed evidence of enhanced CO 2 assimilation, enlarged glucose pools in the flag leaves, and increased assimilation of glucose to starch in the seed. These results further suggested that BRs stimulate the flow of assimilate. Plants have not been <b>bred</b> directly for <b>seed</b> filling traits, suggesting that genes that control seed filling could be used to further increase grain yield in crop plants...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAvoidance {{mechanisms}} and intrinsic resistance are complementary strategies to improve winter frost tolerance and yield potential in field pea. The {{development of the}} winter pea crop represents a major challenge to expand plant protein production in temperate areas. Breeding winter cultivars requires the combination of freezing tolerance as well as high seed productivity and quality. In this context, we investigated the genetic determinism of winter frost tolerance and assessed its genetic relationship with yield and developmental traits. Using a newly identified source of frost resistance, we developed a population of recombinant inbred lines and evaluated it in six environments in Dijon and Clermont-Ferrand between 2005 and 2010. We developed a genetic map comprising 679 markers distributed over seven linkage groups and covering 947. 1  cM. One hundred sixty-one quantitative trait loci (QTL) explaining 9 - 71  % of the phenotypic variation were detected across the six environments for all traits measured. Two clusters of QTL mapped on the linkage groups III and one cluster on LGVI reveal the genetic links between phenology, morphology, yield-related traits and frost tolerance in winter pea. QTL clusters on LGIII highlighted major developmental gene loci (Hr and Le) and the QTL cluster on LGVI explained up to 71  % of the winter frost damage variation. This suggests that a specific architecture and flowering ideotype defines frost tolerance in winter pea. However, two consistent frost tolerance QTL on LGV were independent of phenology and morphology traits, showing that different protective mechanisms are involved in frost tolerance. Finally, {{these results suggest that}} frost tolerance can be <b>bred</b> independently to <b>seed</b> productivity and quality...|$|R
40|$|Most {{flowering}} plant seeds {{are composed of}} the embryo and endosperm surrounded by maternal tissue, in particular the seed coat. Whereas the embryo represents the dormant progeny, the endosperm is a terminal organ for storage of sugars and amino acids in proteins and carbohydrates, respectively. Produced in maternal leaves during photosynthesis, they are transported to developing seeds during flowering so that during germination they nourish early seedlings growth. Maize endosperm usually contains around 10 % protein and 70 % starch, and their composition ratio is rather stable, because it is strictly regulated through a pre-set genetic program, which is woven by networks of many interacting or counteracting genes and pathways. Protein, however, is lower in nutritional value mainly due to the high expression of the α-zein gene family encoding lysine-free proteins. Reduced levels {{of those in the}} opaque 2 (o 2) mutant and α-zein RNAi (RNA interference) transgenic seed is compensated by an increase of non-zein proteins, leading to the rebalancing of the nitrogen sink and therefore producing constant levels of total proteins in the seed. The same rebalancing of zeins and non-zeins has been observed for maize <b>seeds</b> <b>bred</b> for 30 % protein. In contrast to the nitrogen sink, storage of sulfur is controlled through the accumulation of specialized sulfur-rich proteins in maize endosperm. However, silencing the synthesis of α-zeins through RNAi fails to raise sulfur-rich proteins. Although overexpression of the methionine-rich δ-zein can increase the methionine level in seeds, it occurs at least in part {{at the expense of the}} cysteine-rich β- and γ-zeins, demonstrating a balance between cysteine and methionine in sulfur storage. Therefore, we propose that the throttle for the flow of sulfur is placed before the synthesis of sulfur amino acids when sulfur is taken up and reduced during photosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|Putative gamete-derived {{progenies}} {{from two}} Hylocereus species, the diploid H. monacanthus and the tetraploid H. megalanthus, were studied with the dual aims to confirm their gamete origin and {{to evaluate their}} potential use as genetic resources. An additional goal {{was to determine the}} origin (allotetraploid vs. autotetraploid) of H. megalanthus by exploring morphological variations in the di-haploid (2 x) H. megalanthus progeny. Gamete origin was proved in all five H. monacanthus lines obtained and in 49 of the 70 H. megalanthus lines by using flow cytometry and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The five double-haploid (2 x) H. monacanthus lines showed low vigor and abnormal flower development, with malformed ovules and aborted pollen grains. Only one flower set fruit, giving several viable seeds. For H. megalanthus, both abnormal ovules and defective anthers were observed in the di-haploid (2 x) and double di-haploid (4 x) lines. Among the 46 di-haploid lines, only 14 set fruit. Another 13 di-haploid lines formed flower buds that abscised before anthesis or soon after pollination. The severe sterility of the double-haploid H. monacanthus and the reduced fertility of all the di-haploid and double di-haploid H. megalanthus lines can be linked to their reduced heterozygosity, which drastically affected the development of normal female and male organs. We thus concluded that chromosome doubling, as occurred spontaneously in the double-haploid H. monacanthus and the double di-haploid H. megalanthus, is not sufficient to restore fertility in Hylocereus. We also observed very low gametoclonal variation among the di-haploid (2 x) H. megalanthus lines, a finding that supported an autotetraploid, rather than an allotetraploid, origin of this species. Nonetheless, despite the above-described challenging limitations, these gamete-derived lines are currently being <b>bred</b> as the <b>seed</b> parent, offering unique possibilities for genetic research and additional breeding...|$|R

The {{present study is}} related to three defatted hemp flour types addition, K 1 and K 2 gained from <b>seeds</b> <b>bred</b> conventionally, and K 3 in bio-planting regime. Wheat flour of good baking quality was provided by a Czech commercial mill. Besides the mixolab profiles, basic baking quality parameters were also determined. By analytical methods, protein content, Zeleny’s value and Falling Number were determined. Dough baking quality was tested {{with the help of}} three rheological apparatuses, namely farinograph, extensigraph and amylograph. Moreover, laboratory baking test was performed, and specific bread volume was calculated. Mixolab torque data was strongly affected by substitution level than hemp flour type. The most precise distinguishing of samples was observed during the mixing and starch retrogradation phases of the test. Correlation analysis confirmed proper relationships between mixolab and rheological parameters related both to protein properties (C 1, C 2, C 1 –C 2 vs. farinograph and extensigraph ones) and starch or starch gel properties (C 3, C 4, C 5 vs. amylograph ones). In the former case, the strongest relationship was found between C 1 and the dough development time (− 0. 80, p < 99 %), while in the latter between the amylase activity estimation (C 3 –C 4) and the amylograph viscosity maximum (− 0. 87, p < 99 %). Bread specific volume could be predicted by all five basic mixolab C’s. The best fitting correlation was found for C 3 readings (starch gelatinization rate, r = 0. 87, p < 99 %), while links of C 1 or C 2 (maximum torque as gluten strength and protein weakening) were softer (r = 0. 73 and 0. 70, respectively, p < 99 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Initial {{characterization}} of the flax genome showed that Ty 1 -copia retrotransposons are abundant, with several members being recently inserted, and in close association with genes. Recent insertions indicate a potential for ongoing transpositional activity that can create genomic diversity among accessions, cultivars or varieties. The polymorphisms generated constitute {{a good source of}} molecular markers that may be associated with phenotype if the insertions alter gene activity. Flax, where accessions are <b>bred</b> mainly for <b>seed</b> nutritional properties or for fibers, constitutes a good model for studying the relationship of transpositional activity with diversification and breeding. In this study, we estimated copy number and used a type of transposon display known as Sequence-Specific Amplification Polymorphisms (SSAPs), to characterize six families of Ty 1 -copia elements across 14 flax accessions. Polymorphic insertion sites were sequenced to find insertions that could potentially alter gene expression, and a preliminary test was performed with selected genes bearing transposable element (TE) insertions. Results: Quantification of six families of Ty 1 -copia elements indicated different abundances among TE families and between flax accessions, which suggested diverse transpositional histories. SSAPs showed a high level of polymorphism in most of the evaluated retrotransposon families, with a trend towards higher levels of polymorphism in low-copy number families. Ty 1 -copia insertion polymorphisms among cultivars allowed a general distinction between oil and fiber types, and between spring and winter types, demonstrating their utility in diversity studies. Characterization of polymorphic insertions revealed an overwhelming association with genes, with insertions disrupting exons, introns or within 1 kb of coding regions. A preliminary test on the potential transcriptional disruption by TEs of four selected genes evaluated in three different tissues, showed one case of significant impact of the insertion on gene expression. Conclusions: We demonstrated that specific Ty 1 -copia families have been active since breeding commenced in flax. The retrotransposon-derived polymorphism can be used to separate flax types, and the close association of many insertions with genes defines a good source of potential mutations that could be associated with phenotypic changes, resulting in diversification processes...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Organic {{agriculture}} {{is an important}} and growing sector of U. S. and world food production. Consumers are increasingly aware of and interested in the production practices and impacts associated with agriculture and as such, are showing a preference for sustainably produced, raised, and harvested foods. In order to continue to meet the growing demand for organic produce, organic growers need cultivars that are optimally adapted to organic and low input conditions. Quality seed {{is the foundation of}} any functional and stable farming system. Unfortunately the lack of organically <b>bred</b> and produced <b>seed</b> is hindering the continued growth and success of organic farming. Meeting the needs of the organic sector has been a challenge for the seed industry; it is an industry that often doesn't understand the specific and unique requirements associated with the diversity of environmental and market demands of organic systems. However, organic farmers and the organic food systems they supply, require a robust organic seed system that is appropriately adapted to regional agronomic challenges and market needs, meets standards and regulations, and encompasses the social and ecological values of organic agriculture. One plausible approach to meeting the cultivar and seed needs of organic and low input production systems is through the use of participatory plant breeding (PPB). PPB is a collaborative approach for identifying and developing genetically diverse plant material and varieties involving partnerships among formal sector breeders and researchers, farmers, extension agents, educators, and end users. Participatory plant breeding fundamentally changes the way that formal breeding programs and farmers manage germplasm and plant genetic resources. Typically, formal breeding programs restrict access to germplasm and breeding materials and only supply farmers with finished varieties. In PPB, farmers are involved {{in the early stages of}} creation and evaluation of germplasm and breeding material, and stay engaged with the breeding process until new varieties are created. PPB is an excellent model for breeding specifically for organic systems because organic systems in developed countries have many similarities to low-input agricultural systems in the developing world. Some of these parallels include heterogeneous growing environments, a wide range of end uses and marketing strategies, lack of suitably adapted and/or derived varieties, lack of attention from the formal seed sector, and a reduced reliance on synthetic inputs (compared to conventional systems). Breeding for organic systems is a relatively young field and breeders in the formal sector do not have a good handle on what traits are important for robust production under organic conditions. Thus the opportunity to meld farmers' experience and knowledge with breeders' expertise is an effective way to breed for organic production systems. The purpose of this project was to investigate and explore the opportunities and challenges of organic plant breeding using participatory research methods. This research had three goals: 1) to develop an open pollinated broccoli with contemporary quality traits for organic production systems using participatory strategies; 2) to compare broccoli selections made by formally trained plant breeders and farmer breeders; and 3) to capture the stories and experiences of the formal breeders and farmer breeders involved with this broccoli material in order to contribute to the growing wealth of knowledge on collaborative and organic breeding work. The Oregon State University Vegetable Breeding Program made significant progress towards decreasing the variability of the broccoli project material through three successive years of modified half-sibling selections. Evaluations and selections were based more strongly on quality traits rather than soley on production traits such as yield. Although progress was incremental and statistically verified in only three out of the fifteen quality traits, we observed trends in the data indicating progress towards an increasingly uniform, stable, and reliable open pollinated broccoli with specific adaptation for organic production systems. There were very few differences between broccoli materials developed by formally trained plant breeders and farmer breeders. This was especially true for the three cultivars developed in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) (one in Washington and two in Oregon). The 'East Coast' population, which had been collaboratively selected by formal and farmer breeders in New York, expressed significantly distinct differences from the PNW materials. When the farmer breeder and formal breeder materials were pooled together and compared to pooled check cultivars they expressed significant differences for nearly all traits across all years. This demonstrated that all of the collaboratively developed open pollinated materials are distinctly different from the F 1 hybrids currently available. Our work has demonstrated a few of the myriad of positive outcomes achievable with the use of participatory plant breeding for organic production systems. The participatory nature of this project resulted in increased confidence and feelings of empowerment for all involved. Both farmers and breeders felt their involvement was socially beneficial and widened their networking and seed community circles. The farmer-bred cultivar 'Solstice' is now available as a result of Jonathan Spero's work, and a cultivar tentatively named 'Benton' is about to be released for sale through Oregon State University. Our results agree with previous study findings that formal and farmer breeder selections are often not distinctly different; thus providing evidence for continuing to support the involvement and education of farmers in plant breeding, especially in reference to organic production systems. This study demonstrates the potential of collaboratively developed and farmer-bred cultivars to become viable and vibrant open pollinated alternatives to the current open pollinated cultivars on the market today...|$|R
