50|$|Portable mills {{have also}} been used in {{conjunction}} with salvage logging operations. In salvage logging, logs that were lost underwater during nineteenth-century river-borne log drives are recovered by divers. These logs are often worth many thousands of dollars. The thin kerf blade of the portable sawmill allows for much higher <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> yields from these valuable logs.|$|E
50|$|The wider arm, {{two inches}} wide, {{is called the}} blade; the {{narrower}} arm, {{one and a half}} inches wide, the tongue. The square has many uses, including laying out common rafters, hip rafters and stairs. It has a diagonal scale, <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> scale and an octagonal scale. On the newer framing squares there are degree conversions for different pitches and fractional equivalents.|$|E
50|$|The rated {{capacity}} of the new sawmill was 50,000,000 <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> per year. By comparison, the Wisconsin-Michigan Lumber Co. milled about 15,000,000 <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> per year.|$|R
50|$|The {{nation has}} a notable {{forestry}} resource and ably manages a timber program. In an 1870 {{assessment of their}} lands, which totaled roughly 235000 acre, they counted 1.3 billion standing <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of timber. Today that has increased to 1.7 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet.</b> In the intervening years, they have harvested more than 2.25 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The spruce beetle {{is one of}} many beetle {{species that}} have {{recently}} increased their breeding times. The overpopulation of beetles in some forests in Kenai, Alaska, have damaged several spruce species that are no longer able to dwell there. The spruce beetle destroyed 2300000 acre (2 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet)</b> of spruce forests in Alaska from 1992 to 1999 (about 30 million trees per year at the peak), and 122000 acre of Utah forests in the 1990s (more than 3 million trees). Outbreaks from 1975-2000 were seen in Montana (loss of 25 million <b>board</b> <b>feet),</b> Idaho (loss of 31 million <b>board</b> <b>feet),</b> Arizona (loss of over 100 million <b>board</b> <b>feet),</b> and British Columbia (loss of 3 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet).</b> As of 2000 the beetle was responsible for the loss of about 400 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> annually. [...] D. rufipennis is also a part of the ecosystem in Colorado.|$|R
5000|$|A {{measure of}} 100 varas by 100 varas (Spanish) is almost 7000 square meters, {{and is known}} {{traditionally}} throughout Latin America as a manzana (i.e., a [...] "city block"). As well, lumber is still measured in Costa Rica using a system based on 4 vara, or 11 feet, for both round and square wood. With square wood, using inches, the width is multiplied by the depth to get a measurement which they call pulgadas, or inches. The lumber is charged 'per inch', which is a measurement 11/12 of a <b>board</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|E
50|$|Koa is a commodity, a {{dominant}} native forest species, {{and an important}} element of Hawaiian culture. Koa is highly-prized hardwood that can sell for prices as high as $150 a <b>board</b> <b>foot,</b> a special measurement indicating one-foot by one-foot by one-inch wood piece. Koa is currently being grown on plantations to support this high demand, yet some plantations have a 90% tree mortality rate over several years due to Koa wilt. It is also a legume, giving it the ability to form symbiosis with nitrogen fixing bacteria, which has led to efforts to use koa in agroecological systems with crops such as coffee and cacao.|$|E

50|$|The {{portable}} {{chain saw}} and other technological developments helped drive more efficient logging, but {{the proliferation of}} other building materials {{in the twentieth century}} saw the end of the rapidly rising demand of the previous century. In 1950, the United States produced 38 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of lumber, and that number remained fairly constant throughout the decades moving forward, with the national production at 32.9 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> in 1960 and 34.7 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> in 1970.|$|R
50|$|The Tongass Timber Act helped {{establish}} The Ketchikan Pulp Company, {{followed by the}} Sitka Pulp Mill. The timber to support these mills increased harvest in the Tongass National Forest from 70 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> in 1954 to 405 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> in 1965.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{factor that}} damaged {{wetlands}} was large scale logging, particularly the extensive logging of cypress {{forests in the}} early 1900s. [...] One early logger described it this way: [...] "We just use the old method of going in and cutting down the swamp and tearing it up and bringing the cypress out. When a man's in here with all the heavy equipment, {{he might as well}} cut everything he can make a <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> out of; we're not ever coming back in here again" [...] This logging often required construction of canals, which, once the logging was finished, allowed salt water to enter the wetlands and prevent regeneration of the cypress.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Board</b> <b>foot</b> is {{the unit}} of measure for rough lumber (before drying and planing with no adjustments) or planed/surfaced lumber. An example of planed lumber is {{softwood}} 2 × 4 lumber one would buy at a large lumber retailer. The 2 × 4 is actually only 1+1/2 × 3+1/2 in but the dimensions for the lumber when purchased wholesale could still be represented as full 2 × 4 lumber, although the [...] "standard" [...] can vary between vendors. This means that nominal lumber includes air space around the physical board when calculating board feet in some situations, while the true measurement of [...] "board feet" [...] {{should be limited to}} the actual dimensions of the board.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was a major}} {{undertaking}} to move {{millions of}} tons of rock to the two barrier islands {{at the entrance to the}} harbor and build [...] "jetties" [...] of over 11,000 feet on the north and 21, 000 feet on the south entrance of the bay, with steam and sail power. A dredge was built to maintain a channel and, coupled with the railway and the river system, the lumber business flourished. Mills sprang up almost overnight. The Atlantic Coast Lumber Company was the largest in the world with its 5,000,000 <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> (12,000 m³) dock and shed. Turpentine, pine rosin, shingles, furniture - but none as unusual as the DuPont wood alcohol and dynamite mill.|$|E
50|$|Class 1: {{producers}} {{are defined by}} rule as those paying the harvest tax on 20 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> per year or less. Class 2: {{producers are}} those paying tax on more than 20 million per year but less than 100 million <b>board</b> <b>feet.</b> Class 3: producers pay tax on 100 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> per year or more.Small woodland owners: are defined as those who own between 100 and 2,000 acres of forestland and who have no direct financial interest in any forest products processing activity.|$|R
50|$|By 1887 Elgin had general stores, a livery, a hotel, and a church, {{as well as}} {{a nearby}} sawmill, which {{continues}} as a more modern Boise Cascade mill. Between 1887 and 1908, the area around Elgin had 35 sawmills, most transportable water-driven whipsaws (vertical reciprocating saws). Local landowners would sell the trees for 50 centers per thousand <b>board</b> <b>feet,</b> which is about how much the sawmills could handle in a day. Log transportation cost about two dollars per thousand <b>board</b> <b>feet,</b> and a mill could sell the processed lumber for $6-10 per thousand <b>board</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are about 35 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of timber. About 1.5 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> are harvested every year. This {{is an example of}} sustainable forest management of renewable resources. Using this method is an attempt to ensure that the pine forest habitat is not degraded by overexploitation.|$|R
50|$|This fungus is {{normally}} found on dead conifers, {{but can also}} be observed growing on large stem wounds, broken tops, and dead tissue of live trees. In mature forests, these stem decay fungi cause enormous annual wood volume loss of Alaska’s major tree species. Approximately one-third of the old-growth timber <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> volume in Southeast Alaska is defective, largely due to decay from this type of fungus. Conversely, {{there is very little}} decay in young-growth stands unless there is prevalent wounding from commercial thinning activities, wind damage, or animal feeding. By predisposing large old trees to bole breakage and windthrow, stem decays serve as important small-scale disturbance regimes in these temperate rainforest ecosystems where fire and other large-scale disturbances are uncommon.|$|E
40|$|Dwarf {{mistletoe}} {{is known}} to reduce both height and diameter growth and thus reduce the yield of an infested stand. This comparison of two similar stands [...] one healthy and the other infested [...] gives {{an indication of the}} impact of this parasite. The healthy stand has produced 1. 5 times the <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> volume in one-half the time. By predicting the volume of the healthy stand at age 120 (the age of the infested stand), the healthy stand will produce 3. 7 times the <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> volume of the infested stand...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of well-stocked second-growth coastal redwood stands to {{three levels of}} commercial thinning is reported after 29 years of growth. Commercial thinning treatments left 25 percent, 50 percent, 75 percent and 100 percent (uncut control) of the original basal area (400 ft 2 per acre) in a 40 -year old stand on the Jackson Demonstration State Forest. Stand values are given for basal area, number of trees, average diameter, and cubic foot volume and <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> volume per acre for the pre-treatment stand and five post-treatment inventory dates from 1970 to 1999. There were {{significant differences between the}} treatments in basal area, average diameter, and volume throughout the course of the study. Analysis of the periodic growth rate revealed strong statistical differences between the treatments in diameter growth but no significant differences in the basal area or volume growth (cubic and <b>board</b> <b>foot).</b> Total <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> volume was not statistically different between thinning treatments due to high variation but there is a trend indicating that the 25 percent retention treatment produced a lower yield than the other two treatments and the uncut control. Though this was not a regeneration harvest, regeneration was measured for inference to partial harvest management. The {{response of}} the understory regeneration was strongly affected by the density of the overstory canopy. A precommercial thinning study of the redwood sprouts showed a response only in the 25 percent overstory retention treatment...|$|E

40|$|New {{methods of}} scaling logs by weight are {{becoming}} more prevalent in the Ozark forests of Missouri. In 2009, a major weather event known as a derecho downed millions of board feet of timber in Missouri and the ensuing salvage harvest following the event necessitated {{the need for a}} faster method of scaling logs at area sawmills. It is now common in Missouri for sawmills to assume that a green <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> (bf) of oak (Quercus spp.) will weigh approximately 12 pounds (lbs.). Four species groups were selected for harvest; white oak (Quercus alba), black oak (Quercus velutina), post oak (Quercus stellata), and hickories (Carya spp.) which were not separated into specific species. Of these species groups, 220 trees were selected for harvest and felled following the collection of the diameter (in.), total height (ft.), and crown height (ft.). The total weight of the trees were collected prior to bucking and followed with the collection of the weight of the merchantable portion of the stem alone, without the tree top, and the weights of any sawlogs bucked from the merchantable stem. The data collected were used to produce averages of weight per <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> that are species specific to some of Missouri's oaks species and hickories and that will allow for better estimation of board feet volume at the sawmill...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Thermal {{insulation}} with thermal resistivities of {{at least}} 20 (h ft 2 F/ Btu in.) {{have been shown to}} have the potential for significant energy conservation if employed in residential and commercial refrigerator/freezers Many materials and systems have been proposed which may be incorporated into refrigerator/freezers to achieve this potential. The current state of the art for advanced evacuated insulations which may achieve resistivities of 20 was established by reviewing data on many materials available in the open literature on the dependence of the thermal performance on internal pressure. The costs for the powdered, fiber, foam and multilayer materials were then obtained from the manufacturer of the products Possible candidate materials for m-clusion into refrigerator/freezers are described and ranked based upon their thermal properties and costs. Several materials were found that may be used to make super-insulation panels with material costs of less than $ 1. 00 per <b>board</b> <b>foot,</b> if a plastic laminate is used for the container required to maintain the necessary vacuum. Materials falling in this category included. Beverly silica dust, open-cell polyurethane foam, fine perlite, 2. 7 lb/ft 3 fiberglass and 3. 6 lb/ft 3 fiberglass opacified with vapor-deposited alu-minum, precipitated silica, and mixtures of precipitated silica and fly ash.

40|$|Vertical point {{sampling}} has seen relatively little use in practical forestry, {{in part because}} existing field techniques are difficult. We show how vertical {{point sampling}} can be implemented quickly and easily using a camera. We give tables and equations for calculating the height-squared factor, which plays a role {{similar to that of}} the basal area factor in horizontal point sampling. Some suggestions for choosing a height-squared factor are discussed, along with potential applications for further exploration. We illustrate the technique using a case study in southern Maine. Direct estimates with no statistically detectable bias were obtained using height-squared factors greater than 3. The results also suggested that the technique could be used as a correlate in double sampling for variables such as cubic volume, stand density index, and biomass, and possibly <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> volume as well...|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} {{industrial}} development in Minneapolis was tied to St. Anthony Falls and the power it provided. Between 1848 and 1887, Minneapolis {{led the nation in}} sawmilling. In 1856, the mills produced 12 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> (28,000 m³) of lumber. That total had risen to about 91,000,000 <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> (215,000 m³) in 1869, and 960,000,000 <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> (2,270,000 m³) in 1899. During the peak of this activity, at least 13 sawmills were operating on the falls. The sawmills also supported related industries such as mills that planed and smoothed the lumber; factories that built sashes, doors, and windows; and manufacturers of shingles and wooden buckets.|$|R

Total production of lumber fell at a devastating rate, from 35 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> in 1920 to 10 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> in 1932. Moreover, the steady decline of gross income, net profits, and increased consumption of cement and steel products, exacerbated the decline of lumber production.|$|R
40|$|There are {{at least}} seven basic ways to place a dollar value on plant material. No one way is ideal for all cases. Some of the methods {{used in the past}} are being changed or have been changed within the last year.

40|$|The {{process of}} drying lumber is {{essentially}} evaporating water from wood. Where {{does all the}} energy go? In any type of drying. whether it be air drying or kiln drying, the single biggest consumption of energy is the evaporation {{of water from the}} wood's surface. For every pound of water evaporated (approximately 1 liquid pint). about 970 BTU's of heat energy is required. If this drying is done in an air-yard, the energy doesn't cost a cent, but we can assign a value to it. Say 73, 000 BF of Ponderosa pine is to be air-dried and 1 - 1 / 2 pounds of water are removed from each <b>board</b> <b>foot.</b> This is a total of 109, 500 pounds of water (13, 600 gallons) which will require a total of 106, 220, 000 BTU's to evaporate it {{from the surface of the}} wood. Nature gives us this energy free, but if we were to purchase this same amount of energy in the form of fuel, costs would be as follows...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Multiple {{regressions}} were formulated with {{predictor variables}} of latitude, longitude, and elevation, stand stocking, age, and site index for western Oregon, western Washington, and southwest British Columbia. Models were assessed for normality using plots of studentized residuals by fitted values, q-q plots, and fit {{was assessed by}} R 2 value. Outliers were examined based upon Bonferroni p-values and Cook's distance. The developed seven multiple regression models were for response variables of cubic foot volume including top, cubic foot volume to top 4 and 6 inches in diameter, and Scribner <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> volume to top 4 and 6 inches in diameter. These models were {{used to examine the}} effects of early density controls and the effects of subsequent heavy first thinnings on volume yield. The assessment concluded that early density controls resulted in highest to lowest productivity in the order of 100 initial Trees Per Acre (TPA), 300 TPA, 500 TPA, and 700 TPA. In assessing effects from a first thin, the 300 TPA class was shown to have the most increased volume. The first thinning in the 500 and 700 TPA levels showed an overall minimal increase in volume and diameter size due to a longer delay in allocating growth from the crown to the stem. The models produced in this study can be of use in assessing and understanding predictions made by other regional growth models...|$|E
