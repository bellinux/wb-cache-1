5|$|As seas {{surrounding}} Banton can {{be rough}} during the wet season, the <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> visit {{the island is}} from March to May during the dry (summer) season. This is also the typical time for Asi families living in Metro Manila or abroad to visit the island since it coincides with the Lenten season and barangay fiestas. Within the island, the main forms of transportation are passenger motorcycles (known elsewhere as habal-habal) and motorized boats. A circumferential road connects the 17 barangays of Banton to each other.|$|E
5|$|English astrology {{had reached}} its zenith by the 17th century. Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, {{as well as}} {{providing}} individual advice to everyone from monarchs downwards. Among other things, astrologers could advise on the <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything—people, the world, the universe—was understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with religion, magic and science.|$|E

5|$|Wilson is also {{recognized}} {{for being a}} political pioneer in techniques for determining public opinion while he held office. In the 20th century, the straw poll and scientific public opinion polls by companies including Gallup became standard parts of political campaigns and media coverage of elections. During his Senate career, Wilson pioneered straw polling by sampling the views of Massachusetts voters through in person conversations and unscientific written surveys before making his own views known. These efforts were credited with helping Wilson build coalitions, win elections, make political allies, and determine the <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> act in the Senate on issues of importance.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} folk tales about the Sumatran rhino were {{collected}} by colonial naturalists and hunters from the mid-19th century to early 20th century. In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that the <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, {{it was said that}} the rhino's horn was hollow and {{could be used as a}} sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was not an}} {{especially}} pious king by medieval standards. In England, he provided steady patronage to the monastic houses, but established few new monasteries and was relatively conservative in determining which he did support, favouring those with established links to his family, such as Reading Abbey. In this regard Henry's religious tastes {{appear to have been}} influenced by his mother, and indeed before his ascension a number of religious charters were issued in their joint names. Henry did found a number of religious hospitals in England and France. After the death of Becket, Henry built and endowed various monasteries in France, primarily to improve his popular image. Since travel by sea during the period was dangerous, he would also take full confession before setting sail and use auguries to determine the <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> travel. Henry's movements may also have been planned to take advantage of saints' days and other fortuitous occasions.|$|E
50|$|There are controversies {{about the}} <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> test, {{and the best}} test method to use. There are {{national}} and international approaches to standardize these. In childhood leukaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia, {{there appears to be}} consensus emerging.|$|R

25|$|The {{evolution}} {{towards the}} net/node addressing scheme was also useful for reducing communications costs between continents, where timezone differences on {{either end of}} the connection might also come into play.

Efforts towards introducing a continental level to the addressing system started in 1986.|$|E
