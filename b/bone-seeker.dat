5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to eat or smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a <b>bone-seeker</b> like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E
40|$|These {{retrospective}} study is aimed {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of therapy with Stronthium-chloride 89 (89 SrCl) and Samarium 153 conjugated with ethylenediaminetetramethylene phosphonic acid (153 Sm–EDTMP) in the palliation of bone pain due to metastatic malignancy. The study refers to a presentation sample of 27 patients with bone metastases caused by different cancers (16 prostate, 5 breast, 6 lung) who were enrolled and followed-up for 11. 5 ± 6. 3 months. 89 SrCl (150 MBq) was administered in 17 pts, 153 Sm–EDTMP (37 MBq/Kg) in 10 pts. All patients showed multiple metastatic sites of 99 Tc-HDP uptake documented by a standard bone scintigraphy. Effectiveness of treatment was evaluated by questionnaires about pain and quality of life, Karnofsky index, specific cancer markers, a post-treatment bone scintigraphy. Presence of flare reaction and haematological toxicity were evaluated too. Questionnaire scores decreased both in patients treated with 89 SrCl and in those given 153 Sm–EDTM, without significant difference. Karnofsky index significantly increased only in patients with prostate cancer. After therapy, {{there were no significant}} changes of tumor marker levels, neither in bone scintigraphic pattern. Flare reaction occurred in 44 % of the cases within 2 weeks from the therapy. Remarkable variations of platelets and leukocytes occurred in 33. 3 % and 18. 5 % of patients, respectively, independently of the radiopharmaceutical used, but reversed within 6 weeks after therapy. Conclusions. Radionuclide therapy with <b>bone-seeker</b> agents 89 Sr and 153 Sm in the palliation of painful bone metastases allows a partial/total relief of pain with an improvement of quality of life. No tumoricid effect was found. Haematological toxicity was limited and reversible. Patients with prostate cancer seem to have a higher response rate...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. -Human {{experience}} of the toxicity of radium acts {{as a guide for}} the setting of occupationally permissible levels for radioactive nucleides, especially <b>bone-seekers.</b> Reviewing the published statements and photomicrographs in early reports especially those of Martland (1931) one can make a case that malignancy was induced in bone-marrow (leukaemia, malignant myelosclerosis) as well as in bone (osteosarcoma) by radium, especially with large doses. Three case reports of radium intoxication in Britons are noted as compatible with this suggestion, after revised interpretation in two of them. RADIUM POISONING WE still rely very heavily on rather inadequate human {{experience of}} the radiotoxicity of radium for regulating occupational exposure of man to internal contamination with radioactive substances. The first report on radium poisoning is attributed to a dentist (Blum, 1924) who, in a discussion on osteomyelitis of the jaws, drew attention to a condition of " radium jaw " he had seen in luminizers, young women who painted dial...|$|R
