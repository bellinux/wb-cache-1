Jones was a longtime programmer who was porting a game he wrote, called Minotaur, from an Apple II to the Apple Macintosh platform. Jones recalled, [...] "I didn't really know [...] in the class.

[...] Seropian and Jones partnered to release the role-playing video game as [...] in 1992; while Jones finished the coding, Seropian handled design and publicity. The game relied on then-uncommon internet modems and AppleTalk connections for play and sold around 2,500 copies, but it developed a devoted following.|$|E

In 1979, a blunt {{newspaper}} article from the Knight News Service referenced {{this period of}} her life, saying of her acting career that [...] "it {{looked as if she}} blew it." [...] The article referred to Hershey as a [...] "kook" [...] and stated that she was frequently [...] "high on something." [...] In addition to that criticism, she had been ostracized for breast-feeding her son during an appearance on The Dick Cavett Show, and for breast-feeding him beyond the age of two years. She said that this period of her life hurt her career; [...] "Producers wouldn't see me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> reputation for using drugs and being undependable. I never used drugs at all and I have always been serious about my acting career." [...] After splitting up with Carradine, she changed her stage name back to [...] "Hershey", explaining that she had told the story of why she adopted the name [...] "Seagull" [...] so many times that it had lost its meaning.|$|E

500|$|As {{the police}} claimed {{that there were}} no {{surviving}} papers in the case, and the senior investigating officers had since died, Chand relied largely upon newspaper cuttings to piece together what had happened. Chand, who acted pro bono for Hodgson, said of his investigation: [...] "The search was the most difficult thing I have encountered in my personal and professional life. It was like finding a needle in a haystack. I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy but I was not prepared to accept this, as instinct told me that the samples would be somewhere. I persevered <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> gut feeling that something was wrong." [...] Eventually, Chand's probing led to the rediscovery of an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands [...] "which they appeared to have forgotten about". Stored here were all of the swabs taken by the pathologist in December 1979. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) notified Julian Young of the initial results of the DNA analysis, and on 30January 2009 it was confirmed that the semen detected on the vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from Hodgson.|$|E
500|$|Portrayed by Yvonne Craig, the character's first {{adaptation}} {{outside of}} comic books {{took place in}} the third season of Batman (1967), Barbara Gordon having been discussed months earlier by her father and Batman in the second season episodes, [...] "Batman's Waterloo" [...] and [...] "The Duo Defy". Les Daniels, in Batman: The Complete History (2004) wrote that the goal of ABC was to [...] "attract new audience members, especially idealistic young girls and less high-minded older men." [...] According to Craig: [...] "I used to think the reason they hired me was because they knew I could ride my own motorcycle... I realized they hired me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> cartoon voice." [...] A shared criticism of Batgirl and other female superheroes in television that came later (such as Wonder Woman and the Bionic Woman), is that she was not allowed to engage in hand-to-hand combat on screen. As such, [...] "her fights were choreographed carefully to imitate the moves of a Broadway showgirl {{through the use of a}} straight kick to her opponent's face rather than the type of kick a martial artist would use." [...] However, Craig has also stated: [...] "I meet young women who say Batgirl was their role model... They say it's because it was the first time they ever felt girls could do the same things guys could do, and sometimes better. I think that’s lovely." [...] During the early 1970s, Craig portrayed Batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate equal pay for women.|$|E

Since Batman, the character has had a long history of appearances in television and other media. As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon plays a supporting role in a string of animated series, voiced by Jane Webb in The Batman/Superman Hour (1968), Melendy Britt in The New Adventures of Batman (1977), Melissa Gilbert in [...] (1992), Tara Strong in The New Batman Adventures (1997) and Beware the Batman (2013), Danielle Judovits in The Batman (2004), Mae Whitman in [...] (2008) and Alyson Stoner in Young Justice (2011). The Batman series also showcased the character's first animated adaptation as Oracle, voiced by Kellie Martin in the episode [...] "Artifacts" [...] (2007). She also appears in DC Super Hero Girls voiced by Mae Whitman in season 1 as Barbara Gordon and season 2 as Batgirl. Other variations of the character that have been adapted into other media include an elderly Barbara Gordon, voiced by Stockard Channing and Angie Harmon in 1999's Batman Beyond, who after retiring as Batgirl, became commissioner of the Gotham City police department.|$|E

Tench was recommended to Morrison by drummer Peter Van Hooke, after Hooke had seen him perform with Streetwalkers. In an interview with Johnny Rogan Tench stated: [...] "I quite liked the songs [...] "Natalia" [...] and [...] "Wavelength" [...] <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{lot to do with}} them. They came together quickly. He's a very quick worker and once it's there he doesn't see why you can't record it. He let us get on with it, really. It was a good band". He was credited with production assistance, guitar, and backing vocals on this album, which became Morrison's best selling album at that time. He also contributed lead guitar and vocals to the promotional Wavelength tour which followed. The tour started in Santa Clara, California on 30 September 1978 and ended on 1 March 1979 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. By the end of the tour he had appeared in Morrison's lineup sixty two times.|$|E

The Marshall Mathers LP {{was released}} with two different album covers. The original features Eminem {{sitting on the porch}} of the house he lived in during his teenage years. He reflected on the photo shoot by saying, [...] "I had mixed feelings <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of good and bad memories in that house. But to go back to where I grew up and finally say, 'I've made it', is the greatest feeling in the world to me. [...] " [...] The other cover features the rapper seated in a fetal position beneath a loading dock with alcohol and prescription pill bottles at his feet. Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly likened Eminem's appearance on the cover to a [...] "dysfunctional Little Rascal", viewing the image as indicative of the rapper's musical evolution: [...] "Easy to read, right?

2500|$|Callas herself {{appears to}} have been in {{agreement}} not only with Ardoin's assertions that she started as a natural mezzo-soprano, but also saw the similarities between herself and Pasta and Malibran. In 1957, she described her early voice as: [...] "The timbre was dark, almost black—when I think of it, I think of thick molasses", and in 1968 she added, [...] "They say I was not a true soprano, I was rather toward a mezzo". Regarding her ability to sing the heaviest as well as the lightest roles, she told James Fleetwood, It's study; it's Nature. I'm doing nothing special, you know. Even Lucia, Anna Bolena, Puritani, all these operas were created for one type of soprano, the type that sang Norma, Fidelio, which was Malibran of course. And a funny coincidence last year, I was singing Anna Bolena and Sonnambula, same months and the same distance of time as Giuditta Pasta had sung in the nineteenth century... So I'm really not doing anything extraordinary. You wouldn't ask a pianist [...] {{to be able to play}} everything; he [...] to. This is Nature and also <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> wonderful teacher, the old kind of teaching methods... I was a very heavy voice, that is my nature, a dark voice shall we call it, and I was always kept on the light side. She always trained me to keep my voice limber.|$|E
2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, last night I went to bed early and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I thought {{you were in the}} room...I was very unhappy <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> row with my mother and very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I felt quite light, as though I was falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and my boots are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is {{at the back of my}} mind all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed". Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall work so hard , partly to please you and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to write well, don't you? And I do hate writing badly-and having written so badly in the past. But now, like Queen Victoria, I will be good".|$|E
