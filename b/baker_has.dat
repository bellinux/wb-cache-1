5|$|A {{self-described}} anarchist, <b>Baker</b> <b>has</b> been {{categorized as}} a writer of transgressional fiction, in that his novels are frequently populated by sociopathic, nihilistic characters who engage in taboo behaviors such as heavy drug use, incest, necrophilia and other practices; and often commit acts of extreme, surrealistic violence. A man of eclectic tastes, Baker cited as literary influences writers and film directors ranging from Proust to Jim Thompson and Sam Peckinpah. He also admired the punk writer Dennis Cooper.|$|E

5|$|<b>Baker</b> <b>has</b> {{been married}} three times; she first married Louie Ritter in 1953, but the {{marriage}} ended within a year, after which she {{enrolled at the}} Actors Studio in New York City.

Her second was to director Jack Garfein, a Holocaust survivor she met at the Studio and for whom she converted to Judaism (having been raised a Catholic). They had one daughter, Blanche Baker (born 1956), also an actress; and a son, Herschel Garfein (born 1958), who is a composer and faculty member at the Steinhardt School of Music at New York University.

5|$|Pattle was {{provisionally}} {{credited with}} 50 air victories (and two shared), seven (and one shared) probable victories, and four (and two shared) damaged. It {{is likely that}} his total was at least 40 enemy aircraft destroyed a figure which biographer Edgar <b>Baker</b> <b>has</b> compiled through a list of semi-official records and log-books. Baker asserts that the true figure could be higher, owing to the inability of post-war researchers to identify an exact figure, due to the loss or destruction of British records in the retreat from Greece or during the subsequent occupation.|$|E
5|$|She has, however, {{sometimes}} {{participated in}} retrospective documentaries, including {{an interview for}} the 2006 DVD release of Baby Doll, which includes a documentary featuring Baker reflecting on the film's impact on her career. <b>Baker</b> <b>has</b> also been featured in documentaries about several of her co-stars, including Clark Gable, Roger Moore, Sal Mineo, and James Dean, including the 1975 James Dean: The First American Teenager, and a 1985 BBC Radio 2 tribute marking the 30th anniversary of the actor's death. Her memories of James Dean at the Actors Studio and later in Giant were recalled on BBC Radio 2 in 1982, when she guested on You're Tearing Me Apart, Terence Pettigrew's documentary which commemorated the 25th anniversary of Dean's death {{in a car accident}} in 1955. Also on the program were singer-actor Adam Faith and the screenwriter Ray Connolly.|$|E

5|$|The first {{sequel to}} Species, Species II was {{released}} theatrically in April 1998. The film depicts astronauts {{on a mission}} to Mars being attacked by the aliens from Species, and the events that ensue upon their return to Earth. There, Dr. <b>Baker</b> <b>has</b> been working on Eve, a more docile clone of Sil. Madsen and Helgenberger reprised their roles, while Henstridge played Eve. Species II was received by critics worse than the first film, garnering a 9% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and Madsen denounced it as a terrible film. The film's director, Peter Medak, attributed the failure of the film to not picking up the infected rat ending of the original film. Navarro later authored the novelization for Species II which followed the film's original screenplay with added scenes.|$|E

25|$|Opening acts for {{the band}} {{included}} the bands Free, Taste and an R rock act called Delaney & Bonnie. Because Clapton liked the soulful, folksy-sounding blues of Delaney & Bonnie, he began spending {{most of his time}} with them instead of Blind Faith, letting Winwood take a more prominent role in the band. Clapton even began sitting in on their opening sets, sometimes simply playing percussion, and showing more interest in them than his own band. <b>Baker</b> <b>has</b> since said it was obvious that Clapton was going to leave the band as soon as the tour was over.|$|E
25|$|Baker was in {{his thirties}} when his {{professional}} acting career began, and his first major film role was as Grigori Rasputin in Nicholas and Alexandra in 1971, when he was 37. He went on to play the villainous Prince Koura in The Golden Voyage of Sinbad in 1973, which led to his casting in Doctor Who. During his period as its star, the series was distinguished by high viewing figures and many stories which became regarded as classics. He {{remains one of the}} most instantly recognisable incarnations of the character. He continued to win regular roles in TV later in his career, most notably in the series Medics and Monarch of the Glen.

25|$|The {{term was}} invented by Peter Stephen Du Ponceau, who {{considered}} polysynthesis, as characterized by sentence words and noun incorporation, {{a defining feature of}} all Native American languages. This characterization was shown to be wrong, since many indigenous American languages are not polysynthetic, but {{it is a fact that}} polysynthetic languages are not evenly distributed throughout the world, but more frequent in the Americas, Australia, Siberia, and New Guinea; however, there are also examples in other areas. The concept became part of linguistic typology with the work of Edward Sapir, who used it as one of his basic typological categories. Recently, Mark C. <b>Baker</b> <b>has</b> suggested formally defining polysynthesis as a macro-parameter within Noam Chomsky's principles and parameters theory of grammar. Other linguists question the basic utility of the concept for typology since it covers many separate morphological types that have little else in common.|$|E
25|$|While Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, and Paul McGann {{have all}} reprised their roles for audio adventures {{produced}} since the 1990s by Big Finish (and sometimes the BBC), Baker {{had declined to}} voice the Doctor until 2009, claiming that he hadn't seen a script he liked. In July 2009, the BBC announced that Baker {{would return to the}} role for a series of five audio dramas, co-starring Richard Franklin as Captain Mike Yates, which would begin release in September. The five audios comprise a single linked story under the banner title Hornets' Nest, written by well-known author Paul Magrs. He returns with a sequel to Hornets' Nest called Demon Quest. <b>Baker</b> <b>has</b> also filmed inserts for a video release of the unfinished Shada in 1992, presented the video release The Tom Baker Years (1992), the latter a look back at his time on the series watching short clips from his episodes and also provided narration for several BBC audio releases of old Doctor Who stories.|$|E
25|$|The Witch {{has raised}} Rapunzel {{as her own}} daughter, keeping her locked away from {{the world in a}} tall tower {{in the middle of the}} woods, {{accessible}} only by climbing Rapunzel's long, golden hair ("Our Little World"). However, on this day a handsome prince spies the beautiful Rapunzel and resolves to climb the tower himself. In another part of the wood, the <b>Baker</b> <b>has</b> tracked down Little Red Ridinghood. Following the Witch's advice, he attempts to simply steal the red cape, but her ensuing temper tantrum guilts him into returning it. When Little Red Ridinghood arrives at her grandmother's house, she is swallowed by the Wolf. The Baker, in pursuit of the cape, slays the Wolf, pulling Little Red Ridinghood and her grandmother from the beast's innards. Little Red Riding hood rewards him with the red cape, reflecting on her new experiences ("I Know Things Now"). Meanwhile, Jack's mother angrily tosses the beans aside, which end up growing into an enormous stalk overnight, and sends her son to bed without supper. As Cinderella flees the Festival, pursued by another handsome prince and his steward, the Wife helps her hide and quizzes Cinderella about the ball. Cinderella explains that it was a nice ball ("A Very Nice Prince") but seems fairly ambivalent about the experience. As a giant beanstalk begins to sprout from the ground next to Jack's cottage, the Baker's Wife spots Cinderella's pure gold slippers. She tries to chase after Cinderella but inadvertently allows Milky White to run off, leaving the Baker's Wife without the slippers or the cow. The characters each state morals and credos as the first midnight chimes ("First Midnight") and they continue their journeys through the woods.|$|E
