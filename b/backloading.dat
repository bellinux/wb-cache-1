A year later, his {{business had}} grown even more, and he started a shipping agency. Through this agency, Spark sold incoming cargoes, exporting stores to places such as Hobart, colonial produce to Calcutta, and wool consignments (the first {{of what would be}} very many wool consignments) to London, <b>backloading</b> merchandise when it was possible. Additionally, Spark worked as a sort of agent for farmers and country settlers by purchasing their produce and selling them supplies such as livestock and stores, as well as the occasional ploughman or overseer. At this particular time, Spark owned more than six thousand acres (24km²) of land on the Hunter River and a nine-acre (4 hectare) grant at Woolloomooloo; Spark had developed a passion for land ownership. In 1835, the designer John Verge (who also built Elizabeth Bay House) helped Spark complete his property, now named Tusculum outside of Wolloomooloo Hill (now known as Potts Point). It now houses The Royal Australian Institute of Architects.|$|E

50|$|Although a {{cash balance}} plan is {{technically}} a defined benefit plan {{designed to allow}} workers to evaluate the economic worth their pension benefit {{in the manner of}} a defined contribution plan (i.e., as an account balance), the target benefit plan is a defined contribution plan designed to express its projected impact in terms of lifetime income as a percent of final salary at retirement (i.e., as an annuity amount). For example, a target benefit plan may mimic a typical defined benefit plan offering 1.5% of salary per year of service times the final 3-year average salary. Actuarial assumptions like 5% interest, 3% salary increases and the UP84 Life Table for mortality are used to calculate a level contribution rate that would create the needed lump sum at retirement age. The problem with such plans is that the flat rate could be low for young entrants and high for old entrants. While this may appear unfair, the skewing of benefits to the old worker is a feature of most traditional defined benefit plans, and any attempt to match it would reveal this <b>backloading</b> feature.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of any transport operation {{is dependent on}} the degree to which vehicle capacity is utilised on the forward and return trips. Efficiency requirements create the logistical challenges of finding <b>backloads</b> for returning vehicles. In the absence of <b>backloads,</b> vehicles travel empty on the return journey. Construction is fundamentally different from other freight services in that apart from requiring large quantities of material inputs, it also generates appreciable levels of waste. There is therefore, potential for reducing empty running by construction trucks through back-loading waste to points of disposal, reuse, recycling or reclamation. Back-loading, {{which is one of the}} reverse logistics processes is important for returning products that are damaged, obsolete or worn out and those unacceptable to buyers. Back-loading is also associated with utilising spare capacity in the supply chain to increase return on truck investment.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the Europe Unions {{emission}} trading system (EU ETS) has experienced very low prices. This has triggered a political discussion about stabilising the EU ETS and improving incentives for investing in CO 2 abatement. As {{a result of this}} discussion, the EU parliament accepted a proposal of the EU commission on the <b>backloading</b> of EU emission allowances (EUA), where the auctioning of EUAs is postponed to future time periods. Secondly the EU commission proposed a market stability reserve (MSR), which is a quantity based stabilisation policy, triggered by the amount of EUAs in circulation. Both policy measures together mark a significant change of the EU ETS policy framework. Using an agent-based electricity market simulation with endogenous investment and a CO 2 market (including banking), we analyse the <b>backloading</b> reform and the proposed market stability reserve. We find <b>backloading</b> to have a short-term impact of CO 2 prices; however, with and without <b>backloading</b> the EU ETS shows a risk of high CO 2 prices and volatility. The market stability might act counter to its objectives: we found it to create a scarcity of credits and following this a high risk of CO 2 price shocks and CO 2 price volatility. This is because the target corridor for banking of the MSR is set below the hedging need of power producers. Engineering, Systems and ServicesTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{rational}} expectations {{model in which}} speculative bubbles in house prices can emerge. We show that if a bubble arises, speculators and lenders both prefer mortgages with low initial payments that rise steeply {{over the course of}} the mortgage, but such mortgages cannot make both parties better off in our model when there is no bubble. This suggests the use of <b>backloaded</b> mortgages may confirm the existence of a bubble if other explanations for their use can be ruled out. Using data from US cities between 2000 – 2008, we find that interest-only (IO) mortgages with <b>backloaded</b> payments were indeed used sparingly in cities where house prices did not rise appreciably, but were common in cities where house prices rose sharply and then crashed. We confirm that the use of IOs in these cities is not proxying for other mortgage characteristics such as subprime, securitization, or high leverage. Moreover, the use of IOs is not simply a response to houses becoming more expensive; if anything, their use anticipated future appreciation. These findings thus lend support to the view that the boom-and-bust in housing prices was associated with a speculative bubble...|$|R

40|$|The Federal Government is {{actively}} involved in encouraging the formation and growth of private pensions and in regulating their behavior. The primary form of encouragement is the government's tax subsidization of pensions. A primary attribute of pension plan provisions is an implicit tax on employment after certain ages. The primary form of pension regulation is through ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The government's involvement in encouraging and regulating private pensions appears to reflect its desire that workers have a secure source of old age income which will lessen their reliance on Social Security. In recent years the government has reacted to demographic changes, and their effects on Social Security funding, {{and the increase in}} early retirement by also using its pension and Social Security tax and regulatory policies to encourage workers to delay their retirement decision. This paper examines the structure of pension plans with two questions in mind. First have government pension <b>backloading</b> regulations aimed at assuring future pension benefits been effective? and, second, has the structure of old age pension accrual {{at the end of the}} workspan, an implicit tax, greatly limited the effectiveness of government policy in reversing the trend to early retirement? The answers to these questions are important for assessing the benefits of the government's tax subsidization of pensions, as they are currently structured. The principal findings of this study are: (1) ERISA regulations notwithstanding, a significant proportion of defined benefit plans exhibit severe <b>backloading.</b> Indeed, <b>backloading</b> is an inherent property of defined benefit pension plans. (2) A large fraction of defined benefit plans embed very substantial old age work disincentives, through an implicit tax on wage earnings. (3) These pension retirement incentives are often much greater than Social Security's retirement incentives. (4) Evidence from one large Fortune 500 firm indicates that pension retirement incentives can greatly increase the extent of early retirement. ...|$|E
