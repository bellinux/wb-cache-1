40|$|Ammonium nitrate (NH 4 NO 3) is {{a common}} {{constituent}} of atmospheric particulate pollutants. It exists in five stable polymorphic forms, designated as phases V, IV, III, II and I, below its melting point of 170 degrees C. In atmospheric research, very {{little attention has been}} paid to the solid phase transitions of NH 4 NO 3 because phase IV NH 4 NO 3 particles are stable over a wide range of tropospheric temperatures. Potassium nitrate (KNO 3) is often found to co-exist with NH 4 NO 3 in atmospheric aerosols, and it can change the phase transition behaviors of solid NH 4 NO 3 particles. In this study, we investigated the effects of KNO 3 on the solid phase transitions of NH 4 NO 3 particles using in situ microscopic Raman spectroscopy. Both the transition path and transition temperature of NH 4 NO 3 single particles (40 - 700 mu m) depend on the KNO 3 <b>mass</b> <b>percentage</b> and the particle size. With the addition of KNO 3, the IV -> II transition, which appears at 52 degrees C for pure NH 4 NO 3 particles, is replaced by the IV -> III transition. The KNO 3 <b>mass</b> <b>percentage</b> required for this change in transition path increases with decreasing particle size and the transition temperature decreases with increasing KNO 3 <b>Mass</b> <b>percentage.</b> At a relatively high <b>mass</b> <b>percentage</b> of KNO 3 (>= 7. 4 wt%), the KNO 3 /NH 4 NO 3 mixed particles undergo the IV -> III transition under ambient temperatures, or even crystallize directly in phase III from droplets with a further increase in the <b>mass</b> <b>percentage</b> of KNO 3. Submicron KNO 3 /NH 4 NO 3 particles crystallize to phase IV at low KNO 3 <b>mass</b> <b>percentages</b> (= 7. 4 wt%). These results suggest that atmospheric solid NH 4 NO 3 particles may exist in phase III and the phase transitions should not be ignored in atmospheric chemical models. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a reliable, non-invasive and effective technique for measuring body composition. The aim of the study was to evaluate correlations between osteoprotegerin serum levels and body composition parameters in sleep apnea patients and their influence on cardiovascular risk. Material and methods: A total of 125 patients with newly diagnosed OSA were enrolled in the study (including 34 females). The mean age was 54. 48  ±  8. 81 years, mean AHI 33. 16  ±  20. 44 /h and mean BMI 33. 76  ±  7. 18. A control group comprised 59 healthy subjects with mean age of 51. 27  ±  12. 97 years and mean BMI 29. 47  ±  5. 42. All subjects underwent a nocturnal respiratory polygraphy and body composition measurements were taken with bioelectrical impedance analysis. OPG serum levels were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Results: In OSA patients OPG correlated negatively with muscle <b>mass</b> <b>percentage</b> (MM%), phase angle, fat free <b>mass</b> <b>percentage</b> (FFM%) and body cell <b>mass</b> <b>percentage</b> (BCM%), while there was a positive correlation between osteoprotegerin and fat <b>mass</b> <b>percentage</b> (FM%).

Differences in body composition may lead to imprecision in estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) derived from serum creatinine.

We analyzed data from a cross-sectional study comprising 1, 630 randomly selected community-dwelling adults. The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations were used to calculate eGFR from IMDS-standardized serum creatinine. Body mass index and body surface area were calculated from measured height and weight. Body composition was determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, handgrip strength measured by a hand-held dynamometer. Regression analysis was used to examine the association between eGFR and other factors. In women, eGFR determined by the MDRD equation was inversely associated with height (β = - 0. 08; p = 0. 012), lean <b>mass</b> <b>percentage</b> (β = - 0. 06; p = 0. 047) and handgrip strength (β = - 0. 15; p < 0. 001) and eGFR calculated using the CKD-EPI equation was inversely associated with handgrip strength (β = - 0. 08; p = 0. 001).

The {{size of the}} silver {{nanoparticles}} seems to drive {{the formation of the}} nanocomposite, yielding a homogeneous dispersion of the silver nanoparticles in the alanine matrix or flocs of silver nanoparticles segregated from the alanine crystals. The alanine crystalline orientation is modified according to the particle size of the silver nanoparticles. Concerning a <b>mass</b> <b>percentage</b> of silver below 0. 1 %, the nanocomposites are homogeneous, and there is no particle aggregation. As the <b>mass</b> <b>percentage</b> of silver is increased, the system becomes unstable, and there is particle flocculation with subsequent segregation of the alanine crystals. The nanocomposites have been analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and they have been tested as radiation detectors by means of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy in order to detect the paramagnetic centers created by the radiation. In fact, the sensitivity of the radiation detectors is optimized in the case of systems containing small particles (30 nm) that are well dispersed in the alanine matrix. As the agglomeration increases, particle growth (up to 1. 5 mu m) and segregation diminish the sensitivity. In conclusion, nanostructured materials can be used for optimization of alanine sensitivity, by taking into account the influence of the particles size of the silver nanoparticles on the detection properties of the alanine radiation detectors, thus contributing to the construction of small-sized detectors.

25|$|The {{development}} of disc-type brakes began in England in the 1890s, {{but they were}} not practical or widely available in cars for another 60 years. Successful application began in airplanes before World War II, and even the German Tiger tank was fitted with discs in 1942. After the war, technological progress began to arrive in the 1950s, leading to a critical demonstration of superiority at the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans race, which required braking from high speeds several times per lap. The Jaguar racing team won, using disc brake equipped cars, with much of the credit being given to the brakes' superior performance over rivals equipped with drum <b>brakes.</b> <b>Mass</b> production began with the 1955 Citroën DS.|$|R
