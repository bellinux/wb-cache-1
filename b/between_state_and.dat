50|$|The {{scope of}} the Convention is limited. It applies only to {{treaties}} concluded <b>between</b> <b>states,</b> so it does not cover agreements <b>between</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> international organizations or between international organizations themselves, though if any of its rules are independently binding on such organizations, they remain so. It does apply, however, to treaties <b>between</b> <b>states</b> within an intergovernmental organization. However, agreements <b>between</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> international organizations, or between international organizations themselves, will be governed by the 1986 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties <b>between</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> International Organizations or Between International Organizations if it ever enters into force. Also, in treaties <b>between</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> international organizations, {{the terms of the}} Convention still apply <b>between</b> the <b>state</b> members. The Convention does not apply to agreements not in written form.|$|R

In 1857, the State of Mexico and all other states would keep their federal status permanently under the constitution adopted that year.|$|E

40|$|Though {{scholars}} have long explored {{the determinants of}} negotiation outcomes at the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> non-state levels separately, negotiations <b>between</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> non-state actors have been understudied. Of the work that addresses negotiations <b>between</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> non-state armed groups (NSAGs), the variables typically used to explain outcomes are generally external to actual talks. My research shifts the analytic focus from the strategic context in which negotiations take place to the negotiations themselves. The principal research question is, "How do negotiation strategies affect outcomes in negotiations <b>between</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> non-state armed groups (NSAGs) ?" To answer this question, I derive a series of hypotheses, deductively and from existing literature, and evaluate those hypotheses using qualitative methods in case studies from the Middle East and Latin America. I find that certain combinations of negotiation strategies favor negotiation success, and other combinations favor negotiation failure. Dissertatio...|$|R
25|$|During the {{transition}} period, Clinton sought {{to build a}} more powerful State Department. She began a push for a larger international affairs budget and an expanded role in global economic issues. She cited {{the need for an}} increased U.S. diplomatic presence, especially in Iraq where the U.S. Defense Department had conducted diplomatic missions. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates agreed with her, and also advocated larger State Department budgets. Indeed, the two, and their respective departments, would have a productive relationship, unlike the often fraught relations <b>between</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> Defense and their secretaries seen in prior administrations.|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} dealing with HIV in June 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) of the UN {{called for the}} {{decriminalization}} of drugs particularly including injected ones. This conclusion put WHO at odds with broader long-standing UN policy favoring criminalization. Eight states of the United States (Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington), {{as well as the}} District of Columbia, have legalized the sale of marijuana for personal recreational use as of 2017, despite the fact that recreational use remains illegal under U.S. federal law. The conflict <b>between</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> federal law is as of 2017 unresolved.|$|E
25|$|The Church of Sweden was instigated by King Gustav I (1523–60) {{and within}} the half century {{following}} his death had become established as a Lutheran state church with significant power in Swedish society, itself {{under the control of}} the state apparatus. A degree of freedom of worship (for foreign residents only) was achieved under the rule of Gustav III (1771–92), but it was not until the passage of the Dissenter Acts of 1860 and 1874 that Swedish citizens were allowed to leave the state church – and then only provided that those wishing to do so first registered their adhesion to another, officially approved denomination. Following years of discussions that began in 1995, the Church of Sweden was finally separated from the state as from 1 January 2000. However, the separation was not fully completed. Although the status of state religion came to an end, the Church of Sweden nevertheless remains Swedens national church, and as such is still regulated by the government through the law of the Church of Sweden. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to refer to a change of relation <b>between</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> church rather than a separation. Furthermore, the Swedish constitution still maintain that the Sovereign and the members of the royal family has to confess an evangelical Lutheran faith, which in praxis means they need to be members of the Church of Sweden to remain in the line of succession. Thusly according to the ideas of cuius regio, eius religio one could argue that the symbolic connection <b>between</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> church still remains.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{in an effort}} to boost Downtown and upgrade the city's western entrance, Federal and state Urban Cultural Park grants were used on Mill Street, a small brick-paved street <b>between</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> Church streets. Two {{restaurants}} opened with great success but later folded during Downtown's continued decline. The project was a failure and was home to abandoned concrete kiosks, planters, and benches all disgraced by graffiti as of 2006. Another failed attempt at urban renewal was the $11 million Canal Square shopping plaza next to Proctor's Theatre in the 1980s. This was praised by then-President of the United States Ronald Reagan {{as an example of the}} good that could be done by the smart use of urban renewal money. The shopping plaza, however, failed due to suburban competition. Another proposal that never got off the ground was to level Proctor's for a shopping mall.|$|E
25|$|In 1852 the Original Secession Church {{joined the}} Free Church; in 1876 {{most of the}} Reformed Presbyterian Church {{followed}} suit. However, a leadership-led attempt to unite with the United Presbyterians was not successful. These attempts began as early as 1863 when the Free Church began talks with the UPC {{with a view to}} a union. However, a report laid before the Assembly of 1864 showed that the two churches were not agreed as to the relationship <b>between</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> church. The Free Church maintained that national resources could be used in aid of the church, provided that the state abstain from all interference in its internal government. The United Presbyterians held that, as the state had no authority in spiritual things, it was not within its jurisdiction to legislate as to what was true in religion, prescribe a creed or any form of worship for its subjects, or to endow the church from national resources. Any union would therefore have to leave this question open. At the time this difference was sufficient to preclude the union being pursued.|$|E
25|$|Lt. Gen. Grant, {{failing to}} find Stanton at the War Department, sent {{a note to}} his home by courier {{on the evening of}} April 21. The matter was urgent. Maj. Gen. Sherman, who had {{established}} his army headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, had negotiated a peace deal with Confederate commander Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, with the grace of Confederate States Secretary of War John C. Breckinridge. Sherman had been authorized to negotiate with the Southerners only in matters regarding the military, as Grant had been with Lee. Sherman explicitly acknowledged that his negotiations with Confederate leaders were to stay firmly in the realm of military policy, but flouted the limitations anyway. Sherman's deal contained, as expected, a termination of hostilities with the South, but also specified that Southern governments who had rebelled against the United States were to be recognized by the federal government once they swore allegiance to the United States. Further, the deal's terms provided for federal courts to be reinstated in rebellious states, as well as the restoration of property and voting rights to Southerners, and a blanket pardon for Southerners who had rebelled. The deal went even further, allowing Southern troops to place their weapons in the hands of their states' governments, which would effectively rearm the Southern states. Sherman's truce also allotted power to the Supreme Court to resolve jurisdictional disputes <b>between</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> local governments in the South, which was a political issue, and not a legal issue, making that a power the court did not constitutionally have.|$|E
