25|$|The week {{following}} the Tottenham game {{was spent in}} remembrance of the Munich air disaster, the 50th anniversary of which fell on 6 February 2008. United's home game against Manchester City on 10 February was preceded by a minute's silence in memory {{of those who died}} at Munich, and both teams wore special kits for the occasion; United wore a kit similar in design to the kit worn by the 1958 team, devoid of sponsors' logos and the club crest, while Manchester City also wore a kit without a sponsor's logo and with a black ribbon embroidered on the right shoulder. However, on a day intended to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the red half of Manchester, the team in blue took the lead after just 24 minutes. They then went 2–0 up just before half time, with debutant Benjani heading for goal. The Reds came out much stronger after the break, but were unable to score until the final minute, when Michael Carrick shot home from 18 yards. The next day, Arsenal beat Blackburn 2–0 to open up a five-point lead {{at the top of the}} table.|$|E

Hill has spoken frequently about how having a child lessened the amount of time she had for climbing but not her love for it. As she said in one interview, [...] "I feel that right now, it doesn't have to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> me and my experiences. I was ready to begin a new role; to face new challenges and adventures as a mother. It's a good learning experience adjusting to the sacrifices that need to be made." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} Waugh's intention {{to attempt a}} novel appears in a letter dated May 1924, to his schoolfriend Dudley Carew. Waugh writes: [...] "Quite soon I am {{going to write a}} little book. It is going to be called The Temple at Thatch and will <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> magic and madness". This writing project may have been a reaction to Waugh's immediate circumstances; he was in the last weeks of his Oxford career, contemplating failure in his examinations and irritated by {{the fact that most of}} his contemporaries appeared to be on the verge of brilliant careers. On [...] 22 June 1924 he spent time working out the plot, a continuation of the supernatural theme explored in [...] "Unacademic Exercise". The basic premise was an undergraduate inheriting a country house of which nothing was left except an 18th-century folly, where he set up house and practised black magic.|$|E

500|$|West {{received}} similar {{approval from}} Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy, {{both of whom}} contributed to the album. During an interview, when asked what music today inspires him, Wayne stated [...] "everybody's doing their thing, but they're not exciting. Everybody {{is doing the same}} thing. That's terrible. Do I love the music that's out right now? I love it with a passion. Does it motivate me? Not one bit. That's because 808s & Heartbreak isn't out yet." [...] Despite the approval from the rap superstars, as well as the record-breaking chart performances of the first two singles, hip hop audiences remained indifferent towards the album, predicting it would flop. Responding to reviews, West stated that he didn't care about sales or getting good ratings, saying that it came from the heart and that's all that matters to him. When asked about the current state of hip hop, West compared it to a high school, stating that hip hop used to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> being fearless and standing out, and that now it is about being afraid and fitting in. Michael Jackson was an admirer of the album, with his daughter saying he played it for her [...] "all the time".|$|E

Kirk Hammett and Robert Trujillo later confirmed the band's intention to enter the studio. At the second Orion Music + More festival held in Detroit, the band played under the name [...] "Dehaan"a reference to actor Dane DeHaan, who starred in Metallica: Through the Never. The band performed its debut album Kill 'Em All in its entirety, celebrating the 30th anniversary of its release. On December 8, 2013, the band played a show called [...] "Freeze 'Em All" [...] in Antarctica, becoming the first band to play on all seven continents. The performance was filmed and released as a live album the same month.|$|E
500|$|Japanese website 4Gamer.net {{referred}} to the series as one of Japan's biggest role-playing franchises. UGO Networks writer K. Thor Jensen cited the first Megami Tensei game as the first successful use of cyberpunk aesthetics in video games, saying that the series' mix of science fiction elements and the occult [...] "create a truly unique fictional cyberpunk world". Nintendo Power has noted that Atlus always mixes [...] "familiar gameplay" [...] with surprising settings when creating games for the series, citing Persona, with its [...] "modern-day horror stories" [...] and [...] "teams of Japanese high-school kids", as the perfect example. The editor also added that Strange Journey followed a similar system, calling it a [...] "science-fiction makeover" [...] of the series. In {{an article about the}} interaction of Japanese and Western gaming culture, 1UP.com mentioned the Shin Megami Tensei subseries alongside Nippon Ichi Software's Disgaea series. Kurt Kalata wrote: [...] " [...] may not be big sellers, but they've garnered underground success and attracted thousands of obsessed fans." [...] GameSpot writer Andrew Vestal {{referred to}} the series as the third biggest series in Japan after Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest.

500|$|Leave Home has various lyrical themes {{throughout}} its track list. The opening song, [...] "Glad to See You Go", is rather uptempo and frenetic. The track was about Dee Dee's then-girlfriend Connie, who {{was well known}} in the punk rock scene as having once dated New York Dolls bassist Arthur Kane and attempting to cut his finger off with a knife. Connie also harmed Dee Dee in several ways, such as slicing his buttocks with a beer bottle. At the time, every other member of the band despised Dee Dee's girlfriend and he eventually broke up with her. Joey recalls: [...] "Dee [...] and I came up with the song 'Glad to See You Go,' about Connie's leaving." [...] In the mid-1980s, Connie died from a drug overdose. [...] "Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment" [...] utilizes Joey's singing abilities with its vocal-demanding melody. Author Scott Schinder called the song a [...] "sing-along mental-illness ode." [...] The next song, [...] "I Remember You" [...] was said by author Greil Marcus to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the moment where [...] "Joey's voice turns the single word [...] "you" [...] into pure poetry." [...] "Oh, Oh, I Love Her So" [...] pays homage to the 1950s doo-wop genre, and consists of a three-chord barrage. The song was written solely by Joey, where in the song he humorously tells of how he met a girl at Burger King and they fell in love by a soda machine.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from gaming critics. Most critics acknowledged that Warriors of Rock {{was an attempt}} to distance itself from its competitor, the Rock Band series, and a return to the Guitar Hero series' roots. However, in the attempt to redefine the series, some critics thought Warriors of Rock failed to recapture the experience of playing the earlier Guitar Hero games. Arthur Gies of IGN felt the game was [...] "aimless", leaving him to question [...] "why Warriors of Rock is here". Tyler Cocke of 1UP.com commented that Warriors of Rock [...] "seems to have forgotten that music games are supposed to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> having a good time". Ben Kurchera of Ars Technica considered that Warriors of Rock keeps the series [...] "treading water" [...] and lacks [...] "any real upward movement", and may have been a step back with how relaxed the game's timing windows have become compared to early Guitar Hero games. Others note that the game can be enjoyable, but only to those that are fans of the series, and is not well-suited to new or casual players. G4's Abbie Heppe found the game [...] "does an exceptional job of catering to the hardcore audience" [...] but warns the casual fan that may not enjoy the setlist to simply [...] "move along". Matt Helgeson of Game Informer postulated if Guitar Hero may have jumped the shark with the [...] "often stupid and frequently silly" [...] gameplay and visuals, but was still entertained in playing through the game.|$|E

Reviewing for Forbes, Scott Mendelson cited the film's [...] "top-tier production values and a strong sense of scale and scope", but felt it was so much [...] "an exercise in fan service [...] it is only due to the charisma and talent of our newbies and J. J. Abrams' undeniable skill as a visual storyteller that the Mad Libs narrative doesn't outright destroy the picture". Brian Merchant of Motherboard wrote that [...] "Science fiction is supposed to <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> exploring the unexplored, not rehashing the well-trod … one of the most unabashedly creative enterprises of the 20th century has been rendered another largely enjoyable, but mostly forgettable Hollywood reboot." ...|$|E

She said of her departure: [...] "I've had the most fantastic time at EastEnders. Stacey has been such a brilliant role for me to play, as {{has been part of the}} feisty Slater family. I'm so lucky to have had such challenging storylines, from the affair with Max and being diagnosed with bipolar to the complete shock of being revealed as Archie's killer during the live 25th Anniversary episode. I'll miss Stacey and everyone in Albert Square very much but the time has come to try something different." [...] Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood added: [...] "We'll be very sad to see Lacey Turner leave the show. Lacey is one of the best young actresses on TV at the moment and the fact that she's won 28 awards in the last five years is testament to this. It's only right that someone as talented and versatile as Lacey should pursue new challenges and we wish her the very best of luck. In the meantime, viewers can look forward to a typically dramatic Slater family exit when she leaves and the door will be left open for Stacey Branning to return to Albert Square in the future." [...] During an interview on This Morning, Kirkwood revealed that Stacey will take centre stage at Christmas and will depart in a [...] "dramatic plotline" [...] and said [...] "Christmas will <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> [...] " [...] and explained the storyline would be [...] "a suitably dramatic and fitting departure for one of the all-time greats".
