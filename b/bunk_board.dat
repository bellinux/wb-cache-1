60|$|Mrs. Field felt {{hurt and}} angry at his rough joke. In the dim corner a cough was heard, {{and a yellow}} head raised itself over the <b>bunk</b> <b>board</b> ghastily. His big blue eyes fixed {{themselves}} on the lovely woman and he wore a look of childish wonder.|$|E
50|$|In {{later years}} Oscar Wisting {{was an active}} force behind the {{preparations}} and building of the Fram Museum in Oslo, a museum built to store and display the polar ship Fram. On 5 December 1936 Wisting was found dead from heart attack in his old <b>bunk</b> on <b>board</b> the Fram, {{a few days before}} the 25th anniversary of the successful South Pole expedition.|$|R
50|$|Whetstone {{took part}} in the lift of {{elements}} of the combat veterans of the 5th MarDiv from Da Nang to Okinawa. For the leathernecks, most of them coming straight from action in the field to the ship, the hot meals and <b>bunks</b> on <b>board</b> Whetstone proved a welcome change from life in the field. The ship subsequently arrived at Okinawa on 6 September to offload her troops.|$|R
60|$|Joe Bronson {{enjoyed that}} supper. The food was rough but good, and the smack {{of the salt}} air and the sea-fittings around him gave zest to his appetite. The cabin was clean and snug, and, though not large, the {{accommodations}} surprised him. Every bit of space was utilized. The table swung to the centerboard-case on hinges, so that {{when not in use}} it actually occupied no room at all. On either side and partly under the deck were two bunks. The blankets were rolled back, and the boys sat on the well-scrubbed <b>bunk</b> <b>boards</b> while they ate. A swinging sea-lamp of brightly polished brass gave them light, which in the daytime could be obtained through the four deadeyes, or small round panes of heavy glass which were fitted into the walls of the cabin. On one side of the door was the stove and wood-box, on the other the cupboard. The front end of the cabin was ornamented with a couple of rifles and a shot-gun, while exposed by the rolled-back blankets of French Pete's bunk was a cartridge-lined belt carrying a brace of revolvers.|$|R
60|$|These things I beheld in {{the long}} marigold-scented {{twilight}} and whispering night, loafing round the little house with California, who un-folded himself like a lotus to the moon, or in the little <b>boarded</b> <b>bunk</b> that was our bedroom, swap-ping tales with Portland and the old man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, Elsa," [...] he {{now said}} gaily, [...] "I chalked up the days--made marks, I mean, {{in a book}} which I bought in Fiume the day before we sailed. Seven hundred and thirty days--for I never meant to stay away more than two years; and every evening in my <b>bunk</b> on <b>board</b> ship and {{afterwards}} in the farm where I lodged, I scratched {{out one of the}} marks and seemed to feel myself getting a little bit nearer and then nearer to you. By the Saints, my dove," [...] he added, with a merry laugh, [...] "but you should have seen me the time I got cheated out of one of those scratches. I had forgotten that accursed twenty-ninth of February last year. I don't think that I have ever sworn so wickedly in my life before. I had to go to Melbourne pretty soon, I tell you, and make confession of it to the kind Pater there. And then [...] . . ." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Picture to {{yourself}} a tarpaper shack 79 feet x 24 with no windows, along each side {{there is a}} row of double decker bunks, these are spaced off with 8 × 1 board {{so that there is}} room for two men in each bunk. The bunks are filled with straw and you crawl into them from the foot end. Along the front of the lower <b>bunk</b> a narrow <b>board</b> is placed upon which the men may sit. The place is very meagerly lighted and ventilation by three skylights.... So narrow is the passageway between the bunks that when the men are sitting on the bench there is scarcely room to pass between them. This shack houses 88 men.... At times the place reeks of the foul smell and at night the air is simply fetid. The floor is dirty {{and the end of the}} shack where the men wash ... is caked with black mud. The toilet is thoroughly filthy, unsanitary, and far too small." ...|$|R
5000|$|Food {{were usually}} coarse and poor as {{refrigeration}} was not usually available aboard ship for crew provisions. Any frozen food available was from an ice-box {{and after the}} ice melted salt meat from brine tubs and butter from tins provided much of the staple diet. Fresh eggs, fruit and vegetables {{might or might not}} be provided on arrival in port dependent on the budget held by the Chief Steward which was spent only with permission from the Master who was there to ensure the success and profit of each voyage.Seamen lived in dark, confined, damp, poorly ventilated and often rusty dormitory accommodation with wooden <b>board</b> <b>bunks</b> three or more high, without running water and lacking heating. Each man might be provided one or two blankets at best and was expected to bring his own [...] "donkey's breakfast" [...] - a sack cloth bag containing straw which was to serve as a mattress.In the pre-war years seamen competed to sign on aboard vessels owned by shipping lines which were known as [...] "good feeders" [...] due to their staple diets being superior while others would be avoided for providing poor food, one (Hogarth & Sons of Glasgow) being commonly referred to as [...] "Hungry Hogarth's" [...] by seamen.|$|R
6000|$|Very solemnly and thankfully {{we put up}} our rods--it was glory {{enough for}} all time--and {{returned}} weeping in each other's arms--weeping tears of pure joy--to that simple bare-legged family in the packing-case house by the waterside. The old farmer recollected days and nights of fierce warfare with the Indians--"way back in the Fifties," [...] when every ripple of the Columbia River and her tributaries hid covert danger. God had dowered him with a queer crooked gift of expression, and a fierce anxiety {{for the welfare of}} his two little sons--tanned and reserved children who attended school daily, and spoke good English in a strange tongue. His wife was an austere woman who had once been kindly and perhaps handsome. Many years of toil had taken the elasticity out of step and voice. She looked for nothing better than everlasting work--the chafing detail of housework, and then a grave somewhere up the hill among the blackberries and the pines. But in her grim way she sympathised with her eldest daughter, a small and silent maiden of eighteen, who had thoughts very far from the meals she tended or the pans she scoured. We stumbled into the household at a crisis; and there was a deal of downright humanity in that same. A bad, wicked dressmaker had promised the maiden a dress in time for a to-morrow's railway journey, and, though the barefooted Georgie, who stood in very wholesome awe of his sister, had scoured the woods on a pony in search, that dress never arrived. So with sorrow in her heart, and a hundred Sister Anne glances up the road, she waited upon the strangers, and, I doubt not, cursed them for the wants that stood between her and her need for tears. It was a genuine little tragedy. The mother in a heavy, passionless voice rebuked her impatience, yet sat bowed over a heap of sewing for the daughter's benefit. These things I beheld in the long marigold-scented twilight and whispering night, loafing round the little house with California, who unfolded himself like a lotus to the moon; or in the little <b>boarded</b> <b>bunk</b> that was our bedroom, swapping tales with Portland and the old man. Most of the yarns began in this way: [...] "Red Larry was a bull-puncher back of Lone County, Montanna," [...] or [...] "There was a man riding the trail met a jack-rabbit sitting in a cactus," [...] or [...] "'Bout the time of the San Diego land boom, a woman from Monterey," [...] etc. You can try to piece out for yourselves what sort of stories they were.|$|R
