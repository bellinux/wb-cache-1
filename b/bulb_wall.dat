We report here on adult neurogenesis throughout the brains of two breeds of adult domestic pigeons (Columba livia domestica), the racing homer and utility carneau using endogenous immunohistochemical markers proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) for proliferating cells and doublecortin (DCX) for immature and migrating neurons. The distribution of PCNA and DCX immunoreactivity was very similar in both pigeon breeds with only a few minor differences. In both pigeons, PCNA and DCX immunoreactivity was observed in the olfactory <b>bulbs,</b> <b>walls</b> of the lateral ventricle, telencephalic subdivisions of the pallium and subpallium, diencephalon, mesencephalon and cerebellum. Generally, the olfactory bulbs and telencephalon had more PCNA and DCX cells than other regions. Two proliferative hotspots were evident in the dorsal and ventral poles of the lateral ventricles. PCNA- and DCX-immunoreactive cells migrated radially from the walls of the lateral ventricle into the parenchyma. In most telencephalic regions, the density of PCNA- and DCX-immunoreactive cells increased from rostral to caudal, except in the mesopallium where the density decreased from rostral to middle levels and then increased caudally. DCX immunoreactivity was more intense in fibres than in cell bodies and DCX-immunoreactive cells included small granular cells, fusiform bipolar cells, large round and or polygonal multipolar cells. The similarity in the distribution of proliferating cells and new neurons in the telencephalon of the two breeds of pigeons may suggest that adult neurogenesis is a conserved trait as an ecological adaptation irrespective of body size...|$|R

50|$|During activation, whilst {{the bulb}} {{is still on}} the pump, an R.F. {{induction}} heating coil connected to a powerful R.F. oscillator operating in the 27 MHz or 40.68 MHz ISM band is positioned around the bulb in the plane of the ring. The coil acts as the primary of a transformer and the ring as a single shorted turn. Large R. F. currents flow in the ring, heating it. The coil is moved along the axis of the bulb so as not to overheat and melt the ring. Once the ring is heated the barium azide decomposes into barium vapor and nitrogen. The nitrogen is pumped out and the barium condenses on the bulb above the plane of the ring forming a mirror like deposit with a large surface area. The powdered glass in the ring melts and entraps any particles which could otherwise escape loose inside the bulb causing later problems. The barium combines with any free gas when activated and continues to act after the bulb is sealed off from the pump. During use, the internal electrodes {{and other parts of the}} tube get hot. This can cause adsorbed gases to be released from metallic parts, such as anodes (plates), grids or non metallic—but porous—parts, such as sintered ceramic parts. The gas is trapped on the large area of reactive barium on the <b>bulb</b> <b>wall</b> and removed from the tube.|$|E

On the exterior Le Corbusier installed a stairway to provide second-floor access from ground level. Here, as in other projects from this period, he also designed the façades to include large uninterrupted banks of windows. The house used a rectangular plan, with exterior walls that were not filled by windows but left as white, stuccoed spaces.

40|$|The UK Government has set {{an ambitious}} {{legislative}} goal of reducing {{greenhouse gas emissions}} by 80 % by 2050. Of the total energy used in the UK, 31 % {{is used in the}} domestic sector. In the domestic sector energy is used for space and hot water heating, lighting, appliances and cooking. Space and hot water heating make up 82 % of the total energy used in the UK domestic sector. Almost all of the energy used in the UK domestic sector originates from depletable resources. In order for the UK to reach its goal of decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 % by 2050, the way energy is used in the UK domestic sector needs to change dramatically. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify opportunities for homeowners to be more sustainable without compromising their standard of living, by changing the way they use and supply energy. Homeowners’ ways of using and supplying energy today will be reviewed followed by an identification of measures that can be taken to create a more sustainable home from an energy perspective. Identified measures not only include usage of small-scale energy technologies but also application of energy efficiency measures and changes in behaviour that result in homeowners using energy in a more efficient way.   The aim has been achieved by conducting a literature review, collecting statistical data regarding energy use from the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the undertaking of a case study. The literature review revealed that air source and solar assisted heat pumps, solar photovoltaic (solar PV) and fuel cell micro combined heat and power (fuel cell mCHP) are the most promising and widely available microgeneration technologies on the market today. LED light <b>bulbs,</b> <b>wall</b> and loft insulation and energy efficient appliances are the energy efficiency measures identified as having the highest potential to decrease the amount of energy used. The literature review also proved that behaviour in relation to energy use is a key area to address in order to make homeowners use energy in a more efficient way.   The case study consisted of six case houses, based on the most common house types in the UK. The reference heating system used in the case study was a gas boiler connected to a central heating system of the house. 80 % of the homes in the UK are heated with a gas boiler and that is why it was chosen as a reference scenario. The case study showed that all of the microgeneration technologies use resources and energy in a more efficient way than the reference scenario. But despite the financial support of governmental subsidies none of the microgeneration technologies were financially viable options compared to a gas boiler. Energy efficiency measures, especially LED lighting, wall and loft insulation, significantly lowered the amount of energy used, they lowered the influence on greenhouse gas emissions and were financially viable options without the support of governmental subsidies.   It was identified that microgeneration technologies are impacted by behaviour and that they can enable demand-side management, especially as the number of supply-driven sources such as wind and solar PV increases.   In summation microgeneration technologies and energy efficiency measures have a large potential to help make homeowners become more sustainable from an energy perspective. Governmental support has a determining role in making them financially viable and therefore accessible to the public. ...|$|R

This {{is in the}} context of constraints imposed by networks of cell walls that both adhere cells and contribute to the form and function of developing organs. Here, we report the identification of a glycan epitope that is specific to phloem sieve element cell walls in several systems. A monoclonal antibody, designated LM 26, binds to the cell wall of phloem sieve elements in stems of Arabidopsis thaliana, Miscanthus x giganteus and notably sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) roots where phloem identification is an important factor for the study of phloem unloading of sucrose. Using microarrays of synthetic oligosaccharides, the LM 26 epitope has been identified as a β- 1, 6 -galactosyl substitution of β- 1, 4 -galactan requiring more than three backbone residues for optimized recognition. This branched galactan structure has previously been identified in garlic bulbs in which the LM 26 epitope is widespread throughout most cell walls including those of phloem cells. Garlic <b>bulb</b> cell <b>wall</b> material has been used to confirm the association of the LM 26 epitope with cell wall pectic rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) polysaccharides.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to study {{influence}} of different flooring systems on several aspects of locomotion of dairy cows. To assess the gait on different floors, trackway analysis was used. Cows walking on a hard, slippery surface had shorter strides, wider posture and asymmetric steps. A hard, slippery surface resulted in stride shortening, wider posture and asymmetric gait. Using soft rubber mats made gait patterns more similar to those on a natural yielding surface such as sand. When cows with moderate lameness walked on yielding surfaces their gait parameters associated with lameness were less pronounced than on hard concrete surfaces. Preference studies showed {{that the majority of}} cows preferred to walk and stand on soft rubber flooring rather than on concrete flooring. However, lame cows within the group did not show a stronger preference to walk on soft flooring than non-lame cows, presumably due to lower social rank compared to healthy herd mates. In order to assess the effects of long-term exposure to flooring systems differing in hardness and abrasiveness installed in the walking and standing areas an experimental study was carried out. Claw conformation, claw horn growth and wear rates, as well as static weight and pressure distribution were evaluated. On a rougher flooring (mastic asphalt), exaggerated wear, highest growth rate and a loss of sole concavity was seen, and most weight was exerted to the sole area of the claws. When rubber-equipped feed-stalls were used together with mastic asphalt in alleys cows showed reduced wear, positive net growth and reduced loss of the concavity compared to cows housed on asphalt alley surfaces. In comparison with asphalt flooring, rubber mats on the alleys resulted in lower growth and wear rates, increased net growth, preserved sole concavity and the <b>bulb</b> and <b>wall</b> area of the claw carried the most weight. Rubber mats together with little exposure to an abrasive asphalt surface resulted in claw horn net growth rates similar to that observed on aged, low abrasive concrete slatted floor.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: This is an {{analysis}} of early postcarotid endarterectomy (CEA) wall thickness in patients who have undergone bilateral operations with vein and Dacron patch reconstructions. Methods: In the past 5 years 23 patients had staged bilateral CEA within 2 months with an autologous greater saphenous vein patch {{on one side and}} a knitted Dacron patch on the other. Duplex scans with adequate B-mode resolution to measure common carotid <b>bulb</b> total <b>wall</b> thickness were performed in all 23 patients during the first post-CEA year and in 12 patients in the post-CEA second year. Results: There were no hemodynamically detectable restenoses by Doppler velocity criteria. All peak systolic velocities were ≤ 110 cm/sec. In the first post-CEA year the total wall thickness of the 23 vein patch CEA was 1. 7 ± 1. 0 mm (mean ± 1 SD; range, 0. 6 to 5. 5 mm), and the total wall thickness of the 22 Dacron patch CEA was 1. 7 ± 1. 1 mm (range, 0. 6 to 6. 1 mm, p = 0. 93). In the second post-CEA year wall thickness was 2. 1 ± 1. 8 mm (range, 0. 6 to 5. 8 mm) in the vein patch arteries and 2. 0 ± 1. 5 mm (range, 0. 6 to 5. 4 mm, p = 0. 91) in the Dacron patch arteries. Although wall thickness of both vein and Dacron patch CEA varied widely between patients, the within-patient absolute difference between the two sides was quite small, 0. 1 ± 0. 3 mm in the first year and 0. 2 ± 0. 5 mm in the second. With a 5 % chance of a type I statistical error (α = 0. 05) to detect a 0. 5 mm difference in wall thickness between Dacron and vein patch CEA, the power of the paired t test is > 0. 999, and the probability of a type II error, β, is 2 mm was associated with continued smoking (p = 0. 03). Conclusions: Post-CEA wall thickening is highly patient-dependent but is patch material-independent. Knitted Dacron and saphenous vein patch reconstructed carotid arteries develop almost identical wall thickness in a given patient in the first 2 years after endarterectomy. These results support the use of knitted Dacron as an acceptable alternative to greater saphenous for a CEA patch. (J Vasc Surg 1997; 25 : 554 - 60. ...|$|R
40|$|Solid-state nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance relaxation experiments can provide information on the rigidity of individual molecules within a complex structure such as a cell wall, and thus show how each polymer can potentially contribute to the rigidity of the whole structure. We measured the proton magnetic relaxation parameters T 2 (spin-spin) and T 1 p (spin-lattice) through the 13 C-nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} spectra of dry and hydrated cell walls from onion (Allium cepa L.) <b>bulbs.</b> Dry cell <b>walls</b> behaved as rigid solids. The form of their T 2 decay curves varied on a continuum between Gaussian, as in crystalline solids, and exponential, as in more mobile materials. The degree of molecular mobility that could be inferred from the T 2 and T 1 p decay patterns was consistent with a crystalline state for cellulose and a glassy state for dry pectins. The theory of composite materials may be applied to explain the rigidity of dry onion cell walls {{in terms of their}} components. Hydration made little difference to the rigidity of cellulose and most of the xyloglucan shared this rigidity, but the pectic fraction became much more mobile. Therefore, the cellulose/xyloglucan microfibrils behaved as solid rods, and the most significant physical distinction within the hydrated cell wall was between the microfibrils and the predominantly pectic matrix. A minor xyloglucan fraction was much more mobile than the microfibrils and probably corresponded to cross-links between them. Away from the microfibrils, pectins expanded upon hydration into a nonhomogeneous, but much softer, almost-liquid gel. These data are consistent with a model for the stress-bearing hydrated cell wall in which pectins provide limited stiffness across the thickness of the wall, whereas the cross-linked microfibril network provides much greater rigidity in other directions...|$|R

As outras duas zonas também são consideradas na simulação. No final são apresentados resultados da simulação para a verificação dos elementos construti-vos como vidros, proteções nas janelas, tipos de telhas, potência das lâmpadas e revestimen-tos. Conforme os resultados, serão propostas alterações no projeto. This work {{is dedicated}} to the simulation of energy efficiency of a new building to be erected at UFRGS (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul). This work is initiated with the construction of the model in 3 D utilizing two tools: Google Sketch-up and Open Plug-in, hav-ing in mind that during the model construction the Plug-in is always used. After the construc-tion of the model, analysis of the energy performance with the aid of the EnergyPlus is in-itiated. The simulations of the building will be carried out based on the Sizing Periods and with the Run Periods of Porto Alegre. The rooms of the building have been divided into eight zones in that six of them will be served by the system of acclimatization to be done by splits. The remaining two zones will also be considered in the simulation. At the end, results of the simulation for the verification of the building materials such as glass, window screens, types of roof-tiles, <b>bulb</b> power and <b>wall</b> coverings will be shown. Alterations in the project will be presented based on the results...|$|R

This study computes the spatial values of wall shear stresses and their gradients for three carotid artery bifurcation geometries. Methods: A computational fluid dynamics program was used to solve the transient two-dimensional partial differential equations that describe fluid flow. Blood was treated as both a Newtonian and a non-Newtonian incompressible fluid. Solutions for the velocities, wall shear stresses, and wall shear-stress gradients were obtained for three carotid bifurcation geometries: a normal carotid bifurcation (similar to a primarily carotid bifurcation geometries: a normal carotid bifurcation (similar to a primarily reconstructed carotid endarterectomy), a patch-reconstructed carotid endarterectomy, and a gradually tapered, low-angle carotid bifurcation (no carotid bulb). Results: Computed velocity profiles closely match published experimental ones. Disturbed flow velocities are largest in the bulb segment of the normal carotid bifurcation. Peak and minimum wall shear stresses and peak shear stress gradients occurred in the lateral internal carotid artery wall. These were binodal in the normal or primarily reconstructed carotid artery, localized at the distal end of the patch-reconstructed carotid bifurcation, and minimal in the smooth, tapered carotid bifurcation. Wall shear stresses and their gradients were slightly higher for non-Newtonian than Newtonian fluids in the normal carotid artery but were similar {{in the other two}} geometric configurations. Conclusion: These results indicate that flow disturbances in general and wall shear stress gradients in particular are markedly reduced in carotid artery bifurcations that are smooth and gradually tapered and do not have a <b>bulb.</b> Abrupt geometric <b>wall</b> changes such as those occurring in the normal carotid blub and at the distal end of a patch-reconstruction after carotid endarterectomy are harbingers of disturbed flow and high wall shear stress gradients. These results suggest that carotid endarterectomy reconstruction geometry characterized by a gradually tapered internal carotid artery may minimize the hemodynamically induced component of early myointimal hyperplasia and thrombosis and late atherosclerotic restenosi...|$|R
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Charles McDougall, his first credit for the series. According to Kinsey, McDougal, in order to set the characters' moods, would start every scene by saying [...] "everyone happy, Angela pissed!" [...] McDougal sought to bring movement to the Secret Santa scene, due to it being a largely stationary sequence. The cold opening was shot four different times, and almost every time, the ceiling tile that Michael displaces with a tree [...] "crashed through the ceiling and almost killed Steve Carell". The scene wherein Angela starts crying when the Christmas party descends into chaos {{was based on a}} deleted scene from the earlier season two episode [...] "The Fire", where Angela starts crying during a talking head due to the stress of the situation. The scenes featuring snow were created by a company that specialized in producing fake snow. Daniels was initially worried that the shots would look fake, but he was pleased with the final results. According to Fischer, {{on the last day of}} shooting, the cast had a snowball fight—a scene that is included in the episode—which she called a [...] "magic moment". Fischer later recounted that the prop egg nog and pigs in a blanket were kept out for three straight days, an act that she felt was revolting. In order to make her scenes more real Phyllis Smith forced herself to cry for [...] "30 minutes" [...] between takes. Many of the cast members asked her what was wrong, but Smith refused to speak to them, in order to stay in character. The series' writers researched local Pennsylvania laws and discovered one that states a liquor salesman must wear a tie. Thus, the show features a liquor store worker wearing a tie. Several of the scenes were improvised on the spot. During the sequence where Angela angrily throws Christmas <b>bulbs</b> at a <b>wall,</b> Angela Kinsey was unable to get them to break, so she decided to stomp on them. Kate Flannery improvised her line about not drinking only during the week while she was filming her talking head.|$|R
