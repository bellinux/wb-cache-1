5|$|Rowing {{is popular}} on the River Weaver, with {{competitive}} clubs in Runcorn, Northwich, and Acton Bridge (The Grange School). Fishing is another pastime {{which takes place}} along the river. Several clubs lease fishing rights for {{different parts of the}} river from British Waterways, as it holds populations of <b>bream,</b> three types of carp, chub, dace, eels, perch, pike, roach, rudd and tench. Fishing matches are regularly organised at weekends.|$|E
5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the park is Lake Trahlyta. The lake has a swimming beach and boat launch for non-motorized watercraft, and offers seasonal rentals for pedal boats,kayaks, and paddle boards. It contains bass and <b>bream</b> and is stocked periodically during each trout season with about 5,000 trout. Also at the park are a general store, miniature golf course and a Civilian Conservation Corps museum.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{is located}} in the south east part of the park. Fishing is {{permitted}} in the lake, which is stocked with large mouth bass, crappie, <b>bream,</b> and catfish. A 2002 renovation of the lake added a new bridge connecting the two bodies of water and three fishing piers located around the lake.|$|E

5|$|He was {{introduced}} to complex flamenco techniques by Spanish guitarist Paco de Lucía when the two shared a loft and performed together for the jet set in New York City in the early 1970s. In 1982, Laucke was selected by Andrés Segovia to perform for the PBS network at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. He became Segovia's pupil, and studied with other classical guitar players including Julian <b>Bream</b> and Alirio Díaz. Laucke performed mainly on classical guitar until 1990, {{and from then on}} his concerts consisted solely of flamenco and new flamenco.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Eisenberg portrayed Rolling Stone {{journalist}} David Lipsky in the biographical drama film The End of the Tour, appearing opposite Jason Segel, who {{portrayed the}} late author David Foster Wallace. Eisenberg's third play, The Spoils, premiered off-Broadway in The New Group Perishing Square Signature Center Alice Griffin Box Theatre. The play featuring Eisenberg as Ben, also starring Kunal Nayyar, Michael Zegen, Erin Darke, and Annapurna Sriram, {{was the winner}} of The Blanche and Irving Laurie Foundation Theatre Visions Fund Award. On September 8, 2015, Eisenberg released his first book, <b>Bream</b> Gives Me Hiccups, {{a collection of short}} humor pieces.|$|E

5|$|Malawian cuisine is diverse, with tea {{and fish}} being popular {{features}} of the country's cuisine. Sugar, coffee, corn, potatoes, sorghum, cattle and goats are also important components of the cuisine and economy. Lake Malawi {{is a source of}} fish including chambo (similar to <b>bream)</b> usipa (similar to sardine), and mpasa (similar to salmon and kampango). Nsima is a food staple made from ground corn and typically served with side dishes of meat and vegetables. It is commonly eaten for lunch and dinner.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{freshwater}} ponds (often called stews) held carp, pike, tench, <b>bream,</b> eel, and other fish. Poultry {{was kept in}} special yards, with pigeon and squab being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial {{to make use of}} nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Britten's {{other works}} range from orchestral to choral, solo vocal, chamber and {{instrumental}} {{as well as}} film music. He took {{a great interest in}} writing music for children and amateur performers, including the opera Noye's Fludde, a Missa Brevis, and the song collection Friday Afternoons. He often composed with particular performers in mind. His most frequent and important muse was his personal and professional partner, the tenor Peter Pears; others included Kathleen Ferrier, Jennifer Vyvyan, Janet Baker, Dennis Brain, Julian <b>Bream,</b> Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Mstislav Rostropovich. Britten was a celebrated pianist and conductor, performing many of his own works in concert and on record. He also performed and recorded works by others, such as Bach's Brandenburg concertos, Mozart symphonies, and song cycles by Schubert and Schumann.|$|E

5|$|Eisenberg is creating, writing, and {{directing}} a comedy adaptation of <b>Bream</b> Gives Me Hiccups with Jax Media, starring Parker Posey, Victor Rasuk, and Elliott Smith. A pilot was filmed in June. A {{sequel to the}} 2009 Zombieland is reportedly in development at Sony, with a logo for Zombieland 2 having debuted at 2016 CinemaCon. Writers of the first Zombieland, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, are penning the script, with David Callaham on board as writer with Ruben Fleischer as director. In May 2016, Eisenberg teased {{that he would be}} reprising his role as Lex Luthor in the upcoming Justice League film. This was restated in an interview with ShortList magazine the following month. An official press kit, released by Warner Bros. on December 22, 2016 confirmed the return.|$|E
5|$|Exceptionally heavy {{rainfall}} in November 2012 caused a major {{break in the}} Grand Western Canal's banks, near Halberton, necessitating nearby homes to be evacuated. Two temporary dams were installed which allowed {{the rest of the}} canal to remain open and meant the horse drawn barge at Tiverton was able to run throughout the summer of 2013. Around 400 fish were returned to the canal from a flooded field but many fish including pike, eels, perch, <b>bream,</b> tench and roach were lost. About 25 people from the Environment Agency and Tiverton Angling Club assisted with saving the fish. The Environment Agency restocked the canal with 3,000 fish in January 2013 and by May the Environment Agency said they were flourishing.|$|E
5|$|Small {{numbers of}} frill sharks are caught {{incidentally}} by various deepwater commercial fisheries around the world, using trawls, gillnets, and longlines. In particular, it is regularly taken in Suruga Bay in bottom gillnets meant for sea <b>bream</b> and gnomefish, and in midwater trawls {{meant for the}} shrimp Sergia lucens. Japanese fishermen regard it as a nuisance, as it damages the nets. This shark is sometimes sold for meat or processed into fishmeal, but is not economically significant. Because of its very low reproductive rate and the continuing expansion of commercial fisheries into its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has previously listed it as Near Threatened, although the species was downlisted to Least Concern in 2016.|$|E

5|$|The {{angelshark}} is {{an ambush}} predator that feeds mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes, especially flatfishes, though it also preys on skates and invertebrates. Prey reported taken include the hake Merluccius merluccius, the <b>bream</b> Pagellus erythrinus, grunts in the genus Pomadasys, the flatfishes Bothus spp., Citharus linguatula, and Solea solea, the squid Loligo vulgaris, the cuttlefishes Sepia officinalis and Sepiola spp., and the crabs Medorippe lanata, Geryon trispinosus, Dromia personata, Goneplax rhomboides, Liocarcinus corrugatus, and Atelecyclus rotundatus. The stomachs of some examined specimens have also contained seagrass or birds (in one case an entire cormorant). Individual sharks select sites that {{offer the best}} ambush opportunities, and if successful, may remain there for several days.|$|E
5|$|The menu at Pétrus {{is split}} into several fixed price menus, {{containing}} modern French cuisine. It {{has been described}} by Zoe Williams as being distinctly Gordon Ramsay in composition, despite the influences of head chef Sean Burbidge. The meals come with an amuse-bouche, a pre-starter course, and after dinner chocolates in addition to the items listed on the menus themselves. A number of pan fried fish dishes have been on the menu, including mackerel with tomato chutney and a niçoise salad, and a sea <b>bream</b> course served with brown shrimp, samphire and an oyster velouté sauce. Further seafood related dishes include a langoustine and watercress soup entrée which was praised by food critic Jay Rayner. Sauces are generally delivered to the table in small jugs and are poured tableside.|$|E
5|$|Especially {{important}} was the fishing and trade in herring and cod in the Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. The herring was of unprecedented significance to the economy of much of Northern Europe, {{and it was one}} of the most common commodities traded by the Hanseatic League, a powerful north German alliance of trading guilds. Kippers made from herring caught in the North Sea could be found in markets as far away as Constantinople. While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. Stockfish, cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of mollusks including oysters, mussels and scallops were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater crayfish were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most. Freshwater fish such as pike, carp, <b>bream,</b> perch, lamprey and trout were common.|$|E
