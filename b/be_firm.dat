Luna's death was publicly declared only by 8 June, and a circular providing details of the event released by 13 June. While investigations were supposedly made concerning Luna's death, not one person was convicted. Later, General Pantaleon García {{said that it was}} he who was verbally ordered by Aguinaldo to conduct the assassination of Luna at Cabanatuan. His sickness at the time prevented his participation in the assassination. Aguinaldo would <b>be</b> <b>firm</b> in his stand that {{he had nothing to do}} with the assassination of Luna.|$|E

In such times the deaf-mutes, insane, and children are legally unfit for blowing the trumpets. Johanan ben Zakkai established that the shofar trumpets be blown at Jamnia and the surrounding places even if the festival fell on the Sabbath, while at one time this was done only in the Temple (iv.1); he also fixed the lulav outside of the Temple for seven days, and forbade the eating of new grain {{on the second day of}} Passover (iv.2); he extended the time for examining witnesses until the evening, and had them come to Jamnia even in the absence of the av bet din (iv.3). The Mishnah then treats of the order of the prayers (iv.4), of the succession of the Malkuyot, Zikronot, and Shoferot, of the Bible sentences concerning the kingdom of God, Providence, and the trumpet-call of the future (iv.5), and of the leader in prayer and his relation to the teki'ah (iv.6); descriptions of the festival are given in reference to the shofar (iv.7); then follows the order of the traditional trumpet-sounds (iv.8); and remarks on the duties of the leader in prayer and of the congregation close the treatise (iv.9).|$|E

500|$|This {{site was}} {{selected}} {{on the basis}} of several criteria. The plutonium pilot facilities needed to be [...] from the site boundary and any other installation, in case radioactive fission products escaped. While security and safety concerns suggested a remote site, it still needed to be near sources of labor, and accessible by road and rail transportation.

Terrain separated by ridges would reduce the impact of accidental explosions, but they could not be so steep as to complicate construction. The substratum needed to <b>be</b> <b>firm</b> enough to provide good foundations, but not so rocky that it would hinder excavation work.

500|$|In 1942, the Manhattan Project was {{attempting}} to construct the first atomic bombs. This would require production facilities, and by June 1942 the project had reached the stage where their construction could be contemplated. On 25 June, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) S-1 Executive Committee deliberated on {{where they should be}} located. Brigadier General Wilhelm D. Styer recommended that the different manufacturing facilities be built at the same site in order to simplify security and construction. Such a site would require a substantial tract of land to accommodate both the facilities and housing for the thousands of workers.

The helmet was worn with the lion for normal service, which was replaced by a white horsehair plume on full dress occasions.

Under her husband's guidance, Emily studied higher mathematics, the calculations of catenary curves, the strengths of materials, bridge specifications, and the intricacies of cable construction. She spent the next 11 years assisting Washington Roebling, helping to supervise the bridge's construction.

Once he had decided upon making deeper cuts than he promised, Chrétien proved to <b>be</b> <b>firm</b> supporter of the new course, and supported Martin's cuts to other departments despite the complaints of the other ministers. Chrétien's advisor Eddie Goldenberg later recalled that Chrétien was unyielding {{in the face of}} efforts by other ministers to [...] "spare" [...] their departments, and that Chrétien kept on saying [...] "If I change anything, everything will unravel". In a 2011 interview, Chrétien recalled about the 1995 budget that: [...] "There would have been a day when we would have been the Greece of today. I knew we were in a bind and we had to do something." [...] In order to silence objections from left-wing Liberal backbenchers and Cabinet ministers, Chrétien ensured that the Program Review Committee chaired by Marcel Massé that would decide what programs to end and which to cut had a majority comprising the leftist MPs Brian Tobin, Sheila Copps, Sergio Marchi and Herb Gray, people who would not normally supporting cutting programs, and thereby underlined the seriousness of the crisis. It was only with the budget that Martin introduced on February 27, 1995, that the Chrétien government began a policy of cuts designed to eliminate the deficit in order to reassure the markets.|$|E
2500|$|The modern English word druid {{derives from}} the Latin druides (pronounced [...] ), which was {{considered}} by ancient Roman writers {{to come from the}} native Celtic Gaulish word for these figures. Other Roman texts also employ the form druidae, while the same term was used by Greek ethnographers as [...] (druidēs). Although no extant Romano-Celtic inscription is known to contain the form, the word is cognate with the later insular Celtic words, Old Irish druí ‘druid, sorcerer’, Old Cornish druw, Middle Welsh dryw ‘seer; wren’. Based on all available forms, the hypothetical proto-Celtic word may then be reconstructed as *dru-wid-s (pl. *druwides) meaning [...] "oak-knower". The two elements go back to the Proto-Indo-European roots *deru-'deru-, a cognate to English tree, is the word for [...] "oak", though the root has a wider array of meanings related to [...] "to <b>be</b> <b>firm,</b> solid, steadfast" [...] (whence e.g. English true). The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. Fourth Edition, 2000 [...] and *weid- [...] "to see". The sense of [...] "oak-knower" [...] or [...] "oak-seer" [...] is supported by Pliny the Elder, who in his Natural History considered the word to contain the Greek noun drýs (δρύς), [...] "oak-tree" [...] and the Greek suffix -idēs (-ιδης). Both Old Irish druí and Middle Welsh dryw could also refer to the wren, possibly connected with an association of that bird with augury in Irish and Welsh tradition (see also Wren Day).|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{tried to}} hire an {{overseer}} to handle the plantation in his absence, writing to his cousin, [...] "I wish to get an energetic honest farmer, who while he will be considerate & kind to the negroes, will <b>be</b> <b>firm</b> & make them do their duty." [...] But Lee failed to find a man for the job, and {{had to take a}} two-year leave of absence from the army in order to run the plantation himself. He found the experience frustrating, since many of the slaves had been given to understand that they were to be made free as soon as Custis died, and protested angrily at the delay. In May 1858, Lee wrote to his son Rooney, [...] "I have had some trouble with some of the people. Reuben, Parks & Edward, {{in the beginning of the}} previous week, rebelled against my authority—refused to obey my orders, & said they were as free as I was, etc., etc.—I succeeded in capturing them & lodging them in jail. They resisted till overpowered & called upon the other people to rescue them." [...] Less than two months after they were sent to the Alexandria jail, Lee decided to remove these three men and three female house slaves from Arlington, and sent them under lock and key to the slave-trader William Overton Winston in Richmond, who was instructed to keep them in jail until he could find [...] "good & responsible" [...] slaveholders to work them until the end of the five-year period.|$|E
