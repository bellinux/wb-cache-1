The only exception I have to have an abortion is in that case {{of the life of the}} mother. I just struggled with it myself for a long time but I came to realize: Life is that gift from God that I think even if life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.|$|E
25|$|I yield {{neither to}} Senator Borah nor {{to any other}} man in admiration of the Farewell Address and of the great Fathers of the Republic; but I would not use them as a cover for party politics. Never did I sneer at the Farewell Address; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that the greatness of Washington was due to his looking the facts of his day in the face, and {{determining}} his conduct thereby, instead of by utterances, however wise of {{a hundred and fifty}} years before. I will trust the American people not to mistake short-sightedness for patriotism or narrow-mindedness for love of country.|$|E

Do not expect the possibility of truce or of Portuguese prisoners, as there will be no surrender rendered because I feel that our soldiers and sailors can be either victorious or dead. These words could, by their seriousness, be directed only to a soldier of higher duties fully prepared to fulfill them. God will not allow you to be the last Governor of the State of India.|$|E
500|$|The {{area was}} named after Scarborough, Yorkshire, England by Elizabeth Simcoe, the wife of John Graves Simcoe, the first {{lieutenant}} governor of Upper Canada. The bluffs along Scarborough's Lake Ontario shores {{reminded her of the}} limestone cliffs in Scarborough, England. On August 4, 1793, she wrote in her diary, [...] "The shore is extremely bold, and has the appearance of chalk cliffs, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> they are only white sand. They appeared so well that we talked of building a summer residence there and calling it Scarborough." [...] Before that, the area was named Glasgow, after the Scottish city.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of Bryan's message, Hanna was convinced the Democrat's support would recede. [...] "He's talking Silver all the time, and that's where we've got him", Hanna stated, pounding his desk, in July. [...] He proved correct; the silver enthusiasm waned by September and Bryan had no ready replacement for it. [...] McKinley, {{on the other}} hand, convinced that his [...] "sound money" [...] campaign had worked, began to promote his tariff issue, stating to the crowds on his front lawn, [...] "I {{do not know what}} you think about it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> it is a good deal better to open the mills of the United States to the labor of America than to open the mints of the United States to the silver of the world." ...|$|E

500|$|After such criticism, Linnaeus felt {{he needed}} to explain himself more clearly. The 10th edition of [...] {{introduced}} new terms, including Mammalia and Primates, the latter of which would replace Anthropomorpha as well as giving humans the full binomial Homo sapiens. The new classification received less criticism, but many natural historians still believed he had demoted humans from their former place of ruling over nature and not {{being a part of}} it. Linnaeus believed that man biologically belongs to the animal kingdom and had to be included in it. In his book , he said, [...] "One should not vent one's wrath on animals, Theology decree that man has a soul and that the animals are mere 'aoutomata mechanica,' <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> they would be better advised that animals have a soul and that the difference is of nobility." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{dramatic}} debate with Frederick Douglass at the AERA convention in 1869, Stone argued that suffrage for women {{was more important}} than suffrage for African Americans. She nevertheless supported the amendment, saying, [...] "But I thank God for that XV. Amendment, and hope that it will be adopted in every State. I will be thankful in my soul if any body can get out of the terrible pit. [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that the safety of the government would be more promoted by the admission of woman as an element of restoration and harmony than the negro." [...] Stone and her allies expected that their active support for the amendment to enfranchise black men would lead their abolitionist friends in Congress to push for an amendment to enfranchise women as the next step, but that did not happen.|$|E
500|$|During the evening, Elliot and Smith {{discussed}} {{destroying the}} three junks and deploying men {{to attack the}} battery the next day, but Smith acceded to Elliot's recommendation not to do so. Elliot stated that an attack would destroy the village and cause [...] "great injury and irritation" [...] to the inhabitants. In a letter to trader James Matheson on 5 September, Elliot felt {{that it would be}} unbecoming of a British warship to shoot to death the Chinese junks, which his [...] "poor Cutter" [...] could do under their batteries. He wrote: [...] "Perhaps I ought not to have fired at all but every man's patience has limits and mine has been sorely tried. I am afraid I have disappointed the men's ardent spirits here <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> I have done well to refrain." [...] He circulated a paper on shore the same day which stated: ...|$|E

500|$|Although Crane {{once wrote}} in a letter, [...] "You can tell nothing... unless you are in that {{condition}} yourself," [...] he wrote The Red Badge of Courage without any experience of war. He would, however, later serve as a war correspondent during the Greco-Turkish and Spanish–American Wars. Nevertheless, the realistic portrayal of the battlefield in The Red Badge of Courage has often misled readers into thinking that Crane (despite being born six {{years after the end}} of the Civil War) was himself a veteran. While trying to explain his ability to write about battle realistically, Crane stated: [...] "Of course, I have never been in a battle, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that I got my sense of the rage of conflict on the football field, or else fighting is a hereditary instinct, and I wrote intuitively; for the Cranes were a family of fighters in the old days".|$|E
500|$|Stockhausen, {{along with}} John Cage, {{is one of}} the few avant-garde composers to have succeeded in {{penetrating}} the popular consciousness ( [...] ; [...] ). The Beatles included his face on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band [...] This reflects his influence on the band's own avant-garde experiments as well as the general fame and notoriety he had achieved by that time (1967). In particular, [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] (1967) and [...] "Revolution 9" [...] (1968) were influenced by Stockhausen's electronic music ( [...] ; [...] ). Stockhausen's name, and the perceived strangeness and supposed unlistenability of his music, was even a punchline in cartoons, as documented on a page on the official Stockhausen web site (...) [...] Perhaps the most caustic remark about Stockhausen was attributed to Sir Thomas Beecham. Asked [...] "Have you heard any Stockhausen?", he is alleged to have replied, [...] "No, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> I have trodden in some" [...] ( [...] , annotated on 366: [...] "Apocryphal; source unknown").|$|E
500|$|Early on, Young {{established}} himself {{as one of the}} harder-throwing pitchers in the game. Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his baseball glove to protect his catching hand from Young's fastball. In the absence of radar guns, however, it is impossible to say just how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On {{the last day of the}} season, Young won both games of a doubleheader. In the first weeks of Young's career, Cap Anson, the player-manager of the Chicago Colts spotted Young's ability. Anson told Spiders' manager Gus Schmelz, [...] "He's too green to do your club much good, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> if I taught him what I know, I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years. He's not worth it now, but I'm willing to give you $1,000 ($ today) for him." [...] Schmelz replied, [...] "Cap, you can keep your thousand and we'll keep the rube." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 2015, Ron Paul ended all {{relationships}} with the Voices of Liberty and the Ron Paul Channel {{to start a new}} internet broadcast called the Ron Paul Liberty Report. According to Paul himself, it will not cost a thing, unlike the previous Ron Paul Channel. In the announcement of the ended relationship, Paul said, [...] "But the message I have always tried to deliver over the years has always been the same, and that is spreading the message of liberty. Right now I am very much engaged in doing that through the internet. <b>But,</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> we can do better. Right now, the program has changed to the Ron Paul Liberty Report, {{and that is what we}} do, we report on liberty in context of what is going on in daily activity and what is going on in the news." [...] Paul went on to say that it will be more locally controlled, unlike the previous Ron Paul Channel. Paul continued to say it will be produced out of Texas, instead of California.|$|E
500|$|Hill set a {{provisional}} pole position time of 1:20.081 {{during the first}} qualifying session, ahead of Berger, Coulthard, Alesi, Häkkinen and Schumacher. The session was disrupted after Schumacher crashed heavily into the tyre barrier at turneight, a corner normally taken at a speed of [...] As a precaution, Benetton opted to keep Schumacher's teammate, Johnny Herbert, in the garage while the team found out {{what was wrong with}} the car. This meant that Herbert did not set a time in the session, while Schumacher completed only two of his twelve allotted laps. Speaking of the incident, Schumacher said that [...] "there was a little movement in the steering wheel at the previous corner and at the next it went completely. I spun the car backwards into the tyre barrier and the safety structure behind my head {{did a good job of}} protecting me. For sure I am not very happy about this, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that the team will spend a lot of time investigating the situation for tomorrow and they will find the problem." [...] The problem was determined to be a steering failure, specifically a joint in the car's steering column. Replacement steering components were sourced from São Paulo by Benetton engineer Tim Wright, and the team did not encounter any problems over the remainder of the weekend.|$|E
