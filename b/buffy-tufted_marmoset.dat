50|$|Little {{is known}} about the <b>buffy-tufted</b> <b>marmoset</b> {{reproductive}} patterns. Gestation is approximately 170 days and births are typically of twin offspring.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{most other}} marmosets, the <b>buffy-tufted</b> <b>marmoset</b> almost {{exclusively}} eats insects. It does not eat tree sap, {{which is why}} it has a very small snout.|$|E
50|$|The <b>buffy-tufted</b> <b>marmoset</b> {{lives in}} coastal forests from sea-level up to 500 m. It is diurnal and arboreal, living almost all its {{life in the}} trees. It lives in small groups of two to eight animals.|$|E
50|$|Many mammals eat fungi, {{but only}} a few feed {{exclusively}} on fungi, most are opportunistic feeders and fungi only make up part of their diet. At least 22 species of primate, including humans, bonobos, colobines, gorillas, lemurs, macaques, mangabeys, marmosets and vervet monkeys are known to feed on fungi. Most of these species spend less than 5% of the time they spend feeding, eating fungi and they therefore form {{only a small part of}} their diet. Some species spend longer foraging for fungi and they account for a greater part of their diet; <b>buffy-tufted</b> <b>marmosets</b> spend up to 12% of their time consuming sporocarps, Goeldi’s monkeys spend up to 63% of their time doing so and the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey spends up to 95% of its feeding time eating lichens. Fungi are comparatively very rare in tropical rainforests compared to other food sources such as fruit and leaves and they are also distributed more sparsely and appear unpredictably, making them a challenging source of food for Goeldi’s monkeys.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>buffy-tufted</b> <b>{{marmoset}}</b> {{resembles the}} common marmoset but is somewhat larger. It has grey-black skin, {{and the most}} obvious differences from the common marmoset are its whitish face ("skulllike facial mask" [...] ), brown crown and shorter ear tufts.|$|E
50|$|The <b>buffy-tufted</b> <b>{{marmoset}}</b> (Callithrix aurita), {{also known}} as the buffy tufted-ear marmoset or white-eared marmoset, is a New World monkey that lives in the forests on the Atlantic coast of southeast Brazil. Of all the marmosets, it has the southernmost range.|$|E
50|$|The park is an {{important}} refuge for several species of amphibians, mammals and birds.There are 22 species of mammals.Primates include howler monkeys, titis, micos and robust capuchin monkeys.There are ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), coatis, armadillos and southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla).There are also Brazilian squirrel (Sciurus aestuans), tapeti (Sylvilagus brasiliensis), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), cougar (Puma concolor) and <b>buffy-tufted</b> <b>marmoset</b> (Callithrix aurita).|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} {{is in the}} Atlantic Forest biome, with dense high montane, montane and low montane rainforest.In the lower, warmer {{slopes of}} the Paraíba Valley there is semi-deciduous forest with cerrado enclaves.Cerrado species include Alibertia elliptica, Cupania oblongifolia and Miconia ferruginata.Endemic species of fauna include <b>buffy-tufted</b> <b>marmoset</b> (Callithrix aurita), white-bearded antshrike (Biatas nigropectus), brown-backed parrotlet (Touit melanonotus) and vinaceous-breasted amazon (Amazona vinacea).|$|E
50|$|The region {{includes}} an important {{remnant of the}} Atlantic Forest biome including the various transitions from coastal mangroves to humid tropical forest on the hillsides.Protected species include southern muriqui (Brachyteles arachnoides), <b>buffy-tufted</b> <b>marmoset</b> (Callithrix aurita), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), sea ginger coral (Millepora alcicornis), catfish (Trichogenes longipinnis), black-capped piprites (Piprites pileata), white-necked hawk (Leucopternis lacernulatus), brown-backed parrotlet (Touit melanonotus) and Chaco eagle (Harpyhaliaetus coronatus).|$|E
50|$|The {{terrain is}} mostly rugged, with altitudes {{that range from}} 191 to 1892 m.The climate is wet, with average annual {{rainfall}} of 1500 to 2000 mm.September is the driest month and December is the wettest.Vegetation is montane or submontane rainforest.Fauna found in the APA include the white-bearded antshrike (Biatas nigropectus), sloth, cougar (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), <b>buffy-tufted</b> <b>marmoset</b> (Callithrix aurita), hawk, falcon, toucan, howler monkey, capybara, paca, armadillo, common agouti, jaguarundi and deer.|$|E
50|$|The common {{marmoset}} (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World monkey. It originally {{lived on}} the northeastern coast of Brazil, in the states of Piaui, Paraiba, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco, Alagoas and Bahia. Through release (both intentional and unintentional) of captive individuals, it has expanded its range since the 1920s to Southeast Brazil (its first sighting in the wild for Rio de Janeiro was in 1929) and became there an invasive species, raising concerns about genetic pollution of similar species, such as the <b>buffy-tufted</b> <b>marmoset</b> (Callithrix aurita), and predation upon bird nestlings and eggs.|$|E
