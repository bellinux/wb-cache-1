5|$|By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put {{the serial}} into {{production}} and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, “Compassionate Leave”, depicting Craven's reaction to Emma's death, describing them as “the most sustained evocation of individual grief in bereavement that I can remember”. The budget was set at £2 million, of which £400,000 came from an American co-producer, Lionheart Television International. Director Martin Campbell came on board shortly afterwards and soon clashed with Troy Kennedy Martin, demanding rewrites, in particular {{to the notion that}} Craven had known about Emma's involvement with GAIA right from the start; this was removed at Campbell's behest. Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character would turn into a tree; Peck recalled that “it didn't seem to be working in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> work for the audience”, a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was “likely not to come off as an effect”. Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements of Kennedy Martin's original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, “Burden of Proof”, the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, like a tree.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{there were}} some doubts as to whether Sakuraba would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> into {{the next round of}} the Hero's tournament based on the {{severity}} of the damage he endured against Smirnovas. However, Sakuraba reported that a follow-up CAT scan had found no irregularities and was then slated to face one-time Olympic judoka, Yoshihiro Akiyama in the tournament's semi-finals on October 9 in what K-1 hoped would be a high revenue match-up. The winner of that bout was to face the victor between Melvin Manhoef and Shungo Oyama to determine a tournament champion. However, during a hard sparring session for the upcoming bout Sakuraba began vomiting and fainted. After being rushed to the hospital he was diagnosed with vertebrobasilar damage that restricted blood circulation to the head and neck area. The doctors determined the damage was caused from years of untreated head injuries dating back to his college years.|$|E

500|$|In January 2017, Sounders' coach Brian Schmetzer told Geoff Baker of The Seattle Times that Steve Zakuani {{had been}} {{training}} {{with the team}} for some time: [...] "He was asked whether Zakuani’s status fell somewhere between a 'trial' with the Sounders and just pure training. 'I would say that’s fair,' he replied."

2500|$|Although the {{suspects}} (except Salaam) had confessed on videotape {{in the presence}} of a parent or guardian, they retracted their statements within weeks, claiming that they had been intimidated, lied to, and coerced into making false confessions. The detectives had indeed used ruses to convince {{the suspects}} to confess, with Salaam confessing to having been present only after he was told that fingerprints were found on the victim's clothing. According to Salaam, [...] "I would hear them beating up Korey Wise in the next room", and [...] "they would come and look at me and say: 'You realise you're next.' The fear made me feel really like I was not going to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> out." [...] While the confessions themselves were videotaped, the hours of interrogation that preceded the confessions were not.|$|E
2500|$|As with {{previous}} Sega Genesis Sonic games, Sonic 3D Blast includes [...] "special stages", {{in which the}} player collects Chaos Emeralds. Obtaining all seven Emeralds allows the player to play the final boss battle and discover the true ending of the game. To access these stages, the player must find one of Sonic's friends (either Tails or Knuckles the Echidna) hidden within a level, and stand next to them with at least 50 rings collected. Doing so allows the player to exchange the rings {{in order for the}} chance to play the game's special stage. These levels follow the same basic premise as Sonic the Hedgehog 2s special stages; the camera shifts to behind Sonic as he runs down a preset path and must collect rings while avoiding obstacles that, when run into, make him lose rings. A certain number of rings need to be obtained at certain checkpoints to continue through the stage, and ultimately <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to the end in order to receive a Chaos Emerald. If all seven Chaos Emeralds are collected, the Special Stages can still be played for extra lives. Collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds {{is the only way to}} reach the [...] "Final Fight" [...] level, consisting of the final boss fight and the good ending of the game.|$|E
