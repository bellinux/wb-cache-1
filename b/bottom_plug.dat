50|$|A {{rubber plug}} used to {{separate}} the cement slurry from other fluids, reducing contamination and maintaining predictable slurry performance. Two types of cementing plug are typically used on a cementing operation. The <b>bottom</b> <b>plug</b> is launched ahead of the cement slurry to minimize contamination by fluids inside the casing prior to cementing. A diaphragm in the plug body ruptures to allow the cement slurry to pass through after the plug reaches the landing collar. The top plug has a solid body that provides positive indication of contact with the landing collar and <b>bottom</b> <b>plug</b> through an increase in pump pressure.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydrostatic}} bailer functions like a 'vacuum', {{and is used}} to suck up unwanted solids {{from the}} wellbore. A hydrostatic bailer is generally around 2.5 meters long and is tubular looking, with two 10 mm holes on opposing sides {{at the top of}} the tool, and a hole in the bottom. A hydrostatic bailer uses a pinned plug with o-ring seals at the bottom, and a plug at the top to maintain the surface pressure that it was assembled at (nominally around 100 kPa) all the way to the bottom of the well, whereupon it is spudded into the downhole solids, which ideally pushes the shoe into the <b>bottom</b> <b>plug,</b> which shears the pin on the <b>bottom</b> <b>plug.</b> An oil or gas well's pressure downhole is always more than atmospheric pressure at surface, due to the formation pressure, and a combination of depth and hydrostatic weight of wellbore fluids. Sometimes fluid will be added to the wellbore to assist in bailing by bringing up the pressure, and also lubricating the downhole solid. Because the pressure inside the bailer is much less than the downhole wellbore pressure, any solids that are loose enough are 'sucked up' by the vacuum formed when the <b>bottom</b> <b>plug</b> is sheared and travels upwards through the barrel, followed by the solids. At the same time, due to the changed from negative pressure to positive pressure, the top plug pops out (and is caught by the top part of the tool), and excess flow is directed out through the 10 mm ports on the sides of the top of the tool. These ports allow the barrel to fill more readily. Then the bailer is returned to surface where it is taken apart, the solids are emptied, and it is cleaned and serviced with new o-ring seals. Care must be taken when disassembling at surface as the tool is potentially charged with the downhole pressure (possibly many tens of thousands of kpa) and may 'blow apart' when being unthreaded if not bled off first.|$|E

Two sizes of chemically pruned seedlings were treated with a copper based paint (PCT 5 - 12 and PCT 4 - 10). The other treatments were containerized Styroblock (PSB) 4 - 15 seedling that were knife pruned in four ways (i. e. <b>bottom</b> <b>plug</b> removal = RPB, <b>bottom</b> <b>plug</b> removal and two lateral cuts = RPB+ 2, and lateral cutting with three cuts = RP 3 and six cuts = RP 6). Growths of pruned seedlings were compared to the un-pruned PSB 4 - 15 control group. While site soil conditions {{proved to be a}} stronger contributing factor to growth, pruning treatments induced different effects on seedlings particularly in root development. Root counts, root symmetry and proportion of direct large roots, showed greatest improvements. Root pruned seedlings also had better distribution of root growth throughout the plug. Among knife pruning treatments, lateral cutting methods were more favourable to early root growth with greater root counts after a twenty-one day period than <b>bottom</b> <b>plug</b> removal. The most extreme knife pruning treatment, consisting of six laterial cuts (RP 6), had a mean of 60 % removal of roots within the plug and showed no differences in height growth regardless of site. Also the RP 6 seedlings had 100 % survival. It shows that the PSB 4 - 15 seedling is to a great extent resilient to knife pruning, which should be encouraged where chemical root pruning is less useful as it improves rooting development in the early establishment of confer seedlings. Improved rooting establishment of planted seedlings may result to better adaptation to environmental conditions and competitive stresses, as well as improve stem morphology and long-term growth.

40|$|Jet {{grouting}} {{is adopted}} in different geotechnical conditions to ensure provisional earth retaining and waterproofing functions {{at the bottom}} and walls of excavations. Despite careful theoretical models avail-able to predict the mechanical response of these structures, design is often carried out without adequate con-trol, i. e. by assuming ideal effectiveness of ground improvement. On the contrary, adverse effects have been documented by past experiences which {{can be traced back to}} erroneous prediction of treatments effects, inac-curate control of the execution or to unexpected responses of the surrounding environment. All these uncertainties, which become particularly critical when excavation is performed in urbanized areas, can be mini-mized by detailed preliminary field trials, accurate controls of the execution of treatments and a prompt monitoring of the surrounding area.

Numerical simulation technology could be one of the most effective assessment methods. In order to have confidence in the prediction of the coupled hydraulic and mechanical processes occurring within the engineered clay barrier, a comparison between calculated and observed results is essential for validation and verification. For this purpose, a new Hydro-Mechanical (HM) device was designed in this paper, in which compacted GMZ 01 bentonite specimen was embedded into a hollow Beishan granite column, which was tightly fixed by a closure metal framework. Relative humidity and pressure sensors were employed for monitoring behavior of the compacted bentonite during hydration, in order to observe the HM coupling performance of the compacted bentonite with consideration of influences of surrounding rocks at room temperature. The newly-developed test device includes three parts, a <b>bottom</b> <b>plug,</b> a cylindrical metal cell body and a top plug, which were tightly fixed together with four screws to form a confined (constant volume) closure system. Relative humidity and pressure sensors were implemented. Relative humidity sensors were calibrated before installation.

40|$|An {{underground}} {{nuclear test}} named Gasbuggy {{was conducted in}} northwestern New Mexico in 1967. Subsequent groundwater monitoring in an overlying aquifer by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency revealed increasing levels of tritium in monitoring well EPNG 10 - 36, located 132 m from the test, suggesting migration of contaminants from the nuclear cavity. There are three basic scenarios that could explain the occurrence of tritium in well 10 - 36 : (1) introduction of tritium into the well from the land surface, (2) migration of tritium through the Ojo Alamo Formation, and (3) migration through the Pictured Cliffs Formation. The two subsurface transport scenarios were evaluated with a travel time analysis. In one, transport occurs to the Ojo Alamo sandstone either up the emplacement hole or through fractures created by the blast, and then laterally through the aquifer to the monitoring well. In the other, lateral transport occurs through fractures in the underlying Pictured Cliffs detonation horizon and then migrates up the monitoring well through plugged casing connecting the two formations. The travel time analysis indicates that the hydraulic conductivity measured in the Ojo Alamo Formation is too low for lateral transport {{to account for the}} observed arrival of tritium at the monitoring well. This suggests transport either through fractures intersecting the Ojo Alamo close to well EPNG 10 - 36, or through fractures in the Pictured Cliffs and up through the <b>bottom</b> <b>plug</b> in the well.

40|$|Linear {{stability}} {{theory and}} bifurcation analysis {{are used to}} investigate the role of gravity in shear-band formation in granular Couette flow, considering a kinetic-theory rheological model. We show that the only possible state, at low shear rates, corresponds to a 'plug' near the bottom wall, in which the particles are densely packed and the shear rate is close to zero, and a uniformly sheared dilute region above it. The origin of such plugged states is shown to be tied to the spontaneous symmetry-breaking instabilities of the gravity-free uniform shear flow, leading {{to the formation of}} ordered bands of alternating dilute and dense regions in the transverse direction, via an infinite hierarchy of pitchfork bifurcations. Gravity plays the role of an 'imperfection', thus destroying the 'perfect' bifurcation structure of uniform shear. The present bifurcation problem admits universal unfolding of pitchfork bifurcations which subsequently leads to the formation of a sequence of a countably infinite number of 'isolas', with the solution structures being a modulated version of their gravity-free counterpart. While the solution with a plug near the bottom wall looks remarkably similar to the shear-banding phenomenon in dense slow granular Couette flows, a 'floating' plug near the top wall is also a solution of these equations at high shear rates. A two-dimensional linear stability analysis suggests that these floating plugged states are unstable to long-wave travelling disturbances. The unique solution having a <b>bottom</b> <b>plug</b> can also be unstable to long waves, but remains stable at sufficiently low shear rates. The implications and realizability of the present results are discussed in the light of shear-cell experiments under 'microgravity'conditions...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: One of {{the primary}} tasks that put the steel {{producers}} to the test is to reduce production costs while maintaining high quality. This objective is achieved among others through the optimization of conducted technological processes. Commonly used technology of steel homogenization with inert gases is an important stage {{in the production of}} steel in which that objective can be accomplished. Design/methodology/approach: Tests of hydrodynamic processes occurring during the steel blowing with inert gases process directly in industrial conditions is very difficult or impossible. Therefore, as the primary research method physical modelling was used. In order to carry out the tests described in the article a physical model of the station for the argon purging was used that is working at the VSB-TU, Department of Metallurgy and Foundry in Ostrava. Findings: As a result the study provided values for the investigated process and determined the appropriate location of the gas-permeable fittings in steelmaking ladle’s <b>bottom</b> <b>plug.</b> This allows to obtain the required conditions for the steel mixing in the entire volume of ladle’s workspace.
