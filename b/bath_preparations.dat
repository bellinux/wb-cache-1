40|$|We {{formulate}} exact generalized nonequilibrium fluctuation {{relations for}} the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator coupled to multiple harmonic baths. Each of the different baths is prepared in its own individual (in general nonthermal) state. Starting from the exact solution for the oscillator dynamics we study fluctuations of the oscillator position {{as well as of}} the energy current through the oscillator under general nonequilibrium conditions. In particular, we formulate a fluctuation-dissipation relation for the oscillator position autocorrelation function that generalizes the standard result for the case of a single bath at thermal equilibrium. Moreover, we show that the generating function for the position operator fullfills a generalized Gallavotti-Cohen-like relation. For the energy transfer through the oscillator, we determine the average energy current together with the current fluctuations. Finally, we discuss the generalization of the cumulant generating function for the energy transfer to nonthermal <b>bath</b> <b>preparations.</b> Comment: 21 page...|$|E
40|$|Using {{the exact}} path {{integral}} {{solution for the}} damped harmonic oscillator it is shown that in general there does not exist an exact dissipative Liouville operator describing {{the dynamics of the}} oscillator for arbitrary initial <b>bath</b> <b>preparations.</b> Exact non-stationary Liouville operators can be found only for particular preparations. Three physically meaningful examples are examined. An exact new master equation is derived for thermal initial conditions. Second, the Liouville operator governing the time-evolution of equilibrium correlations is obtained. Third, factorizing initial conditions are studied. Additionally, one can show that there are approximate Liouville operators independent of the initial preparation describing the long time dynamics under appropriate conditions. The general form of these approximate master equations is derived and the coefficients are determined for special cases of the bath spectral density including the Ohmic, Drude and weak coupling cases. The connection with earlier work is discussed. Comment: to be published in Phys. Rev. ...|$|E

For {{application in}} the hydrocarbon field, priority was the development of machine technology. As groundwork for this, cleaning drying and treatment tests were carried out, which proved that the oil load is the decisive factor for the cleaning result. The drying is carried out by vacuum or by a combination of vacuum and condensation. At the present time vacuum distillation is used as treatment method. In order to keep emissions low, closed circuit machine concepts with recirculated air operation and desaturation by condensation were realized, as well as machines with exhaust air in which the desaturation is also done by condensation, and in addition by activated carbon adsorption.

The results of ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-Vis) and electrodeposition showed that active Cr(III) complexes in the bath prepared at room temperature in several days were rare for depositing chromium. The increase of heating temperature, time, and pH value during the <b>bath</b> <b>preparation</b> promoted the formation of active Cr(III) complexes. The chromium deposition rate increased with the concentration of active Cr(III) complexes increasing. Increasing the heating temperature from 60 to 96 A degrees C, the chromium deposition rate increased from 0. 40 to 0. 71 mu m/min. When the concentration of active Cr(III) complexes increased, the grain size of Cr coatings increased, and the carbon content of the coating decreased.

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was aimed to assess the {{contractile}} status of neonatal small intestinal smooth muscle of dilated pre-atretic part of intestinal atresia to resolve debatable issues related to mechanisms of persistent dysmotility after surgical repair. Materials and Methods: A total of 34 longitudinally sectioned strips were prepared from pre-atretic dilated part of freshly excised 8 jejunal atresia type III a cases. Spontaneous as well as acetylcholine- and histamine-induced contractions were recorded in vitro by using organ <b>bath</b> <b>preparations.</b> Chemically evoked contractions were further evaluated after application of atropine (muscarinic blocker), pheniramine (H 1 blocker), and lignocaine (neuronal blocker) to ascertain receptors and neuronal involvement. Histological examinations of strips were made by using Masson trichrome stain to assess the fibrotic changes. Results: All 34 strips, except four showed spontaneous contractions with mean frequency and amplitude of 5. 49 ± 0. 26 /min and 24. 41 ± 5. 26 g/g wet tissue respectively. The response to ACh was nearly twice as compared to histamine for equimolar concentrations (100 μM). ACh (100 μM) induced contractions were attenuated (by 60 %) by atropine. Histamine (100 μM) -induced contractions was blocked by pheniramine (0. 32 μM) and lignocaine (4 μM) by 74 % and 78 %, respectively. Histopathological examination showed varying degree of fibrotic changes in muscle layers. Conclusions: Pre-atretic dilated part of jejunal atresia retains functional activity but with definitive histopathologic abnormalities. It is suggested that excision of a length of pre-atretic part and early stimulation of peristalsis by locally acting cholinomimetic or H 1 agonist may help in reducing postoperative motility problems in atresia patients...|$|E
40|$|This project {{identified}} a novel family of six 66 - 68 residue peptides from the venom of two Australian funnel-web spiders, Hadronyche sp. 20 and H. infensa: Orchid Beach (Hexathelidae: Atracinae), {{that appear to}} undergo N- and/or C-terminal post-translational modifications and conform to an ancestral protein fold. These peptides all show significant amino acid sequence homology to atracotoxin-Hvf 17 (ACTX-Hvf 17), a non-toxic peptide isolated from the venom of H. versuta, {{and a variety of}} AVIT family proteins including mamba intestinal toxin 1 (MIT 1) and its mammalian and piscine orthologs prokineticin 1 (PK 1) and prokineticin 2 (PK 2). These AVIT family proteins target prokineticin receptors involved in the sensitization of nociceptors and gastrointestinal smooth muscle activation. Given their sequence homology to MIT 1, we have named these spider venom peptides the MIT-like atracotoxin (ACTX) family. Using isolated rat stomach fundus or guinea-pig ileum organ <b>bath</b> <b>preparations</b> we have shown that the prototypical ACTX-Hvf 17, at concentrations up to 1 muM, did not stimulate smooth muscle contractility, nor did it inhibit contractions induced by human PK 1 (hPK 1). The peptide also lacked activity on other isolated smooth muscle preparations including rat aorta. Furthermore, a FLIPR Ca 2 + flux assay using HEK 293 cells expressing prokineticin receptors showed that ACTX-Hvf 17 fails to activate or block hPK 1 or hPK 2 receptors. Therefore, while the MIT-like ACTX family appears to adopt the ancestral disulfide-directed beta-hairpin protein fold of MIT 1, a motif believed to be shared by other AVIT family peptides, variations in the amino acid sequence and surface charge result in a loss of activity on prokineticin receptors...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to isolate the active compound from the rhizome of C. zedoaroides, to determine its structure and to assess its antagonistic activity in vitro and in vivo against King cobra venom. Methods The active compound was obtained from C. zedoaroides by extraction with acetone followed by purification using column chromatography; its X-ray structure was determined. Its inhibition of venom lethality was studied in vitro in rat phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragms and in vivo in mice. Key findings The acetone extract of the Curcuma rhizomes contained a C 20 dialdehyde, [2 -(5, 5, 8 a-trimethyl- 2 -methylene-decahydro-naphthalen- 1 -yl) -ethylidene] -succinaldehyde, as the major component. The isolated curcuma dialdehyde was found active in vitro and in vivo for antivenin activity against the King cobra venom. Using isolated rat phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparations, a significant antagonistic effect on the inhibition of neuromuscular transmission was observed in vitro. Inhibition on muscle contraction, produced by the 4 μg/ml venom, was reversed by 2 - 16 μg/ml of Curcuma dialdehyde in organ <b>bath</b> <b>preparations</b> over a period of 2 h. Mice intraperitoneally injected with 0. 75 mg/kg venom and dialdehyde at 100 mg/kg had a significantly increased survival time. Injection of Curcuma dialdehyde (100 mg/kg) 30 min before the subcutaneous injection of the venom resulted in a 100 % survival time after 2 h compared with 0 % for the control group. Conclusions The in vitro and in vivo evaluation confirmed the medicinal use of traditional snake plants against snakebites. The bioactivity is linked to an isolated molecule and not a result of synergistic effects of a mixture. The active compound was isolated and the structure fully elucidated, including its stereochemistry.

In vitro animal studies have implicated inhibition of release of the endothelium derived relaxing factor, nitric oxide; however, this has not been investigated in human tissue. The present study investigated the effect of cyclosporin A on nitric oxide release in human coronary arteries. DESIGN [...] Study of in vitro organ <b>bath</b> <b>preparations</b> and in vivo angiographic measurements in the coronary circulation. PATIENTS [...] For the in vitro experiments coronary arteries were harvested from the excised hearts of 10 patients requiring transplantation for reasons other than ischaemic heart disease. Three of these patients were being re-transplanted for obliterative bronchiolitis and had been receiving cyclosporin for a mean of 22 months. The in vivo study was performed on a group of 12 cardiac transplant recipients who were clinically well 1 - 5 years postoperatively and were not undergoing allograft rejection at the time of assessment. RESULTS [...] Isolated vessel segments in vitro relaxed in a dose dependent manner in response to substance P (10 (- 11) - 10 (- 7) mol/l). The maximum response was 76. 6 (7. 4) % of the response to 1 microgram/ml glyceryl trinitrate. Incubation with 1000 and 2000 ng/ml cyclosporin reduced the response to 63. 0 (11. 5) % and 62. 2 (11. 1) % respectively; this was not statistically significant. In segments taken from the explanted hearts of three patients requiring re-transplantation, the mean maximum response was 78. 0 (11. 0) % and there was no correlation between maximum response in segments from each patient and the duration of cyclosporin therapy. The effect of intracoronary substance P in 12 cardiac transplant recipients was also examined (mean cyclosporin blood concentration 228. 9 (42. 8) ng/ml). The mean maximum dilatations measured as the percentage diameter change induced by substance P and isosorbide dinitrate were 22. 1 (3. 2) % and 26. 0 (2. 5) % respectively. There was no correlation between the degree of endothelium mediated vasodilatation in response to substance P and cyclosporin concentration.

We have previously described a model of maternal dietary imbalance in Sprague-Dawley rats whereby administration of a maternal diet rich in animal lard programmes the development of increased blood pressure, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, obesity and mesenteric artery endothelial dysfunction in adult offspring. To further characterize the mechanism of hypertension in this model we have examined vascular and renal structure in adult offspring of Sprague-Dawley rats fed a control diet (OC) or lard-rich diet (OHF) during pregnancy and suckling followed by a control diet post-weaning. To gain further insight, we assessed aortic reactivity and elasticity in an organ <b>bath</b> <b>preparation</b> and renal renin and Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Plasma aldosterone concentration was also measured. Stereological examination of the aorta in OHF demonstrated reduced endothelial cell volume and smooth muscle cell number compared with OC. Adult OHF animals showed increased aortic stiffness and reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation. Renal stereology showed no differences in kidney weight, glomerular number or volume in OHF compared with OC, but renin and Na+,K+-ATPase activity were significantly reduced in OHF compared with controls. Programmed alterations to aortic structure and function are consistent with previous observations that exposure to maternal high fat diets produces systemic vascular changes in the offspring. Despite normal renal stereology, altered renal Na+,K+-ATPase and renin activity offers further insight into the mechanism underlying the increased blood pressure characteristic of this model...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the importance of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced diaphragmatic contractile dysfunction. Many investigators have proposed that iNOS induction in the ventilatory and limb muscles of animals injected with Escherichia coli LPS leads to impaired muscle contractility and increased fatigability. We tested this proposal by examining wild-type mice and iNOS-deficient (iNOS knockout) mice. Both types of mice were injected with either saline (control) or E. coli LPS and killed after 12 h. Diaphragm nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, NOS expression, and muscle contractility were assessed with L-citrulline assay, immunoblotting, and in vitro <b>bath</b> <b>preparation,</b> respectively. LPS injection in wild-type mice induced iNOS protein expression and augmented total diaphragmatic NOS activity, which coincided with impaired muscle force generated at frequencies higher than 30 Hz. In iNOS knockout mice, injection of LPS augmented constitutive muscle NOS activity, upregulated the expression of the neuronal NOS (nNOS), but elicited a significantly greater decline in force generated in response to high frequency of stimulation compared with wild-type animals. We conclude that iNOS may play a protective role in attenuating the inhibitory influence of LPS on muscle contractility. Comtois AS, El-Dwairi Q, Laubach VE, Hussain SNA.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to evaluate the role of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) on micturition. CRF is involved in the endocrine and central nervous system responses to stress and is also expressed in sites responsible for the control of micturition. In this investigation, cystometric experiments were performed in awake and unrestrained Wistar rats and on Spontaneous Hypertensive Rats, which are used as a rodent model of detrusor overactivity and anxiety. In vitro effects of CRF were evaluated using strips of detrusor muscle in an organ <b>bath</b> <b>preparation.</b> CRF (6. 0 mu g) administered via intrathecal and intraperitoneal routes, but not intracerebroventricularly, lowered the micturition threshold. CRF reduced the intercontraction interval by 28 % and 26 % after intrathecal or intraperitoneal administration, respectively, and reduced micturition volume by 34. 7 % and 30. 2 %, respectively. In Wistar-Kyoto rats, 6. 0 mu g intrathecal CRF significantly reduced intercontraction interval (423 +/- 79 vs. 669 +/- 59 s) and micturition volume (0. 30 +/- 0. 04 vs. 0. 69 +/- 0. 07 ml) compared to controls that received saline vehicle. These effects were blocked by pretreatment with 6. 0 mu g intrathecal astressin, a potent CRF antagonist, demonstrating that the effects are CRF receptor mediated. In Spontaneous Hypertensive Rats, 6. 0 mu G intrathecal CRF was found to have minimal stimulatory effects on the bladder, whereas astressin reduced baseline detrusor overactivity. CRF had no direct contractile effects on detrusor muscle strips. These results demonstrate that in the absence of detrusor overactivity, CRE stimulates micturition when administered via the intrathecal or intraperitoneal routes. Further studies are needed to explore the possibility whether CRF antagonists are effective for detrusor overactivity and the overactive bladder syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Subtle {{impairment}} of fetal nutrition appears to predict hypertension and atherosclerosis in adults. It has been hypothesised that impaired aortic elastogenesis is the initiating step in adult hypertension and aortic aneurysms. Vitamin D {{has been shown}} to inhibit elastin synthesis by cultured smooth muscle cells. Here we have investigated, in rats, the hypothesis that increased exposure to vitamin D during gestation and in the postnatal period alters aortic elastin content and aortic function. Methods: Nine breeding pairs of Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to one of three diets containing 3000 (control group), 6000 (low dose) or 12, 000 (high dose) IU/kg vitamin D during pregnancy and lactation. Male pups were continued on the same diet until 6 weeks of age. Aortic elastin content was assessed by measuring desmosine+isodesmosine content using capillary zone electrophoresis. Transverse aortic sections were used for quantification of elastic lamellae and morphometric analysis. The contractility of aortic rings was assessed in an organ <b>bath</b> <b>preparation.</b> Results: The desmosine+isodesmosine content of the abdominal aorta of 6 -week-old male pups, was 14. 1, 10. 0 and 10. 1 nmol/mg dry weight in the control (n= 20), low- (n= 23) and high-dose (n= 15) groups, respectively (P= 0. 007).

There {{were no significant differences in}} aortic cross-sectional areas or media:adventitia ratios.

Conclusion: In rats, exposure to increased amounts of vitamin D during gestation and early life results in a reduction of aortic elastin content, number of elastic lamellae in the aorta and force generation in aortic rings. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The EP- 61 primary {{containment}} vessel of the 5320 shipping package {{has been used}} for storage and transportation of Pu- 238 plutonium oxide heat source material. For storage, the material in its convenience canister called EP- 60 is placed in the EP- 61 and sealed by two threaded caps with elastomer O-ring seals. When the package is shipped, the outer cap is seal welded to the body. While stored, the EP- 61 s are placed in a cooling water <b>bath.</b> In <b>preparation</b> for welding, several containers are removed from storage and staged to the welding booth. The significant heat generation of the contents, and resulting rapid rise in component temperature necessitates special handling practices. The test described here was performed to determine the temperature rise with time and peak temperature attained for an EP- 61 with 203 watts of internal heat generation, upon its removal from the cooling water bath...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: One of {{the reasons}} behind the {{interest}} in copper titanium alloys was development of new materials to substitute copper beryllium alloys. The reason for selecting that material for studies {{was that in the}} early stages of decomposition of CuTi 4 alloy a spinodal transformation takes place and ordering processes begin. Proper selection of heat treatment and plastic working conditions provides possibilities to produce very wide range of sets of properties by formation of the required alloy microstructure. Therefore the main objective of the study was to capture the changes in precipitation kinetics, especially in the relations between supersaturation and ageing or between supersaturaion, cold deformation and ageing in connection to the changes in microstructure and functional properties (mainly changes in hardness and electrical conductivity). Design/methodology/approach: Melting of the charge material was conducted in medium-frequency induction furnace, in a graphite crucible. The melted material after <b>bath</b> <b>preparation</b> was poured into a cast iron ingot mould (with graphite grease applied on the inside) of dimensions 35 x 120 x 250 mm. The ingots after casting were peeled. The treated ingots were heated in resistance furnace at 900 ºC for 1. 5 hour and rolled down on a reversible two-high mill. Findings: Decomposition of supersaturated solid solution in that alloy is similar to the alloys produced in laboratory scale. The observed differences in microstructure after supersaturation were related to the presence of undissolved Ti particles and increased segregation of titanium distribution in copper matrix including microareas of individual grains. The mentioned factors influence the mechanism and kinetics of precipitation and subsequently the produced wide ranges of functional properties of the alloy. Research limitations/implications: Cold deformation (50 % reduction) of the alloy after supersaturation changes the mechanism and kinetics of precipitation and provides possibilities for production of broader sets of functional properties. It is expected that widening of the cold deformation range should result in more complete characteristics of material properties, suitable for the foreseen applications. Similar effects can be expected after application of cold deformation after ageing. Practical implications: The elaborated research results present some utilitarian qualities since they can be used in development of process conditions for industrial scale production of strips from CuTi 4 alloy of defined properties and operating qualities. Originality/value: The mentioned factors influence the mechanism and kinetics of precipitation and subsequently the produced wide ranges of functional properties of the Cu-Ti alloys...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} quantum <b>bath</b> engineering for <b>preparation</b> of any {{orbital state}} with controllable phase factor of a superconducting flux qubit assisted by a microwave coplanar waveguide resonator. We investigate the polarization {{efficiency of the}} arbitrary direction rotating on the Bloch sphere, and obtain an effective Rabi frequency by using the convergence condition of Markovian master equation. The processes of polarization can be implemented effectively in a dissipative environment created by resonator photon loss when the spectrum of the microwave resonator matches with the specially tailored Rabi and resonant frequencies of the drive. Our calculations indicate that state-preparation fidelities in excess of 99 % and the required time {{on the order of}} magnitude of microsecond are in principle possible for experimentally reasonable sample parameters. Furthermore, our proposal could be applied to other systems with spin-based qubits. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figures, accepted by PR...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Activation {{of neurons}} {{in the bed}} nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) plays a {{critical}} role in stress and anxiety-related behaviors. Previously, we have shown that serotonin (5 -HT) can directly modulate BNST neuronal excitability by an action at postsynaptic receptors. In this study we built upon that work {{to examine the effects of}} 5 -HT on excitatory neurotransmission in an in vitro rat BNST slice <b>preparation.</b> <b>Bath</b> application of 5 -HT reversibly reduced the amplitude of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs). These effects were mimicked by the 5 -HT 1 B/D receptor agonist, sumatriptan, and by the 5 -HT 1 B receptor selective agonist, CP 93129. Conversely, the effects of 5 -HT and sumatriptan could be blocked by the 5 -HT 1 B receptor-selective antagonist, GR 55562. In contrast, the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist 8 -OH DPAT or antagonist WAY 100635 could not mimic or block th...|$|R
40|$|A {{constant}} intraluminal {{pressure system}} {{was used to}} evaluate the effects of Kv 1 channel blockers on the peristaltic activity of guinea-pig ileum. The nortriterpene correolide, a non-selective inhibitor of all Kv 1 sub-types, causes progressive and sustained reduction of the pressure threshold for eliciting peristaltic contractions. Margatoxin (MgTX), alpha-dendrotoxin (α-DTX) and dendrotoxin-K (DTX-K), highly selective peptidyl inhibitors of certain Kv 1 sub-types, cause immediate reduction of the pressure threshold. This effect subsides with time, irrespective of the peptides' concentration in the <b>bath.</b> In <b>preparations</b> pretreated with saturating concentrations of MgTX, correolide further stimulates the peristaltic activity. Iberiotoxin (IbTX), a selective inhibitor of the high-conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ (BK) channels, and charybdotoxin (ChTX), which inhibits Kv 1. 2 and Kv 1. 3 as well as BK channels, fail to stimulate the peristaltic activity. Blockade of muscarinic receptors by atropine reduces, and occasionally suppresses the peristaltic activity of guinea-pig ileum. In atropine-treated preparations, correolide and MgTX retain their abilities to reduce the pressure threshold and are able to restore the peristaltic reflex in the preparations where this reflex was suppressed by atropine. The stimulatory effect of correolide and MgTX in atropine-treated preparations is abolished by subsequent addition of selective antagonists of both NK 1 and NK 2 receptors. In conclusion, blockade of Kv 1, particularly Kv 1. 1 channels, increases the peristaltic activity of guinea-pig ileum by enhancing the release of neurotransmitters at the enteric nervous system. In contrast, stimulation of the myogenic motility by blockade of BK channels does not affect the threshold for the peristaltic reflex...|$|R
50|$|At the Alvarado hacienda Tessa {{is taking}} a <b>bath</b> in <b>preparation</b> for a party at Montoya's and is reminiscing with Marta about the parties she {{attended}} back in Madrid. Marta points out {{she is going to}} find about gold shipments Montoya is making. At the party, eternally-cuckolded Don Hidalgo is calling for his wife Vera who is nowhere to be found. Canoodling with Captain Grisham until she hears her husband's voice. Tessa and Marta are mingling when Tessa spies Antonio across the room talking to Montoya, bringing back a flood of memories of two years earlier when they were sweethearts in Madrid when she and Marta witnessed Antonio dueling and called out to save his life when his beaten opponent tried to kill him from behind. Marta is not pleased that Antonio regards honor above all else, but Tessa defends him and later that day, when he is going off to fight Napoleon, is ready to give up her virginity, but he stops her as a matter of honor. She gave him her Saint Christopher pendant to keep him safe. Now he is here in Santa Helena on business and will be a rich man and wants to meet her again. Montoya and Grisham, watching with surprise that Antonio and Tessa know each other set a plan in motion using a drunken coach driver, trying in vain to impress Marta, boasting of taking gold in the coach tomorrow at dawn. Marta informs Tessa on the journey back home, but she is happy with seeing Antonio, much to Marta's annoyance.|$|R
