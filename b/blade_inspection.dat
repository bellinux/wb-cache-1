40|$|To {{maximize}} aerodynamic efficiency, large-scale {{offshore wind}} turbine <b>blades</b> require <b>inspection</b> during the production stage to ensure strict tolerance requirements are met. During production, the blade is fixed at the root, restricting movement in the Z direction. X, Y, Rx, Ry and Rz remain unconstrained causing blade flex due to gravity. This deforms the blade away from the theoretical CAD blade location, causing measurement results that do not accurately represent the blade profile. Measurement error can be minimized using rigorous B-spline data alignment. Such alignment compensates for blade flex by varying the constrained Degrees of Freedom (DoF), and provides manufacturers with confidence in the design process. This paper used Coherent Laser Radar and Spatial Analyzer to establish the optimal constrained DoF variation, giving the most accurate data alignment solution. Of the constraints investigated, the optimal data transformation solution was found with a double B-spline alignment method, whilst constraining movement in Y, Z and Ry...|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} uses four experimental sickles containing flint and novaculite blades {{to harvest}} wet, growing grass and mature, dry rye {{in an effort}} to determine the differences in the development of sickle polish and other use wear traces caused by moisture content and other plant characteristics. During harvesting, samples of harvested material averaging about two handfuls were collected. These samples were massed, dried, and massed again to determine moisture content of the plants. The sickles were each used for approximately 13 hours. Each blade was then cast using high resolution dental epoxy for microscopic inspection. An edge survey was conducted along each blade starting at 100 x magnification and increasing as needed to 200 x. Microscopic examination of the sickle blades shows varying development of sickle wear stages. The flint blades used to harvest wet grass show higher levels of development of sickle gloss overall, with sickle gloss continuously coating the surface of the stone. The novaculite blades used to harvest wet grass show slightly lower levels of development of sickle gloss, with gloss discontinuously coating the surface of the stone. Both sickles used to harvest dry rye show barely developed sickle gloss, with gloss existing in isolated, discontinuous patches. The blades used to harvest wet grass show increased numbers of highly rounded microplating margins when compared to the rye sickles. Additionally, the difference in the abrasive nature of the plants generated different forms of striations. The tougher, more abrasive rye heavily striated the surface of the blades. The softer, fibrous grass produced finer striations {{on the surface of the}} <b>blades.</b> Microscopic <b>inspection</b> of the <b>blades</b> shows the process of rounding over the edge is likely a tandem process between edge abrasion and microplating, with the abrasion occurring first. While it is clear that moisture content affects the development of sickle gloss, other variables such as plant density, hardness, and abrasiveness were not controlled for and, therefore, potentially play an important role...|$|R

Like many recent registration techniques, our Robust-Closest-Patch algorithm (RCP) iteratively matches model patches to data surfaces based on the current pose and then re-estimates pose based on these matches. RCP has several novel features: 1) on-line registration is driven by low curvature patches computed from the model off-line; 2) an approximate normal distance between a patch and a surface is used, avoiding the need to estimate local surface normal and curvature from noisy data; 3) pose is solved exactly by a linear system in six parameters, using a symmetric formulation of the rotation constraint; 4) robustness is ensured using an M-estimator that estimates both the rigid pose parameters and the error standard deviation.

40|$|Precision {{inspection}} of free-form surface is difficult with current industry practices {{that rely on}} accurate fixtures. Alternatively, the measurements can be aligned to the part model using a geometry-based registration method, such as the iterative closest point (ICP) method, to achieve a fast and automatic inspection process. This paper discusses various techniques that accelerate the registration process and improve {{the efficiency of the}} ICP method. First, the data structures of approximated nearest nodes and topological neighbor facets are combined to speed up the closest point calculation. The closest point calculation is further improved with the cached facets across iteration steps. The registration efficiency can also be enhanced by incorporating signal-to-noise ratio into the transformation of correspondence sets to reduce or remove the noise of outliers. Last, an acceleration method based on linear or quadratic extrapolation is fine-tuned to provide the fast yet robust iteration process. These techniques have been implemented on a four-axis <b>blade</b> <b>inspection</b> machine where no accurate fixture is required.

40|$|Turbine blades are {{the most}} common cause of {{failures}} in gas turbines. Failure modes are typically cracking from foreign object damage (FOD), high cycle stress (HCF), blade rubbing, degradation from erosion and corrosion. Fault detection of blades is important function in reducing blade related failures. This study involved the use of vibration analysis and dynamic testing of blades for failure detection. Current field <b>inspections</b> of <b>blades</b> are based on visual inspections only, and the intent here was to use impact testing of the <b>blades</b> during these <b>inspections</b> to determine cracked blade (from the vibration response). Vibration impact tests were undertaken using decommissioned turbine blades with and without cracks in the laboratory. Four common crack patterns were deliberately induced to the turbine blades to investigate changes in the blades normal mode response. Finite element analysis (FEA) of the blades was also undertaken. FEA results were correlated to experimental results and these results showed that each crack pattern was unique and significant changes were found in higher modes. Dynamic vibration analysis was also undertaken in a laboratory testrig fitted with rotating model straight blades. Vibration measurements were undertaken on a baseline test case and other test conditions where the blades had induced cracks. Steady state and transient vibration responses were obtained from the controlled tests. Vibration measurements were on the machine casing and on a blade (with an accelerometer surfaced mounted onto a rotating blade). Order tracking analysis and continuous wavelet analysis were performed to the measured data. Both techniques showed ability in detecting changes in vibration response on the blades and casing for blades with cracks. Results showed that significant changes were detected during transient analysis as compared to the steady state. Changes were noted in the vibration response corresponding to the machine running speed and blade passing frequencies. Changes in wavelet maps were however qualitative in nature, which suggested that more work need to be undertaken for cracks severity assessment using wavelet maps...|$|R

40|$|A health {{monitoring}} approach is investigated for hydrokinetic turbine blade applications. In-service monitoring is critical {{due to the}} difficult environment for <b>blade</b> <b>inspection</b> {{and the cost of}} inspection downtime. Composite blade designs have advantages that include long life in marine environments and great control over mechanical properties. Experimental strain characteristics are determined for static loads and free-vibration loads. These experiments are designed to simulate the dynamic characteristics of hydrokinetic turbine blades. Carbon/epoxy symmetric composite laminates are manufactured using an autoclave process. Four-layer composite beams, eight-layer composite beams, and two-dimensional eight-layer composite blades are instrumented for strain. Experimental results for strain measurements from electrical resistance gages are validated with theoretical characteristics obtained from in-house finite-element analysis for all sample cases. These preliminary tests on the composite samples show good correlation between experimental and finite-element strain results. A {{health monitoring}} system is proposed in which damage to a composite structure, e. g. delamination and fiber breakage, causes changes in the strain signature behavior. The system is based on embedded strain sensors and embedded motes in which strain information is demodulated for wireless transmission. In-service monitoring is critical due to the difficult environment for <b>blade</b> <b>inspection</b> and the cost of inspection downtime. Composite blade designs provide a medium for embedding sensors into the blades for in-situ health monitoring. The major challenge with in-situ health monitoring is transmission of sensor signals from the remote rotating reference frame of the blade to the system monitoring station. In the presented work, a novel system for relaying in-situ blade health measurements in hydrokinetic systems is described and demonstrated. An ultrasonic communication system is used to transmit sensor data underwater from the rotating frame of the blade to a fixed relay station. Data are then broadcast via radio waves to a remote monitoring station. Results indicate that the assembled system can transmit simulated sensor data with an accuracy of Â± 5 % at a maximum sampling rate of 500 samples/sec. A power investigation of the transmitter within the blade shows that continuous max-sampling operation is only possible for short durations (~days), and is limited due to the capacity of the battery power source. However, intermittent sampling, with long periods between samples, allows for the system to last for very long durations (~years). Finally, because the data transmission system can operate at a high sampling rate for short durations or at a lower sampling rate/higher duty cycle for long durations, it is well-suited for short-term prototype and environmental testing, as well as long-term commercially-deployed hydrokinetic machines...|$|E
40|$|The {{automatic}} radioscopic {{inspection of}} industrial parts usually uses reference based methods. These methods select, as benchmark for comparison, image data from good parts {{to detect the}} anomalies of parts under inspection. However, parts can vary within the specification during the production process, which makes comparison of older reference image sets with current images of parts difficult and increases the probability of false rejections. To counter this variability, the reference image sets have to be updated. This paper proposes an adaptive reference image set selection procedure {{to be used in}} the assisted defect recognition (ADR) system in turbine <b>blade</b> <b>inspection.</b> The procedure first selects an initial reference image set using an approach called ADR Model Optimizer and then uses positive rate in a sliding-time window to determine the need to update the reference image set. Whenever there is a need, the ADR Model Optimizer is retrained with new data consisting of the old reference image sets augmented with false rejected images to generate a new reference image set. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed procedure can adaptively select a reference image set, leading to an inspection process with a high true positive rate and a low false positive rate...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, we have {{conducted}} a feasibility study on UAV application for ultrasonic pulsed non-destructive testing of wind turbine rotor blades. Due to the high initial cost of wind turbines, and their decreasing availability due to increasing size and offshore locations, {{it is imperative to}} properly maintain these structures over their 10 - 30 -year lifetime. Operation and maintenance costs can account for 25 - 30 % of the overall energy generation costs (MartinezLuengo, et al., 2016), where the wind turbine rotor blade can be considered the most critical component, accounting for 15 - 20 % of the manufacturing costs. Thus, an increase in O&M efficiency of wind turbine rotor blades through condition monitoring can yield substantial financial benefits. Currently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are in use for visual and thermography inspection of wind turbines. These techniques for structural condition monitoring does have serious limitations, as the condition of internal components in blades, built from glass fibre laminates, cannot be visually inspected. However, pulsed ultrasonic echo technique have proven highly efficient for wind turbine rotor <b>blade</b> <b>inspection.</b> The ultrasonic transducer requires surface contact with the examined material, and we investigated the potential of UAV implementation for fast, safe and reliable measurements of wind turbine rotor blades. This feasibility study investigates the applicability of ultrasonic testing of glass fibre laminates, specifically glass fibre produced by Lyngen Plast A/S. Firstly, we conducted handheld ultrasonic tests on simulated delamination defects, looking for damage indications on a voltage-time graph. Secondly, we induced damage on a 27 mm thick sample through a 3 -point bending test and measured the echo response from the ultrasonic pulse. The second experiment was repeated using a Storm AntiGravity UAV, producing promising results with preliminary instrumentation. A significant challenge to the feasibility of this study was the operational risks. We carried out a preliminary and qualitative risk assessment of the intended UAV operation by using the SWIFTanalysis and Bow-Tie method. The results were two important risk-mitigating measures. Risk reductive: “Design UAV for impact with wind turbine rotor blades,” and risk preventive: “Develop statistical data on wind conditions at wind turbine site, calculate low-risk dates for flight. ” The implementation of the said measures, quality of our results, experiences from the UAV flight and concept considerations are presented throughout this paper.
