40|$|Thick {{composite}} beams {{are used}} as primary structural members in various engineering applications, for example, composite flex beams in a hinge less rotor system of modern helicopters. One end of the flex beam yoke {{is connected to the}} rotor hub through joints and the other end is connected similarly to the rotor blade. A flex beam yoke has to support rotating loads, vibratory bending loads and torsional loads. It should be strong enough to hold the blade yet flexible enough to allow for the flapping motion. Hence, it is essential to understand the mechanism of stress development, crack initiation and propagation in a bolted thick composite beam, which is subjected to axial and flexural loads. A unidirectional glass/epoxy thick composite beam is considered in this study. A common engineering practice is to use bolted joints to attach two structural members and the bolts are pre-tensed. <b>Buffer</b> <b>pads</b> are attached to the composite beam to avoid localized damage. To simulate the real life situation, a CAD model is generated using ABAQUS 1] consisting of a thick composite beam with eight bolt holes, <b>buffer</b> <b>pads,</b> steel clamping blocks, steel washers and steel bolts. The composite beam is attached to a rigid block using a clamping block, washers and bolts. The finite element mesh is generated using 3 -D continuum elements, C 3 D 8 I. Nonlinear stress analysis is performed for bolt pre-tension and bending loads with material and contact nonlinearity. The numerical results depend on the element type in finite element analysis. Parametric study for element selection between SC 8, C 3 D 8 and C 3 D 20 is carried out. The finite element analysis results are compared with the experimental values. Different failure criteria are considered to study the failure behavior of the thick composite beam: Tsai-Wu, Christensen, and Puck, Hashin and quadratic delamination failure criteria. These failure criteria are coded in ABAQUS through user subroutines. The bolt holes act as stress concentration regions in the beam, where the failure behavior is studied utilizing the above criteria. The effect of different loading, such as bolt pre-tension, bending on the failure of the composite thick beam are investigated...|$|R

30|$|All {{buffered}} packets {{can be sent}} to eNB {{after one}} random access procedure. Note that during the random access, new packets may be generated causing the aggregated packet to become larger that the transport block size (i.e., the aggregated packet cannot be transmitted by a single transmission). In such a case, a UE will signal a (<b>padding)</b> <b>buffer</b> status report (BSR) along with the data packet to allow an eNB to adapt the uplink resource allocation accordingly. With this assumption, there is no backlogged packets in the idle state. Therefore, due to this memory-less characteristic, the waiting time for the first packet remains the same 1 /λ.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a 0. 35 - m CMOS fourth-order bandpass analog–digital sigma–delta () modulator for wide-band base stations receivers. The modulator, {{based on a}} time-in-terleaved four-path architecture, achieves an equivalent sampling frequency of 280 MHz, although the building blocks operate at only 70 MHz. In measurements, the prototype chip achieves a dy-namic range of 72 dB (12 bits of resolution) with a signal band-width of 4. 375 MHz centered around an intermediate frequency of 70 MHz. The measured spurious-free dynamic range is 69 dB. The modulator dissipates 480 mW from a 3. 3 -V supply, including voltage reference <b>buffers</b> and output <b>pads</b> with high-driving capa-bilities, and occupies 20 mm 2 of silicon area.

50|$|The orle {{originated}} as a functional, padded roll {{of fabric}} worn around the bascinet helmet in the 14th century. In this period the bascinet was often worn under a great helm, and the orle {{served as a}} <b>padded</b> <b>buffer</b> between the two helmets. The force of any blow received on the great helm would tend to be absorbed by the orle, rather than being directly transmitted to the bascinet and the head within it. Additionally, the orle helped to keep the great helm steady on the head. Later, certainly before 1400, the bascinet was increasingly worn on its own. In {{the first half of}} the 15th century the orle developed into a purely decorative addition to the helmet. It also helped to conceal the junction of a heraldic crest with the helmet, if a crest were to be worn.|$|R

40|$|Profiles of polyribosomes were {{obtained}} from etiolated stem segments of Pisum sativum L. var. Alaska isolated in various buffers. Tissue homogenized in a medium containing 0. 2 m tris-HCl, pH 8. 5, 0. 2 m sucrose, 30 mm MgCl 2, and 60 mm KCl yielded polyribosomes exhibiting far less degradation than tissue homogenized in conventional media containing tris-HCl at lower ionic strength and pH. A further decrease in degradation was found when polyribosomes were sedimented through a sucrose <b>pad</b> <b>buffered</b> at pH 8. 5 prior to centrifugation. Increased separation was obtained using heavy (125 - 500 mg/ml), linear sucrose gradients. Using these techniques, messenger RNA species bearing up to 12 ribosomes (dodecamers) were resolved, with messenger RNA chains bearing 9 ribosomes (nonamers) being the most abundant (having the highest absorption peak). The data presented suggest that buffer of high ionic strength and high pH was more effective in preventing degradation of polyribosomes than was diethyl pyrocarbonate and, furthermore, that ratios involving large polyribosomes (hexamers and larger) were more accurate indices of degradation than were ratios involving total polyribosomes...|$|R
40|$|Coding) decoder {{based on}} an {{optimized}} platform-based design methodology. With this methodology, we jointly optimize the software and hardware design of the decoder. Overall decoding throughput is increased by synchronizing the software and the dedicated co-processors. The synchronization is achieved at macroblock-level pipelining. In addition, we optimize the decoder software by enhancing the frame <b>buffer</b> management, boundary <b>padding,</b> and content aware inverse transform. To speed up motion compensation and inverse transform, which are the most computationally intensive modules, two dedicated acceleration modules are realized. For comparison, the proposed prototype decoder and MPEG- 4 AVC reference decoder are evaluated on an ARM platform, {{which is one of}} most popular portable devices. Our experiments show that the throughput of the MPEG- 4 reference decoder can be improved by 6 to 7 times. On an ARM 966 board, the optimized software without hardware acceleration can achieve a decoding rate up to 5 frames per second (fps) for QCIF video sequences. With the dedicated accelerators, the overall throughput is increased by about 30 % to reach 6. 6 fps on the average and is up to 10. 3 fps for slow motion video sequences. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{baseline}} MPEG- 4 Advanced Video Coding (AVC) decoder {{based on the}} methodology of joint optimization of software and hardware. The software is first optimized with algorithm improvements for frame <b>buffer</b> management, boundary <b>padding,</b> content-aware inverse transform and context-based entropy decoding. The overall decoding throughput is further enhanced by pipelining the software and the dedicated hardware at macroblock level. The decoder is partitioned into the software and hardware modules according to the target frame rate and complexity profiles. The hardware acceleration modules include motion compensation, inverse transform and loop filtering. By comparing the optimized decoder with the committee reference decoder of Joint Video Team (JVT), the experimental results show improvement on the decoding throughput by 7 to 8 times. On an ARM 966 board, the optimized software without hardware acceleration can achieve a decoding rate up to 5. 9 frames per second (fps) for QCIF video source. The overall throughput is improved by another 27 % to 7. 4 fps on the average and up to 11. 5 fps for slow motion video sequences. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the ideal performance of the proposed decoder.

40|$|Every airline {{passenger}} {{faces the}} risk of arriving late because flight times are subjected to many sources of variability. These can be weather conditions and airspace congestion, imbalances between airport demand and capacity, fleet and crew availability, technical failures and delays in maintenance, and other airline operations such as boarding and fueling. The main objective of this thesis is to explore the most common sources of variability in flight operations and study how U. S. carriers add <b>buffer</b> time (or <b>pad)</b> to scheduled block time to account for them. Using flight data from FAA Aviation System Performance Metrics, we analyze the scheduled and actual flight times on 2359 directional non-stop domestic routes during 2009. The time of each flight is decomposed to delay at gate, taxi-out time, airborne time and taxi-in time. Then, the buffer time of each flight is computed, using as nominal airborne time the lO percentile of the actual airborne time distribution. Our study consists of two parts. First, an aggregate statistical analysis is performed, concentrating on trends and correlations among factors such as buffer, flight time components, route distance, seasonality effects, delays caused by Ground Delay Programs, time of day and day of week, a flight's relative position to other flights operated {{on the same day}} by the same aircraft, total number of flights operated by the same aircraft during a day, the role of airport and carriers' network structure. Finally, we perform an econometric analysis through linear regression models to estimate how some of the above factors affect carriers' padding and their on-time performance. The results indicate distance and time of day {{to be the most important}} factors that affect schedule <b>padding.</b> While absolute <b>buffer</b> increases with distance, when buffer is measured as a fraction of nominal block time it decreases exponentially. Furthermore, buffer and on-time performance fluctuate strongly over the course of the day, with flights scheduled to arrive during the evening peak having the worst on-time performance, despite the fact that these flights are padded the most. The data reveal that among the studied carriers Southwest pads its schedule more extensively, achieving a very high on-time performance, whereas other low cost carriers pad their flights substantially less, and have a lower on-time performance. Our findings also show that flights destined to the carrier's hub have more buffer than flights destined to spoke airports. Last, competition has a positive effect on schedule buffer and on-time performance. by Gerasimos Skaltsas. Thesis (S.
