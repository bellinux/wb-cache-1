5000|$|In mathematics, {{the common}} {{logarithm}} is the logarithm with base 10. It {{is also known}} as the decadic logarithm and also as the decimal logarithm, named after its base, or <b>Briggsian</b> <b>logarithm,</b> after Henry Briggs, an English mathematician who pioneered its use, as well as [...] "standard logarithm". Historically, it was known as logarithmus decimalis or logarithmus decadis. It is indicated by log10(x), or sometimes Log(x) with a capital L (however, this notation is ambiguous since it can also mean the complex natural logarithmic multi-valued function). On calculators it is usually [...] "log", but mathematicians usually mean natural logarithm (logarithm with base e â‰ˆ 2.71828) rather than common logarithm when they write [...] "log". To mitigate this ambiguity the ISO 80000 specification recommends that log10(x) should be written lg (x) and loge(x) should be ln (x).|$|E

2500|$|Lilly's autobiography, {{published}} {{towards the}} end of his life in 1681, at the request of his patron Elias Ashmole, gives candid accounts of the political events of his era, and biographical details of contemporaries that are unavailable elsewhere. It was described, in the late 18th century, as [...] "one of the most entertaining narratives in our language", in particular for the historical portrayal it leaves of men like John Dee, Simon Forman, John Booker, Edward Kelley, including a whimsical first meeting of John Napier and Henry Briggs, [...] respective co-inventors of the <b>logarithm</b> and <b>Briggsian</b> <b>logarithms,</b> and for its curious tales about the effects of crystals and the appearance of Queen Mab. In it, Lilly describes the friendly support of Oliver Cromwell during a period in which he faced prosecution for issuing political astrological predictions. He also writes about the 1666 Great Fire of London, and how he was brought before the committee investigating the cause of the fire, being suspected of involvement because of his publication of images, 15 years earlier, which depicted a city in flames surrounded by coffins.|$|R
