40|$|ABSTRACT—Psychologists, {{self-help}} gurus, {{and parents}} all {{work to make}} their clients, friends, and children happier. Recent research indicates that happiness is functional and generally leads to success. However, most people are al-ready above neutral in happiness, which raises the ques-tion of whether higher levels of happiness facilitate more effective functioning than do lower levels. Our analyses of large survey data and longitudinal data show that people who experience {{the highest levels of}} happiness are the most successful in terms of close relationships and volunteer work, but that those who experience slightly lower levels of happiness are the most successful in terms of income, education, and political participation. Once people are moderately happy, the most effective level of happiness appears to depend on the specific outcomes used to define success, as well as the resources that are available. Despite the fact that most people are already satisfied with their lives (Diener & Diener, 1996), many people aspire to be even happier. There are hundreds of self-help books, motivational speakers, and life coaches whose primary goal is to improve sub-jective well-being. In light of these attempts to boost well-being, it is necessary to questionwhether <b>being</b> <b>happier</b> is <b>always</b> better. Is it sensible for a society to encourage already happy people to aspire to even higher levels of well-being? 1 The present article focuses on the differences between moderately happy and very happy people to address questions about the optimal level of happiness. The issues of optimal happiness are not merely academic. In recent years, psychologists and economists have increasingly called for large-scale projects that track national levels of well-being over time. The ultimate goal of these proposed national indexes of well-being is to enable decision-makers to use in-formation about a population’s well-being to guide public polic...|$|R
