We also propose a theoretical model of the damping mechanism, in which the increase of the spread in synchrotron frequencies inside the bunches produced by <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> is responsible for damping the centroid dipolar coherent motion caused by an external excitation, which could be a Higher Order Mode (HOM) of the RF cavities driving the coupled bunch mo-tion. We measured the coherent synchrotron oscillation damping of a single bunch under two circumstances, with and without <b>phase</b> <b>modulation,</b> and determined the amount of extra damping due to the modulation.

Continuous <b>Phase</b> <b>Modulation</b> (CPM) Broad class of frequency modulation techniques where the carrier phase varies in continuous manner is called continuous <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> (CPM).

40|$|Insulin is {{secreted}} in a pulsatile manner {{from multiple}} micro-organs called the islets of Langerhans. The amplitude and phase (shape) of insulin secretion are modulated by numerous factors including glucose. The role of <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> in glucose homeostasis {{is not well}} understood compared to the obvious contribution of amplitude modulation. In the present study, we measured Ca 2 + oscillations in islets {{as a proxy for}} insulin pulses, and we observed their frequency and shape changes under constant/alternating glucose stimuli. Here we asked how the <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> of insulin pulses contributes to glucose regulation. To directly answer this question, we developed a phenomenological oscillator model that drastically simplifies insulin secretion, but precisely incorporates the observed <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> of insulin pulses in response to glucose stimuli. Then, we mathematically modeled how insulin pulses regulate the glucose concentration in the body. The model of insulin oscillation and glucose regulation describes the glucose-insulin feedback loop. The data-based model demonstrates that the existence of <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> narrows the range within which the glucose concentration is maintained through the suppression/enhancement of insulin secretion in conjunction with the amplitude modulation of this secretion. The <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> is the response of islets to glucose perturbations. When multiple islets are exposed to the same glucose stimuli, they can be entrained to generate synchronous insulin pulses. Thus, we conclude that the <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> of insulin pulses is essential for glucose regulation and inter-islet synchronization...|$|R
