50|$|The Complex will be {{completely}} {{implemented by the}} private sector and aims to prevent further sales of crude in favor of selling the end products. The total capacity of 480,000 BPSD will produce a daily total <b>of</b> (8×1,912) <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> LPG, (8×15,071) <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> light naphtha, (8×20,998) <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> heavy naphtha, (8×10,236) <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> kerosene (jet A1), and (8×10,835) <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> gas oil with Euro-V specifications.|$|R

As of 2002, {{the country has}} no known reserves of oil, natural gas or coal.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the legal}} {{right-of-way}} was cleared by January 1974, cold weather, {{the need to}} hire workers, and construction of the Dalton Highway meant work on the pipeline itself did not begin until March. Between 1974 and July 28, 1977, when the first <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> oil reached Valdez, {{tens of thousands of}} people worked on the pipeline. Thousands of workers came to Alaska, attracted by the prospect of high-paying jobs at a time when most of the rest of the United States was undergoing a recession.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} November 1996, with the moving of {{underground}} pipes and wires around the station areas. In August 1997, work {{started at the}} depot, and in September, COMET started the first mainline work. In October and November, the two tunnel boring machines (TBM), christened Liva and Bette, were delivered. They started boring each <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> the tunnel from Islands Brygge in February 1998. The same month, the Public Transport Authority gave the necessary permits to operate a driverless metro. The section between Fasanvej and Frederiksberg is a former S-train line, and was last operated as such on 20 June 1998.|$|E

50|$|In the 25 {{years to}} 2009, the McKee field {{produced}} 47 million <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> crude oil and 150 PJ of natural gas. Current daily production is 420 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> crude oil, 800 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> condensate and 20 TJ of natural gas.|$|R
50|$|Gasoline, jet {{and diesel}} fuel {{are the primary}} products, which are {{supplied}} to end users predominantly in Washington and Oregon. Its secondary processing facilities include a fluid catalytic cracker, an alkylation unit, hydrotreating units and a naphtha reformer. Given that configuration the plant likely follows a 10-5-3-2 crack spread, meaning that for 10 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> crude feedstock the refinery produces 5 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> gasoline, 3 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> distillate and 2 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> fuel oil.|$|R
5|$|In 1942, {{trying to}} solve the problem of lack of a {{suitable}} mobile 152mm howitzer, the design bureau headed by F. F. Petrov started to work privately on a new howitzer, based on the carriage of the M-30 and the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> the M-10 (which was fitted with a muzzle brake in order to reduce the recoil and thus prevent damage to the lighter carriage). The approach allowed production to begin on the new howitzer almost immediately from the stockpile of parts for both earlier guns. Given the war situation and shortages of artillery, this solution was both elegant and expedient.|$|E
5|$|The D-1 {{howitzer}} {{was essentially}} {{a combination of the}} <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> the 152-mm howitzer model 1938 (M-10) on the carriage of the 122-mm howitzer M1938 (M-30). Since the new carriage was lighter than that of the M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 to soften the shock of recoil. The breech block was of interrupted screw type, the recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The separately loaded ammunition included a variety of shells and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E
5|$|These {{guns are}} {{air-cooled}} {{and use a}} gas blow-back recoil system. Unlike other automatic guns employed during World War II, the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> the 20mm Oerlikon gun does not recoil; the breechblock is never locked against the breech and is actually moving forward when the gun fires. This weapon lacks a counter-recoil brake, as {{the force of the}} counter-recoil is checked by recoil from the firing of the next round of ammunition.|$|E

5000|$|For simplicity, most {{refiners}} {{wishing to}} hedge their price exposures {{have used a}} crack ratio usually expressed as X:Y:Z where X represents a number <b>of</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> crude oil, Y represents a number <b>of</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> gasoline and Z represents a number <b>of</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> distillate fuel oil, subject to the constraint that X=Y+Z. This crack ratio is used for hedging purposes by buying X <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> crude oil and selling Y <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> gasoline and Z <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> distillate in the futures market. The crack spread X:Y:Z reflects the spread obtained by trading oil, gasoline and distillate according to this ratio. Widely used crack spreads have included 3:2:1, 5:3:2 and 2:1:1. As the 3:2:1 crack spread {{is the most popular}} of these, widely quoted crack spread benchmarks are the [...] "Gulf Coast 3:2:1" [...] and the [...] "Chicago 3:2:1".|$|R
50|$|The Carabobo-1 project {{commenced}} {{production in}} December 2012, with its first well CGO-0005 producing 30,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> oil per day by 2013. It {{is expected to}} reach a peak production <b>of</b> 400,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> oil per day by 2018. The Carabobo-2 project is still in its early stage of development, yet to produce. The Carabobo-3 project has begun engineering for development, and expected to start producing 50,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> oil per day, with a peak production <b>of</b> 400,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> oil per day by 2020. Upgraders capable <b>of</b> processing 200,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> oil per day into a lighter synthetic oil are expected to be built by 2017 to convert the tar-like crude into an usable and exportable commodity.|$|R

5|$|This is {{a variant}} of the special purpose weapon adopted by USSOCOM. The program, which led to both the Mk 46 and Mk 48, was headed by the US Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWAR). Like the SPW, the barrel {{changing}} handle, magazine insertion well, and vehicle mounting lugs have been removed to save weight. However, the Mk 46 retains the standard M249 plastic buttstock instead of the collapsible buttstock used on the SPW. The Picatinny rail forearm differs slightly from the SPW. The Mk 46 has the option of using the lighter SPW barrel or a thicker, fluted <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> the same length.|$|E
5|$|Later, Walt and Jesse {{dispose of}} Victor's body, the gun that killed Gale, {{and the box}} cutter in a <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> {{hydrofluoric}} acid. During breakfast later, Walt insists to Jesse that Gale's death was necessary, but expresses concern that Gus will kill them at his next opportunity. Jesse doubts this, believing {{it will be too}} much trouble for Gus to find another drug manufacturer, and that both they and Gus understand the situation: neither can kill the other, so Gus might as well make them wish they were dead. The episode ends with police investigating Gale's apartment with the camera focusing on his lab notes which have yet to be discovered.|$|E

50|$|The Zebra was a three-masted ship, {{built in}} 1818, and {{displacing}} 350 tonnes. On 12 August 1838, the Zebra, captained by Dirk Meinerts Hahn, departed from Altona, Hamburg for its voyage to Port Misery, South Australia. The ship arrived at its destination on 28 December 1838. On board was {{a crew of}} 16 and 188 passengers with their belongings. In addition, the ship carried 100 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> pork, 100 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> flour, 65 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> fresh water, 17 hogsheads of beer and vinegar, 14 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> herrings, two boxes of boots and 40,924 bricks.|$|R

5|$|The Nanjakana {{compound}} is {{the most}} highly elevated of the three compounds in the rova at Ambohimanga. Located to the northeast of Mahandrinoro, this compound {{is believed to have}} been first constructed by Andrianjafy in the late eighteenth century. To the north of the compound is a stone esplanade that offers a clear view of the surrounding areas where Andrianampoinimerina reportedly came to reflect on his military strategy for bringing Imerina under his control. During the 1861 funeral of Queen Ranavalona I held in the Nanjakana compound, a spark accidentally ignited a nearby <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> gunpowder destined for use in the ceremony, causing an explosion and fire that killed a number of bystanders and destroyed three of the compound's historic royal residences.|$|E
5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} taxes levied on oil {{production}} in Alaska has changed several times since 1977, {{but the overall}} form remains mostly the same. Alaska receives royalties from oil production on state land. The state also has a property tax on oil production structures and transportation (pipeline) property—the only state property tax in Alaska. There is a special corporate income tax on petroleum companies, and the state taxes the amount of petroleum produced. This production tax is levied {{on the cost of}} oil at Pump Station 1. To calculate this tax, the state takes the market value of the oil, subtracts transportation costs (tanker and pipeline tariffs), subtracts production costs, then multiplies the resulting amount per <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> oil produced each month. The state then takes a percentage of the dollar figure produced.|$|E

5|$|When Chandler was 14, {{he began}} {{stealing}} cars and was arrested 20times as a juvenile. As an adult, {{he was charged}} with a variety of crimes, including possession of counterfeit money, loitering and prowling, burglary, kidnapping, and armed robbery. He was also accused of masturbating while peering inside a woman's window. In one incident, Chandler and an accomplice broke into a Florida couple's home, held them at gunpoint, and robbed them. Chandler told his accomplice to tie up the man with speaker wire and took the woman into the bedroom, where he made her strip to her underwear, tied her up, and rubbed the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> his revolver across her stomach.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of some miners, John and Kanyenke bring down large rock bridges to stop the Russians' large cannons from getting through. John then sends Kanyenke and the {{remainder}} of his mercenaries back east as he plants explosives to cause an avalanche and bury the Russians in the mountains. In the end, as John is setting up the dynamite, Warwick and several Boneguard approach him. Warwick attempts to kill John but John uses a <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> gunpowder as a shield (knowing that Warwick won't risk detonating it by shooting at him), jumps to the trigger, and pushes it, detonating the mountainside; killing himself, the soldiers, and Warwick; and causing an avalanche. The avalanche buries the Russians and sets the Circle of Ossus back so far that they cause no problems for many years.|$|E
5|$|Modeste and Impérieuse were {{high-quality}} modern {{ships and}} were both immediately recommissioned into the Royal Navy, Modeste {{with the same}} name and Impérieuse as HMS Unite as there was already a ship with a similar name in service. The repercussions of this operation were severe however. Gell, acting on instructions from Hood, had violated Genoese neutrality in a deliberate attempt to intimidate the pro-Republican faction in the city, but their actions were readily seized upon by French propagandists such as Nicolas Ozanne, who portrayed the raid as a massacre of unarmed sailors in print form. The Genoese government broke off diplomatic relations with Britain, permitting only French ships to enter the harbour. The British instituted a blockade, {{and as a result}} the 5,000 Austrian reinforcements destined for Toulon were unable to embark. Drake and all British inhabitants of Genoa were expelled, and Gell initiated a blockade of the city, seizing neutral merchant shipping destined for the port. Three ships were stationed at Leghorn to watch the more quiescent Tuscan government, including the Royalist Scipion. On 26 November, Scipion, which was carrying 150 prisoners taken in the raid on Genoa, caught fire, possibly the result of arson, and was destroyed, although other accounts suggest that a <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> brandy was ignited accidentally by a candle. The blaze killed 390 of the Royalist crew, many of whom were classed as unfit for duty.|$|E
