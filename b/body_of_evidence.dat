5|$|In 1990, Madonna starred as Breathless Mahoney in Dick Tracy, {{directed}} by Warren Beatty {{and based on}} Chester Gould's comic strip. She received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress. Beatty later appeared in her 1991 documentary, , which showed {{behind the scenes of}} her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour. It was the highest-grossing documentary of all time at that point. She also received positive reviews for her role in A League of Their Own (1992), which was centered on a women's baseball team during World War II. In 1993, Madonna starred in the erotic thriller <b>Body</b> <b>of</b> <b>Evidence,</b> which performed poorly at the box office. Her subsequent films saw Madonna take on smaller roles, including a singing telegram girl in Blue in the Face (1995), a witch in Four Rooms (1995), and a phone sex company owner in Spike Lee's Girl 6 (1996). Madonna starred as Eva Perón in the 1996 film adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Evita. Her performance was acclaimed by critics and won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.|$|E
5|$|Named for British anesthetist Brian Arthur Sellick (1918–1996) {{who first}} {{described}} the procedure in 1961, {{the goal of}} cricoid pressure is to minimize the possibility of regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. Cricoid pressure has been widely used during RSI for nearly fifty years, {{despite a lack of}} compelling evidence to support this practice. The initial article by Sellick was based on a small sample size at a time when high tidal volumes, head-down positioning and barbiturate anesthesia were the rule. Beginning around 2000, a significant <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> has accumulated which questions the effectiveness of cricoid pressure. The application of cricoid pressure may in fact displace the esophagus laterally instead of compressing it as described by Sellick. Cricoid pressure may also compress the glottis, which can obstruct the view of the laryngoscopist and actually cause a delay in securing the airway.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In pattern {{recognition}} systems, data fusion {{is an important}} issue and evidence theory is one such method that has been successful. Many researchers have proposed different rules for evidence theory, and recently, a variety of averaging rules emerged that are better than others. In these methods, the key issue becomes how to give the weights to the multiple contributing factors, in order to calculate the average. To get better weights for the multiple <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> we propose the use of structural information <b>of</b> the <b>evidence.</b> The <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> lie on a certain informational structure which can be described by a probability distribution and the probability <b>of</b> each <b>evidence</b> can serve as a weight for the evidence. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms other previous methods...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDempster's rule plays {{a central}} role in the theory of belief functions. However, it assumes the {{combined}} <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> to be distinct, an assumption which is not always verified in practice. In this paper, a new operator, the cautious rule of combination, is introduced. This operator is commutative, associative and idempotent. This latter property makes it suitable to combine belief functions induced by reliable, but possibly overlapping <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> A dual operator, the bold disjunctive rule, is also introduced. This operator is also commutative, associative and idempotent, and can be used to combine belief functions issues from possibly overlapping and unreliable sources. Finally, the cautious and bold rules are shown to be particular members of infinite families of conjunctive and disjunctive combination rules based on triangular norms and conorms...|$|R

40|$|Dempster-Shafer (D-S) {{evidence}} {{theory has been}} widely used in various fields. However, how to measure the degree of conflict (similarity) between the <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> is an open issue. In this paper, in order to solve this problem, firstly we propose a modified cosine similarity to measure the similarity between vectors. Then a new similarity measure of basic probability assignment (BPAs) is proposed based on the modified cosine similarity. The new similarity measure can achieve the reasonable measure of the similarity of BPAs and then efficiently measure the degree <b>of</b> conflict among <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> Numerical examples are used to illustrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method.
