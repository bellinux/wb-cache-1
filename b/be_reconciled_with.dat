5|$|Responding to Baron d'Holbach's Système de la Nature (1770) and David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779) {{as well as}} {{the works}} of the French philosophers, Priestley {{maintained}} that materialism and determinism could <b>be</b> <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> a belief in God. He criticised those whose faith was shaped by books and fashion, drawing an analogy between the scepticism of educated men and the credulity of the masses.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people {{came as a surprise}} even to those who knew him well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had {{come to grips with the}} physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an environment where people could freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort. He reasoned that this could best <b>be</b> <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> security by creating a central laboratory in an isolated location.|$|E
5|$|Some {{predictions}} {{of general relativity}} differ significantly from those of classical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Examples of such differences include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, and the gravitational time delay. The {{predictions of}} general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity {{is not the only}} relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how general relativity can <b>be</b> <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E

5|$|The second {{theory is}} simply that the battle {{occurred}} because the Persians finally moved to attack the Athenians. Although this theory has the Persians moving to the strategic offensive, this can <b>be</b> <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> the traditional account of the Athenians attacking the Persians by assuming that, seeing the Persians advancing, the Athenians took the tactical offensive, and attacked them. Obviously, it cannot be firmly established which theory (if either) is correct. However, both theories imply {{that there was some}} kind of Persian activity which occurred on or about the fifth day which ultimately triggered the battle. It is also possible that both theories are correct: when the Persians sent the cavalry by ship to attack Athens, they simultaneously sent their infantry to attack at Marathon, triggering the Greek counterattack.|$|E
5|$|Uruguay had a {{very low}} {{population}} density and a weak government. Ordinary citizens were compelled by circumstances to seek the protection of local caudillos—landlords who were either Colorados or Blancos and who used their workers, mostly gaucho horsemen, as private armies. The civil wars between the two factions were brutal. Harsh tactics produced ever-increasing alienation between the groups, and included seizure of land, confiscation of livestock and executions. The antagonism caused by atrocities, along with family loyalties and political ties, made reconciliation unthinkable. European immigrants, who came in great numbers during {{the latter half of}} the nineteenth century, were drawn into one party or the other; both parties had liberal and conservative wings, so the social and political views of newcomers could <b>be</b> <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> either. The feuding blocs impeded development of a broadly supported central national administration.|$|E
5|$|By 1264, {{the reign}} of Henry III was deeply troubled by {{disputes}} between the king and his nobility. The conflict was caused by several factors: the influence of foreigners at court, a wasteful war over the crown of Sicily, and a personal dispute between King Henry and Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester. In 1258, Henry was forced to accept the so-called Provisions of Oxford, whereby he effectively surrendered control of royal government to a council of magnates. In 1259 the baronial program of reform was further elaborated upon in the Provisions of Westminster. The provisions remained in effect for three years; {{it was not until}} 1261 that Henry was able to move against the opposition. Receiving the papal annulment of the provisions his emissaries had campaigned for, he re-assumed control of government. Over the next two years, however, discontent re-emerged over Henry's style of government. He failed to <b>be</b> <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> Montfort, and he also alienated Gloucester's son and heir Gilbert. In April 1263 Montfort returned to England after a long stay in France, and reignited the reform movement. On 16 July Henry was surrounded by rebel forces in the Tower of London, and once more forced to accept the conditions of the provisions. Prince Edwardthe later King Edward I – now took control of the situation. In October Edward took Windsor Castle, and the baronial alliance started to break up.|$|E

25|$|The United Church {{believes}} that the Bible {{is central to the}} Christian faith and was written by people who were inspired by God.

The United Church of Canada uses the historical-critical method of interpreting the bible.|$|E

25|$|In Pioneer, the United States Supreme Court laid to {{rest the}} {{question}} of whether sexually reproduced plants were statutory subject matter under section 101. The Court made clear that if inventors of new varieties of plants are able to meet the stringent patentability standards of section 101 and section 112, they will be entitled to utility patent protection. Additionally, the Court clarified that section 101 can also <b>be</b> <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> the PPA and the PVPA. In fact, the three statutes may provide overlapping protection and are not mutually exclusive. Thus, inventors of new plant varieties are free to apply for protection under each regime and may benefit from the protection provided by each regime.|$|E
25|$|Traditional stories {{handed down}} by the ancient Romans {{themselves}} explain the earliest history of their city in terms of legend and myth. The most familiar of these myths, {{and perhaps the most}} famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf. They decided to build a city, but after an argument, Romulus killed his brother and the city took his name. According to the Roman annalists, this happened on 21 April 753 BC. This legend had to <b>be</b> <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> a dual tradition, set earlier in time, that had the Trojan refugee Aeneas escape to Italy and found the line of Romans through his son Iulus, the namesake of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Supporters {{believe that}} this plan will be an {{important}} part of what Bush set in place while in office. However, the policy has been criticized on two fronts. Firstly, critics have opined that the United States should deal with solving domestic issues before concentrating on space exploration. Secondly, of the funding {{over the next five years}} that Bush has proposed, only US$1 billion will be in new appropriations while the remaining US$11 billion will be reallocated from NASA's other programs, and therefore inadequate to fully realize this vision. Most of the spending for the new program, and most of the budget cuts for existing programs, are scheduled after the last year of the Bush presidency. It is unclear how the space vision will <b>be</b> <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> budgetary concerns in the longer term.|$|E
