5|$|Immediately {{following}} the First World War, the British Army remained {{responsible for the}} exhumation of remains. The Western Front was divided into sectors and combed for bodies by 12-man exhumation units. Between the Armistice and September 1921, the exhumation units reburied 204,695 bodies. After 1921, no further comprehensive search for bodies was undertaken, and in February 1921 responsibility for the cemeteries {{was transferred to the}} Commission. Nevertheless, despite the rigour of the searches, bodies continued to be discovered in large numbers. In the three years {{following the}} conclusion of the general search 38,000bodies were discovered. In the mid 1920s, 20 to 30bodies were <b>being</b> <b>discovered</b> weekly.|$|E

In his book Toward a Psychology of Being, he advocated a new psychology, “transpersonal, transhuman, centered in the cosmos rather than in human needs and interest, going beyond humanness, identity, self-actualization, and the like ” (1968, p. iv).

5|$|In Europe the Renaissance of the 14th17th centuries heralded a {{scientific}} revival during which botany gradually emerged from natural history {{as an independent}} science, distinct from medicine and agriculture. Herbals were replaced by floras: books that described the native plants of local regions. The invention of the microscope stimulated the study of plant anatomy, and the first carefully designed experiments in plant physiology were performed. With the expansion of trade and exploration beyond Europe, the many new plants <b>being</b> <b>discovered</b> were subjected to an increasingly rigorous process of naming, description, and classification.|$|E
5|$|Ninety-seven British {{prisoners were}} killed and the Germans forced French civilians to bury the bodies in a shallow mass grave the next day.

5|$|The LRDG now began {{a series}} of patrols behind the Axis lines. Near the end of July 'T' Patrol left for the desert to the south of the Gulf of Sirte.

5|$|The {{meetings}} of the Puerto Rican Independence movement which met in St. Thomas were discovered by the Spanish authorities {{and the members of}} the movement were either imprisoned or exiled. In a letter dated October 1, 1824, which Venezuelan rebel leader José María Rojas sent to María de las Mercedes Barbudo, Rojas stated that the Venezuelan rebels had lost their principal contact with the Puerto Rican Independence movement in the Danish island of Saint Thomas and therefore the secret communication which existed between the Venezuelan rebels and the leaders of the Puerto Rican independence movements was in danger of <b>being</b> <b>discovered.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Robinson Crusoe of the novel, who craved human contact, {{most of the}} Warsaw Crusoes {{tried to}} avoid it at all cost. This contradiction was noted by both the Robinsons and those who wrote about them after the war. <b>Being</b> <b>discovered</b> by the Germans in almost all cases meant {{immediate}} death. There were, however, some exceptions, the best known being that of Szpilman's encounter with Wilm Hosenfeld, a captain of the Wehrmacht who helped to hide and feed him. In a few instances those captured were first forced to help the Germans with the looting of the city's ruins, before being either executed or sent to the Pruszków camp.|$|E

2500|$|Devotional idolatry {{has been}} a {{prevalent}} ancient practice in various Jaina sects, wherein learned Tirthankara (Jina) and human gurus have been venerated with offerings, songs and Āratī prayers.

Thus, idolatry {{has been a}} part of the major sects of Jainism such as Digambara and Shvetambara. The earliest archaeological evidence of the idols and images in Jainism is from Mathura, and has been dated to be from the first half of the 1st millennium CE.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} subgenera have been {{proposed}} over the years. For instance in the 1870s and 1880s John Gilbert Baker considerably reorganised Hippeastrum. In 1878 he described nine sections of the genus, but by 1888 he included seven subgenera, namely (number of species in parentheses) Habranthus (10), Phycella (3), Rhodophiala (5), Macropododastrum (1), Omphalissa (6), Aschamia (10) and Lais (3), {{some of which have}} since been treated as separate genera (Habranthus, Rhodophiala). Baker both reduced the original number of species of Herbert, but also enlarged the genus by adding in other genera such as Habranthus, Phycella, Rhodophiala and Rhodolirion (also called Rhodolirium, and subsequently moved to Rhodophilia), which he included as separate sections of Hippeastrum. In addition, he included many new species <b>being</b> <b>discovered</b> in South America, particularly Chile. His 1878 classification included 47 species, reduced to 38 by 1888.|$|E
5|$|Cope and Marsh were {{financially and}} {{socially}} ruined by {{their attempts to}} outcompete and disgrace each other, but they made important contributions to science and the field of paleontology, and provided substantial material for further work—both scientists left behind many unopened boxes of fossils after their deaths. The efforts {{of the two men}} led to more than 136 new species of dinosaurs <b>being</b> <b>discovered</b> and described. The products of the Bone Wars resulted in an increase in knowledge of prehistoric life, and sparked the public's interest in dinosaurs, leading to continued fossil excavation in North America in the decades to follow. Many historical books and fictional adaptations have been published about this period of intense fossil-hunting activity.|$|E

Keenor died in a residential nursing home on 19 October 1972 and his ashes were buried in Thornhill crematorium in Cardiff.

5|$|Not every {{scene was}} {{performed}} live; {{because of the}} increased budget — £7,552 was spent on the serial, nearly double the amount spent on The Quatermass Experiment — Cartier was able to include {{a larger proportion of}} pre-filmed inserts on 35mm film, which were included during the live transmissions of each episode. Most of the pre-filmed material was shot on location at the Shell Haven oil refinery in Stanford-le-Hope, doubling for the factory where the alien creature is being grown on Earth. Filming also took place in rural Essex for material showing the meteorites <b>being</b> <b>discovered</b> in fields, and in the boiler rooms of the under-construction BBC Television Centre in London for scenes set inside the factory. The location film sequences were the most ambitious that had then been attempted in British television drama, which was usually predominantly studio-bound.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before midnight}} on 11 October, a U.S force of four cruisers and five destroyers—under {{the command of}} Rear Admiral Norman Scott—intercepted Gotō's force as it {{approached}} Savo Island near Guadalcanal. Taking the Japanese by surprise, Scott's warships sank one of Gotō's cruisers {{and one of his}} destroyers, heavily damaged another cruiser, mortally wounded Gotō, and forced the rest of Gotō's warships to abandon the bombardment mission and retreat. During the exchange of gunfire, one of Scott's destroyers was sunk and one cruiser and another destroyer were heavily damaged. In the meantime, the Japanese supply convoy successfully completed unloading at Guadalcanal and began its return journey without <b>being</b> <b>discovered</b> by Scott's force. Later on the morning of 12 October, four Japanese destroyers from the supply convoy turned back to assist Gotō's retreating, damaged warships.
