5000|$|The ride {{starts off}} at a slow spin, {{propelling}} the sweeps upward due to both centrifugal force and a pneumatic cylinder housed in the center shaft. The speed is increased until the cars reach their maximum height propelled by the motor then pneumatics are engaged. The operator will then begin to ("bounce" [...] or [...] "pop") the sweeps by sending the ride into a freewheel mode then hitting a zoom button that fills the center cylinder with air yanking the sweeps upward, when the operator let's off the button air is rapidly <b>blead</b> resulting in the sweeps dropping until the operator zooms the sweeps upward again. This is repeated multiple times before the ride tops off to its max allowable height. The operator can do a reverse pop of the sweeps to rapidly stabilize the bounce and disengage rotation until the ride begins to slow down for landing on the tower rim.|$|E

The general objective of the study is to find a business format for social entrepreneurship that seems to be suitable for the water sector in Bangladesh. This study uses the business model to study the success and survival of social enterprises in Bangladesh’s economies and water sector. The study employs previous academic study of social entrepreneurship development, hybrid non-profit model of social enterprises and leveraged not-for-profit model which are active in the water sector. Hybrid social venture combines the social welfare logic of nonprofits and the money making logic of a For-profit-business. <b>Bleading</b> (2013) says, hybrid social ventures are creative ways of solving real-world problems and these ventures harness the strength of both profitability and non-profit business models. Anyway, under the hybrid non-profit organization model, entrepreneurs set up non-profit business considering somewhat of cost recovery with the sale of goods and services. On the contrary, under the leveraged non-profit model, entrepreneurs set up a non-profit business to ensure the uses of innovation that address government failure or a market (Schwab Foundation).|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Non-steroid {{antiinflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection are {{two most}} important independent risk factors involved in the etiopathogenesis of gastroduodenal mucosal injury with a clear and critical role in both uncomplicated and complicated peptic ulcer disease. It is estimated that up to 90 % of all peptic ulcers result from the effect of {{one or both of}} these factors. AIM: To determine the frequency of NSAIDs use and Hp infection in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients and methods: Study evaluated data from 500 patients in whom esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed following presentation in emergency unit with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Anamnestic data was collected together with detailed information on previous salicilates and/or NSAIDs use. Hp status was determined and anatomic localization of bleeding lesion was also registered. Results: Acute upper GIT <b>bleading</b> was caused solely by NSAIDs in 55 (11 %), by aspirin in 66 (13. 2 %), while combined NSAID/aspirin therapy was identified in 19 (3. 8 %) of patients. In total NSAID and/or aspirin use were diagnosed in 139 (27. 8 %). while in 122 (24. 4 %) only Hp infection was diagnosed. Both risk factors were identified in 144 (28. 8 %) patients (Hp+NSAIDs in 12. 2 %, Hp+aspirin in 10. 8 % and Hp+aspirin+NSAIDs in 5. 8 %). In 19. 8 % of the cases (14 % of males and 27 % of females) neither NSAID/aspirin use nor presence of Hp infection was noted. Out of 500 patients enrolled, 63 % were mails. In females, bleeding lesion was most frequently localized in gastric mucosa, while males had equal chance of bleeding from either gastric or duodenal mucosa. Fortunately, only 5 to 7 % of patients were bleeding from both gastric and duodenal lesion. Conclusion : Prevention of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding can be achieved trough strict and limited use of aspirin and NSAIDs, eradication of Hp infection and use of gastroprotective therapy in well-defined risk patients that need chronic NSAIDs and/or aspirin therapy. In all patients starting long-term NSAID and/or aspirin therapy and all patients already on long-term aspirin therapy test and treat strategy for Hp infection should be used. On the other hand, only in high risk patients (more than 65 years, history of peptic ulcer disease, concomitant corticosteroid, aspirin, clopidogrel or warfarin therapy) already on chronic NSAID therapy long-term PPI therapy should be prescribed after testing and treating of Hp infection...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityHemorrhagic {{disorders}} {{designated by}} the term "purpura" are usually associated {{with the appearance of}} petechiae, ecchymoses, and lowered platelet counts. However, the mechanism of bleeding and the etiology remain unsolved. The cheek pouch of the hamster was used in an attempt to determine the cause of the bleeding under two conditions: first, in experimental purpura produced by antiplatelet serum prepared by repeated injections of hamster platelets into rabbits, and second, following infusion with dextran. Peripheral blood counts, bone marrow examinations, coagulation tests, and special tests for vascular fragility and hemostatic function (negative pressure, snake venom, and microelectrode) have been applied to normal hamsters as a basis for interpretation in hemorrhagic diathesis. Microscopic observations were made in vivo and recorded on Kodachrome motion picture film by means of cinephotomicrographic equipment. The results of previous blood counts and bone marrow examinations have been confirmed and analyzed more critically. Detailed observations have been made on the morphology of the blood cells in the stained smear and reticulocyte counts have been reported {{for the first time in}} the hamster. The red cell count in the hamster (6. 8 ± 1. 2 million per cu. mm.) is slightly higher than that in man, and the reticulocyte value is also higher (2. 5 ± 1. 2 per cent). The polymorphonuclear and lymphocytic values were reversed in the hamster (polymorphs 30 ± 6 per cent, lymphocytes 61 ± 7. 5 per cent). The peripheral blood smear showed moderate polychromatophilia and occasional target cells. The bone marrow of the hamster was more cellular than that of man, with a ratio of white cells to red cells of 8 : 1. The coagulation tests were within limits comparable with those for man. Three in vivo tests for vascular fragility and hemostatic function in the hamster cheek pouch were utilized: namely, the moccasin venom test (Fulton, Lutz, Shulman, and Arendt, in press); the negative pressure test (Shulman, Mode, Kagan, and Fulton, Anat. Rec. 118 : 408, 1954); and the microelectrode test (Fulton, Akers, and Lutz. Blood 8 : 140, 1953). The snake venom test applied to the cheek pouch of the normal hamster produced 71 ± 6 petechiae at one hour intervals and 138 ± 20 at the end of two hours. The negative pressure test produced from 0 to 4 petechiae at one minute Nith a negative pressure of 20 mm of mercury. The microelectrode test was used to evaluate the fragility of blood vessels by stimulation of the wall with single faradic shocks. Vasoconstriction occurred at low voltages (threshold, 4 to 10 volt single shock) in muscular arterioles and venules. The sphincters were more sensitive than other portions of the vascular network. White cell sticking and platelet thrombosis occurred at higher voltages (10 to 3 O volts). The vessel wall of normal hamsters was resistant even to very high voltages (150 volts). If normal vessels were ruptured, the broken ends were sealed immediately, probably by "electrocoagulation". The results of the microelectrode test were compared in young and "old age" hamsters. No significant differences were obtained except for an increase in white cell adhesiveness in the "old age" group. Hamsters of either sex and 75 to 100 grams in weight were splenectomized. The platelet counts increased daily for 4 to 6 days after splenectomy and gradually returned to normal on the 14 th to 18 th day. The smear of peripheral blood exhibited increased polychromatophilia, target cells, and clumps of platelets, particularly on the 4 th to 8 th day. Howell-Jolly bodies were absent. Changes in the bone marrow were not remarkable. The microelectrode test for thrombus susceptibility revealed a marked tendency for thrombosis, while the fragility threshold did not differ from that in normal hamsters. Experimental thrombocytopenic purpura in hamsters, caused by injection of antiplatelet serum, produced spontaneous purpura, ecchymoses and bleeding manifestations in the cheek pouch and in almost all organs of the body. The platelet counts were decreased and the bone marrow showed immature-like amorphic megakaryocytes. Bleeding times and clot retraction determinations were abnormal. Values for the bleeding time in excess of 240 seconds v-rere not uncommon (normal <b>bleading</b> time, 109 ± 19). The snake venom test produced profuse numbers of petechiae within one half hour. Stimulation of the blood vessel wall with low voltage produced platelet thrombi in normal hamsters. In thrombocytopenic hamsters, thrombus formation and leukocytic sticking did not occur even with high voltages. However, the vessel walls were fragile and rupture occurred at electric thresholds lower than 150 volts (60 to 140). These changes were more marked at 24 hours after treatment with antiplatelet serum than at two hours. Small repeated injections of antiplatelet serum produced similar results. In control experiments, hamsters were injected with serum obtained from normal rabbits and with saline solution. The test procedures showed no appreciable deviations from normal values. The fragility thresholds were normal. The splenectomized hamsters with elevated platelet counts were given antipletelet serum. The fragility threshold to electrical stimulation of the vessel wall was lowered and hemorrhage occurred at low voltages. Consequently, splenectomy and the concomitant increase in numbers of circulating platelets shed no protective effect in experimental purpura. Recently, detrimental reactions to plasma substitutes have been critically evaluated and the dextrans have been reported to cause a hemostatic defect in human beings. Dextran increased the bleeding time in normal volunteers as well as in patients with shock. The exact nature of the bleeding phenomenon has not been determined. The precise techniques available for the study of hemorrhage in the hamster cheek pouch have been used to evaluate the hemostatic defect caused by dextran and to observe in vivo the changes occurring in the formed elements of the blood end in the characteristics of the vessel wall. Hematological changes in the hamster after infusion with dextran were insignificant except for the effects of hemodilution and the clumping of platelets. The results of the various coagulation tests (clotting time, prothrombin time, clot retraction, and fibrinolysis test) were within normallimits. The bleeding time was prolonged significantly as shown by values of more than 240 seconds as compared with values of 109 ± 19 seconds in normal hamsters. All dextrans used in this study (Lares, Cutter) produced an increased bleeding time except Expandex. The Lares dextran seemed to be more detrimental than other types. After injection of Lares, increased numbers of leukocytes were adherent to the endothelium at 24 hours and during a period of 3 to 4 weeks. The thrombosis threshold was increased. The formation, canalization, and embolization of thrombi were recorded on Kodachrome motion picture film. The frag ility threshold, as tested with microelectrode and also snake venom, was lowered. The vascular defect was greater with Lares than with other dextrans. In conclusion, experimental purpura was produced in hamsters by antiplatelet serwn for the first time. The resultant bleeding phenomenon and hemostatic defect was related to lowered platelet counts and decreased frag ility of the vessel wall. Splenectomy accompanied by increased platelet counts was not remedial. The effects of dextran infusions in hamsters have been critically evaluated by routine hematological tests and by special tests for vascular fragility and hemostatic function. A defect in the vessel wall was shown by the lowered fragility to faradic stimulation. This finding provided the basis for a new explanation for the hemostatic defect, namely, damage to the vessel wall. This is in addition to the previously known factors of prolonged bleeding time and unexplained clumping of the platelets...|$|R
