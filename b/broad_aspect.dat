Everything {{that you}} can see in the world around you, {{presents}} itself to your eyes only as an arrangement of patches of different colors variously shaded.[1] Some of these patches of color have an appearance of lines or texture within them, as a piece of cloth or silk has of threads, or an animal's skin shows texture of hairs: but whether this be the case or not, the first <b>broad</b> <b>aspect</b> of the thing is that of a patch of some definite color; and the first thing to be learned is, how to produce extents of smooth color, without texture.|$|E

60|$|The {{scene in}} its <b>broad</b> <b>aspect</b> {{had so much}} of its {{previous}} character, even to the voices and rattle from the neighbouring village down, that it might for that matter have been the afternoon following the previously recorded episode. Change was only to be observed in details; but here {{it was obvious that}} a long procession of years had passed by. One of the two who walked the road was she who had figured as the young wife of Henchard on the previous occasion; now her face had lost much of its rotundity; her skin had undergone a textural change; and though her hair had not lost colour it was considerably thinner than heretofore. She was dressed in the mourning clothes of a widow. Her companion, also in black, appeared as a well-formed young woman about eighteen, completely possessed of that ephemeral precious essence youth, which is itself beauty, irrespective of complexion or contour.|$|E
6000|$|I quote these {{fragments}} from a gifted, if unpleasant, contemporary {{for what}} they are worth. I feel this has come in here as the <b>broad</b> <b>aspect</b> of this History. I come back to Mr. Polly sitting upon his gate and swearing in the east wind, and I so returning have a sense of floating across unbridged abysses between the General and the Particular. There, on the one hand, is the man of understanding, seeing clearly--I suppose he sees clearly--the big process that dooms millions of lives to thwarting and discomfort and unhappy circumstances, and giving us no help, no hint, by which we may get that better [...] "collective will and intelligence" [...] which would dam the stream of human failure, and, on the other hand, Mr. Polly sitting on his gate, untrained, unwarned, confused, distressed, angry, seeing nothing except that he is, as it were, nettled in greyness and discomfort--with life dancing all about him; Mr. Polly with a capacity for joy and beauty at least as keen and subtle as yours or mine.|$|E
60|$|The reader must not, {{from any}} {{testimony}} of mine, contract a dislike towards our slumberous stream. In {{the light of}} a calm and golden sunset it becomes lovely beyond expression; the more lovely for the quietude that so well accords with the hour, when even the wind, after blustering all day long, usually hushes itself to rest. Each tree and rock and every blade of grass is distinctly imaged, and, however unsightly in reality, assumes ideal beauty in the reflection. The minutest things of earth and the <b>broad</b> <b>aspect</b> of the firmament are pictured equally without effort and with the same felicity of success. All the sky glows downward at our feet; the rich clouds float through the unruffled bosom of the stream like heavenly thoughts through a peaceful heart. We will not, then, malign our river as gross and impure while it can glorify itself with so adequate a picture of the heaven that broods above it; or, if we remember its tawny hue and the muddiness of its bed, let it be a symbol that the earthiest human soul has an infinite spiritual capacity and may contain the better world within its depths. But, indeed, the same lesson might be drawn out of any mud-puddle in the streets of a city; and, being taught us everywhere, it must be true.|$|E

50|$|With active cancellation, {{the target}} generates a radar signal equal in {{intensity}} but opposite in phase {{to the predicted}} reflection of an incident radar signal (similarly to noise canceling ear phones). This creates destructive interference between the reflected and generated signals, resulting in reduced RCS. To incorporate active cancellation techniques, the precise characteristics of the waveform and angle of arrival of the illuminating radar signal must be known, since they define the nature of generated energy required for cancellation. Except against simple or low frequency radar systems, the implementation of active cancellation techniques is extremely difficult due to the complex processing requirements {{and the difficulty of}} predicting the exact nature of the reflected radar signal over a <b>broad</b> <b>aspect</b> of an aircraft, missile or other target.|$|E

5000|$|Psychologist Linda Gottfredson criticises the unempirical {{nature of}} triarchic theory. Further, she argues it is absurd {{to assert that}} {{traditional}} intelligence tests are not measuring practical intelligence, given that they show a moderate correlation with income, especially at middle age when individuals {{have had a chance}} to reach their maximum career potential, and an even higher correlation with occupational prestige, and that IQ tests predict the ability to stay out of jail and stay alive (all of which qualifies as practical intelligence or [...] "street smarts"). Gottfredson claims that what Sternberg calls practical intelligence is not a <b>broad</b> <b>aspect</b> of cognition at all but simply a specific set of skills people learn to cope with a specific environment (task specific knowledge).|$|E
50|$|The church's {{interior}} has a <b>broad</b> <b>aspect</b> {{with three}} wide bays {{leading up to}} the apse. The walls are dominated by red brick, which is contrasted with black brick, mastic and red and yellow glazed tiles which link the floor to the lower walls. The nave is lined with short granite columns, each with carved capitals by W. Pearce, which support arcades of notched and moulded bricks. The capitals are illustrated with carvings of parables and miracles. At the clerestory end are three-light windows in the first two bays and plate tracery in the third. The chancel is separated from the nave by a prominent arch. Unlike the nave, it is groined in brick and is extensively decorated with mosaic and inlaid marble. The design of the sanctuary thus makes it a distinctively darker and more elaborately mysterious area of the church.|$|E
50|$|CLT {{can also}} be used to explain stereotypes. The abstractness of the {{representations}} we have of people or groups can change our judgment of people who do not fit in the same categories as ourselves and are therefore more socially distant. For example, when viewing a different group of people in a more distant or high-level way, one may easily use abstract or centralized views. Viewing a group of teenagers in the mall, an adult may think that they are up to no good, or that they are trouble-makers. This is an overall abstract and centralized view focused only on one <b>broad</b> <b>aspect</b> of the group. These views are usually incorrect, and can lead to stereotypes and discrimination. Similarly, thinking of others on the lower level, such as people that the individual knows personally (i.e., less distant people), allows for more detailed ideas and perceptions of those people. Therefore, these perceptions are often more correct and less likely to create or strengthen stereotypes. The more social distance there is between groups, the more it increases discrimination against groups that are racially or sexually different from ourselves. When people are categorized in such a way that is distinctly different from oneself (that is, psychologically distant from the self) and are thus viewed in more abstract terms, there tend to be more negative effects. Increasing other types of psychological distance (e.g., temporal, spatial) can increase social distance between groups, leading to more of these negative intergroup outcomes.|$|E

40|$|The three {{convective}} instability models that aim {{to account for}} the <b>broad</b> <b>aspect</b> ratio of meso-scale cellular convection (MCC) are compared with a simple analytical version of the mesoscale entrainment instability (MEI) model proposed by Fiedler (1984). The inadequacies of the convective models are demonstrated. In the ME 1 model, the MCC is generated from above by a mesoscale instability in the entrainment fluxes. ME 1 is able {{to account for the}} <b>broad</b> <b>aspect</b> ratio of MCC. However the predicted growth rate for ME 1 is only of order 10 ' s I. which may be too small to account for the amplitude of MCC. Tactics are discussed for making aircraft observations that could reveal whether MCC is generated by ME 1 or by convection within the mixed layer. 1...|$|E
