40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the halt of price {{discovery}} function in the financial markets and the evaporation of market liquidity. We explore the mechanism of these phenomena by using simulation techniques shown in Muranaga and Shimizu (1999). In order to generate evaporation of market liquidity, we exogenously reduce traders ’ expected values of asset. In one simulation, it is assumed that market participants do not amend their expectations on future price levels in response to large movements in market prices, but instead become more uncertain about whether the expectations would be realised. The simulation result shows that the loss of market liquidity can play a role of a <b>built-in</b> <b>stabiliser</b> in the market, and can prevent a precipitous drop in prices. As uncertainty increases, market participants become less willing to trade, the number of orders declined, and, consequently, market liquidity evaporates. When market liquidity is low, price discovery is not conducted as often, so an endogenous (secondary) crash in prices is less likely to develop. In another simulation, it is assumed that market participants amend their expectations on future prices in response to large price movements and uncertainty remains unchanged. In this case, the simulation result suggests that secondary crashes might develop. This is because order flows, which would not be interrupted, coul...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the lessons}} of the post- 2007 housing crisis, it would be {{dangerous}} to suggest {{that there will be no}} similar future events. This thesis examines a set of issues related to both past and future housing market volatility and trends. There are three central chapters (in addition to the Introduction and concluding chapters). The first substantive chapter extends the standard life-cycle housing approach to a three-asset model which incorporates interactions with financial markets and uncertainty; it can be shown that endogenous housing cycles can explain volatility. Three parameters drive the system -the income and price elastidties of housing demand and the degree of risk aversion. UK policy has attempted to increase housing supply to stabilise affordability, but the model demonstrates that stabilisation is unlikely through this route. However, it derives an alternative <b>built-in</b> <b>stabiliser</b> operating via an endogenous risk premium, frequently ignored in housing, which affects house price volatility. The second substantive chapter also uses the three asset model, but concentrates on the determinants of the equilibrium debt to income ratio for households. This indicator is particularly important for macro stabilisation purposes, but historically has exhibited a strong upward trend and no signs of an obvious equilibri urn. The chapter examines why this might be the case and derives formal conditions for the equilibrium. Chapter 4 turns to the sub-national level and examines regional and local markets. The key question is whether spatial variations in mortgage indebtedness are positively related to differences in house price volatility. This is primarily an empirical chapter, utilising newly constructed data on mortgage debt. ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} that inflation {{is generated by}} a combination of excess demand and inflationary expectations. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} present a simple combined model of wage and price inflation that incorporates these two features in a consistent manner. The model is constructed so as to pay particular attention to open economy features. The general characteristics of the model are derived from the static neoclassical theory of firms and households. To this structure we add the following dynamic adjustment assumptions: tradeable prices adjust immediately to world tradeable prices adjusted for the exchange rate, while wages and non-tradeable prices adjust to existing and anticipated excess demands in their respective markets. This procedure leads to a pair of excess demand-expectations equations in wages and non-tradeable prices. Empirically, we measure expectations about any given variable at any point in time as an optimal extrapolative function of past observations on itself. The system, as constructed, therefore contains three levels of information about the wage-price relationship: past information; information contained in the model itself; and, any additional information contained in the contemporaneous covariance of wages and non-tradeable prices. All three levels of information are used in estimating the system by a variant of Zellner’s seemingly unrelated regressions technique. In general terms the simple model appears to fit the data quite well and the theoretical properties of the system are supported by the estimates. This framework allows at least two interpretations of the long-run Phillips curve relationship between wage inflation and unemployment. The first concerns a situation in which the exchange rate is fixed. In this case, the domestic cycle of wages and non-tradeable prices has a <b>built-in</b> <b>stabiliser</b> around the trend of world tradeable prices. Of course the world price trend may itself be destabilising in some instances. Nevertheless, taking the world price trend as given we can define a long-run trade off relative to this trend. We call this the fixed-exchange-rate trade off. Attempts to exploit this trade off to lower unemployment would involve domestic inflation of non-tradeable prices at a rate in excess of the world tradeable price trend. The second concerns a situation in which the exchange rate moves over time in such a way as to preserve purchasing power parity. We call this the fixed-relative-price trade off. It could equally be called a variable-exchange-rate trade off. The data for Australia in the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s suggest that Australia faces a vertical long-run fixed-relative-price trade off but a negatively-sloped long-run fixed-exchange-rate trade off. Thus, if the authorities could maintain, with a fixed exchange rate, a long-run inflation rate for non-tradeables that is divergent from the world inflation rate for tradeables, then some long term gain in unemployment could be achieved at the expense of a higher rate of inflation. While this assumption would be untenable to most economists, the essence of this result is that the fixed exhange rate decreases the slope of the trade off over the time horizon relevant to policy-makers. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we formalize {{budgetary}} stabilisers {{as a set}} of simple policy rules, and assess their operation in an uncertain environment by performing stochastic simulations in a forward-looking multi-country macroeconometric model, NiGEM, comprising individual blocks for 10 Euroland economies. Automatic stabilisers make output volatility decrease by 11 per cent for Euroland as a whole – less than in previous studies, as these have overemphasised demand shocks. We also find that, provided countries comply with their announced fiscal consolidation programmes, <b>built-in</b> <b>stabilisers</b> and the Stability and Growth Pact are broadly compatible...|$|R
30|$|To these {{discretionary}} {{fiscal policy}} measures must be added {{the fact the}} Danish economy due to its rather high tax level and the large share of the workforce covered by unemployment benefits, {{has some of the}} largest <b>built-in</b> automatic <b>stabilisers</b> in the EU, cf. Figure  4 (Dolls et al, 2009). Thus the effects of the economic downturn on income and unemployment are significantly dampened. The backside of this is of course that the public budgets have deteriorated rather dramatically during the crisis.|$|R
40|$|Under the Stability and Growth Pact, {{countries}} {{are committed to}} achieve medium-term budget positions of "close to balance or in surplus". The rationale for this commitment is that such budgetary positions would allow for the full working of the <b>built-in</b> <b>stabilisers</b> without triggering the sanctions procedures of the Pact. The paper sets out to show how quantifications of the medium-term ("structural") requirement can accommodate the desired aim and suggests how fiscal measurement and forecasting errors {{as well as the}} budgetary effects of ageing may be allowed for. All in all, broadly balanced budgets in the medium term appear to be "roughly right" for most euro-area countries. Of course, as the cyclical behaviour of the euro-area economy adapts to the new EMU environment, the medium-term targets will need to be addressed again.
