40|$|It is {{well-known}} that Turbo codes are very useful in digital communications. However, {{due to the}} existence of interleaver/deinterleaver, there is no effective way available to test the correctness of the 'turbo' algorithms in practical use such as FPGA/DSP implementation, especially in very low bit error rate. In this paper, based on the extractable theoretical bounds for interleaver <b>by-passed</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>a</b> simple but effective testing method is proposed by separating the turbo coder into interleaver/ deinterleaver part and soft-in soft-out (SISO) -iterative decoding part. Our analysis and simulation results for turbo code shows that the proposed method brings no extra cost in implementation and is proved to be practical and effective. In principle, the proposed method can be generalized to almost all turbo or turbo-like systems, in which the theoretical bounds can be extracted in the absence of interleaver/de-interleaver. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Objective Oxygen delivery, {{underpinned}} by vascular tone, is {{the principle}} limiting factor {{in the study of}} skeletal muscle physiology, particularly during muscle contraction. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an autologous perfused rat hind limb preparation for the study of skeletal muscle contractile function. Methods Adult Wistar rats were surgically prepared using <b>a</b> <b>by-pass</b> <b>system</b> for pump-controlled arterial blood flow to, and venous return from the hind limb during periods of quiescence and twitch contraction of the gastrocnemius-plantaris-soleus muscle bundle. Results During rest, hind limb perfusion pressure (102 ± 5 mmHg) was not different to systemic arterial pressure (99 ± 4 mmHg). Hind limb pressure was responsive to vasoconstrictors and vasodilators (± 50 mmHg). The arterial PO 2 (100 ± 3 mmHg), O 2 saturation, and acid–base balance (pH: 7. 42 ± 0. 01) contributed to resting hind limb (a-v) O 2 difference (4. 8 ± 0. 5 mL/ 100 mL) and VO 2 (0. 31 ± 0. 03 μmol/g/min wet weight). Repetitive isometric twitch tension (1 Hz, 0. 05 ms, 10 minutes) was best maintained at a flow rate of 2 mL/min (VO 2 increased fivefold during muscle contraction) and efficiency of oxygen use increased from 0. 27 ± 0. 08 – 0. 52 ± 0. 07 N/μmol/min. Conclusion The autologous rat hind limb provided resting vascular tone allowing maintenance of perfusion pressure at flows within the physiological range. Oxygen delivery supported repetitive twitch contractions and facilitated measurement of active metabolism...|$|R
