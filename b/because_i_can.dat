Barkley responded by taking blame for letting time lapse on the repayment of the debt and promptly paid the casino. After repaying his debt, Barkley stated during a pregame show on TNT, [...] "I've got to stop gambling...I am not going to gamble anymore. For right now, the next year or two, I'm not going to gamble... Just <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> afford to lose money doesn't mean I should do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Jaws set the {{template}} for many subsequent horror films, {{to the extent}} that the script for Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction film Alien was pitched to studio executives as [...] "Jaws in space". Scott would later reveal in a 2017 interview that Jaws had made a lasting impression, [...] "I was always put off from swimming ever since I watched Jaws," [...] says Scott. [...] "I quite liked swimming, actually, and I'd occasionally dive, but once I saw Jaws there was no way I was ever going to learn to surf – no way! <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> imagine my legs, my little pinkies hanging underneath the surfboard and I know I'm going to be the one." ...|$|E
500|$|Jacqui {{has never}} had an affair in the serial, of her {{morality}} Cooper states: [...] "It's all about family for Jacqui and she's never cheated on any of her sisters. She's got morals and this isn't good enough." [...] Cooper has also spoke of her confusion of the audiences perception that Jacqui is [...] "a bitch" [...] when she has strong morals. Cooper has said she is proud of Jacqui's wardrobe {{because it is not}} glam. She brands her as the complete opposite of the [...] "honey image" [...] the serial sometimes becomes associated with. Describing how she plays Jacqui she states: [...] "It's great playing Jacqui <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> just be completely grotesque and over the top, snarling and grunting." ...|$|E

500|$|Watson told Ellen DeGeneres {{just before}} {{graduation}} {{that it took}} five years to finish instead of four because, due to her acting work, she [...] "ended up taking two full semesters off". On 25 May 2014, she graduated from Brown University with a bachelor's degree in English literature. In 2013, she became certified to teach yoga and meditation. As part of this certification, she attended a week-long meditation course at a Canadian facility, in which residents {{are not allowed to}} speak, in order [...] "to figure out how to be at home with myself". She told Elle Australia that an uncertain future meant finding [...] "a way to always feel safe and at home within myself. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never rely on a physical place." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{divergent}} {{views were}} expressed about Puck and Beiste's performance of [...] "Mean". Crystal Bell of Huffington Post asked, [...] "How {{could you not}} be moved by their duet in the auditorium?" [...] E! Online's Jenna Mullins called it [...] "one {{of the highlights of}} the season", and Slezak gave it a grade of [...] "A". Chaney's [...] "B+" [...] followed her statement that [...] "it was more effective than Swift's version <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> believe that both Puck and Beiste have had it rough", and Strecker described it as [...] "lovely and thematically perfect" [...] and gave it a [...] "B". VanDerWerff said he [...] "could have done without" [...] their duet, and Futterman was even harsher: [...] "it was quite unfortunate". Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson wrote that he [...] "sort of liked" [...] how the pair were [...] "simultaneously improving upon and butchering a Taylor Swift song", and Saskin characterized it as [...] "heartfelt and passionate".|$|E
500|$|Spears {{originally}} envisioned [...] "Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary", {{but felt}} {{all right with}} her label's producers, since [...] "It made more sense to go pop, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> dance to it—it's more me." [...] The album opens with the first single [...] "...Baby One More Time", a teen pop and dance-pop song that begins with a three-note motif in the bass range of the piano. The opening was compared to many other songs, such as [...] "We Will Rock You" [...] (1977), [...] "Start Me Up" [...] (1981), [...] "These Words" [...] (2004) and the theme song of the film Jaws {{due to the fact}} the track [...] "makes its presence known in exactly one second". According to magazine Blender, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] is composed by [...] "wah-wah guitar lines and EKG-machine bass-slaps". Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, authors of Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide (2008), observed that the lyrics of the song [...] "gesture toward [...] longing for the return of an ex-boyfriend." [...] The next song and third single, [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] runs through a moderately slow dance beat, and has a rhythm and blues melody mixed with edgy synthesized instrumentals. The third track and second single [...] "Sometimes" [...] is a ballad, that Spears begins with [...] "You tell me you're in love with me/That you can't take your pretty eyes away from me/It's not that I don't wanna stay/But every time you come too close I move away". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted the song has [...] "a catchy hook and endearing melody, with a reminiscent euro-dance rhythm." ...|$|E
5000|$|Also {{regarding}} his tumor, he stated: [...] "I'm {{not at all}} frightened. I know the risks. The odds of people not even surviving the treatment are 20-1, but that doesn't bother me. I've backed a few 20-1 winners in my time. One in four people get cancer, and I'm pleased it's me and not somebody else in my family.

500|$|In June 1997, Spears was {{in talks}} with manager Lou Pearlman to join female pop group Innosense. Lynne Spears asked family friend and {{entertainment}} lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph {{decided he wanted to}} pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song from Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and [...] "there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany." [...] Two weeks later, executives from JIVE Records returned calls to Rudolph. Senior vice president of A Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that [...] "It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'— is extremely important. And Britney had that." [...] They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from [...] "lower and less poppy" [...] delivery to [...] "distinctively, unmistakably Britney." [...] After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned [...] "Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary" [...] but felt all right with her label's appointment of producers, since [...] "It made more sense to go pop, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> dance to it—it's more me." [...] She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others.|$|E
2500|$|When Valerio Fioravanti, a Neo-fascist {{and fellow}} Poggioreale inmate {{serving time for}} {{political}} terrorism asked Cutolo {{the reason for his}} charisma, he replied: [...] "Naples is divided into lords and beggars. If i have charisma, it is <b>because</b> <b>i</b> <b>can</b> offer a prompt promotion from the second category to the first one".|$|E
2500|$|Sachs also {{described}} Naomi as a layered character whose nature would be explored as the series progressed. With regard to playing such roles, McCord stated, [...] "I tend {{to reach out}} to people like Clark <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see they are putting on a facade and are not as bad as they seem. They will eventually let their guard down and become nice people." [...] The actress opted not to review the original series before beginning her role in the spin-off, expressing a desire for Naomi to have her own identity.|$|E

2500|$|Baker is cynical of {{religion}} and describes himself as irreligious, or occasionally as Buddhist, but not anti-religious. He states: [...] "People are quite happy believing the wrong things. I wasn't unhappy believing all that shit. Now I'm not unhappy thinking about it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> laugh at it." [...] Politically, Baker has expressed disdain for both the Conservatives and the Labour Party, saying in 1998: [...] "When the Conservatives were in I cannot {{tell you how much}} I hated them. But I realise how shallow I am because I now hate the Labour Party as much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before her}} death, Binchy told The Irish Times: [...] "I don't {{have any regrets}} about any roads I didn't take. Everything went well, and I think that's been a help <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> look back, and I do get great {{pleasure}} out of looking back... I've been very lucky and I have a happy old age with good family and friends still around." [...] Just before dying, she read her latest short story at the Dalkey Book Festival. She once said {{she would like to}} die [...] "...on my 100th birthday, piloting Gordon and myself into the side of a mountain".|$|E
2500|$|In September 1992, {{the tabloid}} {{television}} show Hard Copy broadcast a secretly videotaped conversation between Fisher and Paul Makely, {{the owner of}} a gym in Massapequa. In the tape, recorded hours before she agreed to the plea in court, Fisher could be seen talking about her future, saying that she wanted to get married to Makely so he could visit her in prison. Fisher explained that her lawyer believed requiring people to be married for such visits was unconstitutional, and that she intended to challenge the law on this matter. Fisher could be seen on the tape saying: [...] "That will keep my name in the press. I want my name in the press. Why? <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make a lot of money. I figure if I'm going through all this pain and suffering, I'm getting a Ferrari." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{activities}} like dumpster diving or gleaning are traditionally seen as subsistence {{strategies for the}} poor, most research on freegans finds that individuals come from middle-class and upper-class backgrounds and {{have high levels of}} education (even if their present lifestyles make them low-income). Freeganism has also been described as racially exclusive, because freegan's voluntary association of waste would seem to confirm a [...] "globally ubiquitous racial construction" [...] that people of color are dirty and polluted. As one freegan of color wrote, [...] "I am extremely embarrassed for people to see me diving, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell that I’m not just me, I’m also a representation of black people in general...I got harassed by security several times while diving on my own campus, until my white friends pop their heads out of the dumpsters." [...] In contrast, the portrait of the gender balance of freeganism is more mixed, with some accounts saying groups are majority men and others majority women.|$|E

I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when.
