5|$|After {{signing a}} three-year contract, worth $850,000 per {{year with the}} Canucks on May 4, 2006, <b>Bourdon</b> earned {{a spot on the}} team's 2006–07 opening roster. He played his first NHL game on October 10, 2006 against the Minnesota Wild, but after playing nine games and scoring no points, he was sent again to the QMJHL for further development. On January 8, 2007, <b>Bourdon</b> was again traded in the QMJHL, with Moncton sending him to the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles in {{exchange}} for Mark Barberio and a first round selection in the 2007 QMJHL draft. As a Screaming Eagle, <b>Bourdon</b> lost in the QMJHL semi-final against his former team, Val-d'Or. He finished the 2006–07 QMJHL season with 20 points in 36 games. When the Canucks did not qualify for the playoffs, they sent <b>Bourdon</b> to play five games for the Manitoba Moose, who {{were in the middle of}} the AHL playoffs. He was held pointless through five AHL playoff games. Including his participation in the 2007 World Junior Championships, <b>Bourdon</b> played for five different teams throughout the 2006–07 season.|$|E
5|$|Burrows was {{the closest}} friend on the Canucks to former {{teammate}} Luc <b>Bourdon,</b> {{who died in a}} motorcycle accident in May 2008. In the hockey season following his death, Burrows occasionally celebrated goals with a bow-and-arrow mime, a gesture that <b>Bourdon</b> himself did after scoring during his junior career. He and his wife (girlfriend at the time) remained close to Bourdon's girlfriend, Charlene Ward.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Luc <b>Bourdon</b> (February 16, 1987 – May 29, 2008) was a Canadian {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} defenceman {{who played for}} the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manitoba Moose, from 2006 until 2008. After overcoming childhood arthritis, he was selected third overall in the 2003 Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) draft and played for the Val-d'Or Foreurs, Moncton Wildcats, and Cape Breton Screaming Eagles, spending four seasons in the QMJHL. The Canucks drafted <b>Bourdon</b> with their first selection, tenth overall, in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. Noted as a strong defenceman who could contribute on offence, <b>Bourdon</b> represented Canada in three international tournaments, winning two gold medals at the IIHF World U20 Championship and a silver medal at the IIHF World U18 Championship. <b>Bourdon</b> {{died at the age}} of 21 near his hometown of Shippagan, New Brunswick, when his motorcycle collided with a tractor trailer.|$|E
5|$|As a {{young and}} {{promising}} defenceman, <b>Bourdon</b> was regularly mentioned in rumours of trades for more offence at the forward positions. Most significantly, he was speculated {{to be part of}} a package in exchange for Tampa Bay Lightning forward Brad Richards. Although <b>Bourdon</b> had a powerful shot, he did not play defence responsibly enough to earn a regular spot on the roster. He began to show signs of improvement and maturity as the Canucks used him more in the 2007–08 season.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bourdon</b> {{joined the}} Val-d'Or Foreurs for the 2003–04 season, {{registering}} eight points in 64 regular season games and scoring one goal in seven playoff games. He appeared in all 70 {{games with the}} Foreurs in 2004–05, scoring 13 goals and 19 assists, and participated in the CHL Top Prospects Game, an exhibition for draft-eligible players. In June 2005, <b>Bourdon</b> was the tenth pick overall, selected by the Vancouver Canucks, at the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. Ranked sixth overall for North American skaters coming into the draft, <b>Bourdon</b> was noted as a physical two-way defenceman with significant offensive skills and a strong shot, {{as well as an}} excellent skater. He was the second Shippagan-born hockey player to be drafted in the NHL, after goaltender Yanick Degrace was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in 1991.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bourdon</b> {{made his}} {{international}} debut representing Team Canada in the 2005 World Under-18 Championships, {{held in the}} Czech Republic, earning one assist in a silver-medal effort.|$|E
5|$|Invited to the Canucks {{training}} camp, <b>Bourdon</b> {{almost made}} {{the team as}} an 18-year-old, but instead was returned to the QMJHL for further development. He began the 2005–06 season with the Foreurs, registering 20 points in 20 games, before being traded to the Moncton Wildcats, who were hosting the 2006 Memorial Cup. In exchange for <b>Bourdon,</b> the Wildcats sent Ian Mathieu-Girard, Jean-Sébastien Adam, a fourth-round pick, and a first-round selection in 2008 to Val-d'Or. Shortly after the trade, <b>Bourdon</b> injured his ankle, suffering a fractured fibula, high and low sprains, and a second-degree ligament tear. Although he returned to join Moncton in the playoffs, doctors {{told him that it}} would take two years to fully recover. He managed a full recovery after one year, but his turning ability and backwards skating sometimes lagged. Competing in the Memorial Cup, he reached the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) final with the Wildcats, who lost 6–2 to the Quebec Remparts.|$|E
5|$|The American Hockey League, where <b>Bourdon</b> {{had played}} for the Manitoba Moose, {{observed}} {{a moment of silence}} in Bourdon's honour prior to game one of the Calder Cup Finals between the Chicago Wolves and the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins just hours after the accident, and on May 31, the Pittsburgh Penguins and Detroit Red Wings observed a moment of silence before game four of the 2008 Stanley Cup Final. During the 2008 NHL Draft, the Canucks' management wore guitar pins to remember <b>Bourdon,</b> because he was an avid guitarist.|$|E
5|$|A <b>bourdon</b> or knobbed {{staff is}} shown behind {{the arms of}} some priors and prioresses {{as a symbol of}} office {{analogous}} to the crosier. Arms of priors from the 15th century had a banner surrounding the shield, but today this is often a rosary.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bourdon</b> House {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{properties}} in Mayfair. It was constructed by Thomas Barlow between 1723–5 as part of the original development plan. An additional storey was added around 1864-5. In 1909, the 2nd Duke of Westminster ordered major refurbishments and the expansion of a three-storey wing. He moved out of Grosvenor House in 1916 into this, where he stayed until his death in 1953.|$|E
5|$|American {{rock band}} Linkin Park has {{released}} seven studio albums, five live albums, two compilation albums, two remix albums, three soundtrack albums, 12 video albums, 10 extended plays, 35 singles, 20 promotional singles, and 66 music videos. Linkin Park {{was formed in}} Agoura Hills, California in 1996 by Mike Shinoda (vocals and guitars), Brad Delson (guitar), and Rob <b>Bourdon</b> (drums). Joe Hahn (turntables) and Dave Farrell (bass) were later recruited, and in 1999, Chester Bennington (lead vocals) became a member, staying with the band {{until his death in}} 2017.|$|E
5|$|Born on February 16, 1987, <b>Bourdon</b> was an {{only child}} raised by his mother, Suzanne Boucher, in the small French-speaking {{community}} of Shippagan, New Brunswick. When he was nine, he was diagnosed with juvenile arthritis and needed to use a wheelchair, which he later overcame. As a teenager, he attended Marie-Esther Secondary, where he was a straight-A student. Growing up in a fishing town, he worked summers on his uncle's crab fishing boat.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bourdon</b> {{was killed}} {{instantly}} in a motorcycle collision in Lamèque, New Brunswick, near {{his hometown of}} Shippagan on May 29, 2008, when he hit a tractor-trailer after losing control of his 2009 Suzuki GSX-R1000 and crossing the centre line. Environment Canada showed winds gusting to more than 50km/h (31mph) in the area {{at the time of}} the accident. The RCMP stated that Bourdon's inexperience with motorcycles may have been a factor in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I, the British {{upper class}} was in decline as the reduced {{workforce}} meant servants were less in supply and demanded higher salaries. The grandest houses in Mayfair became {{more expensive to}} service and consequently many were converted to foreign embassies. The 2nd Duke of Westminster decided to demolish Grosvenor House and build <b>Bourdon</b> House in its place. Mayfair attracted commercial development after much of the City of London was destroyed during the Blitz, and many corporate headquarters were established in the area. Several historically important houses were demolished, including Aldford House, Londonderry House and Chesterfield House.|$|E
5|$|He {{played as}} a 13- and 14-year-old with the Peninsule Acadien Lynx, {{and with the}} Miramichi Rivermen from ages 15–16, both local minor ice hockey teams. After being the third overall choice in the 2003 QMJHL draft, <b>Bourdon</b> left home when he was 16, {{returning}} in the off-season {{to live with his}} mother. Upon turning professional and signing his first contract, he anonymously donated C$10,000 to the local minor hockey association for families who could not afford equipment. His donation was posthumously revealed by his former bantam hockey coach, Gilles Cormier, who managed the local arena at the time of Bourdon's death.|$|E
5|$|The Hunting Party was {{recorded}} at the Larrabee Sound Studios, located in Hollywood, Los Angeles. During the recording for the band's sixth studio album, the band would spend {{five or six}} days a week at the Larrabee Studios working on the record. The Hunting Party was also recorded in part at EastWest Studios, also located in Hollywood. There, drummer Rob <b>Bourdon</b> and Shinoda would record drums and percussion for the album. The band would also record other material for the album at EastWest on occasion.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} album Blood Fire Death, {{one of the}} first {{definitive}} Viking metal releases, Bathory incorporated a diverse range of musical elements. While retaining the noise and chaos of previous recordings, the band took a more sorrowful and melodic approach, working in ballads based on Germanic and Norse folklore, shanty-like melodies and folk music elements such as <b>bourdon</b> sounds, Jew's harps, and fifes. Bathory added natural found sounds, such as ocean waves, thunder, and wild animal noises, in a style similar to that of musique concrète. Instruments were sometimes used to create onomatopoeic effects such as drum sounds imitating thunder or a sledgehammer. The songs typically featured multi-sectional formal structures, following a pattern of three instrumental sections– introduction, bridge, and finale– and two vocal sections– stanza and refrain.|$|E
5|$|The voice cast of {{the game}} {{consists}} of Clancy Brown as Doctor Neo Cortex and Uka Uka, Mel Winkler as Aku Aku, Kevin Michael Richardson as Crunch Bandicoot and an advisor of Velo, Debi Derryberry as Coco Bandicoot and Polar, Steven Blum as Emperor Velo XXVII and Crash Bandicoot, Billy West as Nash and Zam, Dwight Schultz as Dingodile and Fake Crash, Marshall R. Teague as Krunk, John DiMaggio as Tiny Tiger, Michael Ensign as Doctor Nefarious Tropy, Quinton Flynn as Doctor N. Gin and Nitrous Oxide, André Sogliuzzo as Norm and Zem, Paul Greenberg as Geary and Pura and Tom <b>Bourdon</b> as N. Trance and an advisor of Velo.|$|E
25|$|In 1831, <b>Bourdon,</b> {{combined}} Budan's theorem and Lagrange's {{continued fraction}} method for approximating real roots of polynomials and, thus, gave {{a preview of}} Vincent's method, without actually giving credit to him. As Vincent mentions {{in the very first}} sentence of his 1834 papers, and 1836 <b>Bourdon</b> used (in his book) a joint presentation of theirs.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating in}} 1995, Delson, Shinoda and <b>Bourdon</b> formed Xero, which would {{eventually}} become {{the starting point}} for Linkin Park.|$|E
25|$|Rob <b>Bourdon</b> of Linkin Park uses two Pintech pads on {{the left}} of his kit, with {{different}} snare sounds triggered.|$|E

25|$|New Ulm's {{glockenspiel}} {{is one of}} the world's few free-standing carillon clock towers. It stands 45 feet high, and {{its largest}} <b>Bourdon</b> (bell) weighs 595 pounds while the total weight of the bells is two tons. The bells chime the time of day in Westminster style.|$|E
25|$|Carillon {{music is}} {{typically}} written on two staves. Notes {{written in the}} bass clef are generally played by the feet. Notes written in the treble clef are played with the hands. Pedals range from the lowest note (the <b>bourdon)</b> and may continue up to two and half octaves. In the North American Standard keyboard, all notes can be played on the manual.|$|E
25|$|Brad Delson {{attended}} Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, {{an affluent}} suburb of Los Angeles, with childhood friend and Linkin Park band mate Mike Shinoda. He played in various bands throughout {{his high school}} career, the most notable being Relative Degree, in which he met and teamed up with drummer Rob <b>Bourdon.</b> Relative Degree's goal was simply to play a show, and, after achieving that goal, they disbanded.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Poussin's death, his style had a strong influence on French art, thanks in particular to Charles LeBrun, who had studied briefly with Poussin in Rome, and who, like Poussin, became a court painter for the King and later {{the head of the}} French Academy in Rome. Poussin's work had an important influence on the 17th-century paintings of Jacques Stella and Sébastien <b>Bourdon,</b> the Italian painter Pier Francesco Mola, and the Dutch painter Gerard de Lairesse.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} 23 bells {{were installed}} in 1856 and make-up the oldest carillon in North America. They {{were made in}} France, and each has a name related to Mary. The final bell, {{which is one of}} the grandest in the United States, was blessed in 1888, during Father Sorin's Golden jubilee. It is named for St. Anthony of Padua, it is an immense bass bell, or <b>bourdon,</b> more than seven feet tall and weighing 15,400 pounds.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>bourdon</b> tube, diaphragm, {{and digital}} depth gauges may require {{adjustment}} for use at altitude. Capillary gauges {{have been shown}} to be a conservative method for measurement of compensated depth at altitude. Modern dive computers detect changes in altitude or accept it as a user input and automatically adjust their calculation of a safe decompression regime for a dive at that altitude. If an altitude-aware computer is not used, altitude decompression tables must be used.|$|E
25|$|The eight {{large windows}} at the nave {{together}} with the other six at the transept and two at the sacristy are arched. There were originally eight large {{windows at the}} transept until the walling up of the two fronting Victoria Street. The original timber louvred casements of the windows were replaced by glass shutters with green glass in 1937. The stained glass windows in the lunettes of the nave and transept windows were presented to the cathedral by Bishop Charles Arsène <b>Bourdon.</b>|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} Bonarda/Douce noir {{has been known}} {{under a variety of}} {{synonyms}} including: Alcantino, Aleante, Batiolin, Bathiolin (in Albertville), Blaue Gansfuesser, Bonarda (in Argentina), <b>Bourdon</b> noir, Carbonneau, Charbonneau (in Jura), Charbono (in California), Corbeau (in the Ain and Isère departments as well as Jura), Cot Merille, Cot Rouge Merille, Cote Rouge, Dolcetto Grosso, Dolutz, Douce noire, Folle Noire d L'Ariege, Grenoblois, Korbo, Mauvais noir, Ocanette, Picot Rouge, Plant de Calarin, Plant de Montmelion, Plant de Savoie, Plant de Turin (in Jura), Plant noir (in the Haute-Savoie department), Turca (in the Trentino region of Italy), Turin (in Jura) and Turino.|$|E
25|$|Suffering {{numerous}} {{injuries to}} {{players in the}} 2007–08 season, the Canucks struggled and finished three points out of a playoff spot. The {{final game of the}} season, a 7–1 loss to the Calgary Flames, marked Trevor Linden's last NHL game, as the former Canucks' all-time leading scorer retired. Having missed the playoffs {{for the second time in}} three years, the team underwent numerous personnel changes in the off-season. After Nonis was fired and replaced with former player agent Mike Gillis in April 2008, longtime Canucks captain Markus Naslund, as well as Brendan Morrison, were let go via free agency. Also in the off-season, on May 29, 2008, the Canucks lost defensive prospect Luc <b>Bourdon</b> to a fatal motorcycle crash near his hometown of Shippagan, New Brunswick.|$|E
25|$|Harding {{left the}} lead {{locomotive}} No.5017 running to keep air pressure supplied to the train's air brakes and also applied {{a number of}} hand brakes. Yves <b>Bourdon,</b> a member of MMA's Board of Directors, stated that the air brakes of all locomotives and freight cars had been activated, as well as hand brakes on 5 locomotives and 10 of the 72 freight cars. However, the TSB agrees with a July 6 statement to police by the train's engineer that he set hand brakes on just the five locomotive engines, a buffer car, and a car housing the remote control apparatus. The engineer also attempted a brake test but incorrectly left the locomotive air brakes on; this gave the false impression that the hand brakes alone would hold the train.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} locomotives did {{not show}} the pressure of steam in the boiler, but {{it was possible to}} estimate this by the position of the safety valve arm which often extended onto the firebox back plate; gradations marked on the spring column gave a rough indication of the actual pressure. The promoters of the Rainhill trials urged that each contender have a proper mechanism for reading the boiler pressure, and Stephenson devised a nine-foot vertical tube of mercury with a sight-glass at the top, mounted alongside the chimney, for his Rocket. The <b>Bourdon</b> tube gauge, in which the pressure straightens an oval-section coiled tube of brass or bronze connected to a pointer, was introduced in 1849 and quickly gained acceptance, and is still used today. Some locomotives have an additional pressure gauge in the steam chest. This helps the driver avoid wheel-slip at startup, by warning if the regulator opening is too great.|$|E
25|$|After {{the advent}} of {{unification}} and the electro-pneumatic action, builders of church organs started to see the advantages of these systems. As a result, several organ builders began adopting these concepts for use in their church organs. Among these were Austin, Möller, Aeolian-Skinner and Kimball, who used electro-pneumatic action in many of their organs. Today, approximately one fourth of all new or rebuilt church pipe organs use an electro-pneumatic action either exclusively, or as an augmentation to existing tracker actions. In the same vein, some amount of unification was utilized in some church organs, and even today many church pipe organs utilize some degree of unification in areas where it is not critical to the classical sound sought in such instruments, or in instruments where space for pipes is limited. With stops such as the 32' <b>bourdon</b> in the pedal division, or a 16' reed in a manual division, the basic theatre organ concept of extension is commonly—but discreetly—used by even the most noted organ builders.|$|E
500|$|At the Canucks' 2008–09 NHL season {{home opener}} against the Calgary Flames, the Canucks honoured <b>Bourdon</b> {{with a brief}} pre-game ceremony. Bourdon's family was {{presented}} with his last game-worn jersey, given by the fan who won the jersey during an annual charity event the previous season. Afterwards, Tom Cochrane and Red Rider performed [...] "Big League" [...] during the video tribute. Commemorative pins were handed out to fans attending the game and were worn throughout the season by General Motors Place hosts. The Canucks also wore [...] "LB" [...] on their helmets that season in memory of <b>Bourdon.</b> At General Motors Place, the Luc <b>Bourdon</b> Wall of Dreams was established to commemorate <b>Bourdon.</b>|$|E
500|$|Initially {{failing to}} make the Canucks {{starting}} roster out of training camp, <b>Bourdon</b> began the 2007–08 season with the Manitoba Moose; however, because {{of a series of}} injuries among the Canucks' defencemen throughout the season, <b>Bourdon</b> was called up on several occasions. <b>Bourdon</b> scored his first goal on November 16, 2007, against goaltender Niklas Bäckström in a 6–2 win over the Minnesota Wild. [...] <b>Bourdon</b> finished the season on the Canucks roster, and was sent back to the Manitoba Moose for the AHL playoffs, playing in six playoff games for the Moose. He appeared in 27 games for the Canucks over the season, scoring two goals, as well as scoring 14 points during 41 games with the Moose.|$|E
