5000|$|The College World Series (a {{baseball}} tournament) {{has frequently}} tried {{to modify the}} double-elimination format to set up, if possible, a single championship game. Until 1988, the College World Series did this by adding an extra round to the L <b>Bracket.</b> What would be the L <b>Bracket</b> major semifinals (i.e. the round where the W <b>Bracket</b> semifinal losers dropped down) became the L <b>Bracket</b> quarterfinals. The winners would then progress to the L <b>Bracket</b> semifinals against the two participants in the W <b>Bracket</b> final (i.e. the WINNERS of the W <b>Bracket</b> semifinals drop down). This thus left {{open the possibility that}} the W <b>Bracket</b> champion would pick up a loss, albeit in the L <b>Bracket</b> semifinal. If, however, the W <b>Bracket</b> champion prevailed in the L <b>Bracket</b> semifinal, the same two-game final setup existed in effect, albeit not in practice ... for under the CWS pre-1988 version, the unbeaten W <b>Bracket</b> champion would be playing a once-beaten L <b>Bracket</b> opponent in the L <b>Bracket</b> final, with the winner to advance to play the unbeaten W <b>Bracket</b> champion in the finals (if necessary). The CWS subsequently broke up its eight-team field into two four-team double elimination tournaments, with the winners meeting in either a sudden-death or, currently, a best-of-three final.|$|R
