40|$|Abstract. To attain {{interoperable}} <b>business</b> <b>service</b> collaborations, {{the nature}} and concepts of service-oriented inter-enterprise environments must be carefully analysed and formalized. Moreover, development tools and runtime infrastructure services are needed for establishing a sustainable <b>business</b> <b>service</b> ecosystem that provides interoperable <b>business</b> <b>service</b> delivery. The research proposal introduced in this paper addresses these issues by developing metamodels and methods for validating and maintaining <b>business</b> <b>service</b> interoperability {{in the context of}} inter-enterprise collaborations. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{uses the}} {{construct}} of the liability of newness to identify how entrepreneurs of new and young companies use <b>business</b> advisory <b>service</b> in the start-up process of their micro-companies. Design/methodology/approach: Various statistical techniques were used to analyze aA sample of 2832 new and young companies were analysed. The empirical data derive from a survey of micro-companies in Sweden and their use of 20 kinds of <b>business</b> advisory <b>services.</b>  Findings: Despite some similarities {{in the use of}} <b>business</b> <b>service</b> areas, the paper finds that new companies use more and different <b>business</b> advisory <b>service</b> areas than young companies. The paper examines these similarities and differences in detail. Practical implications: This research adds to our knowledge on how <b>business</b> <b>service</b> providers (public and private) can tailor their offerings to new and young companies. In particular, these findings may be of interest to government policy makers and other relevant stakeholders as they allocate funds to publicly funded organizations that provide <b>business</b> advisory <b>service.</b> Originality/value: The paper analyzes a broad range of <b>business</b> <b>service</b> areas used by new and young companies. This paper, which takes a user-perspective, contributes to the rather sparse research in this field because it examines <b>business</b> advisory <b>service</b> from the demand side rather than the supply side...|$|R
