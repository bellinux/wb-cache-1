30|$|Overall, the {{fabrication}} effects—including {{change in the}} value added coefficient, import coefficient, and intermediate input structure—had a minor effect <b>on</b> <b>exported</b> DVA. First, in 2002 – 2007, upgrading of industrial structure {{and an increase in}} labor cost led to an increase in the value added coefficient of industries. The effect of value added ratio <b>on</b> <b>exported</b> DVA was therefore positive, while in 2007 – 2010 this effect was negative. Second, as Chinese industries transformed, imports used in production decreased. More domestic products were used as substitutions and the import coefficient therefore decreased. This is reflected by the positive impact <b>on</b> <b>exports</b> of value added. Third and finally, during 2007 – 2010, increasing amounts of domestic raw materials and manufacture-related services were employed in export production. This can be viewed as an indicator of the increasing competitiveness of domestically produced goods. This had a positive effect <b>on</b> <b>exported</b> DVA. Change in the intermediate input structure therefore had a positive effect <b>on</b> <b>exported</b> DVA, contributing 1.9 % in 2007 – 2010.|$|R
40|$|Developing {{countries}} face a compliance {{gap with}} regard to trading rules at multilateral and bilateral negotiations and despite greater trade openness and the increasingly interdependence nature of global economy, these countries face internal constraints perpetuated by limited resources required {{to invest in the}} elements that would boost exports. This study examines the impact of Aid-for-Trade (AfT) <b>on</b> <b>export</b> performance of developing countries using panel data consisting of 131 countries from 2000 to 2013. In order to reveal the impact of AfT <b>on</b> <b>export</b> performance, the study uses regression analysis where the model specification includes variables such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), money supply, exchange rate, trade openness, transparency and corruption and regulatory environment which are important in trade and have been used in regressions to explore the impact of aid <b>on</b> <b>exports</b> of receiving countries. The study reveals surprising results of the impact of AfT <b>on</b> <b>export</b> performance. Empirical results demonstrate that the impact of AfT <b>on</b> <b>export</b> performance is insignificant despite having a positive coefficient...|$|R
