Despite knowledge of effective management practices including pest-resistant turf varieties, irrigation management, and microbial controls that contribute to an IPM approach, <b>billbug</b> management continues to rely heavily on prophylactic synthetic insecticides. This review will summarize the identification and biology of billbugs and strategies for their management. Turfgrass covers 3 ̆e 164, 000 km 2 (63, 321 mi 2) of the United States landscape, over three times the land area of any other irrigated crop (Milesi et al. 2005), and includes golf courses, home lawns, sports fields, and sod farms (Gelernter 2012). In 2005, the revenue generated by the turfgrass industry exceeded US 62 billion (Haydu et al. 2008), surpassing the combined value of corn (US 21 billion) and soybeans (US 17 billion) {{in the same year}} (NASS 2006). This revenue depends largely on maintenance of turfgrass quality, aspects of which include density, texture, growth habit, smoothness, and color (Beard 1972). Management practices that enhance turfgrass quality, like regular irrigation, fertilization, and mowing, however, encourage many species of turf-feeding arthropods (Held and Potter 2012). Turf is grown primarily for its utility and appearance, and discoloration of turfgrass can quickly become unacceptable in settings such as golf courses and sod farms, whose revenues depend largely on turf health and quality. Feeding by <b>billbug</b> (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Sphenophorus spp.) larvae in stems and on roots causes spotty patches of yellow and brown turf, which can expand to large areas of dead grass. Thus, billbugs can be a serious pest of turfgrass, but effective management has been historically difficult due to several aspects of <b>billbug</b> biology, which will be discussed in this review. Billbugs are {{a complex of}} weevils native to and widespread throughout the United States (Johnson-Cicalese et al. 1990, Shetlar et al. 2012). The genus Sphenophorus contains 71 species, 64 of which occur in North America (Niemczyk and Shetlar 2000). At least 10 species are pests of turfgrass in the United States, including the bluegrass <b>billbug</b> (Sphenophorus parvulus Gyllenhal) and hunting <b>billbug</b> (S. venatus vestitus Chittenden), which are considered most harmful to cool-season grasses and warm-season grasses, respectively (Potter and Braman 1991, Vittum et al. 1999). Though billbugs have been known to infest other agricultural crops such as corn (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and range grasses (Satterthwait 1931 a, Asay et al. 1983, Kuhn et al. 2013), they were first recognized as a serious pest of turfgrass when bluegrass <b>billbug</b> began to outbreak in several states in the 1960 s (Tashiro and Personius 1970). These outbreaks were thought to be caused by resistance of the bluegrass <b>billbug</b> to pesticides that were heavily used at the time and the resulting reduction in natural enemy populations (Tashiro and Personius 1970).

40|$|Billbugs (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea: Sphenophorus) {{are serious}} pests of managed turfgrass across North America. Damage {{symptoms}} are most visible during stressful periods {{of the growing}} season and are commonly confused with disease, drought, or nutrient deficiency. Billbugs are frequently a perennial problem and when misdiagnosed, damage often results in seriously degraded stands of turfgrass that are easily encroached by weeds. Presently, management of billbugs relies heavily on chemical insecticides. Even then, the nationwide assemblage of multiple sympatric <b>billbug</b> species and the cryptic nature of the damaging larval stage makes management of these insects challenging. A better understanding of <b>billbug</b> biology and behavior could improve the efficacy of insecticide inputs and {{provide a basis for}} the development of alternative, non-pesticide management techniques that are aligned with integrated pest management (IPM). This thesis focused on characterizing the <b>billbug</b> species composition in Indiana and clarifying the seasonal phenology of one particularly problematic species, S. venatus. To accomplish this, I examined the utility of molecular techniques to identify the otherwise cryptic larval stage of several sympatric, turf-inhabiting <b>billbug</b> species. I also explored the potential for S. venatus to use two forms of chemoreception: recognition of volatile organic compounds and cuticular wax components. ^ Weekly monitoring of pitfall traps revealed four sympatric <b>billbug</b> species in Indiana: S. venatus, S. parvulus, S. minimus, and S. inaequalis. Further investigation on the seasonal biology of S. venatus revealed two overlapping cohorts in Indiana and molecular confirmation of overwintering S. venatus larvae through examination of three genetic loci (CO 1, 18 S, and ITS 2). In y-tube olfactometer bioassays, S. venatus males were attracted to the combination of conspecifics and host-plants as well as host-plants alone. S. venatus females were attracted to the combination of male conspecifics and host plant material and male conspecifics alone. These findings suggest S. venatus males are predominantly influenced by host-plant volatiles while females likely respond to a male-produced volatile pheromone. Coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of S. venatus and S. parvulus whole-body cuticular extracts revealed a series of aliphatic hydrocarbons with qualitative and quantitative interspecific differences, as well as intraspecific quantitative differences between males and females. These differences in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles could serve as critical mate-recognition cues among sympatric Sphenophorus species, a hypothesis that remains to be tested. ^ By clarifying the seasonal phenology of S. venatus, results provide a foundation for improved insecticide selection and application timing in the Midwestern U. S. for this pest. Furthermore, findings demonstrate that a DNA-based larval identification tool could be useful for clarifying the seasonal phenology of sympatric <b>billbug</b> species with morphologically indistinguishable larval stages. Findings also support the idea that volatile and contact semiochemicals could potentially be used for the development of improved <b>billbug</b> monitoring techniques and sustainable mating disruption strategies. ...|$|E
40|$|Factors {{associated}} with feeding injury to grass plants by {{two species of}} adult billbugs, Sphenophorus gentilis and S. parvulus, were evaluated. Early season tests utilized adult bluegrass billbugs while later studies involved wildrye billbugs. Types of feeding injury were determined and preferred feeding locations on host plants were identified for each <b>billbug</b> species. Greenhouse and field studies compared different species of grasses, individual plants within a species, and plants from different locations, for <b>billbug</b> susceptibility. The effect of grass plant age and stem size were also tested using bluegrass billbugs. Using analysis of variance and multiple comparison tests, significant differences in amounts of feeding injury were determined among entries. Wildrye plants from different geographic locations showed large differences in susceptibility to wildrye <b>billbug</b> feeding when compared in a greenhouse study.

40|$|Advances in {{mass-production}} and formulation {{technology of}} entomopathogenic nematodes, {{the discovery of}} numerous isolates/strains and the desirability of reducing pesticide usage {{have resulted in a}} surge of scientific and commercial interest in these nematodes. The lessons learned from earlier problems have encouraged scientists and leading commercial companies to increase their efforts toward improving cost efficiency and better product positioning in the market within the confines of product capabilities. The successes or failures of the nematodes against 24 arthropod pest species of agriculture and animals and against a major slug pest in agriculture are discussed in this review. Commercial successes are documented in markets such as citrus (Diaprepes root weevil), greenhouses and glasshouses (black vine weevil, fungus gnats, thrips, and certain borers), turf (white grubs, <b>billbugs,</b> and mole crickets), and mushrooms (sciarid flies). In addition, the successful commercialization of a nematode (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) against slugs in agricultural systems is presented. Despite this progress, the reality is that nematode-based products have limited market share. Limited share is attributed to higher product cost compared to standard insecticides, low efficacy under unfavorable conditions, application timing and conditions, limited data and cost benefit in IPM programs, refrigeration requirements and limited room temperature shelf life (product quality), use of suboptimum nematode species, and lack of detail application directions. One or more of these factors affected the market introduction of the nematodes despite promising field efficacy against insects such as black cutworm in turf, sugar beet weevil in sugar beet, sweet potato weevil in sweet potato, and house fly adult in animal-rearing farms. Insects such as cabbage root maggots, carrot root weevil, and Colorado potato beetle are listed on the label of certain commercial products despite low efficacy data, due to insect susceptibility, biology, and/or behavior. To make entomopathogenic nematodes more successful, realistic strategies through genetic engineering, IPM programs, and new delivery systems and/or training programs to overcome their inherent cost, formulation instability, and limited field efficacy toward certain insects are neede...|$|R

40|$|Anatomical, morphological, and {{physiological}} characteristics of 12 Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) cultivars were studied and analyzed to: (1) determine criteria for selecting <b>billbug</b> resistant cultivars and (2) identify mechanisms of resistance. Injury rating exhibited a positive (r = 0. 52) correlation with shoot size, but a negative (r = 0. 53) correlation with shoot density. Larval density exhibited a negative (r = 0. 54) correlation with percent lignified leaf tissue, but a positive (r = 0. 74) correlation with shoot size. A negative correlation {{was found between}} total cell wall content of field grown plants harvested and larval density (r = 0. 88) or injury (r = 0. 70). Cellulose {{appeared to be the}} primary constituent responsible for this relationship. An Instron Universal Testing Instrument was used to measure the force required to shear and puncture individual shoots. A negative correlation (r = 0. 60) was found between shoot shear strength for spring harvested field grown plants and larval density. A positive correlation was noted between etiolated shoot weight and larval density (r = 0. 75) or injury rating (r = 0. 50). ^ Discriminant analysis was used as an allocation and separatory technique. Discriminant analysis was useful because overestimation of variable information content and dimensionality of data was reduced. Separatory discrimination suggested that highly and moderately resistant cultivars possessed tougher tissue but lower recuperative potential than susceptible or tolerant cultivars. Ability to conceal <b>billbug</b> injury appeared to distinguish tolerant and highly resistant cultivars from susceptible and moderately resistant cultivars, respectively. Development of a classification procedure appeared promising with correct prediction ranging from 67 to 98 % depending upon number and type of discriminating variables analyzed. Correct prediction was enhanced by increasing discriminating variable number or by jointly analyzing variables measured under different growing conditions. Most promising classification techniques involved analyses of variables associated with greenhouse (etiolated shoot weight, root regrowth, and etiolated shoot number) and field grown (shoot strength and size, epidermal short cell and prickle hair count, and total cell wall content) plants. More extensive tests are needed before definitive conclusions can be made. ...|$|E

Although damage patterns and trapping studies suggested that SCB dispersal into fields was primarily by walking, SCB are capable of strong flight. Weevils of both the overwintered and summer generations were caught in flight traps. Diurnal activity patterns of adult SCB were often bimodal; peak numbers of adults were found on plants and caught in pitfall traps in late morning and mid- to late afternoon.

40|$|Adult and larval damage {{potential}} of the southern corn <b>billbug</b> (SCB), Sphenophorus callosus (Olivier), was studied in small-plot enclosures and in commercial cornfields in eastern North Carolina from 1978 to 1980. In small-plot studies, corn at the two- and four-leaf stages showed damage by adult SCB at several insect densities, but more mature corn was not visibly damaged. Female SCB caused more damage than male SCB on three- to four-leaf stage corn. Damage by females tended to result in dead terminals, whereas feeding by males more often resulted in holes in the leaves. In small-plot studies, average plant height per plot was negatively correlated with average damage ratings per plot on three dates in 1980 on whorl stage corn. However, grain yield per plot at harvest {{was positively correlated with}} average damage ratings per plot on 9 - to lO-leaf stage corn. In commercial cornfields, larval SCB infestations were often associated with early death in corn plants. Of a total of 506 plants sampled at two sites in late July and early August 1980, 85. 2 % of plants dying early were infested with larval SCB, whereas nondying plants had 10. 0 % SCB infestations. This early death was associated with a 42. 4 % yield decrease in paired comparisons of adjacent dying and nondying plants.

40|$|Due to the {{potential}} impact of conventional chemical pesticides on human health and on the environment, governments worldwide are developing policies to reduce the use of these pesticides. Instruments like the EU directive 91 / 414 /EEC, have resulted in the withdrawal of many active ingredients from the market. Furthermore, the new EU directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the sustainable use of pesticides states that non-chemical methods should be given priority wherever possible. To improve the sustainability of agriculture and to avoid resistance development against the receding number of active ingredients remaining on the market, biological alternatives for conventional chemical pesticides are much sought after and even urgently needed. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) are one of those alternatives. They are used for the biological control of an increasing number of insect pests. These bio-insecticides are exceptionally safe for farmers, farm workers, for consumers and for the environment. However, they may have lower efficacy than conventional chemical pesticides. Nonetheless, EPN are equivalent to or even better than conventional chemical insecticides in controlling a number of commercially important pests (e. g., against black vine weevil, citrus root weevil, cranberry girdler, hunting <b>billbug</b> and western corn rootworm). Poor efficacy against other pests can be the result of inappropriate application methods, the use of poor quality products or suboptimal application conditions. This work focused on optimizing the application of EPN in field vegetables. The general aim of this work was to test and, where possible, to improve the control potential of EPN against three difficult to reach pests, described in detail in chapter 1, viz. : the leaf-bound cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) in cauliflower, the soil-bound cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) in cauliflower and the cryptic onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) in leek. Depending on the target pest, the experiments described in chapters 2 to 5 examined the effect of (1) adding adjuvants to the spray suspension, (2) altering the application rate of the EPN and (3) adapting the application technique and/or (4) the timing of the application(s). Chapter 2 focused on improving the formulation and application of EPN on leaves using laboratory tests with special attention to one specific pest: the cabbage moth. Suitable adjuvants for EPN spray applications were selected based on the absence of toxic or immobilizing effects on two EPN species: Steinernema feltiae and S. carpocapsae. The selected humectants and dispersants were further screened for their effects on the sedimentation of these EPN species in a tank suspension. Next, the effect of three suitable surfactants and a humectant and the effect of nozzle size on the deposition of S. carpocapsae on hydrophobic cauliflower leaves was investigated. Subsequently, a laboratory experiment verified whether brewer’s yeast extract can be used as an attractant for the cabbage moth larvae, and whether it improves the mortality caused by EPN to cabbage moth larvae. Finally, the effect of the most suitable surfactant and humectant, selected from the deposition test, on the longevity and on the infectivity of S. carpocapsae, is presented. These experiments have shown that all selected alcohol ethoxylates (Synperonic 91 / 5, Synperonic 91 / 6, Synperonic 10 / 6 and Atplus 245) and the selected alkylpolysaccharide (AL- 2575) immobilized both S. carpocapsae and S. feltiae when mixed in the spray suspension. Xanthan gum remains the best sedimentation-retarding agent. An ISO 02 standard flat fan nozzle can clog when spraying S. carpocapsae. An ISO 04 standard flat fan nozzle provides a higher relative deposition of different S. carpocapsae-adjuvant suspensions on cauliflower leaves than the bigger ISO 08 standard flat fan nozzle. Three spreading agents (Silwet L- 77, SB Plant Invigorator and Addit) roughly doubled the relative EPN deposition with both the ISO 04 and the ISO 08 nozzle when added to the EPN suspension. Addition of xanthan gum did not significantly increase deposition any further. Addition of yeast extract to a foliar spray containing S. carpocapsae significantly increased mortality of the cabbage moth and decreased the amount of leaf damage caused by these caterpillars. And finally, it was shown that adding Addit and xanthan gum to a spray suspension containing S. carpocapsae prolongs the survival of EPN on leaves, and that these adjuvants can cause mortality in larvae of Galleria mellonella. It was however deemed unlikely, and proven in a field test (chapter 3), that Addit and xanthan gum at the used concentrations, would {{have a significant effect on}} insect plagues in field conditions. The field experiments described in chapter 3 implemented the results of chapter 2 and aimed to optimize the control of cabbage moth with S. carpocapsae. A spray application tools test, was performed to select a spray application technique that leads to a maximum of spray coverage on specific parts of the cauliflower plant. The targeted spraying areas were: (1) the central part of the plant, where the cabbage moth larvae can cause direct economic damage to the cauliflower head, and (2) the underside of the leaves, where the young larvae hide during the day and feed during the night. The test showed that two spray boom configurations with vertical extensions in the crop covered the lower side of the outer leaves very well, while also securing statistically equal coverage of the underside of the centre leaves, when compared to all other configurations. Therefore, one of these configurations, a spray boom configuration with TeeJet TP 80 04 EVS nozzles mounted on the horizontal spray boom and TeeJet UB 85 04 nozzles mounted 38 cm long vertical extensions, was selected for the field trial with S. carpocapsae. An adjuvant trial, determined whether S. carpocapsae, applied in the field with this technique, could effectively reduce the cabbage moth numbers in a cauliflower crop and/or the damage to this crop. It also tested if these parameters could be further reduced by adding yeast extract and/or Addit and xanthan gum to the tank suspension. An application rate trial and an application technique trial, were set up (1) to test the effect of different application rates of EPN on cabbage moth control and (2) to confirm if the application technique selected in the spray application tools test was indeed better suited than a standard broadcast spray application, for controlling the cabbage moth. In the adjuvant trial, the numbers of damaged cabbage heads clearly demonstrate a protective effect of spraying with a suspension of S. carpocapsae, when combined with Addit and xanthan gum. It was noticeable that Bt applications outperformed all other treatments, although the difference was not always significant. Based on these results, EPN might provide an extra control option against the cabbage moth, if the efficacy of EPN treatments can be further enhanced. Similar to the adjuvant trial, the numbers of cabbage moth larvae were highly variable between individual plants in both the application rate trial and the application technique trial, making it difficult to distinguish statistical differences between the mean number of caterpillars per plant. However, leaf damage measurements and the number of infected plants proved to be much less variable and thus much more reliable than counting numbers of caterpillars for assessing control by S. carpocapsae and Bt treatments in both trials. Only the Bt applications with the adapted spray boom effectively stopped damage development caused by the cabbage moth. Furthermore, the plots that received Bt with the adapted spray boom were the only plots that contained significantly less infected plants than the control plots. The protection against sunlight on the underside of leaves, together with better placement of the Bt spray may explain the better control of the Bt applications with the adapted spray boom compared with the regular spray boom. This chapter shows that there is much room for improvement in the foliar application of EPN against cabbage moth. Control results were probably largely dependent on the temperature. More cold-tolerant species, strains or breeding products of EPN should be searched for, so that they can be used against the cabbage moth, before any conclusions can be drawn on the optimal application rate of the EPN. The deposition measurements in all trials suffered from high variability. This was most probably caused by the plant architecture of cauliflower: due to the overlap of leaves, some areas of the plant are difficult to spray. This variability is a major concern for biocontrol agents like Bt and EPN, since areas that are not sprayed, are not protected against the targeted pest. When a low temperature active EPN species/strain/breeding product, efficacious against the cabbage moth, becomes available, then EPN applications might be fitted into biological control schemes to prevent development of resistance of cabbage moth against Bt. This is of major importance, since cabbage moth already seems to possess some innate resistance against Bt products. Chapter 4 presents three field tests with applications of IJ of S. feltiae against cabbage root fly in cauliflower. These tests focused on finding an optimal application rate (200, 000 IJ/plant vs. 50, 000 IJ/plant), a suitable application technique (plant tray spraying vs. drench application) and a good timing of the application (application at planting vs. application one week after planting vs. application two weeks after planting, with or without one or two follow-up treatment(s)). The results demonstrated that a plant tray spray with S. feltiae is superior to a drench application in controlling cabbage root fly in cauliflower. Plant tray sprayings with S. feltiae can reduce the percentage of dead plants compared with the non-treated control. The lack of an application rate-effect relationship suggests that it might be possible to further reduce the applied rate of S. feltiae without causing a significant reduction in control. Numbers of cabbage maggots around the plant roots can be temporarily reduced by plant tray sprays with a rate of 200, 000 IJ S. feltiae per cauliflower plant. Mortality results of bait tests with wax moth larvae on soil samples taken from around the cauliflower plants, showed that IJ of S. feltiae, applied as a plant tray spray, take one to two weeks to spread into the soil around the roots of cauliflower. These bait tests also showed that the most effective period of IJ of S. feltiae in the soil is limited up to five weeks, which warrants a follow-up treatment. Further research should examine whether the application rate of IJ of S. feltiae in a plant tray spray can be lowered, while maintaining a good control, and whether a follow-up application of S. feltiae, applied three to five weeks after planting with a better suited technique (e. g., injection), would further improve control of cabbage root fly. Chapter 5 presents two field trials in leek set up to determine and, if possible, to improve the effect of spray applications with S. feltiae against onion thrips in leek. The first trial was carried out on an organic farm and focused on selecting a suitable spray application technique and on testing the effect of an attractant on thrips control. The second trial focused on incorporating spray applications of EPN in a conventional insecticide scheme, and on the effect of mixing the surfactant Addit in the spray suspension on the control of onion thrips. The results show that the selected commercial strain of S. feltiae was not effective against the foliar inhabiting life stages of onion thrips in leek. Mixing a thrips attractant in the spray suspension and spraying with adapted spray equipment (band application and row application) did not improve the efficacy. Compared with the traditional spray boom technique, the row application technique ensured a more even EPN deposition on both the upper side and underside of both old and new leek leaves. This technique offers good potential for improving the applications of fungicides and of contact insecticides in leek. The general discussion in chapter 6 links the obtained results, and suggests directions for future research. The described experimental work with EPN against the cabbage moth, cabbage root fly and onion thrips showed that significant control of the first two pests is certainly possible in outdoor vegetables, but it also showed that there’s still a long way to go before EPN will be applied commercially against these pests in outdoor vegetables. Efficient control of insect pests with EPN requires a perfect match between several factors: the EPN species/strain/breeding product, the pest, the crop, the application (in terms of technique, formulation and application rate) and the environmental conditions. Matching these factors requires the screening and breeding of much more EPN species/strains for different properties (e. g., pathogenicity, temperature tolerance, mobility, drought resistance). In the short term, research on EPN applications against greenhouse pests seems to be the most promising area of research in temperate climates. Only when the prices for EPN drop due to more widespread adoption and when new EPN species/strains/breeding products and application techniques become available, will outdoor applications of EPN become commercially viable. Because pest control with EPN is obviously not a one-size fits-all solution, farmers will need appropriate knowledge to obtain successful pest control with EPN. Moreover, the upcoming EU obligation for farmers to use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) methods to protect their crops will further increase the demand for knowledge on IPM methods. Governmental, NGO and corporate advisory networks will need to be strengthened in order to fulfil this demand and to keep European crops healthy...|$|E
