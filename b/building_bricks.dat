The north and south faces are clear glass, while the other two sides are brick. The exterior walls taper slightly outward on the brick sides of the <b>building.</b> <b>Bricks</b> on these sides were laid horizontally, while the overhanging roof line contains bricks that were laid vertically. A glass-enclosed stairwell and the main entrance near the northwest corner are the only parts that jut out from the primarily rectangular building.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>building</b> <b>bricks</b> were {{moderately}} received but {{had some}} problems from a technical standpoint: their [...] "locking" [...] ability was limited, {{and they were not}} versatile. In 1958 the bricks were improved with hollow tubes in the underside of the brick. This added support in the base, enabling much better locking ability and improved versatility. The company patented the new design, as well as several similar designs to avoid competition. Ole Kirk Christiansen died that same year, and Godtfred inherited leadership of the company.|$|E
2500|$|Plastic {{products}} were not well received by customers initially, who preferred wooden or metal toys. Many of Lego's shipments were returned, following poor sales. In 1954, Godtfred {{had become the}} junior {{managing director of the}} Lego Group. Godtfred's conversation with an overseas buyer struck the idea of a toy [...] "system", with many toys in a line of related products. Godtfred evaluated their available products, and saw the plastic bricks as the best candidate for such a [...] "system". In 1955, Lego released the [...] "Town Plan" [...] as such a system, using the <b>building</b> <b>bricks.</b>|$|E
