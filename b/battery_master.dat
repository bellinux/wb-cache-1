Aprotic solvents cannot provide the H-bonds necessary to their dissolution, and simple practical solutions have yet to materialize. Here we disclose a novel and large family of boron esters of general formula Y-C((CH 2 O) (Z 1 O) (Z 2 O)) B whose Lewis acidity stems from geometrical constraint and can be tuned via electron affinity either by Y = CH 3 → Y = NO 2 or Z 1, 2) CH 2 → Z 1, 2) CO so as to partially or fully dissolve the above compounds both in battery solvent EC/DMC and in DMF.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{performance}} of E-limited scheduling in Bluetooth piconets under bursty traffic for infinite and finite buffer cases. We show that E-limited service outperforms exhaustive service in terms of end-to-end delay and that the delays may be minimized through the proper choice of a single variable parameter: the number of packets to be exchanged during a single visit to a slave. Using analytical results for access delay and end-to-end delay, as well as suitable approximations thereof, we propose three novel admission algorithms. The simplest Algorithm is based on queue stability, which makes it suitable for <b>battery</b> power-limited <b>masters.</b> The second algorithm estimates the access delay of the slave upon admission using the estimated first and second moments of the vacation times and makes the admission decision {{on the basis of}} predefined access delay bounds.

50|$|In the United States Marine Corps, first {{sergeant}} (abbreviated 1stSgt) is one rank above gunnery sergeant and one {{pay grade}} below sergeant major and master gunnery sergeant. It is equal in grade to master sergeant (E8), {{although the two}} ranks have different responsibilities. A first sergeant has command leadership responsibilities and serves as the senior enlisted adviser to the commander at the company, battery or detachment level, while master sergeants have technical responsibilities within their respective occupational fields, and serve important leadership roles within various company or <b>battery</b> sections. <b>Master</b> sergeants may also perform staff functions at the battalion/squadron level or above. Unlike first sergeants and master sergeants in the U.S. Army, no lateral movement is possible between the two ranks in the Marine Corps; they're permanent appointments and require a change in occupational specialty. Rather, gunnery sergeants elect a preference on their fitness reports, which are considered before promotion. Ultimately, those selected for either rank are appointed based on suitability, previous duty assignments, {{and the needs of}} the Marine Corps. Later in their careers, first sergeants are eligible to be considered for promotion to sergeant major, while master sergeants would be on the career track for master gunnery sergeant.|$|R

50|$|On 5 March Eclair sighted a {{schooner}} sailing towards La Hayes, Guadeloupe, {{where she}} could shelter under the guns of the <b>battery</b> there. Eclairs <b>master,</b> Mr John Salmon, and the surgeon, Mr John B. Douglas, and 10 men volunteered to take a boat and form a boarding party. As their boat entered the harbour both the vessel and the battery opened fire on them. Still, they managed to board and capture the schooner in ten minutes. In capturing her they killed five of her crew of 50 and wounded ten, while suffering no casualties of their own. The wounded included the captain and four men that jumped overboard. The battery continued to fire on the boarding party as they towed and rowed out their prize using sweeps.

25|$|Initially, H Battery was {{accommodated}} {{in tents}} near a small freshwater stream emptying into Sunny Bay, about 500 yards {{south of the}} gun emplacements, while camp buildings were erected there by the local Civil Construction Corps. Constructed mostly of timber from Johnson's sawmill at Stratford, {{on the outskirts of}} Cairns, these buildings were of a standard rectangular design measuring 60 feet by 20 feet. They included: 7 barrack rooms, officers' quarters, sergeants' quarters (each of these having separate ablution blocks and latrines), <b>battery</b> office, quarter <b>master's</b> store, officers' mess and kitchen, gunners' mess and kitchen, canteen and recreation room, and a small battery charging room to supply the camp with electricity. About 150 yards north of the camp a workshop was erected, and north of this, about half-way between the camp and the defence installations, a hospital and RAP shelter were built. There was no road from Cairns to the camp, which had to be supplied via boat (the unit had its own two-masted vessel, the Eulalie). A timber jetty was constructed at Sunny Bay near the camp site, and closer to the Cape a stone and concrete ramp for a landing barge.|$|R
40|$|A {{lighting}} system originally developed for NASA's Apollo and Skylab manned spacecraft {{resulted in a}} industrial spinoff and creation of a whole new company to produce and market the product line. The company is UDEC Corp., Waltham, Mass. UDEC's "Multi-Mode" electronic {{lighting system}}s are designed for plant emergency and supplemental use, such as night lighting, "always-on" stairwell lights and illuminated exit signs. Their advantages stem from the qualities demanded for spacecraft installation: extremely high fight output with very low energy drain, compactness, light weight, and high reliability. The Multi-Mode system includes long-life fluorescent lamps operated by electronic circuitry, a sealed battery that needs no maintenance for 10 years, and a solid-state battery charger. A typical emergency installation consists of a <b>master</b> module with <b>battery</b> and an eight watt lamp, together with four remote "Satellight" modules powered by the <b>master's</b> <b>battery.</b> As a night lighting system for maintenance or I security, UDEC fixtures can bypass the battery and 1 operate on normal current {{at a fraction of}} the energy 1 demand of conventional night lighting.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{continue}} their contribution to the profession of psychology in South Africa the selection committees of psychology departments of higher education institutions {{are faced with the}} difficult task of selecting the most suitable candidates to fill their Clinical, Counselling, Educational and Industrial Psychology masters coursework programmes. Selection committees have traditionally made use of several admission criteria and procedures ranging from academic performance to personality assessment to a combination of methods. Admission criteria vary greatly across Higher Education Institutions. The selection committee at the selected participating institution of higher education takes into account the prospective students' academic performance, relevant work or practical experience, research experience, active participation in the classroom, active involvement outside of the classroom (participation in and engagement with community activities), and personality. Currently the institution of higher education that provided the sample for the current study employs the NEO PI-R as well as the MMPI- 2 to assess masters applicants’ personality traits. A study by Britz (1994) recommended that the MBTI® be included in the assessment <b>battery</b> for psychology <b>masters</b> students. The primary aim of the proposed study is to identify, explore and describe the personality preferences of a group of prospective psychology masters applicants and a group of successfully selected psychology masters students at a South African Higher Education Institution utilising the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI®). The study was exploratory descriptive in nature and was based on the quantitative research approach. Non-probability convenience sampling and the survey method was utilised to identify and approach prospective participants. Participants were requested to complete the MBTI® questionnaire. The MBTI® protocols were hand-scored and the findings analysed utilising frequency distributions and inferential statistics, that is, means and standard deviations. The MBTI® was found to be valid and reliable in a variety of populations and contexts. xi Results indicated that the ISTJ (15 percent), INTP (15 percent) and ESFJ (15 percent) personality types were the three most common personality types amongst participants from the group of prospective psychology masters applicants. The ENFP (13 percent), INTP (13 percent) and ISFJ (13 percent) personality types were the three most common personality types amongst participants from the group of successfully selected masters students. The majority (14 percent) of participants from the total sample displayed a preference for the INTP personality type.
