The needles can number {{from one to}} seven per fascicle, but generally number from two to five. Each fascicle is produced from a small bud on a dwarf shoot in the axil of a scale leaf. These <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> often remain on the fascicle as a basal sheath. The needles persist for 1.5–40 years, depending on species. If a shoot is damaged (e.g. eaten by an animal), the needle fascicles just below the damage will generate a bud which can then replace the lost leaves.|$|E

Observation during flower and fruit organ development was done in eleven inflorescences. Quantitative and descriptive data were collected during one season of flowering time. Phenology of flower and fruit development could be classified in five stages, namely F 0 (flower initiation), F 1 (small <b>bud</b> <b>scale),</b> F 2 (large <b>bud</b> <b>scale),</b> F 3 (anthesis, flower opening) and F 4 (fruit development). All these events had average completing time in 112 days, and could be detailed as follows: flower initiation stage (F 0) took place in 20 days, small <b>scale</b> <b>bud</b> stage (F 1) occurred in 27 days, and large <b>scale</b> <b>bud</b> and anthesis stage (F 0 and F 3) each took place in 5 days, meanwhile fruit development stage (F 4 =S 0) would complete in 53 days.

40|$|Spruce <b>bud</b> <b>scale</b> (Physokermes piceae Schrnk.) affects {{tree growth}} {{directly}} and indirectly. Direct injury {{appears in the}} form of tissue damage, as insects suck sap from tree phloem. Indirect injury appears as “honeydew”, which results in negative effects on tree growth. Plant sap is saturated with various carbohydrates called photosynthates that are difficult for scaly insects to digest. Therefore it is secreted in excrements, which are subsequently a food source for the black sooty mold (Apiosporium pinophilum Fuckel). The fungus covers needles blocking stomata, causing decreased transpiration and photosynthesis. An inexplicable wither of Norway spruce was reported in Latvia during 2010 due to black sooty mold. However, spruce <b>bud</b> <b>scale</b> was not evident. In 2011, mass propagation of spruce <b>bud</b> <b>scale</b> was observed following the 2010 Norway spruce loss. One objective of this research was to determine if Kraft tree growth classes could be applied to establish the factors responsible for tree foliage damage. Six 21 - 40 year old (second age class) Norway spruce stands were evaluated. Two circular sample plots with a 7. 98 m radius, and a 200 -m 2 area were randomly established per each forest stand hectare. Diameter at breast height (dbh, 1. 3 m), and height of approximately 30 trees was measured to model a trend. For all trees, Kraft class, and foliage damage level caused by spruce <b>bud</b> <b>scale</b> and black sooty mold were determined. Significant differences were not observed in tree damage levels among stands, however significant differences among damage levels in different Kraft classes were detected (F = 3. 45 > Fcrit. = 2. 80, α = 0. 05 > P = 0. 02) found. Overall damage intensity was 29. 3 %. Total forestry loss was 1153 LVL (1640 EUR) for all surveyed stands (10 ha), and 115 LVL (164 EUR) per hectare...|$|R

2500|$|Sugarcane smut is disseminated via teliospores {{that are}} {{produced}} in the smut whip. These teliospores located either in the soil or on the plant, germinate {{in the presence of}} water. [...] After germination they produce promycelium and undergo meiosis to create four haploid sporidia. Sugarcane smut is bipolar and therefore produces two different mating types of sporida. [...] For infection to occur, two sporida from different mating types must come together and form a dikaryon. [...] This dikaryon then produces hyphae that penetrate the <b>bud</b> <b>scales</b> of the sugarcane [...] plant and infect the meristematic tissue. [...] The fungus grows within the meristematic tissue and induces formation of flowering structures which it colonises to produce its teliopores. The flowering structures, usually typical grass arrows, are transformed into a whip like sorus that grows out between the leaf sheaths. At first it is covered by a thin silvery peridium (this is the host tissue) which easily peels back when desiccated to expose the sooty black-brown teliospores. [...] These teliospores are then dispersed via wind and the cycle continues. The spores are reddish brown, round and subovoid and may be smooth to moderately echinulate. The size varies from 6.5 to 8um. Sugarcane cultivars intended for distribution to other geographical areas should be tested for susceptibility to S. scitamineum populations in each area.|$|E

Therefore, Ph. piceae is a significant spruce pest. Spruce scales attract many entomophagous insects able to reduce pest population. Parasitoid wasps Coccophagus lycimnia (Walk) (Aphelinidae) and Microterys lunatus (Dalm.) (Encyrtidae) were reared. Predators Exochomus quadripustulatus L., Scymnus abietis Paykull (Coccinellidae) and Anthribus nebulosus Forster (Anthribidae) were determined. Both species of ladybird were confirmed as predators of Ph. piceae {{for the first time}} in Serbia, while S. abietis is a new species for the fauna of Serbia.

The proposed method incorporates these features by using an hierarchical implicit modeling system, which provides a variety of tools for combining surface components in both smooth and non smooth configurations. A procedural interface to this system supports the use of inverse modeling, which is a global-to-local methodology, where the local properties of plant organs are described in terms of their global position within the tree architecture. Inverse modeling is used to define both the tree structure at any time, and a continuous developmental sequence for the tree from a seedling. These techniques provide an intuitive paradigm for the definition of complex tree growth sequences and their subsequent visualization, based solely on observed phenomena. Thus, a key advantage is that they do not require any knowledge of, or simulation of, the underlying biological processes...|$|R
