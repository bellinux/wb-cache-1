For small applied voltages, these effects lead to well known linear electrokinetic phenomena. In this paper, we predict some surprising nonlinear dynamics that can result from the competition between bulk and interfacial transport at higher voltages. When counterions are selectively removed by a membrane or electrode, a “deionization shock” can propagate through the microstructure, leaving in its wake an ultrapure solution, nearly devoid of coions and colloidal impurities. We elucidate the basic physics of deionization shocks and develop a mathematical theory of their existence, structure, and stability, allowing for slow variations in surface charge or channel geometry. Via asymptotic approximations and similarity solutions, we show that deionization shocks accelerate and sharpen in narrowing channels, while they decelerate and weaken, and sometimes disappear, in widening channels. These phenomena may find applications in separations (deionization, decontamination, biological assays) and energy storage (batteries, supercapacitors) involving electrolytes in microstructures.

Voltammetry clearly reveals current peaks related to lithium intercalation and deintercalation in the whole pH range investigated. Electrolyte pH plays {{a very important role}} in the performance of V 02 (B) electrodes. When pH is higher than about 10, the capacity involved in the lithium intercalation in V 02 (B) electrodes shows a rapid decline with repetitive cycling, which is suggested {{to be the result of}} the dissolution of the V 02 (B) electrodes into the <b>bulk</b> <b>electrolytes.</b> Decreasing the pH tends to reduce the dissolution of V 05 (B) and thereby gives better cycling behavior of V 02 (B) elec-trodes.

40|$|The ion concentration, {{electrical}} potential and current distributions of a membrane/electrolyte system under equilibrium conditions are investigated numerically. The membrane is modeled as {{an array of}} finite-length charged pores with uniform distributed surface charge density and in contact with single- or multi-component electrolytes in {{both sides of the}} membrane. The numerical model is verified using the theoretical results from Donnan, Nernst and the surface potentials. For cases involving equal electrolyte bulk concentrations in both sides of the membrane, it is found that the dimensionless Debye length and surface charge density characterize the ion concentration and potential distributions in the system. The {{electrical potential}} difference between the membrane and external <b>bulk</b> <b>electrolyte</b> depends on the degree of increase in counter-ion concentration inside the pore relative to the <b>bulk</b> <b>electrolyte.</b> Higher potential difference can be resulted as the dimensionless Debye length decreases or the surface charge density increases. In a membrane/multi-component system, the resulting potential difference between the membrane and external <b>bulk</b> <b>electrolyte</b> is smaller as compared with the membrane/single-component electrolyte system due to the increase in dimensionless Debye length. For systems with unequal electrolyte bulk concentrations in contact with the membrane, current flow appears in the system due to the establishment of concentration and potential gradients in the system.

40|$|Similarities in the {{inhibition}} of crevice corrosion and pitting {{can be explained}} {{on the basis of}} competitive adsorption between inhibitive and aggressive ions. A mathematical model has been developed which takes into account competitive adsorption between aggressive ions (C 1) and inhibitive ions (CrO 4 =), with each ion adsorbing according to a Temkin iso-therm. In the case of crevice corrosion of iron, this model explains the linear relationship which has been observed be-tween the logarithm of the chloride ion activity and the logarithm of the minimum chromate activity required for protec-tion against crevice corrosion. In the case of pitting, this same model describes the linear decrease in pitting potential with the logarithm of the C 1 - activity at constant CrO 4 = concentration. The mathematical model, in conjunction with electro-chemical data and adsorption isotherms, allows calculation of a critical ratio, Ocrit, of surface coverages of aggressive to in-hibitive ion necessary to initiate localized corrosion. This critical ratio was computed to be approximately the same value (1. 9) for the crevice corrosion and pitting of iron in chromate/chloride solutions. Nominal confirmation for this computed value of Ocrit was provided by surface analyses using XPS.

The modified heptamer is stable and can be purified by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, without dissociation of the subunits. The properties of the modified pore were studied by single channel current recording. The PEG molecule reduces the mean conductance of the pore by 18 %, as would be predicted {{from the effects of}} PEG on the conductivity of <b>bulk</b> <b>electrolytes.</b> The recordings also reveal a variety of low amplitude current fluctuations on a time scale of seconds, which are tentatively ascribed to the reorganization of the PEG molecule within the channel lumen and associated movements of the polypeptide chain. Another class of events, comprising uniform high-amplitude negative fluctuations in current with durations of milliseconds, is ascribed to motions of the PEG molecule into one of the channel entrances, thereby producing more extensive channel block. When instead a 3000 Da PEG is attached within the channel lumen, the single channel properties are changed in keeping with the lower mass of the polymer. For example, the high-amplitude fluctuations occur more frequently and are of shorter duration suggesting that the 3000 Da PEG is more mobile than the 5000 Da chain. With further development, the approach taken here should be useful for the indirect monitoring of polymer dynamics at the single molecule level.

In the current work we use the generalized Frumkin-Butler-Volmer (gFBV) equation to describe electrochemical reactions, an equation which, contrary to the classical Butler–Volmer approach, includes {{the effect of the}} double layer composition on the charge transfer rate. The gFBV theory is transparently coupled to the Poisson–Nernst–Planck ion transport theory to describe mass transfer in an electrochemical cell that consists of two parallel plate electrodes which sandwich a monovalent electrolyte.

40|$|Diffusioosmotic {{flows of}} {{electrolyte}} solutions in slit nanochannels with homogeneous surface charges induced by electrolyte concentration gradients {{in the absence}} of externally applied pressure gradients and potential differences are investigated theoretically. A continuum mathematical model consisting of the strongly coupled Nernst–Planck equations for the ionic species 2 ̆ 7 concentrations, the Poisson equation for the electric potential in the electrolyte solution, and the Navier–Stokes equations for the flow field is numerically solved simultaneously. The induced diffusioosmotic flow through the nanochannel is computed as functions of the externally imposed concentration gradient, the concentration of the electrolyte solution, and the surface charge density along the walls of the nanochannel. With the externally applied electrolyte concentration gradient, a strongly spatially dependent electric field and pressure gradient are induced within the nanochannel that, in turn, generate a spatially dependent diffusioosmotic flow. The diffusioosmotic flow is opposite to the applied concentration gradient for a relatively low <b>bulk</b> <b>electrolyte</b> concentration. However, the electrolyte solution flows {{from one end of the}} nanochannel with a higher electrolyte concentration to the other end with a lower electrolyte concentration when the <b>bulk</b> <b>electrolyte</b> concentration is relatively high.

40|$|Electric double layers are ubiquitous, arising in {{some form}} in almost every {{situation}} involving an interface with an aqueous electrolyte solution. In order to gain insight into the behavior of electrolytes and electric double layers, simple models of <b>bulk</b> and inhomogeneous <b>electrolyte</b> solutions are considered in this thesis. As the main focus is on situations where mean field theory is not applicable, due to high concentration, strong electrostatic interactions, polarization of the interface {{or a combination of}} these, the spatial correlation between ions is explicitly considered. This is done within the framework of integral equation theory. The hypernetted chain (HNC) approximation is employed, which may be regarded as an approximate expression for the relation between the correlation functions and the potential of mean force. The excess contribution to the chemical potential is readily obtainable in the HNC approximation. By exploiting the fact that the ideal contribution to the chemical potential only depends on the local concentration and that thermodynamic equilibrium requires that the total chemical potential is equal everywhere, the concentration profile for each species of ion can be determined. Thus, the HNC approximation gives rise to a theory for electric double layers as well as for <b>bulk</b> <b>electrolytes.</b> The model of ions and interfaces {{is based on the assumption}} that the ions are hard, charged spheres that are embedded in a dielectric continuum that represents the solvent. This type of model obviously ignores any effect of the atomic granularity of the solvent, but takes into account both electrostatic and excluded volume effects that together give rise to several interesting and counterintuitive phenomena. These have implications for both single interface properties and interface-interface interactions. Any contrast in dielectric properties on each side of the interface gives rise to forces on the ions in the vicinity, which may also be of importance for the behavior of the system. Dispersion interactions between ions and interfaces are present whenever the ions have a non-zero polarizability. Each ionic charge in the vicinity of an interface also causes polarization, creating a charge distribution that gives rise to forces on all ions in the vicinity. Thus, such polarization modifies the forces amongst ions as well as those between ions and interfaces. Both dispersion forces and the polarization of interfaces are explicitly considered in this thesis...|$|R

We show in this work how Chebyshev polynomial filtered subspace iteration (CheFSI) can be used to address this issue and push the envelope in large-scale materials simulations in a discontinuous Galerkin framework. We describe how the subspace filtering steps can be performed in an efficient and scalable manner using a two-dimensional parallelization scheme, thanks to the orthogonality of the DG basis set and block-sparse structure of the DG Hamiltonian matrix.

30|$|This {{extremely}} high length uniformity in a disordered AAO template is mainly {{attributed to the}} slow nanowire growth rate {{which is achieved by}} reducing the ion transport rate at low temperature. The slow ion diffusion may inhibit two major ion transport regions that can lead to the nonuniform nanowire growth: First is the transport of cations from the <b>bulk</b> <b>electrolyte</b> to the pore entrance. At room temperature, without any forced convection, cations entering the pores tend to be concentrated at the edge area of the template since the excess cations are constantly diffused from the adjacent <b>bulk</b> <b>electrolyte</b> due to the hemispherical diffusion layers formed at the edge area [17]. Second is the cation transport along the pore channels. Different pore diameters and native defects inside the pores can lead to nonuniform ion transport [15, 17], resulting nonuniform nanowire growth. These two unfavorable transport behaviors are believed to be significantly hindered even without any stirring or pulsed electrodeposition when the deposition temperature is sufficiently lowered, thereby achieving {{extremely high}} length uniformity.|$|E
