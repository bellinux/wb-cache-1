5|$|Kikuyu girls {{cut each}} other's vulvas in the 1950s {{as a symbol}} of defiance, {{in the context of the}} {{campaign}} against female genital mutilation in colonial Kenya. The movement came to be known as Ngaitana ("I will circumcise myself"), because to avoid naming their friends the girls said they had cut themselves. Historian Lynn Thomas described the episode as significant in the history of FGM <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> clear that its victims were also its perpetrators.|$|E

25|$|Wilhelm Schickard, a German polymath, {{designed}} a calculating machine in 1623 which combined a mechanised form of Napier's rods with the world's first mechanical adding machine {{built into the}} base. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> use of a single-tooth gear there were circumstances in which its carry mechanism would jam. A fire destroyed {{at least one of}} the machines in 1624 and it is believed Schickard was too disheartened to build another.|$|E
25|$|For anti-torpedo-boat defense, the Lord Nelsons {{retained}} {{a battery of}} 12-pounders. These were mounted on a large flying deck amidships, where {{they had a good}} field of fire. However, this innovative mounting scheme also was criticised <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> a good target and because in combat falling debris due to damage might foul the 9.2-inch turrets below. In addition, some officers believed that the all-12-pounder battery was too light to deal with larger, modern torpedo boats.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1963, Memphis {{adopted a}} mayor-council form of government, with 13 City Council members, six elected at-large from {{throughout}} the city and seven elected from geographic districts. Following passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, civil rights activists challenged the at-large is electoral system in court <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> {{it more difficult for}} the minority to elect candidates of their choice; at-large voting favored candidates who could command a majority across the city. In 1995, the city adopted a new plan. The 13 Council positions are elected from nine geographic districts: seven are single-member districts and two elect three members each.|$|E

25|$|The {{drinking}} straw is a tube used for transferring a liquid to the mouth, usually {{a drink from}} one location to another. The first crude forms of {{drinking straw}}s were made of dry, hollow, rye grass. Marvin Stone is {{the inventor of the}} drinking straw. Stone, who worked in a factory that made paper cigarette holders, did not like this design <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> beverages taste like grass. As an alternative, on January 3, 1888, Stone got a piece of paper from his factory and wrapped it around a pencil. By coating it with wax, his drinking straw became leak-proof so that it would not get waterlogged.|$|E
25|$|The repeal {{movement}} was initiated and {{financed by the}} Association Against the Prohibition Amendment, who worked to elect Congressmen who agreed to support repeal. The group's wealthy supporters included John D. Rockefeller, Jr., S. S. Kresge, and the Du Pont family, among others, who had abandoned the dry cause. Pauline Sabin, a wealthy Republican who founded the Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform (WONPR), argued that Prohibition should be repealed <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> the United States a nation of hypocrites and undermined its respect {{for the rule of}} law. This hypocrisy and the fact that women had initially led the prohibition movement convinced Sabin to establish the WONPR. Their efforts eventually led to the repeal of prohibition.|$|E
25|$|Einstein was {{the first}} {{physicist}} to say that Planck's discovery of the quantum (h) would require a rewriting {{of the laws of}} physics. To support his point, in 1905 he proposed that light sometimes acts as a particle which he called a light quantum (see photon and wave–particle duality). Bohr {{was one of the most}} vocal opponents of the photon idea and did not openly embrace it until 1925. The photon appealed to Einstein because he saw it as a physical reality (although a confusing one) behind the numbers. Bohr disliked it <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> the choice of mathematical solution arbitrary. He did not like a scientist's having to choose between equations.|$|E

25|$|The Boxer Uprising {{was in part}} a {{reaction}} against Christianity in China. Christianity was prevalent among bandits in Shandong. In 1895, the Manchu Yuxian, a magistrate in the province, acquired {{the help of the}} Big Swords Society in fighting against Bandits. The Big Swords practiced heterodox practices, however, they were not bandits and were not seen as bandits by Chinese authorities. The Big Swords relentlessly crushed the bandits, but the bandits converted to the Catholic Church, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> them legally immune to prosecution under the protection of the foreigners. The Big Swords proceeded to attack the bandit Catholic churches and burn them. Yuxian only executed several Big Sword leaders, but did not punish anyone else. More secret societies started emerging after this.|$|E
25|$|Through {{most of the}} Victorian era until {{towards the}} end, the lapels were cut {{separately}} and sewn on later, apparently <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> the lapel roll more elegantly. The revers {{from the inside of}} the coat wrapped over to the front, creating a small triangle of silk, while the outer half was cut from two strips of the body fabric. This was a feature of double-breasted frock coats used on all such coats, but morning and dress coats, which had previously followed this practice, began to be made with attached lapels (wholecut) around the end of the Edwardian era. Through the Victorian era, a row of decorative button holes was created down the lapel edge, but by Edwardian period these were reduced down to just the one lapel boutonnière button hole.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, authors such as Rodney Needham and Edmund Leach {{were highly}} {{influenced}} by structuralism. Authors such as Maurice Godelier and Emmanuel Terray combined Marxism with structural anthropology in France. In the United States, authors such as Marshall Sahlins and James Boon built on structuralism {{to provide their}} own analysis of human society. Structural anthropology fell out of favour in the early 1980s {{for a number of}} reasons. D'Andrade suggests that this was <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> unverifiable assumptions about the universal structures of the human mind. Authors such as Eric Wolf argued that political economy and colonialism should be at the forefront of anthropology. More generally, criticisms of structuralism by Pierre Bourdieu led to a concern with how cultural and social structures were changed by human agency and practice, a trend which Sherry Ortner has referred to as 'practice theory'.|$|E

The album features music recorded for the Australian motion picture The Boys (1998). The All About Jazz review states that [...] "The album {{would make a}} good start {{for those who want to}} get into these Australians' music, <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> <b>made</b> of smaller doses of the trio's traditional work." ...|$|R

25|$|In his memoirs, Pershing {{claimed that}} the American {{breakout}} from the Argonne {{at the start of}} November was the decisive event leading to the German acceptance of an armistice, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> untenable the Antwerp–Meuse line. This is probably an exaggeration; the outbreak of civil unrest and naval mutiny in Germany, the collapse of Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire, and particularly Austria-Hungary following Allied victories in Salonika, Syria, and Italy, and the Allied victories on the Western Front were among a series of events in the autumn of 1918 which made it clear that Allied victory was inevitable, and diplomatic inquiries about an armistice had been going on throughout October. President Wilson was keen to tie matters up before the mid-term elections, and as the other Allies were running low on supplies and manpower, they followed Wilson's lead.|$|E
25|$|Author and {{reporter}} Richard M. Levine {{later wrote}} that compared to Marlene Olive, Riley did not harbor much anger at Naomi Olive, whom he barely knew, and therefore Riley {{would be less}} likely to use a method of homicide suggesting rage; that Riley would have used his loaded gun as the weapon rather than a hammer; and that Marlene Olive had previously asked Riley how hard she would have to hit Naomi Olive in order to kill her. However, others have noted that Marlene had no blood on her clothing when she left the house and would not have had time to change clothes; that Riley used a hammer to avoid alerting neighbors <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> less noise than a gunshot; and that according to a hypnosis expert, Riley's revised confession lacked credibility. Marlene Olive continued to maintain that Riley had beaten and killed her mother in addition to shooting her father, and denied that she herself had any part in the killing of either parent.|$|E
25|$|The {{committee}} then submitted {{an updated}} version of the designation amendment to the House on October 23 that changed the number of candidates in a contingency election from five to three and allowed the Senate to choose the Vice President if there were a tie in that race. Small Federalist states disliked the change from five to three, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> it far less likely that a small-state candidate would make it to a contingency election. Huger and New York Federalist Gaylord Griswold argued that the Constitution was a compromise between large and small states and the method chosen by the Framers is supposed to check the influence of the larger states. Huger even asserted that the Constitution itself was not a union of people, but a union of large and small states in order to justify the original framework for electing the President. Designation, argued Griswold and Huger, would violate the spirit of the Constitution by taking away a check on the power of the large states.|$|E

25|$|Albania {{entered an}} {{orbit around the}} Soviet Union, and in September 1948 Moscow stepped in to {{compensate}} for Albania's loss of Yugoslav aid. The shift {{proved to be a}} boon for Albania because Moscow had far more to offer than hard-strapped Belgrade. The fact that the Soviet Union had no common border with Albania also appealed to the Albanian regime <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> it more difficult for Moscow to exert pressure on Tirana. In November at the First Party Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor (APL), the former Albanian Communist Party renamed at Stalin's suggestion, Hoxha pinned the blame for the country's woes on Yugoslavia and Xoxe. Hoxha had Xoxe sacked as internal affairs minister in October, replacing him with Shehu. After a secret trial in May 1949, Xoxe was executed. The subsequent anti-Titoist purges in Albania brought the liquidation of 14 members of the party's 31 person Central Committee and 32 of the 109 People's Assembly deputies. Overall, the party expelled about 25% of its membership. Yugoslavia responded with a propaganda counterattack, canceled its treaty of friendship with Albania, and in 1950 withdrew its diplomatic mission from Tirana.|$|E
