5|$|Amphibians use {{the ephemeral}} natural pools on Scotch Run as a <b>breeding</b> <b>ground.</b> Amphibians inhabiting the vernal pools on the stream include spring peepers, spotted salamanders, and wood frogs.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> for waterfowl, Lågskär has {{the status}} of an Important Bird Area (IBA) and is frequented by ornithologists who use the Lågskär Lighthouse {{buildings}} during their stay. In the past, several vessels have sunk off the coast.|$|E
5|$|Despite harsh conditions, the {{vegetation}} {{on the island}} is fairly diverse. Following the island's grazing ban, vegetation has become very thick and has resulted in it becoming a <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> for waterfowl. There is large reed bed in the small lagoon area.|$|E
50|$|It {{is still}} unclear exactly how, and for how long, the yellow-crowned night heron forms a mating pair. Some herons arrive at <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> already in pairs, meaning they either found a mate during their {{migration}} to the <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds,</b> or they have been with this mate for some time. Others form their pair or renew it upon reaching the <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Depending on latitude, {{they arrive}} on <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> mid-April to mid-May and leave between mid-August and mid-September. Migration between <b>breeding</b> and {{wintering}} <b>grounds</b> takes approximately seven weeks in both spring and autumn. Males usually arrive on <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> one week prior to arrival of females.|$|R
50|$|Male {{green-winged teal}} leave females {{at the start}} of {{incubation}} and congregate on safe waters to molt. Some populations undergo an extensive molt migration while others remain on or near <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds.</b> Females molt on <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds.</b>|$|R
5|$|Despite its sparse vegetation, the atoll {{is known}} as the <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> of a number of bird species. More than 90% of the world {{population}} of Murphy's petrel nests on Ducie, while pairs of red-tailed tropicbirds and fairy terns make around 1% of the world population for each species.|$|E
5|$|Several beaches dot Banton's coast {{including}} Macat-ang, Tabonan, Mahaba, Recodo, Togbongan, Mainit, and Tambak beaches. Some like Macat-ang, Tabonan, and Tambak {{are white}} sand beaches, while others, like Togbongan, are pebbled and rocky. The island's waters are also well-known dive sites, with corals {{that serve as}} <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> for groupers, snappers, sharks, and stingrays.|$|E
5|$|Since November 2015, whales {{gather around}} Hachijō-jima, far north from the known {{breeding}} {{areas in the}} Bonin Islands. All breeding activities except for giving births had been confirmed as of January, 2016. That makes Hachijo-jima the northernmost <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> in the world, north of breeding grounds such as Amami Ōshima, Midway Island, and Bermuda.|$|E
50|$|In emperor {{penguins}} (Aptenodytes forsteri), resource availability determines when male emperor penguins {{will be able}} {{to return}} to their <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> to initiate their courtship rituals. The greater the concentration of resources in their feeding ground, the quicker they {{will be able to}} restore their body reserves for winter, and the sooner {{they will be able to}} return to their <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds.</b> An early return to their <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> comes with an increased likelihood of finding a mate.|$|R
50|$|Many {{species of}} ducks, {{including}} the canvasback, are highly migratory, but are effectively conserved by protecting {{the places where}} they nest, {{even though they may}} be hunted away from their <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds.</b> Protecting key feeding and <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> is key for conserving many types of migratory birds.|$|R
25|$|Pools of {{stagnant}} water are <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> for disease.|$|R
5|$|Some {{complaints}} {{were raised by}} others during {{the construction of the}} freeway south of SR 94. A proposed drainage basin raised concerns about a potential <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> for mosquitoes being located near homes. Caltrans was later ordered by local courts to pay settlements in the millions of dollars to local business owners for undervaluing property taken by eminent domain.|$|E
5|$|St Kilda is a <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> {{for many}} {{important}} seabird species. One of the world's largest colonies of northern gannets, totalling 30,000 pairs, amount to 24 {{percent of the}} global population. There are 49,000 breeding pairs of Leach's petrels, up to 90 percent of the European population; 136,000 pairs of Atlantic puffins, about 30 percent of the UK total breeding population, and 67,000 northern fulmar pairs, about 13 percent of the UK total. Dùn {{is home to the}} largest colony of fulmars in Britain. Prior to 1828, St Kilda was their only UK <b>breeding</b> <b>ground,</b> but they have since spread and established colonies elsewhere, such as Fowlsheugh. The last great auk (Pinguinus impennis) seen in Britain was killed on Stac an Armin in July 1840. Unusual behaviour by St Kilda's bonxies was recorded in 2007 during research into recent falls in the Leach's petrel population. Using night vision gear, ecologists observed the skuas hunting petrels at night, a remarkable strategy for a seabird.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} early sheep types {{have survived}} on these remote islands, the Soay, a Neolithic type, and the Boreray, an Iron Age type. The islands are a <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> for many important seabird species including northern gannets, Atlantic puffins, and northern fulmars. The St Kilda wren and St Kilda field mouse are endemic subspecies.|$|E
50|$|White-throated rock thrushes inhabit their <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> between May and September. Their <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> are {{in mixed}} montane forests. They breed between May and July, forming two broods. The birds' {{cup-shaped}} nests consist of tree matter, lichen, rootlets, and moss {{on the inside}} and pine needles and stems on the outside.|$|R

5|$|Mingulay {{has a large}} seabird population, and is an {{important}} <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> for razorbills (9,514 pairs, 6.3% of the European population), guillemots (11,063 pairs) and black-legged kittiwakes (2,939 pairs). shags (694 individuals), fulmar (11,626 pairs), puffins (2,072 pairs), storm petrel, common terns, Arctic terns, bonxies and various species of gull also nest in the sea-cliffs. Manx shearwaters nested on Lianamul stack until the late 18th century, when they were driven away by puffins, and tysties have also been recorded there.|$|E
5|$|Polar {{bears are}} the iconic symbol of Svalbard, {{and one of}} the main tourist attractions. The animals are {{protected}} and people moving outside the settlements are required to have appropriate scare devices to ward off attacks. They are also advised to also carry a firearm for use as a last resort. A British schoolboy was killed by a polar bear in 2011. Svalbard and Franz Joseph Land share a common population of 3,000 polar bears, with Kong Karls Land being the most important <b>breeding</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{archipelago}} {{features an}} Arctic climate, although with significantly higher temperatures than other areas {{at the same}} latitude. The flora {{take advantage of the}} long period of midnight sun to compensate for the polar night. Svalbard is a <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> for many seabirds, and also features polar bears, reindeer, the Arctic fox, and certain marine mammals. Seven national parks and twenty-three nature reserves cover two-thirds of the archipelago, protecting the largely untouched, yet fragile, natural environment. Approximately 60% of the archipelago is covered with glaciers, and the islands feature many mountains and fjords.|$|E

5|$|The island's {{vegetation}} consists exclusively of {{mosses and lichens}} {{which have}} adapted to the extreme Antarctic climate. The island has a very harsh climate with strong winds and freezing temperatures. The steady snowfall keeps vegetation to a minimum. The island is a <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> for a few seabirds, particularly southern fulmars, but also Wilson's storm petrels and Antarctic terns. Penguins, including Adélie and chinstrap penguins, visit the island infrequently. There are numerous seals, particularly crabeater seals, leopard seals and smaller numbers of southern elephant seals.|$|E
5|$|The path now skirts Pentire Point West {{and then}} Kelsey Head to reach Holywell Bay, another surfing beach. After passing round Penhale and {{crossing}} Penhale Sands the path enters Perranporth, then climbs {{out the other}} side back onto a stretch of cliffs past Kligga Head to the village of St Agnes. Past St Agnes Head, a <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> for kittiwakes, lies the ruins of Towanroath Mine and the inlet at Chapel Porth. Next are the ruins of Wheal Charlotte mine and then Porthtowan village.|$|E
5|$|Though {{supported}} by many politicians and businesses in Alaska, {{the project was}} canceled after objections were raised. Native Alaskans in the area protested the threatened loss of nine villages that would be flooded by the dam. Conservation groups abhorred the threatened flooding of the Yukon Flats, a large area of wetlands that provides a critical <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> for millions of waterfowl. Fiscal conservatives opposed the dam {{on the grounds of}} its large cost and limited benefit to Americans outside Alaska.|$|E

500|$|Slow clicks {{are heard}} {{only in the}} {{presence}} of males (it is not certain whether females occasionally make them). [...] Males make a lot of slow clicks in <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> (74% of the time), both near the surface and at depth, which suggests they are primarily mating signals. [...] Outside <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds,</b> slow clicks are rarely heard, and usually near the surface.|$|R
50|$|The <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> {{are still}} undiscovered. While {{most of the}} data {{suggests}} a location in the southern Bismarck Archipelago, petrels are notoriously migratory and move away from their <b>breeding</b> <b>grounds</b> after the young have fledged, often for considerable distances. It is still {{more likely than not}} that the species breeds in Melanesia southeast of New Guinea, as was hypothesized at the species' discovery.|$|R
5|$|For {{much of the}} year, the {{garrison}} would be plagued by mosquitoes and the heat and humidity common to the Washington area during the summer. Though Fort Greble was built on a hill, the area immediately surrounding the fort consisted of swampy bottomland drained by the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, a <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> for malaria. Communication {{with the outside world}} was provided by the military road that served the Eastern Branch line of forts, and supply wagons would usually arrive on a weekly schedule. Trips to Washington or Uniontown from the fort were uncommon, and by virtue of its location at the extreme end of the Eastern Branch defenses, Fort Greble was isolated even from its neighboring forts.|$|E
5|$|Nationally {{important}} {{populations of}} breeding waders {{are present in}} the Outer Hebrides, including common redshank, dunlin, lapwing and ringed plover. The islands also provide a habitat for other important species such as corncrake, hen harrier, golden eagle and otter. Offshore, basking shark and various species of whale and dolphin can often be seen, and the remoter islands' seabird populations are of international significance. St Kilda has 60,000northern gannets, amounting to 24% of the world population; 49,000breeding pairs of Leach's petrel, up to 90% of the European population; and 136,000pairs of puffin and 67,000northern fulmar pairs, about 30% and 13% of the respective UK totals. Mingulay is an important <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> for razorbills, with 9,514pairs, 6.3% of the European population.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to {{the project}} was based on three {{separate}} objections to its construction: ecological, human, and financial. Conservation groups opposed the dam's construction because it would flood the Yukon Flats, a large wetland area that provides <b>breeding</b> <b>ground</b> for millions of waterfowl and habitat for game and fur-bearing animals. Alaska Native groups objected {{to the project}}'s human cost—the need to relocate more than 1,500 people and 9 villages—and Native groups outside the reservoir area objected to the potential devastation of the Yukon River salmon population. The third objection to construction of the dam stemmed from its high cost {{and the belief that}} cheap electricity would not be enough to attract industry to Alaska.|$|E
