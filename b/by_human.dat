As such, milk is a central constituent of our lives. But we do not feed on proteins, fats and carbohydrates alone. We also feed on symbols and myths. Milk is both a source of nutrition and an ingredient mode of thought. For all these reasons, milk is a deeply appropriate subject for a special issue of the ICAF Food Journal.

5|$|A key {{stress on}} both {{freshwater}} and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including water pollution, {{the building of}} dams, removal of water for use by humans, {{and the introduction of}} exotic species. An example of a fish that has become endangered because of habitat change is the pallid sturgeon, a North American freshwater fish that lives in rivers damaged <b>by</b> <b>human</b> activity.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft are {{inspected}} during {{maintenance operations}} either outdoors on an airport between flights, or in a hangar for longer-duration inspections. These inspections are conducted mainly <b>by</b> <b>human</b> operators, visually and sometimes using tools to assess defects. The project aims to improve inspections of aircraft and traceability. A database dedicated to each aircraft type, containing images and three-dimensional scans, will be updated after each maintenance. This allows for example {{to assess the}} propagation of a crack.|$|E
5|$|Almost all of Manila sits on top {{of centuries}} of prehistoric {{alluvial}} deposits built by {{the waters of the}} Pasig River and on some land reclaimed from Manila Bay. Manila's land has been altered substantially <b>by</b> <b>human</b> intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since the American colonial times. Some of the city's natural variations in topography have been evened out. , Manila had a total area of 42.88 square kilometers.|$|E
50|$|Many South Island {{bird species}} are now extinct, mainly due to hunting <b>by</b> <b>humans</b> and {{predation}} <b>by</b> cats and rats introduced <b>by</b> <b>humans.</b> Extinct species include the South Island goose, South Island giant moa, harpagornis and South Island piopio.|$|R
50|$|Lecithin has {{emulsification}} and lubricant properties, {{and is a}} surfactant. It can {{be totally}} metabolized (see Inositol) <b>by</b> <b>humans,</b> so is well tolerated <b>by</b> <b>humans</b> and nontoxic when ingested; some other emulsifiers can only be excreted via the kidneys.|$|R
50|$|Alcoholic beverages, {{typically}} containing 3 - 40% ethanol by volume, {{have been}} produced and consumed <b>by</b> <b>humans</b> since pre-historic times.

5|$|Although Triatominae bugs feed on them, birds {{appear to}} be immune to {{infection}} and therefore are {{not considered to be}} a T. cruzi reservoir. Even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters, they can re-emerge from plants or animals {{that are part of the}} ancient, sylvatic (referring to wild animals) infection cycle. This is especially likely in zones with mixed open savannah, with clumps of trees interspersed <b>by</b> <b>human</b> habitation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the wild}} {{population}} is in decline because of predation by feral animals and habitat loss caused <b>by</b> <b>human</b> agricultural development, {{the numbers of}} iguanas have been bolstered {{as a result of}} captive-breeding and other conservation programs. Cyclura nubila has been used to study evolution and animal communication, and its captive-breeding program has been a model for other endangered lizards in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|C.maenas has {{the ability}} to {{disperse}} by a variety of mechanisms, including ballast water, ships' hulls, packing materials (seaweeds) used to ship live marine organisms, bivalves moved for aquaculture, rafting, migration of crab larvae on ocean currents, and the movement of submerged aquatic vegetation for coastal zone management initiatives. Thresher et al. found C.maenas dispersed in Australia mainly by rare long-distance events, possibly caused <b>by</b> <b>human</b> actions.|$|E
50|$|Many {{large animals}} on islands have been hunted to {{extinction}} <b>by</b> <b>humans.</b> A well-known {{example is the}} dodo, once found {{on the island of}} Mauritius.

5|$|Deep water coral {{habitats}} {{are also}} threatened <b>by</b> <b>human</b> activities, particularly by indiscriminate trawling. These ecosystems have been little studied, {{but in the}} perpetual darkness and cold temperatures, animals grow and mature slowly and there are relatively fewer fish worth catching than in the sunlit waters above.

5|$|Humans play a {{key role}} in the biosphere, with the large human {{population}} dominating many of Earth's ecosystems. This has resulted in a widespread, ongoing mass extinction of other species during the present geological epoch, now known as the Holocene extinction. The large-scale loss of species caused <b>by</b> <b>human</b> influence since the 1950s has been called a biotic crisis, with an estimated 10% of the total species lost as of 2007. At current rates, about 30% of species are at risk of extinction in the next hundred years. The Holocene extinction event is the result of habitat destruction, the widespread distribution of invasive species, hunting, and climate change. In the present day, human activity has had a significant impact on the surface of the planet. More than a third of the land surface has been modified <b>by</b> <b>human</b> actions, and humans use about 20% of global primary production. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by close to 30% since the start of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Hybridization {{is greatly}} {{influenced}} <b>by</b> <b>human</b> {{impact on the}} environment, through effects such as habitat fragmentation and species introductions.

Humans have introduced species worldwide to environments for a long time, both intentionally for purposes such as biological control, and unintentionally, as with accidental escapes of individuals. Introductions can drastically affect populations, including through hybridization.|$|E
