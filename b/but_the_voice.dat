25|$|Over {{the last}} ten years, the {{national}} and international stages have drastically changed. People across North America and the world are divided by religion, race, politics and economics. A divided world needs the unifying voice of Christ. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of Christ, {{if it is to}} properly convey its healing power, demands the unity of His Church here and across the globe. The work begun ten years ago must continue and be brought to fruition. As long as there are those who hear and do the word of the Lord in North America, the message of Ligonier will not be silenced.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the close}} {{resemblance}} {{of his voice}} to the legendary singer Mukesh (Mukesh Chand Mathur), Babla began his career recording covers of Mukesh songs for T-Series. Then one day, in 1990, seminal Indian film composer R.D. Burman was passing through Khar, Mumbai, {{when he heard the}} song ‘Sajan re jhoothmut bolo’ blaring from an audio cassette shop. Burman commented on how well Mukesh had sung the song, and was surprised to learn it was not Mukesh, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of Babla coming from the shop. He was so impressed he contacted Babla and asked to meet him the very next day. Then Pancham Da took Babla under his wing, and he became a regular singer in Pancham Da’s live shows. Unfortunately, Puncham Da’s failing health delayed his film music debut.|$|E
25|$|They lead Arindal to {{a portal}} guarded by earth spirits. He {{is about to}} be {{defeated}} when the voice of Groma reminds him of the shield. The earth spirits disappear when he holds it up. The fairies express their surprise but are sure he will not triumph again. Meanwhile, he thanks Groma's power. Next they encounter bronze men who guard a holy sanctuary. The shield fails Arindal but when Groma advises him to hold up the sword, the bronze men vanish. The fairies again express their surprise whilst Groma's spirit urges Arindal on. They now have reached a grotto where Ada has been turned to stone. The two fairies taunt Arindal with the threat that failure will mean that he too is turned to stone. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of Groma urges him to play the lyre. When he does so (O ihr, des Busens Hochgefühle), Ada is freed from the stone. The two fairies realise that Groma is responsible.|$|E

500|$|Jackson has a soprano vocal range. Over {{the course}} of her career, she has {{received}} frequent criticism for the limits of her vocal capabilities, especially in comparison to contemporary artists such as Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. In comparing her vocal technique to Houston and Aretha Franklin, vocal coach Roger Love states that [...] "hen Janet sings, she allows a tremendous amount of air to come through. She's obviously aiming for a sexy, sultry effect, and on one level that works nicely. But actually, it's fairly limited." [...] He adds that while her voice is suitable for studio recording, it doesn't translate well to stage because despite having [...] "great songs, incredible dancing, and her star like presence, the live show is still magnificent. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> is not the star." [...] Biographer David Ritz commented, [...] "on Janet's albums—and in her videos and live performances, which revealed a crisp, athletic dance technique [...] singing wasn't the point," [...] saying emphasis was placed on [...] "her slamming beats, infectious hooks, and impeccable production values." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant magazine claimed critics opposing her small voice [...] "somehow missed the explosive 'gimme a beat' vocal pyrotechnics she unleashes all over 'Nasty'... Or that they completely dismissed how perfect her tremulous hesitance fits into the abstinence anthem 'Let's Wait Awhile'." [...] Classical composer Louis Andriessen has praised Jackson for her [...] "rubato, sense of rhythm, sensitivity, and the childlike quality of her strangely erotic voice." [...] Several critics also consider her voice to often be enveloped within her music's production. Music critic J. D. Considine noted [...] "on albums, Jackson's sound isn't defined by her voice so much as by the way her voice is framed by the lush, propulsive production of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis." [...] Wendy Robinson of PopMatters said [...] "the power of Janet Jackson's voice does not lie in her pipes. She doesn't blow, she whispers... Jackson's confectionary vocals are masterfully complemented by gentle harmonies and balanced out by pulsing rhythms, so she's never unpleasant to listen to." [...] Matthew Perpetus of Fluxblog suggested Jackson's vocal techniques as a study for indie rock music, considering it to possess [...] "a somewhat subliminal effect on the listener, guiding and emphasizing dynamic shifts without distracting attention from its primal hooks." [...] Perpetus added: [...] "Her voice effortlessly transitions from a rhythmic toughness to soulful emoting to a flirty softness without overselling any aspect of her performance... a continuum of emotions and attitudes that add up to the impression that we're listening to the expression of a formed human being with contradictions and complexities." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Judges of Appeal {{felt that}} since the {{authority}} of the Government emanates from the people, every voter is entitled to have a member representing them and speaking on their behalf in Parliament. As such, the Court felt that an MP is [...] "not just the mouthpiece <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> {{of the people of the}} constituency". This is especially the case in a Single Member Constituency where voters only have a single representative in Parliament. The court thus felt that Article 49 does impose a duty upon the Prime Minister to call a by-election to fill casual vacancies in SMCs, unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.|$|E
2500|$|Combining {{these two}} things, shoegaze act My Bloody Valentine have {{influenced}} Parker's music with their contrasting combination of loud guitars and ethereal melodies. Parker has [...] "always {{been in love}} with the wall of sound as employed by My Bloody Valentine" [...] and he tries to capture that [...] "melancholy dreamy feel". Parker tries to incorporate this balance into his own music. [...] "If I was singing, I wouldn't be able to match the tone of the instruments, which is really crunchy. The instruments are quite sonically brutal, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> is really soft, and I think that kind of resonates with people. It's kind of like My Bloody Valentine, where it's really brutal sounding, but kind of beautiful at the same time." [...] Tame Impala live keyboardist Jay Waston has described Parker's music as containing [...] "shoegazey guitar sound, but not played in a shoegazey manner".|$|E
