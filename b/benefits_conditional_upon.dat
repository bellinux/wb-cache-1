40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} active labour market programs on the duration of unemployment in a reward or punish system. In Switzerland, unemployment <b>benefits</b> are <b>conditional</b> <b>upon</b> program attendance after 7 months of unemployment duration. In the evaluation we allow for selectivity affecting the inflow into programs. Our results indicate that (i) After ALMP-participation the transition rate to jobs increases for Swiss women but not for Swiss men. However, the job hazard rate is strongly reduced during participation. Taken together, {{this leads to the}} conclusion that programs prolong unemployment duration for men, but tend to shorten duration for women. (ii) Once the unemployment spell approaches the expiration of unconditional benefit entitlement the job-hazard rate increases strongly, both for women and for men. (iii) We do not find important selectivity effects, neither for males, nor females. active labour market policy; Benefit Entitlement; Bivariate Duration Model; Treatment Effect...|$|R
30|$|In 2008 the new Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) program {{replaced}} IB {{as well as}} IS {{on grounds}} of disability for new applicants. This new program of insurance-based benefit for those with sufficient work history and means-tested social assistance benefit for those without sufficient work history included a new tougher Work Capability Assessment, with fewer exemptions, {{in place of the}} existing system of Personal Capability Assessments (see Sissons 2009). The requirement to attend work-focused interviews introduced under Pathways to Work has been extended into a requirement to engage in work-related activity for all but the most severely disabled, linked explicitly to payments, with around one quarter of the existing <b>benefit</b> payment made <b>conditional</b> <b>upon</b> compliance. There is also no longer a higher rate of payment for longer-duration claims. Sissons (2009) interprets the lack of growth in disability recipiency rates over the period 2008 – 2009 as evidence that they have ceased to play a role as a major destination for the hidden unemployed.|$|R
40|$|The role {{of health}} {{knowledge}} in consumer use of nutritional labels on food packages is explored {{using data from}} the 1995 Diet and Health Knowledge Survey. Two types of label use models, a binary choice label use model and a level of label use model, are employed with particular attention given to the endogeneity of health knowledge. The binary choice model is concerned with factors affecting the probability of label use. The level of label use model deals with factors affecting the number of food products in which label use occurred. The results show that health knowledge has a significant role in increasing label use. Most diets of Americans still fall short of the Di-etary Guidelines for Americans (Frazao). Several scientific reports also suggest that a large percent-age of health risks is related to diet and lifestyle choices. For example, the National Cancer Institute estimates that 35 ?Lo of cancer deaths are linked to diet. There are almost 1. 4 million new cancer cases in the United States each year, and more than 500, 000 deaths from this disease. With rising sci-entific knowledge about the role that dietary choices play in preventing diseases, simple dietary changes could {{have a significant impact on}} reduc-ing disease rates. In an effort to make information available and to teach consumers how to use nutritional informa-tion, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) now requires nutritional labels on food packages. The objective is to provide consistent, understandable, and usable labels that can help consumers make healthier food choices. The implementation of the NLEA is estimated to cost food processors between $ 1. 4 billion and $ 2. 3 bil-lion over the next 20 years (U. S. Food and Drug Administration). Even though the benefits to pub-lic health—measured in monetary terms—are ex-pected to well exceed the cost, the <b>benefits</b> are <b>conditional</b> <b>upon</b> consumer use.

40|$|The main aim of {{labour market}} {{activation}} policies {{is to bring}} jobless people from unemployment or inactivity into work or, at the very least, to influence the employment prospects of the unemployed positively. Activation schemes typically make <b>benefit</b> receipt <b>conditional</b> <b>upon</b> job search activities, acceptance of available job offers and participation in training activities. This article addresses the appropriate role of the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) {{in the establishment of}} activation in South Africa. It focuses on a number of principled and practical considerations and constraints that challenge the use of activation mechanisms, such as the fragmentation of the existing legal and institutional frameworks, the lack of available employment opportunities and human rights considerations. It is argued that the limited and short-term impact of the UIF, its strong labour-market orientation and its inability to appropriately contribute to preventing and combating unemployment or to reintegrate the unemployed into the labour market all point to the urgent need to reform the UIF. The gaps in the current unemployment insurance system are highlighted, as is the need to enhance the relationship between the unemployment insurance system and (appropriate) activation measures. The role of existing social security and employment creation initiatives in this dynamic is also considered. In particular, the absence of a link between those excluded from the UIF and the activation mechanisms introduced by the Skills Development Act 97 of 1998 is underscored. Proposals contained in the Employment Services Bill are also evaluated. It is suggested that an expanded form of employment services provision, incorporating a network of labour centres, ought to receive prioritisation in the South African context. This must be coupled with a move to consolidate the various available governmental databases in terms of which unemployed persons may register as job-seekers. The creation of an enabling framework to achieve such goals would require a variety of legislative changes, some of which are discussed in the article...|$|R

40|$|Although {{unconditional}} {{unemployment benefits}} destroy jobs in competitive and noncompetitive labor markets, <b>conditional</b> <b>benefits</b> can spur job growth in noncompetitive labor markets. Unconditional benefits reduce the penalty of shirking and misconduct, while <b>conditional</b> <b>benefits</b> increase this penalty. This is shown for the efficiency-wage, no-shirking {{model of the}} labor market developed by Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984). Switching from unconditional to <b>conditional</b> <b>benefits</b> lowers unemployment. Tough eligibility requirements are thus important components of the welfare state. However, if <b>conditional</b> <b>benefits</b> are financed by a payroll tax, <b>conditional</b> <b>benefits</b> exert upward wage pressure so that unemployment falls by less and may even increase.
