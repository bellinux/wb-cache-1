5|$|Each of the valid Band1 {{permutations}} can {{be expanded}} (completed) into a specific number of solutions with the Band2,3 permutations. By {{virtue of their}} similarity, each member of an equivalence class {{will have the same}} number of completions. Consequently, we only need to construct the solutions for one member of each equivalence class and then multiply the number of solutions <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the equivalence class. We are still left with the task of identifying and calculating the size of each equivalence class. Further progress requires the dexterous application of computational techniques to catalogue (classify and count) the permutations into equivalence classes.|$|E

5|$|Lung cancers are {{classified}} according to histological type. This classification {{is important for}} determining management and predicting outcomes of the disease. Lung cancers are carcinomas—malignancies that arise from epithelial cells. Lung carcinomas are categorized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a microscope. For therapeutic purposes, two broad classes are distinguished: non-small-cell lung carcinoma and small-cell lung carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|The DLM {{operates}} under a decentralized {{framework in}} which internal movements are encouraged and represented in a national body. The party's constituency elects a National Assembly, the principal decision-making body, through proportional representation, where every internal movement forms a list. Composed of 51 to 101 members, determined proportionately <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the constituency, it maintains political priorities, alliances, and rhetoric, and elects an Executive Committee of 9 to 15 members for daily organizational activities. Other organizational bodies include the Legal Committee and Financial Committee, and internal elections occur every three years.|$|E

5|$|When Léon Théry won the 1904 {{race for}} the French {{manufacturer}} Richard-Brasier, the French automobile industry proposed to the ACF that they modify {{the format of the}} 1905 Gordon Bennett race and run it simultaneously with an event which did not limit entries by nation. The ACF accepted the proposal, but decided that instead of removing limits to entries by nation, the limits would remain but would be determined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of each country's industry. Under the ACF's proposal, France was allowed fifteen entries, Germany and Britain six, and the remaining countries—Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria and the United States—three cars each.|$|E
5|$|And so matters stood {{until the}} massive PAVN/NLF Tet Offensive of early 1968. Although a {{tactical}} victory for American and South Vietnamese forces, Tet became a political disaster.

5|$|By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes {{had begun}} invading Italy {{from the north}} as their culture {{expanded}} throughout Europe. Most of this was unknown to the Romans at this time, who still had purely local security concerns, but the Romans were alerted when a particularly warlike tribe, the Senones, invaded the Etruscan province of Siena {{from the north and}} attacked the town of Clusium, not far from Rome's sphere of influence. The Clusians, overwhelmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the enemy in numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. Perhaps unintentionally the Romans found themselves not just in conflict with the Senones, but their primary target. The Romans met them in pitched battle at the Battle of the Allia around 390–387 BC. The Gauls, under their chieftain Brennus, defeated the Roman army of around 15,000 troops and proceeded to pursue the fleeing Romans back to Rome itself and partially sacked the town before being either driven off or bought off.|$|E
5|$|Not many predators {{challenge}} {{an adult}} black mamba {{although it does}} face a few threats such as birds of prey, particularly snake eagles. Although all species of snake eagle commonly prey on snakes, there are two species in particular that do so with high frequency, including preying on black mambas. These are the black-chested snake eagle (Circaetus pectoralis) and the brown snake eagle (Circaetus cinereus). The Cape file snake (Mehelya capensis), which is apparently immune to all African snake venoms and preys on other snakes including venomous ones, is a common predator of black mambas (limited only <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> it can swallow). Mongooses, which also are partially immune to venom, and are often quick enough to evade a bite, will sometimes tackle a black mamba for prey. Humans do not usually consume black mambas, but they often kill them out of fear.|$|E

The operation was always restricted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of Keadby Lock, although vessels longer than the lock could pass through when the river was level with the canal and both sets of gates could be opened. The largest ship to be built required Dunston's to build a dam across the canal, as the canal company feared that it might get stuck in the lock, resulting in flooding and draining of the canal.|$|E
5|$|Virtually all {{microbes}} {{can trigger}} an antibody response. Successful recognition and eradication {{of many different}} types of microbes requires diversity among antibodies; their amino acid composition varies allowing them to interact with many different antigens. It has been estimated that humans generate about 10billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen. Although a huge repertoire of different antibodies is generated in a single individual, the number of genes available to make these proteins is limited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the human genome. Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved that allow vertebrate B cells to generate a diverse pool of antibodies from {{a relatively small number of}} antibody genes.|$|E

He acquired a social life, and met Irita Van Doren, the book review editor of the New York Herald Tribune who became a friend, and later his lover. Cultured, brilliant and well connected, Van Doren introduced him to new books, new ideas, and new circles of friends. Unlike Van Doren, Willkie was indiscreet about their relationship, and their affair was well known to the reporters covering him during his 1940 presidential campaign. None of them printed a word.|$|E
