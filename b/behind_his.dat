5|$|In {{an echo of}} the Iliad, Achilles drags {{the corpse}} <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> horse. Thus, the {{comparison}} with the Homeric Hector is heightened and, at the same time, aspects of the classical Troilus's fate are echoed.|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{the figures}} are generic {{representations}} of human forms in various walks and stages of life, Taft included himself, {{with one of his}} assistants following him, along {{the west side of the}} sculpture. He is portrayed wearing a smock, with his head bowed and hands clasped <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> back. His daughters served as models for some of the figures.|$|E

5|$|Chambers transitioned {{into the}} senior ranks soon after, taking the 100m silver medal <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> British {{teammate}} Darren Campbell at the 1998 European Championships. He achieved a new personal best in September at the 1998 IAAF World Cup with {{a run of}} 10.03s for third place and won a relay gold medal. At the 1998 Commonwealth Games he was a 100m semi finalist and set a games record {{as part of the}} 4×100m relay team. His ability attracted the attention of former sprinter and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Mike McFarlane, who became his coach. He came first in the 100m in the 1999 European Cup, then at a meet in Nuremberg he became only the second European sprinter (after Linford Christie) to break the ten second barrier with a time of 9.99s. Fellow British sprinter Jason Gardener scored a time of 9.98s in Lausanne soon after, becoming the third Briton to break the barrier. In spite of this, Chambers remained some distance <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> North American counterparts.|$|E
