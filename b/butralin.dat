40|$|Two field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to study the effect of multi strains biofertilizer (phosphate dissolving bacteria, Azospirillum spp. and Pseudomonas spp.) with different levels of NPK fertilizer (50 and 75 % of recommended rate) under different weed control treatments, including 4 plant mulches (sawdust, rice straw, clover weed or cogongrass) as well as hand hoeing and <b>butralin</b> herbicide with one hoeing on onion plants and associated weeds. Counts of Azospirillum spp. in biofertilized rhizosphere recorded higher densities with 50 % NPK application, while counts of phosphate dissolving bacteria and Pseudomonas spp. showed higher populations with 75 % NPK application under different weed control treatments. Generally, hand hoeing treatment recorded higher counts of tested microorganisms in onion rhizosphere as compared to unweeded check, <b>butralin</b> herbicide and applied different plant mulches except clover weed mulch treatments. Numbers of broad- leaved weeds were significantly decreased by increasing the rate of NPK fertilizer, in the presence and absence of biofertilization, while the grassy weed was increased. Broad-leaved weeds were more susceptible than grassy weed to mulching treatments. Application of hand-hoeing (trice), sawdust mulch, rice straw mulch, clover weed mulch, cogongrass mulch and <b>butralin</b> herbicide + one hoeing decreased significantly the total dry weight of weeds at 75 days from transplanting and produced higher bulb yields over unweeded by 143. 2, 127. 2, 118. 1, 151. 6, 123. 1 and 133. 3 % respectively. No significant difference in marketable bulb yield was detected between biofertilizer + 75 % NPK and 100 % NPK application, under different weed control treatments. The highest values of N and P content in onion bulbs were obtained {{as a result of}} combined action of biofertilizer and 75 % NPK under different weed control treatments. However, sawdust mulch treatment recorded the greatest value of N-content in the presence of biofertilizer + 50 % NPK, while Zn and Fe contents reached their highest values under 100 % NPK applicatio...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the Experimental Farm of the Faculty of Agriculture, Ain Shams University, EL-Bustan Region, Beheira Governorate (sandy soil), to clarify the role of herbigation technique in weed control and minimizing the environmental pollution. Three methods were applied for weed control in the investigation which were: <b>Butralin</b> herbicide (Amex) was applied through trickle and sprinkler irrigation systems with three application rates (1. 25, 1. 875 and 2. 50 l/fed) after three weeks from planting, <b>Butralin</b> herbicide was applied with conventional spraying method by using knapsack sprayer {{at a rate of}} 2. 50 l/fed, and hoe weeding method by using locally hoe. In addition, no weeding was used as a control treatment. The results of this study revealed that: 1 - The highest yield of pea was obtained when using trickle irrigation (2. 46 ton/fed) compared to sprinkler irrigation (1. 98 ton/fed) by increasing of 19. 5 %. 2 - Hand hoeing method gave the best effective control of weeds compared with the other methods of weed control (spraying and herbigation). 3 - Eradication efficiency of weeds under herbigation systems increased by increasing the herbicide application rate. 4 - The highest pea yield was (2. 46 and 1. 98 Mg/fed) under hoe weeding method as compared with that of the conventional spraying method (2. 11 and 1. 79 ton/fed.) and herbigation through irrigation water (1. 78 and 1. 50 Mg/fed.) at herbicide application rate of 2. 5 l/fed with trickle and sprinkler irrigation systems, respectively...|$|E
40|$|During 1997 and 1998, in the {{province}} of Perugia (Umbria, central Italy), four field experimental trials were carried out to study the control of broomrape (OrobancheramosaL.) in Virginia tobacco. In 1997, maleic hydrazide (2040 mL ha- 1), flumetralin (1200 mL ha- 1), n-decanol (10720 mL ha- 1), glyphosate (180 - 324 mL ha- 1) and rimsulfuron (12. 5 - 25 g ha- 1) were tested on the variety K 394. In the second year, maleic hydrazide (2040 mL ha- 1), n-decanol (10720 mL ha- 1) and <b>butralin</b> (2160 mL ha- 1) were utilised in the same variety. Furthermore, a field experiment was performed to assess the susceptibility of different untopped Virginia tobacco varieties to broomrape. The presence of the weed was recorded as the number of the aboveground broomrape plants per m 2 and after harvest dry weight was determined. Maleic hydrazide proved to be highly effective against the parasitic weed when used at the early flowering stage of the crop, reducing by 95 % and 73 %, on average, the number of broomrape plants with respect to the untreated control, respectively in 1997 and 1998. Rimsulfuron, used 55 days after transplanting, had a satisfactory activity against broomrape (reduction of 50 - 70 %). A double treatment with glyphosate caused a reduction of 100 % of broomrape but it significantly depressed tobacco yield. Flumetralin, n-decanol and <b>butralin</b> did not show any control of broomrape. The variety BC 60 FB was found to be highly resistant to the weed with an average of 85 % reduction in broomrape plants compared to the other varieties in the experiment...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{some natural}} and plastic mulches (rice straw, {{black and white}} plastic) as well as hand hoeing and <b>butralin</b> {{herbicide}} under bio-organic fertilization were evaluated for their effects on some beneficial rhizosphere microorganisms, weeds, growth and yield of pea plants during 1998 / 1999 and 1999 / 2000 seasons. Densities of phosphate dissolving bacteria and Pseudomonas spp. in biofertilized rhizosphere were always higher {{in the presence of}} farmyard manuring (25 or 50 m 3 /fed.) compared to chemical fertilizer under weed control treatments. The mulch treatments (rice straw, black and white plastic) recorded a marked positive effect on the counts of tested microorganisms in the rhizosphere as compared to <b>butralin</b> herbicide and unweeded control treatment. Biofertilizers associated with farmyard manure at the rate of 50 m 3 /fed under hand hoeing treatment, yielded higher fresh weight and number of nodules in pea plants. On the other hand, presence of weeds reduced fresh weight and number of nodules, seed index, number of pods per plant and pod yield per fed. Application of different weed control treatments caused a significant reduction in number and dry weight of weeds. The best weed control was obtained by black plastic mulch, followed by hand hoeing and rice straw mulch treatments. Associating biofertilizer with farmyard manure at rate of 50 m 3 /fed exhibited the greatest pod yield and significant increase in the fresh and dry weight of seeds when compared with farmyard manure at rate of 25 m 3 /fed. and chemical fertilizer application under weed control treatments. The highest concentrations of N, P, K, Zn and Mn elements in pea seeds were achieved, due to combined action of biofertilizer and 50 m 3 /fed. of farmyard manure under controlling weeds by hand hoeing treatment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{examined}} the effects of pesticides on the central and peripheral nervous system in the setting of a tobacco farm at a developing country. Maximal motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities (MCV and SCV, respectively) in the median, sural and tibial nerves, postural sway, and brain-evoked potentials (auditory event-related and visual-evoked potentials) were measured in 80 male tobacco farmers and age- and sex-matched 40 controls in Kelantan, Malaysia. Median SCV (finger-wrist) in farmers using Delsen (mancozeb, dithiocarbamate fungicide), who showed significant decrease of serum cholinesterase activities, were significantly lower compared with the controls. Sural SCV in farmers using Fastac (α-cypermethrin, pyrethroid insecticide) and median MCV (elbowwrist) in farmers using Tamex (<b>butralin,</b> dinitroaniline herbicide) were significantly slowed compared with their respective controls. In Delsen (mancozeb, dithiocarbamate) users, the power of postural sway of 0 – 1 Hz was significantly larger than that in the controls both in the anterior-posterior direction with eyes open and in the right-left direction with eyes closed. The former type of sway was als...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} at Tobacco Research Station Khan Ghari, Mardan, (NWFP) - Pakistan during spring 2003 to study the impact of herbicides on some agronomic and chemical characteristics of flue-cured virginia (FCV) tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). The experiment was laid out in RCB design, replicated four times with ten treatments, comprising hand weeding, weedy check, pre-transplanting herbicides; S-metalocholar @ 1. 92, pendimethalin (EC) @ 1. 00, pendimethalin (CS) @ 1. 00, and <b>butralin</b> @ 1. 44 kg a. i ha- 1 and the post-transplanting herbicides include; clodinafop @ 0. 04, fenoxaprop-p-ethyl @ 1. 00, acetochlor @ 0. 125 and glyphosate @ 0. 95 kg a. i ha- 1. None of the herbicides except S-metalocholar had a phytotoxic effect on tobacco. All the parameters except the number of leaves plant- 1 were significantly affected by different treatments. The highest (228. 3) weeds density m- 2 was observed in weedy check while minimum (69) was recorded in pendimethalin (EC) treatment. The maximum grade index of 74. 60 % was recorded in acetochlor and minimum grade index of 53. 88 % was recorded in S-metalocholar treatments. Nicotine (%) was higher in pendimethalin (EC) treated plots with 2. 362 %; however it was comparable to all other treatments. The maximum percent reducing sugar of 18. 22 % was recorded in pendimethalin (CS) treatment, while minimum of 12. 42 % reducing sugar was recorded in weedy check. Similarly maximum yield of 2465 kg ha- 1 was recorded in pendimethalin (EC) treatment and minimum yield of 1703 kg ha- 1 was recorded in weedy check (control) treatment. Thus {{it can be concluded}} from the experiment that herbicides proved effective against weeds and their growth and promoted tobacco quality and yield. Hence the use of herbicides not only increases the net income of the farmers but also will make the weed seed bank poorer...|$|E
40|$|Clay {{minerals}} {{are known}} to interact {{with a wide variety}} of organic molecules by adsorption, intercala-tion, cation exchange, and catalysis. In soil science and environmental engineering these interactions should be better known in order to describe and predict the transport of organic compounds through soil. Studies on the binding and transformation f well-defined or-ganic compounds on pure clay minerals can provide models for interpreting the behavior of organic ma-terials in soil. However, additional variables must be considered when dealing with the natural environment in soil. Among the clay minerals, montmorillonite (smectite) is an important component of many soils and shows interesting behavior in clay-organic inter-actions because it has unusual intercalation properties that afford opportunities to catalyze a wide variety of organic reactions (Ortego et al., 1991). Aniline and its substituted erivatives are compo-nents of numerous herbicides and many pesticides. They can be readily liberated by partial degradation to free aromatic amines in soil environments. In partic-ular, nitroanilines are residues of herbicides bound as <b>butralin</b> (Helling and Krivonak, 1978), trifluralin (Sei-beret al., 1975; Golab et al., 1979), and benefin (Golab et al., 1970). Interactions of organic compounds with montmo-rillonite depend on the composition and the structure of the organic molecules and the kinds of metal cations located on exchange sites of clay. Therefore, it seemed interesting for us to study the interactions ofp-nitroan-iline and p-methoxyaniline with montmorillonite as a function of different exchangeable cations. EXPERIMENTAL The organic reagents (p-nitroaniline and p-meth-oxyaniline) were analytical-grade chemicals from Al-drich and were used without further purification.

40|$|Two field {{experiments}} were {{conducted at the}} experimental farm of the National Research Centre at Shalakan, Kalubia Governorate, Egypt, during 2006 and 2007 seasons, to study the effect of three pre-emergence herbicides, prometryn [{{at the rate of}} 0. 75, 1. 5 and 2. 25 kg ha- 1], oxadiargyl [at the rate of 240, 480 and 720 g ha- 1] and <b>butralin</b> [at the rate of 1. 20, 2. 40 and 3. 36 kg ha- 1], two hand hoeing treatments and a nonweeded check, on weed infestation, nodulation, growth, yield and yield attributes of soybean plants. Two hand hoeing treatments resulted in the highest weed depression expressed as the lowest fresh and dry weights of broadleaved, grassy and total weeds. The reduction percentage in weed dry matter compared to the nonweeded treatment was 98. 3, 92. 64 and 96. 9 % in broadleaved, grassy and total weeds, respectively. Application of the three herbicides at higher or recommended doses significantly reduced fresh and dry weight of the weeds compared to the nonweeded treatment. The results indicated that all the three herbicides at rates higher than the recommended markedly decreased the number, fresh and dry weight of nodules as well as root, shoot and total dry weight plant- 1, while application of two hand hoeing treatments significantly increased these traits. Two hand hoeing treatments and pre-emergence herbicides at the recommended rates markedly increased soybean yield and its attributes. Two hand hoeing treatments gave the highest values of number of pods per plant- 1, weight of pods per plant- 1 and number of seeds per plant- 1 by 140. 7, 150. 0 and 59. 8 %, respectively, compared to the nonweeded treatment. On the other hand, oxadiargyl at the recommended rate (480 g ha- 1) was the best treatment for promoting seed yield (g plant- 1), seed yield (kg ha- 1) and biological yield (g plant- 1) compared to the nonweeded treatment by 87. 3, 85. 0 and 88. 2 %, respectively. Prometryn at the rate of 1. 50 kg ha- 1, followed by two hand hoeing treatments, produced the highest shoot and seed protein percentage as well as seed oil percentage, compared to the other weed control treatments. Dois experimentos de campo foram conduzidos na fazenda experimental do Centro de Pesquisa Nacional em Shalakan, Kalubia Governorate, Egito, durante 2006 e 2007, para estudar o efeito de três herbicidas de pré-emergência, prometryn [doses de 0. 75, 1. 5 e 2. 25 kg ha- 1], oxadiargyl [doses de 240, 480 e 720 g ha- 1] e <b>butralin</b> [doses de 1. 20, 2. 40 e 3. 36 kg ha- 1], dois tratamentos capinados e um controle sem capina, avaliando a infestação de plantas daninhas, a nodulação, o crescimento, o rendimento, e os componentes do rendimento em plantas de soja. Dois tratamentos resultaram em maior redução de plantas daninhas expressa em menores pesos frescos e secos das plantas dicotiledôneas, gramíneas e total. A percentagem de matérias das plantas daninhas comparada ao tratamento sem capina foi de 98. 3, 92. 64 e 96. 9 % em dicotiledôneas, gramíneas e total de plantas infestantes, respectivamente. A aplicação de três herbicidas em doses maiores ou nas doses recomendadas reduziu significantemente o peso fresco e seco das plantas daninhas comparado com o tratamento com capina. Os resultados indicaram que todos os três herbicidas nas maiores doses diminuíram o número, peso fresco e seco dos nódulos, raiz, caule e peso seco total da planta, enquanto duas capinas manuais aumentaram significativamente das características citadas. Duas capinas manuais e os herbicidas de pré-emergência aplicados nas doses recomendadas aumentaram o rendimento da soja e seus atributos. Duas capinas manuais produziram maiores números de vagens por planta, peso de vagem por planta e número de sementes por planta em 140, 7; 150, 0 e 59, 8 %, respectivamente, comparado ao tratamento capinado.
