5|$|In 1852, {{the family}} moved from Niles to Poland, Ohio so that their {{children}} could attend the <b>better</b> <b>schools</b> there. Graduating from Poland Seminary in 1859, he enrolled the following year at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. He remained at Allegheny for only one year, returning home in 1860 after becoming ill and depressed. He also spent time at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio as a board member. Although his health recovered, family finances declined and McKinley was unable to return to Allegheny, first working as a postal clerk and later taking a job teaching at a school near Poland, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Many of Khrushchev's {{innovations}} {{were reversed}} after his fall. The requirement that one-third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, {{as was the}} division in the Party structure between industrial and agricultural sectors. His vocational education program {{for high school students}} was also dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended. However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures, which lacked elevators or balconies. He began to change the economic base of the country, away from heavy industry beginning light, consumer industries. People were required to register to attend, and church-going would bar you from party membership, from promotion, from better housing and your children {{would not be able to}} get into the <b>better</b> <b>schools.</b>|$|E
5|$|The route {{begins at}} I-5 near the Mexican border {{in a far}} south part of San Ysidro, a {{neighborhood}} of San Diego. As it starts its journey northward, it quickly has a junction with State Route905 (SR905) before exiting the city of San Diego and entering Chula Vista. Within the past 20years the freeway has delineated the apparent divide {{between rich and poor}} in the city of Chula Vista; those on {{the eastern side of the}} freeway have been more affluent and have <b>better</b> <b>schools</b> compared to those on the western side. Just outside the city, I-805 meets County Route S17 (CRS17), also named Bonita Road, before coming to an interchange with SR54. The freeway then enters National City, where it intersects Sweetwater Road and Plaza Boulevard, before leaving the city and reentering the city of San Diego.|$|E

25|$|Between 1956 and 1964, {{he worked}} for several years in {{advertising}} and then primarily for nonprofit institutions, including as regional director for the National Citizens Council for <b>Better</b> <b>Schools</b> and then as {{vice president in charge}} of public affairs for the New School for Social Research. From 1963 to 1964, he served as executive director of the United States Committee for the United Nations.|$|E
25|$|By some measures, the 1970s {{were the}} worst period in Harlem's history. Many of those Harlemites {{who were able to}} escape from poverty left the {{neighborhood}} in search of safer streets, <b>better</b> <b>schools</b> and homes. Those who remained were the poorest and least skilled, with the fewest opportunities for success. Though the federal government's Model Cities Program spent $100 million on job training, health care, education, public safety, sanitation, housing, and other projects over a ten-year period, Harlem showed no improvement.|$|E

25|$|After his father's death {{his mother}} moved {{the family to}} Andover, Massachusetts to find <b>better</b> <b>schools</b> for her children. The {{substantial}} estate left by her husband was managed by her husband's family. By the fall of 1878 the money had been lost or stolen and Martha Gilbreth {{had to find a}} way to make a living. She moved the family to Boston where there were good public schools. She opened a boarding house since the salary of a schoolteacher would not support the family.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, Falls Church {{opted to}} leave Fairfax County and form an {{independent}} city in 1948. Its reasons were simple: town residents valued education, and wanted <b>better</b> <b>schools</b> with as few blacks as possible. Fairfax County, then very rural, was not keen {{to devote more}} money to improve its schools. Almost immediately after municipal independence in 1958 a modernization and rebuilding program was launched for the city's schools, and music and arts programs were started. Schools remain a fundamental and foundational principle in Falls Church today.|$|E
25|$|Many groups mobilized in Harlem in the 1960s, {{fighting}} for <b>better</b> <b>schools,</b> jobs, and housing. Some were peaceful and others advocated violence. By the early 1960s, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) had offices on 125th street, and acted as negotiator {{for the community}} with the city, especially in times of racial unrest. They urged civilian review boards to hear complaints of police abuse, a demand that was ultimately met. As chairman of the House Committee of Education and Labor {{at the start of}} the 1960s, Adam Clayton Powell Jr. used this position to direct federal funds to various development projects in Harlem.|$|E

50|$|The {{quality of}} schools in Nepal has also been questioned. More {{resources}} are needed to fund the schools and particularly to provide <b>better</b> <b>school</b> facilities. Schools also lack skilled and competent teachers; more quality teacher training is necessary. In addition, more comprehensive curricula are needed to accommodate students from all backgrounds.|$|R

25|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of female {{circular}} migrants has increased rapidly. In {{the second half of}} the nineteenth century, South Africa's internal policies only permitted men to legally migrate to the city. This influx control was lifted in 1986, thus paving the way for women to begin migrating to urban areas. However, the change first affected permanent migration patterns, as female circular migration did not begin to increase substantially until over a decade later, mostly due to changing economic conditions. Overall, mobility in South Africa is high and continues to grow, as circular migration is carried out to look for work and raise children in areas with <b>better</b> <b>schools.</b>|$|E

Though the federal government's Model Cities Program spent $100 million on job training, health care, education, public safety, sanitation, housing, and other projects over a ten-year period, Harlem showed no improvement. The city began auctioning its enormous portfolio of Harlem properties to the public in 1985. This was intended to improve the community by placing property in the hands of people who would live in them and maintain them. In many cases, the city would even pay to completely renovate a property before selling it (by lottery) below market value.|$|E
25|$|Black {{flight is}} a term applied to the out-migration of African Americans from {{predominantly}} black or mixed inner-city areas in the United States to suburbs and outlying edge cities of newer home construction. While more {{attention has been paid}} to this since the 1990s, the movement of blacks to the suburbs has been underway for some time, with nine million people having migrated from 1960 to 2000. Their goals have been similar to those of the white middle class, whose out-migration was called white flight: newer housing, <b>better</b> <b>schools</b> for their children, and attractive environments. From 1990 to 2000, the percentage of African Americans who lived in the suburbs increased to a total of 39 percent, rising 5 percent in that decade. Most who moved to the suburbs after World War II were middle class.|$|E

25|$|Many {{people move}} to urban areas {{primarily}} because cities promise more jobs, <b>better</b> <b>schools</b> for poor's children, and diverse income opportunities than subsistence farming in rural areas. For example, in 1995, 95.8% of migrants to Surabaya, Indonesia reported that jobs were their primary motivation for {{moving to the}} city. However, some rural migrants may not find jobs immediately because of their lack of skills and the increasingly competitive job markets, which leads to their financial shortage. Many cities, on the other hand, do not provide enough low-cost housing for {{a large number of}} rural-urban migrant workers. Some rural–urban migrant workers cannot afford housing in cities and eventually settle down in only affordable slums. Further, rural migrants, mainly lured by higher incomes, continue to flood into cities. They thus expand the existing urban slums.|$|E
25|$|Under the Law on Nine-Year Compulsory Education, {{primary schools}} {{were to be}} tuition-free and {{reasonably}} located {{for the convenience of}} children attending them; students would attend primary schools in their neighborhoods or villages. Parents paid a small fee per term for books and other expenses such as transportation, food, and heating. Previously, fees were not considered a deterrent to attendance. Under the education reform, students from poor families received stipends, and state enterprises, institutions, and other sectors of society were encouraged to establish their own schools. A major concern was that scarce resources be conserved without causing enrollment to fall and without weakening of the <b>better</b> <b>schools.</b> In particular, local governments were told not to pursue middle-school education blindly while primary school education was still developing, or to wrest money, teaching staff, and materials from primary schools.|$|E
25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning.

I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations.

40|$|I {{examine how}} student {{allocation}} rules impact achievement of students of different ability and socioeconomic background. When the assignment rule shifts from exam to district based, a model illustrates that income relative to ability becomes a stronger predictor {{of student achievement}} and higher income households sort towards the <b>better</b> <b>school</b> districts. Using evidence from South Korea, I find {{that the impact of}} father’s education, relative to one’s middle school grade, on college entrance exam score increases twofold under district assignment.

[...] She supported {{a variety of}} causes including the improvement of conditions for children and orphans, hygiene and licensing regulations for beauticians, care facilities for the elderly, <b>better</b> <b>schools,</b> and controlling government waste. Aiken served as Secretary of the Save the Children organization {{and was a member}} of its executive board up to her death. She was also involved in the birth control movement alongside other reformers like Amy Bailey and May Farquharson. She believed that until women could plan the size of their own families, they {{would not be able to}} improve the economic, educational, or moral status of the black community as they would be unable to devote quality support to large numbers of children. She joined the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU) and though the organization largely excluded women, she pressed for social and economic improvements for women. Aiken also helped establish a trade union for seamstresses, co-founded the Housecraft Training Center and was the only woman to serve on the Trade Unions Council.|$|E
