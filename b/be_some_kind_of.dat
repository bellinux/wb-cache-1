25|$|The World Championship {{match of}} 1978 {{was held in}} Baguio, Philippines. There was {{enormous}} controversy off the board, ranging from X-raying of chairs, protests about the flags used on the board, hypnotism complaints and the mirror glasses used by Korchnoi. When Karpov's team sent him a bilberry yogurt during a game without any request for one by Karpov, the Korchnoi team protested, claiming it could <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> code (such as whether Korchnoi was dead equal or slightly advantageous).

25|$|The SSRIs are {{the first}} rationally {{designed}} class of psychotropic medications. The strategy behind rational drug design {{is to develop a}} new drug that is capable of affecting a specific biological target, or in this case a special neural site of action (uptake pumps, receptors), while trying to avoid effects on other site of actions. The goal in such development is to produce pharmacological agents that are more efficacious, safer and better tolerated than older medications. An initial success was achieved when medicinal chemists set out in search of the ideal SSRI with the chemical synthesis of zimelidine (figure 1) from the antihistamine drug brompheniramine, which exhibited selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake with minimal inhibition of norepinephrine (NE) re-uptake. Most importantly, zimelidine did not come with the adverse effect profile as the TCAs and therefore it became the template for the second generation SSRIs. Zimelidine was the first SSRI to be marketed, but several cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome were {{associated with the use of}} the drug which led to withdrawal from the market in 1983. Subsequently, several non-tricyclic SSRIs were discovered and marketed. Fluoxetine, which was FDA approved in 1987 and is usually thought to be the first SSRI to be marketed, paved the way for the next generation of SSRIs and was thought to <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> prototype. Introduction of fluoxetine to the market is hailed as a miracle drug for the treatment of depression because it had fewer adverse effects, simpler dosing strategies and greater margin of safety when overdoses were consumed and thus it had better adherence, compared to the older antidepressants (TCAs and MAOIs). Since then the number of drugs in the SSRI class has become bigger and they are now six (fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluvoxamine), as demonstrated in table 1.|$|E

Harrison and Boyd were married in January 1966, having met two years before on the set of the Beatles' film A Hard Day's Night, but by 1968, his dedication to meditation and Eastern mysticism had begun to divide the couple. Boyd writes of an associated issue at this time: [...] "And there were other women... George was fascinated by the god Krishna who was always surrounded by young maidens. He came back from India [...] wanting to <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Krishna figure, a spiritual being with lots of concubines. He actually said so." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{equitable}} tracing to be valid, {{several things}} must be demonstrated. First, the equitable title must exist; {{it can be}} brought into existence by the courts, such as in Constructive trusts. Secondly, there must <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> fiduciary relationship between the claimant and the defendant. If the property was transferred through breach of trust, {{it will not be}} necessary to establish such a relationship, because it already exists. In addition, property transferred through breach of trust may be traced to any third party (other than a purchaser in good faith), even if they did not previously have a fiduciary relationship with the claimant. Historically, the courts have been willing to be [...] "generous in finding that the necessary fiduciary relationship existed", even {{going so far as to}} recognise relationships that did not exist at the time of the transfer.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Several reviews wrote positively of {{the ensemble}} and character acting.

[...] CliqueClack wrote positively of the episode, praising the ensemble acting, and wrote, [...] "Overall, another solid ensemble episode. Way to go, The Office!" [...] Many other reviews compared the episode, either positively or negatively, to previous episodes. Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave gave the episode an 8/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I'd {{say it was the}} strongest of the six episodes so far this season ... 'Doomsday' delivered that classic, Office formula where everything just works – and it feels so right." [...] Joseph Kratzer from WhatCulture awarded the episode 3-and-a-half stars out of five and compared it to the season's previous episodes, writing, [...] "For a minute there I thought season eight of The Office was going to <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> subpar shut-out, but thankfully 'Doomsday' has lifted the series out of the rut it's been in ...

500|$|The track's lyrics, {{structured}} in verse–chorus form and written in second person narrative, predominantly feature a sarcastic tone. They {{were inspired by}} Williams' decision to move from Nashville to Los Angeles. She considered this idea after feeling overwhelmed by the repercussion, in Nashville, of Josh and Zac Farro's departure from Paramore. Williams said, [...] "I took off for L.A. {{as if it was}} going to <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> paradise or saving grace. I got there and realized that my problems were following me. Okay, so I was having a bad six months? Get over it. [...] " [...] The song was penned as a message regarding her behavior, in order for her to cope with her decision. She stated, [...] "No one else was saying that to me, so I had to say it to myself." [...] musicOMH's Thomas Ingham interpreted its lyrics as focusing on a [...] "serious 'all alone in the world'" [...] theme, while Corvallis Gazette-Timess journalist called them [...] "blunt" [...] and wrote that they discuss [...] "growing up". The writer also believed that its theme would make the song a prominent track at graduation ceremonies. Atilano viewed a contrast between the song's melody and lyrical content. However, he noted that its [...] "sunny" [...] sonority made it [...] "pleasant" [...] to hear.|$|E
