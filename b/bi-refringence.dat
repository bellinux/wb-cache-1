40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} {{utilization}} of induced <b>bi-refringence</b> {{sensitivity to temperature}} field in birefringent optical fibers. The propagating optical wave and optical fibers are described by means of coherency and Jones matrices, which are decomposed into unitary matrix and spin matrices. The development of polarization caused by temperature field is interpreted on the Poincaré sphere by means of MATLAB ® environment. The temperature sensi-tivity of Panda and bow-tie fiber has been measured for circular polarization excitation. Curves of intensity fluc-tuation caused by the temperature dependence are pre-sented.

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{asymmetric}} coherent scattering process (caused by initial atomic wave-packet splitting in the momentum space) taking place at the large detuning and adiabatic course of interaction for an effective two-state system interacting with a standing wave of laser radiation is discussed. We show that the same form of initial wave-packet splitting may lead to different, in general, diffraction patterns for opposite, adiabatic and resonant, regimes of the standing-wave scattering. We show that the scattering of the Gaussian wave packet in the adiabatic case presents refraction (a limiting form of the asymmetric scattering) {{in contrast to the}} <b>bi-refringence</b> (the limiting case of the high-order narrowed scattering) occurring in the resonant scattering...|$|E
40|$|As {{intermediates}} {{between the}} molecular and the solid states, inorganic nanoparticles 1, 2 combine chemical accessibility in solution with physical {{properties of the}} bulk phase. They are thus ideal elements {{for the construction of}} nanostructured materials and devices with adjustable physical and chemical properties. As an example for this building principle, we present here the synthesis of nanostructured particle aggregates by covalent linkage of soluble (Bu 4 N) x[H 1 -xCa 2 Nb 3 O 10] nanosheets 3 (from a layered perovskite) and superparamagnetic Fe 3 O 4 spheres. 4 Due to optical anisotropy of the sheets and the superparamagnetism of the magnetite particles, the nanoparticle aggregates exhibit magnetically controllable <b>bi-refringence</b> and light-scattering properties in solution, which make the composite interesting for magnetooptical sensing, display, and data storage applications.

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} how causality and micro-causality are realised in QED in curved spacetime. The photon propagator {{is found to}} exhibit novel non-analytic behaviour due to vacuum polarization, which invalidates the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relation and {{calls into question the}} validity of micro-causality in curved spacetime. This non-analyticity is ultimately related to the generic focusing nature of congruences of geodesics in curved spacetime, as implied by the null energy condition, and the existence of conjugate points. These results arise from a calculation of the complete non-perturbative frequency dependence of the vacuum polarization tensor in QED, using novel world-line path integral methods together with the Penrose planewave limit of spacetime in the neighbourhood of a null geodesic. The refractive index of curved spacetime is shown to exhibit superluminal phase velocities, dispersion, absorption (due to γ → e + e −) and <b>bi-refringence,</b> but we demonstrate that the wavefront velocity (the high-frequency limit of the phase velocity) is indeed c, thereby guaranteeing that causality itself is respected. – 1 – 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{show that}} QED in curved spacetime violates micro-causality, i. e. commutators of fields at spacelike separations do not vanish but exhibit a {{characteristic}} exponential fall-off over a length scale √ R/m 2, where R {{is a typical}} curvature and m is the electron mass. The violation of micro-causality is ultimately related to the generic focusing nature of congruences of geodesics in curved spacetime, as implied by the null energy condition, {{and the existence of}} conjugate points.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel application of support vec-tor machines and multiscale texture and color invariants {{to a problem}} in biological oceanography: the identifica-tion of 6 species of bivalve larvae. Our data consists of polarized color images of scallop and other bivalve larvae (between 2 and 17 days old) collected from the ocean by a shipboard optical imaging system of our design. Lar-vae of scallops, clams, and oysters are small (100 microns) with few distinguishing features when observed under stan-dard light microscopy. However, the use of polarized light with a full wave retardation plate produces a vivid color, <b>bi-refringence</b> pattern. The patterns display very subtle dif-ferences between species, often not discernable to human observers. We show that a soft-margin support vector ma-chine with Gaussian RBF kernel is a good discriminator on a feature set extracted from Gabor wavelet transforms and color distribution angles of each image. By constraining the Gabor center frequencies to be low, the resulting system can attain classification accuracy in excess of 90 % for ver-tically oriented images, and in excess of 80 % for randomly oriented images. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{carefully}} distinguish the notion of <b>bi-refringence</b> (a polarization-dependent doubling in photon propagation speeds) from that of bi-metricity (where the two photon polarizations ``see'' two distinct metrics). We emphasise that these notions are logically distinct, though there are special symmetries in ordinary (3 + 1) -dimensional nonlinear electrodynamics which imply the stronger condition of bi-metricity. To illustrate this phenomenon we investigate a generalized version of (3 + 1) -dimensional nonlinear electrodynamics, which permits the inclusion of arbitrary inhomogeneities and background fields. [For example dielectrics (a la Gordon), conductors (a la Casimir), and gravitational fields (a la Landau [...] Lifshitz). ] It is easy {{to demonstrate that the}} generalized theory is bi-refringent: In (3 + 1) dimensions the Fresnel equation, the relationship between frequency and wavenumber, is always quartic. It is somewhat harder to show that in some cases (eg, ordinary nonlinear electrodynamics) the quartic factorizes into two quadratics thus providing a bi-metric theory. Sometimes the quartic is a perfect square, implying a single unique effective metric. We investigate the generality of this factorization process.

40|$|Although {{much has}} been written about the origins and {{transmission}} of heart sounds and murmurs, little is known regarding the gen-eration of vibrations by disturbances of flow in liquids or the mechanisms by which vibra-tions in flowing liquids are coupled into sur-rounding distensible walls. Eddy formation and turbulence are generalry regarded as the sources of cardiovascular sounds. 1 The possi-ble relationships between the disturbed flow and the walls or other surrounding boundaries have been described by Bondi, 2 Rodbard, 3 Dawes et al. 4 and McKusick. 5 The importance of periodic wakes in sound production has been stressed by Brans. 6 The necessity of combining fluid and solid mechanics with acoustics is emphasized in "Wiskind and Tal-bot's discussion of cardiovascular sound pro-duction in physical terms. 7 Most information on the mechanisms of sound production is based more on theoretical considerations than on direct observations, and most studies lack a description of the flow pattern. Dye streamers effectively indi-cate streamline flow patterns, but are quickly mixed by the types of turbulence which may produce sounds. In this study streaming <b>bi-refringence</b> has been used for flow visualiza-tion. Flow patterns in all portions of a flow channel can be observed continuously when white Hector bentonite is used as the optically active medium. 8 In an application of this technique, the vibration frequencies from flow patterns in the liquid have been analyzed and compared with vibration frequencies in the adjacent distensible walls of the flow channel...|$|E
40|$|Background:Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) and scanning laser polarimetry with variable corneal com-pensation (GDx) {{are similar}} yet {{provide information on}} different aspects of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) struc-ture (thickness values similar to histology for OCT vs <b>bi-refringence</b> of microtubules for GDx). Objectives: To compare the ability of OCT and GDx to distinguish eyes of patientswithmultiple sclerosis (MS) from eyes of disease-free controls and thus identify RNFL abnormalities. We also sought to examine the capacity of these techniques to distinguish MS eyes from those without a history of optic neuritis and to correlate with visual function. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Academic tertiary care MS center. Participants: Eighty patients with MS (155 eyes) and 43 disease-free controls (85 eyes) underwent both OCT and GDx imaging using protocols that measure RNFL thickness. Main Outcome Measures: Areas under the curve (AUC), adjusted for within-patient, intereye correla-tions, were {{used to compare the}} abilities of OCT andGDx temporal-superior-nasal-inferior-temporal average RNFL thicknesses to discriminate betweenMS and control eyes and to distinguish MS eyes with a history of optic neu-ritis. Visual function was evaluated using low-contrast letter acuity and high-contrast visual acuity. Results: Average peripapillary RNFL thickness (360 ° around the optic disc) was reduced in patients with MS compared with controls for both methods. Age-adjusted AUC did not differ between OCT (0. 80; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 72 - 0. 88) and GDx (0. 78; 95 % CI, 0. 68 - 0. 86; P=. 38).
