In this research, sheet hydroforming process (SHF) was adopted to improve the formability of Ti/Al clad metal sheets and SUS 304 metal sheets used in computer, communication, and consumer product housings. Both finite element simulation and experimental verification were carried out to investigate the deformation of blanks. Several significant process parameters, such as holding force, friction, counter pressure history, and <b>blank</b> <b>dimensions,</b> were discussed for improv-ing the formability of the two metal sheets. In SHF simulation, a virtual film technique was proposed to realistically approach the hydraulic loading condition during SHF.

40|$|Ring rolling is an {{advanced}} plastic forming technique {{which is used}} to manufacture precise seamless rings. Rolling ratio is regarded as a decisive parameter for the ring rolling process because it decides the <b>blank</b> <b>dimension,</b> reflects the ring deformation degree and influ-ences the forming results.

The relationships between rolling ratio and <b>blank</b> <b>dimension,</b> rolling ratio and ring deformation degree are theoretically studied and a theoretical value range of rolling ratio is proposed.

40|$|Pallets are {{the single}} largest {{consumer}} of hardwood lumber in the United States. While the pallet industry has effectively adopted widespread pallet recycling, many pallets still go into landfills {{with little or no}} value gained from their material. Recovered pallet lumber has been proposed as a potential source of material for value added wood products. This study sought preliminary data on issues pertinent to the development of pallet parts as a source of raw material for value added products, with a focus on oak strip flooring. Issues examined included pallet disassembly efficiency, characteristics of recovered boards, and yield of blanks compatible with commercial flooring production. Disassembly of pallets was affected by pallet design. Overall 81 % of the deckboards from all pallet designs were recovered, along with 70 % of stringers. Oak boards useable in strip flooring represented 21 % of the recovered boards studied. Proper board stacking was found to maintain a uniform (MC) which would reduce drying defects and complications.

Highly carbonaceous wire {{was selected as the}} subject of studies, since it is the claimed form of metal wire production and the formation of ultrafinegrain structure in {{it is one of the}} directions of improving its performance properties. The essence of developed approach concludes the simultaneous imposition on continuously moving wire the dilitational strain wire drawing, the bending strain in transit through system of rollers and twisting strain. The claim for invention is given to the developed method, priority information is obtained. The results of conducted metallographic investigations showed that such deformation action combination on wire made of high-carbon steel 75 leads to crushing of its separate structural components, which size becomes less than 1000 nm, so it makes possible to classify the obtained structure as ultrafine-grain. As a result conducting mechanical tests it is established that the simultaneous action on high-carbon steel of dilitational strains and twisting leads to an increase of wire strength and plastic properties.

40|$|Hot {{stamping}} {{has been}} widely studied and increasingly applied in the automotive industry. This process is characterized by its ability to stamp high strength steels, yielding products with high mechanical strength, thus reducing the weight of stamped components and therefore the vehicles weight. It also demands less energy because steel sheets can be heated by induction, more efficient than electric furnaces. With controlled thinning, {{it is possible to}} manufacture thinner stamped parts with high mechanical strength, therefore it is necessary to know the formability limits to prevent failure and achieve the largest possible thickness reduction. In this work the hot formability of DIN 27 MnCrB 5 steel sheets 4 mm thick, under thinning conditibns was evaluated by numerical simulation with the finite element (FEM) software Forge 2008. Tensile tests were carried out at 500, 600, 700, and 800 degrees C and with strain rates from 0. 1 to 4 s(- 1). With the results of tensile tests, it was possible to calculate Hensel-Spittel coefficients to model the steel sheet and simulate the hot Nakazima test to evaluate the highest dome which could be formed without failure risks caused by sheet thinning. Simulation results obtained with specimens 200 mm long and 125, 150 or 200 mm wide that were stamped at 930 degrees C, showed the radial position and dome height associated to plastic instability as well provided the thickness distribution along the specimen. The numerical results were compared to experimental tests and showed a good agreement in terms of failure initiation and localization. As a result, a new numerical and experimental strategy was elaborated to define the hot formability based on the plastic instability and necking localization as a function of stamping temperature and <b>blank</b> <b>dimensions.</b> This strategy proved to be useful to define the safe formability region and therefore the larger thickness reduction that can be done during hot stamping to reduce vehicular components weight and to avoid cracks and failures usually observed in components like clutch covers.

40|$|Abstract: Cold ring rolling {{is a kind}} of {{advanced}} manufacturing technology. During rolling process the ring may be collapsed or deformed unexpectedly under the pressure of guide roll because the stiffness condition is not met. The force of guide roll to ring was obtained by analyzing the forces to ring. The stiffness condition expressions of ring during rolling were shown after constructing the mechanical model. According to the expressions, the effects of several parameters on the stiffness condition were discussed and analyzed in detail, such as position angle of guide roll, friction coefficient and feed rate, etc, which revealed essential reasons of some cases occurring in cold ring rolling. Then the ring <b>blank</b> <b>dimension</b> was deduced based on the ring stiffness condition. The <b>dimensions</b> of ring <b>blank</b> should meet a relationship to ensure the ring stiffness condition to be satisfied during rolling, which can conduct the practical manufacturing effectively. Finally the analysis and effect laws were proved by finite element simulation experiments. The researches could be helpful to control parameter in cold ring rolling effectively for high quality products...|$|R
40|$|The work in {{this paper}} {{presents}} the effect of material and <b>blank</b> <b>dimension</b> on the dimensions of external rolled threads. This paper will be helpful for the auto industry, {{one of the largest}} fasteners markets, that typically consumes between 2800 to 3100 fasteners in the assembly of an average family vehicle. Externally threaded fasteners comprise the bulk of fasteners used in these applications with over 90 % of being produced by thread rolling. The thread rolling process is now widely acknowledged as the fastest and most efficient method of producing accurate external threads, with surface finish and mechanical properties. The typical production rates are around one piece per second. In order to ensure a perfect thread rolling process, it is important for blank of work piece to be properly pre-machined. The size of the blank is dependent on material, surface finish, type of threads etc. This paper describes the effect of <b>blank</b> material and <b>dimensions</b> on nominal diameter of external rolled threads. The work has been carried out at M/s Gayatri Auto Industries on Master Reciprocating Dies Thread Rolling Machine using HSS die. Mild Steel (C 15), EN- 8 (C 40), and EN- 47 (Spring Steel) materials have been taken as blank material for the analysis to produce M 8 x 1. 25 6 g threads. The result indicates that the variation on surface roughness, carbon percentage and <b>dimension</b> of <b>blank</b> affects significantly the nominal diameter and PCD of threads.

His true plan is eventually revealed - that the quest was largely to distract Yugo so he could regain his power, steal back the Eliacube and then absorb the Wakfu of the planet to power his ship so he can continue to explore the Krozmos (the process would destroy the planet). While originally quiet, friendly and softspoken his personality changes drastically when he fuses with the Eliacube becoming cruel, sadistic, maniacal and manipulative.

40|$|Thermoforming {{simulations}} are {{an essential}} part in engineering design of components made of Continuous Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) with thermoplastic matrix known as Organic Sheets (OS). Through the simulations, the post-deformed fiber orientation can be calculated, which {{is essential for the}} determination of the mechanical properties of the component. Furthermore, draping problems can be detected, which may be corrected by adjusting the geometry of the tools or reinforcing some sections of the component. This thermoforming simulation would help to avoid unexpected failure of thermoformed components. The challenge of the thesis is the implementation of a suitable material model using Finite Element Software (FES). ABAQUS {{is one of the leading}} software programs in non-linear simulations, which has an open architecture that allows a scientific study of complex material models. Finished material models for OS are not stored in the program. However, these material models can be incorporated through the ABAQUS fabric material behavior, using either the test data based fabric or a VFABRIC subroutine. The aim of this thesis is modeling the thermoforming Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of OS using ABAQUS. Therefore, the following objectives are outlined. The first objective is the definition of the boundary condition and the deformation mechanisms that are displayed in the thermoforming simulation. The second objective is to implement a preliminary thermoforming process in ABAQUS, modeling the die, the stamp, the holder as analytical rigid components, and modeling the blank as a flat surface made of a “Dummy Material” such as Aluminum. The third objective is to do a deep research of the different possibilities of defining a material model in ABAQUS, and the necessary software requirements to run the thermoforming simulation with user defined material models. The fourth objective is to implement a macro-scale material model for OS in ABAQUS. Probably, shear force dependence against shear angle of the material angle can be mapped. Further post-processing operations unknown for now are done, such as the possibility of evaluating the shear angle, the fiber orientations and any component folds. The fifth and last objective is to document all the research done and create a tutorial guide that would help future researchers to refine de model by mapping more deformation mechanisms or more adjusted material models. A sensibility analysis to capture the influence of the geometry tools (holder dimensions, <b>blank</b> <b>dimensions),</b> fabric material test data (uniaxial tensile tests and picture frame tests) and boundary conditions (punch speed, holder load, friction coefficient) with shear angles is performed...|$|E

The price of an optical glass <b>blank</b> of given <b>dimensions</b> can vary by a factor of fifty or more, depending on the size, glass type, index homogeneity quality, and availability, with BK7 usually being the cheapest. Costs for larger and/or thicker optical blanks of a given material, above 100-150 mm, usually increase faster than the physical volume due to increased blank annealing time required to achieve acceptable index homogeneity and internal stress birefringence levels throughout the blank volume. Availability of glass blanks is driven by how frequently a particular glass type is made by a given manufacturer, and can seriously affect manufacturing cost and schedule.|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{improvements}} in technology of electrohydraulic impact forming (EHF) via investigation of stability of high-voltage underwater discharges and pressure fields they generate along surface of a sheet blank. The experimental research is held with use of conical discharge chamber equipped with one pair of electrodes. Measurements of pressure fields along round flat area are based on application of multi-point membrane pressure gauge (MPG). The tests conditions include wide range of spark gaps with four levels of charge voltage and energy. The investigation results showed strong influence of geometric parameters of discharge work volume and electric parameters of discharge circuit on repeatability of pressure fields. The spark gap value should be in severe correlation with distance to a sheet <b>blank</b> and <b>dimensions</b> of a loaded area. Parameter “normalised spark gap” is proposed for determination of geometric characteristics of discharge volume. The results confirm the validity of charge voltage-to-spark gap ratio of 1 kV/mm recommended for approximate setting the gap {{in order to ensure}} high pressure generation. This ratio is also good for repeatability of pressure fields and can be also expended.

The aim of the work was to investigate and recognize the factors affecting the quality of heat sealing and the leak resistance (tightness) of press-formed, polymer-coated paperboard trays heatsealed with a multi-layer polymer based lidding film. One target was to achieve a solution {{that can be used}} in food packaging using modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). The main challenge in acquiring adequate tightness properties for the use of MAP is creases in the sealing area of the paperboard trays which can act as capillary tubes and prevent leak-proof sealing. Several experiments were made to investigate the effect of different factors and process parameters in the forming and sealing processes. Also different methods of analysis, such as microscopic analysis and 3 D-profilometry were used to investigate the structure of the creases in the sealing area, and to analyse the surface characteristics of the tray flange of the formed trays to define quality that can be sealed with satisfactory tightness for the use of MAP. The main factors and parameters that had an effect on the result of leak-proof sealing and must be adjusted accordingly were the tray geometry and <b>dimensions,</b> <b>blank</b> holding force in press forming, surface roughness of the sealing area, the geometry and depth of the creases, and the sealing pressure.
