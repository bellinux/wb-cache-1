5000|$|The first {{recorded}} abyssal whale fall {{was discovered by}} Navy <b>bathyscaph</b> pilots LT Ken Hanson, Master Chief George Ellis and LT Tom Vetter diving in <b>bathyscaph</b> Trieste II (DSV-1) on 19 February 1977 (at [...] ). The skeleton of the carcass, which was completely devoid of organic tissue, remained intact and collapsed flat on the seafloor. The submersible recovered a jawbone and phalanges.

50|$|Soviet clone of this {{radio is}} called Saratov, {{named after the}} city where it was manufactured. While being similar externally, it is fully {{different}} internally. It is a nine-transistor TRF receiver with transformerless audio amplifier, while the prototype is a six-transistor superheterodyne, and its audio amplifier uses transformers. The clone has no chain, but has metal ring between ball halves instead. A later clone, LW superheterodyne with transformerless audio amplifier by the same manufacturer is called Batiskaf (means <b>bathyscaph),</b> it has chain and dial and lacks metal ring between halves, like in original Panapet. Another later clone, similar to previous one, but without chain, was manufactured in Khmelnitsky, it has 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics logo on its dial.|$|E
