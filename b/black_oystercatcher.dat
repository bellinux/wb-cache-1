25|$|Seabirds {{spend most}} of their lives at sea and are adapted to ocean life. Some even sleep in the water, though they must all return to land to lay their eggs. Their diets consist mostly of small fish, squid, shellfish, and crustaceans. Species of seabirds on the Oregon Coast include the common murre, tufted puffin, marbled murrelet, the <b>black</b> <b>oystercatcher,</b> auklets, many {{varieties}} of cormorants, the western gull, and glaucous-winged gull. Many seabird species are endemic and found nowhere else.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. African <b>Black</b> <b>Oystercatchers</b> (Haematopus moquini) have a modal clutch size of two eggs but {{occasionally}} lay one or three eggs. It {{has been noted}} that an increase in frequency of larger threeand even four-egg clutches has occurred {{over the last few}} decades. By analysing extensive historical nest records dating back five decades I verified the occurrence of this increase in three-egg clutches over many of the sites within their breeding range. As African <b>Black</b> <b>Oystercatchers</b> are very territorial, co-operative polygyny was rejected as a sole cause (through observations). As eggs were found to be significantly similar (through intra-clutch egg shape comparisons) within clutches egg-dumping as a cause was also rejected. It was thus established that the increase in three-egg clutch frequency was indicating an increase in breeding effort. On further analysis of this increase, it was discovered that three-egg clutches offer no benefit to species fitness or breeding success as they do not result in an increased fledgling output to those of the smaller two-egg clutches. This is primarily due to inefficient incubation {{as a result of the}} extra egg, and the inability to maintain and feed a larger brood size. This study validates previous assertions that three-egg clutch frequency is increasing for African <b>Black</b> <b>Oystercatchers...</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>oystercatcher</b> is {{the only}} {{representative}} of the oystercatcher family (Haematopodidae) over most of its range, overlapping slightly with the American oystercatcher (H. palliatus) {{on the coast of}} Baja California. Within its range it is most commonly referred to as the <b>black</b> <b>oystercatcher,</b> although this name is also used locally for the blackish oystercatcher and the African oystercatcher. Its scientific name is derived by John James Audubon from that of his friend John Bachman.|$|E

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} at Cattle Pass, Washington between 13 - 18 August 2014. The first {{study was conducted}} to determine the relationship between tidal height and the haul-out abundance of Steller Sea Lions (Eumetopias jubatus) at the Whale Rocks of the San Juan Channel. There was a clear diurnal pattern of abundance during both of the days used for data analysis. The abundance was very low in the morning which may be a result of the nighttime/early morning foraging behavior characteristic of Steller Sea Lions. It was determined that this variation in haul-out abundance of Steller Sea Lions did not occur in response to changes in tidal height. The data also suggest that air temperature {{may play a role in}} determining the total abundance of Steller Sea Lions. The second study was done to understand how two unrelated bird species, Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) and <b>Black</b> <b>Oystercatchers</b> (Haematopus bachmani), compare and contrast in their use of the Cattle Pass rocky intertidal habitat post-breeding season. It was found that <b>Black</b> <b>Oystercatchers</b> spend most of their time loafing in the region while Harlequin Ducks spend most of their time swimming and foraging. These data suggest that <b>Black</b> <b>Oystercatchers</b> use the habitat primarily as a resting area between flock feedings while Harlequin Ducks use it primarily as a feeding ground during molting periods that cause them to be temporarily flightless...|$|R
50|$|The Semichi Islands are an {{important}} nesting area for red-faced cormorants and glaucous-winged gulls.

50|$|Eleven {{species of}} seabirds, one shorebird (the <b>black</b> <b>oystercatcher)</b> and two {{pinnipeds}} are documented to breed on Castle Rock. Castle Rock is the northernmost breeding colony of northern elephant seals, which like harbor seals breed on the island; California sea lions and Steller sea lions use the island as a haul-out {{but do not}} breed there.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>oystercatcher</b> is a {{territorial}} bird {{during the}} nesting season, defending a foraging and nesting area in one territory. Some pairs {{have been recorded}} staying together for many years. Nests are small bowls or depressions close to the shore in which small pebbles and shell fragments are tossed in with a sideward or backward flick of the bill.|$|E
50|$|The oystercatchers are a {{group of}} waders forming the family Haematopodidae, which has a single genus, Haematopus. They are found on coasts {{worldwide}} apart from the polar regions and some tropical regions of Africa and South East Asia. The exception to this is the Eurasian oystercatcher and the South Island oystercatcher, both of which breed inland, far inland in some cases. In the past {{there has been a}} great deal of confusion as to the species limits, with discrete populations of all <b>black</b> <b>oystercatchers</b> being afforded specific status but pied oystercatchers being considered one single species.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} sight records of {{altogether}} 3 <b>black</b> <b>oystercatchers</b> {{from the coast}} of Senegal, in 1970 (Jarry in Hockey 1987) and 1975 (Ziguinchor Region: de Ridder 1997), but these are very unlikely to refer to this species which was by all accounts a resident bird never recorded outside the Canaries archipelago on other occasions. Two fairly convincing records from Tenerife - apparently in July 1965 or 1968 at Puerto de la Cruz (Bannerman 1969), and in 1981 at El Médano (Kraft in Hockey 1987) -, on the other hand, could indicate that a small population managed to persist on uninhabited islets until the early 1980s, {{it is interesting to}} note that second-hand records from Tenerife also exists for the mid-19th century (Bannerman 1963). The Senegal records are nonetheless puzzling, as none of the <b>black</b> species of <b>oystercatcher</b> are known to occur even in the general area; melanism is known to occur occasionally in the Eurasian oystercatcher (Stresemann 1927) which winters in the region; possibly the Senegal birds were such specimens.|$|R
50|$|Mitlenatch Island Nature Provincial Park {{is home to}} {{the largest}} seabird colony in the Strait of Georgia. Glaucous-winged gulls, pelagic cormorants, pigeon guillemots, {{rhinoceros}} auklets and <b>black</b> <b>oystercatchers</b> also return to Mitlenatch each spring to breed. All sedentary marine life, including abalones, scallops and sea cucumbers are fully protected within this zone. Some of the largest garter snakes in BC reside here. These snakes are frequently encountered along trails and in beach and tide pool areas, where they feed on small fish such as sculpins and blennies. This park is a favourite haul out for harbour seals, northern and California sea lions. The sea lions are generally present from late autumn to mid-May. River otters, killer whales and harbour porpoises are often sighted offshore.|$|R
