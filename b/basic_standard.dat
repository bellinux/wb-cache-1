5|$|Hobgood et al. {{argue that}} one key {{component}} in equipping nations to develop emergency medical systems {{is to identify}} the aspects of training that are essential for health care providers. In their view, a standard curriculum is useful for identifying core issues, even if countries have very different needs and resources. To address this goal, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine developed a model curriculum in 2009. This initiative seeks to provide a minimum <b>basic</b> <b>standard</b> that can be tailored to {{the specific needs of}} the various nations implementing training in emergency medicine. It is targeted towards all medical students in order to produce a minimum competency in emergency care for all physicians, regardless of their specialty.|$|E

Test cricket was first played at the ground in November 1931, the first Test of the series between Australia and South Africa. In December 1960, Test cricket's first-ever Tied Test took place at the ground when Richie Benaud's Australian team tied with Frank Worrell's West Indian side. Queensland clinched its first-ever Sheffield Shield title with victory over South Australia in the final at the ground in March 1995.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{descriptive}} {{study was to investigate}} student attitudes towards <b>Basic</b> <b>Standards</b> testing and student preparation for <b>Basic</b> <b>Standards</b> testing. The persons in this study were 128 11 th grade students enrolled at North High School in the Minneapolis school district during the spring of 1999. Ten homerooms were selected for this study. Five 11 th grade homerooms were made up of students that passed the <b>Basic</b> <b>Standards</b> exam, and five homerooms were made up of 11 th grade students that had not passed the <b>Basic</b> <b>Standards</b> exam. The Class of 2000 will be the first class required to pass <b>Basic</b> <b>Standards</b> testing to receive their high school diploma. Results were utilized to understand the relationship between student’s belief that students should have to pass the <b>Basic</b> <b>Standards</b> exam to graduated from high school and passing the exam. Results indicated that more passing students believed students should have to pass the exam to graduate than non-passing students. Results were utilized to understand the relationship between students belief that requiring students to pass the <b>Basic</b> <b>Standards</b> exam makes graduation from high school more meaningful and passing the exam. Results indicated that there was no relationshi...|$|R

25|$|In 1988 several vendors, {{mostly from}} the Unix and {{database}} communities, formed the SQL Access Group (SAG) {{in an effort to}} produce a single <b>basic</b> <b>standard</b> for the SQL language. At the first meeting there was considerable debate over whether or not the effort should work solely on the SQL language itself, or attempt a wider standardization which included a dynamic SQL language-embedding system as well, what they called a Call Level Interface (CLI). While attending the meeting with an early draft of what was then still known as MS Data Access, Kyle Geiger of Microsoft invited Jeff Balboni and Larry Barnes of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to join the SQLC meetings as well. SQLC was a potential solution to the call for the CLI, which was being led by DEC.|$|E
25|$|To this day, the {{mastering}} of the Beethoven {{double bass}} symphonic parts {{are considered a}} <b>basic</b> <b>standard</b> for all orchestral double bass players. Dragonetti came back to Vienna for an extensive stay in 1808-1809. On that second trip he became friends with composer Simon Sechter, who would become the court organist in 1824, and professor of composition at the Vienna Conservatorium in 1851. He wrote piano accompaniments {{to some of his}} concert pieces, and they maintained a lifelong correspondence. Dragonetti was again in Vienna in 1813 and got to meet once more Beethoven, who had just written Wellington's Victory, to celebrate the victory of Wellington over the French armies of King Joseph Bonaparte at the Battle of Vitoria. The premiere of this work, as well as of Beethoven's seventh symphony was performed on 8 December 1813 in the University's Festsaal, with Dragonetti leading the double basses.|$|E

2500|$|The new Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music thus formed offered musical {{qualifications}} {{to external}} candidates {{from anywhere in}} the British Empire who could meet its rigorous standards. 1,141 candidates entered for the first examinations in 1890, despite the high entry fee of two guineas. The income helped both institutions to keep their own student fees at an affordable level, which enabled the College to make a full three-year course of study its <b>basic</b> <b>standard.</b> Because of the thorough training thus offered, the high standard of playing of the College's students quickly became known. Leading musicians willingly appeared with the College orchestra, including Joseph Joachim and Hans Richter. Manns, Eugène Ysaÿe and Bernard Shaw praised it strongly. The historian David Wright says of Grove's legacy: [...] "The founding of the RCM in 1883 clearly represents the major turning point for musical training in Britain. The new attitudes it espoused stemmed directly from the professionalizing ethos that modernized and transformed Victorian society." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2012, in {{a conference}} in Kyoto {{researchers}} said evidence gathered since July was falling into line with the <b>basic</b> <b>Standard</b> Model more than its alternatives, {{with a range of}} results for several interactions matching that theory's predictions. Physicist Matt Strassler highlighted [...] "considerable" [...] evidence that the new particle is not a pseudoscalar negative parity particle (consistent with this required finding for a Higgs boson), [...] "evaporation" [...] or lack of increased significance for previous hints of non-Standard Model findings, expected Standard Model interactions with W and Z bosons, absence of [...] "significant new implications" [...] for or against supersymmetry, and in general no significant deviations to date from the results expected of a Standard Model Higgs boson. However some kinds of extensions to the Standard Model would also show very similar results; so commentators noted that based on other particles that are still being understood long after their discovery, it may take years to be sure, and decades to fully understand the particle that has been found.|$|E
