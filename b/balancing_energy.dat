40|$|An {{important}} operational {{aspect of}} grid-connected large-scale wind turbines is the predictability of their network in-feed. Wind power producers acting in day-ahead markets {{are obliged to}} predict their production {{a certain amount of}} hours in advance. Devia-tions from the predicted in-feed are alleviated by the grid operator with <b>balancing</b> <b>energy</b> at relatively high costs, depending on the market policy. Thus, the value of the annual production of a wind power producer can be significantly reduced by the penalty costs for <b>balancing</b> <b>energy.</b> This paper investigates to what extent the accuracy of the network in-feed could be improved by combining a wind turbine with a storage device used for balancing the differences between forecasted and actual network in-feed.

It is found that Germany has much higher activated <b>balancing</b> <b>energy</b> volumes, imbalance prices and actual BRP cost levels than the Netherlands, but these differences are perhaps rather caused by <b>balancing</b> <b>energy</b> market design differences and differences in intermittent generation shares than by imbalance settlement design differences.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors present the {{potential}} cost-savings that may arise due to demand response from residential customers {{participating in the}} Amsterdam Power eXchange (APX) day-ahead auction and the Dutch <b>balancing</b> <b>energy</b> market which is organised by TenneT, the Dutch Transmission System Operator (TSO). For this purpose, a model for residential demand response is developed that utilises as input historical market data. Furthermore, the model synthesises a daily load profile based on load profiles of Dutch residential customers and simulated data to represent aggregate demands of domestic appliances and electric vehicles. The model is built around {{the concept of the}} aggregator, an envisioned legal entity, that contracts large amounts of residential customers and then coordinates them in real-time under different objectives (i. e. economic optimisation based on predicted day-ahead prices and the provision of <b>balancing</b> <b>energy).</b> Simulation results show that the potential economic benefits of residential demand response, on the Dutch electricity markets, is relatively low on a per household basis, but not negligible for the business case of the aggregator...|$|E

40|$|Many energy-aware routing {{protocols}} {{have been proposed}} for wireless sensor networks. Most of them are only energy savers and do not take care about <b>energy</b> <b>balancing.</b> The <b>energy</b> saver protocols try to decrease the energy consumption of the network as a whole; however the <b>energy</b> manager protocols <b>balance</b> the <b>energy</b> consumption in the network to avoid network partitioning.

40|$|The {{integration}} of the increasing share of fluctuating renewable energy sources into the energy system requires more options in flexibility. A promising attempt is the power-to-gas concept (PtG) which allows the production of hydrogen and synthetic natural gas (SNG) from electricity and the storage in caverns or existing gas storage facilities. However, an economic operation in Germany is not expected before 2030, when the amount of surplus energy, mainly generated in wind parks, will be sufficient. Currently, a hardly analyzed aspect is the potential commercialization of the flexible electrolysis as controllable load on the electricity balancing market. This offers opportunities to generate additional revenues and to obtain cheap electricity {{in the form of}} <b>balancing</b> <b>energy.</b> The present article has been designed to analyze this aspect and to examine the impact of a potential commercialization of <b>balancing</b> <b>energy</b> on the gas production costs within the PtG concept. At first, the current legal framework, the funding instruments of SNG and the differences between the notion "Speichergas" and Biogas will be outlined. An overview of the current balancing market will be given and the development of prices on the secondary balancing market will be evaluated as well as expected market trends will be presented. The following calculation of gas production costs, which result from applying an optimal proposal strategy on the secondary balancing market, is model-based and uses historical data. Three scenarios are defined and examined, and the impact of variable electricity prices is analyzed. The electricity balancing market is profitable and offers many opportunities for PtG plants. The results show a decrease of SNG production costs by up to 74 % to 46, 9 €/MWh. As for the hydrogen, the production costs amount to approximately 25, 8 € /MWh which equals a cost reduction of up to 81 % compared to conventional PtG plants without commercialization of <b>balancing</b> <b>energy...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two new <b>energy</b> <b>balanced</b> {{routing protocols}} for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs); Efficient and <b>Balanced</b> <b>Energy</b> consumption Technique (EBET) and Enhanced EBET (EEBET). The first proposed protocol avoids direct transmission over long distance to save sufficient {{amount of energy}} consumed in the routing process. The second protocol overcomes the deficiencies in both Balanced Transmission Mechanism (BTM) and EBET techniques. EBET selects relay node {{on the basis of}} optimal distance threshold which leads to network lifetime prolongation. The initial energy of each sensor node is divided into <b>energy</b> levels for <b>balanced</b> <b>energy</b> consumption. Selection of high energy level node within transmission range avoids long distance direct data transmission. The EEBET incorporates depth threshold to minimize the number of hops between source node and sink while eradicating backward data transmissions. The EBET technique <b>balances</b> <b>energy</b> consumption within successive ring sectors, while, EEBET <b>balances</b> <b>energy</b> consumption of the entire network. In EEBET, optimum number of energy levels are also calculated to further enhance the network lifetime. Effectiveness of the proposed schemes is validated through simulations where these are compared with two existing routing protocols in terms of network lifetime, transmission loss, and throughput. The simulations are conducted under different network radii and varied number of nodes...|$|R
