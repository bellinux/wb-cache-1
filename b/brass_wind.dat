Works performed included Réveil des oiseaux, Chronochromie (commissioned for the 1960 festival) and Couleurs de la cité céleste. The latter piece {{was the result of}} a commission for a composition for three trombones and three xylophones; Messiaen added to this more <b>brass,</b> <b>wind,</b> percussion and piano, and specified a xylophone, xylorimba and marimba rather than three xylophones. Another work of this period, Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum, was commissioned as a commemoration of the dead of the two World Wars and was performed first semi-privately in the Sainte-Chapelle, then publicly in Chartres Cathedral with Charles de Gaulle in the audience.|$|E

In addition, the column of air can be lengthened by engaging one or more valves, thus lowering the pitch. Double and triple tonguing are also possible.|$|E

50|$|The musical {{style of}} the game's soundtrack is orchestral, with a symphony of strings, <b>brass,</b> <b>winds,</b> percussion, and {{occasionally}} ethnic instruments when the game allows for it, covering a variety of genre and periods. Because the themes are based on traditional and medieval styles, the music development department rejects all music with synths, loops, drum kits, electric guitars, or any pop/rock instruments. Because Wesnoth has no budget and relies completely on volunteer composers, its soundtrack is entirely synthesized.|$|R

5000|$|The crew of Melton’s Development Department, led by Ferdinand Kleinschmidt and Andreas Gambs {{made the}} first {{prototype}} {{in the beginning of}} May 2006. This instrument had a bore of an E alto horn, so the smallest Alto horn mouthpiece was used for playing it. The tapering and bell size was from the Melton MW-F10 Flugelhorn. The instrument had an intense dark sound and great low register down to the lowest pedal tones {{but on the other hand}} it had a problematic high register, starting with the written middle C. Although the intention was to make a <b>brass</b> <b>wind</b> with a voluminous dark sound, there was still problems in the case of the first prototype - mostly caused by creating a soprano instrument with a timbre of an alto.|$|E
