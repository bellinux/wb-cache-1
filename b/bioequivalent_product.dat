40|$|FDA’s {{critical}} path initiative documents {{have focused on}} the challenges involved in the development of new drugs. Some of the focus areas identified apply equally to the production of generic drugs. However, there are scientific challenges unique to the development of generic drugs as well. In May 2007, FDA released a document “Critical Path Opportunities for Generic Drugs” that identified some of the specific challenges in the development of generic drugs. The key steps in generic product development are usually characterization of the reference product, design of a pharmaceutically equivalent and <b>bioequivalent</b> <b>product,</b> design of a consistent manufacturing process and conduct of the pivotal bioequivalence study. There are several areas of opportunity where scientific progress could accelerate the development and approval of generic products and expand the range of products for which generic versions are available, while maintaining high standards for quality, safety, and efficacy. These areas include the use of quality by design to develop bioequivalent products, more efficient bioequivalence methods for systemically acting drugs (expansion of BCS waivers, highly variable drugs), and development of new bioequivalence methods for locally acting drugs...|$|E
40|$|In {{their quest}} to gain early entry of new generic {{products}} into the market prior to patent expiration, one of the strategies pursued by generic drug product manufacturers is to incorporate different salts of an approved active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in a brand company's marketed dosage form and subject such dosage forms to bioequivalence assessment. These initiatives present challenges to regulatory authorities where the decision to approve <b>bioequivalent</b> <b>products</b> containing such pharmaceutical alternatives {{must be considered in}} the light of safety and efficacy, and more particularly, with respect to their substitutability. This article describes the various issues and contentions associated with the concept of pharmaceutical alternatives, specifically with respect to the uses of different salts and the implications for safety, efficacy and generic substitution. 1...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{resistance}} and antibiotic drug effectiveness {{can be related}} to administering generic products with a subtherapeutic dose or poor in vivo drug release. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether locally marketed amoxicillin tablets have the required chemical and physical attributes, including in vitro bioequivalence performance. Five generic products (T 1, T 2, T 3, T 4, and T 5) containing combination of amoxicillin trihydrate and potassium clavulanate as 1 g strength present in immediate release tablets were compared to the reference listed drug product Augmentin® (R) for weight variation, friability, resistance to crushing, and chemical content of amoxicillin. Difference (ƒ 1) and similarity (ƒ 2) factors were calculated to assess in vitro bioequivalence requirements. The tablets from different products have shown compliance with the pharmacopeial requirements of the performed tests. The measured resistance to crushing of tablets did not influence the dissolution time. Three generic products released more than 85 % of amoxicillin by the first 15 min as did the reference product and were considered as <b>bioequivalent</b> <b>products.</b> T 1 and T 4 had ƒ 1 values of 16. 5 % and 25. 4 % respectively and their ƒ 2 values were 44. 5 and 34. 6 respectively, indicating failure to meet in vitro bioequivalence requirements. Tablet formulations can play an important role in achieving bioequivalence. Independent investigations such as this study serve as an important tool to reveal possible inferior or noncompliant products that may find their way to the market...|$|R

40|$|Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) {{integration}} and modelling {{were used to}} predict dosage schedules for florfenicol for two pig pneumonia pathogens, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida. Pharmacokinetic data were pooled for two <b>bioequivalent</b> <b>products,</b> pioneer and generic formulations, administered intramuscularly to pigs at a dose rate of 15 mg/kg. Antibacterial potency was determined in vitro as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and Mutant Prevention Concentration in broth and pig serum, for six isolates of each organism. For both organisms and for both serum and broth MICs, average concentration:MIC ratios over 48 h were similar and exceeded 2. 5 : 1 and times greater than MIC exceeded 35 h. From in vitro time-kill curves, PK/PD modelling established serum breakpoint values for the index AUC 24 h/MIC for three levels of inhibition of growth, bacteriostasis and 3 and 4 log 10 reductions in bacterial count; means were 25. 7, 40. 2 and 47. 0 h, respectively, for P. multocida and 24. 6, 43. 8 and 58. 6 h for A. pleuropneumoniae. Using these PK and PD data, together with literature MIC distributions, doses for each pathogen were predicted for: (1) bacteriostatic and bactericidal levels of kill; (2) for 50 and 90 % target attainment rates (TAR); and (3) for single dosing and daily dosing at steady state. Monte Carlo simulations for 90 % TAR predicted single doses to achieve bacteriostatic and bactericidal actions over 48 h of 14. 4 and 22. 2 mg/kg (P. multocida) and 44. 7 and 86. 6 mg/kg (A. pleuropneumoniae). For daily doses at steady state, and 90 % TAR bacteriostatic and bactericidal actions, dosages of 6. 2 and 9. 6 mg/kg (P. multocida) and 18. 2 and 35. 2 mg/kg (A. pleuropneumoniae) were required. PK/PD {{integration and}} modelling approaches to dose determination indicate the possibility of tailoring dose {{to a range of}} end-points...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{adoption of}} pharmaceutical technologies across the major OECD markets during 1999 - 2008, {{a period that}} has witnessed substantial R&D productivity shortfalls and increasing supply-side pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. The advent {{of the financial crisis}} in 2008 has resulted in even more stringent pricing and reimbursement (P&R) regulations to contain costs and ensure value for money in pricing decisions. The central theoretical question addressed, therefore, is how price regulation affects cross-national adoption dynamics of pharmaceutical technologies. I address the impact of regulation on: i) innovative technologies, i. e. patent-protected new molecules that are central to dynamic efficiency, and ii) imitative generic technologies, i. e. lower-priced <b>bioequivalent</b> <b>products</b> that are central to static efficiency. The research in this thesis was motivated by the lack of theoretical framework or empirical evidence on the dynamics of international technology adoption in general and marked delay patterns in the adoption of pharmaceutical technologies observed in practice. It is important to understand the regulatory factors driving these delays given the profound implications of such delays on consumer and producer welfare as well as healthcare provider/payer budgets. The main hypothesis in this thesis is that price controls negatively affect adoption speed for new molecules and generics in markets that employ price controls as these controls reduce incentives to entry and result in knock-on effects in foreign markets because of linkages such as reference pricing and parallel trade. The empirical strategy adopts difference-in-difference and survival analysis using IMS data from 20 markets and controls for heterogeneity in firm and molecule characteristics. Overall findings indicate that adoption of pharmaceutical technologies is slower in price-controlled markets and that firms adapt their launch strategies to changes in pharmaceutical regulations. Expected market size is a highly significant driver of generic launch hazard, which highlights the importance of demand-side policies to promote generic use...|$|R

40|$|We study price {{competition}} between high-quality global products and low-quality local products in a developing country, i. e., China, Nearly all previous studies on pharmaceutical {{price competition}} focused on developed countries with bioequivalent generics. In China, local generic <b>products</b> are not <b>bioequivalent</b> and are deemed of lower quality, while global {{products in the}} same class are considered similar in quality and better substitutes. We hypothesize that local generic competition drives down local product price but not global product price. In addition, we hypothesize that therapeutic competition among similar global products lowers global product price. Our empirical results support both hypotheses. Number of local generic competitors has a significantly negative effect on local product price but no effect on global product price, while number of global therapeutic competitors has a significantly negative effect on global product price. Policy changes that encourage <b>bioequivalent</b> local <b>products</b> and accelerate global product approvals will enhance price competition in China.

The scientific literature in this field is very extensive {{and there is also}} a wealth of data available on the websites of various regulatory jurisdictions. Therefore, this review is limited to selected examples, cited to illustrate general principles. The areas considered are: (1) the relationship of dose to plasma concentration through the pharmacokinetic properties, area under plasma concentration-time curve, bioavailability, and clearance; (2) the critical dependence of drug pharmacokinetics and residue depletion on product formulation; (3) disease state and population pharmacokinetics; and (4) the requirement for residue depletion studies for generic products shown to be <b>bioequivalent</b> to pioneer <b>products...</b>|$|R
40|$|Nifedipine (NIF), a 1, 4 -dihydropyridine {{calcium channel}} antagonist, {{undergoes}} photo-degradation to dehydro-nifedipine (DNIF) upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light {{and to the}} nitroso analogue of dehydro-nifedipine (NDNIF) when exposed to sunlight or some kinds of artificial lights. NIF photo-degradation products do not contribute to clinical activity, thus prevention of photo-degradation of NIF formulations is very important. Large differences in photo-stability between <b>bioequivalent</b> NIF <b>products</b> could potentially result in the therapeutic failure of unstable preparations. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of microencapsulation on nifedipine photo-stability. Four different microspheres of nifedipine were prepared using ethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose plus titanium oxide, pectin and gelatin. Microspheres were exposed to fluorescent light and the content of NIF, DNIF and NDNIF for each product was measured using a specific and sensitive reversed phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method to determine the extent of photo-decomposition. In addition, photo-degradation of pure NIF powder was compared with acidic and buffer solution of NIF. Solution of NIF degraded in one day, while microencapsulation of NIF prevented the photo-degradation for up to six days against light exposure. Therefore, it may be concluded that present microencapsulation method without using other compounds such as opaque materials do not provide enough protection...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} goal of bioequivalence (BE) investigations has crucial {{importance and}} {{has been the subject}} of extensive discussions. BE studies are frequently considered to serve as procedures for sensitive discrimination. The BE investigation should be able to provide methods and conditions sensitively identifying relevant differences between drug products if such differences in fact exist. Alternatively, BE studies can be deemed as surrogates of clinical investigations assessing therapeutic equivalence. <b>Bioequivalent</b> drug <b>products</b> will be provided to patients for their benefits. Both points of view are valid since they represent two aspects of product performance. It has been argued that both should be equally sustained and applied. In practice, however, they collide when regulatory conditions and statements are developed. For instance, some regulators prefer to conduct BE studies following single drug administrations since these conditions are considered to provide the highest sensitivity of discrimination between pharmacokinetic profiles and thus, a product's in-vivo performance. Others suggest that, at least for modified-release products, BE investigations should be performed in the steady state since it represents clinical conditions. Preference for one point of view or the other pervades other regulatory statements including suggestions for subjects to be selected in studies and pharmacokinetic measures to be evaluated. An overview is provided on the disturbing inconsistency of statements within and between regulations. It is argued that harmonization would be highly desirable, and relevant recommendations are offered...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{pathways}} for {{the development}} and approval of <b>bioequivalent</b> inhaled <b>products</b> have been established for regulated markets, including the European Union (EU), {{and a number of}} orally inhaled products (OIPs) have been approved in the EU {{solely on the basis of}} in vitro and pharmacokinetic data. This review describes how these development pathways are structured and their implications for the treatment of airway diseases such as asthma. The EU guidance follows a stepwise approach that includes in vitro criteria as the first step. If all in vitro criteria are not met, the second step is based on pharmacokinetic evaluations, which include assessments of lung and systemic bioavailability. If all pharmacokinetic criteria are not met, the third step is based on clinical endpoint studies. In this review, the scientific rationale of the European Medicines Agency guidance {{for the development}} of bioequivalent OIPs is reviewed with the focus on the development of bioequivalent OIPs in the EU. Indeed, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the weight-of-evidence and stepwise approaches. The evidence indicates that the EU guidance is robust and, unlike clinical endpoint studies, the pharmacokinetic studies are far more sensitive to measure the minor differences, i. e. deposition and absorption rates, in drug delivery from the test and reference products and, thus, should be best suited for assessing bioequivalence. The acceptance range of the 90 % confidence intervals for pharmacokinetic bioequivalence (i. e. 80 - 125 % for both the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and maximum plasma concentration) represent appropriately conservative margins for ensuring equivalent safety and efficacy of the test and reference products...|$|R
40|$|Levothyroxine sodium {{is a drug}} with {{a narrow}} {{therapeutic}} index for which an individual patient must have his or her dose carefully titrated to achieve the necessary therapeutic effect. In addition, exogenous levothyroxine cannot be distinguished from the endogenously produced hormone. Since 2004, generic formulations have been approved for the most frequently prescribed brands of levothyroxine sodium. This review examines the methodology and statistical acceptance criteria and summarizes findings of a previously published relative bioavailability study that brings into question the use of standard criteria to assess bioequivalence of levothyroxine sodium. The key findings reviewed were the following: (1) {{in the absence of}} baseline correction for endogenous T 4 levels, products that differed by as much as 25 % to 33 % would be declared bioequivalent; (2) the use of baseline correction reduced the likelihood of declaring <b>products</b> <b>bioequivalent</b> when they actually differed by 25 % to 33 %; (3) even with baseline correction, products that differed by 12. 5 % would be declared bioequivalent; and (4) there was evidence of significant carryover from one dosing period to the next even with washout periods of up to 53 days. In conclusion, the current recommended methodology in the United States to assess bioequivalence for levothyroxine sodium products is inadequate to differentiate products that differ by 12. 5 %, a clinically relevant difference. Recommendations are made for modifications to the criteria that could improve the likelihood that products that differ by a clinically significant amount in their bioavailability would not be accepted as bioequivalent...|$|R
40|$|ERMAInternational audienceThe use of {{generics}} {{results in}} savings {{for the budget}} of the health insurance, and no player of health could question seriously the principle. The generic drug of a reference medicinal product defines itself as a drug having the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active ingredients, the same dosage form and the bioequivalence with this reference medicinal product was demonstrated by appropriate studies of bioavailability. It is the right to switch granted to the pharmacists in 1999 that is at the origin of the real development of these specialties on the French pharmaceutical market. Nevertheless, about 10 years later, it seems that the system in place does not offer all the necessary securities with regard to pharmacovigilance, notably for the products with narrow therapeutic margin. By strengthening and/or by completing the role played by the health care professionals and the public institutions concerned, it is highly possible to improve the robustness of the system. Also, the recent arrival in Europe of the biosimilars, similar molecules but not <b>bioequivalent</b> to biological <b>products,</b> cause an even more tricky specific situation than that of the generics because of their nature, of the difficulty to manufacture them, and of the risk of immunogenicity. If the substitution is not permitted in several European countries including France, the other issues can appear especially in case of interchangeability requiring also, the reinforcement of certain measures. The various aspects are described in this article with concrete proposals on how the current system can be made safer, both for the generics and the biosimilars...|$|R
