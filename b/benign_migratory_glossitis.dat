5000|$|Migratory {{stomatitis}} is {{a condition}} that involves the tongue and other oral mucosa. The common <b>migratory</b> <b>glossitis</b> (geographic tongue) affects the anterior {{two thirds of the}} dorsal and lateral tongue mucosa of 1% to 2.5% of the population, with one report of up to 12.7% of the population. The tongue is often fissured, especially. in elderly individuals. In the American population, a lower prevalence was reported among Mexican Americans (compared with Caucasians and African Americans) and cigarette smokers. When other oral mucosa, beside the dorsal and lateral tongue, are involved, the term migratory stomatitis (or ectopic geographic tongue) is preferred. In this condition, lesions infrequently involve also the ventral tongue and buccal or labial mucosa. They are rarely reported on the soft palate and floor of the mouth.|$|R
50|$|All {{sides of}} the tongue are assessed. To inspect the dorsal side (top) of the tongue, a patient sticks out their tongue. A healthy dorsal tongue is symmetrical, pink, moist, {{slightly}} rough from the papillae, possibly with a thin, whitish coating. The {{sides of the}} tongue are inspected with a gloved hand holding a piece of gauze. The tongue is moved side to side and inspected; it should be pink, moist, smooth and glistening. Assessment of the ventral (bottom) surface of the tongue is done by having the patient touch the tip of their tongue against the roof of their mouth. If healthy, it should have prominent veins and be pink, smooth, moist, glistening and free of lesions. The frenulum should be centered under the tongue. Abnormal findings includes marked redness, cyanosis or extreme pallor. Diseases include scrotal or fissured tongue, <b>migratory</b> <b>glossitis</b> (geographic tongue), atrophic glossitis, black hairy tongue, caviar lesions, carcinoma, macroglossia, candidiasis, aphthous ulcer and leukoplakia.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Geographic tongue or <b>migratory</b> <b>glossitis</b> is an {{inflammatory}} disorder with unknown etiology. Considering the accompanied burning pain, taste dysfunction, {{and lack of}} definite cure, {{it is important to}} treat this condition symptomatically. The objective of the current study was to compare the efficacy of a combination of 0. 05 % retinoic acid and 0. 1 % triamcinolone acetonide with that of triamcinolone acetonide alone for treatment of symptomatic geographic tongue. Materials and Methods: This randomized controlled double-blind clinical trial was performed on 28 patients with symptomatic geographic tongue, who were referred to two dental clinics. Participants were randomly divided into two groups and treated with triamcinolone alone or retinoic acid plus triamcinolone for 10 days. Patients were assessed for the level of pain, burning sensation and size of lesion at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the study. Participants were followed up for two months after cessation of treatment (at the end of each month). SPSS 11 was applied to compare the two therapeutic modalities. Results: Twenty-eight participants with a mean age of 40 years were evaluated including Seven (25 %) males and 21 (75 %) females. There was a positive family history of geographic tongue in 21 patients. Despite the diminished pain and burning sensation as well as smaller size of lesions following treatment (P 0. 05). No side effect was reported.   Conclusion: The combination of triamcinolone and retinoic acid was not more effective than triamcinolone alone for symptomatic treatment of geographic tongue. </div...|$|R

50|$|Geographic tongue, also termed <b>benign</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>glossitis,</b> is {{a common}} {{condition}} which usually affects the dorsal surface of the tongue. It is characterized by patches of depapillation and erythema bordered by a whitish peripheral zone. These patches give the tongue {{the appearance of a}} map, hence the name. Unlike glossitis due to nutritional deficiencies and anemia, the lesions of geographic tongue move around the tongue over time. This is because in geographic tongue, new areas of the tongue become involved with the condition whilst previously affected areas heal, giving the appearance of a moving lesion. The cause is unknown, and there is no curative treatment. Rarely are there any symptoms associated with the lesions, but occasionally a burning sensation may be present, which is exacerbated by eating hot, spicy or acidic foodstuffs. Some consider geographic tongue to be an early stage of fissured tongue, since the two conditions often occur in combination.|$|E

40|$|Background: Psoriasis is a multifactorial disease. Genetic and {{environmental}} factors, which determine the disease epidemiology and clinical spectrum, are heterogeneous in different populations. A few case-control studies {{from other countries}} have shown an association between psoriasis and <b>migratory</b> <b>glossitis</b> (MG). The characteristics of the association (e. g. relationship with gender, severity of psoriasis, early- versus late-onset psoriasis, etc.) have not been clearly defined. Aim: To investigate the association of psoriasis and MG by conducting a matched case-control study in India. Methods: The study was conducted on 600 patients with psoriasis and 800 age- and sex-matched controls. Patients were examined for oral lesions and psoriasis severity was assessed by overall severity index (OSI) and psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). We compared the proportions of patients and controls with oral lesions, proportions {{of male and female}} patients who had MG, psoriasis severity scores of patients with or without MG, and proportions of early- and late-onset psoriasis patients who had MG. Results: Significantly, more patients had oral lesions than controls (P= 0. 0013). There was a strong association between psoriasis and MG (P< 0. 0001). MG and fissured tongue (FT) occurring in the same patient were also strongly associated with psoriasis (P= 0. 0003). There was a weak association of psoriasis with FT (P= 0. 0456). Significantly, higher proportion of male patients had MG compared to female patients (P= 0. 0246). Patients with MG had more severe psoriasis compared to those without the tongue lesions (P< 0. 0001). Similar proportions of patients with type 1 and type 2 psoriasis had MG (P= 0. 7268). Conclusions: The results suggest that MG is a rare manifestation of psoriasis which occurs more commonly in male patients and in those with severe disease, and that it occurs with equal frequency in early- and late-onset psoriasis. It will be interesting to follow those patients who have MG, but not psoriasis, to see whether they develop psoriasis phenotype in future...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} {{in order to determine the}} prevalence of oral alterations among 200 infants aged 0 to 24 months (108 males and 92 females), who were seen at public pediatric dental clinics from Ponta Grossa - PR, Brazil. The infants were examined during routine appointments. The data were analyzed and the results revealed that 21. 00 % of the children had oral conditions, which were more frequent among children aged 0 to 3 months (26. 98 %). The most prevalent condition was the inclusion cyst (35. 71 %), followed by <b>benign</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>glossitis</b> (23. 81 %) and candidiasis (11. 90 %). The prevalence of inclusion cysts was higher among females (10. 87 %), and the <b>benign</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>glossitis</b> was more frequently seen in males (6. 48 %). No tumors were found. With regard to the management of the conditions, it was noticed that no treatment was required in 76. 19 % of the cases. These findings are in agreement with those reported in the literature, and it was concluded that most of the oral conditions in infants are benign and do not require any treatment.

40|$|Introduction: “Geographic tongue” or <b>benign</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>glossitis</b> is {{a tongue}} {{disorder}} which causes pain and dysfunction and its persistence leads to cancer phobia. Based on some reports, hormones (especially female sex hormones) {{are associated with}} geographic tongue development or exacerbation. Geographic tongue might be confused with lichen planus and candidiasis. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the association of the lesion with pregnancy and its changes during each trimester. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive, analytical and cross-sectional study, 451 eligible cases were selected. After clinical examination and completion of questionnaires, if geographic tongue was diagnosed, photographs were taken and compared between the three trimesters. Data was analyzed with chi-squared test and Pearson’s correlation coefficient at a confidence interval of 95 %. Results: The prevalence of geographic tongue in pregnant women was 36. 8 %. There were no significant relationships between the number of pregnancies, age and the frequency of the lesions. However, there was a significant relationship between the ectopic lesions and the fissured tongue (p value = 0. 001) and also between the gestational age and geographic tongue lesions (p value = 0. 043). The lesions were most prevalent in the second trimester, but in third trimester, prevalence of severs lesions decreased. Conclusions: Under the limitations of the present study, prevalence of geographic tongue in pregnant women was higher than previous reports in other communities. Severe lesions were more prevalent in the second trimester. Key words: <b>Benign</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>glossitis,</b> Hormones, Pregnancy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Our {{objective}} was to study tongue lesions and their significance in psoriatic patients. Methods The oral mucosa was examined in 200 psoriatic patients presenting to Razi Hospital in Tehran, Iran, and 200 matched controls. Results Fissured tongue (FT) and <b>benign</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>glossitis</b> (BMG) were the two most frequent findings. FT was seen more frequently in psoriatic patients (n = 66, 33 %) {{than the control group}} (n = 19, 9. 5 %) [odds ratio (OR) : 4. 69; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 2. 61 – 8. 52] (p-value FT was more frequent in pustular psoriasis (7 cases, 53. 8 %) than erythemato-squamous types (56 cases, 30. 4 %). On the other hand, the frequency of BMG increased with the severity of psoriasis in plaque-type psoriasis assessed by psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score. Conclusions Nonspecific tongue lesions are frequently observed in psoriasis. Further studies are recommended to substantiate the clinical significance of these seemingly nonspecific findings in suspected psoriatic cases. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Geographic {{tongue is}} a chronic, inflammatory, and immune-mediated oral lesion of unknown etiology. It is {{characterized}} by serpiginous white areas around the atrophic mucosa, which alternation between activity, remission and reactivation at various locations gave the names <b>benign</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>glossitis</b> and wandering rash of the tongue. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease with frequent cutaneous involvement and an immunogenetic basis of great importance in clinical practice. The association between geographic tongue and psoriasis has been demonstrated in various studies, based on observation of its fundamental lesions, microscopic similarity between the two conditions {{and the presence of}} a common genetic marker, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) HLA-C* 06. The difficulty however in accepting the diagnosis of geographic tongue as oral psoriasis is the fact that not all patients with geographic tongue present psoriasis. Some authors believe that the prevalence of geographic tongue would be much greater if psoriatic patients underwent thorough oral examination. This study aimed to develop a literature review performed between 1980 and 2014, in which consultation of theses, dissertations and selected scientific articles were conducted through search in Scielo and Bireme databases, from Medline and Lilacs sources, relating the common characteristics between geographic tongue and psoriasis. We observed that the frequency of oral lesions is relatively common, but to establish a correct diagnosis of oral psoriasis, immunohistochemical and genetic histopathological analyzes are necessary, thus highlighting the importance of oral examination in psoriatic patients and cutaneous examination in patients with geographic tongue...|$|E
40|$|Background Fissured tongue (FT) is a {{clinical}} condition manifested by numerous little furrows on the tongue's surface. Previously, the authors observed an association with HLA-Cx 06 in psoriasis (PS) and <b>benign</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>glossitis</b> (BMG); however, HLA-C was not surveyed in FT. Objective This {{study investigated the}} association between HLA alleles and FT. Methods Thirty-three FT bearers were studied, after evaluation of criteria for inclusion. These patients did not present PS, BMG or any other conditions associated with FT. the control group (CG) was composed of 561 individuals with HLA-A, 560 individuals with HLA-B, 168 individuals with HLA-C, 564 individuals with HLA-DRB 1 and 390 individuals with HLA-DQB 1. Samples from these individuals were processed to extract DNA. the HLA classes I and II were determined using the reverse line blot technique. the frequencies of HLA antigens found in patients were compared with the CG using Fisher's exact test. Results the comparison of the frequencies of HLA antigens found in the patient groups and in CG revealed no association {{with any of the}} alleles studied, except for HLA-A* 01, which exhibited a decreased frequency in patient groups. HLA-C* 06 was detected in 7. 57 % of FT patients and 10. 42 % of the CG (not significant). Conclusion the lack of association of FT with HLA-C* 06 reinforces the proposal that this disease does not have a common genetic factor in the triad of BMG, FT and PS.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{association}} between <b>benign</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>glossitis</b> (BMG) and psoriasis (PS) {{has been reported}} in the literature. ObjectiveThis study aimed to determinate the environmental factors related to BMG and PS and to investigate their interactions. MethodsThe study population included 129 patients with PS, 399 patients with BMG and a control group (CG) of 5472 individuals with neither PS nor BMG. the environmental factors evaluated in this study included alcohol and tobacco consumption and emotional stress. the Pearson's chi-squared test was used for analysing the association of the environmental factors with PS and BMG. ResultsThe prevalence of alcohol consumption in the PS group was significantly higher than that in the CG. Tobacco consumption had a weak negative association with the BMG group. With respect to the PS group, no statistically significant association was observed. Emotional stress was {{the most important factor in}} the two study groups. Emotional stress and alcohol use together presented a higher incidence in the study groups than in the CG. Emotional stress and tobacco consumption together had a three times higher incidence in the PS group than in the BMG group. the association of emotional stress, alcohol and tobacco consumption in the PS group was four times higher than that in the CG. LimitationsThis study was limited by the lack of the information about frequency, type and length time of use of tobacco and alcohol, and by difficult to measure stress thought self-report questionnaire. ConclusionThe interactions between PS and environmental factors differ from those between BMG and environmental factors. These differences among interactions may be responsible for different forms of manifestations of these diseases, considering being both the same disease.
