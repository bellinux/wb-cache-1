25|$|The {{orbits of}} the known {{irregular}} satellites are extremely diverse, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> patterns. Retrograde orbits are far more common (83%) than prograde orbits. No satellites are known with orbital inclinations higher than 55° (or smaller than 130° for retrograde satellites). In addition, some groupings can be identified, in which one large satellite shares a similar orbit with a few smaller ones.|$|E
25|$|The {{theme of}} the morna is varied, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> {{subjects}} that are approached with more frequency. Besides universal subjects like love, typically Cape Verdean subjects are talked about, such as departure abroad, the return, the saudade, love for the homeland and the sea. One of the great performers responsible for this thematic was the poet/composer Eugénio Tavares who introduced {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century the lyricism and the exploration of typical romanticism still used today.|$|E

25|$|Currently, {{there are}} few {{examples}} in the clad series that are valued as highly as the silver series <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> extraordinary dates or variations. The Deep Cameo versions of proofs from 1965 to 1971 and 1981 Type Two are highly valued because of their scarcity, high grade examples of quarters from certain years of the 1980s (such as 1981–1987) because of scarcity in high grades due to high circulation and in 1982 and 1983 no mint sets were produced making it harder to find mint state examples, and any coin from 1981–1994 graded in MS67 is worth upwards of $1000.|$|E

This {{consists}} of the School Custos (reception), Big School Room, Chapel and Library as well as Mathematics, English, Classics (Classical civilisation, Latin and Greek) and History classrooms. The Courts also contains School House. Geography, Geology, Art and Economics are contained in the Carrington Building, with DT workshops and classrooms nearby.

Drama is in the Drama School, The Sports Centre contains PE lessons {{as well as a}} 25-metre swimming pool, a fitness centre, a gymnasium and several physiotherapy suites. The Sport's Centre is open for public use, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> hours where it is exclusively for use by the pupils.|$|E
500|$|The aliens seen at {{the start}} of the episode were portrayed by children. Carter wrote {{specifically}} the part of Duane Barry with Steve Railsback in mind, saying [...] "I've resisted casting the marquee names only because it takes you out of the show; makes the show less believable. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> actors who just call out for the part." [...] Originally, Railsback character was named Duane Garry, but it was changed to Duane Barry after learning that a person within the Federal Bureau of Investigation had the same name. Carter has mentioned that he disliked the new name at first, but got used to it over time.|$|E

However, Hodson's career received praise from more senior politicians including the prime minister and the secretary of state for India.|$|R
500|$|There are {{two general}} types of homicide, murder and manslaughter. Murder {{requires}} an intention {{to kill or}} an intention to commit grievous bodily harm. If this intention is present <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> types of mitigating factors [...] loss of control, diminished responsibility, or pursuance of a suicide pact [...] then this is voluntary manslaughter. There {{are two types of}} involuntary manslaughter. Firstly, it may be [...] "constructive" [...] or [...] "unlawful act" [...] manslaugher, where a lesser but inherently criminal and dangerous act has caused the death. Alternatively, manslaughter may be caused by gross negligence, where the defendant has broken a duty of care over the victim, where that breach has led to the death, and is sufficiently gross as to warrant criminalisation.|$|E
500|$|While Glee also {{features}} Chenoweth's former Wicked co-star Idina Menzel as recurring character Shelby Corcoran, the producers {{declined to give}} the two scenes together, explaining that the series is story-driven, and as re-uniting the two on-screen did not work for storytelling purposes, it was deemed unnecessary. Of Chenoweth's future with Glee beyond [...] "Home", Falchuk commented that the producers want to [...] "have her around as much as possible", and although no plans have been solidified, she may return in the second season. He expanded: [...] " [...] you have talents like that, it's very hard to not want them back. The one advantage we have, I think, {{is that we have}} so many incredibly talented people in our … cast that … we don't need [...] as much. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> very special people that, of course, you'd always be interested in." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of [...] "insider trading". The first is the trading of a corporation's stock or other {{security}} by corporate insiders such as officers, key employees, directors, or holders of more than ten percent of the firm's shares. This is generally legal, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> reporting requirements.|$|E
6000|$|Was Tommy daft? Mr. Dishart did {{not know}} that his son possessed these books. He did not approve of story books, and when Mrs. Dishart gave them to Gavin on his {{birthday}} she--she had told him {{to keep them out of}} his father's sight. (Mr. and Mrs. Dishart were very fond of each other, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>certain</b> little matters that she thought it unnecessary to trouble him about.) ...|$|R

2500|$|Absolute {{right to}} {{property}}: The right {{of private property}} allows one to use, enjoy, and even destroy something owned, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> limitations imposed on the reach of this right, and jurisprudence establishes restrictions, based on the aforementioned Article 953. The justification {{of the right to}} destroy property is established in the following note found in Article 2.513: [...] " [...] But it must be recognized that with absolute right to property, comes the right to destroy property. Any preventive restriction would cause more harm than good. If the state acts as an arbiter of abuse, soon it will begin to act as arbiter of use, and any real notion of private property and liberty would be lost." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} cut of {{the film}} ran for slightly over two hours, and several scenes were cut out, including a scene which depicted an extended scene of Kerry and Rigg examining Troy's trap, where Kerry reveals to Rigg she has had nightmares about Eric, and she blames herself {{for what happened to}} him. Adam had more scenes in the original cut. A scene that showed Jigsaw regretting his actions was also cut. Bell said, [...] "I'm glad they cut that scene. This guy knows exactly what he's doing. Does he start off with a model, then refine it? Yeah, he probably does. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> things that are interesting and advance the story, and there are other things that are basically sort of backstory, and you don't really need to know".|$|E
2500|$|... "Hyperion Heights" [...] was {{directed}} by Ralph Hemecker and written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. In January 2017, while season 6 was still in production, ABC president Channing Dungey spoke of a possible [...] "reset" [...] of the show's narrative. After much speculation, executive producers Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis later confirmed that certain characters would have their storylines wrapped up and that the back-end of the sixth season had been written with the season 7 narrative change in mind. Despite the major changes from seasons past, the showrunners {{have said that they}} do not view season 7 as a complete reboot of the show: [...] "We're more thinking about it as a hybrid of a lot of things. We're paying homage to the original premise, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> characters who are returning and some who are not. It's a combination of a lot of things, but what we're trying to do is go in a new direction but stay true to the spirit of what the show has always been." [...] ABC renewed the series for a seventh season on May 11, 2017. The premiere date was revealed in July, along with announcement of the new timeslot, Fridays. The table read for this installment began in July 7, 2017.|$|E

"The paper survived because <b>there</b> <b>were</b> so {{many people}} {{willing to work for}} nothing or next to nothing because they had a common vision: all that Sixties and early-Seventies bullshit" [...] Larkin later recalled. [...] "The anti-war {{movement}} <b>was</b> valid, certainly, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>certain</b> elements of the hippie movement that the paper took advantage of.
