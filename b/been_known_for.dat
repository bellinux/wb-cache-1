5|$|Glass fiber {{is formed}} when thin strands of silica-based or other {{formulation}} glass are extruded into many fibers with small diameters suitable for textile processing. The technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers has <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> millennia; however, {{the use of}} these fibers for textile applications is more recent. Until this time, all glass fiber had been manufactured as staple (that is, clusters of short lengths of fiber).|$|E

5|$|Further {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} the Kuiper belt later emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their volatile surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually dispersing them. In order for comets to continue to be visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently. One such area of replenishment is the Oort cloud, a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 AU from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. The Oort cloud is thought to be the point of origin of long-period comets, which are those, like Hale–Bopp, with orbits lasting thousands of years.|$|E

5|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> {{some time}} that St Kilda was {{continuously}} inhabited for two millennia or more, from the Bronze Age to the 20th century. Recently, the first direct evidence of earlier Neolithic settlement emerged—shards of pottery of the Hebridean ware style, found {{to the east of}} the village. The subsequent discovery of a quarry for stone tools on Mullach Sgar above Village Bay led to finds of numerous stone hoe-blades, grinders and Skaill knives in the Village Bay cleitean—unique stone storage buildings (see below). These tools are also probably of Neolithic origin.|$|E
5|$|The Helix has {{traditionally}} <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> offering {{a panoramic view}} of the New York skyline. While local zoning laws prohibit the construction of high-rise buildings that would obstruct sight-lines from higher points in town, as of June 2013 construction of a new residential building partially blocked the view from the lower portion of the roadway. As of 2015, the Helix is considered by the PANYNJ to have a working life-span of ten years. Alternatives to its replacement include tunnels under the Palisades directly to the Lincoln Tunnel portals.|$|E
5|$|The {{carcinogenity}} of chromate dust has <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> a long time, and in 1890 {{the first}} publication described the elevated cancer risk {{of workers in}} a chromate dye company. Three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the genotoxicity of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the DNA. The last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of the end product of the chromium(III) reduction.|$|E

5|$|The {{toxicity}} of certain Galerina species has <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> a century. In 1912, Charles Horton Peck reported a human poisoning case due to G.autumnalis. In 1954, a poisoning {{was caused by}} G.venenata. Between 1978 and 1995, ten cases caused by amatoxin-containing Galerinas were reported in the literature. Three European cases, two from Finland and one from France were attributed to G.marginata and G.unicolor, respectively. Seven North American exposures included two fatalities from Washington due to G.venenata, with five cases reacting positively to treatment; four poisonings were caused by G.autumnalis from Michigan and Kansas, in addition to poisoning caused by an unidentified Galerina species from Ohio. Several poisonings {{have been attributed to}} collectors consuming the mushrooms after mistaking them for the hallucinogenic Psilocybe stuntzii.|$|E
5|$|To market Zorro, TriStar {{purchased}} a 30-second advertising spot at Super Bowl XXXII for $1.3 million. Sony, who had <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> their low-key {{presence at the}} ShoWest trade show, showed clips from the film, while actors Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins presented a panel at the conference on May 10, 1998. The studio also attached Zorros trailer to prints of Godzilla. Sony launched an official website in June 1998. Internet marketing was an emerging concept in the late-1990s, and Zorro was Sony's first film to use VRML.|$|E
5|$|Black's wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) is {{approached}} at her new job by a colleague, who {{reveals that}} the company is part of the Odessa network. Meanwhile, Black visits Catherine's boss Clear Knight (Kimberly Patton), experiencing visions of Nazi Germany after seeing a watercolour painting in her office. Later that night Black is visited by Means and the Old Man (R. G. Armstrong), another high-ranking Group member. They explain to Black that the Group has, throughout history, been privy to scientific discoveries of which the public has no knowledge. Johnstone had theorised the existence of a tear in the universe which would reach Earth in several decades; his death may be connected to this theory. The Old Man also explains that the Group has been infiltrated in the hopes of splintering it, by members of the Odessa network—a faction founded by fugitive Nazis which had previously <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> its anti-communist work and has now turned its focus to the Millennium Group.|$|E

5|$|In November 1946, Cowan became Manchester City manager, {{succeeding}} Wilf Wild, {{who moved}} to a purely administrative role. Cowan had <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> his motivational skills as a player, and {{was part of a}} new generation of managers who took responsibility for tactics and team selection, of which Cowan's contemporary and former teammate Matt Busby became the most well-known. Cowan was given a salary of £2,000, and came to an agreement whereby he spent part of the week with the Manchester City team and part looking after his business interests in Brighton. His first match as manager was a 3–0 win against Newport County, and the team then embarked upon a run of 19 matches without defeat. Despite achieving the Division Two title in his first season in charge, Cowan resigned in June 1947 as his commute from Brighton caused tension with club officials.|$|E
5|$|Iodine oxides are {{the most}} stable of all the halogen oxides, because of the strong I–O bonds {{resulting}} from the large electronegativity difference between iodine and oxygen, and they have <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> the longest time. The stable, white, hygroscopic iodine pentoxide (I2O5) has been known since its formation in 1813 by Gay-Lussac and Davy. It is most easily made by the dehydration of iodic acid (HIO3), which it is the anhydride of. It will quickly oxidise carbon monoxide completely to carbon dioxide at room temperature, and is thus a useful reagent in determining carbon monoxide concentration. It also oxidises nitrogen oxide, ethylene, and hydrogen sulfide. It reacts with sulfur trioxide and peroxydisulfuryl difluoride (S2O6F2) to form salts of the iodyl cation, +, and is reduced by concentrated sulfuric acids to iodosyl salts involving +. It may be fluorinated by fluorine, bromine trifluoride, sulfur tetrafluoride, or chloryl fluoride, resulting iodine pentafluoride, which also reacts with iodine pentoxide, giving iodine(V) oxyfluoride, IOF3. A few other less stable oxides are known, notably I4O9 and I2O4; their structures have not been determined, but reasonable guesses are IIII(IVO3)3 and +− respectively.|$|E
5|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> {{more than}} a century that {{consumption}} of raw or insufficiently cooked shellfish can be associated with infectious diseases. These are caused either by bacteria naturally present in the sea such as Vibrio spp. or by viruses and bacteria from sewage effluent that sometimes contaminates coastal waters. As filter feeders, bivalves pass large quantities of water through their gills, filtering out the organic particles, including the microbial pathogens. These are retained in the animals' tissues and become concentrated in their liver-like digestive glands. Another possible source of contamination occurs when bivalves contain marine biotoxins as a result of ingesting numerous dinoflagellates. These microalgae are not associated with sewage but occur unpredictably as algal blooms. Large areas of a sea or lake may change colour {{as a result of the}} proliferation of millions of single-cell algae, and this condition is known as a red tide.|$|E
