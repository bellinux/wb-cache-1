Before snowboard specific boots existed, snowboarders used any means necessary to attach their feet to their snowboards and gain the leverage needed for turning.

50|$|Telemark skiing, or teleskiing, is a skiing {{technique}} that combines elements of Alpine and Nordic skiing. Telemark skiing {{is named after}} the Telemark region of Norway, where the discipline originated. Sondre Norheim is often credited for first demonstrating the turn in ski races, which included cross country, slalom and jumping, in Norway around 1868. Sondre Norheim also experimented with ski and <b>binding</b> <b>design,</b> introducing side cuts to skis and heel bindings (like a cable).|$|E
50|$|The {{widespread}} {{introduction of}} plastic boots in the 1970s changed the market considerably.

These entered a market in the 1970s where plate-type bindings, including Spademan, held roughly half the binding market. In 1978 Spademan had excellent sales and {{was by far the}} best selling US <b>binding</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E

This added a loop of twisted birch roots that ran from the existing birch root toe loops around the boot heels and back. This allowed the heel to lift as before, for walking and gliding, but better held the boots to the skis allowing greater control. This enabled Norheim to control the skis with his feet and legs, replacing the former technique of dragging a large pole in the snow on {{one side or the}} other to drag the skier in that direction. These new techniques spread throughout Telemark and would later be named for the region.|$|E

In this communication our {{aim is to}} elucidate the synergy between language independent features and simple language model features. We consider term tag features estimated by a so-called part-of-speech tagger. The feature sets are combined in an early <b>binding</b> <b>design</b> with an optimized binding coe#cient that allows weighting of the relative variance contributions of the participating feature sets. With the combined features documents are classified using a latent semantic indexing representation and a probabilistic neural network classifier.

The most significant enhancement is found for small text databases where high recognition rates are possible...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the seminar "Reading Things" at CRAASH, Cambridge University. With industrialization in the 19 th century, book culture went {{through a number of}} changes. Like many other goods, literature began to be sold in retail packages – readymade bookbindings that conveyed the character of the literary content of the book. Objects such as packages and bookbindings took on an increasingly important place in the public and private spaces of modern society, spreading new imagery and symbolic messages. The use and handling of books and packages coincided with a use and handling of trade marks and logotypes and of a new world of images which introduced a number of new elements in everyday life. In this paper I will concentrate on the emergence of publishers’ bookbindings, and especially decorated cloth bindings: Why did publishers take on the commissioning of bindings, what kind of interaction between technology, economics and aesthetics took place on the book market, how can we understand the changes in <b>binding</b> <b>design</b> and how did modern, decorated bookbindings influence peoples relations to books and literature...|$|E
