60|$|Among birds {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} and remarkable are, the great-billed vulture-crows (Corvultur), the long-tailed {44} whydah finches (Vidua), the curious ox-peckers (Buphaga), the splendid metallic starlings (Lamprocolius), the handsome plantain-eaters (Musophaga), the ground-hornbills (Bucorvus), the numerous guinea-fowls belonging to four distinct genera, the serpent-eating secretary-bird (Serpentarius), the huge <b>boat-billed</b> <b>heron</b> (Balæniceps), and the true ostriches. There are also three quite peculiar African families, the Musophagidæ or plantain-eaters, including the elegant crested touracos; the curious little finch-like colies (Coliidæ), and the Irrisoridæ, insect-eating birds allied to the hoopoes but with glossy metallic plumage and arboreal habits.|$|E
50|$|This {{classification}} {{does not}} include tapeta lucida in birds. Kiwis, stone-curlews, the <b>boat-billed</b> <b>heron,</b> the flightless kakapo and many nightjars, owls, and other night birds such as the swallow-tailed gull also possess a tapetum lucidum. This classification also {{does not include}} the extraordinary focusing mirror {{in the eye of the}} brownsnout spookfish.|$|E
50|$|The <b>boat-billed</b> <b>heron</b> (Cochlearius cochlearius), colloquially {{known as}} the boatbill, is an {{atypical}} member of the heron family, and was formerly thought {{to be in a}} monotypic family, Cochlearidae. It lives in mangrove swamps from Mexico south to Peru and Brazil. It is a nocturnal bird, and breeds semi-colonially in mangrove trees, laying 2-4 bluish white eggs in a twig nest.|$|E
50|$|<b>Boat-billed</b> <b>herons</b> {{range from}} Mexico to Peru, Brazil, northeastern Argentina. They are {{non-migratory}} birds {{that tend to}} live in seasonal lagoons and estuaries, and will nest in mangroves.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Boat-billed</b> <b>Herons</b> breed {{during the}} rainy season and have been {{recorded}} producing two clutches during this time, laying their first clutch in February during the end of the dry season. Their clutch sizes range from 2 to 4 eggs, with more eggs being laid during the first nesting period than the second. They usually nest in colonies but have been observed nesting solitarily. Human disturbance can lead to a decrease in reproductive success as herons tend to avoid human contact and will abandon nests if necessary.|$|R
40|$|The {{breeding}} {{success of}} a double-brooding colony of <b>Boat-billed</b> <b>Herons</b> Cochlearius cochlearius was studied in pasturelands of Costa Rica. Mean clutch size in the first clutches (2. 9 eggs/nest) was higher than in second and repeat clutches (2. 3 eggs/nest). Breeding success was similar in the first attempt and second attempts (20. 7 % and 21. 7 %, respectively). In both attempts earlier nests enjoyed a higher breeding success. Starvation of the youngest chicks within the nest and destruction of nests by bad weather conditions were the main factors related to nestling death. No effects of human activity on the reproduction of the breeding colony were observed...|$|R
5000|$|The {{human face}} {{carved into the}} stone is {{unremarkable}} except for the long bill that extends down his chest. This bill {{has been identified as}} belonging to the <b>boat-billed</b> <b>heron,</b> a locally abundant bird along the Tabasco and southern Veracruz Gulf Coast. [...] Raised wings or a wing-like cape envelop the body while feet have been incised into the base.|$|E
50|$|The {{classification}} {{of the individual}} heron/egret species is fraught with difficulty, and no clear consensus exists about the correct placement of many species into {{either of the two}} major genera, Ardea and Egretta. Similarly, the relationships of the genera in the family are not completely resolved. However, one species formerly considered to constitute a separate monotypic family, the Cochlearidaeor the <b>boat-billed</b> <b>heron,</b> is now regarded {{as a member of the}} Ardeidae.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the species}} {{that can be easily}} seen are scarlet ibis and {{bleeding}} heart doves, named after the red spot of feathers on their chests. But if you look more closely in the tree, you may see a <b>boat-billed</b> <b>heron</b> looking for fish or a tanager feeding on fruit. Masked lovebirds can be heard calling, red-billed leiothrix will dart at eye level looking for insects, and pygmy geese swim in the stream.|$|E
50|$|<b>Boat-billed</b> <b>herons</b> feed on {{shrimp and}} small fish such as Dormitator latifrons, {{a species of}} sleeper goby. They tend to forage in {{vegetative}} streams, shallow water, and lagoons. When foraging in streams they will use low hanging branches and mangrove roots to stand over the water. In ponds they will walk slowly through the water up to 10 cm deep or will forage near the water’s edge. In order to capture prey they will lunge at fish or scoop {{the surface of the}} water with their bills which are uniquely shaped for this method of capture. Additionally, they have been observed using two different feeding techniques; standing and slowly stalking prey, or disturbing the water and chasing prey.Boat-billed herons will forage nocturnally, and have been seen leaving the roost 30 minutes after sundown to feed. It has been observed that they do not feed when a light source is present such as daylight, moonlight, or artificial light. One study hypothesized that in order to forage for food in the dark and in shallow, muddy water, their bills are sensitive to touch which helps them feel for their prey.|$|R

Epub 2006 Dec. 15 Estudiamos el éxito reproductivo de una colonia del ave Cochlearius cochlearius en una zona ganadera de Costa Rica. El promedio de huevos por nido fue mayor durante el periodo de primeras puestas (2. 9 huevos/nido) que durante el periodo de segundas puestas y reposiciones (2. 3 huevos/nido). El éxito reproductor de los dos periodos fue similar (20. 7 % y 21. 7 %, respectivamente). En ambos tuvieron más éxito las parejas que comenzaron la puesta antes.

50|$|The bill is {{generally}} long and harpoon-like. It {{can vary from}} extremely fine, as in the agami heron, to thick as in the grey heron. The most atypical bill {{is owned by the}} <b>boat-billed</b> <b>heron,</b> which has a broad, thick bill. The bill, as well as other bare parts of the body, is usually yellow, black, or brown in colour, although this can vary during the breeding season. The wings are broad and long, exhibiting 10 or 11 primary feathers (the <b>boat-billed</b> <b>heron</b> has only nine), 15-20 secondaries. and 12 rectrices (10 in the bitterns). The feathers of the herons are soft and the plumage is usually blue, black, brown, grey, or white, and can often be strikingly complex. Amongst the day herons, little sexual dimorphism in plumage is seen (except in the pond-herons); differences between the sexes are the rule for the night herons and smaller bitterns. Many species also have different colour morphs. In the Pacific reef heron, both dark and light colour morphs exist, and the percentage of each morph varies geographically. White morphs only occur in areas with coral beaches.|$|E
5000|$|Over 90 {{bird species}} -both migratory and resident- have been reported, {{including}} a large nesting heron population (Ardeidae), cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), pelicans (Pelecanidae), ibises (Threskiornithidae), plovers, dotterels, lapwings (Charadriidae) and gull species (Laridae). [...] Bird species of special concern {{found in the}} park but which may be under threat in Guatemala, are: Pied-billed Grebe (Podilymbus podiceps), brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis), Great White Egret (Ardea alba), Snowy Egret (Egretta thula), Little Blue Heron Egretta caeruleaTricolored Heron (Egretta tricolor), Green Heron (Butorides virescens), Yellow-crowned Night Heron (Nyctanassa violacea), <b>Boat-billed</b> <b>Heron</b> (Cochlearius cochlearius), Roseate Spoonbill (Platalea ajaja), Wood Stork (Mycteria americana), Black-necked Stilt (Himantopus mexicanus), and Least Tern (Sterna antillarum).|$|E
50|$|The <b>boat-billed</b> <b>heron</b> {{grows to}} about 54 cm long. Adult boat-billed herons are pale grey to white in color, with {{chestnut}} colored abdomens and black flanks. The massive broad scoop-like bill, which {{gives rise to}} this species' name, is mainly black. They are also adorned with a crest which {{is thought to be}} used in mate attraction as they are larger in males. The sexes are similar in appearance, the main differences being that females are slightly smaller, grayer in appearance, and have shorter crests than males. Newly hatched nestlings have green-yellow skin, with their upperparts covered in gray down feathers. Their upper bill is black and they have green-yellow legs. Juveniles are darker in color than adults and lack a crest.|$|E
50|$|Courtship {{usually takes}} {{part on the}} nest. Males arrive first and begin the {{building}} of the nest, where they display to attract females. During courtship, the male employs a stretch display and uses erectile neck feathers; the neck area may swell. The female risks an aggressive attack if she approaches too soon and may have to wait up to four days. In colonial species, displays involve visual cues, which can include adopting postures or ritual displays, whereas in solitary species, auditory cues, such as the deep booming of the bitterns, are important. The exception to this is the <b>boat-billed</b> <b>heron,</b> which pairs up away from the nesting site. Having paired, they continue to build the nest in almost all species, although in the little bittern and least bittern, only the male works on the nest.|$|E
