As well as some suspension and steering system changes, the biggest update was an improved diesel engine. This shared many parts with its petrol-fuelled sibling, including the <b>block,</b> <b>valve</b> gear, cooling systems and lubrication systems. A forged crankshaft was used for added strength, and different pistons were needed. The cylinder head used the same basic casting, but was very different internally, being in essence an updated version of that used on the original 2-litre engine, to which the new diesel bore a strong external resemblance. Like the 2.25-litre petrol, the 2.25-litre diesel was a dry-liner design. It was built on the same production line as the petrol engine and the flexibility of the basic design was much in evidence- for example, where the diesel engines had their fuel injector pumps, the petrol engine had its distributor fitted. Although it offered a modest improvement in power and a useful jump in torque, the main benefit of the new diesel engine was that it was much quieter and more efficient than the older unit. It also proved to be much more reliable in service. Like the petrol engine, the diesel was upgraded to a 5-bearing crankshaft in 1980. The engine was fitted to the Austin FX4 Black Cab between 1982 and 1985. FX4s fitted with the engine were designated 'FX4R' ('R' for 'Rover'). In this application the engine gained a reputation for very short service life and unreliability. This was caused by the significantly greater times spent at idle speed in the Black Cab than in the Land Rover. Solihull engineers had warned Carbodies, builders of the FX4R that this would cause problems as at idle speed the engine's oil pressure dropped, causing the automatic tensioner unit for the timing chain to not operate fully. At the high number of hours spent at idle speed (taxi drivers tended to leave the engines idling for long period whilst waiting for passengers or when off-duty as well as all the time spent in stationary traffic in London) this caused the timing chains to stretch, causing incorrect fuel injection timing which greatly reduced engine life.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an extensive simulation study of power {{loss in the}} lubricating gap between cylinder block and valve plate. The simulation model used in this investigation covers fluid structure interaction and micro motion of the cylinder block resulting from oscillating piston forces. The model calculates pressure and velocity fields generated in the lubricating film as well as leakage, and viscous friction. Details of the model are explained. Using the model, power losses in the cylinder <b>block</b> <b>valve</b> plate gap are investigated {{as a function of}} operating condition for three displacement units. It is shown that power losses for low load operating conditions are approximately the same as power loss for high load operating conditions. In order to reduce losses at low loads, a sinusoidal or wavy micro structured surface is applied to the cylinder block surface. The effect of operating parameters that waved surfaces of varying amplitude and frequency have on power loss in the cylinder <b>block</b> <b>valve</b> plate interface when compared to power loss of a standard, ideally smooth sliding surface is studied. As the gap height of the lubricating film represents the most critical parameter relating to pump performance, special attention is given to the relation between gap height, operating parameters, surface design and power loss.

In this research, a novel study on gas dehydration a combination of absorption and adsorption process, where tri-ethylene glycol (TEG) and silica gel are absorbent and adsorbent respectively. A laboratory absorption-adsorption unit is studied in terms of natural gas (methane) flow rate and operating temperature to the percentage of water removal. The experimental work started at room temperature by controlling the valve of methane flow rate at 2. 5 m 3 /hr initially and then allows the gas through the absorption-adsorption unit. Meanwhile, tri-ethylene glycol (TEG) flows at 120 L/hr from a circulation pump. Experiment was repeated with different methane flow rates and different operating temperature in the range of 30 oC until 50 oC. Experimental results showed that, increasing of methane flow rate causes increasing of water removal while increasing of operating temperature give a result of decreasing of water removal. Thus, in analyzing the gas dehydration efficiency, in an absorption-adsorption unit, parameters such as gas (methane) flow rate and operating temperature are among to be considered for a reliability and economic benefit. -Author...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{identify}} and quantify new seismic and volcanic risks threatening the strategic Caspian {{oil and gas}} pipelines through the Republic of Georgia, {{in the vicinity of}} the recent Abuli Samsari Volcanic Ridge, and evaluate risk reduction measures, mitigation measures, and monitoring. As regards seismic risk, we identified a major, NW-SE trending strike-slip fault; based on the analysis of fault planes along this major transcurrent structure, an about N-S trend of the maximum, horizontal compressive stress (σ 1) was determined, which is in good agreement with data instrumentally derived after the 1986, M 5. 6 Paravani earthquake and its aftershock. Particularly notable is the strong alignment of volcanic vents along an about N-S trend that suggests a magma rising controlled by the about N-S-directed σ 1. The original pipeline design included mitigation measures for seismic risk and other geohazards, including burial of the pipeline for its entire length, increased wall thickness, <b>block</b> <b>valve</b> spacing near recognized hazards, and monitoring of known landslide hazards. However, the design did not consider volcanic risk or the specific seismic hazards revealed by this study. The result of our analysis is that the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline, as well as the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzerum South Caucasian natural gas pipeline (SCP) were designed in such a way that they significantly reduce the risk posed by the newly-identified geohazards {{in the vicinity of the}} Abuli-Samsari Ridge. No new measures are recommended for the pipeline itself as a result of this study. However, since the consequences of long-term shut-down would be very damaging to the economies of Western Europe, we conclude that the regionally significant BTC and SCP warrant greater protections, described in the final section of or work. The overall objective of our effort is to present the results in a matrix framework that allows the technical information to be used further in the decision-making process, with the goal of reducing the uncertainty in the final decision. This approach is applicable to the study of risks in other pipeline systems...|$|E

A second oil release occurred on December 1, 2010 when a <b>block</b> <b>valve</b> associated with the same Chevron pipeline in close proximity to the first release failed. Fortunately, this crude oil did not enter Red Butte Creek. DWQ issued NOV I 10 - 05 to CPL for this second incident on January 19, 2011. Clean-up efforts were completed for this release and DWQ subsequently issued a close out letter dated March 22, 2012 formally closing out NOV I 10 - 05. Background On June 10, 2010, approximately 800 barrels (36, 600 gallons) of crude oil from a Chevron pipeline that crosses Red Butte Creek near the mouth of Red Butte Canyon was released with {{a large portion of the}} oil entering Red Butte Creek. Clean-up actions primarily by CPL, over the next months removed approximately 778 barrels (32, 676 gallons) from the creek. Monitoring efforts conducted jointly by the DEQ DWQ and Chevron’s contractor EarthFax, have been ongoing since the spill occurred and have evaluated water, sediment and bank soils, and macro-invertebrates in Red Butte Creek, and associated risks. Personnel from Salt Lake City Corporation and Salt Lake Valley Health Department also participated in evaluating potential impacts to human health and environment from the spill.

40|$|There are {{two main}} design issues in digital {{prototyping}} of swash plate type axial piston machines. First, {{the design of the}} rotating group with its lubricating interfaces is critical to the operation of the swash plate type axial machine. Swash plate type axial piston machines have three main lubricating interfaces - the Piston/Cylinder, the Cylinder block/Valve plate, and the Slipper/Swash plate interface. These lubricating interfaces fulfill simultaneously a bearing and sealing function. The three interfaces represent the most critical design issue within the design process of the swash plate type axial piston machine because these interfaces determine the performance and reliability of the machine and are the main source of energy dissipation. Ivantysynova and her research group (2001, 2002, 2005, 2010, and 2012) have developed fully coupled fluid structure interaction models based on non-isothermal flow through the lubricating gap for the three lubricating interfaces of swash plate type axial piston machines. The models consider the macro and micro motion of movable parts such as the piston, slipper, and cylinder block as well as the deformation of solid bodies due to pressure and temperature for all three interfaces. These models were developed separately for each interface. However, viscous friction forces generated in one interface are transferred to other interfaces, i. e. the friction force generated between piston and cylinder will load the cylinder block and therefore must be considered when calculating the cylinder <b>block</b> <b>valve</b> plate interface. Also, the friction force generated in the gap between the slipper and swash plate will act on the piston/slipper assembly and therefore must be considered when balancing forces acting on the piston. ^ The second design issue involves the valve plate design in the swash plate type axial piston machine. The valve plate is a non-rotating component in the axial piston machine that is located adjacent to the cylinder block. The valve plate connects the pump ports to the individual cylinder chambers. Proper valve plate design is essential for the high performance axial piston machine because the valve plate regulates the displacement chamber pressure profile in the axial piston machine. The pressure profile in the displacement chamber is important in regards to the axial piston machine operation because the pressure profile has a very significant influence on the resulting fluid film of each of the three interfaces, on moments acting on the swash plate, and flow ripple in the low/high pressure ports. The pressure in the displacement chamber transforms to the primary force acting on the piston/cylinder, cylinder block/valve plate, and slipper/swash plate interface. Because of the time dependent change of pressure in each cylinder chamber the resulting forces and moments are pulsating. In addition, the force acting on the slipper/swash plate transforms to the moments acting on the swash plate, which influence the controllability of the swash plate angle. The pulsating forces and moments acting on the swash plate not only have an influence on the controllability of the swash plate angle, but also represent one of the main sources of noise generated in the axial piston machine. The moment acting on the swash plate oscillates the swash plate and the end case simultaneously, which in the end results in audible noise. This noise source {{is often referred to as}} structure-borne noise (SBN). The other noise source, fluid-borne noise (FBN), is also related to the valve plate because FBN results mainly from flow ripple in the low/high pressure port. Flow ripple in the low/high pressure port is affected by the number of pistons of the axial piston machine, but it also has a strong relationship with the displacement chamber pressure. Therefore, the valve plate design significantly influences both SBN and FBN. And for this reason, much valve plate design research has been conducted in order to reduce noise in the axial piston machine. There are two types of valve plate noise reduction techniques: passive and active noise reduction technique. Of these two noise reduction techniques, the passive noise reduction technique has the advantage that it does not require any additional power source or system. However, this technique has the disadvantage that it is not effective for a wide range of operating conditions. Relief groove, pre-compression filter volume (PCFV), and cross port are examples of passive noise reduction techniques. In order to study these phenomena more accurately, Seeniraj and Ivantysynova developed a simulation tool, VpOptim, for valve plate simulation and optimization. VpOptim can be used for valve plate optimization by implementing relief grooves and the PCFV in the valve plate. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E
