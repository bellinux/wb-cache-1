500|$|Eventually, {{the review}} for Illmatic was {{handled by the}} magazine's {{columnist}} Miss Info (then writing under the nom de plume, [...] "shortie"), who shared Schecter's enthusiasm for Nas' album. In her review of Illmatic, Minyah wrote, [...] "I must maintain {{this is one of}} the best hip-hop albums I have ever heard" [...] and wrote of its content, [...] "Lyrically, the whole shit is on point. No cliched metaphors, no gimmicks. Never too abstract, never superficial." [...] She also commented on the impact of Nas's [...] "poetic realism" [...] writing: “Nas’ images remind me of the personal memories and people, both passed and present… All this may sound like melodrama but it not just me. I've <b>been</b> <b>hearing</b> similar responses all over. While 'Memory Lane' is my shit, my homies claim 'The World Is Yours,' and if you've got peoples doing time, then 'One Love' may hit you the hardest.". With the backing of Schecter and the other editors on the staff, Minya awarded Illmatic with the magazine's highest rating.|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics of}} Lukashenko, {{including}} the opposition group Zubr, {{use the term}} Lukashism {{to refer to the}} political and economic system Lukashenko has implemented in Belarus. The term is also used more broadly to refer to an authoritarian ideology based on a cult of his personality and nostalgia for Soviet times among certain groups in Belarus. [...] The US Congress sought to aid the opposition groups by passing the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 to introduce sanctions against Lukashenko's government and provide financial and other support to the opposition. Lukashenko supporters argue that his rule spared Belarus the turmoil that beset many other former Soviet countries. Lukashenko commented on the criticism of him by saying: [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>hearing</b> these accusations for over 10years and we have got used to it. We are not going to answer them. I want to come from the premise that the elections in Belarus are held for ourselves. I am sure that it is the Belarusian people who are the masters in our state." ...|$|E

500|$|Dan Martin of The Guardian {{was less}} favourable, stating the {{producers}} [...] "promised us a cliffhanger, and now we're left the whole summer long to contemplate whether our favourite show can really have just dropped the ball. Oh {{there was plenty}} to love about this mid-season finale, and even more to pick over. But as an hour of drama {{it was all over}} the place". Because the episode was so fast-paced with little being explained, he did not feel any emotional connection to the Anglican marines or Lorna Bucket. Unlike Fuller, Martin was not favourable to Smith's Doctor, stating [...] "the non-event of the battle means the Doctor never really gets to show this dark side we've <b>been</b> <b>hearing</b> so much about" [...] and that Smith's predecessor, David Tennant, [...] "got angrier most weeks". Martin did have praise for the final reveal of the episode, stating that although it had been [...] "hidden in plain view from the very beginning as soon as it's revealed Amy has called the baby Melody", he was unable to make the connection and was suitably surprised. Martin later rated it the second-to-worst episode of the series, though the finale {{was not included in the}} list.|$|E

[...] NME ranked the song at number 74 on their [...] "100 Best Track of the Noughties" [...] list, saying it [...] "encapsulated everything enviable in a well-crafted song" [...] and heralding it as Minogue's best single. In 2012, Priya Elan from NME ranked the song at number four on his [...] "The Greatest Pop Songs in History" [...] list, saying: [...] "It was unlike any song I remember hearing before." [...] In 2012, The Guardian included the song in their list of [...] "The Best Number One Records," [...] labelling it to be [...] "sleek, Arctic-blue minimalism, like an emotionally thwarted retelling of Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love."

500|$|In the {{behind the}} scenes video {{published}} by HBO following the airing of the fifth and sixth episodes, Benioff described Bran's visions {{at the beginning of}} the episode as being something that was put together very precisely and purposefully, noting [...] "Even though some of those images flash by in just a fraction of a second each of them was very carefully chosen. And the Mad King was probably the most dramatic of those because we've <b>been</b> <b>hearing</b> about the Mad King from the very beginning of the show, but he's never appeared on screen before. And shooting it, you know, spending a lot of time on what ended up being maybe like a second and a half, couple seconds, of screen time." [...] The new scenes of the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen, are interspersed with previously shown footage of the White Walkers, as well as wildfire explosions, and other landmark moments from throughout the series, such as Ned Stark's beheading, the Red Wedding, and Bran falling from the Broken Tower in the series premiere. In the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, the Mad King is described as having long, unkempt hair and beard, with nine inch long fingernails. The show's version portrayed his look in a more tidy fashion, with David Rintoul playing the role of the Mad King.|$|E

500|$|She {{has been}} labeled by the French media as [...] "the female Zidane" [...] - like Zinedine Zidane, she has Algerian ancestry, {{grew up in}} Marseille and {{possesses}} immense skill, especially as a playmaker with an eye for goal. As such, she has been nicknamed [...] "Ziza", a variant of Zidane's [...] "Zizou". In an interview with FIFA.com just before the 2012 Olympics, she alluded to the comparison, saying, [...] "Zidane is {{a role model for}} me. He was always the player that I most enjoyed watching. The comparison was made frequently when I was starting out, and now, as the years pass, it happens less and less often. But I wouldn't say I’m tired of it." [...] She often attempts to downplay the comparison, though, stating [...] "Being compared to Zidane is really nice, but I don’t think it can harm me because I’ve <b>been</b> <b>hearing</b> it since I was very young. It always makes me proud, but as I always say, I don’t think you can compare anyone to him. He’s unique". While training at the Clairefontaine academy in 2004, Nécib met Zidane, who was at the training center in preparation for qualifying for the 2006 World Cup (the finals would eventually be his last act as a professional). The two players exchanged shirts, and the shirt Nécib acquired from Zidane is currently in the possession of her father.|$|E
