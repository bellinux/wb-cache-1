5|$|By now the Ordainers {{had drawn}} up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little {{political}} choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> way and accept them in October. The Ordinances of 1311 contained clauses limiting the King's {{right to go}} to war or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances. In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that he {{should not be allowed to}} live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.|$|E
5|$|In Wonder Boy in Monster Land, players control Wonder Boy as he {{destroys the}} monsters in Monster Land and defeats the MEKA dragon. When the player begins the game, Wonder Boy starts {{out in the}} City of Wonder Land without any items or gold, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him a chance, at the {{beginning}} of the game, the city's mayor gives him a sword and a revival potion and sets him off on his own. The game is divided into twelve levels, and each of them has its own unique features, items, monsters, and secrets. These levels include towns, valleys, deserts, islands, and castles. Players use the D-pad to move Wonder Boy on the main screen, to enter doors by pressing upward, and to use Magic Weapons by pressing downward. The D-pad is also used to select between various items when in a shop. Players also have two buttons: one which makes Wonder Boy attack with his sword and buy items in the shop; and one which makes Wonder Boy jump and skip through storylines.|$|E

5|$|In prior cases, {{the fear}} had been {{expressed}} that using parliamentary debates as evidence in court could violate parliamentary privilege, under Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 (since using parliamentary debates as evidence would involve discussing {{what went on}} in Parliament within the courts). Browne-Wilkinson held that: In my judgment, the plain meaning of article 9, viewed against the historical background in which it was enacted, was to ensure that Members of Parliament were not subjected to any penalty, civil or criminal for what they said and were able, contrary to the previous assertions of the Stuart monarchy, to discuss what they, as opposed to the monarch, chose to have discussed. Relaxation of the rule will not involve the courts in criticising what is said in Parliament. The purpose of looking at Hansard will not be to construe the words used by the Minister <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> effect to the words used so long as they are clear. Far from questioning the independence of Parliament and its debates, the courts would be giving effect to what is said and done there.|$|E
25|$|Party leaders {{apparently}} {{took advantage}} of Trollope's eagerness to stand, and of his willingness {{to spend money on}} a campaign. Beverley had a long history of vote-buying and of intimidation by employers and others. Every election since 1857 had been followed by a petition alleging corruption, and it was estimated that 300 of the 1100 voters in 1868 would sell their votes. The task of a Liberal candidate was not to win the election, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the Conservative candidates an opportunity to display overt corruption, which could then be used to disqualify them.|$|E
25|$|At the Congress of Vienna, Maria Luisa's {{interests}} were {{represented by the}} Spanish emissary Marquis of Labrador, an incompetent man, who did not successfully advance his country's or Maria Luisa's diplomatic goals. The Austrian Minister Metternich {{had decided not to}} restore Parma to the House of Bourbon, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it to Napoleon's wife, Marie Louise of Austria. Maria Luisa pleaded her cause to her brother Ferdinand VII of Spain, the Pope, and Tsar Alexander I of Russia. Ultimately, the Congress decided to compensate Maria Luisa and her son with the smaller Duchy of Lucca, which was carved out of Tuscany. She was to retain the honors of a queen as she had before in Etruria.|$|E

25|$|Roberts was a {{real estate}} {{salesperson}} in 1964 when Abe Hirschfeld hired her {{to sit in the}} lobby and sell at 925 Park Avenue in New York. She was a condominium broker in 1968 when she met and began her involvement with the then-married multi-millionaire real estate entrepreneur Harry Helmsley. In 1970, she joined one of Helmsley's brokerage firms—Brown, Harris, Stevens—as a senior vice-president. At that time, she was already a millionaire in her own right. Helmsley divorced his wife of 33 years and married Roberts on April 8, 1972. Roberts's marriage to Helmsley may well have saved her career. Late in 1971, several of her tenants sued her for forcing the tenants of one of the apartments she managed to buy condominiums. They won, and she was forced not only to compensate the tenants <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them three-year leases. Her real estate license was also suspended, so she focused on running Helmsley's growing hotel empire.|$|E
25|$|In Hong Kong and Macau, the {{day after}} the Mid-Autumn Festival is a public holiday rather than the festival date itself (unless that date falls on a Sunday, then Monday is also a holiday), because many celebration events are held at night. There are a number of festive {{activities}} such as lighting lanterns, but mooncakes are the most important feature there. However, people don't usually buy mooncakes for themselves, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> their relatives as presents. People start to exchange these presents well in advance of the festival. Hence, mooncakes are sold in elegant boxes for presentation purpose. Also, the price for these boxes are not considered cheap—a four-mooncake box of the lotus seeds paste with egg yolks variety, can generally cost US$40 or more. However, as environmental protection has become a concern of the public in recent years, many mooncake manufacturers in Hong Kong have adopted practices to reduce packaging materials to practical limits. The mooncake manufacturers also explore in the creation of new types of mooncakes, such as ice-cream mooncake and snow skin mooncake.|$|E
25|$|A {{prayer of}} {{petition}} is {{a request to}} God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> definite form to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention on what we have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of a prayer of petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name.|$|E

25|$|Another major feud for WrestleMania X8 was {{the rivalry}} between The Undertaker and the WWF co-owner, Ric Flair. The feud started over The Undertaker's ambush on The Rock during the buildup to No Way Out, with Undertaker giving The Rock a chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver onto a car. Shortly afterwards, Ric Flair openly detested The Undertaker's actions. At the No Way Out event, Flair {{interfered}} with Undertaker's match against The Rock, finally hitting Undertaker with a lead pipe to aid The Rock in victory. Far from pleased over this result, The Undertaker challenged Flair to a match at WrestleMania. Flair refused, stating {{that he is}} an owner and no longer a wrestler. However, Undertaker tried to convince Flair by attacking select members of Flair's friends and family. Following a match on the February 25 episode of Raw, Flair's friend Arn Anderson was ambushed by The Undertaker during his road agent duties. The Undertaker followed this the following week by attacking Flair's son David, threatening that the rest of Flair's children would follow. Upon this attack, Flair accepted the match on the March 7 episode of SmackDown!. Later that night, the two ended up brawling into the audience, resulting in Flair punching out a fan by accident. As a result, Flair was arrested to Undertaker's delight. On the March 11 episode of Raw, Flair's rival co-owner Mr. McMahon asked for an emergency board meeting with the WWF board of directors citing that Flair's attack of a fan was unacceptable and that either he or Flair should have absolute authority and power over the company. With Flair still keen on taking on Undertaker at WrestleMania, CEO Linda McMahon had no choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Vince total control over the company. Despite this, Linda also stated that the ownership situation would also be reviewed after WrestleMania with a final decision. To add further insult, Mr. McMahon booked David Flair in a match against The Undertaker on the March 14 episode of SmackDown!. The Undertaker almost gave David a Last Ride, but was stopped by Ric Flair who saved his son with some steel chair shots.|$|E
500|$|Victor's plan rapidly {{developed}} momentum. Ruffin's advance sufficed to {{send the}} five rearguard Spanish battalions running, leaving only Browne's battalion defending the ridge and, confronted by the French dragoons, Whittingham's cavalry decided to retire. [...] Whittingham lent a single squadron of KGL hussars to Browne to cover his retreat; Browne initially positioned his battalion {{in the ruins of}} a chapel at the summit but, seeing Whittingham's retreat and spotting six French battalions advancing on his position, he had little choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> way and seek Graham's force in the woods. [...] Barrosa Ridge fell unopposed as Victor had intended, and Ruffin [...] a battery of artillery on the heights.|$|E

500|$|In December 1992, McEntire's seventeenth studio album, It's Your Call, was released. It {{became her}} first album to peak within the Billboard 200 Top 10, {{reaching}} No. 8. McEntire {{commented that the}} record was a [...] "second chapter" [...] to For My Broken Heart, while music reviewers such as Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly disagreed, writing, [...] "In truth, it isn't nearly as pessimistic as its predecessor—and unfortunately it isn't anywhere as involving." [...] Nash called the album's title track—which peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart—"one of those moment-of-truth sagas at which McEntire excels. In the song, a wife answers the phone to find her husband's girlfriend {{on the other end}} and seizes the opportunity not only to inform her mate that she knows of his affair <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him the ultimatum of choosing between the two. She's not the only one who's waitin' on the line, she sings, handing her husband the phone. It's your call." ...|$|E
500|$|Tomb Raider: Underworld is {{a single}} player, action-adventure video game. The game is {{presented}} in third person perspective, where the player takes control of Lara Croft. Lara's environment reproduces a more [...] "interactive world that reacts and remembers", such that footprints left in the mud or mud transferred to Lara's knee from kneeling {{on the ground is}} washed away by rain, the bodies of the foes she encounters remain where she killed them, and any destruction to the environment she causes is permanent. According to creative director Eric Lindstrom, this is [...] "to not only reward the player for the effect they're having on the world, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them navigational aids." [...] The game uses an animation blending system that allows Lara to interact dynamically with her environment, such as pushing foliage aside with one or two hands, depending on if she is carrying a weapon. It also features a [...] "hybrid lighting model that combines dynamic lights with carefully created light maps" [...] and a weather system that changes the environment, for example, [...] "If Lara’s negotiating a wet ledge she’s more apt to slip or lose grip," [...] which makes [...] "the environment [...] her adversary" [...] for {{a large part of the}} game.|$|E

500|$|On 17 May 1636, Hale {{was called}} to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn, and {{immediately}} became the pupil of William Noy. Hale and Noy became close friends, {{to the point where}} he was referred to as [...] "the young Noy", and more crucially he also met and befriended John Selden, a [...] "man of almost universal learning, whose theories were to dominate much of [...] later thought". Selden persuaded him to continue with his studies outside the law, and much of Hale's written work is concerned with theology and science as well as legal theory. Hale gained a good legal practise, although he allowed his Christian faith to govern his work. He sought to help the court reach a just verdict, whatever his client's concerns, and normally returned half his fee or charged a standard fee of 10 shillings rather than allow costs to inflate. He refused to accept unjust cases, and always tried to be on the [...] "right" [...] side of any case; John Campbell wrote that [...] "If he saw that a cause was unjust, he for a great while would not meddle further in it <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> his advice that it was so; if the parties after that would go on, they were to seek another counsellor, for he would assist none in acts of injustice".|$|E
500|$|In May2007, Usher {{split with}} Patton as his manager. This {{prompted}} [...] "gossip" [...] that Usher had [...] "fired" [...] {{her because of}} his growing relationship with Foster. He denied the claims, saying, [...] "I love my mother ... I decided not to fire, not get rid of, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> [...] the ultimate complimentto retire {{her to be a}} full-time grandmother." [...] He continued by stating that the split was a mutual decision. It was speculated that Patton's dismissal was due to his engagement with Foster; Usher dismissed these claims on Total Request Live (TRL) in May2008. In what MTV News' Shawn Adler called an [...] "angry tirade", Usher stated, [...] "My wife {{had nothing to do with}} me firing my mother — nothing like that, that's trash. I hear y'all talking crazy out there. She's a beautiful black woman. Stop. Stop talking. And I love her. Stop it." [...] The outbreak was compared to Mariah Carey's unannounced 2001 appearance on TRL, when she handed out popsicles to the show's audience and performed a [...] "striptease", while some fans noted Usher's speech as evidence that Foster was being controlling of Usher. Usher hired Benny Medina as his new manager; Medina said of Usher, [...] "The thing that excited me most is the intense commitment to his art, his incredible professionalism and the fact that I feel as though he's just hitting a stride." ...|$|E
500|$|Manchester City {{started the}} match strongly, {{particularly}} Francis Lee; The Guardian correspondent wrote [...] "Lee, indefatigable and nigh irresistible continually embarrassed the Górnik defence {{in the early}} stages". Lee had the first chance of the match, a close range shot which was saved by Kostka. Manchester City {{took the lead in}} the 12th minute. Lee cut in from the left wing, escaping a tackle from Alfred Olek, and struck a fierce shot. Goalkeeper Hubert Kostka parried the ball, only for it to land at the feet of Neil Young for a simple finish. Shortly after City defender Mike Doyle sustained an ankle injury after colliding with Stefan Florenski. Manchester City played on with ten men for a period as Doyle received treatment from trainer Dave Ewing, but the defender was unable to continue. Substitute Ian Bowyer replaced him. The change prompted an alteration in formation, in which Colin Bell switched to a deeper position. [...] Shortly before half-time, Young won the ball after loose play from Florenski, which put him clear on goal. As Young moved into the penalty area Kostka rushed out of his goal and upended him, leaving the referee no option <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> a penalty. Lee struck the spot-kick with power into the centre of the goal. Kostka's legs made contact with the ball, but the force of the shot carried it into the net to make it 2–0. Górnik got a goal back midway through the second half, but there were no more goals and the match finished 2–1.|$|E
