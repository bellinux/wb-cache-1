The <b>base</b> <b>map</b> mainly includes traffic sings and traffic markings. Drawing traffic accident scene graph is a necessary link during disposing road traffic accident, while drawing the <b>base</b> <b>map</b> costs {{most of the time}} of drawing traffic accident scene. In order to save processing time of dealing with the traffic accident, the concept of road <b>base</b> <b>map</b> is proposed. The symbol design and data organization of the <b>base</b> <b>map</b> are analyzed. All this provides a new way to make the traffic accident scene graph...|$|R
