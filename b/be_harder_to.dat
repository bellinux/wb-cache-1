5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began {{shifting}} strategies. The UN began to redeploy its forces to more defensible locations, {{so that they would}} <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> attack or take hostage. More importantly, Gen. Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E

5|$|Lobengula {{refused to}} allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document. Exactly why he did this is not clear. Rudd's {{interpretation}} was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so {{did not think it}} necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt that it would <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E
50|$|Membrane {{proteins}} <b>are</b> inherently <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> design, {{in large}} part because it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> validate the designs experimentally for several reasons. Membrane proteins <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> purify. Their structure <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> characterize because they adopt their native conformation only {{in the presence of a}} membrane. Crystallization <b>is</b> inherently <b>hard,</b> and NMR studies of membrane proteins can fail because of their size.|$|R

25|$|Abscesses may be {{classified}} as either skin abscesses or internal abscesses. Skin abscesses are common; internal abscesses tend to <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> diagnose, and more serious. Skin abscesses are also called cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses.|$|E
25|$|Some criteria, such as {{economic}} benefit, {{will be more}} easily measurable or definable, while others such as environmental quality will <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> measure or express quantitatively. Ultimately though, the set of decision criteria needs to embody all of the policy goals, and overemphasising the more easily definable or measurable criteria, will have the undesirable impact of biasing the analysis towards {{a subset of the}} policy goals.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} {{also depends}} on the relative strengths of the team's batting and bowling. For instance in Test Cricket, a side with only fast bowlers may choose to bowl first {{to try to take}} advantage of any early moisture in the pitch, knowing that it will <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> take wickets later in the match. Similarly a side with a weak opening batting pair may choose to bowl first in order to protect their batsmen.|$|E
25|$|Photographers {{sometimes}} use {{color temperature}} meters. These are usually designed to read only two regions along the visible spectrum (red and blue); more expensive ones read three regions (red, green, and blue). However, they are ineffective with {{sources such as}} fluorescent or discharge lamps, whose light varies in color and may <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> correct for. Because this light is often greenish, a magenta filter may correct it. More sophisticated colorimetry tools can be used if such meters are lacking.|$|E
25|$|The IRA {{declared}} a brief ceasefire in 1972 {{and a more}} protracted one in 1975, when there was an internal debate over the feasibility of future operations. The armed group reorganised itself in the late 1970s into a smaller, cell-based structure, {{which was designed to}} <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> penetrate. The IRA now tried to carry out a smaller scale but more sustained campaign which they characterised as the 'Long War', with the eventual aim of weakening the British government's resolve to remain in Ireland. The British Army called this the 'terrorist phase' of the IRA's campaign.|$|E

25|$|Keane {{was born}} on 8 July 1980 in Tallaght, Dublin, Republic of Ireland. His parents are Robert and Anne Keane. He started his {{football}} career with local club Fettercairn before joining Dublin schoolboy team Crumlin United {{at the age of}} 10 where his talent was seen and recognised at an early age. Keane received offers from both Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers but decided to go to the First Division side, judging that it would <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> break into the first team at Liverpool. He moved to Wolverhampton four days before his 16th birthday in July 1996, joining their youth team.|$|E
25|$|Speaking at {{a conference}} {{organised}} by The Library Campaign and Voices for the Library he added: The book {{is second only to}} the wheel as the best piece of technology human beings have ever invented. A book symbolises the whole intellectual history of mankind; it's the greatest weapon ever devised in the war against stupidity. Beware of anyone who tries to make books harder to get at. And that is exactly what these closures are going to do – oh, not intentionally, except in a few cases; very few people are stupid intentionally; but that will be the effect. Books will <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> get at. Stupidity will gain a little ground.|$|E
25|$|Porto and its {{surroundings}} {{is the traditional}} area of the francesinha, with many restaurants and cafés serving it. It can also be easily found in several other places across the north of Portugal. In the center and south of Portugal it may <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> find, but there are {{an increasing number of}} restaurants, bars and cafés serving it, especially in tourist destinations like beach resorts ranging from Figueira da Foz to Albufeira. In Lisbon, a number of bars and restaurants serve varied types of francesinha, including variations served with green sauce. Francesinha standard sauce bottles have been sold in supermarkets across the entire country since the 2000s, which may be related with a growth of the sandwich's popularity outside Porto Metropolitan Area.|$|E

25|$|Fannie stock plunged. Some {{worried that}} Fannie lacked capital and might go bankrupt. Others {{worried about a}} {{government}} seizure. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson {{as well as the}} White House went on the air to defend the financial soundness of Fannie Mae, in a last-ditch effort to prevent a total financial panic. Fannie and Freddie underpinned the whole U.S. mortgage market. As recently as 2008, Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) had owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.'s $12 trillion mortgage market. If they were to collapse, mortgages would <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> obtain and much more expensive. Fannie and Freddie bonds were owned by everyone from the Chinese Government, to money market funds, to the retirement funds of hundreds of millions of people. If they went bankrupt there would be mass upheaval on a global scale.|$|E
25|$|The flipper is bowled on the {{opposite}} side to a slider, much {{in the same way that}} the top-spinner is bowled. On release, the bowler 'pinches' or clicks the thumb and forefinger, causing the ball to come out underneath the hand. There must be sufficient tension in the wrist and fingers to impart a good helping of backspin or underspin. In doing so the flipper will float on towards the batsman and land on a fuller length than he anticipated, often leaving him caught on the back foot when he wrongly assumes it to be a pullable or a cuttable ball. The back spin or underspin will cause the ball to hurry on at great pace with very little bounce, though this may <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> achieve on softer wickets. A series of normal leg spinners or topspinners, with their dropping looping flight, will have the batsman used to the ball pitching on a shorter length. The batsman may wrongly assume that the flipper will drop and loop like a normal overspinning delivery, resulting in the ball pitching under the bat and going on to either hit the stumps or result in leg before wicket.|$|E
25|$|A dyad is a two-person group; a triad is a three-person group. In a dyad {{a person}} is able to retain their individuality. There is no other person to shift {{the balance of the}} group thereby {{allowing}} those within the dyad to maintain their individuality. In the triad group there is a possibility of a dyad forming within the triad thereby threatening the remaining individual's independence and causing them to become the subordinate of the group. This seems to be an essential part of society which becomes a structure. Unfortunately as the group (structure) becomes increasingly greater the individual becomes separated and grows more alone, isolated and segmented. Simmel's view was somewhat ambiguous with respect to group size. On one hand he believed that the bigger the group the better for the individual. In a larger group it would <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> exert control on individual, {{but on the other hand}} with a large group there is a possibility of the individual becoming distant and impersonal. Therefore, in an effort for the individual to cope with the larger group they must become a part of a smaller group such as the family.|$|E

For this reason, many AMT systems ignore offsets and only work with onsets.|$|R

Such devices are known as speech generating devices (SGD) or voice output communication aids (VOCA). [...] A device's speech output may be digitized and/or synthesized: digitized systems play recorded words or phrases and are generally more intelligible while synthesized speech uses text-to-speech software that can <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> understand but that permits the user to spell words and speak novel messages.|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} script, the babies {{were born with}} wings instead of tails. While research revealed that such an occurrence was possible, the wings were changed to tails in {{the final version of}} the script because they were not considered cute enough. Gilligan later explained that [...] "tails were just funnier", and also that the wings would <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> add in post-production. The tails were created through computer-generated imagery, with a green mark being painted on the babies' backs as a reference.|$|E

In his brilliant strokeplay {{there was a certain}} courtliness. In his most aggressive innings, there was no brutality; his bat was never used as a bludgeon." [...] E. W. Swanton said that McCabe was from [...] "the heroic mould" [...] and that [...] "like those of Hobbs, Macartney and Woolley were essentially qualitative" [...] and that McCabe [...] "came as near as any player to one’s conception of the perfect cricketer".|$|E
