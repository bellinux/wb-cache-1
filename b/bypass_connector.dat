The {{southern part of the}} avenue serves as a main route between Praia and Cidade Velha in Ribeira Grande and Porto Mosquito (the EN1-ST2) and the whole as a <b>bypass</b> <b>connector</b> with the route connecting Praia and the north of the island (the EN1-ST1) with a roundabout northeast of the plateau along with the Circular Road, the port and the airport. Other streets includes Avenida de China which is the second main street, a small part of Avenida de Cuba, Rua da Várzea which is the third main street, Rua de Sucupira and the old Praia-Cidade Velha Road. Inside the southernmost circle is the monument named Homem de Pedra (Man of Stone).

50|$|Long Island, meanwhile, lobbied {{to extend}} I-495 east over NY 495. The {{extension}} {{took place in}} the early 1980s, at which time the NY 495 signs were taken down and I-495 was extended to the east end of the LIE. The section of I-495 {{in the vicinity of the}} Lincoln Tunnel was redesignated as NY 495 at this time. The extension of I-495 to Riverhead makes the highway a spur, which should have an odd first digit according to the Interstate Highway System's numbering scheme. Even first digits are usually assigned to <b>bypasses,</b> <b>connectors,</b> and beltways, as I-495 was prior to the 1980s. A proposed Long Island Crossing would have extended the LIE across Long Island Sound to I-95 in either Guilford, Connecticut, Old Saybrook, Connecticut, or Rhode Island via a series of existing and man-made islands, but a lack of funding as well as public opposition led to the demise of these proposals.|$|R

40|$|Chapter 1 Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} (CABG) is {{traditionally}} performed via a median sternotomy approach on cardiopulmonary bypass (arrested heart). Since the mid 1990 ties, beating heart, minimally invasive and even totally endoscopic CABG are (re) explored. In all approaches to CABG, the surgeon may face several intraoperative difficulties: 1. 	Localization {{of the target}} coronary artery for bypass grafting. 2. 	Selection of the optimal anastomotic site on the target coronary artery. 3. 	Assessment {{of the quality of}} the constructed anastomosis. An epicardial ultrasound mini-transducer was evaluated to aid in all the intraoperative difficulties described above. Chapter 2 Three devices: 1) a sternum lift for the creation of additional workspace; 2) an EndoStarfish for closed chest exposure of the posterior side of the heart, and; 3) an EndoOctopus for closed chest stabilization of the coronary artery, were employed for closed-chest multivessel robot-assisted beating heart CABG in a porcine model. Chapter 3 & 4 The epicardial ultrasound mini-transducer was used in the model described in chapter 2, in order to endoscopically locate and assess the major target coronary arteries for bypass grafting and assessment of coronary anastomoses. The mini-transducer was introduced through a port and manipulated over the heart using robot-assisted instruments. The ultrasound image was displayed picture-in-picture on the master console of the tele-manipulation system. Robot-assisted scanning enabled endoscopic identification and assessment of the major coronary branches and anastomoses. Chapter 5 & 6 In pressure perfused porcine and human hearts, we investigated the epicardial ultrasound presentation and geometry alteration of specific construction errors in coronary artery anastomoses. Also, the sensitivity and specificity of epicardial ultrasound for the detection of coronary anastomosis construction errors was determined and compared to the gold standard angiography. Using ultrasound construction errors were detected with a sensitivity of 0. 98 and specificity of 1. 00 which is significantly higher than by angiography (0. 75 and 0. 81, respectively). Chapter 7 During application of the S 2 AS distal coronary <b>bypass</b> <b>connector</b> in porcine beating heart CABG, we employed the mini-transducer to evaluate quantitative calliper measurements for vessel size matching and assess the quality of the anastomosis. The external calliper measurements provided a reliable quantitative estimate of vessel diameter for size matching. Epicardial ultrasound enabled intraoperative assessment of the S²AS coronary connector anastomosis in considerable detail. Chapter 8 & 9 The successful initial results of the application of the mini-transducer, on all sides of the arrested heart, in patients undergoing CABG surgery is described. Epicardial scanning resulted in changes of the selected anastomotic site, the number of constructed anastomoses and prevented grafting of the wrong vessel. Subesequently, a study protocol was set-up that will evaluate the relation between intraoperative epicardial ultrasound, pre- and postoperative coronary angiography and postoperative multislice CT scanning, in CABG patients. Chapter 10 The mini-transducer described this thesis, can be used on all sides of the heart, in all approaches currently used for CABG. Epicardial ultrasound helps in (1) locating the target coronary artery, (2) selecting the optimal anastomotic site, (3) assessing the quality of the constructed anastomosis, (4) selecting the optimal site for aortic clamping and cannulation...|$|E
25|$|I-90 was {{assigned}} in 1957 {{as part of}} the establishment of the Interstate Highway System. In New York, it was overlaid on the pre-existing New York State Thruway from Pennsylvania to Albany, from where it would have continued to Massachusetts on a new freeway that <b>bypassed</b> the Berkshire <b>Connector</b> to the north. Ultimately, the freeway was built from the Thruway mainline in Albany to the Berkshire Connector in Schodack, and I-90 {{was assigned}} to the segment of the Connector east of the proposed freeway. The Albany–Schodack freeway was completed in stages during the 1960s and 1970s and fully open by 1977.|$|R
50|$|Numbered {{highways}} in Canada {{are split}} by province, {{and a majority}} are maintained by their province or territory transportation department. All highways in Canada are numbered except for three in the Northwest Territories, one in Alberta, one in Ontario, and one in Quebec. Ontario's 7000 series are not marked with their highway number but have been assigned one by the Ministry of Transportation. A number of highways in all provinces are better known locally by their name rather than their number. Some highways have additional letters added to their number: A is typically an alternate route, B is typically a business route, and other letters are used for <b>bypass</b> (truck) routes, <b>connector</b> routes, scenic routes, and spur routes. The territory of Nunavut has no highways.|$|R
50|$|Knightdale {{is located}} off a {{recently}} completed portion of Interstate 540 {{that connects the}} town to North Raleigh, RDU, the Research Triangle Park, Apex, and Morrisville. Interstate 495, {{also known as the}} Knightdale Bypass, is a six-lane freeway that bypasses the town to ease traffic in eastern Wake County. US 64 and US 264 are also routed on the Knightdale Bypass which travels from Raleigh's Inner Loop (Interstate 440) to the US 64/264 freeway near Zebulon. An interchange with the eastern segment of Raleigh's Outer Loop I-540 opened in January 2007. This interchange makes the Knightdale <b>Bypass</b> a key <b>connector</b> between Raleigh's two loops. US 64 and US 264's previous alignment has been given the designation Business US 64 and Knightdale Boulevard. It travels through the town of Knightdale, ending in the east near Zebulon and in the west at I-440 in Raleigh.|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a biventricular bypass (BVB) {{system for the}} treatment of postcardiotomy ventricular failure. This study investigated the effect of BVB on left ventricular (LV) performance in comparison with venoarterial bypass (VAB) using the LV pressure-volume relationship. Eight adult mongrel dogs (14 ～ 21 kg) underwent VAB with right atrial and femoral arterial cannulation. Left atrial cannulation was added for BVB, and both atrial drainage tubes were joined with a Y-shaped <b>connector.</b> <b>Bypass</b> flow was maintained at half of the baseline cardiac output. A high-fidelity micro-tip catheter and a conductance catheter were used to evaluate LV function. The slope of the LV end-systolic pressure-volume relation (Emax), LV stroke work (SW), LV potential energy (PE), LV pressurevolume area (PVA), the slope of the SW-end-diastolic volume relation (preload recruitable stroke work : PRSW), and the PE/PVA ratio (an index of the LV energy economy) were assessed. Emax showed no significant changes during each experiment. PRSW was reduced by BVB compared with the baseline and with VAB. The PE/PVA ratio only increased significantly during BVB. These results suggested that BVB might provide an effective circulatory support for reducing LV work and improving the LV energy efficiency...|$|R
