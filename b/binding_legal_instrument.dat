40|$|Since {{the launch}} of the first {{artificial}} satellite, Sputnik 1 in 1957, the outer space arena has evolved to include non-state entities, which are becoming serious participants in outer space activities themselves, including venturing into the space tourism market. Although space tourism is still in its infancy, it is estimated that the number of space tourists will substantially increase within the next few years. As space tourist activities increase, accidents will inevitably occur, which will give rise to legal questions relating to the duty of states to rescue space tourists in distress, and the liability for damages. This contribution points out that the current outer space treaty regime, which focuses on the use of outer space by states, is to a large extent outdated and that it cannot adequately deal with the unique legal challenges presented by the rapidly developing space tourism industry. This situation is exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} outer space legal framework is very fragmented – consisting of treaties, UN principles and guidelines, regional regulations and intergovernmental agreements, as well as national guidelines and legislation. In order to ensure that space tourism is indeed to the benefit of all mankind, it is imperative that clear international legal rules relating to space tourism be formulated, where standards are set for the authorisation and supervision of commercial space activities and the interests of states, passengers and private actors are balanced as far as possible. In view of the urgent need to address these legal questions and the consequent lack of time to negotiate a <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>instrument,</b> it is submitted that, as an interim measure, soft law guidelines should be developed in relation to space tourism in order to provide a framework for the 2 eventual creation of a consolidated and <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>instrument</b> on all aspects relating to the use and exploration of outer space...|$|E

40|$|Transboundary haze {{pollution}} {{is a major}} problem that affects the environment and human health of the ASEAN region. In addressing shared environmental problems ASEAN places more reliance on prevention and cooperation than establishing a liability regime or adopting <b>legal</b> <b>instruments</b> to protect the environment. This {{is a reflection of the}} so-called ‘ASEAN Way’, which emphasises non-interference in other states’ domestic affairs, the use of consensus planning and cooperative programs, and a preference for national implementation rather than reliance on a strong region-wide agency or bureaucracy. In addition, the ASEAN preference is for ‘soft’ rather than ‘hard’ law. This article examines the strengths and weaknesses of the current ASEAN regional legal framework for addressing transboundary haze pollution, with particular emphasis on the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution and other haze-related soft law and policy. The authors suggest that the current ASEAN legal framework, particularly the ASEAN Agreement, will not be effective in addressing haze pollution unless there are improvements to the Agreement’s provisions.

40|$|The Sphere Humanitarian Charter, a {{self-regulation}} {{instrument of}} humanitarian non-State actors, establishes principles and minimum {{standards in the}} provision of humanitarian assistance in select vital life-saving relief activities, especially in nutrition and health. The Charter articulates principles and minimum standards for facilitating the achievement of rights and obligations enshrined in various international legal “soft law” instruments. Due to the multiplicity of international legal instruments, the Sphere Charter provides a tool for a coherent understanding and application of relevant obligations, and therefore increases accountability and efficiency. The Sphere Charter's bold human rights based approach to humanitarian assistance, including its articulation of a right to receive humanitarian assistance, may contribute to the evolution of the international legal regime into a more “victim centered” system. The central argument postulated in this article is that although the Sphere Charter is not a <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>instrument,</b> it has significant normative value that may contribute to progressive developments in the legal regime governing humanitarian assistance, and is particularly helpful in improving accountability and quality {{in the provision of}} nutrition and health relief.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{necessity}} to strengthen {{in a way}} or another citizen’s involvement in the political life of the European Union (EU) is an old issue, but the fi rst unsuccessful attempt to introduce it in a treaty, as a <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>instrument,</b> took place in 1992. Since then, the importance of involving the Europeans increased constantly {{taking into account the}} political, economical, and social realities of the 1990 s and 2000 s, which determined the leaders of the Member States of the European Union to fi nd the best “political channels ” to stipulate both in the primary and in the secondary European legislation, as a “blank insurance ” that this right will be offi cially regulated and promoted at the European level. Therefore, this article will examine, on the one hand the evolution of the European citizenship and enshrining the political rights for the Europeans, {{and on the other hand}} will present a brief history of designing this instrument, if the outcome of these political efforts, namely the European Citizens ’ Initiative Regulation (ECI), adopted in 2011, represents, after all, a useful or un-useful instrument to be used by the citizens, having also the belief that this supranational instrument will make the citizens more active in using this right of initiative...|$|E

Indeed, {{the genesis of the}} children’s rights {{movement}} has been largely informed by the efforts to protect working children in the industrial revolution and the work of the International Labour Organisation and labour reformers during the 20 th century.

The introduction to this special issue takes stock of the results twenty years after and finds mixed results. It argues that a supranational EU gender and antidiscrimination regime has developed beyond the original limitations to discrimination {{between women and men}} in employment and social security, thanks to the attention to gender equality in other policy domains and the adoption of <b>legal</b> and political <b>instruments</b> dealing with other grounds for discrimination. However, in spite of feminist activism and research, gender mainstreaming has not fulfilled the expectations as a transformative strategy, and member states have limited the development of an antidiscrimination regime to a set of ever softer policy <b>instruments</b> and two <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>instruments.</b> Importantly, the processes of gender mainstreaming and antidiscrimination remain disconnected institutionally and strategically. Instead of mainstreaming the concept of intersectionality, antidiscrimination policies continue to treat grounds for discrimination separately, gender equality seems to be absorbed by the logic of antidiscrimination as a reactive policy approach, and gender mainstreaming is reduced to inserting woman and man as two fixed categories. Unfortunately, the eastern enlargement, the financial crisis and the legitimacy crisis faced by the EU have created a social and political constellation, which is not propitious for the development of an alternative equality strategy...|$|R

These golden people, who have tremendous contribution towards the gradual development of human civilization, are considered as ‘burden’ in many cases, treated as an ‘object of abuse and neglect’. While core international human rights instruments prohibit any sort of discrimination on the ground of, inter alia, ‘age’, the human rights of these group of people are routinely violated. The serious concern is that the rate of these people has been growing at an unprecedented pace and the United Nations has estimated that the number of these people will reach to 1 billion {{by the end of this}} decade, and 80 % of these people will be from the low-and middle-class income countries.

40|$|How does {{transnational}} {{legal order}} emerge, develop and solidify? This chapter focuses on {{how and why}} actors come to define an issue as one requiring transnational legal intervention of a specific kind. Specifically, we focus on how and why states have increasingly constructed and acceded to international legal norms relating to human trafficking. Empirically, human trafficking {{has been on the}} international and transnational agenda for nearly a century. However, relatively recently – and fairly swiftly in the 2000 s – governments have committed themselves to criminalize human trafficking in international as well as regional and domestic law. Our paper tries to explain this process of norm convergence. We hypothesize that swift convergence on norms against human trafficking and on a particular legal solution – criminalization – {{is the result of a}} specific set of conditions related to globalization and the collapse of the former Soviet Union in the 1990 s. We argue that a broad coalition of states had much to gain by choosing a prosecutorial model over one that makes human rights or victim protection its top priority. We explore the framing of human trafficking through computerized textual analysis of United Nations resolutions – the central forum for debates over the nature of human trafficking and what to do about it. We look for evidence of how the framing of human trafficking has shifted over time, and how the normative pressure as reflected in these documents has waxed and waned. We will argue that a <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>instrument</b> became possible because of the normative convergence solidified by linking human trafficking to transnational crime more generally...|$|E

A survey of {{the output of the}} Court during that time reveals a sharp {{rise in the number of}} cases in which a provision of the Charter was cited or argued before the Court. Further, the Court has engaged substantively with and given prominence to the Charter argument in a growing number of these cases. In other words, the incidence of human rights adjudication before the CJEU has been significantly augmented by the adoption of the Charter as a <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>instrument.</b> The article considers the implications for the Court of Justice of the growing demand for it to function in certain cases as a human rights adjudicator. More particularly, it questions whether the long-standing judicial style and approach of the Court – its self-referential, formulaic and often minimalist style of reasoning – is appropriate to this expanded role. The article argues that the nature and context of the increasing number of human rights claims being made before the Court call for greater openness on the part of the CJEU to the use of international and comparative law and to the possibility of third party interventions. Further, and particularly given the evident unwillingness of the CJEU to countenance the practice of separate concurring or dissenting opinions, the Court should, particularly in cases involving human rights claims, rethink its increasingly frequent practice of dispensing with the opinion of an Advocate General...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Second World War the {{potential}} use of outer space for military purposes persisted to be intrinsically linked to the development of space technology and space flight. The launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, by the USSR in 1957 made Western states realise that a surprise attack from space was a real possibility, resulting in the so-called "space-race" between the USA and the USSR. During the Cold War space activities were intrinsically linked to the political objectives, priorities and national security concerns of the USA and the Soviet Union. After the Cold War the political relevance and benefits of space continued to be recognised by states. In view of the recent emergence of new major space powers such as China, the focus has again shifted to the military use of outer space and {{the potential}} that a state with advanced space technology may use it for military purposes in order to dominate other states. Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty prohibits the installation of nuclear weapons and {{weapons of mass destruction in}} outer space and determines that the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used for peaceful purposes only. Due to the dual-use character of many space assets, the distinction between military and non-military uses of outer space is becoming increasingly blurred. This article discusses a number of legal challenges presented by article IV of the Outer Space Treaty, relating specifically to the term peaceful, the distinction between the terms militarisation and weaponisation and the nature of a space weapon. It is concluded that article IV is in many respects outdated and that it cannot address the current legal issues relating to the military use of outer space. The legal vacuum in this area may have grave consequences not only for maintaining peace and security in outer space, but also on earth. Consequently, an international dialogue on the military uses of outer space should be facilitated under the auspices of the UNCOPUOS to address these uncertainties as a matter of urgency. Although it is agreed with the proponents of a hard law approach that a legally binding instrument should be adopted to regulate the military use of outer space, it is submitted that, as an interim measure, soft law guidelines should be developed to provide a framework for the eventual creation of a consolidated and <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>instrument</b> on all aspects relating to the use of outer space...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the Internet {{has made it possible}} to transfer data ‘around the globe at the click of a mouse’. Especially fresh business models such as cloud computing, the newest driver to illustrate the speed and breadth of the online environment, allow this data to be processed across national borders on a routine basis. A number of factors cause the Internet to blur the lines between public and private space: Firstly, globalization and the outsourcing of economic actors entrain an ever-growing exchange of personal data. Secondly, the security pressure {{in the name of the}} legitimate fight against terrorism opens the access to a significant amount of data for an increasing number of public authorities. And finally,the tools of the digital society accompany everyone at each stage of life by leaving permanent individual and borderless traces in both space and time. Therefore, calls from both the public and private sectors for an international legal framework for privacy and data protection have become louder. Companies such as Google and Facebook have also come under continuous pressure from governments and citizens to reform the use of data. Thus, Google was not alone in calling for the creation of ‘global privacystandards’. Efforts are underway to review established privacy foundation documents. There are similar efforts to look at standards in global approaches to privacy and data protection. The last remarkable steps were the Montreux Declaration, in which the privacycommissioners appealed to the United Nations ‘to prepare a <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>instrument</b> which clearly sets out in detail the rights to data protection and privacy as enforceable human rights’. This appeal was repeated in 2008 at the 30 thinternational conference held in Strasbourg, at the 31 stconference 2009 in Madrid and in 2010 at the 32 ndconference in Jerusalem. In a globalized world, free data flow has become an everyday need. Thus, the aim of global harmonization should be that it doesn’t make any difference for data users or data subjects whether data processing takes place in one or in several countries. Concern has been expressed that data users might seek to avoid privacy controls by moving their operations to countries which have lower standards in their privacy laws or no such laws at all. To control that risk, some countries have implemented special controls into their domestic law. Again, such controls may interfere with the need for free international data flow. A formula has to be found to make sure that privacy at the international level does not prejudice this principle...|$|E
40|$|The Max Planck Institute {{welcomes the}} {{initiative}} of the European Commission for a <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>instrument</b> on collective management of copyright and related rights in the EU. Numerous provisions are to be appreciated (paras 15 and 31). Yet the Commission seems to fail {{to take account of}} the full legal framework and factual circumstances that have structured the current system of collective rights management. Disposing of natural monopolies in a two-sided market (paras 5 - 9), collecting societies (about this terminology, see footnote 2) should not refuse to grant access to their services to rightholders and users. Hence, it is strongly recommended that the European legislature follows the experience of numerous Members States and proposes an obligation to contract with rightholders (para 10) as well as with users (para 11). The critique on the Commission’s approach to cross-border licences for online rights on musical works as set forth in the Recommendation of 2005 (footnote 6) has unfortunately not been duly considered and the Commission’s assessment of the practical effects of the Recommendation is mistaken (paras 9 - 10, 12, 17, 46 et seq.). Differences of substantive copyright law among Member States still constitute an obstacle to the establishment of an internal market for works. This is why the Institute deems the Commission's sectorial approach to the regulation of cross-border licensing to be problematic. Also such regulation would require further harmonisation of substantive copyright law (paras 13, 20 and 25). Moreover, the Proposal fails to take account of statutory remuneration rights and cases of mandatory collective management (see paras 14, 18 and 36). Both pursue specific protection of original rightholders. In this regard the Proposal’s refusal to distinguish between different categories of rightholders raises concerns (paras 15 - 18, 28, 55). Since collecting societies manage copyrights and related rights arising from national law, and considering the benefits of an authorisation system (paras 57 and 69 et seq.), which can be found in several Member States, the Institute advises the European legislature to clearly state that the intellectual property exception of article 17 (11) of the Service Directive applies to collecting societies (paras 19 - 24). The Proposal endangers the balance both between different categories of rightholders and between rightholders and users that the established system of collective management of copyright in Europe traditionally seeks to achieve (see paras 32 - 45, 64). It thereby compromises the laudable goal to foster the establishment of an internal market for online uses of works across Europe (paras 12, 26, 46 - 65) ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the status of}} amnesties and the duty to prosecute gross and systematic human rights violations in international law. The thesis begins by distinguishing amnesty from other related concepts, such as impunity, pardon and statutes of limitations and so on. Unlike these related concepts, amnesty aims to address major social or political crises in society, such as to resolve an armed conflict, allow the return of political refugees or bring about peaceful political transition. Amnesty {{is linked to the}} duty to prosecute, because it is so often in direct conflict with international law norms and standards on the duty to prosecute and to compensate victims of human rights violations. Before the First World War, amnesty was a well-established customary practice. Even where a peace treaty was silent on the mater, amnesty was implied. Compensation was also part of the regime of peace treaties, but not followed as consistently as amnesty. This practice changed dramatically after the First and Second World Wars, because, in a break with the past, the victors did not consider themselves {{to be on the same}} level as the vanquished. This resulted in the abolition of the traditional practice of granting amnesty and the demand rather that those responsible for aggression be prosecuted and compelled to pay compensation, as was the case with Germany. Since 1948, with the adoption of the United Nations' Charter, and other international human rights treaties, the power of states to grant amnesty gradually became constrained by the obligation to prosecute perpetrators of gross human rights violations and to pay compensation to the victims of war crimes. Nevertheless, this phenomenon did not put an end to the practice of states granting amnesty for gross human rights violations. Internal armed conflicts during and after the end of the Cold War, with no victors and no vanquished, made amnesty an inevitable option. A considerable number of states continue to utilise amnesty as a device for peace and reconciliation, and they have granted amnesty for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. In customary international law, there is a gap between the actual state practice and the existence of the customary norm creating a duty to prosecute. As a result, the status of the so-called "palatable amnesties" (à la South Africa), often granted as part of a truth and reconciliation process, still remains unclear in international law. This is further exacerbated by the inconsistent practice of the United Nations as the main depository and sponsor of human rights instruments. South Africa and Sierra Leone are used as case studies to illustrate this inconsistency in both state and UN practice on the status of amnesties in international law. As a result, the study proposes a balanced approach model, which is an attempt to strike a balance between accountability, political transformation and social stability in transitional democracies. The balanced approach model proceeds from the premise that the international criminal justice system is not flawless and, therefore, it is important to acknowledge its limitations, such as the lack of enforcement agencies, difficulties in the collection of reliable evidence and a lack of resources to prosecute. In terms of the model, consideration is given to (i) the need to respect the legitimacy of the political process that gives rise to the granting of amnesty; (ii) the amnesty must be proportional to the crimes committed and must be rationally connected to the aims of achieving peace and national reconciliation, the interests of justice, compensation for victims; and finally (iii) the general commitment of the state that grants amnesty to respect international law obligations, which includes the implementation of international obligations as part of municipal law and treaty monitoring obligations as preconditions for the amnesty to pass muster in the balanced approach model. In conclusion, the study proposes model Policy Guidelines on Amnesties Granted for Gross and Systematic Human Rights Violations in International Law for the Assembly of States of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to take note of, and to commend to states and international courts and tribunals, leaving its content to be taken up in the normal processes of the application and development of international law. The status of the Guidelines is that of a code of conduct or guide to practice. In that sense, the Guidelines do not have the character of a <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>instrument</b> and will serve as the basis for the development of sound principles of international law on amnesties.
