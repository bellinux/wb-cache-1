40|$|BACKGROUND: Nebivolol is {{a highly}} {{selective}} <b>beta-adrenoreceptor</b> <b>antagonist</b> with vasodilating properties. This study investigated its effect on quality of life (QoL) and blood pressure (BP) in real life conditions. In total, 1468 patients were enrolled, 12 % diabetics. Nebivolol was prescribed as monotherapy, add-on or switch medication. METHODS: In this open-label, prospective study, the JNC-VII BP target values were used: < 140 / 90 and < 130 / 80 mmHg for diabetics. The responder rate and the QoL was determined at baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks. RESULTS: After 4 weeks, 27 % of subjects reached target BP, 45 % after 8 weeks. The responder rates were 92, 90 and 83 % for the monotherapy, add-on and switch groups. Compared with baseline, all showed statistical significance at 8 weeks. Similarly to results for the QoL after 8 weeks, the mean improvement in QoL for all three groups was 9 - 10 points (total range: 0 - 88). CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that nebivolol in mild to moderate hypertension is associated with overall improvements in QoL, with a marked BP-lowering effect, in monotherapy, add-on or switch, irrespective of the glucose tolerance status. It may be hypothesized that its dual mode of action explains its BP-lowering effect {{as well as the}} tolerability...|$|E
40|$|Fuel {{substrate}} utilization {{is highly}} regulated during cardiac development {{and with the}} onset of cardiac hypertrophy. Glucose and lactate are the predominant fuel substrates utilized during cardiac development. Postnatally, a switch occurs so that fatty acids become the chief energy substrate in the nonfed adult mammalian heart. A reversion back towards fetal energy metabolism occurs with the development of cardiac hypertrophy. To evaluate the role of this substrate preference switch in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, the molecular regulation directing these switches is being explored. Thus, we have begun by defining the temporal expression patterns of genes encoding key rate-controlling enzymes directing major fuel substrate metabolism during cardiac development, with pressure-overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, and following antihypertensive therapy in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The genes encoding the fatty acid and adult enriched rate-controlling glycolytic enzymes are expressed at low levels in the fetal and neonatal rat heart. The genes encoding these enzymes are significantly and coordinately upregulated (> or = 70 %) in adult rat hearts compared to the fetal expression patterns. A reciprocal and coordinate downregulation (> or = 40 % reduction) of the fatty acid and adult enriched glycolytic enzyme encoding genes are observed with the induction of pressure-overload-induced hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats compared to Wistar-Furth normotensive control rats. Antihypertensive therapy with carvedilol, a vasodilating alpha- and <b>beta-adrenoreceptor</b> <b>antagonist,</b> attenuates this reversion of the metabolic gene expression pattern towards fetal levels compared to placebo-treated littermate controls. This coordinate developmental and hypertrophy-induced regulation of genes that encode enzymes controlling both fatty acid and glycolytic catabolic pathways in the heart implicates potential mutual/overlapping regulatory signaling proteins within their gene regulatory programs. These gene regulatory pathways need to be identified and modulated in order to characterize the functional role of fuel substrate metabolism in cardiac development and with the induction of cardiac hypertrophy...|$|E

Conformational analysis of 1 - 3 and the oxazolidine derivatives 4 - 7 has been performed using H- 1 NMR spectroscopy and computational methods.

Thus, oxazolidine ring formation does not dramatically alter the preferred conformation adopted by the beta-amino alcohol moiety of 1 - 3.

40|$|Increased {{activity}} of the noradrenergic system in the amygdala has been suggested {{to contribute to the}} hyperarousal symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, only two studies have examined the content of noradrenaline or its metabolites in the amygdala of rats previously exposed to traumatic stress showing inconsistent results. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of an inescapable foot shock (IFS) procedure (1) on reactivity to novelty in an open-field (as an index of hyperarousal), and (2) on noradrenaline release in the amygdala during an acute stress. To test the role of noradrenaline in amygdala, we also investigated the effects of microinjections of propranolol, a <b>beta-adrenoreceptor</b> <b>antagonist,</b> and clenbuterol, a beta-adrenoreceptor agonist, into the amygdala of IFS and control animals. Finally, we evaluated the expression of mRNA levels of beta-adrenoreceptors (beta 1 and beta 2) in the amygdala, the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. Male Wistar rats (3 months) were stereotaxically implanted with bilateral guide cannulae. After recovering from surgery, animals were exposed to IFS (10 shocks, 0. 86 mA, and 6 s per shock) and seven days later either microdialysis or microinjections were performed in amygdala. Animals exposed to IFS showed a reduced locomotion compared to non-shocked animals during the first 5 min in the open-field. In the amygdala, IFS animals showed an enhanced increase of noradrenaline induced by stress compared to control animals. Bilateral microinjections of propranolol (0. 5 mug) into the amygdala one hour before testing in the open-field normalized the decreased locomotion observed in IFS animals. On the other hand, bilateral microinjections of clenbuterol (30 ng) into the amygdala of control animals did not change the exploratory activity induced by novelty in the open field. IFS modified the mRNA expression of beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoreceptors in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. These results suggest that an increased noradrenergic activity in the amygdala contributes to the expression of hyperarousal in an animal model of PTSD...|$|E
40|$|C. N. S. -induced {{suppression}} of muscle Na-pump activity was studied in fast 'twitch' muscle, extensor digitorum longus, of hypokalaemic rats which were fed a K-deficient diet for 0 - 9 weeks. The results {{were compared with}} those of slow 'tonic' muscle, soleus, reported previously. K-deficient diet caused blood hypokalaemia and a considerable K+ loss and Na+ accumulation in the skeletal, heart and smooth muscles. The cellular K+ loss was in the order of soleus greater than extensor digitorum longus greater than diaphragm greater than duodenum greater than auricle greater than ventricle; C. N. S. organs such as cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, spinal cord and liver were spared this K+ fall. Skeletal, heart and smooth muscles lost more K+ with prolongation of hypokalaemic periods, whereas plasma K+ concentration did not fall much below 1. 6 mM during hypokalaemia. Peripheral nerve section, cervical and brain-stem transection, decerebration and cortical spreading depression with 20 % KCl, which activated the active Na+ and K+ transport in soleus muscles during hypokalaemia, could not enhance the pump activity in extensor digitorum longus muscles. Alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists such as phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine and dibenamine and a specific blocker of post-synaptic alpha 1 -adrenoreceptor, prazosin, did not stimulate Na+ and K+ transport in the extensor digitorum longus muscles during hypokalaemia while the <b>beta-adrenoreceptor</b> <b>antagonist,</b> propranolol, also had no effect. The sensitivity of the active Na+ and K+ transport system in rat muscles to ouabain applied intraperitoneally was greater in extensor digitorum longus muscles than in soleus muscles. The binding experiment with a radiolabelled ligand of alpha 1 adrenoreceptor antagonist, [3 H]prazosin, demonstrated the presence of alpha 1 -adrenergic receptors on the soleus muscle membranes of hypokalaemic rats, but not of normal rats. alpha 1 Adrenergic receptors were not detected on the extensor digitorum longus muscle membranes prepared from either hypokalaemic or normal rats. The correlation between the C. N. S. -induced inhibition on the Na pump in soleus muscle during hypokalaemia and the occurrence of alpha 1 adrenergic receptors on the muscle was discussed...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{descriptions}} of the mechanical restitution curve as a description of variability in ventricular performance with coupling interval in isolated tissue preparations are widely available. In humans, however, in vivo examination of the force-interval relationship is restricted to test pulse intervals shorter than the sinus cycle length (i. e., incomplete mechanical restitution). The primary objectives in this investigation were therefore to examine this aspect of mechanical restitution in patients with ischemic heart disease {{and to develop a}} quantitative description of the phenomenon. Mechanical restitution curves were constructed in 40 patients, most of whom had well-preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function, undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization for the investigation of chest pain, using a single premature test pulse interval during baseline atrial pacing. The mechanical restitution curve, the relationship between LV + dP/dtmax and test pulse interval, was fitted to a rectangular hyperbolic function. From this, the parameter c, the calculated proportional decrease in LV + dP/dtmax at 60 % of the resting cycle length, was derived. The mechanical restitution curve-fitting model (involving determination of c) satisfactorily described the force-interval relationship in 37 of the 40 patients studied (as a rectangular hyperbola in 31 and with simple linear regression in 6 patients). The refractory period of the atria/atrioventricular node limited accurate use of the model in the remaining three patients. The parameter c was inversely proportional to both baseline atrial pacing cycle length (P <. 001) and LV ejection fraction (P <. 02) In patients with normal LV ejection fractions, the derived value of c at a cycle length of 800 ms (c 800) was 29. 0 % baseline LV + dP/dtmax (95 % confidence interval, 23. 0, 35. 0). The presence of hemodynamically significant ischemic heart disease was not a predictor of the parameters of the model. After intravenous injection of the <b>beta-adrenoreceptor</b> <b>antagonist</b> metoprolol in seven patients, there was a significant (P <. 05) reduction in both c and LV + dP/dtmax at the baseline atrial pacing cycle length. Thus, the force-interval relationship can be quantitatively studied using incomplete mechanical restitution curves in humans in vivo. This quantitative description probably reflects relative intracellular calcium availability via slow channel activity and can be used to assess effects of cardioactive drugs on frequency-dependent inotropic mechanisms in humans. The predictive value of this mechanical restitution curve model for hemodynamic instability during tachycardia in patients with impaired LV function remains to be determined. R. H. Ritchie, R. D.

Only sotalol proved superior to placebo on both subjective and "objective" assessments. Metoprolol and sotalol produced comparable degrees of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonism as judged by the blockade of standing tachycardia. Atenolol, in the dose used, produced a trend towards a greater cardiac chronotropic effect. These findings provide no support for the concept that central or peripheral beta 1 -adrenoreceptor mechanisms are important in essential tremor. The beneficial effect of <b>beta-adrenoreceptor</b> <b>antagonists</b> may be mediated predominantly through peripheral beta 2 -adrenoreceptor mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|METOPROLOL is {{a widely}} used beta-adrenoreceptor an-tagonist. To our knowledge, there is no report of {{hepatitis}} involving this drug {{as well as other}} <b>beta-adrenoreceptor</b> <b>antagonists</b> (1). Metoprolol is metabolized by three ma-jor oxidation pathways (2); two of them, O-dealkylation and alpha-hydroxylation, undergo genetically controlled polymorphisms correlated with that of debrisoquine oxi-dation (2 - 4). This finding strongly suggests that meto-prolol oxidation depends at least partly on the same iso-zyme of cytochrome P- 450 involved in the genetic polymorphism of oxidation of debrisoquine and many other drugs such as sparteine, perhexiline, and several other <b>beta-adrenoreceptor</b> <b>antagonists</b> (5). Poor metabo-lizers of debrisoquine and metoprolol exhibit abnormal pharmacokinetics of metoprolol, which can result in an overdose after the administration of a standard dose (3, 4). There is a clear association between impairment of debrisoquine oxidation and susceptibility to develop liver injury with perhexiline (6). It would be interesting to determine whether such an association exists for meto-prolol. We report the first case of hepatitis induced by metoprolol and the result of drug oxidation phenotyping.

40|$|The {{renin-angiotensin system}} (RAS) plays an {{important}} role in the regulation of arterial blood pressure and water and salt regulation. Until recently this system was considered to be exclusively a circulating endocrine system. Circulating renin, released by the renal juxtaglomerular cells, reacts with hepatically derived angiotensinogen (renin substrate) to form the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang 1). Ang I, in turn, is converted to the biologically active octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) which is bound to the endothelial cell membrane. Ang II formed in the circulation diffuses to the tissues where it stimulates specific receptors on the surface of vascular smooth muscle cells as well as on the surface of the aldosterone-producing cells in the adrenal glands. More recent evidence, however, suggests that, in addition to the circulating endocrine RAS, there exist local or tissue renin-angiotensin systems in which Ang I and Ang II are formed in the tissues ratherthan in the circulation. Tissue production of these peptides may be catalyzed either by locally synthesized renin and renin substrate or by renin and renin substrate that are taken up from the plasma. Local renin-angiotensin systems have both autocrine and paracrinefunctions. Messenger RNA (mRNA) for renin has been demonstrated not only in the kidney but also in such organs as the adrenals, ovaries, testes, and brain, and mRNA for angiotensinogen has been found in all of these tissues as well. On the other hand, renin in the heart and blood vessel wall probably originates mainly in the kidneys and is then taken up from the circulation. Human plasma contains not only renin but also its enzymatically inactive precursor prorenin. Virtually all plasma renin is derived from the kidney, as evidenced by the observation that circulating renin levels are extremely low or not demonstrable in anephric patients. The kidney is also an important source of circulating prorenin. However the finding that anephric patients have plasma prorenin levels that are 30 - 40 % of normal indicates that a proportion of circulating prorenin is clearly of extrarenal origin. It is likely that such organs as the adrenals, testes, and ovaries release not renin but prorenin into the circulation. For example, the increased plasma prorenin levels seen in pregnant women are largely derived from the ovaries. Unlike plama renin, plasma prorenin is increased in patients with diabetes mellitus who have microvascular complications. The mechanisms that account for the elevations in plasma prorenin levels seen in these patients are yet unknown. In patients receiving a <b>beta-adrenoreceptor</b> <b>antagonist</b> (beta-blocker), plasma renin levels fall and plasma prorenin levels rise. Thus, it has been proposed that the development of autonomic neuropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus may be responsible for the increase in plasma pro renin. Loss of sympathetic stimulation ofthe beta-adrenoreceptors on the juxtaglomerular cells might result in diminished secretion of renin and, as a compensatory mechanism, the synthesis and secretion of prorenin in the juxtaglomerular apparatus might be augmented According to an alternative hypothesis, when the juxtaglomerular cells are affected by diabetic micrangiopathy, conversion of prorenin to renin in these cells decreases and secretion of prorenin consequently increase...|$|E
40|$|Dysregulation of the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC) is {{believed}} to significantly impact blood pressure. Recent studies have implicated overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system as a mechanism driving renal NCC dysregulation to evoke the development of salt-sensitive hypertension. It is proposed that the sympathetic nervous system accomplishes this by norepinephrine (NE) -mediated over-activation of the beta 2 -adrenergic receptors located in the distal tubules of the kidney. Beta 2 -adrenoreceptor activation is hypothesized to stimulate the protein kinases SPAK and OxSR 1 to phosphorylate and thus activate NCC. This beta 2 -receptor-SPAK/OxSR 1 -NCC pathway was elucidated in studies that challenged salt-resistant mice with high-salt diets, bilateral adrenalectomies, and NE infusion. To expand the scope of these studies, we investigated the effects of elevated circulating NE on blood pressure, NCC activity, and expression of NCC proteins, SPAK, and OxSR 1 in a different salt-resistant animal species (the Sprague-Dawley rat). 	In this study we implanted male Sprague-Dawley rats with osmotic minipumps delivering a subcutaneous infusion of either saline, NE, a 50 : 50 solution of DMSO/isotonic saline, a combination of NE and the NCC antagonist hydrochlorothiazide, {{or a combination of}} NE and the <b>beta-adrenoreceptor</b> <b>antagonist</b> propranolol. Following implantation of the pumps the rats were randomly assigned to either a standard diet (0. 4 % NaCl) or a high-salt diet (8 % NaCl) for two weeks. After fourteen days all animals underwent acute femoral artery, vein, and bladder cannulation in order to monitor heart rate and blood pressure, administer drugs intravenously, and track renal function, respectively. Following surgical recovery, blood pressure and heart rate were measured continuously, and urine was collected in ten-minute intervals in order to assess peak natriuretic responses to amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide. Following this protocol the rats received an intravenous bolus of hexamethonium (30 mg/kg), and their peak drops in blood pressure were recorded. Afterwards both kidneys were harvested and frozen at - 80 °C for measurement of NCC proteins, SPAK, and OxSR 1 expression. 	This study demonstrates that increased circulating NE induces salt-sensitive hypertension in the naturally salt-resistant Sprague-Dawley rat. Chronic infusion of NE raised the blood pressure of the rats, and a high-salt diet exacerbated this effect. Furthermore, NE prevented salt-evoked suppression of NCC activity and NCC, SPAK, and OxSR 1 protein expression. Co-infusion of hydrochlorothiazide with NE attenuated NE-mediated hypertension and caused no variance in the blood pressures between the standard salt and high-salt groups. This indicates that chronically antagonizing NCC eliminated the salt-sensitive component of NE-mediated hypertension. Beta-receptor antagonism combined with NE infusion completely eliminated the hypertensive influence of NE and downregulated the expression of NCC proteins, SPAK, and OxSR 1. However, NCC activity still remained at a level comparable with that observed in the NE-infused rats, demonstrating dissociation between protein expression and function. 	These data, the first report in a rat model of an interaction of NE and a high salt intake that impairs NCC function, demonstrate that increased levels of NE in combination with a high dietary salt intake result in NCC dysregulation and the development of NE-mediated salt-sensitive hypertension. To an extent the data also support the proposition that NE activates the beta-adrenergic receptors to influence the activity of NCC and the expression of NCC proteins, SPAK, and OxSR 1. Beta-antagonism combined with NE infusion attenuated the effects of NE on blood pressure and the expression of NCC proteins, SPAK, and OxSR 1. However, the NE-mediated elevation of NCC activity still remained high. We propose that the beta-receptors are not the only adrenergic receptors that can influence NCC activity. The presence of alpha-adrenergic receptors in the distal tubules suggests that {{they may be able to}} keep NCC activity elevated through a pathway independent of the beta-receptors, SPAK, and OxSR 1...|$|E

These results indicate that essential tremor can be reduced but not blocked, by the adrenergic blocker timolol with both beta 1 and beta 2 blocking properties; but not by the relatively selective beta 1 blocking drug atenolol.

The trial was originally planned to include 4000 patients treated {{for at least a}} year but had to be terminated prematurely because of the serious oculocutaneous and peritoneal reactions reported elsewhere. Nevertheless, important findings, probably applicable to other <b>beta-adrenoreceptor</b> <b>antagonists,</b> have emerged in relation to mortality and morbidity. (1) The practolol-treated group showed a significant reduction in overall mortality and in sudden deaths; (2) there was a highly significant reduction in "all cardiac events"; (3) the reduction in overall mortality was virtually confined to patients whose original pre-entry infarcts were sited anteriorly; (4) the protective effect of practolol was most evident in those patients with pre-entry anterior infarcts whose blood pressures at entry were below the mean for the trial as a whole; (5) there were highly significant group differences in favour of the drug relating to the incidence of angina pectoris and cardiac arrhythmias, and to the numbers of patients who had to be withdrawn from the trial because of these conditions; (6) significantly more patients were withdrawn from the treatment group because of suspected adverse reactions. It is concluded that practolol used in the long-term treatment of patients who have survived the acute phase of myocardial infarction reduces the death rate when the original infarct is sited anteriorly. It is postulated that the favourable results of the trial were due to beta-adrenoreceptor blockade rather than to some other property specific to practolol itself. Since practolol produces severe side effects in long-term use it is recommended that an alternative beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent should be used...|$|R
