The spin- 1 / 2 square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet provides a simple example showing spontaneous breaking of SU(2) symmetry down to U(1).

These changes make Polythiophenes attractive sensors. They are also used in the LED display and semiconductor fields. The aim of this project is to device and document the possibility of a more cost efficient and environment friendly method of dimerization of thiophene for polythiophene synthesis- oxidative coupling. Optimal reaction conditions will be determined for the oxidative coupling. It will be tried to replace HMPV (the traditional catalyst) with a more chemically benign catalyst. In comparison to the Suzuki Reaction or the Grignard Metathesis, which are the most common methods of polythiophene synthesis present today, oxidative coupling produces hydrogen peroxide which decomposes to hydrogen and oxygen as chemical waste. As a result, oxidative coupling is environmentally friendly, and the non-toxic waste is cheaper to dispose of. In reactions involving the formation of a carbon-carbon bond between two organic molecules, the carbons in question have to be activated by a functional group (halides being a common functional group used to do this) to an intermediate product before being used in the final reaction.

Herein we investigate the electrochemical switch on-off {{response of}} a SAM of 6 -(ferrocenyl, FC) hexanethiol (C 6 —FC) upon exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the most common fluorosurfactant. FC is employed as a redox probe to monitor the switch on-off response of the SAM formed on gold electrode surface. In an effort to understand the hydrophilic terminate group's influence from the surfactant, we dope the pristine C 6 —FC SAM with 6 -amino- 1 -hexanethiol (C 6 —NH 2), 1 -hexanethiol (C 5 —CH 3), or 6 -mercaptohexanoic acid (C 5 —COOH) via a thiol-gold <b>bond.</b> We also <b>dope</b> it with 1 -dodecanethiol (C 11 —CH 3) or 12 -mercaptododecanoic acid (C 11 –COOH) to investigate the length effect of the carbon chain. We observe there is a similar switch on-off response either from the presence of PFOA or from the doping C 5 —COOH/C 11 –COOH, suggesting the insertion of PFOA into the C 6 —FC SAM, which is also evidenced by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) and Raman spectrum. This research paves the way towards the development of an electrochemical sensor and an approach for remediation of the fluorosurfactants...|$|R
40|$|Superconductivity up to 30 K {{in charge}} {{neutrally}} doped BaFe 2 [As(1 -x) P(x) ] 2 has been ascribed to chemical pressure, {{caused by the}} shrinking unit cell. But the latter induces no superconductivity in [Ba(1 -x) Sr(x) ]Fe 2 As 2 {{in spite of the}} same volume range. We show that the spin-density-wave (SDW) state of BaFe 2 As 2 becomes suppressed in BaFe 2 [As(1 -x) P(x) ] 2 by a subtle reorganization of the crystal structure, where arsenic and phosphorus are located at different coordinates z(As), z(P). High-resolution X-ray diffraction experiments with BaFe 2 [As(1 -x) P(x) ] 2 single crystals reveal almost unchanged Fe-P bonds, but a contraction of the Fe-As bonds, which remain nearly unchanged in [Ba(1 -x) Sr(x) ]Fe 2 As 2. Since the Fe-As bond length is a gauge for the magnetic moment, our results show why the SDW is suppressed by P-, but not by Sr-doping. Only the Fe-P interaction increases the width of the iron 3 d bands, which destabilizes the magnetic SDW ground state. The simultaneous contraction of the Fe{As bonds is rather a consequence of the vanishing magnetism. Ordered structure models of BaFe 2 [As(1 -x) P(x) ] 2 obtained by DFT calculations agree perfectly with the single-crystal X-ray structure determinations. The contraction of the Fe-As <b>bonds</b> saturates at <b>doping</b> levels above x = 0. 3, which corrects the unreasonable linear decrease of the so-called pnictide height.

40|$|CeO 2 -SnO 2 solid {{solution}} {{has been reported}} to possess high oxygen storage/release property which possibly originates from local structural distortion. We have performed first-principles based density functional calculations of Ce 1 -xSnxO 2 structure (x= 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1) to understand its structural stability in fluorite in comparison to rutile structure of the other end-member SnO 2, and studied the local structural distortion induced by the dopant Sn ion. Analysis of relative energies of fluorite and rutile phases of CeO 2, SnO 2, and Ce 1 -xSnxO 2 indicates that fluorite structure is the most stable for Ce 1 -xSnxO 2 {{solid solution}}. An analysis of local structural distortions reflected in phonon dispersion show that SnO 2 in fluorite structure is highly unstable while CeO 2 in rutile structure is only weakly unstable. Thus, Sn in Ce 1 -xSnxO 2 -fluorite structure is associated with high local structural distortion whereas Ce in Ce 1 -xSnxO 2 -rutile structure, if formed, will show only marginal local distortion. Determination of M-O (M=Ce or Sn) bond lengths and analysis of Born effective charges for the optimized structure of Ce 1 -xSnxO 2 show that local coordination of these cations changes from ideal eightfold coordination expected of fluorite lattice to 4 + 4 coordination, leading to generation of long and short Ce-O and Sn-O <b>bonds</b> in the <b>doped</b> structure. <b>Bond</b> valence analyses for all ions show the presence of oxygen with bond valence similar to 1. 84. These weakly bonded oxygen ions are relevant for enhanced oxygen storage/release properties observed in Ce 1 -xSnxO 2 solid solution. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
