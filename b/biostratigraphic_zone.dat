50|$|A biochron (from the Greek bios, life; and khronos, time) is {{the length}} of time {{represented}} by a <b>biostratigraphic</b> <b>zone.</b> Biochrons are named after characteristic fossil organisms or taxa that characterise that interval in time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{basic unit}} of biochronology is the <b>biostratigraphic</b> <b>zone,</b> or biozone, a {{collection}} of fossils found together in a rock unit. This is {{used as the basis}} of a biochron, [...] "a unit of time in which an association of taxa is interpreted to have lived." [...] However, a biozone may vary in age from one location or another. For example, a given taxon may migrate, so its first appearance varies from place to place. In particular, facies-controlled organisms (organisms that lived in a particular sedimentary environment) are not well suited for biochronology because they move with their environment and may change little over long periods of time. Thus, biostratigraphers search for species that are particularly widespread, abundant, and not tied to particular sedimentary environments. This is particularly true of free-swimming animals such as benthic foraminifera, which readily spread throughout the world's oceans.|$|E
40|$|Strata in the Canadian Arctic contain {{diverse and}} {{moderately}} well-preserved Late Cretaceous siliceous microfossil assemblages. One-hundred-twelve samples were analyzed from a composite stratigraphic section (1094 m-thick) of the Smoking Hills, Mason River and Kanguk formations. Four sections were examined: (1) Slidre Fjord on Ellesmere Island; (2) Hoodoo Dome on Ellef Ringnes Island; (3) Cape Nares on Eglinton Island; and (4) Horton River on the Anderson Plains, Northwest Territories. Two hundred- three diatom taxa {{were identified in}} forty-nine productive samples. Four Upper Cretaceous diatom zones are proposed for the Canadian Arctic based on the biostratigraphic distribution of diatoms: (i) the Upper Cenomanian to Upper Santonian(?) Gladius antiques Concurrent Range Zone, (ii) the Lower Campanian Costopyxis antique Partial Range Zone, (iii) the lower Upper Campanian Trinacria indefinite Interval Zone, and (iv) the upper Upper Campanian Stephanopyxis simonseni Partial Range Zone. The diatom assemblages {{are similar to those}} of Alpha Ridge (Arctic Ocean), Ural Mountains (Russia), and Campbell Plateau (SW Pacific Ocean), enabling diatom-based biostratigraphical correlations within the northern high-latitudes and to the southern high-latitudes. Afifth <b>biostratigraphic</b> <b>zone,</b> Azpeitiopsis morenoensis Concurrent Range Zone, is also proposed, based on common and widespread distribution of the nominative taxon in lower to upper Maastrichtian sediments. Sufficient data is now available to establish the construction of a diatom-based standard zonal framework for the Upper Cretaceous.

40|$|The Tiffanian North American land-mammal age is an {{informal}} biochronologic unit that spans 4. 5 myr {{of the middle}} and late Paleocene. It is preceded and succeeded by the Torrejonian and Clarkforkian land-mammal ages, respectively. The Tiffanian was initially based on a small collection of mammals from southern Colorado, but faunas of Tiffanian age are now known throughout the Rocky Mountain region. The richest and most complete sequence of middle and late Tiffanian faunas known occurs in the northern Bighorn Basin. These faunas are the primary basis for regional Tiffanian biochronology. The Bighorn Basin sequence is also important because it preserves the only known detailed record of faunal change across the Tiffanian-Clarkforkian boundary, which is marked by the first appearance of rodents in North America. Geomagnetic polarity reversals, a carbon isotope excursion marking the Paleocene-Eocene boundary, and a recent Ar 40 /Ar 39 age from a volcanic ash provide a strong geochronologic framework for the faunal sequence. Thus, this record affords a unique window into the evolution of North American mammals that can be compared globally with other biotic, paleoecological, and paleoclimatic records. In spite {{of the importance of}} this Tiffanian record, numerous mammalian species represented by fossils collected over the last seventy-five years have not been described and the variability of many other species is poorly documented. This is especially true of small-bodied mammals. To remedy this, a compendium of Tiffanian and early Clarkforkian mammals that occur in the Bighorn Basin is presented. Most specimens are curated at the University of Michigan, but selected specimens curated at the Yale-Peabody Museum, originally collected by Princeton University crews, are also included. Seventeen new mammalian species are diagnosed and named, including two Leptictidae, two Pantolestidae, six Lipotyphla, one Plagiomenidae, four plesiadapiform Primates, and two Arctocyonidae. A new arctocyonid genus is also named. In addition, the size and morphologic variability of numerous others species is documented. The stratigraphic occurrences of all Tiffanian and early Clarkforkian species known from the Bighorn Basin are documented, and the faunal content of each <b>biostratigraphic</b> <b>zone</b> is summarized. This serves as the basis for a recently revised biostratigraphic zonation of the Tiffanian, and is intended to aid future studies of mammalian biochronology and evolution. Changes in mammalian diversity (species richness) from the middle to the late Paleocene are compared with changes in global climate, inferred from the marine oxygen isotope record. The diversity record of the Bighorn Basin was combined with that of the Crazy Mountains Basin of Montana, since some temporal intervals are better represented in the latter. Localities were divided into clay-gall quarries, mudstone quarries, and surface collections. The number of individuals per species was estimated for each biozone or quarry, and the number of species was then normalized for sample size using rarefaction. Results indicate that species richness decreased from the Torrejonian to the early Tiffanian, reached a low point in the middle Tiffanian, and then began a steady increase to the middle Clarkforkian. The richness curve mirrors the marine temperature curve. Richness is significantly correlated with temperature suggesting that temperature had an important influence on the species diversity of Paleocene faunas...|$|E

25|$|Russell also {{published}} additional information and speculation on mosasaur biostratigraphy. He reported {{the presence of}} mosasaur vertebrae up to 90 million years old among the Turonian fossils curated by the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History. Another of this work's significant contributions to mosasaur biostratigraphy concerned the mosasaurs of the Smoky Hill Chalk. Russell devised two <b>biostratigraphic</b> <b>zones</b> based on the Chalk's mosasaur fossils. The lower zone was characterized by Clidastes liodontus, Platecarpus coryphaeus, and Tylosaurus nepaeolicus. The upper was home to Clidastes, Platecarpus ictericus, and Tylosaurus proriger. He regarded Platecarpus and Tylosaurus as deep water animals but concluded that the biostratigraphic evidence from the Smoky Hill mosasaurs suggested that the Chalk's depositional environment was becoming shallower and nearer to the ancient coastline over time. Russell also argued {{that by the end}} of the Late Cretaceous, mosasaurs were converging on the body plan that characterized the first ichthyosaurs during the Triassic period and gradually replacing these older marine reptiles.|$|R

As the world’s hydrocarbon basins mature, {{most of its}} subsurface uncertainties lie at reservoir scale, {{hence the}} need for a change of strategy in the application of biostratigraphy. This gave rise to “production biostratigraphy, ” where biostratigraphy can play a role in reservoir characterization, correlation, and well site operations. To apply this technique, field specific bioevents are determined and tested for consistency. North Sea applications resulted in successful re-development of the Gorm field, horizontal drilling of a thin, 12 -ft thick Andrew reservoir and the successful appraisal of a Norwegian field. In the Niger Delta, Nigeria, shales within three reservoirs in a swamp field were “fingerprinted. ” The results showed consistent occurrence of Spiroplectammina wrightii (Syverstril 1905), Eggerelloides scabra (Williameon 1858), Heterolepa pseudoungeriana (Cush 1922) and Lenticulina inornata’d (Orbigny 1846). They provided a framework for correlating Maximum Flooding Surfaces, determining facies associations and the option of biosteering is being explored.

The similarity of trends and amplitudes of the carbon isotopic curves, together with biostratigraphic and sequence-stratigraphic markers from the Anabar Uplift,provide a precise correlation with {{the southern part of}} the Siberian Platform. Diagenesis of argillaceous limestones of the Emyaksin Formation has apparently not affected the primary isotopic variations. The resulting curve is nearly identical in sections about 100 km apart in the Tommotian-Atdabanian portion ofthe formation. Relatively frequent and pronounced isotopic oscillations in the lower beds of the Emyaksin Formation fit between features I and II of the southern Siberian isotopic reference scale but are undetected therein owing to the depositional hiatus at the base of the Tommotian Stage in its type section. This cofirms the transgressive onlap from the north suggested by previous studies,and makes the appearance of the Cambrian skeletal fossils on the Siberian Platform less abrupt. The hiatus in the south appears to embrace at least two <b>biostratigraphic</b> <b>zones</b> as recognized in the north. The case is strengthened for a pre-Tommotian Cambrian Stage in Siberia,the biostratigraphic framework for which has been elaborated earlier...|$|R
40|$|Diverse and {{abundant}} late Miocene to Pleistocene silicoflagellates at DSDP Site 504 can be correlated by tropical <b>biostratigraphic</b> <b>zones</b> and relative paleotemperature values to eastern tropical Pacific reference site DSDP 503 A {{farther to the}} west. Early Pliocene assemblages, which were poorly known until now, are present and can be correlated locally between DSDP Holes 504, 503 A, and 495, using species events associated with the new Dictyocha pulchella Subzone and Dictyocha angulata Subzone. Silicoflagellate relative paleotemperature values show major warming at 4. 7 to 5. 0 Ma (Cores 45 - 48), 3. 4 to 3. 8 Ma (Cores 32 - 33), 1. 5 to 1. 7 Ma (Cores 12 - 16), and 0. 5 to 0. 8 Ma (Cores 3 - 6). Major coolings occurred at 5. 0 to 5. 1 Ma (Core 51), 3. 9 to 4. 4 Ma (Cores 38 - 44), and 1. 0 to 1. 3 Ma (Cores 8 - 10). The appearance of Dictyocha longa is proposed to replace the asperoid/fibuloid ratio reversal as {{the bottom of the}} Dictyocha fibula Zone, because the non-evolutionary ratio reverses several times in the upper Miocene of Hole 503 A, and at least once in Hole 504. Three new Pliocene silicoflagellates are defined: Dictyocha concinna Bukry, n. sp., D. helix Bukry, n. sp., and D. tamarae Bukry, n. sp...|$|R
40|$|The dating of radiolarian <b>biostratigraphic</b> <b>zones</b> {{from the}} Silurian to Devonian is only {{partially}} understood. Dating the zircons in radiolarian-bearing tuffaceous rocks has {{enabled us to}} ascribe practical ages to the radiolarian zones. To extend knowledge in this area, radiometric dating of magmatic zircons within the radiolarian-bearing Yoshiki Formation, Japan, was undertaken. The Yoshiki Formation is mainly composed of alternating beds of tuffaceous sandstones, tuffaceous mudstones, and felsic tuff. The felsic tuff and tuffaceous mudstone yield well-preserved radiolarian fossils. Radiolarians and zircon grains were collected from 21 tuffaceous mudstone and 30 tuff horizons of the Yoshiki Formation. The following radiolarian species which can be ascribed to the Zadrappolus yoshikiensis - Futobari solidus assemblage were identified: Oriundogutta (?) kingi, Oriundogutta (?) varispina, Zadrappolus yoshikiensis, Zadrappolus tenuis, Zadrappolus hitoeganensis, Zadrappolus lunaris, Zadrappolus (?) nudus, Zadrappolus (?) sp., Futobari solidus, Futobari morishitai, Rotasphaera (?) sp., and Ceratoikiscum armiger. U-Pb SHRIMP ages of 420. 5 ± 2. 5 Ma and 421. 0 ± 1. 9 Ma {{were obtained from the}} zircon grains. Thus the lower limit of the Zadrappolus yoshikiensis-Futobari solidus assemblage, that has previously been assigned to an age from Přidolian to Pragian, is in reality before Ludlowian. The technique in this paper has the capability of refining and making more accurate the dating of many radiolarian zones worldwide, and potentially of changing the direction of the entire study of radiolarian biostratigraphy...|$|R
40|$|Annually {{resolved}} fossil {{records of}} nitrogen (N) inputs (as sedimentary d 15 N, N content), aquatic production (d 13 C, C content), and algal abundance and gross community composition (pigments, nonsiliceous microfossils) from Lough Neagh, Northern Ireland (NI), {{were compared with}} annual records of climatic variability, atmospheric and urban nutrient loading, whole-catchment nutrient budgets, and limnological monitoring data to identify the unique effects of N on the eutrophication of a phosphorus (P) -rich lake during ca. 1933 – 1995. Cluster analysis revealed two major <b>biostratigraphic</b> <b>zones.</b> Zone I (ca. 1933 – 1955) was characterized by moderate lake production, as inferred from low concentrations of most fossil pigments and reduced d 15 N signatures but elevated d 13 C values and chlorophyte microfossil concentrations. In contrast, Zone II (ca. 1955 – 1995) exhibited greatly increased contents of 15 N, N, C, and algal pigments, combined with strongly reduced d 13 C ratios and chlorophyte fossil abundance, a pattern consistent with recent severe eutrophication. Overall, microfossils of diazotrophic cyanobacteria were most abundant during the transition period between zones (ca. 1955 – 1964). Regression analysis revealed that past N influx to the lake (as d 15 N; r 2 5 0. 916, p, 0. 0001), colonial cyanobacterial abundance (as myxoxanthophyll; r 2 5 0. 837, p, 0. 0001), and total algal standing crops (as b-carotene; r 2 5 0. 388, p, 0. 0001) were all strongly correlated to agricultural inputs of N to NI farmland, weakly correlated to...|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} made of the benthic foraminifers (size {{fraction}} > 63 µm) recovered from 59 upper Eocene through Quaternary sediment samples at DSDP Site 317 (Leg 33), located {{at a depth of}} 2598 m in {{the central part of the}} Manihiki Plateau (South Pacific). The sediments cored are disturbed in only two samples. The stratigraphic assignements used are based on previous studies of planktic foraminifers and other microfossils. In total, 216 taxa are identified. A cluster analysis based on the 77 species which comprised 5 % or more of the entire foraminiferal assemblage in at least one sample suggests the presence of 3 major <b>biostratigraphic</b> <b>zones</b> corresponding approximately to the following ages, zone A: middle Miocene-Quaternary; zones B-C: early Miocene-Oligocene; and zone D: Eocene. The most important faunal turnover occurred between the Eocene and the Oligocene; a less pronounced break took place between the early and the middle Miocene, and an additional minor turnover between the Oligocene and the early Miocene. Eighteen taxa are long-ranging, being recorded from the middle Eocene through the Pliocene-Quaternary. It is concluded that, in general, benthic foraminifers of the bathyal zone are poor worldwide stratigraphic guide fossils; the following taxa are conditionally considered as the most suitable in the Eocene-Quaternary sequence: Aragonia aragonensis, Quadrimorphina profunda, Nuttallides truempyi, Abyssamina poagi, Buliminella grata, Bulimina jarvisi, B. macilenta, Turrilina alsatica, Cibicides notocenicus, C. wuellerstorfi, Pyrgo murrhina. However, most of these species are relatively rare...|$|R
40|$|Three conodont fossil occurrences stratigraphically {{above and}} below a rhyolitic tuff in the Lower Ordovician Crow Formation, {{southeast}} Yukon, constrain the tuff to the early Tremadocian Rossodus manitouensis Zone and possibly the Rossodus tenuis Zone. U–Pb dates were obtained from zircon from the tuff that was imaged with cathodoluminescence and chemically abraded to {{reduce the likelihood of}} dating grains that contain older components or suffered Pb loss, respectively. Six dates from grains with oscillatory parallel zoning are equivalent, with a weighted mean 206 Pb/ 238 U date of 491. 04 ± 0. 13 Ma. These grains are interpreted as being primary volcanic crystals, and the date is therefore taken as the depositional age of the tuff. Four other dates from grains with sector zoning are slightly older, up to 492. 0 Ma, and are interpreted as inherited or recycled from earlier volcanics. The currently defined Cambrian–Ordovician boundary is inferred to be below the tuff and separated from it by at least two conodont <b>biostratigraphic</b> <b>zones</b> that are estimated to span at least 2. 25 Ma based {{on the top of the}} Rhabdinopora flabelliformis parabola graptolite zone being older than the base of the Rossodus tenuis conodont zone. We interpret the evidence in southeast Yukon to suggest that the global Cambrian–Ordovician boundary is older (3 ̆e 493. 3 Ma) than previous estimates of 488 and 491 Ma based upon legacy 207 Pb/ 206 Pb zircon ages...|$|R
40|$|The Molteno, Elliot, and Clarens {{formations}} {{comprise the}} continental Stormberg Group of the Karoo Basin of South Africa and Lesotho. The Molteno Formation contains a well preserved macro- and microfloral assemblage but apparently no vertebrates; the Elliot and Clarens formations contain abundant vertebrates but virtually no floral remains. The vertebrate taxa represented by skeletal remains are listed and {{divided into two}} assemblages - the lower Stormberg (lower Elliot) and upper Stormberg (upper Elliot and Clarens) assemblages. The abundant, diagnosable footprint taxa are revised and their names reduced to eight genera. These ichnotaxa also fall into two <b>biostratigraphic</b> <b>zones</b> that parallel the skeletal assemblages. Comparison of the faunal assemblages {{with those of the}} European type section strongly suggests that the lower Stormberg assemblage is Late Triassic (Carnian- Norian) in age while the upper Stormberg assemblage is Early Jurassic (Hettangian-Pliens- bachian) in age. Comparisons with other continental assemblages from other areas suggest that the upper Stormberg (upper Elliot and Clarens formations) assemblage broadly correlates with the upper Newark Supergroup of eastern North America, the Glen Canyon of the southwestern United States, and the lower Lufeng Series of China- all thought to be of Early Jurassic age on the basis of floral and/or radiometric evidence. Based on these correlations, previously published paleobiogeographic maps are revised; these show a shift from Late Triassic floral and faunal provinciality to Early Jurassic homogeneity. This shift was synchronous with a widening of the equatorial arid zone. National Science Foundation, US...|$|R
