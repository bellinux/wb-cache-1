5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other <b>black</b> <b>female</b> artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E

30|$|Two other {{outcomes}} are notable as well: first, males {{are generally more}} likely than females to enroll in and complete vocational programs; and second, black males lag behind <b>black</b> <b>females</b> in enrollment and completion by even more than those of other racial groups, and they earn only marginally more than the females in the job market.

40|$|Abstract Background Central {{adiposity}} {{is related}} to chronic disease risk in adolescents. Racial differences in waist circumference have been identified using cross-sectional data from this age group. We tested for racial differences in age-related growth in waist circumference in a longitudinal cohort {{of black and white}} adolescent girls. Methods We analyzed 9 years of publicly available data from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study, for 2379 girls (1213 black and 1166 white) enrolled at age 9 - 10 years in 1987 - 1988 and followed annually. Individual growth trajectories of waist circumference were constructed for girls with > 3 annual measures. Mixed models were used to compare changes in waist circumference during adolescence between <b>black</b> and white <b>females.</b> BMI and age at menarche were included in the models. Results At each age, <b>black</b> <b>females</b> had significantly higher waist circumference. Mean annual increase in waist circumference was significantly higher for <b>black</b> <b>females</b> compared to white females (1. 46 cm/yr vs. 1. 36 cm/yr, respectively). After adjusting for BMI, the mean annual increase in waist circumference for white females was significantly higher than for <b>black</b> <b>females</b> (0. 08 cm/yr vs. - 0. 07 cm/yr, respectively). These relationships remained significant after adjusting for age at menarche. Conclusions <b>Black</b> <b>females</b> had significantly steeper increases in waist circumference over adolescence than white females. After adjusting for BMI and age at menarche, however, the annual increase in waist circumference for <b>black</b> <b>females</b> was significantly shallower than for their white peers. These data suggest racial differences in the deposition of fat over the adolescent period. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} cardiovascular disease risk in Black and Caucasian urban working females of the Makana region of the Eastern Cape. One- hundred and sixty six age-matched urban-working individuals (Black n = 88; Caucasian n = 78) voluntarily participated in this cross-sectional study. Cardiovascular disease risk was assessed in four categories: 1) obesity, classified as ‘morphological risk’, 2) blood pressure, classified as ‘cardiovascular risk’, 3) diet, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption, classified as ‘lifestyle risk’, and 4) education and income, classified as ‘socioeconomic factors’. Results showed that <b>Black</b> <b>females</b> were significantly (p< 0. 01) heavier than Caucasian females and categorized as ‘obese’ according to BMI classifications (31. 19 ± 8. 09 kg. m 2 and 25. 90 ± 4. 67 kg. m 2, respectively). <b>Black</b> <b>females</b> also presented with significantly (p< 0. 01) higher waist circumferences and waist-to-stature ratios, further confirming the obesity prevalence in this group. When accounting for those who were on anti-hypertensive mediation, <b>Black</b> <b>females</b> additionally presented with significantly (p< 0. 05) higher blood pressure, categorizing them as ‘pre-hypertensive’ (MAP = 98 ± 16 mmHg and 85 ± 11 mmHg, respectively). These results therefore placed <b>Black</b> <b>females</b> at increased cardiovascular disease risk compared to Caucasian females. With respect to lifestyle factors, <b>Black</b> <b>females</b> consumed significantly (p< 0. 05) more kilojoules carbohydrates, and total sugar than Caucasian females, and expended more physical activity MET- minutes per week (2688. 86 ± 1486. 56 MET-minutes and 1828. 27 ± 2238. 10 MET- minutes, respectively). However, reduced validity of physical activity data as well as poor dietary recall limited the interpretations of these findings. In addition, despite significant differences between smoking and alcohol consumption between groups, the majority of both <b>Black</b> and Caucasian <b>females</b> reported being non-smokers and consumed alcohol minimally. Thus, these were concluded to be unlikely contributors to cardiovascular disease risk in these samples. Socioeconomic results nevertheless expectedly showed that <b>Black</b> <b>females</b> were significantly (p< 0. 05) less educated, and subsequently earned lower incomes. It was thus concluded that this may be a likely contributor to higher cardiovascular risk in <b>Black</b> <b>females.</b> Future recommendations include the incorporation of exercise intensity measures as well as objective measures of habitual diet. This is in order to get a clearer understanding of the impact of these lifestyle factors on cardiovascular disease risk...|$|R

30|$|This study {{examined}} the presence of disparities in best graded photographs {{in comparison with the}} least well-graded photographs, and we identified statistical differences in several of the facial characteristic ratios used for facial analysis. It is worth mentioning that to date, there are no studies examining the presence of such disparities in black individuals. According to our findings, black males showed statistically significant differences in seven out of the 12 ratios used for facial analysis (interalae/interdacryon, interalae/nose width, intercheilion/interdacryon, intercheilion/interalea, forehead height/intereye-interalae, forehead height/stomion-soft menton, intereye-interalae/interalae-stomion). In <b>black</b> <b>females,</b> significant differences were present in just three out of the 12 ratios (forehead height/intereye-interalae, forehead height/stomion-soft menton, intereye-interalae/interalae-stomion). Interestingly, the disparities observed in <b>black</b> <b>females</b> were present in black males, and therefore, we can conclude that there may be agreement for these ratios and perceived attractiveness, according to the people rating the photographs, regardless of the gender of the models. In other words, these three facial characteristics may partly determine attractiveness in both black males and <b>black</b> <b>females.</b>|$|R

Beyond examining paternal involvement as a factor exclusively, this study considers other protective factors that might matter to poor <b>black</b> <b>females</b> who manage to avoid an early birth in spite of economic disadvantage. While teen birth rates have declined over the past 30 years, the disparity between racial groups remains most relevant for minorities, particularly <b>black</b> <b>females.</b> Previous research has not primarily considered the condition of <b>black</b> <b>females</b> in a study including these variables. Studies, for the most part, have focused on paternal involvement for middle class white families, separated by divorce, without regard for <b>black</b> <b>females</b> raised in single mother households. 	A convenient sample of black mothers, over age 20, living in public housing provided retrospective responses to a 92 -item questionnaire. Measures for the current study included father involvement, mother’s age at first birth, mother’s level of education, and closeness to a mother.

Maternal measures were derived from a mother’s survey used previously and the Rosenberg Self-esteem scale was used to measure self-esteem. 	Results show that 1) selected facets of father involvement do not predict early childbearing among poor black females; 2) while the mother’s education and the mother-daughter relationship do not predict early childbearing, having a mother who was once a teen mother does; and finally, 3) there was no indication that self-esteem, education and welfare status during adulthood would differ among those who gave birth before age 20 and those who did not.
