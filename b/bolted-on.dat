50|$|Weight and {{strength}} were key {{factors in the}} design of the featherbed frame for the Norton racing team's Manx. 16- Gauge Reynolds 531, a high-tensile manganese-molybdenum steel alloy, was used as it allowed the frame tubes to be made thinner for the same strength, as well as making for a more responsive frame. All the joints were Sifbronze welded, - a relatively low-temperature flame-braze - except for the sub frame which was initially <b>bolted-on</b> but welded in later versions.|$|E

50|$|Details of her {{armament}} are sketchy, but {{her sister}} ironclad, CSS Tennessee II, carried four 6.4 in Brooke rifles, two 7.0 in Brooke rifles, and a <b>bolted-on</b> spar torpedo fitted to her bow. Tennessee IIs armor was three layers of 2 in iron plate, {{and instead of}} being bolted to her deck, the pilot house formed a seamless extension of her sloped side-armor. Tennessee IIs top speed was about 5 kn, according to some sources, and her crew numbered about 133 sailors. However, {{it is unclear how}} closely Texas would have resembled her sister ironclad if she had been completed.|$|E
50|$|An ART {{train with}} three {{carriages}} is approximately 30 m long and costs approximately 15 million yuan (USD $2.2 million) to build. It can travel {{at a speed}} of 70 km/h (43.5 mph) and can carry up to 300 passengers. A five-carriage train provides space for 500 passengers. Two trains can follow each other at close proximity without being mechanically connected. The entire train has a low-floor design from a space frame with <b>bolted-on</b> panels to support the weight of passengers. It is built as a bi-directional vehicle, with driver's cabs at either end allowing it to travel in either direction at full speed.|$|E
50|$|Porsche {{launched}} the RS {{version of the}} 991 GT3 at the Geneva Motor Show in 2015. Compared to the 991 GT3, the front fenders are now equipped with louvers above the wheels and the rear fenders now include 911 Turbo-like intakes, rather than an intake below the rear wing. The roof is made from magnesium. The interior includes full bucket seats (based on the carbon seats of the 918 Spyder), carbon-fibre inserts, lightweight door handles and the Club Sport Package as standard (a <b>bolted-on</b> roll cage behind the front seats, preparation for a battery master switch, and a six-point safety harness for the driver and fire extinguisher with mounting bracket).|$|E
5000|$|The M5 {{came with}} an unusual wheel design. From 1988-1992 the M5 {{featured}} the [...] "M-System", which used directional <b>bolted-on</b> wheel covers. Under the cover was a black 5-spoke alloy wheel. The intent of the M-System cover was to divert heat from the brake assembly to increase cooling. The cover actually integrated a fin assembly behind the cover. In 1992 BMW changed the design to the [...] "M-System II" [...] (nicknamed [...] "throwing stars") which actually had even better capabilities to remove heat from the brakes. In May 1994, the M5 switched to [...] "M Parallel" [...] wheels that did away with the cover.|$|E
5000|$|The {{station was}} {{overhauled}} {{in the late}} 1970s, with repairs made to the structural and cosmetic appearance. The original BMT wall tiles were covered over with the MTA's then-standard large rectangular wall tiles, with <b>bolted-on</b> signs replacing the [...] "Cortlandt Street" [...] mosaics in the wall. Lighting was converted from incandescent to fluorescent and staircases and platform edges were repaired. Much of the cosmetic change that came with this renovation was undone in a subsequent 1998-1999 renovation. In addition to [...] "state-of-repair" [...] work and upgrades for ADA accessibility, the station's original 1918 tilework was restored. Other improvements {{were made to the}} public address system, directional signage, and concrete trackbeds.|$|E

5000|$|The Europa used a lightweight, folded & welded [...] "minimalist" [...] boxed-steel {{backbone}} chassis with a fibreglass moulded body, {{a combination}} that {{was first used}} by Lotus founder Colin Chapman in the Lotus Elan launched in 1962. Earliest versions of the Europa had the body fully-bonded to the chassis for maximum structural stiffness, however this was soon changed to a <b>bolted-on</b> body to allow normal chassis and body repairs to be made. Unlike the Elan, the Europa had no front-mounted engine or gearbox to accommodate, and so the Europa's main chassis member ran straight forward to intersect a large box-section cross-beam running across the car between the front suspension points. At the rear, the chassis split into a [...] "Y" [...] shape behind the cabin to accommodate the combined engine, transmission and final-drive components, and to support the rear suspension.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, Leo Fender began to {{experiment}} with more conventional guitar designs. As early as 1949, the familiar shape of the Telecaster can be made out in some of Fender's prototypes. Early Telecasters were plagued with issues; Leo Fender boasted {{the strength of the}} Telecasters one-piece pine neck while early adopters lamented its tendency to bow in humid weather. Fender's reluctant addition of a metal truss-rod into the necks of his guitars allowed for the much needed ability to fine-tune the instrument to the musician's specific needs. With the design of the Telecaster finalized, mass-production began in 1950. The key to Fender's ability to mass-produce an electric guitar was the modular design of the Telecaster. Its <b>bolted-on</b> neck allowed for the instrument's body and neck to be milled and finished separately and for the final assembling to be done quickly and cheaply by unskilled workers.|$|E
50|$|The turret was {{the most}} modern looking part; {{it was also an}} obvious {{makeshift}} solution, somewhat crudely welded together from plates taken from the wreck of the battleship Dunkerque scuttled in 1942, made necessary by the simple fact that Schneider as yet could not produce complete cast turrets large enough to hold a 90 mm gun. The turret front, however, was a cast section. As the turret was positioned near the middle of the tank, even when pointing to the back the gun would have a large overhang; to facilitate transport it was therefore made retractable into the turret, its breech even exiting through an rectangular opening {{in the rear of the}} bustle, covered by a <b>bolted-on</b> plate. This could also be used to load ammunition. The turret was rotated by a Simca 5 engine. Three men out of a crew of five were seated in the turret. It also held a SCR 508 radio set. This differed from the configuration in the Char B1 bis where the radio had been placed at the inner left hull side. With the ARL 44, the space gained was used for a door which was the normal way for the crew to enter the tank. Additionally there were a rectangular hatch at the left turret top, and a circular hatch at the right with between them a very low cupola for the commander.|$|E
5000|$|According {{to bridge}} {{historian}} Nathan Holth,Bowstring bridges {{are one of}} the rarest types of truss bridges, and most date in the 1870s. They fell out of favor due to the limited weight they could support. Any bowstring truss bridge that survives today is a miracle. Truss bridges are always intricate structures, but bowstring trusses are even more so. There are lattice, v-lacing, and members all over. This large amount of complexity is balanced by the simple, graceful appearance of the arched top chord. The result is a bridge with incomparable beauty and appeal.Among the rarest and oldest bridges in Canada is this breathtaking iron bowstring truss. Keystone Columns form the top chord. A sidewalk on the south side appears to be original.The bridge has undergone extensive repairs and modifications. Most notably, the top chord has had plates of steel welded {{to the top of the}} column. Numerous rods and bars have been welded onto many of the vertical and diagonal members as well. A couple of added bars of steel run lengthwise through the middle of the truss. These modifications have affected the historic integrity of the bridge, but have no doubt helped keep it standing over 130 years. The original lattice guardrails remain on the sidewalk, albeit with a metal pole welded above them.The deck surface (see illus. gallery below) is presently of renewable planking: a double file of approximately one-thousand, five hundred eight-foot two-by-fours each, on edge, upon a framework of nine longitudinally laid stringers of one-foot iron I-beams, topped with <b>bolted-on</b> wooden cladding, whose ends rest on the two abutments. Attached beneath these are fifteen transverse floor-beams, from which vertical lattice pillars, under tension, translate the live thrusts of traffic to the bowed upper chord, which transfers this back as tension along the bottom-chord [...] "string" [...] of the bow. This bottom chord consists of two sets of four 10 cm x 3 cm wrought-iron eyebars, running along, outside, both sides of the deck. Although originally two-lane, due to the weight and frequency of modern traffic, the Blackfriars is at present two-way but single-lane. Because of damage to the wooden deck surface and to the iron structure, it has been closed to automobile traffic since 2013.|$|E
40|$|Often, the way {{subject matter}} is {{included}} in educational games does not fully utilize or sometimes even inhibits the full learning potential of games. This paper argues {{that in order to}} optimally use the potential of games for learning, games should be endogenous. An endogenous educational game is a game where the educational content is integrated in the game play mechanics themselves, rather than <b>bolted-on</b> using explicit messages. This research examines the relation between explicit messages, explorative game behavior, and comprehension by developing two versions of an endogenous educational game about overfishing, one with and one without an explicit purpose. The game was tested with 13 children aged 8 to 11. The results indicate that factual knowledge and comprehension is increased with explicit messages, and in particular deep comprehension is fostered by explorative game behavior. This confirms the plea for endogenous games to teach about bombs, fish, coral reefs, and more...|$|E
40|$|Employability’ {{is now a}} {{key term}} in {{university}} strategies in the UK and increasingly across Europe. Pressure to implement such strategies can lead to <b>bolted-on</b> rather than embedded activities within academic curricula. This paper argues that employability should be an embedded ethos for translation and interpreting courses in particular. Employability can be addressed effectively by using real world applications of learning, to enrich the discipline but also to provide distinct types of intellectually stimulating content. The University of East Anglia {{has a long history}} of this approach. This paper outlines case studies of effective practice at Masters and undergraduate level, including modules where students collaborate on translations for real clients. Such an endeavour poses important challenges, both logistical and ethical: how can we expose students to real-world contexts without taking work away from professionals? This issue can be unwisely ignored or a source of academics’ reluctance to engage in such activities. Using original data from a recent alumni survey and semi-structured interviews, we map the outcomes of such an ethos. We ask whether engaging in real-world oriented activities as students affects the professional paths of alumni, both in the translation/interpreting industry and in other sectors...|$|E
40|$|In a world {{increasingly}} {{wrestling with}} global issues like conflict resolution, human rights, sustainability, intercultural harmony, and the like, values education has gained renewed prominence. In Australia, China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, Europe, including Russia, Ukraine and Iceland, South Korea, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, {{and parts of}} Africa, values education is either a mandated part of the curriculum, with teachers in training being required to prepare for teaching it, or {{is at least a}} focused part of policy development. Typically, values education has been conceived of as a <b>bolted-on</b> component of the curriculum. This article presents a novel conception of values education, in which such content is not conceptualized as a subject or unit within the curriculum but rather in terms of a new pedagogy that affects the entire curriculum and the way it is taught. In this guise, values education has a greater capacity to produce the type of citizenry that can deal effectively with the major global issues of our day. Such a conception of values education arose from the authors' research experiences with the Australian government's recent values education initiatives, which are described in the article; these experiences were instrumental to the authors in the development of their novel conception of values education...|$|E
30|$|Having {{used the}} {{internet}} to conduct content text analysis, inserting our findings into a MIT SIMILE software package to visualise the data sets and seeking comments from recent graduates to verify our initial findings, it has been possible to attain an initial idea of the actual employability discourse within {{higher education in the}} UK and USA. Our findings seem to resonate with this idea that the employability discourse within higher education is dynamic and continually shifting (Boden and Nedeva 2010). There are some differences in emphasis among the two national contexts and the HEIs themselves; this is to be expected. The findings suggest that, in the UK, the broad discourse centres around government policies, which have a significant impact upon how employability discourse is presented and targeted preparation for employment, namely through career management and <b>bolted-on</b> activities. In the USA, findings reveal that the broad discourse is centred on the institutional vision, whereby HEIs adhere to their own institutional brand in terms of who they attract, what facilities they offer and what expertise they have, and social inclusion which incorporates policies around support for disabled and disadvantaged students. Findings from both contexts suggest a steer towards a neoliberal ideology with employability for employment being at the heart of it. Recent research reflects these findings and points to HEIs becoming more entrepreneurial and customer-focused, especially those in Anglophone countries (Kalfa & Taksa 2015). We would argue that the employability agenda, as informed by global events and government ideologies, impacts upon higher education rather than higher education setting and controlling the employability agenda, and this is a key shift in determining the direction, context and content of the discourse. To follow on from this, {{it would be helpful to}} compare the discourse that has been revealed through our findings with that proposed by institutional managers and determine where the gap lies between the two. An unsuccessful attempt was made to do this, but there would be value in attaining such a perspective.|$|E
