40|$|Phytoecological {{observations}} made in agro-ecosystems in the Chaouia region {{revealed that}} the tufts of wild jujube andquot;Ziziphus lotus (L.) Desf. andquot; enclaved in the hedges of <b>Barbary</b> <b>fig</b> andquot;Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill. andquot; slow their biological activity and their growth and ends by being eliminated completely. The hypothesis that put into play the phenomenon of allelopathy as a mechanism of interference between the two species has been verified in this study. Thus, bioassays were conducted in vitro in the laboratory {{in order to test}} the effects of aqueous and hydro-ethanolic extracts of aerial and belowground parts of <b>Barbary</b> <b>fig</b> on seed germination and seedling growth of wild jujube. A dosage of total phenols by Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and a subsequent identification of these phenols compounds have been made. The results showed that these phenols are present in both stems and roots of <b>Barbary</b> <b>fig,</b> with varying concentrations (6. 91 to 42. 75 mg EAG/g of dry weight) according organ of the plant and the solvent used in the extraction. Very significant inhibitory effects up to 100 % were observed on the kinetics and the final rate of jujube seed germination as well as its growth. These results allowed us to infer the existence of a strong correlation between allelopathic effects of <b>Barbary</b> <b>fig</b> on jujube and the concentration of total phenols content in different parts of this species of cactus...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBarbary fig (Opuntia ficus indica) {{could be}} an {{economically}} important species as it {{could be an}} alternative crop extremely tolerant to dry condition and water deficiency. Moreover, it could be used in alternative sustainable cultivation systems and landscape conservation. In this work, we report the analysis of the genetic diversity of Greek <b>Barbary</b> <b>fig</b> genotypes using ISSR molecular markers. Six primers were screened to assess their ability to detect polymorphisms within twenty-two <b>Barbary</b> <b>fig</b> accessions and generated 57 markers (bands), with an average of 9. 5 markers per primer. The percentage of polymorphic bands (50. 21 %) and the resolving power (RP) (28. 85) showed the efficiency of the used primers. Mean values for GD (gene diversity) and I (Shannon index) were found as 0. 215 and 0. 355, respectively. The revealed ISSR markers allow distinguishing all accessions analyzed except for one case. UPGMA dendrogram and PCoA (Principal Coordinate Analysis) were performed to access patterns of diversity among genotypes. The high genetic diversity existing in the Greek germplasm suggests that it would be beneficial to utilize this pool in <b>Barbary</b> <b>fig</b> breeding programs and germplasm management activities...|$|R
40|$|In {{the coffee}} based {{land use system}} of Nduuri in Embu District, Kenya, farmers have devised several methods of {{replenishing}} soil fertility namely use of sweet potatoes in rotation, use of farm yard manure (FYM), use of crop residues and planting <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> (Ficus sycomorus) in coffee farms. Farmers claim the <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> modifies the microclimate and improves soil fertility. Six farmers recorded the weights of coffee berries harvested from coffee <b>trees</b> under the <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> and outside the <b>fig</b> <b>tree.</b> 100 -berry weight {{as well as the}} weight of a used cooking oil tin full of berries was also recorded. Soil samples were taken from under the <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> and outside the <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> canopy for analysis. Results indicated no significant difference (P= 0. 05) in yield or soil quality under the <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> or outside. However because of apparent numerical difference and given the many other uses of the <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> farmers could be advised to plant/retain the <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> in the coffee farms. In the process farmers will also be contributing to the conservation of biodiversity...|$|R

40|$|While sacred groves (forest {{fragments}} protected {{for religious}} reasons) are widely acknowledged {{to have a}} beneficial effect on biodiversity conservation, the ecological benefits of individual sacred <b>trees</b> remain unknown. <b>Fig</b> <b>trees</b> are present as sacred trees in humandominated landscapes across South Asia and are considered keystone species for wildlife in tropical forests. If frugivores continue to visit <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> in disturbed landscapes, they may deposit seeds of other <b>tree</b> species beneath <b>fig</b> canopies, ultimately facilitating forest regeneration. We studied whether sacred <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> in Tamil Nadu, India can facilitate seed dispersal in human-dominated landscapes. We quantified abundance of sacred <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> at the study site, assessed whether seed-dispersing frugivore visitation to <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> is affected by human disturbance, and compared tree seedling density beneath <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> and open areas. We found that some species of frugivorous birds and bats will visit large <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> in conditions of high human disturbance and that tree seedling density is significantly higher under sacred trees compared to open areas. By promoting frugivore activity, sacred <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> may have a beneficial effect on biodiversity conservation in human-dominated landscapes...|$|R
