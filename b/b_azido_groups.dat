Azido-terminated silica nanoparticles were prepared by the functionalization of bare silica nanoparticles with 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane followed by the reaction with 4 -azidobenzoic acid. The azido functionalization was confirmed by FTIR and XPS. Poly(allylamine hydrochloride) was also grafted with phenyl <b>azido</b> <b>groups</b> and used as photoreactive polycations for LbL assembly. For the photoreactive silica nanoparticle/polycation multilayers, UV irradiation can induce the covalent cross-linking within the multilayers {{as well as the}} anchoring of the multilayer film onto the organic substrate, through azido photochemical reactions including C–H insertion/abstraction reactions with surrounding molecules and dimerization of <b>azido</b> <b>groups.</b> Our results show that the stability of the silica nanoparticle/polycation multilayer film was greatly improved after UV irradiation. Combined with a fluoroalkylsilane post-treatment, the photoreactive LbL multilayers were used as a coating for superhydrophobic modification of cotton fabrics. Herein the LbL assembly method enables us to tailor the number of the coated silica nanoparticles through the assembly cycles. The superhydrophobicity of cotton fabrics was durable against acids, bases, and organic solvents, as well as repeated machine wash.

40|$|INGENIERIE+TLE:JEC:DFAWe have {{developed}} a generic two-step post-functionalisation technique for transforming amino-functionalised MOFs into their isocyanate analogues. The {{first part of the}} synthetic pathway consists in the conversion of the amino moieties into <b>azido</b> <b>groups.</b> Next, the thermal activation of these <b>azido</b> <b>groups</b> leads to nitrene species that can react with carbon monoxide to yield the desired products. As a proof of concept, this method was applied to the highly stable Al-MIL- 53 -NH 2 and to the acid-sensitive In-MIL- 68 -NH 2. The resulting nitrene species were highly reactive, with side reactions dominating initially.

Substitution of the –CH 3 {{group on the}} secondary amine group of the N,N-dimethyldiamine fragment of the Schiff base by a H-atom leads to a structural change from a methoxido-bridged dimer (1) to a single hydroxido-bridged dimer (2). Both complexes have been characterized by single-crystal X-ray analyses, IR and UV–Vis spectroscopy and DFT studies. Both dimers are centrosymmetric containing two FeIII atoms which are bridged by two methoxido ions in compound 1 and by two hydroxido ions in compound 2. The chelating tridentate Schiff base and a terminal <b>azido</b> <b>group</b> complete the distorted octahedral environment around each iron center in both complexes. To explain the preferential bridging ability of methoxido and hydroxido groups in complexes 1 and 2, we have carried out theoretical calculations based on DFT to compare their formation energies and dimerization energies. In the case of complex 2, it is noticed that the close proximity of the <b>azido</b> <b>group</b> from the iron centers allow the hydroxido bridged complex to gain extra stability through H-bonds, whereas due to the steric crowding of the <b>azido</b> <b>group</b> and the methyl moiety of adjacent molecules, complex 1 disfavors the formation of hydrogen bonds as well as hydroxido bridging...|$|R
