The release was discontinued after several doves perched themselves at the cauldron's rim and were burned alive in the Olympic Flame during the opening ceremony of the 1988 Summer Olympics. It was later replaced with a symbolic release of doves after the flame has been lit.|$|E

5|$|King's Highway 80, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway 80, was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario.

5|$|As {{a result}} of such dynamics, Pleione {{exhibits}} prominent long-term photometric and spectroscopic variations encompassing a period of about 35 years. In fact, during the last 100 years, Pleione has demonstrated notable phase changesas a Be phase until 1903, a B phase (1905–1936), a B-shell phase (1938–1954), and another Be phase (1955–1972). It then entered a Be-shell phase in 1972. Then, the star developed many shell absorption lines in its spectrum. At the same time, the star showed a decrease in brightness, <b>beginning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of 1971. After reaching the minimum brightness in late 1973, the star gradually brightened. In 1989, Pleione entered a Be phase and stayed as a Be star until the summer of 2005.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries, the area's legal and {{political}} status was disputed. The Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War in 1783, had defined the northern border between the United States and Canada based on the inaccurate Mitchell Map. Ownership of the area between Lake of the Woods and Lake Superior was unclear, with the United States claiming the border was further north at the Kaministiquia River and Canada claiming it was further south <b>beginning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Saint Louis River. In 1842, the Webster–Ashburton Treaty clarified {{the border between the}} United States and Canada using the old trading route running along the Pigeon River and Rainy River (today the BWCAW's northern border).|$|E

The home jersey was similar to the previous season version with an updated sponsor name. The away kit took design cues from the white and green colours of the flag of Rotterdam and incorporates the coat of arms of Rotterdam {{on the side of the}} jersey.|$|E
5|$|Janikowski's post-score kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Vick and the Tech offense {{began at}} their 20-yard line. On the Hokies' first play, Davis ran for 16yards and {{a first down}} on an end-around {{similar to the one}} he ran in the first quarter. Despite that success, the Hokies were unable to gain another first down. Appearing to punt the ball away, Tech ran a trick play where the punter {{attempted}} to rush for a first down. He was stopped short of the needed mark, however, and Florida State's offense returned to the field, <b>beginning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tech 43-yard line. On the first play after taking over, Weinke completed a 43-yard pass to Warrick for a touchdown. The score and extra point gave Florida State a 4629 lead with 7:42 remaining in the game.|$|E

For a while, he wanted to become a professional golfer. While in high school, Mitsuda rediscovered music, inspired by Vangelis' Blade Runner and Henry Mancini's The Pink Panther film scores. After watching Railman, he decided to become a music composer. He became interested in PCs after his father bought him one, which was a rare item at the time. He started to program computer games and compose music for them, as well as take more technically oriented classes.|$|E
5|$|Most {{shooting}} {{was done at}} the Arthur Ranch in the San Francisco Valley, which was used as Aunt Elizabeth's estate for interior and exterior scenes. <b>Beginning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Arthur Ranch shoot, Grant and Hepburn often ad-libbed their dialogue and frequently delayed production by making each other laugh. The scene where Grant frantically asks Hepburn where his bone is was shot from 10 am until well after 4 pm because of the stars' laughing fits. After one month of shooting Hawks was seven days behind schedule. During the filming, Hawks would refer to four {{different versions of the}} film's script and make frequent changes to scenes and dialogue. His leisurely attitude on set and shutting down production to see a horse race contributed to the time it took to film, and he took twelve days to shoot the Westlake jail scene instead of the scheduled five. Hawks later facetiously blamed the setbacks on his two stars' laughing fits and having to work with two animal actors.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the largest}} groups of {{surviving}} works of art are the seal matrices that appear to have entered Scottish usage with feudalism in the reign of David I, <b>beginning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> royal court and among his Anglo-Norman vassals and then by about 1250 they began to spread to the Gaelicised areas of the country. They would be made compulsory for barons of the king in a statute of 1401 and seal matrices show very high standards of skill and artistry. Examples of items that were probably the work of continental artists include the delicate hanging lamp in St. John's Kirk in Perth, the vestments and hangings in Holyrood and the Medieval maces of the Universities of St Andrews and Glasgow.|$|E

5|$|Schneider {{plays in}} the {{butterfly}} style of goaltending, dropping to his knees with his skates pointing outwards and his pads meeting in the middle in order to cover the bottom portion of the net. He honed the style with goaltending consultant Brian Daccord, <b>beginning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 15. After joining the Canucks as a backup in 2010–11, Schneider began working with the team goaltending coach Roland Melanson, who encouraged him to play shallower in his crease. Schneider adopted the style which required him to be more athletic on first shots, but better prepared him for rebounds and cross-crease plays. Schneider's strengths are his size and athleticism. His coach with the Moose, Scott Arniel, has also heralded his ability to get into position ahead of time, anticipating plays.|$|E
5|$|Superb and Temeraire {{returned}} home {{the following month}} after supporting Allied operations in the Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea and were placed into reserve. Later that year, Temeraire was converted into a cadet training ship and continued on that duty until early 1921 when she was paid off. In the meantime Superb relieved Bellerophon as a gunnery training ship in late 1919 and the latter was reduced to reserve. Superb was relieved in her turn {{at the end of}} 1919 and was paid off in early 1920. The ship was used for gunnery trials <b>beginning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the year and was used as a target ship during 1922 before being sold, the last of the sisters still in existence as Temeraire and Bellerophon had been sold for scrap in late 1921.|$|E
5|$|The African {{elephant}} has two finger-like extensions {{at the tip}} of {{the trunk}} that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles <b>beginning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tip.|$|E

5|$|The {{settlements}} were small, forming family based communities, {{but some}} of them were more sizable and functioned over many generations. They lacked artificial fortifications, but natural factors facilitating self-defense were often utilized. Such settlements could form small clusters separated by uninhabited areas. One rather large dwelling place, which functioned from the 2nd to the 4th century, was discovered and investigated in Osowo near Suwałki. The living quarters consisted of pillar supported houses, while the farming infrastructure area included eighty grain storage caves. Small fortified refuge areas were built to a limited extend <b>beginning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the 4th century, but on a larger scale fortified settlements were constructed by the Western Balts only during the Middle Ages.|$|E

Wilson Avenue intersects M-45 (Lake Michigan Drive) in the Standale Business District. South of Lake Michigan Drive, the trunkline continues on Wilson Avenue through the edge of a rural area.
