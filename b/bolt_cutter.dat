25|$|Upon his release, O'Hare {{found that}} the INLA had split into hostile armed factions, one calling itself the Irish People's Liberation Organisation, the other known as 'INLA GHQ'. The IPLO assassinated INLA leaders Ta Power and John O'Reilly and in revenge, O'Hare is accused of the killing of Tony McCloskey, an IPLO {{associate}} who had allegedly tipped them off as to O'Reilly and Power's whereabouts. McCloskey was abducted {{from his home in}} County Monaghan on 6 February 1987. His ear and finger were cut off with a <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter</b> before he was eventually shot and his body dumped in a rural part of the same county. O'Hare is alleged to have been behind the abduction and killing. Seven INLA members died in the feud.|$|E

A chain link fence bordering the property had been cut with a <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter,</b> and a <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter</b> later found in Homick's home was matched microscopically to cut-marks on the fence.

Walker then hid the <b>bolt</b> <b>cutters</b> in an adjoining area, got into his car, and drove around the block to see if he had been observed.

50|$|A <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter,</b> {{sometimes}} called bolt cropper, {{is a tool}} used for cutting chains, padlocks, bolts and wire mesh. The original use for bolt cutters was, as the name suggests, to cut bolt seals from shipping containers at the delivery point. It typically has long handles and short blades, with compound hinges to maximize leverage and cutting force. A typical <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter</b> yields 20 kN of cutting force for a 250 N force on the handles.|$|E

50|$|Linkages are {{important}} components of machines and tools. Examples {{range from the}} four-bar linkage used to amplify force in a <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter</b> or to provide independent suspension in an automobile, to complex linkage systems in robotic arms and walking machines. The internal combustion engine uses a slider-crank four-bar linkage formed from its piston, connecting rod, and crankshaft to transform power from expanding burning gases into rotary power. Relatively simple linkages are often used to perform complicated tasks.|$|E

Wade Barrett demanded {{the key to the}} cage door off another referee but the referee threw the key into the crowd. Meanwhile, Cena pushed Sheamus, causing Sheamus to knock the referee down, and applied the STF on Sheamus. Sheamus submitted but the referee was still down,. Cena attempted to climb out of the cage but Justin Gabriel climbed the cage, distracting Cena. Whilst The Nexus prevented Cena from climbing off the cage, Sheamus climbed out of the cage to retain the title.|$|R

50|$|Kensington locks are not {{designed}} to be an impervious protection measure. Because most computer equipment cases are generally made of plastic or thin metal, the lock can be torn out, though not without doing significant visible damage to the case. The cable itself can be cut if an individual has a wire cutter or <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter</b> sufficiently strong {{to cut through the}} cable material, which will vary between different brands of cable. The Kensington type locks are useful to discourage quick grab-and-run thefts of equipment from casually supervised locations such as coffee shops, but cannot prevent the removal of equipment secured in an unattended location.|$|E

Both MESA- 2 D and DYNA 3 D have been used to evaluate the role of several design parameters on the performance of a satellite separation system <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter.</b> Due to a lack of high strain rate response data for the materials involved, the properties for the <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter</b> and the bolt were selected to achieve agreement between computer simulation and observed characteristics of the recovered test hardware. The calculations provided insight into design parameters such as the cutter blade kinetic energy, the preload on the bolt, the relative position of the anvil, and the anvil shape. Modeling of the cutting process clarifies metallographic observation of both cut and uncut bolts obtained from several tests. Understanding the physical processes involved in <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter</b> operation may suggest certain design modifications that could improve performance margin without increasing environmental shock response levels...|$|E

40|$|Strangulation of {{the penis}} by {{application}} of constricting devices may present {{a challenge for}} the treating physician. Depending {{on the type of}} constricting material, special equipment is essential for successful removal of the foreign bodies. We report a new form of constricting device, the neck of a Coca Cola bottle made of Pentaethylene-terephthalate (PET). Particular difficulties were encountered upon removal. Technical details of this case are described. Prior literature on the treatment of penile strangulation is discussed. KEY WORDS: penis; strangulation; constriction; autoeroticism. CASE REPORT A 69 -year old man presented to the emergency room at 4 a. m. The man was drunk, wrapped in a blanket, and obviously suffering from pain in the genital area. Removal of the blanket disclosed a grossly swollen dark, red penis completely stuck inside a 1. 5 l Coca Cola PET bottle. The man had inserted his penis into the bottle for autoerotic purposes. The bottle neck was located directly at the penile base and penile swelling prevented even a turning of the bottle. Reluctantly, the patient reported insertion of his penis into the bottle more than 10 hr ago. His repeated at-tempts of removal of the bottle had remained unsuccessful. By use of a <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter</b> available in the emergency room, the bottle was incised below its neck. Attempts to position the cutter at the bottle neck were unsuccessful. As shown in Fig. 1, bottle necks of PET bottles are equipped with a wide collar and manufactured from particularly firm material. Since the branches of wire cutters open for a maximum width of only 1. 5 cm, cutting of a PET bottle neck is impossible. The idea of using a manually operate...|$|E
