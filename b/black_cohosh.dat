25|$|Liver {{damage has}} been {{reported}} in a few individuals using <b>black</b> <b>cohosh,</b> but many women have taken the herb without reporting adverse health effects, and a meta-analysis of several well-controlled clinical trials found no evidence that <b>black</b> <b>cohosh</b> preparations have any adverse effect on liver function.|$|E
25|$|Native Americans used <b>black</b> <b>cohosh</b> {{to treat}} {{gynecological}} and other disorders, including sore throat, kidney problems, and depression. Following {{the arrival of}} European settlers in the U.S. who continued the medicinal usage of <b>black</b> <b>cohosh,</b> the plant appeared in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia in 1830 under the name “black snakeroot”. In 1844 A. racemosa gained popularity when John King, an eclectic physician, used it to treat rheumatism and nervous disorders. Other eclectic physicians of the mid-nineteenth century used <b>black</b> <b>cohosh</b> {{for a variety of}} maladies, including endometritis, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, sterility, severe after-birth pains, and for increased breast milk production.|$|E

25|$|The {{plant species}} {{has a history}} of taxonomic {{uncertainty}} dating back to Carl Linnaeus, who— on the basis of morphological characteristics of the inflorescence and seeds— had placed the species into the genus Actaea. This designation was later revised by Thomas Nuttall reclassifying the species to the genus Cimicifuga. Nuttall's classification was based solely on the dry follicles produced by <b>black</b> <b>cohosh,</b> which are typical of species in Cimicifuga. However, recent data from morphological and gene phylogeny analyses demonstrate that <b>black</b> <b>cohosh</b> is more closely related to species of the genus Actaea than to other Cimicifuga species. This has prompted the revision to Actaea racemosa as originally proposed by Linnaeus. Blue cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides), despite its similar common name belongs to another family, the Berberidaceae, and is therefore not closely related to <b>black</b> <b>cohosh.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although {{evidence}} for a link between <b>black</b> <b>cohosh</b> and liver damage is not conclusive, Australia has added a warning to the label of all black cohosh-containing products, stating that it may cause harm to the liver in some individuals {{and should not be}} used without medical supervision. Other studies conclude that liver damage from use of <b>black</b> <b>cohosh</b> is unlikely, and that the main concern over its safe use is lack of proper authentication of plant materials and adulteration of commercial preparations with other plant species.|$|E
25|$|Actaea racemosa (<b>black</b> <b>cohosh,</b> black bugbane, black snakeroot, fairy candle; syn. Cimicifuga racemosa) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant of the family Ranunculaceae. It is native to eastern North America from the extreme south of Ontario to central Georgia, and west to Missouri and Arkansas. It grows {{in a variety of}} woodland habitats, and is often found in small woodland openings. The roots and rhizomes have long been used medicinally by Native Americans. Extracts from these plant materials are thought to possess analgesic, sedative, and anti-inflammatory properties. <b>Black</b> <b>cohosh</b> extracts are being studied as treatments for symptoms associated with menopause.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the vast}} {{majority}} of <b>black</b> <b>cohosh</b> materials are harvested from plants growing in the wild, a recurring concern regarding the safety of black cohosh-containing dietary supplements is mis-identification of plants causing unintentional mixing-in (adulteration) of potentially harmful materials from other plant sources.|$|E
25|$|Plants {{traditionally}} used as bed bug repellents include <b>black</b> <b>cohosh</b> (Actaea racemosa), Pseudarthria hookeri, and Laggera alata (Chinese yángmáo cǎo | 羊毛草), though {{information about}} their effectiveness is lacking. Eucalyptus saligna oil was reported by some Zairean researchers to kill bed bugs, among other insects.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{a number}} of herbs reputed to possess {{abortifacient}} properties {{have been used in}} folk medicine: tansy, pennyroyal, <b>black</b> <b>cohosh,</b> and the now-extinct silphium. The use of herbs in such a manner can cause serious—even lethal—side effects, such as multiple organ failure, and is not recommended by physicians.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} of consistent benefit of alternative therapies for menopausal symptoms despite their popularity. The effect of soy isoflavones on menopausal symptoms is promising for reduction of hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Evidence does not support a benefit from phytoestrogens such as coumestrol, femarelle, or the non-phytoestrogen <b>black</b> <b>cohosh.</b> There is {{no evidence}} to support the efficacy of acupuncture as a management for menopausal symptoms. As of 2011 there is no support for herbal or dietary supplements in the prevention or treatment of the mental changes that occur around menopause. A 2016 Cochrane review found not enough evidence to show a difference between Chinese herbal medicine and placebo for the vasomotor symptoms.|$|E
