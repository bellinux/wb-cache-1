50|$|Dalbergia nigra, {{commonly}} known as the <b>Bahia</b> <b>rosewood,</b> jacarandá da Bahia, Brazilian rosewood, Rio rosewood, jacarandá de Brasil, pianowood, caviuna, or obuina, is a species of legume in the Fabaceae family.|$|E
5000|$|All genuine {{rosewood}}s {{belong to}} the genus Dalbergia. The preeminent rosewood appreciated in the Western world is the wood of Dalbergia nigra which is [...] a CITES-listed endangered species on Appendix 1, which means no commercial sales for wood that is cut after 1992. It {{is best known as}} Brazilian Rosewood, but also as <b>Bahia</b> <b>rosewood.</b> This wood has a strong sweet smell, which persists for many years, explaining the name rosewood.|$|E
50|$|The {{pre-eminent}} rosewood appreciated in {{the western}} world is D. nigra known as Rio, <b>Bahia,</b> Brazilian <b>Rosewood,</b> Palisander de Rio Grande, or Jacarandá; heavily exploited in the past, it is now listed on CITES Appendix I. The second most desired rosewood {{in the western}} world is D. latifolia known as (East) Indian Rosewood or Sonokeling. Most rosewoods are a rich brown with a good figure. Note that {{only a small number of}} Dalbergia species yield rosewood. Several East Asian species are important materials in traditional Chinese furniture.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Nitric oxide (NO) is a {{compound}} that participates in vegetable physiologic processes. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the efficiency of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor, on the physiologic and biochemical responses of Dalbergia nigra (<b>bahia</b> <b>rosewood)</b> seeds under storage in different environmental conditions. Seeds recently collected were stored in cold chamber (5 ºC and 60 % relative humidity, RH) or in two desiccators at 20 ºC: 55 and 93 % RH for four months. Every month of storage seed samples were taken and imbibed in SNP solution at 10 - 4 M concentration for 48 hours or in water. The germination percentage, electric conductivity, lipid peroxidation and catalase enzyme activity were evaluated. Seeds of <b>bahia</b> <b>rosewood</b> stored in cold chamber at 55 % RH maintained physiologic quality, while seeds imbibed in SNP reduced the membrane permeability, decreasing lipid peroxidation and increasing catalase activity. Seeds kept under 93 % RH deteriorated quickly, and SNP was not efficient in revert the seed degradation. It was concluded that nitric oxide maintain the quality of seeds stored in cold chamber and at 20 ºC and 55 % RH, by maintaining membrane integrity and stimulating catalase activity...|$|E
40|$|Seed imbibitions is {{the first}} stage of the {{germination}} process and is characterized by the hydration of tissues and cells and the activation and/or induction of the enzymes responsible for mobilizing reserves for respiration and the construction of new cell structures. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the alterations in reserve substances during slow hydration of <b>Bahia</b> <b>Rosewood</b> (Dalbergia nigra) seeds in water. Seeds from two different lots (Lot I and II) were placed in saturated desiccators (95 - 99 % RH) to hydrate at 15 and 25 °C until water contents of 10, 15, 20 and 25 % were reached. At each level of hydration, changes in lipid reserves, soluble carbohydrates, starch and soluble proteins were evaluated. The mobilization of reserves was similarly assessed in both lots, with no differences being observed between the two hydration temperatures. Lipid contents showed little variation during hydration, while the contents of soluble carbohydrates and starch decreased after the 15 % water content level. Soluble proteins showed a gradual tendency to decrease between the control (dry seeds) up to 25 % water content...|$|E
40|$|Germination is {{a process}} that begins with seed water uptake, {{stimulating}} enzyme synthesis or activating enzymes already present. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate variations in monosaccharide reserves and the activities of the &# 945;-galactosidase and polygalacturonase enzymes during the hydration of two lots of Dalbergia nigra (<b>Bahia</b> <b>Rosewood)</b> seeds. Seeds from different origins constituted the two lots I and II, classified as high and low vigor, respectively. Both lots were placed in desiccators with a high relative humidity to hydrate and at 15 and 25 °C until levels of 10, 15, 20 and 25 % moisture levels in seeds were reached. The seed cotyledons were analyzed for the quantity of monosaccharides and enzyme activity. The control had higher concentrations of xylose and rhamnose, which decreased during hydration until the 15 % level was reached, after which concentrations increased again in both lots. Lot I, with a superior quality, showed higher glucose synthesis and degradation during seed hydration. Both enzymes were pre-existing since activity was already present in the seeds without imbibition. The polygalacturonase enzyme increased and the &# 945;-galactosidase enzyme remained relatively constant during seed hydration...|$|E
