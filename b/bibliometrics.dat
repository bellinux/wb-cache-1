HEEACT further provides subject rankings in science and technology fields. It also ranked the top 300 universities across ten science and technology fields.|$|E
25|$|The {{mathematics}} of PageRank {{are entirely}} general and apply to any graph or network in any domain. Thus, PageRank is now regularly used in <b>bibliometrics,</b> social and information network analysis, and for link prediction and recommendation. It's even used for systems analysis of road networks, {{as well as}} biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and physics.|$|E
25|$|In {{the area}} of {{communications}} research and informetrics, the concept of self-organizing systems appears in mid-1990s research related to scientific communications. Scientometrics and <b>bibliometrics</b> are areas of research in which discrete data are available, as are several other areas of social communications research such as sociolinguistics. Social complexity is also a concept used in semiotics.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bibliometrics</b> is {{also one}} of the science and {{technology}} indicators. It is finding information patterns by analyzing citation patterns analyzing word use frequencies using statistical analysis. <b>Bibliometrics</b> is the application of quantitative analysis and statistics to publications such as journal articles and their accompanying citation counts. Quantitative evaluation of publication and citation data is now used in almost all nations around the globe with a sizeable science enterprise. <b>Bibliometrics</b> is used in research performance evaluation, especially in university and government labs, and also by policymakers, research directors and administrators, information specialists and librarians, and researchers’ themselves. The purpose of <b>Bibliometrics</b> is to make quantitative analysis of science and technology performance, quantitative analysis of the cognitive and organizational structure of science and technology and to know how a certain science or technology has evolved in a certain period of time. In Ethiopia, <b>Bibliometrics</b> analysis has not been conducted. But, in 2014, Science and Technology Information center (STIC) is planning to conduct it.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bibliometrics</b> is {{statistical}} analysis of written publications, such as books or articles. [...] Bibliometric methods are frequently used {{in the field of}} library and information science, including scientometrics. For instance, <b>bibliometrics</b> are used to provide quantitative analysis of academic literature or for evaluating budgetary spending. Citation analysis is a commonly used bibliometric method which is based on constructing the citation graph, a network or graph representation of the citations between documents. Many research fields use bibliometric methods to explore the impact of their field, the impact of a set of researchers, or the impact of a particular paper. <b>Bibliometrics</b> also has a wide range of other applications, such as in descriptive linguistics, the development of thesauri, and evaluation of reader usage.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bibliometrics</b> is the {{application}} of quantitative analysis and statistics to publications such as journal articles and their accompanying citation counts. Quantitative evaluation of publication and citation data is now used in almost all science fields to evaluate growth, maturity, leading authors, conceptual and intellectual maps, trend of a scientific community. <b>Bibliometrics</b> is also used in research performance evaluation, especially in university and government labs, and also by policymakers, research directors and administrators, information specialists and librarians, and scholars themselves.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bibliometrics</b> are {{now used}} in {{quantitative}} research assessment exercises of academic output which {{is starting to}} threaten practice based research. The UK government has considered using <b>bibliometrics</b> as a possible auxiliary tool in its Research Excellence Framework, a process which will assess {{the quality of the}} research output of UK universities and {{on the basis of the}} assessment results, allocate research funding. This has met with significant scepticism and, after a pilot study, looks unlikely to replace the current peer review process.|$|E
