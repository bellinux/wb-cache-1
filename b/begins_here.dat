5|$|The West Sacramento Freeway {{begins on}} Interstate 80 at exit 81 (West Capitol Avenue), {{the east end}} of the Yolo Causeway. It soon splits, with I-80 exiting to bypass Sacramento to the north and Interstate 80 Business (legislatively U.S. Route 50) {{continuing}} east via exit 82 towards downtown. After one interchange, at Harbor Boulevard (exit 1/1B), the freeway splits again, with Bus. 80 turning abruptly southeast over the Pioneer Memorial Bridge to avoid downtown Sacramento. State Route 275 <b>begins</b> <b>here,</b> at exit 3 of Bus. 80, with full access to and from the intersecting Jefferson Boulevard (State Route 84).|$|E
5|$|Upon {{entering}} the border town of Dryden, NY38 {{emerges from the}} valley and becomes Dryden–Harford Road as it heads northwestward through a more low-lying but still undeveloped area. The highway gradually curves to the north toward the village of Dryden, where the route changes names to South Street upon {{entering the}} village limits. It continues north across Virgil Creek and past three blocks of homes to the commercial village center, where it intersects both NY13 and NY392. The latter <b>begins</b> <b>here</b> and heads off to the east while the former joins NY38 along North Street.|$|E

5|$|A short {{distance}} past the city line, NY5 passes over the Union Ship Canal on {{a span of}} the elevated road known as the Father Baker Bridge. North of the waterway, the Skyway gains a frontage road named Fuhrmann Boulevard. Both the service road and the Skyway run parallel to Lake Erie until {{the northern end of}} the Buffalo Outer Harbor. Here, the frontage roads end while NY5 turns to the northeast, crossing the Buffalo River and entering downtown. On the north bank, the Skyway returns to a northerly routing as it passes KeyBank Center, located directly to the east, and Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, situated to the west, and meets I-190 at exit7. Past the interchange, the Skyway ends and the route descends in elevation, becoming an at-grade roadway once more at Church Street in the shadow of Buffalo City Hall. NY384 <b>begins</b> <b>here,</b> following Delaware Avenue north into the heart of downtown, while NY5 turns east onto Church.|$|E
5|$|One block {{north of}} NY79, NY96 splits from NY13 and NY34 and {{heads to the}} west at Buffalo Street. NY89 <b>begins</b> <b>here,</b> and NY96 {{overlaps}} with NY89 toward the West End of Ithaca. After crossing southbound NY13 and NY34, NY89 and NY96 run parallel to and a few feet {{to the north of}} NY79. NY89 turns north onto Taughannock Boulevard at the next intersection while NY96 continues west across the lake outlet as Cliff Street, paralleling NY79. They do not intersect in this area—known locally as The Octopus—though they once did. At one time, NY96, NY79, NY89, NY13A and Elm Street met at an intersection that gave the area its name. Today, only NY13A and NY79 intersect there while the stub of former NY89 is now a park access road that intersects with NY96, which continues north out of the Cayuga Lake valley as Trumansburg Road.|$|E
25|$|On {{the east}} side of the Hudson, NY52 and I-84 cross over Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line just north of the Beacon station, visible from the bridge. They pass briefly through the {{northern}} corner of the city of Beacon, where the bridge's $1.50 toll is collected from eastbound traffic. Immediately afterwards is the town of Fishkill and Exit 11. NY9D crosses, taking traffic north towards Wappingers Falls and south into Beacon. NY52 Business <b>begins</b> <b>here</b> along the latter direction.|$|E

25|$|After OR 210, {{the next}} major route {{encountered}} is OR 10, just west of Farmington. About five miles (8km) after that, OR 219 enters the city of Hillsboro as it crosses the Tualatin River and passes by Jackson Bottom Wetlands Preserve. Entering downtown Hillsboro, OR 219 becomes South 1st Street before ending at the intersection with Oregon Route 8, the Tualatin Valley Highway.

25|$|The {{depiction}} of the fighting <b>begins</b> <b>here</b> with the great mother goddess of Asia Minor, Rhea/Cybele. With bow and arrow she rides into battle on a lion. On the left can be seen the eagle of Zeus holding a bundle of lightning bolts in his claws. Next to Rhea, three of the immortals fight with a mighty, bull-necked Giant. The first, a goddess, has not been identified; she is followed by Hephaistos, who raises a two-headed hammer aloft. He is followed by another unidentified, kneeling god who thrusts a spear into the body.|$|E
25|$|After Croton Falls station, the Harlem Line {{runs along}} East Branch Reservoir and crosses into Putnam County and its rural landscape. Above Southeast station (formerly Brewster North), the {{railroad}} passes under Interstate 84 {{and through the}} yards at Putnam Junction. This is the northern boundary of third rail electrification. Diesel territory and single track operation <b>begins</b> <b>here.</b> The Wassaic Branch is not signalized, and manual block system rules are used to direct train movements. The track finally follows its own course, away from any road or river, past the abandoned Towners station up to Patterson and into Dutchess County.|$|E

25|$|Route 159 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} of US 46 westbound. Route 159 heads eastward, following a divided Bloomfield Avenue along a commercial strip near the Passaic River. The highway continues, crossing the river, and passing West Essex Park. Nearby {{to the south}} are the park's woodlands and to the north, across the divided highway, is a large commercial development. Right after West Essex Park ends, Route 159 comes to a Y intersection, where it leaves Bloomfield Avenue and turns to the north along Oak Road; County Route 506 <b>begins</b> <b>here</b> and runs east along Bloomfield Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Unger {{sees the}} Christian-Romantic {{tradition}} {{as the one}} tradition that puts the individual {{at the center of}} the world and gives him the tools for the liberation of self and environment. However, similar to the world's religious and philosophical traditions, it fails to provide a lasting answer to the predicament of human existence. This failure is the constant danger that after liberation the self will return to its customary affairs and routine practices. Rather than moving onwards to greater feats of humanity and godlike existence, the individual will allow everyday affairs to again take over. This surrender to habit is directly linked to the defeat of the imagination. Thus metaphysical revolution is needed through a psychology of empowerment and an analysis of social conditions upon which this empowerment relies. Unger’s project <b>begins</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} tracks from Fort Washington Avenue enter Broadway near 171st Street, running {{underneath}} the yard tracks in a double-decker tunnel. A few blocks later, the lower tracks separate to straddle the yard tracks at 168th Street. The local/express split <b>begins</b> <b>here,</b> {{with the local}} tracks coming from the yard and the express tracks coming from Inwood. Contrary to standard practice, the two local tracks are {{in the center and}} the two express tracks are on the outside. Except during late nights, the local service (C) ends at 168th Street, reversing direction on the yard tracks; the A runs to 207th Street at all times, express except during late nights. South of 168th Street, the express (outer) tracks lower below the local tracks, forming another double-decker tunnel, this time under St. Nicholas Avenue.|$|E

500|$|The line {{begins at}} Newcraighall South Junction where the track veers off the former Waverley Route to a {{parallel}} alignment {{just to the}} west which crosses over the former Monktonhall Colliery, part of the Midlothian Coalfield. The first of three double-track dynamic loops <b>begins</b> <b>here</b> and continues for [...] to King's Gate Junction just beyond the Edinburgh Bypass.

500|$|Upon leaving Alfalfa County, US-64 passes into Grant County. The first {{town the}} highway passes through in Grant County is Nash, where it begins a {{concurrency}} with SH-132. This concurrency lasts for [...] before SH-132 splits away. [...] east of this junction, US-64 intersects US-60 and US-81 in a Tjunction. US-81 northbound and US-60 eastbound continue straight, while US-64 eastbound turns south along with southbound US-81 and westbound US-60 (creating a wrong-way concurrency with US-60). The three highways continue south into Garfield County. [...] {{south of the}} Tjunction, US-60/ US-64/ US-81 serve as the eastern terminus of SH-45. This junction marks the highways' entry into the Enid area. The highways serve as the city limit boundary between Enid (to the west) and North Enid (to the east). About [...] south of the SH-45 junction, US-64 splits {{away from the other}} two highways at an interchange where US-64 continues south and US-60/ US-81 take a southwesterly tack. US-64 heads south from the interchange on North 4th Street. At Willow Road, US-64 turns due east; it follows Willow Road for about [...] before turning south on North 30th Street. This street has an parclo interchange with Owen K. Garriott Road, which carries US-412; here, US-64 joins US-412, and the two highways head due east out of Enid as a four-lane expressway. East of Enid, the two routes pass between Breckenridge and Fairmont. South of Garber lies an interchange between US-64/ US-412 and SH-74. SH-15 also <b>begins</b> <b>here,</b> extending north along SH-74. US-64/ US-412 continue east out of Garfield County.|$|E
