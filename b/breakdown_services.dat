5000|$|Casting {{character}} breakdowns, not to {{be confused}} with script breakdowns, are often provided by production to talent agents who submit their clients to casting, which provides a brief summary of character (age, gender, race or ethnicity, personality, situations they may be involved in). A more robust version of this painstaking task can be made through the <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Services,</b> which was founded by former actor Gary Marsh [...] over 40 years ago. This was due to the difficult logistics issues for talent agents to get their actors submitted for acting roles from major film studios and casting directors.|$|E
50|$|The Assault Squadrons were {{initially}} {{a mix of}} Royal Marines and Army serving aboard the ships. The transition to this being all Royal Marines was seen to be essential.The crew for the BARV's would be handed to the Royal Marines with a sergeant, two corporals and marine all qualified vehicle mechanics, responsible for driving and maintaining the tank, and also providing full mechanical <b>breakdown</b> <b>services</b> for all embarked vehicles. The training for the crew would take place at Bovington for driver training and {{at the home of}} the BARV, Instow in North Devon, the Royal Marines amphibious testing centre. There were many occasions when the BARV would break down or get stuck. In 1981 the BARV from Fearless was to be lost at sea off Browndown beach to end up fully submerged. The following year both BARVs would see service during the Falklands War, being the largest land vehicles ashore, with the BARV from Fearless breaking its drivetrain whilst working Blue Beach and spending most of the war not turning a cog.|$|E
40|$|Aftermarket {{services}} in the automotive industry bring profitable advantages to manufacturing firms and are a major enabler to secure customer loyalty by providing value-adding services through the product life-cycle. High uptime of vehicles {{is one of the}} key performance indicators as it increases customer satisfaction which is the fundamentals for long-term relationship with the end-customer. Demand for spare parts is difficult to monitor as <b>breakdown</b> <b>services</b> can occur at an unpredictable time. Therefore, it is challenging for many OEM’s to contribute to high availability of spare parts in a cost efficient way. Today there is data available from connected vehicle technology to facilitate pre-planned services activities and to avoid breakdown situations. The Volvo Group has implemented pre-planning to their aftermarket supply chain but as the amount of pre-planned service activities is not performed in a high degree the company is uncertain about the impact from this concept. The purpose of this thesis was formulated to investigate the impact from higher degree of pre-planned service activities on the aftermarket supply chain in order to identify future performance potential. The thesis was conducted as a case study at the Volvo Group. Three research questions were stated in order to identify scenarios where pre-planning has impact on the spare part control; 1) identify the effect from current spare part control practices and performance in the aftermarket supply chain, 2) identify how pre-planned service activities affect the current spare part control, and 3) identify the opportunities and obstacles for future performance potential on different spare part control scenarios. The current aftermarket supply chain at the Volvo Group was investigated and analysed to find the practices and performance indicators that are affected by the current spare part control and their relevance to higher uptime and decreased lead time, transportation cost and tied-up inventory was evaluated. Characteristics of pre-planning were conducted from literature and benchmarking study from the automotive industry was made to estimate effects from pre-planned service activities on the current spare part control. Historical sales data from two dealers was analysed in order to understand current behaviour from the dealer side. Furthermore, potential pre-planning scenarios and their effects were identified to visualize direct impact from higher degree of pre-planned service activities. The results from this thesis give a clear description on how pre-planned service activities impact the current spare part control. It has the potential to contribut e to higher uptime of the vehicle with reduction of inventory levels at dealers and supporting warehouses, and total transportation cost. Furthermore, it identifies potential planning scenarios where pre-planning will have different impact from different segments of parts. The greatest impact are from faster moving segments of spare parts, that represent the majority of sold parts, and supports the potentials of reduction of total inventory cost, transportation cost, and higher turnover rate at dealers’ stocks...|$|E

40|$|A typical <b>breakdown</b> cover <b>service</b> unit in Belgium has {{to assist}} up to 5 cars {{a day that}} end up with an empty fuel tank. As the range of today’s battery {{electric}} cars is lower than what {{people are used to}} have today, <b>breakdown</b> cover <b>services</b> expect that massive introduction of electric cars will lead to a multiple of EVs ending up with an empty battery. This paper reports about a research project, initiated by a Belgian <b>breakdown</b> cover <b>service,</b> that aimed to design and build a prototype of a fast and an energy efficient intervention car for EVs with empty batteries. For the prototype a CNG van is equipped with a hybrid power system enabling efficient energy injections for electric vehicles with slow as well as fast charging possibilities. The prototype is equipped with charging infrastructure providing mode 1, 2 and 3 charging. The paper starts with a description of the prototype design. The main part gives a detailed comparison of three EV <b>breakdown</b> cover <b>service</b> methods: towing the EV, energy injection on the spot by a diesel genset on a diesel truck and energy injection with the designed prototype. For a typical <b>breakdown</b> cover <b>service</b> day, the prototype turns out to be 12 % faster, consumes 41 % less energy and reduces emissions by 68 % in comparison with towing. status: accepte...|$|R
