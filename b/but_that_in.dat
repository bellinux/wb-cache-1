5|$|Parsifal {{tells of}} his desire to return to Amfortas (""). He relates his long journey, how he wandered for years, {{unable to find a}} path back to the Grail. He had often been forced to fight, but never wielded the Spear in battle. Gurnemanz tells him that the curse {{preventing}} Parsifal from finding his right path has now been lifted, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> his absence Amfortas has never unveiled the Grail, and lack of its sustaining properties has caused the death of Titurel. Parsifal is overcome with remorse, blaming himself for this state of affairs. Gurnemanz tells him that today is the day of Titurel's funeral, and that Parsifal has a great duty to perform. Kundry washes Parsifal's feet and Gurnemanz anoints him with water from the Holy Spring, recognizing him as the pure fool, now enlightened by compassion, and as the new King of the Knights of the Grail.|$|E
25|$|In most countries, {{scholars}} {{agree that}} a coat of arms {{is an indication of}} nobility, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> (<b>in</b> times past) simply assuming a coat of arms did not ennoble the armiger. In certain countries (viz. the Italian states pre-1860), armorial heraldry was not strictly regulated, while titles of nobility were.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 review {{focused on}} {{antidepressants}} and sleep {{found that in}} many people with sleep disorders caused by depression, mirtazapine reduces {{the time it takes}} to fall asleep and increases the quality of sleep, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> some people it can disturb sleep, causing restless leg syndrome in 8 to 28% of people, and in rare cases causes REM sleep behavior disorder.|$|E

25|$|Chase {{also was}} setting up a bank at Pensacola and {{acquiring}} property and developing land and lots in the Pensacola area in particular during his army career. One historian, who also details Chase's private dealings at greater length, notes that Chase's private activities might land him in prison today <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> those days the lines between military, government and private interests were blurred at best.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the year}} of his accession, Nanda {{had to deal with}} a {{seemingly}} small rebellion in northernmost Shan states in present-day Yunnan. The rebellion was put down but it led to rebellions by Ava and Siam in 1584. The rebellion in Ava was put down <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Siam could not be. Between 1584 and 1593, Nanda manically launched five invasions of Siam, all of which failed. The king never had the full support of his other vassals, and could never field {{more than a third of}} the number his father led. By the end of the invasions, his core base of Lower Burma was severely depopulated, and would be unable to stop further breakaways.|$|E
25|$|Hughes and Plath dated {{and then}} were married at St George the Martyr Holborn, on 16 June 1956, four months after they had first met. The date, Bloomsday, was {{purposely}} chosen in honour of James Joyce. Plath's mother was the only wedding guest and she accompanied them on their honeymoon to Benidorm on the Spanish coast. Hughes's biographers note that Plath did not relate her history of depression and suicide attempts to him until much later. Reflecting later in Birthday Letters, Hughes commented that early on he could see chasms of difference between himself and Plath, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> {{the first years of}} their marriage they both felt happy and supported, avidly pursuing their writing careers.|$|E

25|$|The main {{distinction}} of the Early Christian community from its Jewish roots was {{the belief that}} Jesus was the long-awaited Messiah, as in the Confession of Peter, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> itself would not have severed the Jewish connection. Another point of divergence was the questioning by Christians of the continuing applicability of the Law of Moses (the Torah), though the Apostolic Decree of the Apostolic Age of Christianity appears to parallel the Noahide Law of Judaism. The two issues came to be linked in a theological discussion within the Christian community {{as to whether the}} coming of the Messiah (First or Second Coming) annulled either some (Supersessionism), or all (Abrogation of Old Covenant laws), of the Judaic laws in what came to be called a New Covenant.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{thought that}} “to slog on at one spot” on the Somme was “dreadfully lacking in imagination” {{and would have}} {{preferred}} a joint offensive by Russia, Italy and Romania in Spring 1917 to draw off 15 or 20 German divisions, allowing the BEF to “completely smash the Boch line”. Summoned to see Lloyd George (13 November 1916) and asked if Britain could still hope to defeat Germany, Wilson advised him that she could, provided Haig were given enough men to fight “two Sommes at once”, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> reality Haig should be firmly told how many men he was to receive and told to plan accordingly. He thought {{at the end of}} 1916 that both sides were claiming victory from that year’s fighting, but victory “inclined to us”, and that Germany might be driven to sue for peace in 1917.|$|E
25|$|The Palace Guards and the Capital Defense Corps {{received}} minimal formal military training. Western observers {{noted that}} even the elite Capital Defense Corps in the 19th century were not strong at drill. Special branches such as gun and cannon units also received some training. In the 1630s, foreign and indigenous gun regiments not only inhabited the land they had been granted, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the outfitting of a unit of 100 gunners, each man was issued a gun and all necessary supplies. Nonetheless, the skills of Burmese artillery men remained poor. In 1661, Dutch observers at the Burmese capital noted that Burma {{was in need of}} expert cannoneers than cannon. They noted that most of King Pye's arsenal of cannon remained unused because he lacked skilled cannoneers. Such was the lack of skilled artillery men that the French cannoneers captured by Alaungpaya quickly became the leaders of the Burmese artillery corps {{in the second half of}} the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|Spivak also {{introduced}} the terms essentialism and strategic essentialism {{to describe the}} social functions of postcolonialism. The term essentialism denotes the perceptual dangers inherent to reviving subaltern voices in ways that might (over) simplify the cultural identity of heterogeneous social groups, and, thereby, create stereotyped representations of the different identities {{of the people who}} compose a given social group. The term strategic essentialism denotes a temporary, essential group-identity used in the praxis of discourse among peoples. Furthermore, essentialism can occasionally be applied—by the so-described people—to facilitate the subaltern's communication in being heeded, heard, and understood, because a strategic essentialism (a fixed and established subaltern identity) is more readily grasped, and accepted, by the popular majority, in the course of inter-group discourse. The important distinction, between the terms, is that strategic essentialism does not ignore the diversity of identities (cultural and ethnic) in a social group, <b>but</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> its practical function, strategic essentialism temporarily minimizes inter-group diversity to pragmatically support the essential group-identity.|$|E
25|$|Norfolk's low-lying {{land and}} easily eroded cliffs, {{many of which}} are chalk and clay, make it {{vulnerable}} to the sea; the most recent major event was the North Sea flood of 1953. The low-lying section of coast between Kelling and Lowestoft Ness in Suffolk is currently managed by the Environment Agency to protect the Broads from sea flooding. Management policy for the North Norfolk coastline is described in the North Norfolk Shoreline Management Plan, which was published in 2006 but has yet to be accepted by the local authorities. The Shoreline Management Plan states that the stretch of coast will be protected for at least another 50 years, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the face of sea level rise and post-glacial lowering of land levels in the South East, there is an urgent need for further research to inform future management decisions, including the possibility that the sea defences may have to be realigned to a more sustainable position. Natural England have contributed some research into the impacts on the environment of various realignment options. The draft report of their research was leaked to the press, who created great anxiety by reporting that Natural England plan to abandon a large section of the Norfolk Broads, villages and farmland to the sea to save the rest of the Norfolk coastline from the impact of climate change.|$|E
25|$|Festivities {{associated}} {{with the opening of}} the temple were wide-ranging through early 1961. The Ugandan government publication Uganda Argus covered the history and description of the temple in the January 1961 issue and interviews and stories ran on the Ugandan Broadcasting service on radio. Events on site began on the 13th with a unity feast with Hands of the Cause Musa Banani, John Robarts, Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir and Chairman of the regional assembly Ali Nakhkajvani and vice-chairman O]oro Epyeru giving talks. The temple was dedicated on 14th led by Hand of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum where there was a viewing of portraits of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. And the public inaugural service was held on the 15th. Over 1500 people attended. Among the Bahá'ís were some 225 African Bahá'ís from Uganda, Kenya, Tanganyika, Ruanda Urundi, Ethiopia, Northern Rhodesia, Swaziland, and South Africa; some 90 Persian Baha'is, sixty-two of whom flew from Tehran; the British national assembly, the mother assembly to that of Central and East Africa, sent one believer from each of its regions - England, Scotland and Wales, as well as one from Ireland; the American national assembly sent one of its members, Amos Gibson, himself a pioneer among the American Indian peoples. Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga was unable to attend due to political turmoil in Cameroon Olinga was attempting to help them with. A choir, especially selected from among Kampala's singers and directed by Peter Wingard of Makerere College sang music and readings offered were from the Old and New Testaments and the Qur'an, plus a number of prayers and readings from the Bahá'í writings in Arabic, Persian, Ateso, Swahili, Acholi, Luganda and English. Following the public meeting a reception was held for representatives of the Governor and the Kabaka of Buganda, together with the Mayor of Kampala at which Ruhiyyih Khanum shared a story that Shoghi Effendi had traveled through the region in the early 1920s. Following the dedication Ruhiyyih Khanum and chairman Nakhkajvani embarked on 15 days of visiting Bahá'ís through Uganda and Kenya including staying in their homes, dedicating two schools, ate native food, and were honored with traditional songs and dances. Khanum suggested repeatedly that the Ugandan's own folklore, their traditions and their native songs and music should not be discarded, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> a society of unity in diversity they were to preserve and develop these as their contribution in enriching the spiritual and material life of human society as well as noting the equality of the sexes and that women should take equal part in administration of the religion.|$|E
