25|$|A second {{explosion}} at the Park Kultury station followed at approximately 8:38am, caused by another female, {{who at the}} time of the first explosion was riding another train from Yugo-Zapadnaya towards Ulitsa Podbelskogo station in the same direction as the first train. At the time of first explosion, the second train had stopped in the tunnel between Frunzenskaya and Park Kultury stations. It was announced over the speakers that due to technical problems, the train would have to unload the passengers at the next stop. About 40 minutes later, the train reached the station, and once its doors opened, the second female suspect detonated the second explosion, killing fourteen commuters. Panic included stampedes at both stations, as commuters attempted to escape. The second attack was carried out by a dark-haired woman with the equivalent of 2kg of TNT strapped to her waist. Both bombs were packed with metal nuts, <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws,</b> to increase the destructive impact of the blasts.|$|E
50|$|A screw {{is a type}} of fastener, {{sometimes}} {{similar to}} a bolt (see Differentiation between <b>bolt</b> <b>and</b> <b>screw</b> below), typically made of metal, and characterized by a helical ridge, known as a male thread (external thread) or just thread.|$|R

50|$|The distinctions {{above are}} {{enforced}} in the controlled vocabulary of standards organizations. Nevertheless, there are sometimes {{differences between the}} controlled vocabulary and the natural language use of the words by machinists, auto mechanics and others. These differences reflect linguistic evolution shaped by the changing of technology over centuries. The words <b>bolt</b> <b>and</b> <b>screw</b> have both existed since before today's modern mix of fastener types existed, and the natural usage of those words has evolved retronymously {{in response to the}} technological change. (That is, the use of words as names for objects changes as the objects change.) Non-threaded fasteners predominated until the advent of practical, inexpensive screw-cutting in the early 19th century. The basic meaning of the word screw has long involved the idea of a helical screw thread, but the Archimedes <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> the <b>screw</b> gimlet (like a corkscrew) preceded the fastener.|$|R
5000|$|Raymond is {{best known}} as the lead {{designer}} of the DC-3, [...] "The Plane That Changed the World," [...] the first airliner that could break even hauling passengers without a government subsidy and without carrying mail. The military equivalent of the DC-3 was the C-47. In Europe, the DC-3 was known as the [...] "Dakota." [...] Raymond's grandson Stephen has said: [...] "In the DC-3, he did almost everything. He knew every <b>bolt</b> <b>and</b> <b>screw</b> in that plane." [...] About 10,600 DC-3s and C-47s were eventually built between 1934 and 1945, making it the most produced airliner of all time. At the time of Raymond's death, about 2,000 DC-3s were still flying and about 400 were still in commercial service.|$|R
50|$|The {{stress and}} shear in a rivet is {{analyzed}} like a bolted joint. However, {{it is not}} wise to combine rivets with <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws</b> in the same joint. Rivets fill the hole where they are installed to establish a very tight fit (often called interference fit). It is difficult or impossible to obtain such a tight fit with other fasteners. The result is that rivets in the same joint with loose fasteners carry more of the load—they are effectively more stiff. The rivet can then fail before it can redistribute load to the other loose fit fasteners like <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws.</b> This often causes catastrophic failure of the joint when the fasteners unzip. In general, a joint composed of similar fasteners is the most efficient because all fasteners reach capacity simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Because {{there is}} {{effectively}} a head on {{each end of}} an installed rivet, it can support tension loads (loads parallel to the axis of the shaft); however, {{it is much more}} capable of supporting shear loads (loads perpendicular to the axis of the shaft). <b>Bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>screws</b> are better suited for tension applications.|$|E

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour {{of single}} shear bolted connections, double shear <b>bolted</b> connections <b>and</b> single shear <b>screwed</b> connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures {{has been investigated}} in this study. The current design rules on <b>bolted</b> <b>and</b> <b>screwed</b> connections of thin sheet steels for cold-formed steel structures are applicable for ambient temperature condition only. These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperature conditions. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for <b>bolted</b> <b>and</b> <b>screwed</b> connections of cold-formed steel structures at elevated temperatures. A total of 30 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of the thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures, and also to determine the critical temperatures for connection tests. A total of 510 tests on single shear bolted connections, double shear <b>bolted</b> connections <b>and</b> single shear <b>screwed</b> connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures was performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the predicted values calculated from the North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for coldformed steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the reduced material properties of the thin sheet steels were used due to the deterioration of material at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. Finite element models for single shear bolted connections, double shear <b>bolted</b> connections <b>and</b> single shear <b>screwed</b> connections were developed and verified against the experimental results. Explicit dynamic analysis technique {{was used in the}} numerical analyses. Extensive parametric studies that included 490 finite element specimens were carried out using the verified finite element models to evaluate the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures. Design equations for bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as design equations for tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections were proposed based on both the experimental and the numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C. The bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections obtained from the test specimens and the finite element analyses were compared with the predicted strengths calculated using the proposed design equations and also compared with the design strengths calculated using the current North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications with consideration of the reduced material properties at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the proposed design equations are generally more accurate and reliable in predicting the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures than the current design rules. The reliability of the current and proposed design rules was evaluated using reliability analysis. The proposed design equations are suitable for <b>bolted</b> <b>and</b> <b>screwed</b> connections assembled using thin sheet steels of thickness ranged from 0. 35 to 3. 20 mm. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

50|$|The first {{modification}} was a new, {{more powerful}} powertrain.

Both engines were lighter and {{smaller than the}} Saurer VBLDd engine used in 7TP. Because of that the armour could be extended and more space could be redirected to the battle compartment. An additional bonus {{was the fact that}} both engines were water-cooled which allowed for the rear grille of 7TP to be replaced with solid armoured plates. Another modification planned for the 9TP was switching from <b>bolted</b> <b>and</b> <b>screwed</b> to welded armoured plates, which further strengthened the hull and allowed to save additional 210 kilograms, enough to further strengthen the armour and widen the tracks from 267 mm to 320 mm.|$|R

30|$|A {{mechanical}} study {{investigating the}} use of two different methods (grub <b>and</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>screws)</b> to secure external fixation half pins to circular frames. A four part experiment: (1) Grub <b>and</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>screws</b> were used to secure half pins in Taylor Spatial frames. Loosening torques were measured using a calibrated torque wrench. (2) Using universal testing machine (UTM), axial loading was applied to establish thresholds for loosening in grub <b>and</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>screw</b> constructs. (3) We established the application torque to produce failure at the head–driver interface using these two methods. (4) Grub <b>and</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>screw</b> constructs were created controlling torque. Using UTM, axial loading was applied to establish thresholds for loosening. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS v 20.0. 0. (1) Higher torque is employed when bolt rather than grub screws is used to secure half pins on Rancho cubes (p <  0.05). (2) Loading threshold for loosening is higher in bolt screw constructs when the torque applied to secure the constructs is not controlled (p <  0.05). (3) Torque required for failure at the head–driver interface was 5.3  Nm for grub <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> 9.9  Nm for bolts. (4) Loading threshold for loosening is higher in grub screw constructs when the same torque was applied to secure them (p <  0.05). Bolt screws can be employed to secure the half pin–frame interface. They offer good stability and reduce failure at the head–driver interface. Further {{research is needed to}} determine the mechanical properties of such constructs in vivo.|$|R
