5|$|In early December 2014 it was {{announced}} that the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai would host the final of the Indian Super League. It was also announced that tickets for the final would be available online from 8 December 2014. On 18 December 2014, one day after the semi-finals had concluded, it was reported that a packed crowd was expected for the final. According to the owner of the DY Patil Stadium, Vijay Patil, the stands during the Indian Super League final will <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> full as they were during the 2008 Indian Premier League Final.|$|E
5|$|Negation is {{done with}} the adverb not, which precedes the main verb and follows an {{auxiliary}} verb. A contracted form of not -n't {{can be used as}} an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to <b>be.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English I don't know him is the correct answer to the question Do you know him?, but not *I know him not, although this construction may be found in older English.|$|E
5|$|Tigers {{have been}} studied in the wild {{using a variety of}} techniques. The populations of tigers have been {{estimated}} using plaster casts of their pugmarks, although this method was criticised as being inaccurate. More recent attempts have been made using camera trapping and studies on DNA from their scat, while radio collaring has been used to track tigers in the wild. Tiger spray has been found to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> good, or better, as a source of DNA as scat.|$|E

5|$|Annoyed by Peter's {{constant}} shocking, Brian professes his discomfort by referencing {{his anger}} after O. J. Simpson {{was acquitted of}} charges in the O. J. Simpson murder case. After Lois expresses her hope for the restaurant to be successful, Stewie sarcastically states that it will <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> successful as Liza Minnelli's Playboy photoshoot. Returning home from the restaurant, Peter and Lois decide to watch an episode of Maude, but {{the length of the}} opening theme song causes Peter to become fatigued by the show. Once the restaurant begins hemorrhaging money, Peter decides to shoot a commercial parodying M. Night Shyamalan's 1999 film The Sixth Sense. After Joe's handicapped friends take over the restaurant, Peter expresses his discomfort about the restaurant's coolness to Lois by retrieving a picture of American actor Mark Harmon and showing it to Lois in an attempt to make her understand his concern.|$|E
5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> likely to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true. This novel epistemological argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, {{is more likely to be}} selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Wave Race 64 was {{released}} in China for the iQue Player console. A 1-hour demo of the game was also included with the console. On August 6, 2007, the game {{was released}} on the Wii's Virtual Console. Unlike the Nintendo 64 version, the Virtual Console release does not feature Kawasaki banners due to expired licensing deals. These were replaced by Wii and Nintendo DS advertisements. However, when the game was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2016, the Kawasaki banners were restored. The Virtual Console versions of the game were generally very well received, with reviewers considering the game to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> much fun as {{it was on the}} Nintendo 64.|$|E

5|$|In Asia, {{the normal}} diet {{includes}} rice and noodles {{as the main}} energy source, making their elimination difficult. Therefore, the MCT-oil form of the diet, which allows more carbohydrate, has proved useful. In India, religious beliefs commonly affect the diet: some patients are vegetarians, will not eat root vegetables or avoid beef. The Indian ketogenic diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children. The low-fat, high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their ketogenic diets typically have a lower ketogenic ratio (1:1) than in America and Europe. However, they appear to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> effective.|$|E
5|$|This {{eruption}} style {{can take}} the form of either lava flows, spreading across the floor of the paterae, or lava lakes. Except for observations by Galileo during its seven close flybys, {{it can be difficult to}} tell the difference between a lava lake and a lava flow eruption on a patera floor, due to inadequate resolution and similar thermal emission characteristics. Intra-patera lava flow eruptions, such as the Gish Bar Patera eruption in 2001, can <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> voluminous as those seen spreading out across the Ionian plains. Flow-like features have also been observed within a number of paterae, like Camaxtli Patera, suggesting that lava flows periodically resurface their floors.|$|E
5|$|While each façade of Quattro Canti is {{pleasing}} to the eye, as a scheme {{it is both}} out of proportion with the limited size of the piazza and, like most other examples of early Sicilian Baroque, can be considered provincial, naive and heavy-handed, compared with later developments. Whatever its merit, {{it is evident that}} during the 17th century, the Baroque style {{in the hands of the}} local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised variation on the mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to Sicily, but occurred as far afield as Bavaria, and Russia, where Naryshkin Baroque would <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.|$|E

5|$|Arriving at Petrograd's Finland Station, Lenin gave {{a speech}} to Bolshevik {{supporters}} condemning the Provisional Government and again calling for a continent-wide European proletarian revolution. Over the following days, he spoke at Bolshevik meetings, lambasting those who wanted reconciliation with the Mensheviks and revealing his April Theses, an outline of {{his plans for the}} Bolsheviks, which he had written on the journey from Switzerland. He publicly condemned both the Mensheviks and the Social Revolutionaries – who dominated the influential Petrograd Soviet – for supporting the Provisional Government, denouncing them as traitors to socialism. Considering the government to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> imperialist as the Tsarist regime, he advocated immediate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary, rule by soviets, the nationalisation of industry and banks, and the state expropriation of land, all with the intention of establishing a proletariat government and pushing toward a socialist society. By contrast, the Mensheviks believed that Russia was insufficiently developed to transition to socialism and accused Lenin of trying to plunge the new Republic into civil war. Over the coming months, he campaigned for his policies, attending the meetings of the Bolshevik Central Committee, prolifically writing for the Bolshevik newspaper Pravda, and giving public speeches in Petrograd aimed at converting workers, soldiers, sailors, and peasants to his cause.|$|E
5|$|The exiled prisoners from Earth {{form the}} Confederacy of Man in the Koprulu Sector. A de facto plutocracy, the Confederacy's inner {{workings}} are elaborated {{on in the}} novels Liberty's Crusade, Speed of Darkness and Nova. Taking {{the role of the}} primary antagonistic faction in StarCrafts Episode I, the Confederacy is shown as the most powerful faction in the sector at the beginning of StarCraft; in the novels, it is depicted as being brutal towards the public and corrupt at the highest levels on its capital Tarsonis. The player gets to control a division of the Confederate Security Forces in the prequel shareware campaign for StarCraft. Due to the brutality of the regime, it is opposed by a variety of rebel groups and is eventually overthrown by the Sons of Korhal. The Sons of Korhal, a rebel group led by Arcturus Mengsk that the player controls during Episode I of StarCraft, form the Terran Dominion to replace the destroyed Confederacy, with the planet Korhal IV as the capital. The Dominion is an autocracy with Mengsk as its emperor. The Dominion's operations are built on in The Dark Templar Saga series of novels. Although Mengsk sees himself as a benevolent dictator, he is shown to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> harsh as his predecessors.|$|E
