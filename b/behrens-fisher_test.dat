40|$|The Behrens-Fisher {{problem is}} a {{well-known}} hypothesis testing problem in statistics concerning two-sample mean comparison. In this article, we confirm one conjecture in Eaton and Olshen (1972), which provides stochastic bounds for the multivariate <b>Behrens-Fisher</b> <b>test</b> statistic under the null hypothesis. We also extend their results on the stochastic ordering of random quotients to the arbitrary finite dimensional case. This work {{can also be seen}} as a generalization of Hsu (1938) that provided the bounds for the univariate Behrens-Fisher problem. The results obtained in this article can be used to derive a testing procedure for the multivariate Behrens-Fisher problem that strongly controls the Type I error...|$|E
40|$|The unique {{problems}} encountered {{when analyzing}} weather data sets - that is, measurements taken while conducting a meteorological experiment- have forced statisticians {{to reconsider the}} conventional analysis methods and investigate permutation test procedures. The problems encountered when analyzing weather data sets are simulated for a Monte Carlo study, {{and the results of}} the parametric and permutation t-tests are compared with regard to significance level, power, and the average coilfidence interval length. Seven population distributions are considered - three are variations of the normal distribution, and the others the gamma, the lognormal, the rectangular and empirical distributions. The normal distribution contaminated with zero measurements is also simulated. In those simulated situations in which the variances are unequal, the permutation test procedure was performed using other test statistics, namely the Scheffe, Welch and <b>Behrens-Fisher</b> <b>test</b> statistics.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{permutation}} tests based on studentized statistics are asymptotically exact of size [alpha] also under certain extended non-i. i. d. null hypotheses. To demonstrate the principle {{the results are}} applied to the generalized two-sample <b>Behrens-Fisher</b> problem for <b>testing</b> equality of the means under general non-parametric heterogeneous error distributions. Within this setting we propose a permutation version of the Welch test which {{is an extension of}} Pitman's two-sample permutation test. These results are special cases of a conditional central limit theorem for studentized permutation statistics which also applies to asymptotic power functions. <b>Behrens-Fisher</b> problem Permutation <b>test</b> Permutation statistic Conditional central limit theorem Survival test...|$|R
40|$|We have {{designed}} a statistical test that eliminates {{the assumption of}} equal group variances from one-way analysis of variance. This test is preferable to the standard technique of trial-and-error transformation and can {{be shown to be}} an extension of the <b>Behrens-Fisher</b> T <b>test</b> to the case of three or more means. We suggest that this procedure be used in most applications where the one-way analysis of variance has traditionally been applied to biological data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a new online algorithm for automated detection of load changes, which provides statistical evidence of station-ary changes in traffic load. To this end, we perform continuous measure-ments {{of the link}} load, then look for clusters in the dataset and finally apply the <b>Behrens-Fisher</b> hypothesis <b>testing</b> methodology. The algorithm serves to identify which links deviate from the typical load behavior. The rest of the links are considered normal and no intervention of the net-work manager is required. Due to the automated selection of abnormal links, the Operations Expenditure (OPEX) is reduced. The algorithm {{has been applied to}} a set of links in the Spanish National Research and Education Network (RedIRIS) showing good results...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The study investigates {{relations}} among Norwegian-American ethnicity, ownership of ethnic articles, and selected other factors. Articles include clothing, textiles, and certain household objects. Hypotheses were drawn predicting relations between ethnic article ownership and ethnicity as expressed by ethnic practices and attitudes, and between ethnic article ownership and generation in America (first {{as compared to}} second and second as compared to third), travel to the mother country, communication with relatives, marital status (endogamy as compared to exogamy), educational level, and social class level. Measures used were developed for the study. Data were collected by means of questionnaires mailed to a selected sample of married women of Norwegian descent or whose husbands were of Norwegian descent, and were analyzed for statistical significance by means of simple correlation and the <b>Behrens-Fisher</b> <b>test.</b> Ethnic article ownership {{was found to be}} significantly related to ethnicity as expressed by ethnic practices, and to generation in America (first as compared to second), travel to the mother country, and communication with relatives. No significant relations were found to obtain in the cases of ethnicity as expressed by ethnic attitudes, or of generation in America (second as compared to third), marital status (endogamy as compared to exogamy), educational level, and social class level...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Behrens-Fisher</b> problem {{concerns}} <b>testing</b> {{the equality}} {{of the means of}} two normal populations with possibly different variances. The null hypothesis in this problem induces a statistical model for which the likelihood function may have more than one local maximum. We show that such multimodality contradicts the null hypothesis in the sense that if this hypothesis is true then the probability of multimodality converges to zero when both sample sizes tend to infinity. Additional results include a finite-sample bound on the probability of multimodality under the null and asymptotics for the probability of multimodality under the alternative...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was determination of psychometrics specifications of this scale. Methods: This was a methodological, applied and validity assessment study. One thousand students at 7 to 12 years of age in primary school in Tehran city were selected by cluster sampling. Then the students' teachers were asked to complete rating scale to consider behavior of their student. Thirty staff members of sample group were retested with SNAP-IV and was interviewed with DSM-IV. Data were analyzed by factor analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient, Kolmogrov-Smirnov and <b>Behrens-Fisher</b> t <b>tests.</b> Findings: Criterion validity was 55. Factor analysis was detected 2 factors that explain 71 of the total variance. Reliability coefficient by test-retest was 88, internal consistency coefficient was 95, and Split-half coefficient was 73. Cut-off point in scale and subscale was 2. 08, 2. 10, and 2. 37 respectively. Conclusion: The SNAP-IV rating scales have fit psychometrics characters. Therefore, it is useable in screen study and therapeutic conditioning...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new method for {{constructing}} exact distribution-free tests (and con…dence intervals) for variables that can generate {{more than two}} possible outcomes. This method separates the search for an exact test from the goal to create a nonrandomized test. Randomization is used to extend any exact test relating to means of variables with …nitely many outcomes to variables with outcomes belonging to a given bounded set. Tests in terms of variance and covariance are reduced to tests relating to means. Randomness is then eliminated in a separate step. This method is used to create con…dence intervals for the di¤erence between two means (or variances) and tests of stochastic inequality and correlation.

40|$|In {{this work}} we are {{concerned}} with the problem of testing the equality of the means from the two populations for the case where the population covariance matrices are unequal. Well-known problem frequently occurring in applied statistics, called the Behrens-Fisher problem. This is widely used in economy, social sciences and medicine. We concentrate mainly on multivariate case. We study variety of possible approaches, bayesian, parametric, nonparametric, with particular solutions. At the close we mention one of possible solutions of generalized multivariate <b>Behrens-Fisher</b> problem, Mack-Wolfe <b>test.</b> A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted in order to illustrate their properties for different dimensions, the degree of heteroscedasticity, sample sizes and correlation coefficients. For comparison we mention classical two sample multivariate Hotelling T 2. We demonstrate impact of nonnormality by estimating the type I error and power for selected solutions. Finally we use real data form Forest inventory in the Czech Republic 2001 - 2004 and we present the necessity of solution of this problem in practice.

40|$|The {{generalized}} p-value method {{introduced by}} Tsui and Weerahandi [1989. Generalized p-values in significance testing of hypotheses {{in the presence}} of nuisance parameters. J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 84 (406), 602 - 607] has been successfully used to provide small sample solutions for many hypothesis testing problems when nuisance parameters are present. Simulation studies show that generalized p-values have similar distributional properties as ordinary p-values. It is desirable to study theoretical properties of generalized p-values. Given a sample d, let p(d) be the generalized p-value for the <b>Behrens-Fisher</b> problem of <b>testing</b> the difference of two independent normal distribution means with possibly unequal distributional variances, as given in Tsui and Weerahandi [1989. Generalized p-values in significance testing of hypotheses {{in the presence of}} nuisance parameters. J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 84 (406), 602 - 607]. We derive a closed form expression to show that, for small samples, the probability P(p(d) [less-than-or-equals, slant]r) is approximately {{less than or equal to}} r, for 0 [less-than-or-equals, slant]r[less-than-or-equals, slant] 0. 5.

40|$|The several sample {{case of the}} {{so-called}} nonparametric Behrens-Fisher problem in repeated measures designs is considered. That is, even under the null hypothesis, the marginal distribution functions in the different groups may have different shapes, and are not assumed to be equal. Moreover, {{the continuity of the}} marginal distribution functions is not required so that data with ties and, particularly, ordered categorical data are covered by this model. A multiple relative treatment effect is defined which can be estimated by using the mid-ranks of the observations within pairwise samples. The asymptotic distribution of this estimator is derived, along with a consistent estimator of its asymptotic covariance matrix. In addition, a multiple contrast test and related simultaneous confidence intervals for the relative marginal effects are derived and compared to rank-based Wald-type and ANOVA-type statistics. Simulations show that the ANOVA-type statistic and the multiple contrast test appear to maintain the pre-assigned level of the test quite accurately (even for rather small sample sizes) while the Wald-type statistic leads, as expected, to somewhat liberal decisions. Regarding the power, none of the statistics is uniformly superior. A real data set illustrates the application. <b>Behrens-Fisher</b> problem Rank <b>test</b> Nonparametric hypothesis Ordered categorical data Ties Repeated measures design...|$|R
40|$|The authors thank Professor Kjell Doksum for useful suggestions, {{and thank}} Wei Zheng for {{providing}} the microarray data and helpful discussions. The generalized p-value method introduced by Tsui and Weerahandi (1989) {{has been used}} to successfully provide finite sample solutions for many hypothesis testing problems when no solutions are available using the usual approach. Although simulation studies show that generalized p-values have similar distributional properties as ordinary p-values, no one has yet developed theoretical properties of generalized p-values. This paper provides some theoretical distributional properties of the generalized p-value for the <b>Behrens-Fisher</b> problem of <b>testing</b> the difference of two independent normal distribution means with possibly unequal distributional variances. We show why the probability that the generalized p-value for the Behrens-Fisher problem is less than a given value r in (0, 0. 5), is approximately r. We use this theoretical result to obtain a multiple testing procedure based on generalized p-values, which controls the false discovery rate (FDR). In particular, we introduce a theoretically valid testing procedure that controls FDR in simultaneously <b>testing</b> several <b>Behrens-Fisher</b> problems. Our procedure to control FDR is an extension of the important work of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995), which is based on ordinary p-values. Our proof is constructive and concise and it shows clearly the essential step that makes the FDR result holds. It should be useful for development of further results. Data from a microarray experiment are used to illustrate our method. Keywords: Generalized p-value; Behrens-Fisher problem; False Discovery Rate...|$|R
