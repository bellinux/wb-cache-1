5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, small {{patches of}} pure water ice with an albedo {{as high as}} 80% are found {{on the surface of}} Callisto, surrounded by much darker material. High-resolution Galileo images showed the bright patches to be predominately located on elevated surface features: crater rims, scarps, ridges and knobs. They are likely to <b>be</b> <b>thin</b> water frost deposits. Dark material usually lies in the lowlands surrounding and mantling bright features and appears to be smooth. It often forms patches up to 5km across within the crater floors and in the intercrater depressions.|$|E
5|$|The Kagawa Prefectural Government Hall on {{the island}} of Shikoku was {{completed}} in 1958. Its expressive construction could be likened to the Daibutsu style seen at the Tōdai-ji in Nara. The columns on the elevation bore only vertical loads so Tange was able to design them to <b>be</b> <b>thin,</b> maximising the surfaces for glazing. Although the hall has been called one of his finest projects, it drew criticism {{at the time of its}} construction for relying too heavily on tradition.|$|E

5|$|Fruit : A capsule that {{is usually}} loculicidal (splitting along the locules) as in the Lilioideae, but {{occasionally}} septicidal (splitting between them, along the separating septa) in the Calachortoideae and wind dispersed, although the Medeoleae form berries (baccate). The seeds may be flat, oblong, angular, , ellipsoid or globose (spherical), or compressed with a well developed epidermis. The exterior may be smooth or roughened, with a wing or raphe (ridge), aril or one to two tails, rarely hairy, but may be dull or shiny {{and the lack of}} a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as Allioideae that were previously included in this family, and striate (parallel longitudinally ridged) in the Steptopoideae. The hilum (scar) is generally inconspicuous. The bitegmic (separate testa and tegmen) seed coat itself may <b>be</b> <b>thin,</b> suberose (like cork), or crustaceous (hard or brittle). The endosperm is abundant, cartilaginous (fleshy) or horny and contains oils and aleurone but not starch (non-farinaceous). Its cells are polyploid (triploid or pentaploid, depending on the embryo sac type). The embryo is small (usually less than one quarter of seed volume), axile (radially sectioned), linear (longer than broad) or rarely rudimentary (tiny relative to endosperm) depending on placentation type, and straight, bent, curved or curled at the upper end.|$|E

25|$|Anorexia nervosa is {{an eating}} {{disorder}} that is characterized by low appetite and {{a strong desire to}} lose weight, <b>be</b> <b>thin,</b> and fears of gaining weight. People suffering from anorexia nervosa frequently have an abnormally low body weight, which can cause muscle dysfunction and weak osmoregulation. It can also accompany emotional symptoms such as depression.|$|E
25|$|Anorexia nervosa, often {{referred}} to simply as anorexia, is an eating disorder characterized by low weight, fear of gaining weight, and {{a strong desire to}} <b>be</b> <b>thin,</b> resulting in food restriction. Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are in fact underweight. If asked they usually deny they have a problem with low weight. Often they weigh themselves frequently, eat only small amounts, and only eat certain foods. Some will exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to produce weight loss. Complications may include osteoporosis, infertility and heart damage, among others. Women will often stop having menstrual periods.|$|E

25|$|Tāwari is a {{rich source}} of nectar, which is often so {{abundant}} that bees produce monofloral honey, that is the honey is chiefly made of nectar from Tāwari flowers. Tāwari honey is regularly for sale from food shops in New Zealand. The nectar contains a lot of fructose and much water. The honey may <b>be</b> <b>thin</b> as a consequence, but nonetheless crystallizes quickly. The honey has a light colour and tastes a bit like butterscotch. It contains relatively few pollen, and if at least 20% of the pollen is Tāwari, it can be marketed as Tāwari honey. Bark can produce a black dye that is known to be used on flax. Māori people use the flowers to make necklaces and other adornments to be worn at festivities.|$|E
25|$|Outcomes have {{generally}} indicated that early onset of puberty in girls can be psychologically damaging. The {{main reason for}} this detrimental effect {{is the issue of}} body image. As they physically develop, gaining weight in several areas of the body, early-maturing girls usually look larger than girls who have not yet entered puberty. A result of the social pressure to <b>be</b> <b>thin,</b> the early-maturing girls develop a negative view of their body image. In addition, boys may tease the girls about their visible breasts, forcing the early-maturing girl to hide her breasts by dressing differently. Embarrassment about a more developed body may also result in the refusal to undress for gym. These experiences lead to lower self-esteem, more depression and poorer body image in these early-maturing girls.|$|E
25|$|The attack {{started on}} the night of 30 August, taking {{advantage}} of a full moon. From the start, things went wrong for Rommel; the RAF spotted the Axis vehicle concentrations and unleashed several air attacks on them. Fairey Albacores of the Royal Navy dropped flares to illuminate targets for Vickers Wellington medium bombers and for the artillery; also, the minefields that were thought to <b>be</b> <b>thin</b> turned out to be deep. The British units covering the minefields were the two brigades of the 7th Armoured Division (7th Motor and 4th Armoured), whose orders were to inflict maximum casualties before retiring. This they did, and the Axis losses began to rise. They included General Walther Nehring, the Afrika Korps commander, wounded in an air raid, and General Georg von Bismarck, commander of the 21st Panzer Division, killed by a mine explosion.|$|E

500|$|Actual amounts fed vary by {{the size}} of the horse, the age of the horse, the climate, and the work to which the animal is put. [...] In addition, genetic factors play a role. [...] Some animals are {{naturally}} easy keepers (good doers), which means that they can thrive on small amounts of food and are prone to obesity and other health problems if overfed. [...] Others are hard keepers (poor doers), meaning that they are prone to <b>be</b> <b>thin</b> and require considerably more food to maintain a healthy weight.|$|E
500|$|For the cape, {{director}} Christopher Nolan {{wanted to}} have a [...] "flowing cloak... that blows and flows as in so many great graphic novels". Hemming's team created the cape out of their own version of parachute nylon that had electrostatic flocking, a process shared with the team by the British Ministry of Defence. The process was used by the London police force to minimize night vision detection. The cape was topped by a cowl, which was designed by Nolan, Hemming, and costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard. The cowl was created to <b>be</b> <b>thin</b> enough to allow motion but thick enough to avoid wrinkling when Bale turned his head in the Batsuit. Churchyard explained the cowl had been designed to show [...] "a man who has angst", so his character would be revealed through the mask.|$|E
500|$|Fleming's {{last two}} books, The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights, were {{published}} posthumously. The Man with the Golden Gun was published {{eight months after}} Fleming's death and had not been through the full editing process by Fleming. As a result, the novel was thought by publishing company Jonathan Cape to <b>be</b> <b>thin</b> and [...] "feeble". The publishers had passed the manuscript to Kingsley Amis to read on holiday, although they did not use his suggestions. Fleming's biographer Henry Chandler observes that the novel [...] "received polite and rather sad reviews, recognising that the book had effectively been left half-finished, and as such did not represent Fleming {{at the top of}} his game". The final Bond book, containing two short stories, Octopussy and The Living Daylights, was published in Britain on 23 June 1966.|$|E

500|$|In 1934, Mitchell and {{the design}} staff decided to use a semi-elliptical wing shape to solve two {{conflicting}} requirements. The wing needed to <b>be</b> <b>thin,</b> to avoid creating too much drag, while still able to house a retractable undercarriage, plus armament and ammunition. An elliptical planform is the most efficient aerodynamic shape for an untwisted wing, leading to the lowest amount of induced drag. The ellipse was skewed so that the centre of pressure, which occurs at the quarter-chord position, aligned with the main spar, thus preventing the wings from twisting. Mitchell has sometimes been accused of copying the wing shape of the Heinkel He 70, which first flew in 1932; but as Beverley Shenstone, the aerodynamicist on Mitchell's team, explained: [...] "Our wing was much thinner and had quite a different section {{to that of the}} Heinkel. In any case it would have been simply asking for trouble to have copied a wing shape from an aircraft designed for an entirely different purpose." ...|$|E
500|$|The overall {{shape of}} the blade ranges from oblong (tapering at the ends but about the same width throughout) to {{lanceolate}} (slightly wider a short distance above the base, tapering to a point at the apex).

The blade is cut into 5 to 15pairs of pinnae (possibly as low as 3 or as high as 20 in unusual specimens), which are themselves deeply lobed or further subdivided into pinnules. The lower pinnae are stalked, while the upper pinnae are not. They are variable in shape, tending to have a squared-off or very broadly curved base, and are typically widest {{at or near the}} base. The acroscopic lobe or pinnule nearest the rachis (located on the apical side of each pinna) tends to be enlarged, and the pinnae are toothed. They vary from [...] in length and [...] at the middle of the frond.|$|E
500|$|M.regularis {{is found}} in the {{south-western}} coastal regions of Australia. Nests have been recorded in the towns of Albany, Denmark, Nornalup, Manjimup, Pemberton and around the Margaret River in south Western Australia, Kangaroo Island in South Australia and Portland in Victoria. The ant prefers to inhabit a variety of rural environments, including woodland, open forests, dry marri forests, tree heath and granite mountains. In particular, it is a dominant species in Eucalyptus woodland, especially when E.diversicolor, E.gomphocephala and E.marginata trees are present. M.regularis colonies do not form mounds, but rather nest in damp, black soil or under large stones and logs with 100 to 200 workers present. These colonies are usually found at altitudes of between [...] above sea level. Excavated incipient nests (young colonies beginning to develop) show small chambers [...] wide, where logs and stones form the roof of the cell. The ground is flat with walls continuous on all sides; the outer walls tend to <b>be</b> <b>thin,</b> as they are situated near the edges of a log or stone. Most nests have a gallery which descends further into the ground, usually around [...] and forms a small and more irregular chamber.|$|E
