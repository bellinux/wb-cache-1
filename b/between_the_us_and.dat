40|$|The {{fundamental}} study {{focuses on}} estimating {{the volatility of}} exchange rate returns <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>US</b> dollar <b>and</b> African emerging currencies based on GAS-GARCH-student t model. Moreover, we employ the GAS-GARCH-student-t to update the time-varying parameter using the scaled score function of the likelihood function. Empirically, the paper utilises daily exchange rate data <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>US</b> dollar <b>and</b> three African emerging currencies (Egyptian Pound, Nigerian Naira, and South African Rand) spanning from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2014. Clearly, {{it is found that}} the exchange rate returns <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>US</b> dollar <b>and</b> African emerging currencies undergo from the volatility clustering phenomenon and that there exists a highly time-varying variance in the exchange rate series that has to be appropriately dealt with, while modelling exchange rates return series. Thus, we can show the existence of high dependence <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>US</b> dollar <b>and</b> <b>the</b> African emerging currencies which explain the economic and financial dependency <b>between</b> <b>the</b> USA and the African emerging countries. exchange rates; US dollar; Africa; emerging currencies; exchange rate volatility; GAS-GARCH-Student-t; USA; United States; modelling; Egyptian Pound; Egypt; Nigerian Naira; Nigeria; South African Rand; South Africa; emerging economies; economic dependency; financial dependency...|$|R
