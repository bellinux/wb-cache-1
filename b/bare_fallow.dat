40|$|In {{the context}} of climate change, one {{mitigation}} technique currently investigated {{is the use of}} pyrogenic organic carbon (PyOC) -which is biomass turned into charcoal- to sequester carbon in soils with the hypothesis that PyOC is persistent and will not be biodegraded (or mineralized). In this study, we use the unique opportunity offered by five long term <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> (LTBF) experiments across Europe (Askov in Denmark, Grignon and Versailles in France, Ultuna in Sweden and Rothamsted in the United Kingdom) to compare the dynamics of PyOC and soil organic carbon (SOC) in the same plots at the decadal time scale (from 25 to 80 years of <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> depending on the site). <b>Bare</b> <b>fallow</b> plots were regularly sampled throughout the <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> duration and these samples were carefully archived. In <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> plots, with negligible external carbon input and with continuing biodegradation, SOC is depleting. Using the Benzene Polycarboxylic Acid (BPCA) technique to estimate the PyOC quantity and quality in the soils at different sampling dates, we investigated if PyOC content was also decreasing and compared the rates of depletion of PyOC and SOC. We found that PyOC contents decreased rapidly in soils at all sites. The loss of PyOC between the first and the last soil sampling ranged from 19. 8 to 57. 3 % of the initial PyOC content. Furthermore, PyOC quality exhibited a similar evolution at all sites, becoming more enriched in condensed material with time. We applied a one pool model with mono-exponential decay to our data and found an average mean residence time of native PyOC of 116 years across the different sites, {{with a standard deviation of}} 15 years, just 1. 6 times longer than that of SOC. Our results show that, though having a longer residence time than total SOC, PyOC content can decrease rapidly in soils suggesting that the potential for long-term C storage in soil by PyOC amendments is less than currently anticipated.

Higher (P ≤ 0. 05) levels of P. penetrans occurred in the rye and vetch plots than in fallowed plots. No influence of P. penetrans on peanut, rye, or vetch yield was observed in 1987 and 1988, but in 1989 peanut yield was 64 % higher (P ≤ 0. 05) in plots infested with P. penetrans than in plots without P. penetrans.

40|$|International audienceDespite its {{relevance}} to long term carbon sequestration in soils, {{there is to}} date no successful experimental way to isolate all the stable pool of soil organic carbon (SOC), i. e. SOC that has a residence time of centuries to millennia. Long term <b>bare</b> <b>fallows</b> (LTBF) offer {{a unique opportunity to}} study stable SOC, as without carbon inputs and with continuing biodegradation and mineralization, SOC becomes progressively enriched in its most stable components. Here, we took advantage of the 42 plots LTBF experiment of Versailles (France), where C inputs stopped 80 years ago, to test the relevance of chemical oxidation methods to isolate a pool of carbon stable at the centennial timescale. To do so, we studied the effect of two oxidizing reagents -hydrogen peroxide, H 2 O 2, and sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl on soil total organic carbon (TOC) content after 0 and 79 years of LTBF. If these methods can isolate centennial stable C, then chemical oxidation resistant-C from 0 and 79 years of LTBF should equate, in amount, with TOC after 79 years of LTBF. Results showed that chemical oxidation strongly decreased TOC in both soils. Oxidation-resistant OC accounted for ca. 1 mgC g(- 1) soil, which is five times smaller than TOC in the untreated LTBF 79 soils, after 79 years of biological oxidation. Moreover, the amount of oxidation-resistant OC was significantly lower in LTBF 79 compared to LTBF 0. We conclude that neither centennial stable carbon nor older stable carbon can be successfully quantified by these chemical oxidation methods...|$|R

Isolating experimentally the stable soil carbon from other, more vulnerable, pools is of prime importance for calibrating soil C models, and gaining insights on the mechanisms leading to soil organic carbon (SOC) stability. Long-term <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> experiments, in which the decay of SOC is monitored for decades after inputs from plant material have stopped, represent a unique opportunity to assess the stable organic carbon. We synthesized data from 6 <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> experiments of long-duration, covering a range of soil types and climate conditions, at Askov (Denmark), Grignon and Versailles (France), Kursk (Russia), Rothamsted (UK), and Ultuna (Sweden). The conceptual model of SOC being divided into three pools with increasing turnover times, a labile pool (~ years), an intermediate pool (~ decades) and a stable pool (~ several centuries or more) fits well with the long term SOC decays observed in <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> soils. The modeled stable pool estimates ranged from 2. 7 gC kg− 1 at Rothamsted to 6. 8 gC kg− 1 at Grignon. The uncertainty over the identification of the stable pool is large due to the short length of the fallow records relative to the time scales involved in the decay of soil C. At Versailles, where there is least uncertainty associated with the determination of a stable pool, the soil contains predominantly stable C after 80 years of continuous <b>bare</b> <b>fallow.</b> Such a site represents a unique research platform for future experimentation addressing the characteristics of stable SOC and its vulnerability to global change...|$|E

Better understanding the mechanisms responsible for the pluri-decadal persistence of carbon in soils requires constraining the dynamics, the distribution and the chemical nature of both SOM and associated mineral phases. Benefiting from the unique opportunity offered by a long-term <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> (LTBF) experiment having started in 1928 in Versailles (France), we report C and N decline with time for six different particle-size fractions (sand [> 50 μm], coarse silt [20 - 50 μm], fine silt [2 - 20 μm], coarse clays [0. 2 - 2 μm], intermediate clays [0. 05 - 0. 2 μm] and fine clays [0 - 0. 05 μm]). We also report spatially resolved characterization at the submicrometer scale of SOC dynamics using STXM-based NEXAFS and nano-SIMS. As expected, total C and N declined with time in all fractions. The lowest declines were observed for intermediate size clays [0. 05 - 0. 2 μm] in which only 53 % of C and 63 % of N were lost between the initiation of the <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> and 2008. C/N ratios of SOM associated to clays significantly decreased with time whereas C/N ratios of SOM associated to silt fractions remained constant. SOM associated to intermediate and fine clays were notably very low (below 5) after 8 decades of <b>bare</b> <b>fallow.</b> Bulk-scale C-NEXAFS data reveals that the speciation of SOC remained almost constant with LTBF duration. STXM-based NEXAFS investigations at the submicrometer scale revealed that all smectitic clays were associated to OM coatings at all dates whereas illite particles became progressively SOMfree with increasing <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> duration. STXM-based NEXAFS investigations also revealed that particles of organic matter can be observed within the coarse clay fractions even after 8 decades of <b>bare</b> <b>fallow.</b> Nano-SIMS investigations on bulk clay fractions showed that OM decline was similar for Si-, Al- and Fe-rich regions.

Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we investigated the impact of two legume break crops, peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and soybean (Glycine max), on the nitrifying communities in a sugarcane cropping soil. Cropping with either legume substantially increased abundances of soil bacteria and archaea and altered the microbial community composition, but did not significantly alter species richness and evenness relative to a <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> treatment. The ammonia oxidisers were mostly archaeal rather than bacterial, and were 24 - 44 % less abundant in the legume cropping soils compared to the <b>bare</b> <b>fallow.</b> Furthermore, abundances of the archaeal amoA gene encoding ammonia monooxygenase in the soybean and peanut cropping soils were only 30 - 35 % of that in the <b>bare</b> <b>fallow.</b> These results warrant further investigation into the mechanisms driving responses of ammonia oxidising communities and their nitrification capacity in soil during legume cropping...|$|E

Fallow tillage treatments consisting of <b>bare</b> <b>fallow,</b> stubble-mulch and no-till were established on the trial plots. <b>Bare</b> <b>fallow,</b> stubble-mulch, and no-till tillage treatments had no significant effect on nitrate-nitrogen accumulation. However, the fact that nitrate-nitrogen accumulated {{at the end of}} fallow was several times higher than {{in the beginning of the}} fallow has great importance in terms of fertilizer application. Adequate moisture and temperature favored nitrate-nitrogen accumulation in the tillage plots during the fallow. The 0 - 10 cm soil layer appeared to be the accumulation zone in the three tillage systems. Effects of tillage treatments on soil structure were investigated through evaluation of aggregate size distribution and water stability. In the 0 - 10 cm soil layer, the aggregates larger than 0. 84 mm, considered to be a good indicator of soil resistance to wind erosion, were more prevalent in <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> than in the other two treatments.

The estimate of stable C ranged from 2. 7 g C kg− 1 at Rothamsted to 6. 8 g C kg− 1 at Grignon.

40|$|Water {{shortages}} in many rice-growing regions, combined with growing global imperatives to increase food production, are driving research into increased water use efficiency and modified agricultural practices in rice-based cropping systems. Well-tested cropping systems models that capture interactions between soil water and nutrient dynamics, crop growth, climate and management {{can assist in}} the evaluation of new agricultural practices. The APSIM model was designed to simulate diverse crop sequences, residue/tillage practices and specification of field management options. It was previously unable to simulate processes associated with the long-term flooded or saturated soil conditions encountered in rice-based systems, due to its heritage in dryland cropping applications. To address this shortcoming, the rice crop components of the ORYZA 2000 rice model were incorporated and modifications were made to the APSIM soil water and nutrient modules to include descriptions of soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics under anaerobic conditions. We established a process for simulating the two-way transition between anaerobic and aerobic soil conditions occurring in crop sequences of flooded rice and other nonflooded crops, pastures and fallows. These transitions are dynamically simulated and driven by modelled hydraulic variables (soil water and floodwater depth). Descriptions of floodwater biological and chemical processes were also added. Our assumptions included a simplified approach to modelling O- 2 transport processes in saturated soils. The improved APSIM model was tested against diverse, replicated experimental datasets for rice-based cropping systems, representing a spectrum of geographical locations (Australia, Indonesia and Philippines), soil types, management practices, crop species, varieties and sequences. The model performed equally well in simulating rice grain yield during multi-season crop sequences as the original validation testing reported for the stand-alone ORYZA 2000 model simulating single crops (n = 121, R- 2 = 0. 81 with low bias (slope, alpha = 1. 02, intercept, beta = - 323 kg ha(- 1)), RMSE = 1061 kg ha(- 1) (cf. SD of measured data = 2160 kg ha(- 1))). This suggests robustness in APSIM's simulation of the rice-growing environment and provides evidence on the usefulness of our modifications and practicality of our assumptions. Aspects of particular strength were identified (crop rotations; response to applied fertilizers; the performance of <b>bare</b> <b>fallows),</b> together with areas for further development work (simulation of retained crop stubble during fallows, greenhouse gas emissions). APSIM is now suitable to investigate production responses of potential agronomic and management changes in rice-based cropping systems, particularly in response to future imperatives linked to resource availability, climate change, and food security. Further testing is required to evaluate the impact of our simplified assumptions on the model's simulation of greenhouse gas emissions in rice-based cropping systems.

40|$|Three {{contrasting}} rotation breaks (sown pasture, alternate {{crops and}} <b>bare</b> <b>fallow)</b> were established at five sites in Queensland, Australia, on land {{that had been}} under sugarcane monoculture for at least 20 years. The breaks were in place for 30 – 42 months at four sites and for 12 months at the fifth site. The effects of the breaks on selected soil biological properties were assessed following {{the removal of the}} breaks and before the area was re-planted with sugarcane. At the four sites with the long-term breaks, microbial biomass increased under the pasture break, declined under the <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> break and did not change significantly under the crop break, compared to microbial biomass under continual sugarcane. At these sites, populations of the root lesion nematode (Pratylenchus zeae) declined under all three breaks whereas populations of free-living nematodes increased under the pasture and crop breaks but declined under the <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> break. At the site with the 12 month breaks, a forage legume pasture increased microbial biomass, reduced lesion nematodes and together with the crop break increased populations of free-living nematodes. At the four sites with the long-term breaks there was an increase in the ratio of fungal:bacterial fatty acids and an increase in fatty acid 16 : 1 ω 5 c (used as a biomarker for mycorrhizal fungi) under the pasture and crop breaks. Also at these sites, the soil microbial community under the pasture, crop and <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> breaks, respectively, showed increased, no change or diminished capacity to utilize carbon substrates compared to the soil microbial community under continual sugarcane. The yield of the sugarcane crop following all three breaks was significantly higher than the yield of the crop following continual sugarcane at each of the sites with the long-term breaks. Examination of the longevity of the effect of the rotation breaks on soil biological properties at the sites with the long-term breaks, suggested that effects on some soil organisms (e. g. lesion nematodes) maybe short-lived...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Despite the {{importance}} of carbon (C) pools and CO 2 fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems and especially in soils, {{as well as many}} attempts to assign fluxes to specific pools, this challenge remains unsolved. Interestingly, scientists in-vestigating pools are not closely linked with scientists study-ing fluxes. This review therefore focused on experimental approaches enabling soil C pools to be linked with CO 2 flux from the soil. The background, advantages and shortcomings of uncoupled approaches (measuring only pools or fluxes) and of coupled approaches (measuring both pools and fluxes) were evaluated and their prerequisites – steady state of pools and isotopic steady state – described. The uncoupled ap-proaches include: (i) monitoring the decrease of C pools in long-term <b>fallow</b> <b>bare</b> soil lacking C input over decades, (ii) analyzing components of CO 2 efflux dynamics by incu...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the SMOS mission is to deliver global fields of sea surface {{salinity}} and surface soil moisture using L-band (1. 4 GHz) radiometry. Within {{the context of the}} preparation of SMOS activities over land, a field campaign, SMOSREX (Surface Monitoring Of the Soil Reservoir EXperiment), has been in operation since January 2001 in Mauzac, near Toulouse in France. Continuous ground measurements of meteorological variables, soil moisture and temperature profiles have been taken over bare soil and a grass plot left fallow. Since January 2003, SMOSREX has been providing accurate field measurements of dual polarized L-band brightness temperature up-welling from both <b>bare</b> soil and <b>fallow</b> plots, together with multi-spectral (from visible to infrared frequencies) remote sensing surface data. The scientific objectives are presented in this paper and the corresponding experimental design is described. The experimental concept is totally new since (i) SMOSREX combines land–surface–atmosphere observations, passive microwave measurements and VIS to NIR remote sensing, (ii) SMOSREX is based on highly accurate L-band measurements carried out by a radiometer specifically designed for the experiment, and (iii) SMOSREX provides a unique continuous data set of L-band measurements over several years. The characteristics of the L-band emission are presented at diurnal, seasonal and annual temporal scales, and the emissions are compared over bare soil and natural grass. The surface emissions over <b>bare</b> soil and <b>fallow</b> area are shown to be counter-phased at the diurnal scale due to small variations in vegetation water content and bare soil surface moisture. Innovative long term results using L-band measurements for both bare soil and natural grass are presented in this paper, and the relationship between the surface emission at L-band and surface bare soil moisture is shown to be suitable for a long term period (19 months).

Soil aggregate stability and the distribution of organic carbon and nitrogen in different aggregate fractions would be affected by different plant communities. The objectives of this study were to elucidate the effects of different plant communities on soil aggregate stability and the distribution of organic carbon and nitrogen in different aggregate fractions in order to prove that the different plant covers enhance soil aggregate stability. Six kinds of soil samples under forest (Quercus liaotungensis, Populus davidiana, Pinus tabulaeformis, Bothriochloa, a 14 year abandoned land, and a 19 year <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> soil. Four kinds of soil samples under shrub land (the 24 year old Caragana Korshinskii Kom.; the 14 year old C Korshinskii Kom., 3 year old abandoned grazing land and traditional slope cropland which is claimed by the farmers for production with very low fertilizers) were collected from the hilly-gully area on the Loess Plateau, which was divided into 0 - 10 cm and 10 - 20 cm. We investigated soil aggregate stability and soil aggregate fractions by ultrasonic fractionation (USAS), and the distribution of organic carbon and nitrogen in different fractions under forest and afforested land, as key indicators for soil remediation through revegetation. The results showed that soil organic carbon (Corg) and total nitrogen (Nt) were strongly increased under forest and artificial shrub land compared to cropland and <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> land and were higher in the surface layers (0 - 10 cm) than in the subsurface (10 - 20 cm). Soil aggregate stability (SAS) was quite low under <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> land and cropping land soils, in comparison with the 4 forest communities. The three main fractions of soil aggregates, obtained by ultrasonic fractionation, were 630 - 250 mu m had a higher Corg content than micro-aggregates, 250 - 100 mu m > 100 - 63 mu m >> 63 mu m. In comparison to cropland and <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> land, forest and artificial shrub can protect and enhance the Corg, Nt and soil aggregate stability. The higher C:N ratio of macro-aggregate fractions indicates a rapid turnover of soil organic carbon in the top soil of forest sites and even on <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> and crop land. The narrow range of C:N ratio in micro-aggregates indicates that soil organic carbon in micro-aggregates is more stable than that in the macro-aggregates. We concluded that revegetation of eroded soils accelerates soil remediation and rehabilitation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} to use historical data to test physically based runoff and soil erosion prediction models {{as well as the}} method to estimate model parameters. WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project) was validated for <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> and annual wheat treatments at Gunnedah, New South Wales, Australia. Wheat stubble was either burned or mulched. Climate, soil, management, and runoff and soil loss data were collected for the period 1980 - 87 for 3 <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> plots, and 1950 - 74 for 10 annual wheat plots. Three slope lengths from 21 to 62 m were established for the treatment with stubble burned. Slope steepness varied from 8 % to 9 % at the site. Effective saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil erodibility parameters were estimated from measured soil properties. No further calibration of these parameters was attempted in order to assess the true potential of the model for runoff and soil loss predictions. WEPP worked well for the <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> plots with prediction efficiency of 0. 97 for event runoff and soil losses. WEPP generally over-predicted the runoff, and consequently, the soil loss for annual wheat treatments for the site. WEPP was able to predict the effect of slope length on sediment concentration and soil loss for the site. CLIGEN, which provides the continuous climate input to WEPP, was found to produce adequately the mean daily rainfall, but produced higher than expected peak rainfall intensity, resulting in higher runoff and soil loss for all treatments.

40|$|Perennial weeds are an {{increasing}} problem in Finland, particularly in organic farming. Mechanical control by hoeing, stubble cultivation and bare fallowing provides some options for managing these weeds. Mechanical control of perennial weeds in barley and oats was studied {{in a field}} experiment with five replicates, placed in a clay soil (containing 6 12 % organic matter) field under organic production. The field was heavily infested with Sonchus arvensis and moderately infested with Cirsium arvense, Elymus repens and Stachys palustris. The treatments were (2001 2002) barley oats, barley oats with inter-row hoeing, and <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> oats, and additionally stubble cultivation (yes/no) across these treatments. The experiment was analyzed as a strip-plot design with stubble cultivation as a horizontal factor and treatment as a vertical factor. Weed number and dry mass were assessed prior to crop harvest from two 0. 5 m × 0. 5 m quadrats per plot. Both stubble cultivation in previous autumn and inter-row hoeing reduced significantly S. arvensis biomass in oats, but bare fallowing was the most effective treatment. Bare fallowing also controlled E. repens and S. palustris, but was not effective against C. arvense. Oat yields were slightly higher after <b>bare</b> <b>fallow</b> and slightly lower in hoeing treatment compared to ordinary oatsafter- barley crop stand, but the differences were not statistically significant. The results suggest that S. arvensis could be reduced by stubble cultivation in previous autumn, and could even be controlled by inter-row hoeing in oat stands. <b>Bare</b> <b>fallow</b> is {{an effective way to}} reduce most perennial weeds. When tackling perennial weeds in oat production, appropriate options for a given field and rotation should be chosen according to dominant weed species. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. In cold regions, {{frozen soil}} has a {{significant}} influence on runoff and water erosion. In the U. S. Inland Pacific Northwest, major erosion events typically occur during winter as frozen soil thaws and exhibits low cohesion. Previous applications of the WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project) model to a continuous <b>bare</b> tilled <b>fallow</b> (CBF) runoff plot at the Palouse Conservation Field Station (PCFS) in southeastern Washington State showed that WEPP reproduced the occurrence of the large erosion events, but the amount of sediment yield was either under- or overestimated. The inability of WEPP to reproduce the magnitude of field-observed erosion events at the PCFS suggests {{the need for an}} examination of the dynamic changes in soil erosion properties and for improving the representation of such dynamics. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the seasonal changes of rill erosion parameters for two CBF runoff plots at the PCFS. Field-observed runoff and erosion events during 1984 - 1990 were used to estimate WEPP hydraulic and erosion parameters, including soil effective hydraulic conductivity, critical shear stress (τc), and rill erodibility (Kr). The parameters for each event were best-fitted using WEPP single-event simulations to reproduce the observed runoff and sediment yield on both plots. The results suggest that the adjustment factors for τc and Kr of frozen and thawing soils in the WEPP model could be modified to better describe the changes of these parameters in winter...|$|R
40|$|Organic matter (SOM) {{is a key}} {{constituent}} of soil {{as it is a}} “revolving nutrient fund” {{and improves}} soil structure, maintains crop production and minimizes erosion. In semiarid environments, the major problem for sustainable farming systems is the continuous decline of SOM towards levels too low for agricultural purposes. Furthermore, SOM is per se a dynamic entity. Its quantity and quality depend on numerous factors including climate, vegetation type, nutrient availability, disturbance, land use and management practices. In particular, soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in Mediterranean semiarid agrosystems are constrained by 1) limited C inputs because of low precipitation and high evapotranspiration rates, 2) secular agriculture under intensive tillage systems combined with long <b>bare</b> <b>fallows,</b> and 3) the removal of crop residues for animal feed. Enhancing SOC content may be achieved by avoiding those techniques that speed up mineralization process or by increasing residue inputs, or both. A reduction in tillage intensity has been widely recognized as a successful strategy to reduce SOC losses. Conventional tillage (CT) systems is supposed to accelerate SOM mineralisation and consequently increase CO 2 flux from soil to the atmosphere. Ploughing favours residue mixing throughout soil, thus improving not only physical contact between soil microorganisms and crop residues but also soil microclimatic conditions for crop residue decomposition (e. g., higher soil moisture content, oxygenation and temperature). In contrast, no tillage systems (NT) reduce microbial activity and, therefore, SOM decomposition. The higher soil bulk density expected under NT, associated with reductions in soil porosity, may lead to a more limited O 2 supply for heterotrophic decomposition. However, although many studies suggest that NT increases SOC within the soil profile compared to CT, other studies indicate no net change in SOC. The latter studies suggest that NT only stratifies the SOC, as a near-surface increase in SOC was offset by a concomitant decrease in the subsurface. Organic manuring and inorganic fertilization are the most common practices applied in agricultural management to improve soil quality and crop productivity, respectively. Organic amendments and inorganic fertilizers, above all when coupled together, may indirectly influence soil C inputs through the returned crop residues and rhizodepositions, while directly controlling C outputs via soil microbial activity. In particular green manuring, by introducing into the soil fresh organic matter with a low C/N ratio, enhance SOM content and quality, thus sustaining a high potential microbial activity and biomass. Under Mediterranean climate, both high compost inputs and reduced tillage may have beneficial effects on soil microflora activities and nutrient availability. Reversing CT to sustainable agriculture usually decreases soil bulk density, enhances SOM as favours the immobilisation of C and N and increases most soil microbial quality indicators. Despite all the benefits listed above, soil C sequestration, through conversion to a restorative land use and adoption of recommended management practices, is more intense in cooler and wetter than warmer and drier climates. In this chapter we review in detail 1) the effects of the most widespread agricultural management practices on SOM dynamics, either quantitatively and qualitatively, and 2) their potential role and reliability to preserve SOM in semiarid Mediterranean environment...|$|R
