2500|$|British Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home made a gaffe in February 1964: his speechwriters, {{trying to}} make him appear in touch with popular culture, wrote him the line, [...] "I'm too modest to claim the country loves us, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> can't be bad." [...] However, he {{appeared}} not to understand the reference, and actually said, [...] "but you know, err, that can't be too bad." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ahmadinejad {{gave the}} {{examples}} of Iran under the Shah, the Soviet Union and Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq as examples of apparently invincible regimes that ceased to exist, using them to justify his belief that the United States and the State of Israel can also be defeated: [...] "They say {{it is not possible}} to have a world without the United States and Zionism. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> this is a possible goal and slogan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Puller {{was known}} for his {{constant}} actions to improve the working conditions of enlisted Marines. Puller insisted upon good equipment and discipline; once he came upon a second lieutenant who had ordered an enlisted man to salute him 100 times for missing a salute. Puller told the lieutenant, [...] "You were absolutely correct in making him salute you 100 times, lieutenant, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> an officer must return every salute he receives. Now return them all, and I will keep count." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou art welcome, as {{flowers in}} May, morning or evening; <b>but</b> <b>thee</b> <b>knowest</b> <b>that,</b> girl. As for Mr. Comfort,--it's cold comfort he is, I always say. It's little I {{think of what}} clergymen says, unless it {{be out of the}} pulpit or the like of that. What does they know about lads and lasses?" ...|$|R
60|$|ENID. [With a smile.] I {{go as far}} as most people, Annie, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> yourself, <b>that's</b> nonsense.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{something}} in her manner, however--or in the effect, at least, of this supreme demonstration that had fairly, and by a single touch, lifted him to her side; so that, after she had turned her back to regain the landing and the staircase, he overtook her, before {{she had begun to}} mount, with the ring of excited perception. [...] "Ah, <b>but,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that's</b> rather jolly!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Steve Molks, who interviewed them, said, [...] "Speaking {{with them}} you learn very quickly that they aren't just 'presenters' who turn up for filming and that's it; they're gamers of note {{in their own}} right and spend hours playing to review games {{thoroughly}} and log footage for the show, as well as editing and pre-recording for the show". Invalid Channel said [...] "you can really tell that they've taken all of the footage themselves, it's not one-sided stock footage from the developing company. The hosts really play the games themselves and it shows, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you're getting a real opinion from someone who played the game and know exactly how it handles and how annoying all those bugs are, not two people reading straight from some sort of rigid script." [...] He adds that [...] "being on a non-commercial network helps too" [...] as if the show was on a commercial network it may be more successful, but its credibility would be lost as [...] "once the game companies start paying sponsorship, you'd be seeing a lot of 10/10's {{and a whole lot of}} kiss-ass".|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Hugh said, [...] "that is understood; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{alone or}} before others, I shall always be your {{faithful}} servant." ...|$|E
60|$|L. (aside, to EGYPT). All right; don't be afraid. (Aloud to DORA.) Yes, doubtless; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{is only a}} slow way of UNdressing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>knew</b> <b>that,</b> M. Chauvelin.... <b>But</b> do <b>YOU</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I {{have the}} {{intention}} of killing you now... as you stand... like a dog!..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good. Well, he is {{a little}} wild man, is he not, nearer to the apes from whose race our bodies come? <b>But</b> do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> Allan?" ...|$|R
60|$|VIOLET. Of {{course it}} is very scandalous; <b>but</b> surely <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the Government will sooner or later {{put a stop to}} all these Socialistic attacks on property.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, Mr. Pettigrew, I {{will come}} up any time that you write to me, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I have very strong {{opinions}} about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] he said, [...] "it {{depends upon}} {{how much they}} want to keep you apart. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you are running great risks?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true enough, Wulf, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{among us}} {{it is said}} that Earl Harold is always most careful for the comfort of his soldiers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{one can be}} {{more willing}} to do this than myself, my dear Op, and I am willing to be Hugh again. <b>But,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> all <b>that</b> has passed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's obvious; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that's</b> not {{the part}} that {{interests}} me most, whether it's true or not, and what it all means; {{the part that}} interests me is that such things should happen to such people. I wonder what there is in that commonplace little man to arouse such a passion in that lovely creature. As I watched her, asleep there, while {{he was telling the}} story I had some fantastic idea about the power of love being able to work miracles." ...|$|R
5000|$|Thorogood {{has been}} a {{baseball}} fan {{for most of his}} life, as well as playing semi-pro baseball as a second baseman during the 1970s (drummer Jeff Simon played center field on the same team). He took his daughter to Chicago for her first major league game (Cubs vs. Rockies), during which he sang [...] "Take Me Out to the Ball Game". In a 2011 Guitar World interview, he stated [...] "I'm a Mets fan. There aren't many of us, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that's</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{all very}} pretty Lady Scudamore, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> we young Ladies who are Heiresses must not throw {{ourselves}} away upon Men who have no fortune at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{doubt you}} would, Sally; {{and he might}} like you all the better for it. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> sort of thing isn't my way. People must act in character." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What can you do, after Sam {{here has}} failed?" [...] {{questioned}} James Morris. [...] "I {{know you are}} keen on the trail, White Buffalo, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Sam is too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] says he, [...] "I am {{glad for}} his sake to hear <b>you</b> talk so; <b>but</b> do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> a Turkey {{merchant}} {{will not take}} him under £400 or £500?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Much obliged, I am sure," [...] replied his friend; [...] "I think <b>you</b> mean well, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> should <b>know</b> <b>that</b> my {{appetite}} {{is not so}} depraved as to relish dog." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "D----n them! I'll have 'em before I've done. <b>But</b> don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Macdermot, Reynolds, and {{the other}} fellow agreed {{to put an end}} to Ussher? Why you told me so twenty times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But what am I to do? That idea {{of yours}} of walking {{out to the}} next church and getting {{ourselves}} married sounds very nice and independent, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it is not practicable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{you saved}} {{eight or ten}} {{thousand}} men to France at Oudenarde, and you lost {{a hand in the}} service of the country. That would count for a great deal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your friend, little Moore, [...] You have dirtied before, [...] <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{in safety}} you write: [...] You've {{declared}} in your lines, [...] That revenge he declines, [...] For the poor little man will not fight.|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{very well}} <b>that</b> that isn't {{the only thing}} against you.|$|R
6000|$|Benz. 'Tis true, by Ozmyn's sword {{my brother}} fell; But 'twas a death he merited too well. I know a sister should excuse his fault; <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> too, <b>that</b> Ozmyn's death he sought, ...|$|R
60|$|You {{hear the}} roar of the thunder, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> surely <b>that</b> it is not the thunder itself; that it is only its echo rolling on from cloud to cloud and hill from hill.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dick, you're a marvel! I'm glad {{adversity}} hasn't soured you; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you won't {{make enough}} to keep you in neckties at any business you take up. It's ludicrous to think of your running about with paint samples!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, my good fellow," [...] cried Edgar, {{unable to}} {{restrain}} {{a fit of}} laughter, [...] "I {{do not wish to}} deny the good looks of Mrs Baldwin, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> she's uncommonly ruddy and fat and heavy, as well as fair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} don't, Duncan, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> {{though most of}} them are good, trusty men, some are mean fellows, who would not {{hesitate}} to shoot you in the smoke and confusion of the hunt. Do give up the idea, for my sake, dear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it was; <b>but</b> did <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{the party}} was Lord Cumberland and his family? The guide told me afterward. I never guessed they were anybody, in such plain tweed gowns and thick boots; did you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In the past, the baths {{served as}} {{community}} spaces for gay men. Even now, some men {{choose to go}} to the baths with their friends (even though they may not necessarily have sex with each other). While many men talk to each other at the baths, even forming long-lasting friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, anonymity. But I’ve been to a sauna recently in New Zealand, where everyone just chatted away, which I found very strange. Um, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that's</b> because I guess it was a smaller city and people generally knew each other. [...] "S Alfred" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dearest Sisters,--You are {{thinking}} of me to-day, I <b>know,</b> <b>but</b> <b>you</b> hardly <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{in an hour or}} two I hope the Primate will ride down and baptize nine of our Melanesian scholars.|$|R
