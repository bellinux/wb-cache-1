2500|$|Aguirre {{represents}} Darcy Flynn, an SEC {{lawyer who}} {{also became a}} whistleblower after Robert Khuzami asked his staff in an e-mail on May 18, 2011 to report any questionable behavior {{on the part of}} lawyers representing clients. Though Khuzami had meant lawyers outside the SEC, Flynn reported activity that had taken place within the SEC. Early in Flynn's 13-year career at the SEC, he worked on a case where investigators thought they had clear evidence of fraud against Deutsche Bank. In an interview with Der Spiegel, CEO Rolf Breuer had denied the bank was involved in talks to acquire Bankers Trust, causing Bankers Trust stock to drop, which could lower the cost of a merger. SEC investigators began looking into the matter, collecting sworn testimony and documents that proved Breuer had lied. Deutsche Bank hired former SEC enforcement director Gary Lynch to persuade the SEC not to pursue the case, which had to be approved by superiors before proceeding. Approval to go forward with the case was approved by every level and lacked only the signature of Richard H. Walker, then serving as SEC enforcement director. Rather than approve the case, on July 10, 2001 he recused himself. On July 23, 2001, a letter was sent to Deutsche Bank informing them, [...] ""Inquiry in the above-captioned matter has been terminated." [...] The SEC dropped the fraud investigation without the customary explanation of its decision to close the case. On October 1, 2001, Walker was hired as general counsel by Deutsche Bank. In 2004, he hired Khuzami to work at the bank and a few years later, recommended him to become SEC enforcement director. Flynn was interviewed by staff from three congressional committees in summer 2011 on the Deutsche <b>Bank</b> <b>case</b> and the destruction of files from thousands of preliminary investigation cases conducted by the SEC. Senator Grassley wrote [...] a letter to the SEC about the document destruction and SEC inspector general H. David Kotz investigated the matter.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} value {{creation}} in relationship banking from the relationship managers' perspective. A grounded theory approach (Strauss and Corbin, 1998) is adopted that theory {{is derived from}} data, systematically gathered and analyzed throughout the research process. This study derives concepts and categories from primary data and identifies relationships among these theoretical elements. This study provides a comprehensive picture of relationship banking as a social phenomenon, and supplies some theoretical and managerial implications. Moreover, this study links the literature relevant to relationship banking from different disciplines. This is {{a new way of}} looking at the relationship banking phenomenon and relevant literature in an integrated manner. This study conducted research to investigate why the <b>case</b> <b>banks</b> establish long-term relationships with corporate customers? The <b>case</b> <b>banks</b> considered macro conditions including the advances in technology, financial deregulation, and business globalisation when they adopted relationship banking. The interviewees perceived that relationship banking was efficient for managing risk, effective for saving cost and necessary for cross-selling. Some intervening conditions including customer information and knowledge, customer needs and customer confidence also influence the development of relationship banking. This study investigated how the <b>case</b> <b>banks</b> establish and maintain these relationships and how they organise and motivate relationship managers? The <b>case</b> <b>banks</b> built a relationship orientated corporate culture, organised employees around customer relationships and employed customervalue based performance measurement and incentive-based reward system. The employees cooperated inside the organisation and communicated with their customers regularly, exchanged information and provided relationship transactions. This study also investigated how the <b>case</b> <b>banks</b> and corporate customers get benefits from relationship banking? The interviewees perceived that the corporate customers gained benefits including fund availability, product availability, service quality, in-time heir, and business platform. The <b>case</b> <b>banks</b> gained benefits including reduction of credit risk, increase in income, sustainable profit, customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction. The findings were integrated and linked to some banking, finance, organisation and marketing literature related to relationship <b>banking</b> phenomenon. The <b>case</b> <b>banks</b> increased internal service quality through employee relationship management and improved employee satisfaction. The interviewees perceived that the corporate customers received benefits in the corporate banking market by customer relationship management. The increased customer satisfaction resulted in customer retention and profit to the <b>case</b> <b>banks.</b> The <b>case</b> <b>banks</b> perceived that added shareholder wealth improved shareholder satisfaction. This study concluded that the <b>case</b> <b>banks,</b> which had more relationship banking competitive advantages and better relationship banking, related processing systems were expected to outperform the competing banks...|$|R

40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 21 SEP 2015 How does one explain {{the variation in}} the EU's success in enacting and enforcing policies {{that lead to the}} supply of regional or global public goods? We examine how the EU deploys its positional resources to enact laws that compel governments or firms to contribute to the provision of public goods. We suggest that leaders such as the EU are able to compel public goods contributions if they have the legal authority to do so, and are able to deploy their positional resources to build effective coalitions or reduce the leverage of potential veto players. We look at two issue areas empirically: banking and the environment. In the <b>banking</b> <b>cases,</b> the EU sought to provide regional public goods; in the environmental cases, it sought to provide regional and global public goods. We examine instances of leadership success as well as failure. In the <b>banking</b> <b>cases,</b> we examine Outright Monetary Transactions (success) and banking single resolution mechanism (less successful); the environmental cases pertain to chemical regulation (success) and airline emissions (failure). These cases reveal the EU's skill and limitations in deploying its positional authority to induce contributions for public goods provision from EU member governments, EU firms and nonEU firms...|$|R
