5|$|By the 1850s, {{with the}} era of the romantic <b>ballet</b> at an end, the {{principal}} personalities of the <b>ballet,</b> such as Perrot, Saint-Léon, Taglioni, and the composer Pugni, joined the Tsar's Imperial <b>Ballet</b> of St. Petersburg, Russia. <b>Ballet</b> in London went through a considerable decline beginning with the fire at Her Majesty's Theatre, a decline that lasted {{until the end of the}} 19th century. <b>Ballet</b> in London was not resurrected until the early 20th century, when such dancers as Adeline Genée began performing. The theatre's <b>ballet</b> company found a new home at the Old Vic and soon took on the name of the Vic-Wells <b>Ballet.</b> Later, moving primarily to the Sadler's Wells Theatre, the company became known as the Sadler's Wells <b>Ballet.</b> Eventually the troupe began performing at the Royal Opera House and became the Royal <b>Ballet,</b> as it is known today.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1830s {{until the late}} 1840s Her Majesty's Theatre played host to {{the heyday of the}} era of the romantic <b>ballet,</b> and the theatre's {{resident}} <b>ballet</b> company was considered the most renowned in Europe, aside from the <b>Ballet</b> du Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique in Paris. The celebrated <b>ballet</b> master Jules Perrot began staging <b>ballet</b> at Her Majesty's in 1830. Lumley appointed him Premier Maître de <b>Ballet</b> (chief choreographer) to the theatre in 1842. Among the works of <b>ballet</b> that he staged were Ondine, ou La Naïade (1843), La Esmeralda (1844), and Catarina, ou La Fille du Bandit (1846), as well as the celebrated divertissement Pas de Quatre (1845). Other <b>ballet</b> masters created works for the <b>ballet</b> of Her Majesty's Theatre throughout the period of the romantic <b>ballet,</b> most notably Paul Taglioni (son of Filippo Taglioni), who staged ballets including Coralia, ou Le Chevalier inconstant (1847) and Electra (1849, the first production of a <b>ballet</b> to make use of electric lighting). Arthur Saint-Léon staged such works as La Vivandière (1844), Le Violin du Diable (1849), and Le Jugement de Pâris (1850), which was considered a sequel of sorts to Pas de Quatre.|$|E
5|$|Sir Kenneth MacMillan (11 December 192929 October 1992) was a British <b>ballet</b> {{dancer and}} {{choreographer}} who was {{artistic director of}} the Royal <b>Ballet</b> in London between 1970 and 1977, and its principal choreographer from 1977 until his death. Earlier he had served as director of <b>ballet</b> for the Deutsche Oper in Berlin. He was also associate director of the American <b>Ballet</b> Theatre from 1984 to 1989, and artistic associate of the Houston <b>Ballet</b> from 1989 to 1992.|$|E
50|$|He {{composed}} {{about 40}} <b>ballets</b> and 40 opera <b>ballets.</b> Many of his <b>ballets</b> {{were used by}} the Folk dance movement where they are still performed, such as Daldans, Jössehäradspolska and Vingåkersdans.|$|R

5|$|Two ballets caused great {{excitement}} in Paris in the 1830s. In November 1831, Meyerbeer's opera Robert le diable had its first performance. It featured a short <b>ballet</b> called <b>Ballet</b> of the Nuns. In this little <b>ballet,</b> scantily clad nuns rise from their graves to dance wantonly in the moonlight. The public loved this little supernatural <b>ballet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Van Hamel studied {{classical}} <b>ballet</b> in Denmark, the Netherlands, Indonesia, and Venezuela.

5|$|Although he {{is mainly}} {{associated}} with the Royal <b>Ballet,</b> MacMillan frequently considered himself an outsider there and felt driven {{to work with other}} companies throughout his career as choreographer.

5|$|Born on 16 November 1945 in Brussels, van Hamel was the {{youngest}} of three siblings of Dutch parents. Her father, Diederik (Dick) Alfred van Hamel, was a diplomat stationed in Copenhagen. Her mother, Manette van Hamel (née Cramer), born in 1913 in Deventer, was a music teacher and violinist who played in a string quartet. Martine van Hamel began <b>ballet</b> lessons at the age of four in Copenhagen where it was common for children to study <b>ballet.</b> As a diplomat, her father was routinely stationed in different countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands, and Indonesia. It was difficult for her to find teachers but she took lessons when possible. While her father was stationed in Caracas, Venezuela, van Hamel, then age ten, took classes with Henry Danton from The Royal <b>Ballet.</b> Danton frequently guest taught at the National <b>Ballet</b> of Venezuela. In 1958, she moved to Canada to study at Canada's National <b>Ballet</b> School with Betty Oliphant.|$|E
40|$|Rolf de Maré’s <b>Ballets</b> Suédois {{was active}} from 1920 to 1925. It {{was the chief}} artistic rival to Diaghilev’s <b>Ballets</b> Russes, and de Maré was often {{referred}} to as the Swedish Serge Diaghilev. With Jean Börlin as chief choreographer, the company created twenty-four <b>ballets</b> in collaboration with prominent modern artists and composers, including Fernand Léger, Giorgio de Chirico, Pablo Picasso, Francis Picabia, Erik Satie, Darius Milhaud, and Cole Porter. When first launched, the troupe performed <b>ballets</b> in a style similar to the <b>Ballets</b> Russes, but de Maré’s interest in the visual arts and the vibrancy of modern, contemporary life resulted in a greater emphasis on abstraction and popular idioms in both the design and choreography of <b>Ballets</b> Suédois productions...|$|R

5|$|Copeland {{attended}} the summer workshop at the San Francisco <b>Ballet</b> School in 1998. She and Bradley selected the workshop over offers from the Joffrey <b>Ballet,</b> ABT and Dance Theater of Harlem, among others. Of the programs she auditioned for, only New York City <b>Ballet</b> declined {{to make her}} an offer. San Francisco <b>Ballet,</b> ABT and New York City <b>Ballet</b> are regarded as the three preeminent classical <b>ballet</b> companies in the US. During the six-week workshop at San Francisco, Copeland {{was placed in the}} most advanced classes and was under a full tuition plus expenses scholarship. At the end of the workshop, she received one of the few offers to continue as a full-time student at the school. She declined the offer because of the encouragement from her mother to return home, the prospect of continuing personal training from the Bradley family and dreams of a subsequent summer with ABT.|$|E
5|$|Currently, major Italian opera theaters {{maintain}} <b>ballet</b> companies. They {{exist to}} provide incidental and ceremonial dancing in many operas, such as Aida or La Traviata. These dance companies usually maintain a separate <b>ballet</b> season and perform the standard repertoire of classical <b>ballet,</b> little {{of which is}} Italian. The Italian equivalent of the Russian Bolshoi <b>Ballet</b> and similar companies that exist only to perform <b>ballet,</b> independent of a parent opera theater is La Scala <b>Ballet,</b> which is {{under the direction of}} Frèdèric Olivieri. Since 1979 there has existed in Italy a modern dance company, the Aterballetto, based in Reggio Emilia. The company performs worldwide under the leadership of choreographer Mauro Bigonzetti.|$|E
5|$|Giselle {{was first}} {{performed}} in Russia at the Bolshoi Theatre, St. Petersburg, on 18 December 1842. Stepan Gedeonov, the Director of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, sent his <b>ballet</b> master Antoine Titus to Paris {{to find a}} new <b>ballet</b> for ballerina Yelena Andreyanova. Titus chose Giselle. The <b>Ballet</b> Master then staged the work completely from memory in St. Petersburg. Perrot produced Giselle in St. Petersburg in 1851. He made many changes to the <b>ballet</b> in his years of service to the Imperial <b>Ballet.</b> In the 1880s, Petipa made many changes to the Perrot production.|$|E
50|$|After {{returning}} to Belgium he auditioned for Alain Platel and danced {{in several of}} his productions. He {{became one of the}} choreographers of les <b>ballets</b> C de la B. That collective expanded into an artistic platform for various choreographers: Koen Augustijnen, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, Christine De Smedt, Lisi Estaras, Alain Platel, Fred Toffer and Hans Van den Broeck. For les <b>ballets</b> C de la B he made a series of productions that toured international: How to approach a dog (Hans Van den Broeck / les <b>ballets</b> C de la B, 1992), Everyman (Hans Van den Broeck / les <b>ballets</b> C de la B, 1994), (They Feed, We) Eat, Eat, Eat (Hans Van den Broeck / les <b>ballets</b> C de la B, 1996), Au Progrès (Hans Van den Broeck / les <b>ballets</b> C de la B, 1998), La Sortie (Hans Van den Broeck / les <b>ballets</b> C de la B, 1999), Induced Sleep (Hans Van den Broeck / les <b>ballets</b> C de la B, 2000) and Lac des Singes (Hans Van den Broeck / les <b>ballets</b> C de la B, 2001). In these physical works of ‘dance-theatre’ that are strongly influenced by Jan Fabre's work, the stubbornness in communication and the boundary between reality and fiction are recurring themes. Productions as La sortie (Hans Van den Broeck / les <b>ballets</b> C de la B, 1999) and Lac des Singes (Hans Van den Broeck / les <b>ballets</b> C de la B, 2001) investigate animality and cruelty, psychological aspects that people develop mainly in groups.|$|R
50|$|Since 1996, Mette Edvardsen has {{her home}} base in Brussels, Belgium, where she started {{working as a}} dancer and {{performer}} for the choreographers Hans Van den Broeck (1996-2000) and Christine De Smedt (2000-2005) when they were still connected to les <b>ballets</b> C de la B.
