25|$|By 3 September 1972, U.S. {{tactical}} {{air power}} could not strike {{in support of}} Task Force Delta as it no longer had friendly defenses to support. Delta was in full flight. To add to the Royalist soldiers' woes, about 600 of them developed trench foot after a week without removing footwear. Among their other woes, they had to revert to going <b>bare</b> <b>foot.</b> Task Force Delta was finished as a fighting entity.|$|E
25|$|Friction ridge skin {{present on}} the soles of the feet and toes (plantar surfaces) is as unique in its ridge detail as are the fingers and palms (palmar surfaces). When {{recovered}} at crime scenes or on items of evidence, sole and toe impressions {{can be used in}} the same manner as finger and palm prints to effect identifications. The footprints of infants, along with the thumb or index finger prints of mothers, are still commonly recorded in hospitals to assist in verifying the identity of infants. It is not uncommon for military records of flight personnel to include <b>bare</b> <b>foot</b> inked impressions. Friction ridge skin protected inside flight boots tends to survive the trauma of a plane crash (and accompanying fire) better than fingers.|$|E
500|$|The poet Robert Browning and {{his wife}} Elizabeth {{attended}} a séance on 23, July 1855 in Ealing with the Rymers. It is alleged that during the séance a spirit face materialized which Home claimed {{was the son of}} Browning who had died in infancy. Browning seized the [...] "materialization" [...] and discovered it to be the <b>bare</b> <b>foot</b> of Home. To make the deception worse, Browning had never lost a son in infancy. Browning's son Robert {{in a letter to the}} London Times, December 5, 1902 referred to the incident: [...] "Home was detected in a vulgar fraud." [...] The Browning allegation of fraud was supported by the magician Harry Houdini. However, Andrew Lang disputed the allegation, stating there was contradictory information about the séance from Browning {{and his wife}}.|$|E

500|$|Lisa Backwell {{described}} {{the filming of}} the ball as her [...] "most favourite, most mental day of filming". At {{the end of the}} final take of Pandora's dancing with Doug, the students' head of year, the entire crew danced into shot. Director Charles Martin was initially dubious of whether Megan and Kathryn Prescott would be able to film Katie and Emily's fight well enough, but Kathryn said that on their first rehearsal they [...] "did it a bit too properly", ripping out parts of Megan's hair extensions. Emily's accidental punching of Doug during the fight was choreographed so that when Kathryn Prescott punched the air in front of Giles Thomas's face, the camera angle would make it appear that she was actually hitting him. While they were filming, however, Prescott genuinely punched Thomas by accident, causing him to stumble back and step on Megan Prescott's <b>bare</b> <b>foot,</b> which she injured.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} has also drawn {{comparisons}} to Tarsem Singh's films, The Cell (2000) and The Fall (2006), {{in the sense}} that they both incorporate elements of Islamic mystic imagery, such as in the scene where the Sufi dance is executed, as well as the floating cube. According to writer Brad Brevet, who observed the similarities, deduced that both the video and the films deal with tapping into the subconscious of the human mind [...] and hence the resulting strange visuals were directly an influence from [...] "Bedtime Story". James Steffen, author of The Cinema of Sergei Parajanov, found that some of the imagery in the video were directly lifted from the 1969 Soviet film, The Color of Pomegranates, including the scenes showing a <b>bare</b> <b>foot</b> crushing grapes over a slab inscribed with Arabic, and a scene showing a bishop's croziers falling into hand. Steffen also noted that Romanek's influences for the video included the works of Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky, including Stalker (1979) and Nostalghia (1983). Jake Hall from Dazed declared [...] "Bedtime story" [...] as the blueprint for [...] "90s brand of futurism", adding that the video [...] "eschews the obvious and instead relies on undulating CGI".|$|E
2500|$|According to Harper's New Monthly Magazine, {{toward the}} end of his career, he was present when an {{itinerant}} missionary was exhorting an open-air congregation in Mansfield, Ohio. The sermon was long and severe on the topic of extravagance, because the pioneers were buying such indulgences as calico and imported tea. [...] "Where now is there a man who, like the primitive Christians, is traveling to heaven barefooted and clad in coarse raiment?" [...] the preacher repeatedly asked until Johnny Appleseed, his endurance worn out, walked up to the preacher, put his <b>bare</b> <b>foot</b> on the stump that had served as a podium, and said, [...] "Here's your primitive Christian!" [...] The flummoxed sermonizer dismissed the congregation.|$|E
