5|$|The President of Croatia enjoys immunity—the {{president}} {{may not be}} arrested, nor can any criminal proceedings be instituted against the president without prior consent from the Constitutional Court. The only case in which immunity does not apply is if the president has <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> act of committing a criminal offense, which carries a penalty of imprisonment {{for more than five}} years. In such a case the state body that has detained the president must notify the President of the Constitutional Court immediately.|$|E
5|$|L'Hermite's {{force had}} <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same {{hurricane}} that had dispersed Willaumez, {{and as a}} result his ships were scattered and damaged on 20 August, one frigate joining the remains of Willaumez's squadron in the United States and the others limping back to France. Most succeeded in slipping through the British blockade independently, including Régulus, which arrived at Brest on 5 October, but one ship was less successful: on 27 September 1806 the frigate Président became the final French casualty of the campaign when it was trapped in the Bay of Biscay by Louis' squadron. Closed in from all sides, the approach of Louis' flagship Canopus convinced Captain Labrosse that continued resistance was impossible and he struck his colours without a fight.|$|E

25|$|The River Mole has {{the most}} diverse fish {{population}} of any river in England. The Gatwick Stream is dominated by coarse fish such as brown trout, brook lamprey, and eel. In 2003, the upper River Mole near Meath Green Lane, Horley, was enhanced to create a gravel spawning area to encourage chub and dace in addition to roach. In 1974 zander, a non-indigenous coarse fish native to Europe, were introduced legally to Old Bury Hill Lake which supplies the Pipp Brook.

25|$|Not {{long after}} the explosion, the UVF unit opened fire on those {{gathered}} outside the wrecked pub, including those who had <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blast. A British Army spokesman said that the shooting began at about 5:35 PM, when 30 high-velocity shots were heard. Social Democratic and Labour Party Member of Parliament Gerry Fitt said that shots had been fired from the Springmartin estate only minutes after the bombing. William Whitelaw, however, claimed that the shooting did not begin until 40 minutes after the blast. Ambulances braved the gunfire to reach the wounded, which included a number of children. Tommy McIlroy (50), a Catholic civilian who worked at Kelly's Bar, {{was shot in the}} chest and killed outright. He was the first to be killed in the violence.|$|E
25|$|Spiders are {{notified}} {{that potential}} prey has <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> web through vibrations along strands, {{these can be}} followed to the prey location on the web and be used to estimate prey size. Due to the large variety in prey Nephila has different attack techniques dependent on prey size. Small prey like flies are captured alive then removed from the web and wrapped in silk. This occurs with smaller prey {{because they do not}} present a threat to the spider when alive. Prey that is seen as potentially threatening will be bitten to be subdued before wrapping. Medium-sized prey will receive bites that are sustained until prey is immobilised and then be covered in silk. Finally, the largest captured prey receive the –bite and back off– treatment where a single lunging bite is made before the spider withdraws and waits for the venom to take effect before wrapping. This lunging bite is often repeated to speed up the process of immobilisation.|$|E
25|$|Finally, at 13:26 on 15 June 1965, after silently {{lying in}} ambush for three days, the Australians {{observed}} a large Indonesian {{force to the}} east, moving close together one behind the other with their weapons slung. Wearing mostly green uniforms and US steel helmets and webbing, and armed with AR-15 Armalite rifles, they {{were believed to be}} regular soldiers from J BTP. Waiting until about 25 Indonesians had entered the engagement area, Byers initiated the ambush with a burst for his Owen submachine gun, with at least 12 killed in the initial fighting. The first three Indonesian soldiers had initially escaped unscathed, and they ran down the track to the west, only to be killed instantly by Claymores fired by the Australian cut-off party. However, with the Indonesian force numbering up to 100 men, only the lead elements had <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Australian ambush and they responded with mortar and machine-gun fire, {{as well as a number}} of grenades that failed to explode.|$|E
