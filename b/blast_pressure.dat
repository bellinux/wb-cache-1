5|$|The battle {{began as}} a {{long-range}} gunnery duel, during which the Russian ships hit the Japanese ships numerous times and forced Tōgō to temporarily disengage. Over two hours {{after the start of}} the battle, the Japanese fleet closed the range and started shooting again at 17:35. Forty minutes later a shell struck Retzivans forward turret near the gun ports, killing one turret crewman and wounding six others from the <b>blast</b> <b>pressure.</b> The impact knocked one 12-inch shell off its loading tray, crushing two other sailors and also setting fire to the canvas covering the gun ports. Fearing that the fire might spread, the surviving crewmen flooded the turret, knocking out its electrical system. The crew was able to get the turret partially functional within an hour.|$|E

It was also {{the location of the}} generators that provided electric power, and recharged the batteries of portable devices, and ultra-high-speed cameras operating at up to 8,000 frames per second. Other camera equipment was set up on Alpha Island and Northwest Island. Most of the monitoring equipment was positioned on Trimouille Island, closer to the explosion. Here, there were a plethora of <b>blast,</b> <b>pressure</b> and seismographic gauges. There were also some 200 empty petrol tins for measuring the blast, a technique that Penney had employed on Operation Crossroads. There were thermometers and calorimeters for measuring the flash, and samples of paints and fabrics for determining the effect on them. Plants would be studied to measure their uptake of fission products, particularly radioactive iodine and strontium. Stores were unloaded at beachhead H2 on Hermite Island, from whence the RAAF had built a road to H1. A stores compound was established at Gladstone Beach on Trimouille Island, known as T3.|$|E

40|$|Glass {{curtain walls}} {{are used in}} modern {{buildings}} as envelopes for wide surfaces due to a multitude of aspects. In glass curtain walls, tensile brittle panels are connected - through mechanical or adhesive joints - with steel frameworks or aluminum bracing systems, and due to the interaction of several structural components, the behaviour of the so assembled system is complex to predict, especially under exceptional loading conditions such as explosive events. In the paper, glazing curtain walls are investigated by means of Finite-Element (FE) numerical simulations, under the effect of air <b>blast</b> <b>pressures</b> of variable intensity. Their typical dynamic behaviour and criticalities under high-strain impact loads are first analyzed. By means of extended nonlinear dynamic FE parametric studies, innovative devices are applied to traditional curtain walls, at their support points, {{in order to improve}} their expected dynamic response. Two possible solutions, namely consisting of viscoelastic (VE) or elasto-plastic (PL) dampers, are proposed as passive control systems for the mitigation of maximum effects in the façade components deriving from the incoming <b>blast</b> <b>pressures.</b> As shown, although characterized by specific intrinsic mechanical behaviours, either VE or PL dampers can offer beneficial structural effects. In the first case, major advantages for the façade components derive from the additional flexibility and damping capacities of VE devices. In the latter case, PL dampers introduce additional plastic energy dissipation in the traditional curtain wall assembly, hence allowing preventing severe damage in the glazing components. It is thus expected that the current outcomes could represent a valid background for further experimental validation as well as detailed assessment and optimization of the proposed design concept...|$|R

The work aims to establish if rail vehicle design could influence the distribution of passenger injuries within a rail vehicle. Finite element models were used to predict the detonation and propagation of the <b>blast</b> <b>pressures,</b> and the structural response of a rail vehicle. Models were developed to allow the prediction of human injury, using validated work from the open literature and from basic principles. After a detailed review of existing work on injury, chest injury from <b>blast</b> <b>pressures</b> and penetrating injuries from high speed projectiles were chosen as the injury modes {{to be included in}} the model. To provide data to validate numerical models, experimental blast testing in confined geometry was undertaken. Four configurations of a test cell were used to gain an understanding of the effect of vertical baffles on pressures and cumulative impulse. Excellent correlation was seen between test shots in each arrangement. Baffles were seen to increase the cumulative impulse seen at the wall opposite where they were fixed, although the number and spacing of them was seen to have no significant effect. Numerical modelling of the experimental test arrangements showed good correlation between the experimental pressure time history data and the numerical predictions. Secondary combustion was considered using an energy release function, after which cumulative impulse calculated from experimental data were was predicted by the numerical models. Risk prediction and finite element models were combined to model the effects of an IED blast in a representative rail vehicle. A number of key variables were studied, and it was identified that although rail vehicle design can affect the injury severity, passenger spatial density was the driver for determining the distribution of injuries...|$|R
