25|$|Spherical {{aberration}} {{occurs because}} spherical surfaces {{are not the}} ideal shape for a lens, but {{are by far the}} simplest shape to which glass can be ground and polished, and so are often used. Spherical aberration causes beams parallel to, but distant from, the lens axis to be focused in a slightly different place than beams close to the axis. This manifests itself as a blurring of the image. Lenses in which closer-to-ideal, non-spherical surfaces are used are called aspheric lenses. These were formerly complex to make and often extremely expensive, but advances in technology have greatly reduced the manufacturing cost for such lenses. Spherical aberration can be minimised by carefully choosing the surface curvatures for a particular application. For instance, a plano-convex lens, which is used to focus a collimated beam, produces a sharper focal spot when used with the convex side towards the <b>beam</b> <b>source.</b>|$|E

Aspects relevant for microfabrication related to grid optics, and the use of reactive gases, are discussed. Most important in this context are the internal microdivergence of an ion beam and the fragmentation of molecular gases taking place in the source and the ion beam as well.

2500|$|Protons {{may also}} be used in {{radiosurgery}} in a procedure called Proton Beam Therapy (PBT) or proton therapy. Protons are extracted from proton donor materials by a medical synchrotron or cyclotron, and accelerated in successive transits through a circular, evacuated conduit or cavity, using powerful magnets to shape their path, until they reach the energy required to just traverse a human body, usually about 200MeV. They are then released toward the region to be treated in the patient's body, the irradiation target. In some machines, which deliver protons of only a specific energy, a custom mask made of plastic is interposed between the <b>beam</b> <b>source</b> and the patient to adjust the beam energy to provide the appropriate degree of penetration. The phenomenon of the Bragg peak of ejected protons gives proton therapy advantages over other forms of radiation, {{since most of the}} proton's energy is deposited within a limited distance, so tissue beyond this range (and to some extent also tissue inside this range) is spared from the effects of radiation. This property of protons, which has been called the [...] "depth charge effect" [...] by analogy to the explosive weapons used in anti-submarine warfare, allows for conformal dose distributions to be created around even very irregularly shaped targets, and for higher doses to targets surrounded or backstopped by radiation-sensitive structures such as the optic chiasm or brainstem. The development of [...] "intensity modulated" [...] techniques allowed similar conformities to be attained using linear accelerator radiosurgery.|$|E

Development and applications of high power thermionic electron <b>beam</b> <b>sources</b> have been studied in this work. A detailed account of the three types, strip, line and hairpin thermionic electron <b>beam</b> <b>sources,</b> which have been developed and experimented has been given. These sources are employed in a diode configuration with different beam trajectories (axial and transverse) and heating modes (directly and indirectly). Performance of these sources has been described at temperature and space charge limited modes of operation. We obtain constant and stable focal spots at the work site that are in good agreement with the designed dimensions of the sources. High emission current, low thermal efficiency and high power density at the work-site have been recorded with an extended life expectancy (up to 100 hours). This was possible through novel design parameters for these sources by protecting them from arcing and shortening even at high vacuum (10 - 6 - 10 - 3 Torr). These electron beam guns produce beautiful seam geometry with the penetration depth up to 5 mm and evaporation rates (up to order of 100 kg/h) for refractory metals, with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV only. Besides scientific applications, these guns can also be used in large-scale vacuum metallurgy plants for melting, welding, coating and heat treatment. Guns are very simple in construction, economical to manufacture and have high reliability and performance in operation. Finally, the results have been concluded with regard to three types of electron <b>beam</b> <b>sources...</b>|$|R
50|$|In March 2011, Chinese {{scientists}} {{posited that}} {{a specific type}} of Bessel beam (a special kind of laser that that does not diffract at the centre) is capable of creating a pull-like effect on a given microscopic particle, forcing it towards the <b>beam</b> <b>source.</b> The underlining physics is the maximization of forward scattering via interference of the radiation multipoles. They show explicitly that the necessary condition to realize a negative (pulling) optical force is the simultaneous excitation of multipoles in the particle and if the projection of the total photon momentum along the propagation direction is small, attractive optical force is possible. The Chinese scientists suggest this possibility may be implemented for optical micromanipulation.|$|E

A white <b>beam</b> <b>source</b> - emitting light of multiple wavelengths - is focused on a sample (the complementary color pairs are indicated by the yellow dotted lines). Upon striking the sample, photons that match the energy gap of the molecules present (green light in this example) are absorbed in order to excite the molecule. Other photons transmit unaffected and, if the radiation is in the visible region (400-700nm), the sample color is the complementary color of the absorbed light. By comparing the attenuation of the transmitted light with the incident, an absorption spectrum can be obtained.|$|E
5000|$|A {{nephelometer}} [...] is {{an instrument}} for measuring concentration of suspended particulates in a liquid or gas colloid. A nephelometer measures suspended particulates by employing a light <b>beam</b> (<b>source</b> beam) and a light detector set to one side (often 90°) of the source beam.

Nephelometers are calibrated to a known particulate, then use environmental factors (k-factors) to compensate lighter or darker colored dusts accordingly. K-factor is determined by the user by running the nephelometer next to an air sampling pump and comparing results.
