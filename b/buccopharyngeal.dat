5|$|Amphibians are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} frogs, salamanders and caecilians. They are tetrapods, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock {{with each other and}} have articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, but contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping, a pump action in which air is first drawn into the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are ectothermic (cold-blooded) {{vertebrates}} that do {{not maintain}} their body temperature through internal physiological processes. Their metabolic rate is low and as a result, their food and energy requirements are limited. In the adult state, they have tear ducts and movable eyelids, and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations. They have muscular tongues, which in many species can be protruded. Modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, apart from a few fish-like scales in certain caecilians. The skin contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands (a type of granular gland). The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults.

50|$|The <b>buccopharyngeal</b> fascia is a fascia in the head.|$|E
50|$|The {{muscle is}} divided into four parts: A pterygopharyngeal, <b>buccopharyngeal,</b> mylopharyngeal and a {{glossopharyngeal}} part.|$|E
50|$|The {{region where}} the crescentic {{masses of the}} {{ectoderm}} and endoderm come into direct {{contact with each other}} constitutes a thin membrane, the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> membrane (or oropharyngeal membrane), which forms a septum between the primitive mouth and pharynx. In front of the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> area, where the lateral crescents of mesoderm fuse in the middle line, the pericardium is afterward developed, and this region is therefore designated the pericardial area.|$|E
50|$|The stomodeum {{is lined}} by ectoderm, and is {{separated}} from the anterior end of the fore-gut by the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> membrane.|$|E
50|$|Milnesium almatyense is {{a species}} of Eutardigrades in the family Milnesiidae. This species differs from its cogenerate species mainly by {{proportions}} of its claws and <b>buccopharyngeal</b> apparatus.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Human embryo {{about fifteen}} days old. Brain and heart {{represented}} from right side. Digestive tube and yolk sacin median section. (<b>Buccopharyngeal</b> membrane labeled in upper left.) ...|$|E
50|$|With {{the further}} {{expansion}} of the brain, and the forward bulging of the pericardium, the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> membrane is depressed between these two prominences. This depression constitutes the stomodeum.|$|E
50|$|Some {{species are}} {{considered}} air-breathing fishes {{because of their}} ability to breathe by highly vascularized <b>buccopharyngeal</b> pouches (pharynx modified for breathing air). They usually are active only at night.|$|E
50|$|It {{is limited}} above by {{the base of}} the skull, and below where the alar fascia fuses with the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> fascia at about the level of T4 and the carina.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} aquatic turtles, the saw-shelled turtle {{is able to}} obtain oxygen from water through skin, cloaca, and <b>buccopharyngeal</b> cavity, thus {{extending}} its ability to stay under water for prolonged periods.|$|E
50|$|The retropharyngeal {{space is}} found {{anterior}} {{to the danger}} zone, between the alar fascia and <b>buccopharyngeal</b> fascia. There exists a midline raphe in this space so some infections of this space appear unilateral.|$|E
50|$|By {{the growth}} of the head end of the embryo, and the {{formation}} of the cephalic flexure, the pericardial area and the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> membrane come to lie on the ventral surface of the embryo.|$|E
50|$|In embryogenesis, Rathke's pouch is an evagination at {{the roof}} of the {{developing}} mouth in front of the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> membrane. It gives rise to the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis), a part of the endocrine system.|$|E
50|$|The retropharyngeal {{space is}} a {{potential}} space {{of the head and}} neck, bounded by the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> fascia anteriorly and the alar fascia posteriorly. Together with the lateral pharyngeal space, these spaces are termed the parapharyngeal spaces.|$|E
50|$|The pterygomandibular raphe (pterygomandibular ligament) is a ligamentous {{band of the}} <b>buccopharyngeal</b> fascia, {{attached}} superiorly to the pterygoid hamulus of {{the medial}} pterygoid plate, and inferiorly to the posterior end of the mylohyoid line of the mandible.|$|E
5000|$|The retropharyngeal lymph nodes, {{from one}} to three in number, lie in the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> fascia, behind {{the upper part of}} the pharynx and in front of the arch of the atlas, being separated, however, from the latter by the Longus capitis.|$|E
5000|$|Parallel to the carotid sheath {{and along}} its medial aspect the pretracheal fascia gives off a thin lamina, the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> fascia, which closely invests the {{constrictor}} {{muscles of the}} pharynx and is continued forward from the constrictor pharyngis superior onto the buccinator.|$|E
50|$|Halzoun it is a {{local name}} of a <b>buccopharyngeal</b> {{infection}} occurring in Lebanon, probably caused by pentastomida larvae of Linguatula serrata (dog tongue worm) which wander into the throat of the human host after ingestion of infected raw liver or lymph nodes from sheep or goats.|$|E
50|$|In humans, the {{development}} proceeds differently. The <b>buccopharyngeal</b> membrane is {{created in the}} foregut and it is perforated during the 4th week of human development, creating the primitive mouth, whereas the cloacal membrane is created in the hindgut and it is perforated during the 8th week of human development, creating the primitive anus after the mouth opening has already been created.|$|E
5000|$|The four {{parts of}} this muscle arise from:- the lower third of the {{posterior}} margin of the medial pterygoid plate and its hamulus (Pterygopharyngeal part)- from the pterygomandibular raphe (<b>Buccopharyngeal</b> part)- from the alveolar process of the mandible above the posterior end of the mylohyoid line (Mylopharyngeal part)- and by a few fibers {{from the side of}} the tongue (Glossopharyngeal part) ...|$|E
50|$|These mudsuckers {{occur in}} estuaries, {{primarily}} in tidal sloughs with shallow mud-covered bottoms, where they often excavate burrows. When the tide {{goes out and}} the mud is exposed, they will retreat to their burrows or move into tidal channels; if trapped on the mud, they can {{wait for the next}} tide by gulping air <b>buccopharyngeal</b> chamber in the throat. They feed on nearly anything they can find in the mud, including small fish such as California killifish, but mostly live on invertebrates, the main choices depending on seasonal availability.|$|E
50|$|In {{front of}} the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> area, where the lateral crescents of {{mesoderm}} fuse in the middle line, the pericardium is afterward developed, and this region is therefore designated the pericardial area. A second region where the mesoderm is absent, {{at least for a}} time, is that immediately in {{front of the}} pericardial area. This is termed the proamniotic area, and is the region where the proamnion is developed; in humans, however, it appears that a proamnion is never formed. A third region is at the hind end of the embryo, where the ectoderm and endoderm come into apposition and form the cloacal membrane.|$|E
50|$|The {{extension}} of the mesoderm takes place throughout {{the whole of the}} embryonic and extra-embryonic areas of the ovum, except in certain regions. One of these is seen immediately in front of the neural tube. Here the mesoderm extends forward in the form of two crescentic masses, which meet in the middle line so as to enclose behind them an area that is devoid of mesoderm. Over this area, the ectoderm and endoderm come into direct contact with each other and constitute a thin membrane, the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> membrane, which forms a septum between the primitive mouth and pharynx.|$|E
50|$|Platyrhina {{species have}} rounded, {{heart-shaped}} pectoral fin discs with short, blunt snouts. Their tails {{are long and}} shark-like, slightly flattened with lateral ridges. The two dorsal fins and the caudal fin are large and rounded; the caudal fin lacks a lower lobe. The teeth are small and arranged in pavement-like rows for crushing shelled prey. Their bodies are covered with minute dermal denticles; also, several rows of denticles are located inside the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> cavity. The shape of these denticles in Platyrhina and the similar Platyrhinoidis distinguish them from all other guitarfish species. Large thorns occur around the eyes and on the shoulders, and are arranged in rows along the back and tail. Unlike Platyrhinoidis, Platyrhina species have an additional lateral row of thorns {{on both sides of}} the tail, and no rostral thorns.|$|E
50|$|The tooth {{files are}} whorl-shaped and the palatoquadrate is {{scalloped}} with 6-7 recesses {{to allow for}} the tooth families. The individual teeth are widely separated from each other in the tooth whorls. The teeth themselves are of the cladodont variety; the bases of the teeth are broadest on the lingual side, and each support a single large cusp and two pairs of smaller accessory cusps for a total of five cusps. The medial and most lateral cusps are the most fluted. The teeth appear to be mostly orthodentine, but when viewed in cross-section, change abruptly to osteodentine. The enameloid is single-layered, overlaying the thick mantle of orthodentine. In addition to the dentition teeth, there are also a number of <b>buccopharyngeal</b> denticles lining the oropharynx. The denticles lining {{the top of the head}} and the top of the spine-brush complex are larger than the dentition teeth, and they appear as elongate monocuspid denticles.|$|E

5000|$|In Elginerpeton pancheni, a proto{{tetrapod}} {{from the}} late Frasnian, basic tetrapod characteristics in the lower jaw and the cranium are observed. The taxon is believed {{to fill the gap}} between elpistostegalid fishes and well-preserved Devonian tetrapods. The Elginerpeton is considered more derived than the elpistostegalid fishes due to presence of paired fangs on the parasymphysial toothplate, a slender shaped anterior coronoid, and in the loss of the intracranial joint and coronoid fossa. The loss of the intercranial joint was a direct functional necessity to strengthen the broad and long platybasic skull when the animal was out of the water. [...] The tubular lower jaw of the Elginerpeton, compared to the flat-lamina jaw shape of fishes gave it superior cross-sectional force, required when not supported in an aquatic setting - allowing for opening of the mouth outside of water. The adaptation may also be interpreted as a specialization for <b>buccopharyngeal</b> breathing. It is speculated to be the first step towards aerial respiration in the transition from fish to tetrapod.|$|E
50|$|The dental lamina is {{a band of}} {{epithelial}} tissue seen in histologic sections of a developing tooth. The dental lamina is first evidence of tooth development and begins (in humans) at the sixth week in utero or {{three weeks after the}} rupture of the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> membrane. It is formed when cells of the oral ectoderm proliferate faster than cells of other areas. Best described as an in-growth of oral ectoderm, the dental lamina is frequently distinguished from the vestibular lamina, which develops concurrently. This dividing tissue is surrounded by and, some would argue, stimulated by ectomesenchymal growth. When it is present, the dental lamina connects the developing tooth bud to the epithelium of the oral cavity. Eventually, the dental lamina disintegrates into small clusters of epithelium and is resorbed. In situations when the clusters are not resorbed, (this remnant of the dental lamina is sometimes known as the glands of Serres) eruption cysts are formed over the developing tooth and delay its eruption into the oral cavity. This invagination of ectodermal tissues is the progenitor to the later ameloblasts and enamel while the ectomesenchyme is responsible for the dental papilla and later odontoblasts.|$|E
50|$|The eastern spotted {{gummy shark}} (Mustelus walkeri) is {{a species of}} houndshark in the Triakidae family, found in Australian waters. This new species of gummy sharks is a {{relatively}} large species with the following characteristics: tall dorsal fins, its posterior margin directed posteroventrally {{from top to bottom}} and not upright distally, first dorsal-fin base is 1.6-2.0 times the anal-caudal space; <b>buccopharyngeal</b> denticles cover entire palate and floor of mouth; long claspers of adult males are slender, strongly depressed, the inner length about 9-10% TL, extending to just anterior of the second dorsal-fin origin; lower edge of spiracle is usually close to level of mid-eye; insertion of anal-fin usually over its apex; about 69/73 teeth rows; 78- 94 precaudal vertebral centra; 35-39 monospondylous centra; dorsal color pale greyish with numerous small, often indistinct, semi-regular, diffuse-edged white spots on postspiracular head and body; light and dark tonal coloration well demarcated on head below eye and onto middle of first gill slit, the intergill membranes are much darker dorsally than ventrally; bases and inner lobe of dorsal fins in juveniles (<400 mm TL) not strongly contrasted to distal part of fin, inner lobe is pale-edged; juveniles have caudal fin with distinctive whitish posterior margins.|$|E

40|$|Inertial suction feeding is {{the most}} common method of prey capture among aquatic vertebrates. However, it had been unclear whether the aquatic frogs in the family Pipidae also used {{inertial}} suction for prey capture. In this study, we examined feeding behavior in four species of pipids, Pipa pipa, Xenopus laevis, Hymenochirus boettgeri and Pseudhymenochirus merlini. Pressure in the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> cavity was measured during prey capture. These pressure measurements were coupled with high-speed recordings of feeding behavior. For each species, the internal <b>buccopharyngeal</b> pressure was found to drop significantly below ambient pressure, and changes in pressure corresponded with the onset of mouth opening. Kinematic analysis revealed that all species of pipids generated subambient pressure during prey capture; H. boettgeri and P. merlini relied solely on inertial suction feeding. Pipa pipa and X. laevis additionally employed forelimb scooping during prey capture but both of these species demonstrated the ability to capture prey with inertial suction alone. Based on <b>buccopharyngeal</b> pressure measurements as well as kinematic analyses, we conclude that inertial suction feeding is used during prey capture in these four species of pipids...|$|E
