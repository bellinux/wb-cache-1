30|$|The SESBE (smart {{elements}} for sustainable building envelopes) project, {{funded by the}} European Commission, focused on developing smart façade elements which are lighter, thinner and more adaptive than existing solutions through the utilization of nanomaterials and nanotechnology. The use of smart cost effective raw materials and cost saving technologies resulted in façade elements with increased energy efficiency, fire resistance and surface functionality. Prefabricated and non-load <b>bearing</b> <b>sandwich</b> façade elements were developed using a high-performance composite material, namely TRRPC, for {{the inner and outer}} layers, while low density foamed concrete (FC) made up the insulating core layer. Glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) continuous connecting devices were incorporated to allow for partial composite action between the facing layers, all while minimizing the self-weight of the element and thermal bridges.|$|E
30|$|Within the EC funded project smart {{elements}} for sustainable building envelopes, carbon textile reinforcement {{was incorporated into}} reactive powder concrete, namely textile reinforced reactive powder concrete (TRRPC), to additionally improve the post-cracking behaviour of the cementitious matrix. This high-performance composite material was included as outer and inner façade panels in prefabricated and non-load <b>bearing</b> <b>sandwich</b> elements along with low density foamed concrete (FC) and glass fibre reinforced polymer continuous connecting devices. Experiments and finite element analysis (FEA) were applied to characterize the structural performance of the developed sandwich elements. The mechanical behaviour of the individual materials, components and large-scale elements were quantified. Four-point bending tests were performed on large-scale TRRPC-FC sandwich element beams to quantify the flexural capacity, level of composite action, resulting deformation, crack propagation and failure mechanisms. Optical measurements based on digital image correlation were taken simultaneously to enable {{a detailed analysis of}} the underlying composite action. The structural behaviour of the developed elements was found to be highly dependent on the stiffness and strength of the connectors to ensure composite action between the two TRRPC panels. As for the FEA, the applied modelling approach was found to accurately describe the stiffness of the sandwich elements at lower load levels, while describing the stiffness in a conservative manner after the occurrence of connector failure mechanisms.|$|E
40|$|In current {{research}} wood based sandwich panels with the Den-droLight® cellular core {{have been investigated}} numerically and experimentally. Application of DendroLight® cellular wood material is novel in engineering practice thus technological and quality assurance aspects should be elaborated in more detail. Den-droLight® is made from profiled wood boards stacked in perpen-dicular layers and sliced in perpendicular direction to board’s layer plane. Obtaining reduced weight of such a structure (approximately 60 % of solid wood), it is mainly used in furniture industry as core material for laminated sandwich panels. However improved mul-tifunctional properties (like thermal resistance and sound isolation) of such material, has a potential of utilising it as core layer also in building structures as load <b>bearing</b> <b>sandwich</b> panels for example walls and floors. Thus achieving the multifunctionality of proposed concept where material play significant role for developing new generation of building structures [1]. One of the problems restricting production of the load <b>bearing</b> <b>sandwich</b> panels is lack of reliable design tool to predict mechanical, thermal and acoustic isolation properties of various configuration sandwich panels. The complex topology of the DendroLight® makes it difficult task for analytical predictions to match the actual behavior of the structure under the physical load. In contrary, the numerical finite element (FE) analysis allows to simulate sandwich panels studying the cellular wood core behavior under any loading condition with considerable reliability. The aim of {{current research}} was to create the FE model of sandwich panel with DendroLight® core, and to verify its mechanical and thermal properties compared with the physical tests. Commercially available FE software ANSYS {{has been used for}} the simulation task. To describe DendroLight® structure, SHELL el-ements with transverse isotropic wood mechanical properties have been used (Fig. 1). Corresponding properties of the plywood or the high density fiberboard (HDF) also were assigned for the sandwich panel skins. Geometrical properties of the sandwich panel and the core web thicknesses have been made as parametrical values bearing in mind further need to utilize developed model for opti-mization task. During the research it has been identified that model with detailed core structure is reasonable solution only for small scale sandwich specimens with the length not exceeding 1 m. For larger structures it is more reasonable to use the core layer with equivalent DendroLight® stiffness [2]. As determining of the equivalent stiffness also was in scope of the current research. Step by step model validation is essentially important for creating of numerical model with realistic mechanical behavior. For this reason series of mechanical tests under various loading modes have been performed on ZWICK Z 100 testing machine. Six different series of bending specimens and four series of compression specimens have been experimentally tested. The bending test set-up has been used to test the sandwich beams with 50 mm width and various thicknesses and the skin materials (Fig. 2). Compression tests were performed on specimens with overall dimensions 40 x 200 x 200 – according to EN 789 standard [3]. Deformation of the specimens has been measured mainly by the crosshead displacement of the machine. For several specimens the strain gauges has been also attached on the lower skin surface. The deflections of four different series of bending specimens have been measured using non-contact optical measuring system ARAMIS (Fig. 3). Usage of optical measuring system allows acquiring deformation values for any position on specimen cross section and it gives wider opportunities to verify numerical and experimental deformation results (Fig. 4). The thermal flux q values calculated with DendroLight® numerical model created in ANSYS (Fig. 5) has been verified with experi-mentally acquire...|$|E

The mechanical properties of the sandwich structure were investigated by the finite element analysis (FEA) and three-point bending methods. The calculated bending stiffness and core shear stress were compared to {{the characteristics of a}} honeycomb sandwich structure. The results indicated that the triangular core ultimately failed under a bending load of 11000 [*]N; the principal stress concentration was located at the loading region; and the cracks occurred on the interface top skin and triangular core.

40|$|AbstractThe {{analytical}} and numerical modeling {{of the structural}} response of a prismatic metal sandwich tube subjected to internal moving pressure loading is investigated in this paper. The prismatic core is equivalent to homogeneous and cylindrical orthotropic solids via homogenization procedure. The sandwich tube with the “effective” homogenized core is modeled using multi-layer sandwich theory considering the effects of transverse shear deformation and compressibility of the core; moreover, the solutions are obtained by using the precise integration method. Several dynamic elastic finite element (FE) simulations are carried out to obtain the structural response of the tube to shock loading moving at different velocities. The comparison between analytic solutions and FE simulations demonstrates that the transient analytical model, based on the proposed sandwich model, is capable of predicting the critical velocity and the dynamic structural response of the sandwich tube with the “effective” homogenized core {{with a high degree}} of accuracy. In addition, the critical velocity predicted using FE simulations of the complete model is not in agreement with that of the effective model. However, the structural response and the maximum amplification factors obtained using FE simulations of the complete model are nearly similar to that of the effective model, when the shock loading moves at the critical velocity. The influences of the relative density on the structural response are studied, and the capabilities of load <b>bearing</b> for <b>sandwich</b> tubes with different cores are compared with each other and with the monolithic tube. The results indicate that Kagome and triangle- 6 are preferred among five topologies...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of mineral admixtures as partial cement replacement in concrete {{leads to a}} reduction in construction cost. Usually single mixture has limitation and some have contrasting influences on properties of concrete. The combination of more kinds of mineral admixtures is postulated to improve concrete properties. Since RHA is highly reactive pozzolan, it has led to the idea of focusing the study on the performance of Multiblended pozzolan as partial cement replacement in mortar. Over 8 different mixes were produced in which four mixes contained varying percentages of admixtures (Multi Blended Cement, MBC) and the remainders were single mix (Binary Blended Cement, BBC) containing optimum percentages (based on literature study) of 20 % PFA, 20 % RHA, 50 % SLAG, and 10 % POFA. Three samples for each mix, curing period and parameter tests were prepared. This work initially deals with compressive strength characteristics, water absorption, and total porosity on mortar cured (standard curing) for 7, 28, 60 and 90 days. The performance of optimum MBC mortar was studied in terms of ultimate compressive strength, water absorption and total porosity. The strength properties of the optimum mixes of MBC mortars was also examined at different curing regimes. This research also focuses on studying some durability aspects of the optimum mix of MBC mortars namely acid attack, and carbonation. Besides, the effects of saline seawater were investigated for short term exposure. Finally attempt in brief study on suitability of the optimum mixes of MBC mortars as face sheets to produce lightweight non-load <b>bearing</b> <b>sandwich</b> block was conducted. From the results obtained, {{it was found that the}} strength of control and BBC mortars at early age on average were 20 % higher than MBC mortars, and at final age both were comparable with MBC mortars. The strength of all mortars at 90 days on average was 59 MPa. However, the MBC system produced low permeability mortar compared to control, and BBC mortars at all ages. The total porosity and water absorption of control and BBC were 28 % and 21 %, and 9 % and 14 %, respectively. The strength of MBC mortar after 45 cycles of wet and dry curing in seawater exhibited 24 % higher than control mortar. The initial water curing for 7 and 14 days and continuous air curing also exhibited 13 % and 19 %, and 21 % and 26 %, higher early strength than continuous water and air curing, respectively. The strength and durability properties of MBC mortar are more pronounced than control when it is iv provided with adequate curing. After exposure to chemical attack, the MBC mortar exhibits better resistance than control mortar. With adequate curing the MBC mortar was higher in durability than control mortar when subjected to chemical attack...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} a shear zone transecting the Hercynian {{basement}} of the Calabria - Peloritani terrane in the neighbourhood of Palmi is described for the first time. A structural analysis was carried out to outline the tectonic meaning of the shear zone. In addition, thermobarometry and geochronology allowed to define the structural level and age of deformation. The shear zone is localised along layers of calc-silicate bearing marbles near the contact between late Hercynian tonalites and migmatitic paragneisses. Marbles, interpreted as former skarns, still retain the original high temperature Hercynian mineral assemblage including diopside, grossular, anorthite-rich plagioclase ± scapolite ± hornblende. Deformation took place in greenschist facies at about 400 °C and 600 MPa. This event partially affected the peak assemblage in marbles, as documented by coronas of clinozoisite around anorthite-rich plagioclase. Rb-Sr method applied on two biotite separates coming from sheared gneisses gave Eocene ages of 51 and 56 Ma. The shear zone is broadly oriented WNW - ESE and shows nearly vertical foliation planes. Large scale folds undulate the foliation planes whose direction swings from NW - SE to NE-SW. Lineations generally show a shallow plunge with trends mostly spanning from E-W to NW-SE. In some cases lineations show a wide scatter in orientation and locally can be nearly vertical. Shear sense indicators and quartz c-axis distribution are coherent with sinistral kinematics along nearly horizontal lineations, and south side up displacement along steeply plunging lineations. The Palmi shear zone is interpreted as an early Alpine sinistral transpressive belt developed within weak calc-silicate <b>bearing</b> marbles <b>sandwiched</b> between the rigid domains of tonalites and migmatitic paragneisses. Due to sinistral transpression tonalites were uplifted {{with respect to the}} migmatitic paragneisses...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} and simulation investigations on out-plane compressive characteristics of FRP sandwich panel were conducted. The {{results show that}} two deformation stages are elastic deformation and fracture stages in out-plane compressive deformation. The yielding mode deformation as t 1 / h which is very big,while the buckling mode deformation as t 1 / h which is very small. The part 2 in the honeycomb core is main <b>bearing</b> part for <b>sandwich</b> panel,and the part 2 {{is supported by the}} part 1 and part 3 in the honeycomb core,while the honeycomb core is supported by the panel. So,the cell wall thickness of part 2 has the most significant influence on the compressive strength,and the influence by the cell wall side length of honeycomb core is the secondary,while the influence by the cell wall thickness of part 1 and part 3 in honeycomb core and the thickness of panel is the weakest. When the honeycomb core height is fixed,the compressive strength of FRP sandwich panel gradually increases along with honeycomb core layers increase...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. All steel {{laser welded}} {{sandwich}} plates {{have found their}} position in the marine and land vehicles. To implement such design accurately, knowledge about its strength properties and the influence of laser weld dimensions on strength is necessary. In this paper, the over-hanging three point bending tests were conducted on the laser welded web-core steel sandwich plate with various weld dimensions by self-designed device, together with the finite element simulations. The results show that the joint is formed on the first plastic hinge when the load is no longer a linear relationship with the deflection, and the joint cracking when the load reaches the maximum <b>bearing</b> capacity of <b>sandwich</b> plate. The joint yield load and the maximum bearing capacity of the sandwich plates increased with the increasing of weld width. Meanwhile, the mode of failure of sandwich plates also changed: When the weld width is smaller, the mode of failure is joint yield, When the weld width is greater than 3 mm, the mode of failure is the combination of partial joint yield, face plate and core plate local yield, while the face plate and core plate yield exists in the whole weld joint. It is necessary to consider the weld width in the design and evaluation of the strength of the laser welded web-core sandwich plate...|$|R
