5|$|Dietary {{supplements}} often contain vitamins, but {{may also}} include other ingredients, such as minerals, herbs, and <b>botanicals.</b> Scientific evidence supports the benefits of dietary supplements for persons with certain health conditions. In some cases, vitamin supplements may have unwanted effects, especially if taken before surgery, with other dietary supplements or medicines, or if the person taking them has certain health conditions. They may also contain levels of vitamins many times higher, and in different forms, than one may ingest through food.|$|E
25|$|Popular <b>botanicals</b> or {{flavouring}} {{agents for}} gin, besides the required juniper, often include citrus elements, such as lemon and bitter orange peel, {{as well as}} a combination of other spices, which may include any of anise, angelica root and seed, orris root, licorice root, cinnamon, almond, cubeb, savory, lime peel, grapefruit peel, dragon eye (longan), saffron, baobab, frankincense, coriander, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cassia bark or others. The different combinations and concentrations of these <b>botanicals</b> in the distillation process cause the variations in taste among gin products.|$|E

25|$|This {{includes}} the earliest class of gin, which {{is produced by}} pot distilling a fermented grain mash to moderate strength (e.g. 68% ABV), and then redistilling it with <b>botanicals</b> to extract the aromatic compounds. It must be bottled at a minimum of 30% Alcohol by volume (ABV). Juniper-flavoured spirit drinks may also be sold under the names Wacholder or Genebra.|$|E
25|$|Pot {{distilled}} gin represents the earliest style of gin, and is traditionally produced by pot distilling a fermented grain mash (malt wine) from barley or other grains, then redistilling it with flavouring <b>botanicals</b> {{to extract the}} aromatic compounds. The fermentation of grain mash produces a neutral alcohol (similar to vodka) that is predominately tasteless except for the iconic ethyl alcohol taste. A double gin can be produced by redistilling the first gin again with more <b>botanicals.</b> Due {{to the use of}} pot stills, the alcohol content of the distillate is relatively low; around 68% ABV for a single {{distilled gin}} or 76% ABV for a double gin. This type of gin is often aged in tanks or wooden casks, and retains a heavier, malty flavour that gives it a marked resemblance to whisky. Korenwijn (grain wine) and the oude (old) style of Geneva gin or Holland gin represent the most prominent gins of this class.|$|E
25|$|Distilled gin is {{produced}} exclusively by redistilling ethanol of agricultural origin {{with an initial}} strength of 96% ABV (the azeotrope of water and ethanol) in stills traditionally used for gin, {{in the presence of}} juniper berries and of other natural <b>botanicals,</b> provided that the juniper taste is predominant. Gin obtained simply by adding essences or flavourings to ethanol of agricultural origin is not distilled gin.|$|E

The treatment chapters run to 255 pages in Niedermann’s edition. Meyer lists 262 different plant names in Marcellus; allowing for synonyms, {{of which there}} are many, the number of plants mentioned would be around 131. About 25 of the <b>botanicals</b> most frequently prescribed are “exotica”’ such as galbanum, sagapenum, and ginger; these may have been available in Gaul as imports, but only to elite consumers. Other ingredients likely to have been rare for Marcellus’s intended audience include cinnamon, cloves, candied tragacanth, Alexandrian niter, and African snails, perhaps the Giant African land snail, which are prescribed live for pulping into a mélange. Availability is possibly a lesser criterion of selection for Marcellus than completeness and variety of interest.|$|E
25|$|At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Center for Integrated Agricultural System's Food and Farm {{project is}} working with the region's sustainable-agriculture farmers, processors, distributors, chefs, {{planning}} commissions, and others to define the culinary identity of the region and direct the development of agrotourism. For instance, 75% of the raw-milk artisan cheese produced in Wisconsin is made in the Driftless region. This cheese is made from milk produced by cows that graze on pastures. The region is home to Organic Valley, the nation's largest organic dairy cooperative. Generally, organic dairy production fits best with a grass-based milk production system. In addition to winegrape production and wine-making, the region also is known for apple production, and a number of hard cider makers are about to hit the market with product. The region is historically known for grass-fed beef, and has great potential to market forest <b>botanicals</b> - especially mushrooms - to the 21 million people in the region, including the relatively nearby Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, and Milwaukee markets.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Botanicals,</b> {{so-called}} [...] "natural pesticides", {{are used}} by some farmers {{in an attempt to}} control rice pests. <b>Botanicals</b> include extracts of leaves, or a mulch of the leaves themselves. Some upland rice farmers in Cambodia spread chopped leaves of the bitter bush (Chromolaena odorata) over the surface of fields after planting. This practice probably helps the soil retain moisture and thereby facilitates seed germination. Farmers also claim the leaves are a natural fertilizer and helps suppress weed and insect infestations.|$|E

2500|$|Column {{distilled}} gin evolved following {{the invention of}} the Coffey still, and is produced by first distilling high proof (e.g. 96% ABV) neutral spirits from a fermented mash or wash using a refluxing still such as a column still. The fermentable base for this spirit may be derived from grain, sugar beets, grapes, potatoes, sugar cane, plain sugar, or any other material of agricultural origin. The highly concentrated spirit is then redistilled with juniper berries and other <b>botanicals</b> in a pot still. Most often, the <b>botanicals</b> are suspended in a [...] "gin basket" [...] positioned within the head of the still, which allows the hot alcoholic vapours to extract flavouring components from the botanical charge. This method yields a gin lighter in flavour than the older pot still method, and results in either a {{distilled gin}} or London dry gin, depending largely upon how the spirit is finished.|$|E
2500|$|Absinthe is {{traditionally}} prepared from a distillation of neutral alcohol, various herbs, spices and water.

The principal <b>botanicals</b> are grande wormwood, green anise, and florence fennel, which are often called [...] "the holy trinity."

2500|$|Absinthe ( [...] or French: [...] ) is {{historically}} {{described as a}} distilled, highly alcoholic (45–74% ABV / 90–148 U.S. proof) beverage.

Absinthe traditionally has a natural green colour but may also be colourless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as [...] "" [...] (the green fairy). Although it is sometimes mistakenly {{referred to as a}} liqueur, absinthe is not traditionally bottled with added sugar; it is therefore classified as a spirit. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed.|$|E
