The generation and magnetic confinement of the plasma current requires an electric power {{of several hundred}} MVA for short time periods (up to 10 s). To keep away the pulsed load from the public utility grid, the power and energy is pro-vided by separate networks based on flywheel generators.

40|$|Traditionally, the {{effectiveness}} of a phase overcurrent protection philosophy has been assessed by only considering a fault level versus protection operating time graph (only selectivity). In this research, an improved method was created to evaluate different phase overcurrent protection philosophies for medium-voltage feeders. A focus was placed on reliability, sensitivity, selectivity, speed of operation, performance and minimising risk. The hypothesis stated {{that it is possible to}} develop a method that allows for the evaluation of {{the effectiveness}} of phase overcurrent protection. To test this hypothesis, an application was created that allows for the analysis of an overcurrent protection philosophy. This application made provision for changes in source impedance, evaluation of protection backup contingencies, different conductor types, user-definable protection equipment, the placement of protection equipment, user-definable protection settings, primary plant equipment damage information, user-definable safety margins and source transformer protection information. The application provides graphs that allow the user to evaluate the protection philosophy in terms of the following criteria:  The protection operating time at specific positions in the network. The PU sensitivity of the feeder-installed protection equipment.  The PU sensitivity of the source transformer protection (backup function).  The let-through energy and associated equipment damage criteria.  The energy-area over the analysed path.  To classify the <b>busbar</b> <b>voltage</b> dip.  To determine the position of the fault on the analysed path for the associated <b>busbar</b> <b>voltage</b> dip.  To quantify the occurrence of a specific voltage dip category on the analysed path.

This optimisation includes determining operating time, operating curve selection and the number of auto-reclose attempts. It is possible to determine the preferred protection philosophy using the application. The application does not prescribe how settings are to be calculated, or the placement of the devices; it evaluates if the applied philosophy is protecting the feeder and how well it is protecting it.

40|$|Abstract: most network {{charges are}} based on components’ thermal limits {{providing}} correct economic signals to reinforcing network transformers and lines. However, less attention is drawn to the reinforcement cost driven by nodal voltage limits, particularly those resulting from contingencies. In this work, a new charging approach is proposed in which busbar power perturbation is linked to <b>busbar</b> <b>voltage</b> degradation rate which, in turn, {{is related to the}} incremental investment cost required to maintain voltage levels. The incremental cost results by employing the use of the nodal voltage spare capacity to gauge the time to invest in a reactive power compensation device for a defined load growth rate. The time to invest takes into account the network nodal voltage profiles under N- 1 circuit contingencies (one line outage at a time). Further, the nodal MW and MVAr perturbations are considered in this paper. This novel approach is demonstrated on the IEEE 14 bus network, illustrating the difference in charges when considering contingencies, therefore, providing correct forward-looking economic signals to potential network users. In turn, this will help them make informed decisions as to whether to invest in reactive power compensation assets or pay the network operators for reactive power provision.

This problem proved to be of particular relevance to the EPS in which a source of electrical energy is the generator of wind turbines since the wind itself is an instable primary energy source. Determination {{of the degree of}} automation of voltage regulation in the EPS is reduced to the choice of methods and means of regulation of power quality parameters. The concept of a voltage loss and the causes of the latter are explained by the simplest power system that is presented by a single-line diagram. It is suggested to regulate voltage by means of changing parameters of the network {{with the use of the}} method of reducing loss of line voltage by reducing its reactance. The latter is achieved by longitudinal capacitive compensation of the inductive reactance of the line. The effect is illustrated by vector diagrams of currents and voltages in the equivalent circuits of transmission lines with and without the use of longitudinal capacitive compensation. The analysis of adduced formulas demonstrated that the use of this method of regulation is useful only in the systems of power supply with a relatively low power factor (cosφ < 0. 7 to 0. 9). This power factor is typical for the situation of inclusion the wind turbine with asynchronous generator in the network since the speed of wind is instable.

The price per kWh is important to be competitive with other energy sources. Therefore we try to make solar cells more efficient. Improving solar cell efficiency can be done by optimising the electrode grid pattern. This research relies on existing topology optimisation techniques as used in mechanical problems. By using a finite element formulation of the electrical conductivity we can solve the electrical problem in the grid. Examples show that this is actually working. A large part of this thesis is about the non-linear behaviour of the cell. The way to model this, is discussed and 3 methods are used to compute the nodal currents in the finite element formulation from the current density values. It can be seen that the most accurate way of doing this, is using sample points for the voltages in the element. The objective used in topology optimisation for mechanical problems is adapted for the electrical problem.

Çalışma için örnek olarak toplam iki adet 4 ’lü tren setinin aynı bölgeden kalkış yaptığı durum incelenmiştir. Fakat istenildiği takdirde tren sayısı ve istasyon sayısı rahatlıkla artırılabilir ve bloklar içindeki veriler rahatlıkla değiştirilebilir. İstasyonlar arası mesafe üçüncü ray eşdeğer direnç değeri değiştirilerek rahatlıkla ayarlanabilirken trenler birbiriyle eş olması sebebiyle bir tren bloğu kopyalanarak hatda bulunan toplam tren sayısı da rahatlıkla artırabilir. Böylece tüm hattın modellemesini ve benzetimi yapmak mümkün olacaktır.   Oluşturulan bu model genişletilebilir ve geliştirilebilir olup farklı işletme koşullarının kapsamlı incelemesini gerçekleştirmeye uygundur. Bu incelemede tren kalkış anı karekteristikleri ile birlikte trenlerin çektiği büyük reaktif akımlardan dolayı oluşan harmoniklerin incelemesi yapılmıştır. Tren kalkış anı akım karekteristiklerinin kısa devre hata akımlarına olan benzerliği incelenmiştir. The primary {{function}} of railway traction {{power supply system}} is to provide necessary electrical power to operate the trains in the most efficient and the most cost-effective manner. This is especially important in today urban transportation where passengers cannot even accept minutes of delays. Reliability and availability of traction power supply systems at all the time is the key. Since, traction power supply system is vital for an efficient and reliable railway transport, {{it is important to}} study on modelling and simulation of this system which will enable to study and analyze different operating conditions including short circuit faults and energy quality issues.   A typical traction power supply system has three main subsystems which are power supply system, current collection system and traction drives and motors. The train draws electrical power from the distribution network via suitably spaced substations along the railway line. The electrical power from the substations is transferred to moving trains through a continuous conductor. In the case of overhead current collection system, the power is received from a contact wire that is suspended above track. Pantograph, which is an apparatus mounted {{on the roof of the}} car, is used to collect power through contact wire. In the case of third rail current collection, the power is received from a third rail laid along the side of the track by the help of trainborne collector shoes. In both cases return current usually flows through running rails when only one overhead contact wire or conductor rail is provided. The final part of traction power supply system consists of traction drives and electric motors. Either DC or AC traction motors are used to drive the trains. A 750 V DC traction power supply system, which is in use in Yenikapi-Taksim-Haciosman line of Istanbul Metro, is modelled using Matlab ® Simulink environment. 750 V DC line volatge and third rail current collection systems is used in this metro line. The model is very comprehensive since it consists of all three main systems of traction power supply system. In the developed model, first of all, necessary electrical traction power is received from national high voltage 154 kV network and then converted to 34, 5 kV medium voltage via power transformers. A medium voltage ring system is provided between all substations for the relaiblity of the supply power. This follows by further reducing the voltage by means of rectifier transformers and the reduced AC voltage is finally converted to 750 V DC by means of uncontrolled diode rectifer units. In the developed MATLAB model that is shown by step by step. The third rail current collection system is modelled as equivalent of resistance together with equivalent resistance between the third rail and trainborne collecter shoe. The metro train used in Yenikapi-Taksim-Haciosman metro line consists of 4 -car set. 3 of those 4 -car is motorized cars and each of motorized car consists of 4 traction motor. Thus, the metro train is modelled as total of 12 three-phase squirrel cage induction motor. Traction motor is fed by 3 -phase IGBT units which is controlled by PWM signal.   Only two 4 -car set trains are used in the simulation to study train starting current. It is assummed that two 4 -car train set start running at the same time and in the same zone. However, it is also possible to run the simulation with more trains and thanks to the Simulink environment, the parameters of all blocks can be changed easily. This enable to simulate different scenarios easily. For example, in case of using 8 -car train sets on the track, the two 4 -set car can be coupled easily and connected to any location between the substaions. In the developed model third rail current collection system is modelled as equivalent resistance of 1 km sections. This can be easily changed. A train set can be placed between two adjacent third rail blocks and in that way it will be possible to simulate complete track with desired numbers of trains on the desired location between the stations.   The developed DC metro model can be used in many different applications, however it is the primary objective of this project to use the model in order to study train starting current. It is very important to understand the distinction between train starting currents and the short circuit currents in railway systems since they have similar current magnitude and its rising rate. The phenomena of mis-operation and mal-operation cannot be avoided with the traditional protection. Because problems involved in providing protection to traction systems are very different from those faced in protecting other transmission and distribution lines. This is due to the continous movement of train load, which is in the range of a few MW, change in the lenght of the line during operation and high levels of harmonic currents.   Simulation results are given for both only one train set is running and two train set running at the same time. Third rail voltage, line current, 154 kV <b>busbar</b> <b>voltage</b> and currents, 154 kV busbar energy measurements, IGBT phase-to-phase voltage, tarction motor rotor and stator currents, traction motor voltage, traction motor speed-time graph and electromagnetic torque waveforms are all given in the results. Simulation results pointed out the diffuculty of discrimination remote short circuit current against train starting current. That is because the train starting current even for only one 4 -car train set is more than 4000 A. Train reach that current level in miliseconds. Results also shows that even using only two 4 -car train set 154 kV <b>busbar</b> <b>voltage</b> and current waveforms is not pure sinusoidal because of the excess harmonic currents driven by trains. In the simulation compensation system does not modelled in order to analyze harmonics at 154 kV busbar. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In recent years, a {{new type}} of inverter, the {{multilevel}} voltage source inverter, has become popular in high voltage and high power applications. Multilevel inverters are particularly suitable for harmonic reduction in high power applications where semiconductor devices are not able to operate at high switching frequencies. It is also usual to utilise planar <b>busbars</b> in high <b>voltage</b> multilevel inverters used in the power system environment. If planar busbars are used in conjunction with fast semiconductor switching devices the parasitic inductance of the busbars becomes an important issue. The common problem for conventional hard-switched converters is stray inductance. It is important that this is kept as low as possible to minimise overvoltages. In multilevel inverters there are different loop inductances between busbars and power switches due to different switching states. Results show that the physical layout of the busbars is very important for minimisation of loop inductance in each switch state topology. In addition, the separation of the busbars is limited by the insulation capability between conductors. In this paper, a symmetrical busbar structure is proposed for multilevel converters with diode-clamp and flying-capacitor topologies. The symmetrical structure minimises the variation in stray inductance for different switching states. The overshoot voltage and thermal problems, as mentioned above, are considered for each topology to optimise the planar busbar structure. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} investigates {{reactive power}} compensation and protection of shunt capacitor banks. The characteristics of capacitors including, formulae, design, manufacturing, and testing is presented. Capacitor units using extended foil solder type elements have losses as low as 0. 1 watt/kVAr. Failure of capacitors generally occurs due to overvoltage stress. The type and aging properties of the dielectric determines the lifespan of the capacitor. Polypropylene film is commonly used as the dielectric. Basic capacitor bank design calculations are presented. A detailed discussion on the configurations and protection philosophies is described for single star earthed, single star H-bridge, double star, and C-type filter H-bridge capacitor banks. A novel approach to unbalance voltage detection {{and the protection of}} fuseless single star earthed shunt capacitor banks is investigated, engineered and tested. This methodology explores the potential evolution towards distributed protection. This involves two programmed multifunction protection relays communicating via the IEC 61850 Ethernet protocol. One relay receives voltage measurements from the high <b>voltage</b> <b>busbar.</b> The other relay receives voltage measurements from the low voltage capacitor tap point. The two relays share their measurements via the Ethernet link. The difference in measurements is used to initiate alarm and trip operations. The relay protection function satisfies criterion for reset-ability, selectivity, stability, accuracy, and loss of potential blocking.

40|$|The {{background}} for the project is the 320 MVA generator step-up transformer for Jostedal Power Plant. The transformer experiences excess heating in a limited part of the steel tank and lid from eddy current loss caused by the low <b>voltage</b> <b>busbar</b> configuration. This is unfavorable for the gasket and the transformer oil. In the project a test rig has been constructed which features a mild steel plate, being subjected to a magnetic field. The temperature in the plate is recorded and compared versus a numerical model created in Comsol Multiphysics {{and the use of}} the New Thermometric Method. The non-linear magnetic permeability in mild steel has also been investigated. The heat transfer analysis from the numerical model showed an acceptable temperature deviation compared with the actual temperature in the steel plate. The knowledge from this has been used to create numerical model of a selected part of the transformer utilizing symmetry conditions. The Heat Transfer analysis of this coincides well with thermography images of the overheating area. Poor electromagnetic contact between tank and lid may be an important part of the excess heating in the flange. It is recommended to mount braided copper links over the flange to see if this will reduce some of the excess temperature. If this is not adequate, the evaluation of the different measures that could be done to reduce stray loss concluded that mounting an aluminum shield would be the preferable choice. Mounting such a shield would repel the flux from entering the tank steel, and thereby reduce the temperature. However, the shield itself may experience heating, but not to an extent that the steel experience today. </p...|$|R
