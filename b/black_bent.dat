I had taken a room in London, a large unfurnished room in a big ill-managed lodging-house in a slum near Great Portland Street. The room was soon full of the {{appliances}} I had bought with his money; the work was going on steadily, successfully, drawing near an end. I was like a man emerging from a thicket, and suddenly coming on some unmeaning tragedy. I went to bury him. My mind was still on this research, and I did not lift a finger to save his character. I remember the funeral, the cheap hearse, the scant ceremony, the windy frost-bitten hillside, and the old college friend of his who read the service over him--a shabby, <b>black,</b> <b>bent</b> {{old man with a}} snivelling cold.|$|E

With huge glass mirrors {{on the walls}} to create a feeling of space, visitors are greeted with eagerness and a whiff of baking. The speed of operations is impressive and service quite hassle-free." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 30 mm. The forewings are ochreous yellow, the costal area tinged with rufous towards the base. There is a curved blackish antemedial line, a blackish {{point in the}} upper part of the middle of the cell and a black discoidal bar. The postmedial line is black, forming a slight spot at the costa, bent outwards from vein 5 to above 2, then retracted to below the angle of the cell and excurved below the submedian fold. The hindwings are ochreous yellow with an oblique blackish discoidal bar. The postmedial line is <b>black,</b> <b>bent</b> outwards between veins 5 and 2, then retracted to below the angle of the cell and oblique to above the tornus.|$|E

They did not know what they were rowing: for they only knew they were acting under the orders of their captain, who had just killed nine Rackbirds, and their teeth and their eyes flashed as their oars dipped and bent.|$|R

50|$|The Bull Terrier's most {{recognizable}} feature is its head, described as 'egg-shaped' {{when viewed from}} the front; {{the top of the}} skull is almost flat. The profile curves gently downwards {{from the top of the}} skull to the tip of the nose, which is <b>black</b> and <b>bent</b> downwards at the tip, with well developed nostrils. The under-jaw is deep and strong. The unique triangular eyes are small, dark, and deep-set. Bull Terriers are the only dogs that have triangular eyes. The body is full and round, with strong, muscular shoulders. The tail is carried horizontally. They are either white, red, fawn, black, brindle, or a combination of these.|$|R
60|$|It {{was as if}} some accusing spirit {{had come}} down to bear witness against the deed of blood. Leaning far out of an open window, appear' d a white draperied shape, its face possess'd of a {{wonderful}} youthful beauty. Long vivid glows of lightning gave Philip a full opportunity to see as clearly as though the sun had been shining at noonday. One hand of the figure was raised upward in a deprecating attitude, and his large bright <b>black</b> eyes <b>bent</b> down upon the scene below {{with an expression of}} horror and shrinking pain. Such heavenly looks, and the peculiar circumstance of the time, fill'd Philip's heart with awe.|$|R

In 1879, he was named to the province's Legislative Council. He died in Amherst at the age of 60.|$|R
60|$|And so, when Mister Haggin, or God, or call it {{what one}} will with the {{limitations}} of language, picked Jerry up with imperative abruptness, tucked him under his arm, {{and stepped into the}} whaleboat, whose <b>black</b> crew immediately <b>bent</b> to the oars, Jerry was instantly and nervously aware that the unusual had begun to happen. Never before had he gone out on board the Arangi, which he could see growing larger and closer to each lip-hissing stroke of the oars of the blacks.|$|R
60|$|The negroes {{showed their}} usual art. Paddling westward they rounded the high {{red and white}} South Point, where a {{projecting}} reef broke the rollers. We waited for some twenty minutes for a lull; at the auspicious moment every throat was strained by a screaming shout, and the <b>black</b> backs <b>bent</b> doughtily to their work. We were raised like infants in the nurse's arms; the good craft was flung forward with the seething mass, and as she touched shore we sprang out, whilst our conveyance was beached by a crowd of stragglers. The dreaded bar is as usual double: in the heaviest weather boats make for a solitary palm-tree {{at the bottom of}} the sandy bay. Some of the dug-outs are in pairs like the Brazilian Ajoujo; the sides are lashed together or fastened by thwarts, and both are made to bend a little too much inwards.|$|R
60|$|The hogans {{where these}} desert savages dwelt were all alike; only the chief's was larger. From without it resembled {{a mound of}} clay with a few white logs, half imbedded, shining against the brick red. August Naab drew aside a blanket hanging over a door, and entered, beckoning his {{companion}} to follow. Inured as Hare had become to the smell and smart of wood-smoke, {{for a moment he}} could not see, or scarcely breathe, so thick was the atmosphere. A fire, the size of which attested the desert Indian's love of warmth, blazed {{in the middle of the}} hogan, and sent part of its smoke upward through a round hole in the roof. Eschtah, with blanket over his shoulders, his lean <b>black</b> head <b>bent,</b> sat near the fire. He noted the entrance of his visitors, but immediately resumed his meditative posture, and appeared to be unaware of their presence.|$|R
60|$|As {{the time}} for reading the first psalm approached, you might see the white-headed men turning their faces attentively towards the pulpit; the anxious and {{expectant}} old women, with their little <b>black</b> bonnets, <b>bent</b> forward to see him rise. There were the children looking, because every body else looked; there was Uncle Lot in the front pew, his face considerately adjusted; there was Aunt Sally, seeming as pleased as a mother could seem; and Miss Grace, lifting her sweet face to her brother, like a flower to the sun; there was our friend James in the front gallery, his joyous countenance a little touched with sobriety and expectation; in short, a more embarrassingly attentive audience never greeted the first effort of a young minister. Under these circumstances there was something touching in the fervent self-forgetfulness which characterized the first exercises of the morning--something which moved every one in the house.|$|R
50|$|The Wrackspawn is an undead being. Wrackspawn are created/risen {{from the}} bodies of those fallen in battle, {{tortured}} prisoners, or others who endured extreme pain and bodily damage before death. Wrackspawn are incredibly ugly: bloodstained, charred <b>black</b> muscles; limbs <b>bent</b> in odd directions; a tortured, howling expression; exfoliated from burning; and bones and organs protruding. They are completely mindless, seeking only to kill everyone they see with their bone spears (perhaps made of their own bone) in order to exact morbid revenge on what they may mistake for their tormentors in life. Wrackspawn are far too mindless to speak.|$|R
50|$|The Pike's Peak {{gold rush}} of 1858 led to {{increasing}} conflicts. American miners and settlers gradually encroached on Cheyenne lands until fighting {{broke out in}} 1864. <b>Black</b> Kettle asked <b>Bent</b> to persuade the Americans to negotiate peace and, briefly, it appeared possible. But, Governor John Evans and Colonel John Chivington (who was planning a run for U.S. Congress) had based their political futures on ending the Native American threat. They had amassed troops from Washington, D.C. When Bent, who had lived among the Cheyenne for 40 years and had half-Cheyenne children, asked for peaceful resolution, Chivington {{told him it was}} not possible.|$|R
60|$|The man, {{who did not}} answer, laid {{both hands}} on the reins, for, and he {{recognized}} the significance of it, they swung round a bend of the road into sight of Appleby’s inheritance just then. A pile of harsh brickwork rose in front of them, jarring upon the harmonies of the night; there was a ringing of hammers, and their eyes were dazzled by the glare of a great light under which a swarm of <b>bent</b> <b>black</b> figures were toiling. The horse broke into a gallop, the dog‐cart jolted furiously, and for five anxious minutes Tony, who set his lips, dragged at the reins. Then, as the startled beast was forced into a trot again, he laughed petulantly.|$|R
60|$|Books again! {{all round}} the walls, {{and all over}} the floor--among them a plain deal table, with leaves of {{manuscript}} piled high on every part of it--among the leaves a head of long, elfish white hair covered with a <b>black</b> skull-cap, and <b>bent</b> down over a book--above the head a sallow, withered hand shaking itself at me as a sign that I must not venture to speak just at that moment--on the tops of the bookcases glass vases full of spirits of some kind, with horrible objects floating in the liquid--dirt on the window panes, cobwebs hanging from the ceiling, dust springing up in clouds under my intruding feet. These were the things I observed on first entering the study of Professor Tizzi.|$|R
60|$|Mr. James Turnbull had all {{his life}} professed a {{profound}} interest in physical science, and the phenomena of a good garden were really a pleasure to him; but after three-quarters of {{an hour or so}} even the apostle of science began to find rhododendrus a bore, and was somewhat relieved when an unexpected development of events obliged him to transfer his researches to the equally interesting subject of hollyhocks, which grew some fifty feet farther along the path. The ostensible cause of his removal was the unexpected reappearance of his two other acquaintances walking and talking laboriously along the way, with the <b>black</b> head <b>bent</b> close to the brown one. Even hollyhocks detained Turnbull but a short time. Having rapidly absorbed all the important principles affecting the growth of those vegetables, he jumped over a flower-bed and walked back into the building. The other two came up along the slow course of the path talking and talking. No one but God knows what they said (for they certainly have forgotten), and if I remembered it I would not repeat it. When they parted {{at the head of the}} walk she put out her hand again in the same well-bred way, although it trembled; he seemed to restrain a gesture as he let it fall.|$|R
5000|$|Many years later, {{the detective}} {{hired by the}} Kanes {{presents}} to Commissioner Gordon a dossier describing Martha as a helpless, frail woman hooked on drugs by an abusive husband, who frequently indulged in orgies and extramarital affairs, taking Alfred Pennyworth as her lover. The detective pushes his theory further, disclosing to Gordon a theory about Thomas Wayne ordering the fateful shooting to get revenge over an unfaithful wife and disappearing before being hit by the scandal. The villainous Simon Hurt, head of the <b>Black</b> Glove cabal, <b>bent</b> on getting revenge on Batman, claims to Alfred, taken hostage, to be Thomas Wayne himself, returned to enact his vengeance once again over the unfaithful Martha by ruining her son's life. Alfred disproves this version and questions {{the truth of the}} [...] "revelations" [...] about Thomas Wayne.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 68 mm. The forewings are white, {{with a black}} patch at the base on the costa, covering the inner line. There is a patch of yellow-green scales below it, {{as well as a}} black mark above the inner margin across the inner line with a smaller duplication above vein 1, marked with green scales within. The inner line is narrow, single, <b>black</b> and <b>bent</b> inward toward the base below vein 1. The median line is represented by two grey marks on the costa and there is an orbicular black dot. The reniform is brokenly outlined in black and the outer line is thick and oblique from the costa to vein 5, sending a bar to the outer margin. Beyond the line are a series of patches of green and yellow scales arranged upon a grey strongly waved line, which continues above the oblique black bar to the costa. There is a wavy brown shade in the terminal space and a terminal black line forming dentations of the veins. The hindwings are pale brown, but broadly blackish along the margin, the termen powdered with grey. A black line edged with white powdering stars from near the anal angle. Adults are on wing in January, from March to August and from October to December in Florida.|$|R
50|$|The {{male and}} the female both have tawny-yellow uppersides. The forewing has a {{traverse}} black line below apex cell and an oval spot beyond encircling a small yellow spot, a broad short oblique discal bar and an angulated postdiscal lunular band the costa narrowly and the termen shaded with black. Hindwing: a comparatively large triangular patch below {{the middle of the}} costa, a postdiscal evenly curved series of spots and a broad band along the termen black. Underside dark ochraceous red. Forewing: the base shaded with fuscous black, two spots at base of cell and a transverse line beyond crimson pink, edged with black: a very broad oblique discal band, angulated downwards below vein 4, bordered posteriorly by a large black spot on the inner side and outwardly and anteriorly by an oblique broad black band, followed by four anterior obliquely placed ochraceous-white spots, and beyond by a very narrow lunular <b>black</b> band <b>bent</b> downwards below vein 6. Hindwing: a crimson short line at extreme base, two crimson black-bordered spots in cell: a comparatively broad transverse discal white band often broken up into a large spot below middle of costa, with two or three spots in line below it; finally, a postdiscal series of small black spots. Antennae are black, bright ochraceous at apex; head, thorax and abdomen tawny red above, brown shaded with crimson-pink below.|$|R
60|$|Macheson {{followed}} {{him up the}} stairs and into the heavily carpeted promenade. His memory of the evening, a memory which clung to him for long afterwards, seemed like a phantasmagoria of thrilling music, a stage packed with marvellously dressed women, whose movements were blended with the music into one voluptuous chorus--a blaze of colour not wholly without its artistic significance, and about him an air heavy with tobacco smoke and perfumes, a throng of moving people, more women--many more women. A girl spoke to Holderness,--a girl heavily rouged but not ill-looking, dressed in a blue muslin gown and large <b>black</b> hat. Holderness <b>bent</b> towards her deferentially. His voice seemed to take to itself its utmost note of courtesy, he answered her inquiry pleasantly, and accepted a glance at her programme. The girl looked puzzled, but they talked together for several moments of casual things. Then Holderness lifted his hat.|$|R
50|$|Ollie's suits get {{stained with}} soot, soaked with dirty water, {{and covered in}} flour, until he {{has no choice but}} to go meet his wife at the station in his lodge uniform (a comic version of an Odd Fellows Lodge uniform). Stan {{miraculously}} manages to restore the house's interior to its proper look and decides to light a fire in the fireplace for Ollie and his wife to come home to. When the logs fail to ignite he soaks the fireplace with kerosene, lights a match, and moves it towards the logs. Ollie returns from the train station with a <b>black</b> eye, a <b>bent</b> sword, and without his wife. The house is a smouldering ruin, Stan has burnt it down. Stan leaves Ollie seated on the only remaining chair looking bemused, then to cap it all, a huge rain storm pours down on him.|$|R
5000|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 48 mm. Adults are pale brown, the forewings with a subbasal dark line which is highly angled below the median nervure. There is an antemedial double obliquely curved line slightly widening and filled in with dark brown towards the costa. The area {{between it and}} the subbasal line is darker than the ground colour, with an indistinct waved line on it. There is also a small dark round spot at the middle of the cell, with an indistinct highly crenulate medial line curving round it. There is also a slightly sinuous curved double postmedial line dilated and filled in with dark brown at the costa and there are two indistinct waved submarginal lines, as well as an oblique <b>bent</b> <b>black</b> streak from the apex and a fine dentate black marginal line. The hindwings are fuscous brown, with a dark line through the cilia.|$|R
