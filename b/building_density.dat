5|$|In March 1997 E/R Partners {{settled with}} Aetna, {{receiving}} around $300 million. After {{the legal issues}} were settled E/R Partners announced the building would be dismantled. With {{the announcement of the}} demolition the city dropped its lawsuit against the owners. Unable to implode the building because of the <b>building</b> <b>density</b> of the area, E/R Partners began an eighteen-month, $23 million process to dismantle the building. Early in the process, which began in 1998, the owners hoped someone would buy the property as is or with the damaged portion of the structure removed, but that hope was soon abandoned. The process was finished in 1999. At the time of the demolition it was the third tallest habitable building ever razed and is currently the seventh, ranking after the World Trade Center's twin towers, the Singer Building, and the original Seven World Trade Center in New York, the Morrison Hotel in Chicago, and 130 Liberty Street in New York.|$|E
25|$|The {{commercial}} {{center of}} the city is located on the eastern edge of Lake Cadillac. Most downtown buildings range from two to five stories in height and face the traditional corridor of travel through town, Mitchell Street, the city's tree-lined main street. The downtown contains a movie theater, gift shops, restaurants, a bookstore, specialty food stores, jewelers, clothing retailers and various other businesses. The Courthouse Hill Historic District, established in April 2005, lies adjacent to the city's commercial center. The District contains a number of large Victorian-style residences built by the lumber barons and businessmen who helped establish the city in the 1870s. Population and <b>building</b> <b>density</b> is highest in this area.|$|E
25|$|By {{the second}} half of the 2nd century, Londinium had many large, well-equipped stone buildings, some of which were richly adorned with wall {{paintings}} and floor mosaics, and had subfloor hypocausts. The Roman house at Billingsgate was built next to the waterfront and had its own bath. In addition to such structures reducing the city's <b>building</b> <b>density,</b> however, Londinium also seems to have shrunk in both size and population in {{the second half}} of the 2nd century. The cause is uncertain but plague is considered likely, as the Antonine Plague is recorded decimating other areas of Western Europe between 165 and 190. The end of imperial expansion in Britain after Hadrian's decision to build his wall may have also damaged the city's economy. Although Londinium remained important for the rest of the Roman period, no further expansion occurred. Londinium remained well populated as archaeologists have found that much of the city after this date was covered in dark earth, one that accumulated relatively undisturbed for centuries.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a <b>building’s</b> <b>density</b> on urban flows are {{investigated}} using a CFD model with the RNG k-� turbulence closure scheme. Twenty-seven cases with different <b>building’s</b> <b>density</b> parameters (e. g., building and street-canyon aspect ratios) are numerically simulated. As the <b>building’s</b> <b>density</b> parameters vary, different flow regimes appear. When the street canyon is relatively narrow and high, two counter-rotating vortices in the vertical direction are generated. The wind speed along streets is mainly affected by the building’s length. However, {{it is very difficult}} to find or generalize the characteristics of the street-canyon flows in terms of a single <b>building’s</b> <b>density</b> parameter. This is because the complicated flow patterns appear due to the variation of the vortex structure and vortex number. Volume-averaged vorticity magnitude is a very good indicator to reflect the flow characteristics despite the strong dependency of flows on the variation of the <b>building’s</b> <b>density</b> parameters. Multi-linear regression shows that the volume-averaged vorticity magnitude is a strong function of the building’s length and the street-canyon width. The increase in the building’s length decreases the vorticity of the street-canyon flow, while, the increase in the street-canyon width increases the vorticity...|$|R
40|$|In China, huge {{population}} and limited arable land resources constitute {{one of the}} basic contradictions in urban mass housing design. As a stereotype, medium-rise apartment buildings were constructed to attain high densities all over the country during the 1980 s. The extensive use of the housing typologies caused problems in many aspects. This reflects the poverty of architectural solutions and the consequences of the socio-economic systems of the country. Focusing on the aspects of single building design and site planning, this thesis analyses the methods to reach high <b>building</b> <b>densities</b> in medium-rise mass housing design in Beijing from 1979 to 1990. The study is conducted through the review of the socio-economic issues and the introduction of mass housing design of the country. It intends to see the interrelationships between ways to attain high <b>building</b> <b>densities</b> and the socio-economic backgrounds. The research indicates that methods to reach high <b>building</b> <b>densities</b> are many. Ways used in Beijing during 1980 s were based on the socio-economic system at the time being. These ways are not appropriate in terms of the unique urban context of the city and could be thus replaced by others...|$|R

Development of private forest and range lands also can have landscape-level implications for public lands, if accompanying changes in private forest owner behavior effect changes in ecological conditions and processes and in wildfire. We characterized the spatial distribution of forest and range land development in three regions of eastern Oregon, USA, including the Interior Northwest Landscape Analysis System (INLAS) study area, to facilitate examining forest and fuel management alternatives to address wildfire and other forest health issues. We developed empirical models describing the spatial distribution of buildings {{and the construction of}} new buildings in each region, as a function of population, existing <b>building</b> <b>densities,</b> slope, elevation, and land-use zoning. We used the empirical models to create geographic information system maps of predicted future <b>building</b> <b>densities</b> on forest and range lands to support vegetation, wildfire, and terrestrial and aquatic habitat analyses. Model predictions suggest that future forest and range land development could be relatively limited within the INLAS study area. The results raise conceptual and methodological questions about how best to anticipate future development in rural locations beyond examining and projecting historical trends alone.

30|$|The urban context {{consists}} of continuous, compact and intensively built territory: it {{is characterized by}} different <b>building</b> <b>densities,</b> construction typologies and forms and {{by the presence of}} buildings for different functions, including those for significant industrial and manufacturing activities and public services for the population.

The open and empty spaces are completely negligible compared to the constructed spaces. The changes relate primarily to relevant transformations and conversions of abandoned industrial areas. The relationship between natural and anthropogenic factors is characterized by maximum values of urbanization, sealing soils, and artificialization of water bodies.|$|R
