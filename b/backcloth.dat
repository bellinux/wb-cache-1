The sons created a memorial to their parents in St Erasmus' Chapel in Chester cathedral. This consists of a <b>backcloth</b> to the altar inscribed to their parents' memory, and a bust of their father {{to the north of}} the altar. The memorial is by Sir Arthur Blomfield and the bust by M. Wagmiller. There is also a bust of Thomas in Chester's Grosvenor Museum and plaques to his memory in Chester station. Streets named after him in Chester are Brassey Street and Thomas Brassey Close (which is off Lightfoot Street).|$|E
5|$|Except for his juvenilia, {{little of}} which has survived, Mahler {{composed}} only in the media of song and symphony, with a close and complex interrelationship between the two. Donald Mitchell writes that this interaction is the <b>backcloth</b> against which all Mahler's music can be considered. The initial connection between song and symphony occurs with the song-cycle Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen and the First Symphony. Although this early evidence of cross-fertilisation is important, it is during Mahler's extended Wunderhorn phase, in which his Second, Third and Fourth Symphonies were written, that the song and symphony genres are consistently intermingled. Themes from the Wunderhorn song Das himmlische Leben ("The Heavenly Life"), composed in 1892, became {{a key element in}} the Third Symphony completed in 1896; the song itself forms the finale to the Fourth (1900) and its melody is central to the whole composition. For the Second Symphony, written between 1888 and 1894, Mahler worked simultaneously on the Wunderhorn song, Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt ("The Sermon of St Anthony of Padua to the Fishes"), and on the Scherzo based on it which became the symphony's third movement. Another Wunderhorn setting from 1892, Urlicht ("Primal Light"), is used as the Second Symphony's fourth (penultimate) movement.|$|E

He has painted <b>backcloths</b> up to 400 square meters in size. He has also painted trompe l'oeil images for private houses and public buildings. In 1990, he developed a body painting technique, and his work has been used in advertising images and commercials, as well as fashion events and exhibitions.|$|R
25|$|Among Fontana’s last {{works are}} {{a series of}} Teatrini (‘little theatres’), in which he {{returned}} to an essentially flat idiom by using <b>backcloths</b> enclosed within wings resembling a frame; the reference to theatre emphasizes the act of looking, while in the foreground a series of irregular spheres or oscillating, wavy silhouettes creates a lively shadow play. Another work from that time, Trinità (Trinity) (1966), consists of three large white canvases punctuated by lines of holes, embraced in a theatrical setting made from ultramarine plastic sheets vaguely resembling wings.|$|R
60|$|But {{why was he}} intruded? you ask. Why {{could not}} a modern Utopia be {{discussed}} without this impersonation--impersonally? It has confused the book, you say, made the argument hard to follow, and thrown a quality of insincerity over the whole. Are we but mocking at Utopias, you demand, using all these noble and generalised hopes as the <b>backcloth</b> against which two bickering personalities jar and squabble? Do I mean we are never to view the promised land again except through a foreground of fellow-travellers? There is a common notion that the reading of a Utopia should end with a swelling heart and clear resolves, with lists of names, formation of committees, and even the commencement of subscriptions. But this Utopia began upon a philosophy of fragmentation, and ends, confusedly, amidst a gross tumult of immediate realities, in dust and doubt, with, at the best, one individual's aspiration. Utopias were once in good faith, projects for a fresh creation {{of the world and}} of a most unworldly completeness; this so-called Modern Utopia is a mere story of personal adventures among Utopian philosophies.|$|E
6000|$|The MARCH'S dining-room opens through French {{windows on}} one of those [...] gardens which seem infinite, till they are seen to be coterminous [...] with the side walls of the house, and finite at the far end, because [...] only the thick screen of acacias and sumachs {{prevents}} another house [...] from being seen. The French and other windows form practically all [...] the outer wall of that dining-room, and between them and the screen [...] of trees lies the difference between the characters of Mr and Mrs [...] March, with dots and dashes of Mary and Johnny thrown in. For [...] instance, it has been formalised by MRS MARCH but the grass has not [...] been cut by MR MARCH, and daffodils have sprung up there, which MRS [...] MARCH desires for the dining-room, but of which MR MARCH says: [...] "For [...] God's sake, Joan, let them grow." [...] About half therefore are now in a [...] bowl on the breakfast table, and the other half still in the grass, [...] in the compromise essential to lasting domesticity. A hammock under [...] the acacias shows that MARY lies there sometimes with her eyes on [...] the gleam of sunlight that comes through: and a trail in the longish [...] grass, bordered with cigarette ends, proves that JOHNNY tramps there [...] with his eyes on the ground or the stars, according. But all this [...] is by the way, because except for a yard or two of gravel terrace [...] outside the windows, it is all painted on the <b>backcloth.</b> The [...] MARCHES have been at breakfast, and the round table, covered with [...] blue linen, is thick with remains, seven baskets full. The room is [...] gifted with old oak furniture: there is a door, stage Left, Forward; [...] a hearth, where a fire is burning, and a high fender on which one [...] can sit, stage Right, Middle; and in the wall below the fireplace, [...] a service hatch covered with a sliding shutter, for the passage of [...] dishes into the adjoining pantry. Against the wall, stage Left, is [...] an old oak dresser, and a small writing table across the Left Back [...] corner. MRS MARCH still sits behind the coffee pot, making up her [...] daily list on tablets with a little gold pencil fastened to her [...] wrist. She is personable, forty-eight, trim, well-dressed, and more [...] matter-of-fact than seems plausible. MR MARCH is sitting in an [...] armchair, sideways to the windows, smoking his pipe and reading his [...] newspaper, with little explosions to which no one pays any [...] attention, because it is his daily habit. He is a fine-looking man [...] of fifty odd, with red-grey moustaches and hair, both of which [...] stiver partly by nature and partly because his hands often push them [...] up. MARY and JOHNNY are close to the fireplace, stage Right. [...] JOHNNY sits on the fender, smoking a cigarette and warming his back. [...] He is a commonplace looking young man, with a decided jaw, tall, [...] neat, soulful, who has been in the war and writes poetry. MARY is [...] less ordinary; you cannot tell exactly what is the matter with her. [...] She too is tall, a little absent, fair, and well-looking. She has a [...] small china dog in her hand, taken from the mantelpiece, and faces [...] the audience. As the curtain rises she is saying in her soft and [...] pleasant voice: [...] "Well, what is the matter with us all, Johnny?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{left in a}} French steamer, and {{she called}} in every blamed port they have out there, for, as far as I could see, {{the sole purpose of}} landing {{soldiers}} and custom-house officers. I watched the coast. Watching a coast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma. There it is before you--smiling, frowning, inviting, grand, mean, insipid, or savage, and always mute with an air of whispering, 'Come and find out.' This one was almost featureless, as if still in the making, with an aspect of monotonous grimness. The edge of a colossal jungle, so dark-green as to be almost black, fringed with white surf, ran straight, like a ruled line, far, far away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a creeping mist. The sun was fierce, the land seemed to glisten and drip with steam. Here and there grayish-whitish specks showed up, clustered inside the white surf, with a flag flying above them perhaps. Settlements some centuries old, and still no bigger than pin-heads on the untouched expanse of their background. We pounded along, stopped, landed soldiers; went on, landed custom-house clerks to levy toll in what looked like a God-forsaken wilderness, with a tin shed and a flag-pole lost in it; landed more soldiers--to take care of the custom-house clerks, presumably. Some, I heard, got drowned in the surf; but whether they did or not, nobody seemed particularly to care. They were just flung out there, and on we went. Every day the coast looked the same, as though we had not moved; but we passed various places--trading places--with names like Gran' Bassam Little Popo, names that seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister <b>backcloth.</b> The idleness of a passenger, my isolation amongst all these men with whom I had no point of contact, the oily and languid sea, the uniform somberness of the coast, seemed to keep me away from the truth of things, within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion. The voice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure, like the speech of a brother. It was something natural, that had its reason, that had a meaning. Now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary contact with reality. It was paddled by black fellows. You could see from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening. They shouted, sang; their bodies streamed with perspiration; they had faces like grotesque masks--these chaps; but they had bone, muscle, a wild vitality, an intense energy of movement, that was as natural and true as the surf along their coast. They wanted no excuse for being there. They were a great comfort to look at. For a time I would feel I belonged still to a world of straightforward facts; but the feeling would not last long. Something would turn up to scare it away. Once, I remember, we came upon a man-of-war anchored off the coast. There wasn't even a shed there, and she was shelling the bush. It appears the French had one of their wars going on thereabouts. Her ensign dropped limp like a rag; the muzzles of the long eight-inch guns stuck out all over the low hull; the greasy, slimy swell swung her up lazily and let her down, swaying her thin masts. In the empty immensity of earth, sky, and water, there she was, incomprehensible, firing into a continent. Pop, would go one of the eight-inch guns; a small flame would dart and vanish, a little white smoke would disappear, a tiny projectile would give a feeble screech--and nothing happened. Nothing could happen. There was a touch of insanity in the proceeding, a sense of lugubrious drollery in the sight; and it was not dissipated by somebody on board assuring me earnestly there was a camp of natives--he called them enemies!--hidden out of sight somewhere.|$|E
5000|$|The masque saw Jones's {{introduction}} of two techniques of scenery construction to English stagecraft. [...] "Sidewings" [...] are pieces of painted canvas that stand {{along the sides}} of the stage, resembling partial backdrops; they can be deployed in multiple pairs arranged for perspective effects. [...] "Shutters" [...] are painted <b>backcloths</b> split down the center, that can be slid in or out from the wings. Shutters, like sidewings, can be deployed in multiple sets; their use allows varied changes of scenic backdrop. (Such scenery was used in masques during the Stuart era; considerations of cost and practicality generally kept scenery out of the professional theatre of Shakespeare and his successors until the Restoration period.) ...|$|R
50|$|Another way {{in which}} Bergman reminds the viewer that the film is a {{theatrical}} event is to display openly the mechanical stagecraft of the 18th century theater. The scenery of the time could hardly vie in realism with modern-day effects, but it was fluid and swiftly changeable. Thus when the Queen of the Night first arrives, day turns to night as we witness the shifting <b>backcloths</b> moving to create the new scene. Similarly, when Papagena and Papageno joyously discover {{each other in a}} winter landscape, the chiming of the magic bells quickly changes the scenery from Winter into Spring while the two characters remove each other's winter garments. The arrival of the Three Boys by descent in a charmingly decorated 18th-century hot-air balloon represents a faithful reflection by Bergman of Schikaneder's original libretto; Schikaneder's theater abounded in mechanical devices of this kind.|$|R
30|$|Whilst {{the number}} of {{different}} types of plants recorded as being used to provide differing colours is large and varied [3] the literature on the analysis of the various types of dyes found to be present in <b>backcloths</b> remains narrow [4, 5]. A comprehensive review on the materials used in barkcloth production by Larson [6] listed only a few sources of plant colorants and inorganic pigments as commonly used. There has been very little scientific analysis carried out on the colourants on these cloths excepting work by Bisulca et al. [4] and the published literature on the materials used and their manufacture for the most part comes from historic accounts of early missionaries or explorers. Research carried out to determine the colorants used on Hawaiian barkcloth noted that there are over 10 plant species documented as historic red dyestuffs, however from the barkcloth pieces analysed for red colouring all came from noni (Morinda citrifolia). In cases where the red design was not organic, the red colourant was found to be an iron oxide pigment [4].|$|R

5000|$|... “Target or victim <b>backcloth</b> is {{important}} for {{an understanding of the}} geometric arrangement of crime sites; it is the equivalent of the spatial opportunity structure (Brantingham & Brantigham, 1993b). It is configured by both geographic and temporal distribution of “suitable” (as seen from the offenders perspective) crime targets or victims across the physical landscape. The availability of particular targets may vary significantly according to neighborhood, area, or even city, and is influenced by time, day of week, and season; hence, the term structural <b>backcloth</b> is also used.” ...|$|E

40|$|From a {{structural}} standpoint, living organisms are organized like {{a nest of}} Russian matryoshka dolls, in which structures are buried within one another. From a temporal point of view, this type of organization {{is the result of}} a history comprised of a set of time <b>backcloths</b> which have accompanied the passage of living matter from its origins up to the present day. The aim of the present paper is to indicate a possible course of this ‘passage through time, and suggest how today’s complexity has been reached by living organisms. This investigation will employ three conceptual tools, namely the Mosaic, Self-Similarity Logic, and the Biological Attraction principles. Self-Similarity Logic indicates the self-consistency by which elements of a living system interact, irrespective of the spatiotemporal level under consideration. The term Mosaic indicates how, from the same set of elements assembled according to different patterns, it is possible to arrive at completely different constructions: hence, each system becomes endowed with different emergent properties. The Biological Attraction principle states that there is an inherent drive for association and merging of compatible elements at all levels of biological complexity. By analogy with the gravitation law in physics, biological attraction is based on the evidence that each living organism creates an attractive field around itself. This field acts as a sphere of influence that actively attracts similar fields of other biological systems, thereby modifying salient features of the interacting organisms. Three specific organizational levels of living matter, namely the molecular, cellular, and supracellular levels, have been considered in order to analyse and illustrate the interpretative as well as the predictive roles of each of these three explanatory principles...|$|R
