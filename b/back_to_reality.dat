While Cobb remains in Limbo to search for Saito, the other team members ride the synchronized kicks <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reality.</b> Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo and reminds him of their agreement.

25|$|In Pride's first book, The Way Home: Beyond Feminism, <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Reality,</b> she chronicled {{her journey}} {{away from what}} she argued were feminist and anti-natal ideas of happiness, within which she had lived as an activist before her {{conversion}} to conservative evangelical Christianity in 1977. She described her discovery of happiness surrounding what she felt was the Biblically mandated role of wives and mothers as bearers of children and workers in the home {{under the authority of}} a husband. Pride argued that such a lifestyle was Biblically required of married Christian women but that most had been unknowingly duped by feminism. She meanwhile countered in the book various versions of Christian feminism.|$|E
25|$|After {{the group}} reels with shock and grief, Rick tells a heartbroken Maggie, still {{suffering}} from pregnancy complications, {{that they need}} to get her to the Hilltop Colony's doctor. However, Maggie insists they all head back to Alexandria and prepare to fight. Rick counters, saying they will all die if they go after Negan and his army. The group insist on continuing to the Hilltop, but Maggie demands they do not follow her. Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) volunteers to escort Maggie to the Hilltop to recover, along with the bodies of Glenn and Abraham. As a walker slowly approaches, Rick picks up his axe and joins the others in the RV. Saddened, Rick has a vision of his entire group, including Abraham and Glenn as well as Maggie's yet-born child, enjoying a peaceful outdoor meal together in Alexandria, before coming <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reality.</b> Through the right hand side view-mirror, Rick sees the walker eating the leftover blood remains of Glenn as he drives away.|$|E

500|$|Marco's {{realization}} that Mulberry Street intersects with Bliss Street {{leads him to}} imagine a group of police escorts. The scene becomes a parade, as he then imagines a grand stand filled with the mayor and aldermen; an airplane dropping confetti; and, in the final incarnation of the scene, a Chinese man, a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat, and {{a man with a}} ten-foot beard. Now almost home, he snaps <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reality</b> and rushes up the front steps, eager to tell his father his imagined story. However, when his father questions him about what he saw on his way home, his face turns red and he says, [...] "Nothing...but a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street." ...|$|E
500|$|Different {{styles of}} {{background}} music {{were used to}} convey certain things. For example, a guitar is played when Ishaan is tense or upset, sometimes with discordant notes. The music of the opening scene—the recurring [...] "Ishaan's Theme," [...] which represents the character's peace of mind—overpowers the background noise to show that Ishaan is lost in his own world; the noise becomes louder after he snaps <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reality.</b> But the scene in which Nikumbh explains dyslexia to Ishaan's family took the opposite approach. Silent at first, the music is slowly introduced as the father begins to understand his son's dilemma. The almost seven-minute long scene scarcely used any background music, to slow the pace and make it seem more realistic.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was filmed in May 2008 and {{directed}} by Wayne Isham. It premiered on 16 September 2008. It starts out with Lewis receiving a text message from her boyfriend saying he is just a minute away from meeting up with her. The video then turns into a dream-like sequence with Lewis dancing in four set-ups inspired by the Hollywood musicals West Side Story, The Rocky Horror Show, Singin' in the Rain and Carousel. The video ends with Lewis coming <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reality</b> after a drop of rain lands on her hand and her boyfriend sent a message saying [...] "Hurry! Looks like there could be rain". The Jabbawockeez dance crew also make an appearance in the Rocky Horror scene in the video, dancing behind Lewis.|$|E
6000|$|The second act, a [...] "dream act" [...] {{was not so}} good, but {{the play}} came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>realities</b> in the last act and sent us all away in joyous mood.

500|$|The {{film was}} also a {{deliberate}} effort to bring the series more <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reality,</b> following the success of Moonraker in 1979. As co-writer Michael G. Wilson pointed out, [...] "If {{we went through the}} path of Moonraker things would just get more outlandish, so we needed to get back to basics". To that end, the story that emerged was simpler, not one in which the world was at risk, but returning the series to that of a Cold War thriller; Bond would also rely more on his wits than gadgets to survive. Glen decided to symbolically represent it with a scene where Bond's Lotus blows itself up and forces 007 to rely on Melina's more humble Citroën 2CV. Since Ken Adam was busy with Pennies from Heaven, Peter Lamont, who had worked in the art department since Goldfinger, was promoted to production designer. Following a suggestion of Glen, Lamont created realistic scenery, instead of the elaborate set pieces for which the series had been known.|$|E
500|$|Michael Azerrad {{argued in}} his Nirvana {{biography}} [...] (1993) that Nevermind marked an epochal generational shift in music {{similar to the}} rock-and-roll explosion in the 1950s {{and the end of}} the baby boomer generation's dominance of the musical landscape. Azerrad wrote, [...] "Nevermind came along at exactly the right time. This was music by, for, and about a whole new group of young people who had been overlooked, ignored, or condescended to." [...] In its citation placing it at number 17 in its 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, Rolling Stone said, [...] "No album in recent history had such an overpowering impact on a generation—a nation of teens suddenly turned punk—and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator." [...] Gary Gersh, who signed Nirvana to Geffen Records, added that [...] "There is a pre-Nirvana and post-Nirvana record business...'Nevermind' showed that this wasn't some alternative thing happening off in a corner, and then <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reality.</b> This is reality." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{not ideal}} for transcontinental travel, Iowa's dirt roads were of high quality. [...] Foreigners even {{compared}} {{them to the}} best roads in France. [...] However, the same could not be said when they were wet. [...] The mud was so thick and viscous it was nicknamed [...] "". [...] To show travelers the obvious benefits of paved roads, the Lincoln Highway Association began {{the process of creating}} seedling miles of paved roads. [...] The idea, according to Henry B. Joy, then-president of the Lincoln Highway Association, was to show travelers, for , how fast and smooth their trip could be, only to bring them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reality</b> {{at the end of the}} mile. [...] Seedling miles were placed at least [...] from the nearest town and in areas where the terrain was rough. [...] Between August 1918 and June 1919, Iowa's first seedling mile was built in Linn County, west of Mount Vernon. [...] The ribbon of concrete, which was [...] wide, [...] thick, and crowned for drainage , cost nearly $35,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] dollars) to build.|$|E

The show was wildly successful with over 40 million viewers in the US tuning into the season one finale.|$|R

500|$|Ned reluctantly {{agrees with}} this and asks Homer to teach him the secret to his lust for life. This leads Homer to head towards Mr. Burns' Casino, but when Ned reminds Homer it is now defunct, Homer instead takes Ned on a {{gambling}} trip to Las Vegas. Homer is confident about going there, but Flanders is nervous. When they arrive, they see Captain Lance Murdock (from [...] "Bart the Daredevil") doing one of his stunts, and Homer chooses to volunteer, and survives (although Murdock is again badly injured). They wander into a casino called [...] "Nero's Palace" [...] and begin to play roulette. Ned protests against games of chance because of Deuteronomy 7, but Homer ignores him and takes the reference as a lucky number. They win, but immediately lose all they won. They {{then go to the}} casino's bar, and Ned gives into temptation and gets drunk on wine spritzers. Homer and Ned wake up the next morning in their hotel room married to two cocktail waitresses: Homer's new wife is named Amber, and Ned's new wife is Ginger. Homer finally realizes he got in over his head. While Homer fantasizes about bigamy, Ned snaps Homer <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reality</b> by saying they were drunk and thus not of sound judgement to have such quickie, plastic weddings; also they are already married.|$|E
500|$|When New Directions starts {{planning}} a setlist for the impending Nationals competition, Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) is frustrated that Rachel (Lea Michele) is again singing lead while she remains {{stuck in the}} background, and walks out. When Rachel tries to bribe her to withdraw her objections, she tells Rachel {{that she wants to}} experience a standing ovation of her own. Tina later falls into a fountain and strikes her head, which causes her to experience a vision in which all of the glee club members have switched roles,—most notably, she sees herself as Rachel and Rachel as Tina. [...] "Rachel" [...] performs [...] "Because You Loved Me", and the club gives her a standing ovation. She thanks [...] "Tina" [...] for her support, and [...] "Tina" [...] in turn gives [...] "Rachel" [...] advice on how to salvage her failed NYADA audition. After Tina comes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reality,</b> she conveys that advice: Rachel should see NYADA dean Carmen Tibideaux (Whoopi Goldberg) in person—she is conducting a master class at Oberlin. Tina drives Rachel there, but Carmen has been annoyed by Rachel's repeated messages and says she does not deserve any special attention. Tina disagrees, telling Carmen that although Rachel gets whatever she wants and is [...] "a pain in the ass", Rachel gets it all because she is exceptional. Rachel invites Carmen to attend their Nationals performance, and pledges to audition for NYADA every year until she is accepted.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "My Heart Is Broken" [...] {{was directed by}} Dean Karr. Filming commenced on December 1, 2011 in Los Angeles. During an interview with MTV News, Lee stated that the visual was [...] "ethereal", also saying that [...] "this [...] {{is going to look}} a lot different. Actually, I kind of wanted it to be the opposite. The first video, for 'What You Want,' was very real, and this is very surreal." [...] The singer further confessed that the clip draws inspiration from dark fantasy horror film Paperhouse (1988) in order to achieve surreality. Lee further explained, [...] " [...] this girl, and everything that she would draw would come to life in her dreams, and she was creating this dream world for herself. And at first, it was cool, but then it's like this nightmare. So I sort of thought it would apply, and be cool, to have it be this dream that you're trapped in. So you're in a place that, at first, is a magical world, but at the same time, you're isolated and trapped there, and that's the reason you want to come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reality</b> after a time." [...] When filming the video, fiber optics were used reportedly in order to create the effect of things coming to life after drawing them. Lee described the appearance {{of the rest of the}} group in the visual as [...] "sort of like the dream within the dream, in an abyss of darkness".|$|E

500|$|Much of Ianto's {{character}} development is centred on the character's relationship with Captain Jack. On the character's evolution from minor character to romantic interest, Gareth David-Lloyd has commented that [...] "To have a storyline where you're {{involved with the}} leading character for any actor is awesome." [...] On the character's development, David-Lloyd has said that through Jack's relationship, [...] "he's found his meaning and ... he's happier." [...] Asked {{what it is that}} Ianto receives from Jack, David-Lloyd responds [...] "Support, meaning. I think he lost meaning. He was tortured and Jack gave him that meaning back. And reliability that he'll always be there, I think." [...] John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd have also opined that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him, with John Barrowman reported as saying that Ianto [...] "brings out the 'human' in him, it brings out more of the empathy because he's actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody. So, it's really great and I think that's what makes him warm to other people. It makes him more approachable." [...] In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that [...] "I think Ianto's always made him care and that is really the heart of the show. Ianto's always bearing his emotional side and vulnerable side and keeping his feet on the ground. I think of all the characters, he's the one who tries to keep everyone else's feet on the ground. He brings everyone <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reality,</b> often with a dry, witty remark or taking a dig at somebody just to sort of bring people back down." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "We Need To Talk About Kevin", Dean escapes Purgatory {{with the}} help of the vampire Benny, but Castiel is not with him. He later tells Sam that things got hairy near the end and that Castiel didn't make it, that he [...] "let go". While Dean doesn't elaborate, he is clearly {{affected}} by this. In a flashback scene, Dean is shown looking for Castiel in Purgatory, interrogating a vampire for his location. As a result, he meets Benny and only agrees to Benny's deal to get out if they find Castiel first and help him escape too. Castiel appears in flashbacks in the following episode, where he reveals that he fled Dean to keep him safe from the Leviathans and other monsters that are angry at Castiel, but Dean refuses to leave Purgatory without Castiel. When talking with another angel at an auction for the second Word of God tablet, Dean again states that Castiel did not make it out of Purgatory. He later escapes with the aid of an army of angels sent to rescue him – having initially remained behind as penance for his actions to stop a duo of Leviathans that were trying to attack Dean and Benny as they left Purgatory – but the other angels not only erase his memory that they were responsible for his escape, but also erase his memory of their subsequent 'check-ins' to discuss the Winchesters' actions, with Castiel forced to tell them about the Winchesters' progress in the search for the tablet. Apparently back to full power, Castiel helps the Winchesters save Kevin from Crowley – who has been abducting future Prophets to try to find another means of reading the Word of God tablet – and destroy the tablet to prevent Crowley using it, retaining half of the tablet while Crowley flees with the other half. Afterwards, in [...] "Hunteri Heroici", Castiel cuts off his ability to listen into the other angels and decides to become a full-time hunter to avoid facing the other angels about what he has done. Castiel proves instrumental in solving the case, using his abilities to enter the mind of a man with reality warping powers, allowing Sam to bring him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>reality</b> with a speech about not running from it. Later, at the request of the man, Fred, Castiel strips him of his powers so he is no longer a danger to anyone though it leaves him mentally damaged. Castiel, having listened to Sam's speech about running from reality as well as Fred, decides to return to Heaven to try to make up for what he did, but is forbidden by Naomi, the angel who ordered his rescue. Instead, Castiel stays to watch out for Fred for a while, but accepts that he can no longer run from what he has done.|$|E
