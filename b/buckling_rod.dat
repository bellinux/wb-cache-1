40|$|In this thesis, {{problems}} of structural optimisation are approached through analytic and computational techniques. A particular focus {{is the effect}} of hierarchical design. The first chapter forms an introduction for the reader. Chapter 2 investigates the optimisation of elastic support on a <b>buckling</b> <b>rod.</b> A cost function is associated with the strength of the total elastic support provided to a beam of uniform cross-section supporting a compressive load. Through a perturbative method, it is found that for a low cost of support, a single, centrally placed support is optimal; furthermore it is found, using simulational and analytic methods, that the optimal support placement undergoes a series of bifurcations as the cost increases. The nature of these bifurcations is non-trivial and, although the analogy is not complete, there exist similarities between the solution to this problem and Landau theory of second-order phase transitions. In Chapter 3, the theme of hierarchical design is introduced. By analysing all possible failure modes, it is shown that a hierarchical design is highly efficient for withstanding external pressure loading in the limit of low applied pressures. By changing the level of hierarchy, the scaling law for volume of material required for structural stability against the applied external pressure can be changed systematically. For a given applied pressure, a particular level of hierarchy is shown to be optimal. This optimal level of hierarchy increases without bound as the pressure decreases. The Hausdorff dimension of the optimal structure and its dependence on applied pressure is found. Two example structures are presented, although the design is applicable to any convex shape. The fourth chapter of this thesis investigates the use of hierarchical geometry for a highly efficient interface between two surfaces. It is proposed that for a given strength of surface interaction, alterations to the geometry of the interface play a strong role in determining the force that is required to separate the surfaces. In particular the case of two surfaces with one being very much more rigid than the second is investigated. Increasing the hierarchical order of the design is seen to change the scaling relationship between the interface interaction strength and failure load. In Chapter 5, a hierarchical design for high mechanical efficiency under compressive loading is fabricated and mechanically tested. The particular design has previously been shown to be highly efficient under compressive loading. The scaling of material required to build a stable structure against a specific loading has previously been shown to be dependent on the level of hierarchy. A second order design is fabricated using rapid prototyping techniques. Additionally, a similar design based on hollow tubes rather than solid beams is proposed and is shown to make further savings on volume when compared to the original design. The final investigation presented in this thesis focuses on the role of imperfections in determining the buckling load of a hierarchical design. A two-dimensional design is proposed before simple, single beam, imperfections are added to the structure. The dependence of the structure on the magnitude of the imperfections is calculated analytically for the generation- 1 and 2 designs. In the generation- 1 structure, the magnitude of the imperfection is related to the reduction in failure load by a one-half power-law. The behaviour of a generation- 2 frame with a single beam perturbed in thickness is found to be dominated by the behaviour of the generation- 1 subframe. The behaviour found analytically is confirmed with finite element simulations for the generation- 1 structure...|$|E

We study the helical morphology as the modulus of the upper gel layer is varied and demonstrate {{that the size of}} the deformation varies with gel stiffness as expected by a mathematical model based on the theory of <b>buckled</b> <b>rods.</b> Moreover, we show that plant-to-plant variations can be accounted for by biomechanically plausible values of the model parameters...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} demonstrated that an axially loaded weightless circular <b>rod</b> <b>buckles</b> helically when constrained within a circular cylinder. The effects of pinned and fixed end conditions {{on the behavior of}} such a helically <b>buckled</b> <b>rod</b> are investigated. Both end conditions locate the rod end on the cylinder axis. The pinned end condition considers the rod end free to rotate about all three axes, allows axial translation, and prevents radial movement. The fixed end condition allows axial rotation and translation, requires the rod end to be tangent to the cylinder axis, and prevents radial movement. Both end conditions are found to perturb the helix in an exponentially decaying manner for a distance of less than one pitch length. Far from the end, the rod behaves as an undisturbed constant-pitch helix. The distance from the rod end to the point of initial contact with the cylinder wall is calculated. Closed form analytical solutions are obtained for the deflected shapes and internal reactions of the end sections. The maximum internal bending moment for the pinned-end case is 19. 5 % higher in the end section than in the helical section. The maximum bending moment for the fixed-end case also occurs in the end section and is 1 % higher than in the helical section. The solution procedure applies to rods of either finite or infinite length. Experimental results confirm the analytical findings...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we study {{the effect of}} {{extensibility}} on the vibration characteristics of a spatial <b>buckled</b> <b>rod</b> (elastica) under edge thrust and supported by spherical hinges at the ends. The nonlinear equations of motion are written {{within the framework of}} director theory. The elastica in question admits only plane deformations. There are three types of vibration modes, in-plane, symmetric out-of-plane, and anti-symmetric (twisting) out-of-plane. Most of the natural frequencies decrease as the end shortening increases, except the first in-plane mode without a nodal point. This mode is inadmissible in an inextensible elastica. This may be considered a flaw in the inextensible elastica model when dynamic behavior is concerned. In the limit case when the static deformation is small, a small-deformation theory taking into account axial extensibility is formulated and compared with the elastica model. The natural frequency of the first in-plane mode derived from small-deformation theory agrees very well with the one calculated from the extensible elastica model in the post-buckling range. However, all others are found to be independent of end shortening. This obviously unreasonable result is due to the limitation of small-deformation theory...|$|R

40|$|The {{classical}} {{problem of}} the buckling of an elastic rod in a magnetic ¯eld is investigated using modern techniques from dynamical systems theory. The Kirchhoff equations, which describe the static equilibrium equations of a geometrically exact rod under end tension and moment are extended by incorporating {{the evolution of a}} fixed external vector (in the direction of the magnetic field) that interacts with the rod via a Lorentz force. The static equilibrium equations (in body cordinates) are found to be noncanonical Hamiltonian equations. The Poisson bracket is generalised and the equilibrium equations found to sit, as the third member, in a family of rod equations in generalised magnetic fields. When the rod is linearly elastic, isotropic, inextensible and unshearable the equations are completely integrable and can be generated by a Lax pair. The isotropic system is reduced using the Casimirs, via the Euler angles, to a four-dimensional canonical system with a first integral provided the magnetic field is not aligned with the force within the rod at any point as the system losses rank. An energy surface is specified, defning three-dimensional flows. Poincare sections then show closed curves. Through Mel'nikov analysis it is shown that for an extensible rod the presence of a magnetic field leads to the transverse intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds and the loss of complete integrability. Consequently, the system admits spatially chaotic solutions and a multiplicity of multimodal homoclinic solutions exist. Poincare sections associated with the loss of integrability are displayed. Homoclinic solutions are computed and post-buckling paths found using continutaion methods. The <b>rods</b> <b>buckle</b> in a Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcation about a periodic solution.

30|$|Tubular string {{buckling}} is {{an important}} issue in well engineering. Buckling makes the initially straight tubular string buckle into curved shapes, which {{is an important}} reason for the well deviation problem. Buckling can also increase both bending stress on the tubular string and the contact force between the tubular string and the wellbore, which may further lead to serious down-hole problems such as tubular string failure, casing wear, hard slack off, or even “lock up.” Down-hole tubular string buckling is usually taken as analogous to the Euler buckling problem for a rod with axial compressive forces on both ends. The rod remains straight until the axial force exceeds a certain value, namely the critical load. When the axial force is larger than the critical value, the initial configuration becomes unstable and the <b>rod</b> <b>buckles</b> into a laterally deformed configuration. However, unlike the free post-buckling deflection of the Euler rod, various external factors, such as the constraint of wellbore, tubular string weight, torque, friction force, etc., make tubular string buckling behavior more complex.|$|R

A {{review of the}} context in which SPH can be used, the theory behind the governing equations and the adaptations carried out to enable elastic body problems to be simulated is presented. An algorithm is proposed to improve the ability for SPH to model contact between deformable surfaces. Non-linear behaviour is simulated via the introduction of plasticity, a statistical damage model and the introduction of friction between surfaces. It is shown how SPH can successfully model the <b>buckling</b> in slender <b>rods</b> and match predictions even under extreme deformations. The culmination of these techniques is used to simulate the mechanical properties of thermal barrier coatings (TBC). The simulated effect of increasing the size of gaps in the columnar structure of TBC is shown to reduce hardness.

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} {{the main features}} of the spectral theory for the singular two-point boundary-value problem and which models the <b>buckling</b> of a <b>rod</b> whose cross-sectional area decays to zero at one end. The degree of tapering {{is related to the}} rate at which the coefficient A tends to zero as s approaches 0. We say that there is tapering of order p ≥ 0 when A C([0, 1]) with A(s) > 0 for s (0, 1] and there is a constant L (0, ∞) such that lims→ 0 A(s) /sp = L. A rigorous spectral theory involves relating (1) −(3) to the spectrum of a linear operator in a function space and then investigating the spectrum of that operator. We do this in two different (but, as we show, equivalent) settings, each of which is natural from a certain point of view. The main conclusion is that the spectral properties of the problem for tapering of order p = 2 are very different from what occurs for p < 2. For p = 2, there is a non-trivial essential spectrum and possibly no eigenvalues, whereas for p < 2, the whole spectrum consists of a sequence of simple eigenvalues. Establishing the details of this spectral theory is an important step in the study of the corresponding nonlinear model. The first function space that we choose is the one best suited to the mechanical interpretation of the problem and the one that is used for treating the nonlinear problem. However, we relate this formulation in a precise way to the usual L 2 setting that is most common when dealing with boundary-value problem...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of an {{experimental}} investigation of the mechanics of thin elastic rods under a variety of loading conditions. Four scenarios are explored, with increasing complexity: i) the shape of a naturally curved rod suspended under self-weight, ii) the buckling and post-buckling behavior of a rod compressed inside a cylindrical constraint, iii) the mechanical instabilities arising when a rod is progressively injected into a horizontal cylinder, and iv) strategies for mitigation of these instabilities by dynamic excitation of the constraint. First, we consider the role of natural curvature in determining the shape of a hanging elastic rod suspended under its own weight. We categorize three distinct configurations: planar hooks, localized helices, and global helices. Experimental results are contrasted with simulations and theory and the phase diagram of the system is rationalized. Secondly, in what we call the classic case experiment, we study the buckling and post-buckling behavior of a rod compressed inside a cylindrical constraint. Under imposed displacement, the initially straight <b>rod</b> <b>buckles</b> into a sinusoidal mode and eventually undergoes a secondary instability into a helical configuration. The critical buckling loads are quantified and found to depend strongly on the aspect ratio of the rod to pipe diameter. Thirdly, we inject a thin elastic rod into a horizontal cylinder under imposed velocity in the real case experiment. Friction between the rod and constraining pipe causes an increasing axial load with continued injection. Consecutive buckling transitions lead to straight, sinusoidal, and helical configurations in a spatially heterogeneous distribution. We quantify critical lengths and loads for the onset of the helical instability. The geometric parameters of the system strongly affect the buckling and post-buckling behavior. Finally, we explore active strategies for delaying the onset of helical buckling in the real case. Distributed vertical vibration is applied to the cylindrical constraint, which destabilizes frictional contacts between the rod and pipe. Injection speed, peak acceleration of vibration, and vibration frequency are all found to affect the postponement of helical initiation. The process is rationalized and designby James T. Miller.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we studied}} three small {{subjects}} {{in the realm of}} continuum mechanics: imbibition in fluid mechanics, beam and <b>rod</b> <b>buckling</b> in solid mechanics and shell buckling at the solid-liquid interface. In chapter 2, we examined the radial imbibition into a homogenous semi-infinite porous media from a point source with infinite liquid supply. We proved that in the absence of gravity (or in the regime while gravity is negligible compared to surface tension), the shape of the wet area is a hemisphere, and the radius of the wet area evolves as a function with respect to time. This new law with respect to time has been verified by Finite Element Method simulation in software COMSOL and a series of experiments using packed glass microsphere as the porous media. We also found that even though the imbibition slows down, the flow rate through the point source remains constant. This new result for three dimensional radial imbibition complements the classic Lucas-Washburn law in one dimension and two dimensional radial imbibition in one plane. In chapter 3, we studied the elastic beam/rod buckling under lateral constraints in two dimension as well as in three dimension. For the two dimensional case with unique boundary conditions at both ends, the buckled beam can be divided into segments with alternate curved section and straight section. The curved section can be solved by the Euler beam equation. The straight sections, however, are key to the transition between different buckling modes, and the redistributed length of straight sections sets the upper limit and lower limit for the transition. We compared our theoretical model of varying straight sections with Finite Element Method simulation in software ABAQUS, and good agreements are found. We then attempted to employ this model as an explanation with qualitative feasibility for the crawling snake in horizontal plane between parallel walls, which shows unique shape like square wave. For the three dimensional buckling beam/rod confined in cylindrical constraints, three stages are found for the buckling and post buckling processes: initial two dimensional shape, three dimensional spiral/helix shape and final foldup/alpha shape. We characterized the shape at each stage, and then we calculated the transition points between the three stages using geometrical arguments for energy arguments. The theoretical analysis for three dimensional beam/rod are also complemented with Finite Element Method simulations from ABAQUS. In chapter 4, we investigated the buckling shape of solid shell filled with liquid core in two dimension and three dimension. A material model for liquid is first described that can be readily incorporated in the framework of solid mechanics. We then applied this material model in two dimensional and three dimensional Finite Element Method simulation using software ABAQUS. For the two dimensional liquid core solid shell model, a linear analysis is first performed to identify that ellipse corresponds to lowest order of buckling with smallest elastic energy. Finite Element Method simulation is then performed to determine the nonlinear post-buckling process. We discovered that two dimensional liquid core solid shell structures converge to peanut shape eventually while the evolution process is determined by two dimensionless parameters Kτ/μ and ρR^ 2 /μτ. Amorphous shape exists before final peanut shape for certain models with specific Kτ/μ and ρR^ 2 /μτ. The two dimensional peanut shape is also verified with Lattice Boltzmann simulations. For the three dimensional liquid core solid shell model, the post buckling shape is studied from Finite Element Method simulations in ABAQUS. Depending on the strain loading rate, the deformations show distinctive patterns. Large loading rate induces herringbone pattern on the surface of solid shell which resembles solid core solid shell structure, while small loading rate induces major concave pattern which resemble empty solid shell structure. For both two dimensional and three dimensional liquid core system, small scale ordered deformation pattern can be generated by increasing the shear stress in liquid core. In the final chapter, we summarized the discoveries in the dissertation with highlights on the role that geometry plays in all of the three subjects. Recommendations for future studies are also discussed...|$|R
