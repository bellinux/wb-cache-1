5|$|Like {{all other}} US states, New Jersey sets a 0.08 percent {{weight by volume}} <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> (BAC) as the {{threshold}} for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle (e.g. automobile, boat). It is possible {{to be charged with}} driving under the influence (DUI) with a BAC level below 0.08%, but there is a presumption in that situation that the driver is not intoxicated. State law prohibits those under 21 from driving if their BAC is 0.01% or more, prohibits the operation of a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or more, and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer. To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey, a person must be operating or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle; thus activities such as sleeping in a car while intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal.|$|E

25|$|Breath analyzers do not {{directly}} measure <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> or concentration, which requires {{the analysis of}} a blood sample. Instead, they estimate BAC indirectly by measuring the amount of alcohol in one's breath. In general, two types of breathalyzer are used. Small hand-held breathalyzers are not reliable enough to provide evidence in court but reliable enough to justify an arrest. Larger breathalyzer devices found in police stations can then be used to produce court evidence.|$|E

Dykstra suffered broken ribs, a broken collarbone and a broken facial bone, in addition to second-degree burns on his left arm and lower back. Darren Daulton, also a teammate, was a passenger in the car at the time; his injuries included an injured eye and a broken facial bone. According to Radnor Township Police, Dykstra's <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> was measured at 0.179% shortly after the crash.|$|E

When the police arrived Dersch refused the breathalizer. The police noticed that his eyes were glazed and he appeared intoxicated. He {{was taken to the}} hospital where the doctor tried to give him an intravenous line which he resisted. Eventually he passed out and the intravenous was given and a blood sample was taken.

50|$|Forensic {{metrology}} is metrology, {{the science}} of measurement, {{as it applies to}} forensic sciences. Forensic laboratories and criminalistic laboratories perform numerous measurements and tests to support both criminal and civil legal actions. Examples of forensic metrology include the measurement of <b>blood</b> or breath <b>alcohol</b> <b>content,</b> the quantification of controlled substances (both net weights and purity), and length measurements of firearm barrels. The results of forensic measurements are used to determine if a person is charged with a crime or may be used to determine a statutory sentencing enhancement. Other examples of forensic metrology includes tests that measure if there is a presence of a substance (e.g., cocaine), latent print examination, questioned documents examination, and DNA analysis.|$|R
25|$|Other {{substances}} that might reduce the BrAC reading include {{a bag of}} activated charcoal concealed in the mouth (to absorb alcohol vapor), an oxidizing gas (such as N2O, Cl2, O3, etc.) that would fool a fuel cell type detector, or an organic interferent to fool an infrared absorption detector. The infrared absorption detector is more vulnerable to interference than a laboratory instrument measuring a continuous absorption spectrum since it only makes measurements at particular discrete wavelengths. However, {{due to the fact}} that any interference can only cause higher absorption, not lower, the estimated <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> will be overestimated.|$|E
25|$|The {{concentration}} of alcohol in blood is measured via <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> (BAC). The amount and circumstances of consumption play {{a large part}} in determining the extent of intoxication; for example, eating a heavy meal before alcohol consumption causes alcohol to absorb more slowly. The amount of alcohol consumed largely determines the extent of hangovers, although hydration also plays a role. After excessive drinking, stupor and unconsciousness can occur. Extreme levels of consumption can lead to alcohol poisoning and death (a concentration in the blood stream of 0.40% will kill half of those affected). Alcohol may also cause death indirectly, by asphyxiation from vomit.|$|E
25|$|Tragedy {{struck the}} team just eight {{days after the}} sale, as star forward Dany Heatley crashed his Ferrari in a one-car {{accident}} that seriously injured both himself and Thrashers center Dan Snyder. Heatley suffered a broken jaw and arm, a sprained wrist and a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL); Snyder died five days later due to septic shock from his injuries. The Thrashers dedicated their entire 2003–04 season to Snyder's memory, and Thrashers players wore black patches with Snyder's number, 37, on their jerseys for the season. Heatley's <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> was below the legal limit, but his combination of speeding (he was driving an estimated 80 miles per hour) and recklessness led to criminal charges, which were later dropped. He eventually received three years' probation and community service.|$|E

50|$|Like {{every other}} {{state in the}} United States, driving under the {{influence}} is a crime in Oklahoma, and is subject to a great number of regulations. It is illegal to drive with a <b>blood</b> or breath <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> of 0.08% or more, or while {{under the influence of alcohol}} or any other intoxicating substance. For any person under 21 years of age, Oklahoma has a zero tolerance policy. The breath alcohol limit for such a person is 0.02%, and any measurable level of alcohol by a breathalyzer is an automatic DUI and driver's license revocation. This crime is punishable by a fine of up $1,000 US dollars and up to 1 year imprisonment after being evaluated by a person certified by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} if drinking one standard drink per hour could keep <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentration below {{the legal limit}} of 0. 05 % in Thai men and women. Material and Method: After overnight fast, 15 healthy Thai men and 15 healthy Thai women received 12 g of ethanol by drinking beer, rum, or carbonate mixed rum and their <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentrations were moni-tored every 15 min for 1 hours. Results: With one standard drink or 12 g of ethanol per hour, both Thai men and women had <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentrations below 0. 05 %. At 45 min after drinking, women had significantly higher <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> concen-trations than men (p < 0. 05). There was an inverse correlation between <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentrations and the person’s body weight. <b>Blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentrations were very low when alcoholic beverage was taken immediately after a meal. However, drinking alcohol along with a snack {{had no effect on}} <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentrations. Drinking carbonate mixed rum led to the highest <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> levels, followed by beer either rapidly drinking or sipping and pure rum, respectively. Conclusion: For Thai people, one standard drink per hour should be considered in the definition of safe level of drinking for men and women driving motor vehicles. It will be safer if drinking immediately after a big meal. Due to rapid absorption of alcohol in the bloodstream, drinking a beverage with low <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> could inebriate more rapidly...|$|R

40|$|Introduction and Aims: To {{encourage}} moderate alcohol consumption, many {{governments have}} developed guidelines for alcohol intake, guidelines for alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and legislation relating to <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> limits when driving. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the degree of international consensus within such guidelines. Design and Methods: Official definitions of standard and consumption guidelines were searched for on government websites, including all 27 European Union Member States and countries from all global geographic regions. Results: There was a remarkable lack of agreement about what constitutes harmful or excessive alcohol consumption on a daily basis, a weekly basis, and when driving, with no consensus about the ratios of consumption guidelines for men and women. Discussion and Conclusions: International consensus in low risk drinking guidelines is an important - and achievable - goal. Such agreement would facilitate consistent labelling of packaged products and could help to promote moderate alcohol consumption. However, there are some paradoxes related to <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> labelling and people’s use of such information: although clearer information could increase people’s capacity to monitor and regulate their alcohol consumption, not all drinkers are motivated to drink moderately or sensibly, and drinkers who intend to get drunk may use <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> labelling to select more alcoholic products...|$|R

Thus the assertion that a constant partition coefficient of 2100 exists between <b>alcohol</b> in <b>blood</b> and that in breath is not supported by the evidence. Accordingly the use of such a partition coefficient to derive <b>blood</b> <b>alcohol</b> values for law enforcement is not justified...|$|R
