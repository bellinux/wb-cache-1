50|$|In {{the industrialized}} world, these designs have been {{superseded}} by the electric iron, which uses resistive heating from an electric current. The hot plate, called the sole plate, {{is made of}} aluminium or stainless steel polished to be as smooth as possible; it is sometimes coated with a low-friction heat-resistant plastic to reduce friction below that of the metal plate. The heating element is controlled by a thermostat that switches the current on and off to maintain the selected temperature. The invention of the resistively heated electric iron is credited to Henry W. Seeley of New York City in 1882. In the same year an iron heated by a carbon arc was introduced in France, but was too dangerous to be successful. The early electric irons had {{no easy way to}} control their temperature, and the first thermostatically controlled electric iron appeared in the 1920s. Later, steam was used to iron clothing. Credit for the invention of the <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> goes to Thomas Sears. The first commercially available electric <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> was introduced in 1926 by a New York drying and cleaning company, Eldec, but was not a commercial success. The patent <b>for</b> an electric <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> and dampener was issued to Max Skolnik of Chicago in 1934. In 1938 Skolnik granted the Steam-O-Matic Corporation of New York the exclusive right to manufacture steam-electric irons. This was the first <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> to achieve any degree of popularity, and led the way to more widespread use of the electric <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> during the 1940s and 1950s.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} is focused on two studies. The {{kinetics}} 0 : methane steam reforming over a Ni/MgO catalyst at high pressure is reported in the first study. The second study {{is focused on the}} <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> process over promoted Fe-oxide based catalyst using four different reductants; H 2, H 2 /CO mixture, CH 4 and CH 4 /C 02 mixture. A kinetic study of methane steam reforming over a Ni/MgO catalyst at high pressure was carried out. The kinetic orders of methane and steam at 40 bars and 600 QC were found to be 0. 82 and 0. 62 respectively. 1 ~he estimation of energy of activation of the process was found to be 106 KJ/mol. T 11 e reaction rate data was explained by a Langmuir - Hinshelwood - Hougen - Wastson model. Four differe 11 t reductants (H 2, H 2 /CO mixture, CI- 4 and CH 4 /C 02 mixture), were applied {{for the study of the}} <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> process. A study of the <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> process using H 2 as reductant focused on the first reduction of 4 %Cr 203 - 96 % Fe 203 with H 2. The first reduction was found to be composed of a two step reduction up to 550 QC. The estimation of energy of activation for the process was found to be 92. 4 KJ/mol and 68. 2 KJ/mol respectively. The study of the <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> process using H 2 ICO mixture as reductant over 4 %Cr 203 - 96 % Fe 2 O 3 found that FeO was an intermediate for the reduction of Fe 203 with H 2 ICO mixture to Fe metal. The application of methane as reductant <b>for</b> the <b>steam</b> <b>iron</b> process gave the worst results. As a result, NiO was added to Cr 203 -Fe 203 to increase the activity. Carbon formation on NiO also was found to be a serious problem. In order to minimize carbon formation on NiO, CO 2 was introduced in a mix with CI- 4 for the oxidation of deposited carbon during the reduction step. Although the introduction of CO 2 can suppress carbon formation, the strong oxidation of reduced iron oxide by water formed during the reduction process coupled to the l 1 igher favorable reaction of the water gas shift reaction adversely affects the complete reduction of iron oxide to iron metal...|$|R
50|$|A <b>steam</b> {{generator}} <b>iron</b> is {{a modified}} version of a standard <b>steam</b> <b>iron.</b> Like traditional <b>steam</b> <b>irons,</b> <b>steam</b> generator <b>irons</b> use a combination of heat and steam power to remove wrinkles while ironing, they usually have a water reservoir either fully attached or detachable and a boiler that converts the water into steam. A high volume of pressurised steam can be released either continuously or in burst mode.

40|$|This study e valuates the {{dimensional}} {{changes of}} steam-ironed plain knitted wool fabrics after conditioning in air and then washing with an IWS 7 A wash cycle.

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>steam</b> {{generator}} <b>irons,</b> pressurised and non-pressurised. A non-pressurised <b>steam</b> generator <b>iron</b> will produce a lot of steam but the steam is released at a lower speed, typically around 80-100 grams per minute. A pressurised <b>steam</b> generator <b>iron,</b> on the other hand, creates a highly pressurised environment that helps the steam penetrate fabric more efficiently. A pressurised <b>steam</b> generator <b>iron</b> will typically have a steam output of 100-120 grams per minute. The amount of pressure a <b>steam</b> generator <b>iron</b> has is measured in bars, with a higher bar number meaning the steam has more pressure. <b>Steam</b> generator <b>irons</b> typically have 3-6 bars of pressure.|$|R
50|$|Blocking {{can be done}} {{in several}} {{different}} ways. Depending on the method, the crafter may use rustproof pins, blocking wires, a steamer, or a <b>steam</b> <b>iron.</b> A stable flat surface and towels are standard. Fibres that tolerate water well may be wet blocked, shaping moist fabric into the desired shape and then allowing it to air dry. Cold blocking uses no heat and less water to achieve the same result by spraying water upon the material instead of immersing the fabric. Steam blocking uses a steamer or <b>steam</b> <b>iron,</b> but without applying direct pressure to the item.|$|R
