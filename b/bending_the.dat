5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a disorder}} {{that results in}} pain in the heel {{and bottom of the}} foot. The pain is usually most severe with the first steps of the day or following a period of rest. Pain is also frequently brought on by <b>bending</b> <b>the</b> foot and toes up towards the shin and may be worsened by a tight Achilles tendon. The condition typically comes on slowly. In about a third of people both legs are affected.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when <b>bending</b> <b>the</b> neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E

50|$|In {{fixed-wing}} aircraft, fuel {{is usually}} {{carried in the}} wings.

50|$|In {{the absence}} of a qualifier, <b>the</b> term <b>bending</b> is {{ambiguous}} because bending can occur locally in all objects.

25|$|A multiple-image quasar is a quasar whose light {{undergoes}} gravitational lensing, {{resulting in}} double, triple or quadruple {{images of the}} same quasar.

The initial radiographical images may be inconspicuous (a faint oblique line) and often even completely normal. After 1–2 weeks however, callus formation develops. The condition can be mistaken for osteomyelitis, transient synovitis or even child abuse. Contrary to CAST fractures, non-accidental injury typically affect the upper two-thirds or midshaft of the tibia.|$|E

25|$|Restriction endonucleases, {{also known}} as {{restriction}} enzymes are enzymes that cleave the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA at specific nucleotides sequences that are usually four to six nucleotides long. Studies performed by Horton and colleagues {{have shown that the}} mechanism by which these enzymes cleave the DNA involves base flipping as well as <b>bending</b> <b>the</b> DNA and the expansion of the minor groove. In 2006, Horton and colleagues, x-ray crystallography evidence was presented showing that the restriction endonuclease HinP1I utilizes base flipping in order to recognize its target sequence. This enzyme is known to cleave the DNA at the palindromic tetranucleotide sequence G↓CGC.|$|E
25|$|A typical plywood {{panel has}} face veneers {{of a higher}} grade than the core veneers. The {{principal}} function of the core layers {{is to increase the}} separation between the outer layers where the bending stresses are highest, thus increasing the panel's resistance to bending. As a result, thicker panels can span greater distances under the same loads. In <b>bending,</b> <b>the</b> maximum stress occurs in the outermost layers, one in tension, the other in compression. Bending stress decreases from the maximum at the face layers to nearly zero at the central layer. Shear stress, by contrast, is higher {{in the center of the}} panel, and at the outer fibres.|$|E
