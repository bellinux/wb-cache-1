40|$|The {{stabilization}} {{characteristics of}} premixed flames in an axisymmetric curved-wall jet burner have been experimentally investigated. This burner utilized the Coanda effect {{on top of}} a <b>burner</b> <b>tip.</b> The initially spherical <b>burner</b> <b>tip</b> was modified to a flat tip and a concave tip in order to improve flame stabilization by providing enough space for flow recirculation above the <b>burner</b> <b>tip</b> region. The flow characteristics have been visualized using a schlieren technique. Small-scale turbulence structure has been observed mainly in the interaction jet region (located downstream of the recirculation region) for large jet velocity (Reynolds number > 11, 500). An appreciable amount of air entrainment was exhibited from the half-angle of the jet spread, approximately 20. The averaged planar laser-induced fluorescence images of the flames for this large velocity demonstrated that the strong signal of OH radicals, representing reaction zones, existed in the recirculation zone, while it was weak in the interaction jet region due to intermittency and local extinction by the generation of small scale turbulence. The OH radical signals strengthened again in the merged jet region (downstream of the interaction jet region). In extreme cases of Reynolds number over 19, 000, a unique flame exhibiting OH radicals only in the recirculation zone was observed for the concave tip. The flame stabilization has been mapped by varying jet velocity and equivalence ratio, and the result showed that the stabilization characteristics were improved appreciably from the initial spherical tip design, especially for rich mixtures. The flow fields measured by a laser Doppler velocimetry confirmed the existence of recirculation zone and the expansion of the recirculation zones for the modified tips. The temperature profile measured by a coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy exhibited an intermittent nature, especially near the recirculation zone...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we study}} the near-extinction {{behavior}} of micro-jet diffusion (i. e. non-premixed) flame, so called microflame, formed {{in a preheated}} air (up to 1020 K) in order to elucidate the unique and promising stability mechanism due to miniaturization of the jet diffusion flame. Effects of fuel flow rate and preheated air temperature on overall flame shape, flame temperature and the <b>burner</b> <b>tip</b> temperature are examined experimentally. Furthermore, the slight premixing effect on the near-extinction character is also investigated {{in order to support}} the stability mechanism suggested by this study. Methane is used as fuel and the several kinds of burner material are employed in order to examine the role of the burner. It turns out that the increasing the preheated air temperature decreases the limiting minimum flow rate effectively to simulate well the ideal condition of miniaturization of jet flame. This allows the flame to stay close to the burner and suppress the heat loss to the ambient, accordingly, the <b>burner</b> <b>tip</b> is substantially heated up. Then, the fuel flowing through the burner ""receives"" the heat from the burner (heated by flame) effectively to enhance the reactivity, resulting in improving the stability. It is also suggested that the endothermic radical-chain reactions are promoted near the exit of the burner when the burner temperature is substantially heated, at which the back-diffused oxygen is penetrated. Our experimental observations convince the existence of the unique and promising stability mechanism apparently found in the miniaturization of the jet diffusion flame, where the flame and burner scale are almost identical and their thermal interaction becomes prominent.

40|$|A {{major part}} of the {{domestic}} and the industrial thermal energy requirement for the heating purpose is achieved by the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels using burners. The present study reveals that thermal characterisation of impinging flame jets can be performed with a steady state technique similar to thin metal foil technique used for impinging air jets. The target surface impinged by the premixed methane air flame jet is simultaneously cooled from the rear side by impinging air jets at different Reynolds number. One dimensional energy balance across the thickness of the plate is performed. The Nusselt number and the effectiveness distributions for a tube burner with the present technique matched reasonably well with the two-equation technique proposed in our previous work. Maximum deviations of 12 % and 15 % are observed for Nu and eta respectively. Correlations are developed for the local Nusselt number and effectiveness in terms of flame jet parameters. The burner is analysed for the thermal efficiency. For premixed cone flames, it is observed that the thermal efficiency increases with the Reynolds number and equivalence ratio and decreases with the <b>burner</b> <b>tip</b> to plate spacing.

In the present method, high resolution heat flux distribution is obtained by applying the inverse heat conduction technique using thermal infrared camera. The high resolution thermal imaging enables to capture the steep gradients of spatial heat flux distribution. Nusselt number and effectiveness distributions are obtained by analytical-numerical method of estimation of the adiabatic wall temperature. Three circular tube burners arranged in a staggered pattern with inter tube spacing (S/d) of 2 to 6 is considered. The ratio of distance from tube <b>burner</b> <b>tip</b> to the impingement plate (z/d) is varied from 2 to 6 while the Reynolds number is varied from 400 to 1000. For the smallest S/d = 2, the interaction amongst the flames is significant and leads to non-circular hot spot distribution for heat flux. The average Nusselt number and average effectiveness are higher for higher Re for all z/d unless the inner premixed cone touches the impingement plate. The average Nusselt number and average effectiveness are marginally higher for smaller S/d for the same z/d and Re. The coefficient of variance increases {{with the increase in}} S/d.

40|$|Impinging flame jets {{are widely}} used in {{industrial}} and domestic heating applications. Most of the studies in literature report heat flux and the wall temperature which are dimensional parameters. The proper way of presenting this data {{is in the form}} of Nusselt number and effectiveness which are non-dimensional parameters. In order to determine the Nusselt number (heat transfer coefficient), the knowledge of adiabatic wall temperature is essential. In the present work, a hybrid analytical-numerical method is proposed to evaluate the adiabatic wall temperature by computing the steady state adiabatic wall heat flux. Circular burner of 11. 5 mm diameter is used for impingement on a flat quartz plate. The Reynolds number range is 600 - 2400, ratio of distance from tube <b>burner</b> <b>tip</b> to impingement plate to tube burner diameter is 2 - 6 and the equivalence ratio is 1. The adiabatic wall temperature estimated by the present hybrid analytical-numerical method is in good agreement (within 3 - 5 %) with the experimentally measured adiabatic wall temperature.

The {{aim of the}} present study is to study the effect of swirl on flame jet impingement heat transfer characteristics. Four twisted tapes of twist ratios 2, 3. 2, 4. 5 and 7. 5 (corresponding swirl numbers of 0. 79, 0. 49, 0. 35 and 0. 21) are used to experimentally obtain the swirling flame jet. The effect of twist ratio at Reynolds number varying from 500 to 2500 and equivalence ratio varying from 0. 7 to 1. 5 for <b>burner</b> <b>tip</b> to impingement plate distances of 2 and 4 is studied. The effect of swirl is compared with that of no tape in the tube burner by estimating the average heat flux distribution and coefficient of variation of heat flux for two impingement regions - within two times the burner diameter from the stagnation point and four times diameter from the stagnation point. From the experimental study, it is found that swirl enhances the heat flux distribution by 40 - 140 % at low Reynolds number. At higher Reynolds number the effect of swirl is negative and is found to decrease the average heat flux distribution by 10 - 40 %. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The use of gas {{for power}} {{generation}} {{is likely to}} increase in the medium term. Also, the introduction of new fuels will ensure a higher generation with lower emissions under continuous operation. These scenarios lead to the conclusion {{that there will be a}} considerably more diverse range of fuel supply. However, the use of these new fuels contrasts with recent experiences of global operators who report increasing emissions and difficult combustion dynamics with even moderate variations in their fuel characteristics. Clearly there are significant challenges for fuel flexible gas turbines, particularly emission control, combustor dynamics and flame stability. Trials using a power derivative gas turbine combustor and a high hydrogen content fuel produced unusual flashback events, in that flashback was induced by either leaning of the fuel mixture by the increase of combustion air, or by a change in composition through the reduction of methane pilot fuel. The introduction of CO 2 through the combustors pilot injector prevented flashback from occurring under these circumstances. The resulting reduction of temperature in the combustion zone, indicated by lower <b>burner</b> <b>tip</b> temperatures causes a reduction in the emissions of nitrous oxides, whilst there is minimal effect on the effective turbine inlet temperature, only a 2. 3...|$|R

This would improve the heat transfer characteristics of the impinging flame jet. The studies on impinging flame jets reported in the literature are based on the fuel-air mixture at ambient temperature. In the present work, the inlet air for mixture is heated by an electrical heater. The heat flux distribution is estimated using an inverse heat conduction (IHCP) technique. The Nusselt number (Nu) and effectiveness (eta) distributions are obtained by estimating the adiabatic wall temperature (T-aw) by the analytical-numerical method.

Reynolds number (Re) varying from 500 to 2000 for the non-dimensional <b>burner</b> <b>tip</b> to impingement plate spacing (Z/d) of 2 - 6 and stoichiometric condition (phi = 1. 0) is considered for varying preheated condition.

40|$|Abstract — A CFD-based {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed for {{the determination of the}} volume concentration and number density of soot in a laminar diffusion flame of methane in air, under transient condition following ignition of the flame. The transience is studied from the point of ignition till the final steady state is reached. The burner is an axisymmetric co-flowing one with the fuel issuing through a central port and air through an annular port. Both normal air (non-preheated) and preheated air have been used for this simulation to capture the effect of preheating on soot distribution. Attention is focused on various soot forming and destruction processes, like nucleation, surface growth and oxidation, during the transient phase to evaluate their relative importance. The transient soot distribution has been studied with the help of radial distributions of soot at six different axial heights of 2 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, 8 cm, 10 cm and 12 cm respectively above the <b>burner</b> <b>tip.</b> Beyond 12 cm height, the concentration becomes very less in all cases. The contribution of surface growth towards soot formation is more significant than that of nucleation during the early periods following ignition. Once the high temperature reaches the oxygenenriched zone beyond the flame, the soot oxidation becomes important. Coagulation, on the other hand, limits the soot particle number. Preheating of air increases the soot volume fraction in the flame significantly. But, the soot distribution patterns remain almost similar to that with non-preheated air during the flame transient period and also in the steady state.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} {{that govern the}} combustion processes is important {{for being able to}} further increase the efficiency ofcombustion devices. Temperature is considered {{to be one of the}} most important parameters controlling the progression and finalproducts of combustion. Regulating the temperature in combustion devices enables higher degrees of efficiency to be achieved. Theengine components in combustion devices are subjected to high levels of thermal load. These can strain many of the engine componentsand if it is unattended to can lead to catastrophic engine failure. Temperature information can help to assess the thermal load the engineis experiencing and as a result can increase the longevity of the engine while at the same time enabling higher levels of efficiency to beattained. In addition, the production of emission gases is closely correlated to the temperature present during the combustion of fuel. Comprehending the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature can aid in finding measures to reduce the levels of emissiongenerated by a combustion engine. Although several different temperature-probing techniques that can provide temperature information are available, the harsh andreactive nature of the experimental conditions present within combustion engines can severely limit the applicability of such techniques. Phosphor thermometry excels in delivering precise and accurate temperature information concerning harsh environments such as thosepresent in combustion engines. It is a remote technique that is minimally intrusive and is highly robust. Phosphor thermometry utilizesthe temperature-dependent characteristic emission of thermographic phosphors to retrieve temperature information concerning asurface or a fluid. The temperatures can be determined either on the basis of the temperature dependence of the decay time of thephosphorescence or on the basis of temperature-dependent changes in the spectral distribution of the phosphorescence. The thesis presents the efforts that were made to develop the phosphor thermometry technique further. It involves demonstrations ofuse of this technique in combustion engines of different types. The results of the thesis work are reported in two major parts. In thefirst part, developments that were made in regard to certain fundamentals of the technique so as to improve its accuracy and precisionare documented. This includes the development of an automatic calibration routine, a more precise characterization of the detectorresponse, and investigation of the effects of engine lubricant oil on the performance of several different thermographic phosphors.

40|$|Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is an {{important}} semiconducting metal oxide {{and is expected to}} play {{an important}} role in future applications related to photonic crystals, energy storage, and photocatalysis. Two aspects regarding the combustion synthesis have been investigated; scale-up in laboratory synthesis and advanced nanoparticle synthesis. Concerning the scale-up issue, a novel curved wall-jet (CWJ) burner was designed for flame synthesis. This was achieved by injecting precursors of TiO 2 through a central port into different flames zones that were stabilized by supplying fuel/air mixtures as an annular-inward jet over the curved wall. This provides a rapid mixing of precursors in the reaction zone with hot products. In order to increase the contact surface between the precursor and reactants as well as its residence time within the hot products, we proposed two different modifications. The CWJ burner was modified by adding a poppet valve on top of the central port to deliver the precursor tangentially into the recirculating flow upstream within the recirculation zone. Another modification was made by adopting double-slit curved wall-jet (DS-CWJ) configuration, one for the reacting mixture and the other for the precursor instead of the central port. Particle growth of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanoparticles and their phases were investigated. Ethylene (C 2 H 4), propane (C 3 H 8), and methane (CH 4) were used with varying equivalence ratio and Reynolds number and titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) was the precursor. Flow field and flame structure were quantified using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and OH planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) techniques, respectively. TiO 2 nanoparticles were characterized using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman Spectroscopy, and BET nitrogen adsorption for surface area analysis. The flow field quantified by PIV consisted of a wall-jet region leading to a recirculation zone, an interaction jet region, followed by a merged-jet region. The modified CWJ burner revealed appreciable mixing characteristics between the precursor and combustion gases within these regions, with a slight increase in the axial velocity due to the precursor injection. This led to more uniformity in particle size distribution of the synthesized nanoparticles with the poppet valve (first modification). The double-slit modification improved the uniformity of generated nanoparticles at a very wide range of stable experimental conditions. Images of OH fluorescence showed that flames are tightly attached to the <b>burner</b> <b>tip</b> and TTIP has no influence on these flames structures. The particle size was slightly affected by the operating conditions. The phase of TiO 2 nanoparticles was mainly dependent on the equivalence ratio and fuel type, which impact flame height, heat release rate and high temperature residence time of the precursor vapor. For ethylene and methane flames, the anatase content is proportional to the equivalence ratio, whereas it is inversely proportional in the case of propane flames.

40|$|The team of TIAX LLC, ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company, and Callidus Technologies, LLC {{conducted}} a six-year program {{to develop an}} ultra-low emission process heater burner and an advanced high efficiency heater design. This project addresses the critical need of process heater operators for reliable, economical emission reduction technologies to comply with stringent emission regulations, and for heater design alternatives that reduce process heater energy requirements without significant cost increase. The key project targets were NOx emissions of 10 ppm (@ 3 % O 2), and a heater thermal efficiency of 95 percent. The ultra low NOx burner was developed {{through a series of}} pilot-scale and field tests combined with computational fluid dynamic modeling to arrive at simultaneous low emissions and suitable flame shape and stability. Pilot scale tests were run at TIAX, at the 2 MMBtu/hr scale, and at Callidus at 8 MMBtu/hr. The full scale burner was installed on a 14 burner atmospheric pipestill furnace at an ExxonMobil refinery. A variety of <b>burner</b> configurations, gas <b>tips</b> and flame stabilizers were tested to determine the lowest emissions with acceptable flame shape and stability. The resulting NOx emissions were 22 ppm on average. Starting in 2001, Callidus commercialized the original ultra low NOx burner and made subsequent design improvements in a series of commercial burners evolving from the original concept and/or development. Emissions in the field with the ultra low-NOx burner over a broad spectrum of heater applications have varied from 5 ppm to 30 ppm depending on heater geometry, heater service, fuel and firing capacity. To date, 1550 of the original burners, and 2500 of subsequent generation burners have been sold by Callidus. The advanced heater design was developed by parametric evaluations of a variety of furnace and combustion air preheater configurations and technologies for enhancing convective and radiative heat transfer. The design evolution relied heavily on computational fluid dynamic predictions of design alternatives. The final design features modular separate radiant cells, each with one and two-side fired vertical tubes. The convection section configuration is vertical tube banks enclosed in the radiant channels. Commercial modular plate air preheaters are used. The predicted performance for the integrated advanced heater and Callidus burner is 95 percent efficiency with 9 ppm NOx emissions firing natural gas, and 12 ppm firing refinery gas.
