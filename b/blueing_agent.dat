About 11-12 million gallons (41.6-45.4 million L) of Agent Orange were sprayed over southern Vietnam between 1961 and 1971. A prime area of Ranch Hand operations was in the Mekong Delta, where the U.S. Navy patrol boats were vulnerable to attack from the undergrowth at the water's edge.|$|R

Its only official use is for whitening fabrics. However, there have been many reports of customers finding interesting new ways to use Mrs Stewart's Bluing; whitening hair, dyeing hair, dyeing pets, cleaning windows, adding to bird baths, marking ski hills, dyeing jeans blue, and many more.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of modulation of cyclic GMP-associated vascular responses by methylene <b>blue,</b> an <b>agent</b> employed to inhibit the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase in tissues, was investi-gated in the cremaster muscle microcirculation of pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. The effect of topically applied agents on {{the diameter of}} third-order arterioles (1 5 - 20 m diameter) was de-termined by in vivo television microscopy. Topical application (100 I) of acetylcholine (0. 01 zg) or nitric oxide (0. 06 - 6 g) caused vasodilator responses that were inhibited (P <. 05, n = 6 - 8) 64 % and 30 to 1 00 %, respectively, by suffusion of the preparation with 5 M methyiene <b>blue.</b> <b>Agents</b> that are thought to produce activation of guanylate cyclase via cellular metabolism to nitric oxide, nitroglycerin (0. 5 ng- 0. 5 g) or nitroprusside (0. 5 ng- 0. 5 tg), also produced vasodilation.

5000|$|In the 1950s, sales {{plummeted}} {{when a new}} detergent, Tide, {{manufactured by}} rival Procter & Gamble, proved {{to be much more}} popular. Rinso was revamped in the early 1950s as a true detergent, with a <b>bluing</b> <b>agent,</b> and was rebranded as Rinso Blue, to differentiate it from the still available Rinso White which was still a soap, and had different packaging. By the mid-1960s the soap variation was discontinued; the detergent variation was again reformulated, and given a new name, Sunshine Rinso. The justification for the name change was that the new and improved Rinso now had [...] "sunshine whiteners".|$|R

50|$|In 1879, Fritz Henkel {{was entered}} {{as the sole}} owner in the {{register}} of companies. Sales of Henkel's Bleaching Soda increased so rapidly that within just one year the rented factory on the Schützenstraße in Düsseldorf was unable to meet the demand. Fritz Henkel decided to build his own factory with a railway link. In 1883, to improve liquidity and make better use of the company's travelling sales staff, Fritz Henkel decided to sell merchandise {{in addition to his}} detergents. Sales started in 1884. The range included the colorant ultramarine <b>bluing</b> <b>agent,</b> gloss starch, a liquid cleaning agent, a pomade for cleaning, beef extract, and a hair pomade. Very soon Henkel developed its international presence—in 1886, Henkel opened its first international sales office in Austria. Carl Pathe had gone to Vienna as a representative the year before. In 1893, Henkel established its first business links with England and Italy.|$|R

50|$|<b>Agent</b> <b>Blue</b> affects {{plants by}} {{causing them to}} dry out. As rice is highly {{dependent}} on water to live, using <b>Agent</b> <b>Blue</b> on these paddies can destroy an entire field and leave it unsuitable for further planting. This is why <b>Agent</b> <b>Blue</b> was also used where food was not a factor, but foliage was. The Vietcong had an advantage while fighting in Vietnam because {{they were used to}} the abundance of plant life on the battlefield. The US found themselves at a disadvantage and based on the precedent set by the British in Malaya, decided that the best retaliation would be to take the Vietcong's advantage away from them by removing their cover. Along roads, canals, railroads, and other transportation networks, Ranch Hand cleared several hundred yards using the herbicides to make ambushes more difficult for their enemies. In Laos, the herbicide removed the jungle canopy from the roads and trails used for infiltrating men and supplies, making them more vulnerable to attack from the air.|$|R

This information {{is used by}} agents to enhance their behaviour within the virtual world. In 1 b and 1 c the beige and <b>blue</b> <b>agents</b> use this enhanced behaviour to defeat their red opponents. We describe a framework for providing game agents with awareness of the intrinsic spatial qualities of the virtual worlds that they inhabit. We develop a novel data structure based on a modified medial axis, which establishes a mapping between the medial axis and world structures. This data structure {{can be used to}} perform queries about the width, curvature and connectivity of a space within a virtual world. Additional information, such as sampled visibility can also be integrated with this framework. An agent-based crowd simulation is adapted {{to make use of the}} sensory information provided by this data structure and the success of using this information within two game scenarios is evaluated...|$|R
50|$|In 1970, AAAS sent {{a team of}} scientists—the Herbicide Assessment Commission (HAC) {{consisting}} of Matthew Meselson, Arthur Westing, John Constable, and Robert Cook—to conduct field tests of the ecological impacts of the herbicide program in Vietnam. A 1969 report authored by K. Diane Courtney and others found that 2,4,5-T could cause birth defects and stillbirths in mice. This and follow-up studies led the U.S. government to restrict the use of 2,4,5-T in the U.S. in April 1970. The Department of Defense followed suit by 'temporarily' suspending the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam, though they continued to rely on Agent White for defoliation until supplies ran out and the last defoliation spray run took place on 9 May 1970. Sporadic crop destruction sorties using <b>Agent</b> <b>Blue</b> and <b>Agent</b> White continued throughout 1970 until the final Ranch Hand run was flown on 7 January 1971.|$|R
50|$|After a spymaster {{gives the}} hint with its word and number, their field {{operatives}} make guesses about which code name cards bear words {{related to the}} hint and point them out, one at a time. When a code name card is pointed out, the spymaster covers that card with an appropriate identity card -- a <b>blue</b> <b>agent</b> card, a red agent card, an innocent bystander card, or the assassin card -- as indicated on the spymasters' map of the grid. If the assassin is pointed out, the game ends immediately, with the team who identified him losing. If {{an agent of the}} other team is pointed out, the turn ends immediately, and that other team is also one agent closer to winning. If an innocent bystander is pointed out, the turn simply ends; but note that this also eliminates one more potential wrong guess that the other team might have made, right before their turn. If an agent of the playing team is pointed out, the team may point out another card if they have guesses left. Again, the maximum number of guesses in any turn is the hint's number plus one.|$|R
50|$|The Program Forces or Agents, are {{rule-based}} models used {{within the}} RSAC system. When designing these, a few necessary requirements {{needed to be}} met. The agents needed {{to be able to}} make operational and strategy decisions including, but not limited to, designing a war plan, deciding where to allocate forces, and whether or not to enter a battle depending on the risk vs. payoff. They also must be able to base their decisions on future projections of the conflict, not only the immediate future. For example, <b>Blue</b> <b>Agent</b> must first assess the current situation between itself and Red Agent, then consider the Scenario Agent’s status, and then make a possible prediction of a future scenario involving all three. The Agents are also able to adjust and make course corrections based on conflict outcomes and the amount of intelligence available to them. Lastly, some ‘’soft factors’’ are injected into the mix. An Agent should also attempt to determine the will and intentions of the opponent, morale of the troops and country, and also the strength of current alliances if applicable. Below are the Agents involved in the RSAC system.|$|R

30|$|I {{develop a}} 2 D {{cellular}} automata algorithmic model using Netlogo as the agent-based programming language. The agents {{come in two}} distinct breeds: red and <b>blue</b> <b>agents,</b> {{each member of the}} former set contains 1023 Mx of inward directed magnetic field, and the latter, an equal amount of outward directed magnetic field. The agents are displayed as arrows marking the direction they move relative to the bulk fluid motions, the well known meridional circulation and differential rotation. Our model deals with spatial and temporal differences from these steady fluid motions. Put simply, our algorithmic model calculates agent motions as follows. Agents are born in low-latitude active-regions through a random number generator, proportional to the polar field strength at the previous solar maximum, consistent with Hale’s and other statistical laws governing sunspot appearances. The magnetic field entities in this model move about on the solar surface by a number of flows and forces I describe, and eventually are annihilated when two opposite color agents come together in close contact. The model displays field patterns similar to the UMR patterns found by Bumba and Howard. The reasons for, and the model’s usage of, these patterns is more fully discussed in Appendix 1.|$|R

25|$|Foam-compatible, {{which is}} a sodium {{bicarbonate}} (BC) based dry chemical, was developed for use with protein foams for fighting class B fires. Most dry chemicals contain metal stearates to waterproof them, but these will tend to destroy the foam blanket created by protein (animal) based foams. Foam compatible type uses silicone as a waterproofing agent, which does not harm foam. Effectiveness is identical to regular dry chemical, and it is light green in color (some ANSUL brand formulations are <b>blue).</b> This <b>agent</b> is generally no longer used since most modern dry chemicals are considered compatible with synthetic foams such as AFFF.|$|R
