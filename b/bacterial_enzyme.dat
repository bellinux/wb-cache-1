25|$|The Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) enzyme {{structure}} in Escherichia coli {{was the first}} structure to be elucidated and understood. Since then, the Escherichia coli IDH structure {{has been used by}} most researchers to make comparisons to other isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes. There is much detailed knowledge about this <b>bacterial</b> <b>enzyme,</b> and it has been found that most isocitrate dehydrogenases are similar in structure and therefore also in function. This similarity of structure and function gives a {{reason to believe that the}} structures are conserved as well as the amino acids. Therefore, the active sites amongst most prokaryotic isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes should be conserved as well, which is observed throughout many studies done on prokaryotic enzymes. Eukaryotic isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes on the other hand, have not been fully discovered yet.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that {{protease}} enzymes become trapped in inactive antithrombin-protease complexes {{as a consequence of}} their attack on the reactive bond. Although attacking a similar bond within the normal protease substrate results in rapid proteolytic cleavage of the substrate, initiating an attack on the antithrombin reactive bond causes antithrombin to become activated and trap the enzyme at an intermediate stage of the proteolytic process. Given time, thrombin is able to cleave the reactive bond within antithrombin and an inactive antithrombin-thrombin complex will dissociate, however the time it takes for this to occur may be greater than 3 days. However bonds P3-P4 and P1'-P2' can be rapidly cleaved by neutrophil elastase and the <b>bacterial</b> <b>enzyme</b> thermolysin respectively, resulting in inactive antithrombins no longer able to inhibit thrombin activity.|$|E
25|$|Independent of {{nitric oxide}} synthase, an {{alternative}} pathway, coined the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, elevates nitric oxide through the sequential reduction of dietary nitrate derived from plant-based foods. Nitrate-rich vegetables, in particular leafy greens, such as spinach and arugula, and beetroot, {{have been shown}} to increase cardioprotective levels of nitric oxide with a corresponding reduction in blood pressure in pre-hypertensive persons. For the body to generate nitric oxide through the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, the reduction of nitrate to nitrite (by nitrate reductase, a <b>bacterial</b> <b>enzyme)</b> occurs in the mouth, by commensal bacteria, an obligatory and necessary step. Monitoring nitric oxide status by saliva testing detects the bioconversion of plant-derived nitrate into nitric oxide. A rise in salivary levels is indicative of diets rich in leafy vegetables which are often abundant in anti-hypertensive diets such as the DASH diet.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLignin forms a {{large part}} of plant biomass. It is a highly {{heterogeneous}} polymer of 4 -hydroxyphenylpropanoid units and is embedded within polysaccharide polymers forming lignocellulose. Lignin provides strength and rigidity to plants and is rather resilient towards degradation. To improve the (bio) processing of lignocellulosic feedstocks, more effective degradation methods of lignin are in demand. Nature has found ways to fully degrade lignin through the production of dedicated ligninolytic enzyme systems. While such enzymes have been well thoroughly studied for ligninolytic fungi, only in recent years biochemical studies on <b>bacterial</b> <b>enzymes</b> capable of lignin modification have intensified. This has revealed several types of enzymes available to bacteria that enable them to act on lignin. Two major classes of <b>bacterial</b> lignin-modifying <b>enzymes</b> are DyP-type peroxidases and laccases. Yet, recently also several other <b>bacterial</b> <b>enzymes</b> have been discovered that seem {{to play a role in}} lignin modifications. In the present review, we provide an overview of recent advances in the identification and use of <b>bacterial</b> <b>enzymes</b> acting on lignin or lignin-derived products...|$|R

30|$|A {{saponification}} reaction follows {{degradation of}} fatty acids {{in the cell}} membrane resulting {{in the formation of}} fatty acid salts (soap) and glycerol. Interactions between sodium hypochlorite and cell amino acids generate an exit of hydroxyl ions that in turn lower the pH of the solution which results in the release of hypochlorus acid which when in contact with organic tissue acts as a solvent-releasing chlorine which is a strong oxidant that inhibits <b>bacterial</b> <b>enzymes</b> by irreversibly oxidizing sulfhydryl groups of essential <b>bacterial</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Chlorines also combine with protein amino groups resulting in the formation of chloramines that interfere with bacterial cell metabolism (Estrela et al. 2002).|$|R

Secondarily, this released DNA is degraded by <b>bacterial</b> <b>enzymes,</b> mainly by the endonuclease I; the products of degradation are spontaneously released in the surrounding medium. Thus, in each T 5 phage stock it seems that there is a minor population that is deficient for the mechanism of controlled DNA injection into the bacteria...|$|R

40|$|AbstractColon cancer {{remains as}} a serious health problem around the world despite {{advances}} in diagnosis and treatment. Dietary fibers are considered {{to reduce the risk}} of colon cancer as they are converted to short chain fatty acids by the presence of anaerobic bacteria in the intestine, but imbalanced diet and high fat consumption may promote tumor formation at different sites, including the large bowel via increased <b>bacterial</b> <b>enzymes</b> activity. The present study was conducted to characterize the inhibitory action of myrtenal on <b>bacterial</b> <b>enzymes</b> and aberrant crypt foci (ACF). Experimental colon carcinogenesis induced by 1, 2 -dimethylhydrazine is histologically, morphologically, and anatomically similar to human colonic epithelial neoplasm. Discrete microscopic mucosal lesions such as ACF and malignant tumors function as important biomarkers in the diagnosis of colon cancer. Methylene blue staining was carried out to visualize the impact of 1, 2 -dimethylhydrazine and myrtenal. Myrtenal-treated animals showed decreased levels of <b>bacterial</b> <b>enzymes</b> such as β-glucuronidase, β-glucosidase, and mucinase.

The characterization of purple <b>bacterial</b> <b>enzymes</b> involved in these steps has been crucial in understanding similar enzymes from other sources.
