40|$|This study investigates how {{controlling}} shareholders fraudulently extracted firm value via cash tunnelling from Chinese {{companies from}} 1998 to 2011. The {{evidence suggests that}} expropriating owners choose a <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>account</b> that is {{not directly related to}} the firm’s operating business in order to record a fictitious asset, with the account remaining in the company’s books for a reasonably long time. The delay in recognising the fictitious asset as a loss in the financial statements makes it more difficult for auditors to detect the fraud. We develop two measures to estimate the total loss caused by the cash tunnelling, and estimate the loss to be two to four times net income. Evidence on the factors and process surrounding cash tunnelling is presented, and we demonstrate that the propensity to engage in tunnelling is positively related to the differential rights between controlling shareholders and minority shareholders and negatively related to firm profitability, the probability of fraud detection and the severity of the punishment. falsePublished onlin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} integrated macroeconomic {{accounts for}} the United States for the period 1985 to 2002 and discusses issues related to their construction and use. Specifically, it focuses on tying together the national income and product accounts (NIPAs) and international transaction accounts (ITA) published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the flow of funds accounts (FFA) published by the Federal Reserve Board. The paper provides integrated accounts for seven sectors: households and nonprofit organizations serving households, nonfinancial non-corporate businesses, nonfinancial corporate businesses, financial businesses, federal government, state and local governments, {{and the rest of}} the world. Each sector table has a full complement of accounts: current accounts (production and income accounts), accumulation accounts (capital account, financial account, and other changes in volume account), revaluation account, and <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>account.</b> As a result, the sector statements trace the factors leading to changes in sector net worth. Relative to current publications of the two agencies, the tables go quite a bit further toward providing for the United States the sequence of accounts suggested in the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 93), the recognized international standard. The tables use official data as of June 10, 2004; however, a few series have been created by the authors, and they are unofficial preliminary estimates at this time. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to launch a {{discussion}} on the general treatment of provisions and impairment of assets in the National Accounts, in the context of the review of the SNA. The paper argues that the SNA should recognize the provisions and impairment of assets that are recognised by business accounting standards, instead of, as currently, rejecting these items outside the scope of the accounts. The paper proposes the creation of new lines in the sequence of account, located just before the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>accounts,</b> where the SNA would record changes in provisions and impairment of assets. Also, the stock of provisions and impairment of assets would be available in the annual <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>accounts.</b> Both these pieces of information would come as an additional information to the existing tables. Far from being a revolution, this proposal would simply allow users to compile alternative values for the net worth of institutional sectors, including or excluding these items. One specific property of this additional information is that the tables would not be fully symmetrical. It is a small price to pay compared to the advantage of extending the scope of the SNA to these important accounting entries. By including these categories into the framework of the SNA, a new flexibility is introduced which will, first, help to clarify the treatment of some transactions and, more important, allow producers of national accounts to elaborate macro-economic information on “quasi-liabilities ” and “quasi-assets”, in particula...|$|R

But instead of using projected <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>accounts,</b> large accruals are reversed and cash effects are calculated based upon statistical distributions and algorithms. This allows the forecasting period to be weekly or even daily. It also eliminates the cumulative errors inherent in the direct, R&D method when it is extended beyond the short-term horizon. But because the ARM allocates both accrual reversals and cash effects to weeks or days, it is more complicated than the ANI or PBS indirect methods. The ARM is best suited to the medium-term forecasting horizon.|$|R
