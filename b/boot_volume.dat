25|$|The third {{generation}} Mini was unveiled by BMW in November 2013, with sales {{starting in the}} first half of 2014. The new car is 98 mm longer, 44 mm wider, and 7 mm taller than the outgoing model, with a 28 mm longer wheelbase and an increase in track width (+42 mm front and +34 mm rear). The increase in size results in a larger interior and a <b>boot</b> <b>volume</b> increase to 211 litres.|$|E
500|$|In {{order for}} BitLocker to encrypt the volume holding the {{operating}} system, {{at least two}} NTFS-formatted volumes are required: one for the operating system (usually C:) and another with a minimum size of 100MB from which the operating system boots. BitLocker requires the latter to remain unencryptedâ€”on Windows Vista this volume must be assigned a drive letter, while on Windows 7 that is not required. Unlike previous versions of Windows, Vista's [...] "diskpart" [...] command-line tool includes the ability to shrink {{the size of an}} NTFS volume so that this volume may be created from already allocated space. A tool called the BitLocker Drive Preparation Tool is also available from Microsoft that allows an existing volume on Windows Vista to be shrunk to make room for a new <b>boot</b> <b>volume</b> and for the necessary bootstrapping files to be transferred to it.|$|E
50|$|The {{system volume}} and the <b>boot</b> <b>volume</b> are {{respectively}} equivalents {{of the aforementioned}} terms.|$|E
50|$|ASR {{should be}} used {{only as a last}} resort because in {{preparation}} for a restore ASR will format the system and <b>boot</b> <b>volumes,</b> making other, less-drastic recovery methods impossible.|$|R
50|$|Retrospect Inc. markets {{additional}} Retrospect Windows Add-Ons {{for installations}} backing up Microsoft Exchange servers, Microsoft SQL servers, and VMware servers. It also markets Retrospect Windows Add-Ons for Dissimilar Hardware Restore of <b>boot</b> <b>volumes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Whilst {{supporting}} Rancid, Tim Armstrong {{asked the}} band to join Hellcat Records. The tracks Fools Gold and We Evolve feature on the Hellcat Records compilations Give 'Em the <b>Boot</b> <b>volumes</b> II and III respectively.|$|R
50|$|Filesystem access on the Recovery Console is {{by default}} {{severely}} limited. An administrator using the Recovery Console has only read-only {{access to all}} volumes except for the <b>boot</b> <b>volume,</b> and even on the <b>boot</b> <b>volume</b> only access to the root directory and to the Windows system directory (e.g. \WINNT). This can be changed by changing Security Policies to enable read/write access to the complete file system including copying files from removable media (i.e. floppy drives).|$|E
50|$|With {{its larger}} {{exterior}} dimensions, the all-new Mini provides more space for its four occupants and luggage, with enhanced shoulder space and larger footwells. <b>Boot</b> <b>volume</b> has been increased {{by more than}} 30% to 211 litres.|$|E
5000|$|Soon after, in February 2008, a restyled Modus and new the Grand Modus were launched. Also that year, the Grand Modus {{replaced}} the Modus in Spain. The Grand Modus has an extended length of 4034 mm and a <b>boot</b> <b>volume</b> of 410 litres (...) below the parcel shelf.|$|E
5000|$|Catching Flies {{collaborated with}} vocalist and {{producer}} Ifan Dafydd in August 2013 {{on the track}} [...] "Don't Know How" [...] which was released via Bandcamp as part of Push & Run's Tings in <b>Boots</b> <b>Volume</b> 2 compilation.|$|R
50|$|Automated system {{recovery}} (ASR) is {{a feature of}} the Windows XP operating system {{that can be used to}} simplify recovery of a computer's system or <b>boot</b> <b>volumes.</b> ASR consists of two parts: an automated backup, and an automated restore. The backup portion can be accessed in the Backup utility under System Tools.|$|R
2500|$|A kernel-mode rootkit variant {{called a}} bootkit, it can infect startup code like the Master <b>Boot</b> Record (MBR), <b>Volume</b> <b>Boot</b> Record (VBR) or boot sector, {{and in this}} way, {{can be used to}} attack full disk {{encryption}} systems.|$|R
5000|$|Microsoft first {{introduced}} the [...] "My Documents" [...] folder in Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2, {{as a standard}} location for storing user-created files. The folder, located under the root directory of the <b>boot</b> <b>volume.</b> A shortcut to it is displayed directly on the user's desktop.|$|E
50|$|Mac OS X Lion and newer offer FileVault 2, {{which is}} a {{significant}} redesign. This encrypts the entire OS X startup volume and typically includes the home directory, abandoning the disk image approach. For this approach to disk encryption, authorised users' information is loaded from a separate non-encrypted <b>boot</b> <b>volume</b> (partition/slice type Apple_Boot).|$|E
50|$|A 5-door {{estate car}} variant, the Ibiza ST, was {{announced}} in March 2010, at the Geneva Motor Show. The Ibiza ST is 4.23 m long, which increases the <b>boot</b> <b>volume</b> to 430 litres. Two new engine options were introduced with this model, a 105 PS 1.2 TSI (petrol) and a 75 PS 1.2 TDI diesel.|$|E

50|$|The Natural Power is the CNG/petrol bi-fuel {{version of}} the Panda. Unlike the {{previous}} generation - which adopted a 70 PS 1.4 FIRE inline four - it is powered by the turbocharged, 0.9 liter, two-cylinder TwinAir engine. The system is developed in-house and factory installed.CNG is stored in two - one 22 L and one 50 L - gas cylinders: the former housed longitudinally in the transmission tunnel, the latter transversally behind the rear axle. The <b>boot's</b> <b>volume</b> remains unvaried, thanks to the cylinders being both located under the floorpan; {{on the other hand}} this requires a 40 mm taller ride height and a reworked, transversal silencer.|$|R
50|$|Partition sector loads sector 0 of the {{bootable}} partition (<b>Volume</b> <b>Boot</b> Record). In this case, it's {{the host}} drive.|$|R
50|$|In Unix-like {{operating}} systems, volumes {{other than}} the <b>boot</b> <b>volume</b> have a mount-point somewhere within the filesystem, represented by a path. Logically, the directory tree stored on the volume is grafted in at the mountpoint. By convention, mount-points will often {{be placed in a}} directory called '/mnt', though '/media' and other terms are sometimes used.|$|E
50|$|The system {{partition}} and the boot partition (also {{known as the}} system volume and the <b>boot</b> <b>volume)</b> are computing terms for disk partitions of a hard disk drive or solid-state drive that must exist and be properly configured for a computer to operate. There are two different definitions for these terms: the common definition and the Microsoft definition.|$|E

The new car is 98 mm longer, 44 mm wider, and 7 mm taller than the outgoing model, with a 28 mm longer wheelbase and an increase in track width (+42 mm front and +34 mm rear). The increase in size results in a larger interior and a <b>boot</b> <b>volume</b> increase to 211 litres.|$|E
5000|$|As stated above, the {{conventional}} MBR bootstrap code loads and runs (boot loader- or operating system-dependent) <b>volume</b> <b>boot</b> record code that {{is located at}} the beginning of the [...] "active" [...] partition. A conventional <b>volume</b> <b>boot</b> record will fit within a 512-byte sector, but it is safe for MBR code to load additional sectors to accommodate boot loaders longer than one sector, provided they do not make any assumptions on what the sector size is. In fact, at least 1 KB of RAM is available at address 7C00hex in every IBM XT- and AT-class machine, so a 1 KB sector could be used with no problem. Like the MBR, a <b>volume</b> <b>boot</b> record normally expects to be loaded at address 0000hex:7C00hex. This derives from the fact that the <b>volume</b> <b>boot</b> record design originated on unpartitioned media, where a <b>volume</b> <b>boot</b> record would be directly loaded by the BIOS boot procedure; as mentioned above, the BIOS treats MBRs and <b>volume</b> <b>boot</b> records (VBRs) exactly alike. Since this is the same location where the MBR is loaded, one of the first tasks of an MBR is to relocate itself somewhere else in memory. The relocation address is determined by the MBR, but it is most often 0000hex:0600hex (for MS-DOS/PC DOS, OS/2 and Windows MBR code) or 0060hex:0000hex (most DR-DOS MBRs). (Even though both of these segmented addresses resolve to the same physical memory address in real mode, for Apple Darwin to boot, the MBR must be relocated to 0000hex:0600hex instead of 0060hex:0000hex, since the code depends on the DS:SI pointer to the partition entry provided by the MBR, but it erroneously refers to it via 0000hex:SI only.) While the MBR code relocates itself it is still important not to relocate to other addresses in memory because many VBRs will assume a certain standard memory layout when loading their boot file.|$|R
5000|$|Bootstrap code: Instructions to {{identify}} the configured bootable partition, then load and execute its <b>volume</b> <b>boot</b> record (VBR) as a chain loader.|$|R
25|$|NTLDR is {{launched}} by the <b>volume</b> <b>boot</b> record of system partition, which is typically written to the disk by the Windows FORMAT or SYS command.|$|R
50|$|The host {{computer}} (the computer {{into which the}} Target Disk Mode booted computer is plugged) merely needs to meet the same requirements as for any external mass storage device using the bus in question, and (if access to native Mac formatted partitions such as the <b>boot</b> <b>volume</b> is desired) support for the correct version of Hierarchical File System. On Classic Mac OS, this means FireWire 2.3.3 or later and Mac OS 8.6 or later are required to use a Firewire target.|$|E
5000|$|MacWorks XL shipped on two diskettes. The first booted the Lisa {{into the}} Mac OS bootloader. When that process completed, the system {{displayed}} an entire white screen, ejected the first disk, and displayed the usual blinking question mark (but with a Macintosh XL graphic below) {{to indicate that}} a <b>boot</b> <b>volume</b> (the other disk) was needed. Upon insertion of the second disk, titled [...] "MacWorks XL System Disk", the Lisa would boot Macintosh System 5 (Mac OS 5 in modern nomenclature).|$|E
50|$|The third {{generation}} Proton Saga measures 4,331 mm long, 1,689 mm wide and 1,491 mm tall. The wheelbase length at 2,465 mm has remained unchanged since the Saga BLM, but both {{front and rear}} overhangs have been extended by 44mm and 30mm respectively. The <b>boot</b> <b>volume</b> is rated at 420 litres, 7 litres larger than the outgoing model. The {{third generation}} Saga is approximately 74mm longer, 9mm wider and 11mm shorter than the Saga BLM and 53mm longer, 9mm wider and 29mm shorter than the Saga FL and Saga FLX family.|$|E
5000|$|A Master Boot Record (MBR) is {{the first}} sector of a data storage device that has been {{partition}}ed. The MBR sector may contain code to locate the active partition and invoke its <b>Volume</b> <b>Boot</b> Record.|$|R
50|$|The code in <b>volume</b> <b>boot</b> records is invoked either {{directly}} by the machine's firmware or indirectly by code in the master boot record or a boot manager. Code in the MBR and VBR is in essence loaded the same way.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Volume</b> <b>Boot</b> Record (VBR) (also {{known as}} a <b>volume</b> <b>boot</b> sector, a {{partition}} boot record or a partition boot sector) {{is a type of}} boot sector introduced by the IBM Personal Computer. It may be found on a partitioned data storage device such as a hard disk, or an unpartitioned device such as a floppy disk, and contains machine code for bootstrapping programs (usually, but not necessarily, operating systems) stored {{in other parts of the}} device. On non-partitioned storage devices, it is the first sector of the device. On partitioned devices, it is the first sector of an individual partition on the device, with the first sector of the entire device being a Master Boot Record (MBR) containing the partition table.|$|R
50|$|Those who {{required}} real RAM-like {{performance and}} non-volatility typically {{have had to}} use conventional RAM devices and a battery backup. This nonvolatile BIOS memory, often called CMOS RAM or parameter RAM, was a common solution in earlier computer systems like the original Apple Macintosh, which used {{a small amount of}} memory powered by a battery for storing basic setup information like the selected <b>boot</b> <b>volume.</b> Much larger battery backed memories are still used today as caches for high-speed databases, requiring a performance level newer NVRAM devices have not yet managed to meet.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} Priam's InnerSpace series offered fully {{integrated}} disk drive solutions to overcome disk capacity limitations imposed by MS-DOS {{prior to the}} release of version 3.31/4.0. This included custom hard disk controllers (based on Western Digital designs) as well as dedicated software for formatting (PFMT.EXE) and partitioning (EDISK.EXE). PFMT.EXE placed a driver EVDR.SYS into the root directory of the <b>boot</b> <b>volume.</b> This was used by DOS to retrieve drive and partitioning information located in the last 12 KB of the disk. Priam's EDISK also used dedicated MBR partition IDs 0x45 and 0x5C. Solutions were offered for DOS, NetWare, Unix and Pick.|$|E
50|$|The new Proton Persona {{measures}} 4,387 mm long, 1,722 mm {{wide and}} 1,554 mm tall. The wheelbase length at 2,555 mm is unchanged over the Iriz, but the rear overhang {{has been extended}} to support a large 510-litre boot, compared to just 215 litres in the Iriz. In terms of size comparisons, the new BH Persona is 482 mm longer, 2 mm wider and 4 mm taller than the Iriz, and 90 mm shorter, 3 mm narrower and 116 mm taller than the old CM Persona. Additionally, the wheelbase length of the BH is 45 mm shorter than the CM, but the <b>boot</b> <b>volume</b> is 80-litres larger.|$|E
40|$|This ECMA Standard is {{a volume}} and file {{structure}} standard for interchanging files and as such, it is a peer to existing volume and file structure standards such as ECMA- 107 and ECMA- 119. It is rather {{different from those}} standards {{in at least two}} important ways. Firstly, it offers much more functionality, mainly because of user needs for increased character set support and for more powerful file system features. Secondly, it acknowledges the separate concerns of <b>booting,</b> <b>volume</b> structure and file system structure. Rather than bundling these different functions together, this ECMA Standard carefully segregates these functions into separate parts and describes in detail how those parts fit together. It is expected that future volume and file structure standards will fit into this framework, rather than building other distinct and incompatible formats. This ECMA Standard consists of five Parts published in one Volume. Part 1 - General- specifies references, definitions, notations and basic structures used in the other four Parts. Part 2 - <b>Volume</b> and <b>boot</b> block recognition- specifies formats and system requirements for recognising the volume structures on a medium and booting from a medium. Part 3 - Volume structure- specifies how to record various volume-related entities such as volumes, volume sets and logical volumes. Part 4 - Fil...|$|R
5000|$|Partition 'a' is the [...] "root" [...] partition, {{the volume}} {{from which the}} {{operating}} system is bootstrapped. The boot code in the <b>Volume</b> <b>Boot</b> Record containing the disklabel is thus simplified, as it need only look in one fixed location to find {{the location of the}} boot volume; ...|$|R
5000|$|From a {{technical}} standpoint, {{it is important}} to note that the distinction between an MBR and a <b>volume</b> <b>boot</b> record exists only at the user software level, above the BIOS firmware. (Here, the term [...] "user software" [...] refers to both operating system software and application software.) To the BIOS, removable (e.g. floppy) and fixed disks are essentially the same. For either, the BIOS reads the first physical sector of the media into RAM at absolute address 7C00hex, checks the signature in the last two bytes of the loaded sector, and then, if the correct signature is found, transfers control to the first byte of the sector with a jump (JMP) instruction. The only real distinction that the BIOS makes is that (by default, or if the boot order is not configurable) it attempts to boot from the first removable disk before trying to boot from the first fixed disk. From the perspective of the BIOS, the action of the MBR loading a <b>volume</b> <b>boot</b> record into RAM is exactly the same as the action of a floppy disk <b>volume</b> <b>boot</b> record loading the object code of an operating system loader into RAM. In either case, the program that BIOS loaded is going about the work of chain loading an operating system. The distinction between an MBR and a <b>volume</b> <b>boot</b> record is an OS software-level abstraction, designed to help people to understand the operational organization and structure of the system. That distinction doesn't exist for the BIOS. Whatever the BIOS directly loads, be it an MBR or a <b>volume</b> <b>boot</b> record, is given total control of the system, and the BIOS from that point is solely at the service of that program. The loaded program owns the machine (until the next reboot, at least). With its total control, this program is not required to ever call the BIOS again and may even shut BIOS down completely, by removing the BIOS ISR vectors from the processor interrupt vector table, and then overwrite the BIOS data area. This is mentioned to emphasize that the boot program that the BIOS loads and runs from the first sector of a disk can truly do anything, so long as the program does not call for BIOS services or allow BIOS ISRs to be invoked after it has disrupted the BIOS state necessary for those services and ISRs to function properly.|$|R
