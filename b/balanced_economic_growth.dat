This provided a customs union, a common external tariff, currency, and postage. It also dealt with common services in transport and communications, research, and education. Following independence, these integrated activities were reconstituted and the EAHC {{was replaced by}} the EACSO, which many observers thought would lead to a political federation between the three territories. The new organisation ran into difficulties {{because of the lack of}} joint planning and fiscal policy, separate political policies, and Kenya's dominant economic position. In 1967, the EACSO was superseded by the EAC. This body aimed to strengthen the ties between the members through a common market, a common customs tariff, and a range of public services to achieve <b>balanced</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> within the region.|$|E

40|$|Lake {{eutrophication}} {{leading to}} water pollution {{is a major}} global concern. In recent years, rapid <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> {{and the increase in}} the intensity of resource exploitation in China have caused the influx of nitrogen and phosphorus into lakes. This in turn has led to more severe lake eutrophication, more frequent outbreaks of algal blooms, and the degradation of lake ecosystems. An effective plan <b>balancing</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> with the reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus emissions is greatly needed. The design and implementation of such a plan requires the collection and analysis of pertinent data. In this paper, we use the environmental computable general equilibrium (ECGE) model to identify {{the most effective way to}} <b>balance</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> with the reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus emissions. For the multiregional analysis, we use social accounting matrices (SAMs) and a provincial trade matrix based on the assumptions of the gravity model. We consider the Poyang Lake Watershed as a case study to illustrate the utility of the model. Based on present conditions in the Poyang Lake Watershed, restricting nitrogen and phosphorus emissions from sectors with the highest emissions is more effective for <b>balancing</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> and the reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus emissions than restricting nitrogen and phosphorus emissions from all sectors.

40|$|Facing the {{challenge}} of climate change, forecasts of energy demand and carbon emissions demand are a key requirement for India to ensure energy security and the <b>balance</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth.</b> The authors calculate the optimal <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> under the <b>balance</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> path from 2009 to 2050 in India based on the economy-carbon dynamic model. Combination of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 edition of the formula of carbon emissions, energy intensity model, and population model, it gets the carbon emissions demand caused by energy consumption for time span 1980 - 2008. Then, it estimates the energy consumption demand and carbon emissions demand under the <b>balance</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> path from 2009 to 2050. The {{results show that the}} cumulative amount of energy demand and carbon emissions demand in India for the time span 2009 to 2050, are 44. 65 Gtoe and 36. 16 Gt C, separately. The annual demand of energy consumption and carbon emissions for India show an inverted U curve from 2009 to 2050. The demand of energy consumption and carbon emissions will peak in 2045, and the peak values are 1290. 74 Mtoe and 1045. 98 Mt C.

50|$|Disproportionality theories. This {{idea was}} the basis for {{numerous}} Marxist crisis theories devised in the first three decades of the 20th century, most famously by Rudolf Hilferding, Rosa Luxemburg, Nikolai Bukharin, Otto Bauer, and Henryk Grossmann. The argument is that <b>balanced</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> is only a temporary phenomenon, because a private enterprise economy is incapable of sustaining the necessary proportionalities required. It cannot do so because there is no overall, conscious coordination of production activities in an economic system in which producers compete to cut costs, increase sales, and increase profits. There has been much dispute about which disproportionalities exactly are of decisive importance and why those specific disproportionalities would occur and recur, but all these theorists agree that some disproportionalities must necessarily occur, making recurrent crises inevitable.|$|E
5000|$|Marx's {{models of}} {{economic}} reproduction in capitalism {{have often been}} interpreted as stating the conditions for economic equilibrium, or <b>balanced</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth.</b> After all, there are certain [...] "necessary proportions" [...] between different branches of production, which have to adjust their output levels to each other. If those proportions do not reach a minimum acceptable level, then products remain unsold or producers cannot obtain the inputs they require, in which case production begins to slow down or break down. So there are necessary proportions between production, distribution, and consumption that must be maintained if society is to survive and grow. In this sense, Marx distinguishes between the production of means of production, consumer goods, and luxury goods, and he considers the commercial interactions between the sectors producing them.|$|E

5000|$|Monetary {{co-operation}} {{is closely}} related to economic integration, and are often considered to be reinforcing processes. However, economic integration is an economic arrangement between different regions, marked by the reduction or elimination of trade barriers and the coordination of monetary and fiscal policies, whereas monetary co-operation is focussed on currency linkages. A monetary union is considered to be the crowning step of a process of monetary co-operation and economic integration. In the form of monetary co-operation where two or more countries engage in a mutually beneficial exchange, capital among the countries involved is free to move, in contrast to capital controls. Monetary co-operation is considered to promote <b>balanced</b> <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> and monetary stability, but can also work counter-effectively if the member countries have (strongly) differing levels of economic development.
