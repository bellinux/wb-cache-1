25|$|Paul Langevin and von Laue {{showed that}} the twin paradox can be {{completely}} resolved by consideration of acceleration in special relativity. If two twins move away from each other, {{and one of them}} is accelerating and coming <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> then the accelerated twin is younger than the other one, since he was located in at least two inertial frames of reference, and therefore his assessment of which events are simultaneous changed during the acceleration. For the other twin nothing changes since he remained in a single frame.|$|E

The two universes began to clash in 1985, after Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) stole the parallel universe version of his son, Peter, following his own son's death. The finale's narrative recounts what happens when Peter (Joshua Jackson) is taken <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> Side by his real father, dubbed [...] "Walternate" [...] (Noble). FBI agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) and Walter lead a team of former Cortexiphan test subjects to retrieve him, after discovering that Peter is an unwitting part of Walternate's plans to bring about the destruction of our universe using an ancient doomsday device.|$|E

500|$|For {{months on}} end Jeannette hardly moved at all; De Long {{recorded}} on March 2 that their position was almost precisely {{what it had}} been three months earlier.

[...] The summer brought no relief; although it briefly seemed possible in August that Jeannette might break free and find open water, this proved a false hope. The condition of Danenhower was a further source of anxiety. His syphilis began to take toll of his body, particularly his left eye which, despite Ambler's repeated operations—stoically endured, given the lack of anesthetic—left the navigator largely incapacitated and unable to perform his duties. On the last day of 1880 De Long wrote in his journal: [...] "I begin the new year by turning over a new leaf, and I hope to God we are turning over a new leaf in our book of luck".|$|E
500|$|The episode, {{like the}} others in the series, was shot over eight days, with the 'May vs. May' fight being shot over three of those days—one 16-hour day, a half-day, and a quarter-day. In {{preparation}} for the fight, both Wen and her stunt double Samantha Jo had to learn both May and Agent 33's actions, with Jo explaining that [...] "Usually you only have to learn one side, so you can just drill that into your head and have that muscle memory and be good to go. But for this fight, for both Ming and myself, we had to learn both sides of the fight. And we knew on the day we were filming that we’d have to be changing our wardrobe back and forth. So we’d be going {{to one side of the}} fight, to the other side of the fight, <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side, and we just wanted to make sure we were safe about it. Because if we spaced out and started doing the other side again, we didn’t want anyone to get hurt. So that’s why we trained together. We were doing two sessions twice a week, anywhere from two to five hours at Ming’s house just trying to get as physically ready and as mentally ready as possible. But thankfully, we’d already done so many episodes together by that point that we were super comfortable, and we know each other’s body movements." ...|$|E
500|$|Rousseau {{makes her}} first {{appearance}} in the season one episode [...] "Solitary", where she captures Sayid (Naveen Andrews), one of the plane crash survivors. Rousseau tortures him until he eventually convinces her {{that he is not}} one of the Others. She allows Sayid to return to his camp, and cautions him to keep a close eye on the other survivors. Over two weeks later, she comes across a delirious Claire (Emilie de Ravin), who had been left in the jungle after being kidnapped by the Others. Noticing that Claire's shouting is alerting the Others to her presence, Rousseau knocks her unconscious and carries her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> survivors. Rousseau makes her next appearance in [...] "Numbers", where she shoots at Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) and Hurley (Jorge Garcia), suspecting them of being Others. In the season one finale, set 43 days after the plane crash, Rousseau arrives on the beach and warns everyone that the Others are coming. After Claire gives birth to her son Aaron, Rousseau steals him and intends to swap him for her own child. When the Others do not come, Rousseau reluctantly returns him to Sayid. In season two, set two weeks later, Rousseau informs Sayid that she has caught one of the Others, who later turns out to be Ben. Later, Rousseau joins Claire and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) who are searching for medicine for Claire's baby, in one of the Others' work stations. Disappointed that she has not found any trace of Alex, she begins to leave them when Claire tells her that she believes Alex helped her escape when the Others captured her.|$|E

[...] In the Woodward Stakes at Saratoga on September 1, he finished second by a neck, having been pushed toward the outside of the track by the winner, To Honor and Serve, in the final furlong.

500|$|The {{survivors}} {{split up}} {{into two groups}} {{to head to the}} Others' camp.

Sayid plans to use black smoke as a signal, saying that [...] "this time, they will know that we are coming", a reference to the attacks in the first-season finale. When the boat reaches the Others' camp, Sayid finds it to be deserted. Meanwhile, Michael, Jack, Sawyer, Hurley and Kate engage in a gun battle with some Others that were following them, and Sawyer kills one. Jack confronts Michael about leading the group into a trap, and Michael confesses to the murders of Ana Lucia and Libby. They realize that Michael has led them to a location other than the beach, ruining their former plan to meet up with Sayid. There, they see a large pile of pneumatic tubes, suggesting that the reports sent out from the [...] discovered in the episode [...] "?" [...] had never been read. Shortly after the discovery of the tube pile, they hear whispers, and suddenly Sawyer, Kate, and Jack are incapacitated by electric darts. The hostages, bound and gagged, are brought to a dock, where it appears that the Others are led by Henry Gale (Michael Emerson). Gale keeps his bargain with Michael, returning his son, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), to him and giving them an old fishing boat with instructions to sail on a heading of 325 degrees until they are rescued. Michael threatens Henry that he could tell the outside world of the island's location. Henry responds by telling him that it wouldn't matter as they {{would not be able to}} find the island, should they return. He also gives Michael a counter-threat: if he did tell people of the island's location, people would know what he did to get his son back. Michael reluctantly accepts but asks who Henry and his people are, to which Henry responds [...] "We're the good guys, Michael". Michael uses the boat to get him and Walt off the island. Hurley is then released and sent <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> survivors with a message that they are to stay away from the Others' part of the island. As Hurley is let go, the other three captives are taken away.|$|E
