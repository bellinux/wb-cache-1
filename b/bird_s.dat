An exception to this general rule was the life span of those lice on feathers of the lesser road-runner. Five of the ten lice used lived three weeks or longer. A few eggs and larvae were observed on feathers of the ground dove, whitefronted parrot, and road-runner. Lice on the pigeon feathers lived, the eggs hatched, and the larvae developed. Mating was observed frequently. It appears that even when lice can adjust to feathers other than those of the pigeon, reproduction is curtailed...|$|E
40|$|A 25 -ha islet {{occupied}} by seasonally nesting sea birds, feral rabbits, and house mice is considered. Rabbits presumably modified the unknown original vegetation in their 70 {{or more years}} {{on the island and}} reached an equilibrium with a plant cover composed largely of a few hard y introduced grasses. A total of 28 species of higher plants has been recorded from the island, only 6 of which are native to Hawaii. Rabbits occur in low to moderate numbers, sustained by a food source that is enriched by bird guano and subject to annual drought. Average body weight of the mouse is remarkably heavy at 19. 5 g. Data on biological and food habits are presented for both mammals. Among 13 species of ectoparasites of birds and mammals are two unusual host adaptations : of the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis felis, to Oryctolagns cuniculus, and of the Oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, to Mus musculus. Rabbits appear not to be detrimental to the nesting of <b>bird</b> <b>s,</b> and their control or extermination is discouraged at present.

The albatross s remarkable ease in the air and its huge wingspan strikes all those who observe them, and the huge journeys they undertake across the oceans inspires awe. The bird has been celebrated through proverbs, folk stories, art, and ceremony. For many, the bird 2 ̆ 7 s cultural significance is still determined by Coleridge 2 ̆ 7 s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. People have engaged with the bird over the last two centuries, from those who sought to exploit them to those who devoted their lives to them. Writers, artists and documentary makers have all focused on the albatross and its place in the human imagination has been demonstrated throughout history. The book concludes with a consideration of the <b>bird</b> <b>s</b> changing significance in the modern world, as well as threats to its continued existence and its prospects for the future...|$|E

40|$|Western Africa has a {{very diverse}} ecology, history, and {{socioeconomic}} setting. In Land Tenure and Resource Access in West Africa, the region is therefore divided in four subareas: Gulf of Guinea (from Cote d Ivoire to Cameroon), Land-locked Sahel (from Mali to Chad), Atlantic Sahel (Senegal, Gambia, and Mauritania), and Atlantic Forest (stretching from Guinea Bissau to Liberia). The book describes the characteristic developments of each region and their likely evolution over the next 25 years. Recent decades have brought many changes (urban growth, population increase, migration), and new markets and technologies, which haves exerted significant pressures on land. The report discusses key policy areas like the usefulness of recognising customary tenure systems and implementing land registration, mechanisms for conflict resolution, decentralisation, and good governance. With its <b>bird</b> <b>s</b> eye view, {{the book is a}} reasonable introduction to these urgent policy areas to be addressed by governments, donors, and civil society.

40|$|MOLOKAI, {{the fifth}} {{largest of the}} Hawaiian Islands, is 38 miles long and about 10 miles wide. Its eastern half is high land running up to almost 5, 000 feet in height. Some rather ex-tensive areas of native forest still remain on the upper slopes, but {{introduced}} plants have dis-placed the native growth over large areas. In spite of the large area {{and the amount of}} cover, the rather intensive observations of the Ha-waiian Bird Survey from 1935 to 1937 resulted in only a single record (Munro, 1944 : 96) of a native land species on Molokai-s-the apapane (Himatione sangtJinea). The survey covered large "areas of native forest, chiefly in the east-central part of the island, where endemic <b>bird</b> <b>s</b> had once been abundant. Munro thought he heard the song of the Molokai thrush (Phaeornis obscura rutha) in 1936 but was not certain. Richards (1946 : 29) probably saw amakihis (Chlorodrepanis virens wilsoni), but this too is uncertain. Bryan (1908) was apparently the last ornithologist to observe and collect various native birds that have since become extinct or nearly extinct. He saw Perkins ' mamo (Dre-panis funerea), the crested honeyeater (Pal-meria dolei), the Molokai creeper (Paroreomyz« maculata [lamm ea), and other native birds. Cer-tain species, such as the ou (Psittacirostra psittacea) and the 00 (A cralocercas bishopi), were almost certainly extinct even then. The survey of 1935 - 1937 appeared to indi-cate that nearly all native birds formerly found on Molokai were extinct. However, the survey did not cover certain parts of the island, espe...|$|E
40|$|Not nocuous {{bacteria}} {{are important for}} the maturation and the modulating activity of the gut immune system. However, the humoral immune response against commensal and probiotic bacteria is less documented, particularly in farmhouse animals. Blood serum and saliva were collected in two trials where probiotics, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LbR), well-defined human isolate (Trial A), and a novel and abundant porcine commensal, Lactobacillus sobrius strain 001 T (LbS) (Trial B), were supplemented to weaning pigs. Anti-LbR IgA were present in serum of pigs before treatment with LbR, but also after 1 or 2 weeks in control pigs, notwithstanding the absence of DNA from LbR in colon. Pigs fed or not LbS for 1 or 2 weeks had LbS-specific IgA, in saliva and in serum. Colon contents of control subjects were positive for DNA from LbS. We hypothesized that part of this IgA strain-specific activity is partially related to immune cross-reactivity between different Lactobacillus-species. With the procedure of Shu et al. [Shu, Q., <b>Bird,</b> <b>S.</b> H., Gill, H. S., Rowe, J. B., 1999. Immunological cross-reactivity between the vaccine and other isolates of Streptococcus bovis and Lactobacillus. FEMS Immunol. Med.
