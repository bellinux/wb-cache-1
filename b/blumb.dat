60|$|Our bore, in {{a similar}} manner, being in Italy, made a {{discovery}} of a dreadful picture, {{which has been the}} terror of {{a large portion of the}} civilized world ever since. We have seen the liveliest men paralysed by it, across a broad dining-table. He was lounging among the mountains, sir, basking in the mellow influences of the climate, when he came to UNA PICCOLA CHIESA - a little church - or perhaps it would be more correct to say UNA PICCOLISSIMA CAPPELLA - the smallest chapel you can possibly imagine - and walked in. There was nobody inside but a CIECO - a blind man - saying his prayers, and a VECCHIO PADRE - old friar-rattling a money-box. But, above the head of that friar, and immediately to the right of the altar as you enter - to the right of the altar? No. To the left of the altar as you enter - or say near the centre - there hung a painting (subject, Virgin and Child) so divine in its expression, so pure and yet so warm and rich in its tone, so fresh in its touch, at once so glowing in its colour and so statuesque in its repose, that our bore cried out in ecstasy, 'That's the finest picture in Italy!' And so it is, sir. There is no doubt of it. It is astonishing that that picture is so little known. Even the painter is uncertain. He afterwards took <b>Blumb,</b> of the Royal Academy (it is to be observed that our bore takes none but eminent people to see sights, and that none but eminent people take our bore), and you never saw a man so affected in your life as <b>Blumb</b> was. He cried like a child! And then our bore begins his description in detail - for all this is introductory - and strangles his hearers with the folds of the purple drapery.|$|E
40|$|Always {{eager to}} plunge into books with {{enticing}} epigraphs (such as Archibald MacLeish 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 A world ends when its metaphor has died 2 ̆ 2), I was not disappointed with Brackman and Dwigans 2 ̆ 7 s Backyard Visionaries. Beautifully illustrated, {{it not only}} documents, with excellent notes, a kind of 2 ̆ 2 visionary 2 ̆ 2 art, much of which exists on site rather than in museums, but also highlights model preservation efforts by the Kansas Grassroots Art Association (KGAA) of historically significant outsider art. Elizabeth Broun 2 ̆ 7 s illuminating introduction states that this art, first coined 2 ̆ 2 outsider 2 ̆ 2 art in 1972, has found an 2 ̆ 2 exceptional environment throughout the Midwest 2 ̆ 2 since the late 2 ̆ 760 s and early 2 ̆ 770 s and 2 ̆ 2 seems region specific. 2 ̆ 2 Introduced to 2 ̆ 2 outsider 2 ̆ 2 art at a North Platte, Nebraska, gallery, I experienced firsthand Emery Blagdon 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 healing machines 2 ̆ 2 and am delighted with their inclusion in this survey. A 1994 exhibition at the Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery convinced me that these art works continue to convey the wonder of that initial encounter. Editors Brackman and Dwigans have assembled stunning photographs-many in color-focusing on 2 ̆ 2 grassroots art in the Midwest, 2 ̆ 2 specifically Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Oklahoma. Essays are by thirteen KGAA members-Carl Magnuson, Gregg Blagsdel, Barbara Brackman, John Hackmeister, Lisa Stone, Jim Zanzi, Earl Iversen, Jim McCrary, Jon <b>Blumb,</b> Dan Dryden, Don Christensen, Cathy Dwigans, and Ray Wilber-all well- qualified to provide insight into this body of work variously referred to as self-taught, naive, outsider, folk, spiritual, or visionary-as the book 2 ̆ 7 s title implies. Books that are useful, that show visually where the 2 ̆ 2 stuff 2 ̆ 7 was created, as this one does, and incorporate telling quotes from knowledgeable sources {{to connect with the}} work, are valuable resources for the casual reader as well as museum personnel. Backyard Visionaries is clearly one of those. Each author explores significant regional connections, but often within the context of such larger issues as Social Darwinism, the Populist movement, art brut, and contemporary art. The various historical perspectives from which they attempt to 2 ̆ 2 classify 2 ̆ 2 the unique creations of Ed Root, Dave Woods, Charles Koester, Elsie Quigley, Father Mathias, Paul and Matilda Wegner, Samuel P. Dinsmore, Father P. M. Dobberstein, Claude Melton, Emery Blagdon, Ed Galloway, as well as regional quilters, egg decorators, and saddle makers, amplify our appreciation and understanding of these remarkable 2 ̆ 2 visionaries. 2 ̆ 2 Ultimately, each author offers a strong case for the same innate, intuitively compulsive human characteristics behind creation and the making of aesthetic decisions regardless of whether an artist is designated as 2 ̆ 2 fine 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 outsider. 2 ̆...|$|E
