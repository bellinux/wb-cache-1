Cologuard also looks for aberrant methylation in the promoter regions of the ‘’NDRG4’’ gene (N-Myc Downstream-Regulated Gene 4) and ‘’BMP3’’ gene (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 3 gene), which are hypermethylated in colorectal cancer, as well as hemoglobin. Another DNA marker, the human <b>beta-actin</b> gene, acts as a reference gene and a measure of total human DNA.

This ribozyme was identified from in vitro studies that showed that the Vg1 mRNA was cleaved within the 3' UTR {{in the absence of}} protein. Studying the Vg1 mRNA 3'UTR a manganese-dependent ribozyme was predicted to exist. This ribozyme was shown to be located adjacent to the polyadenylation site and in vitro studies showed that it catalyzes a first-order reaction where its mechanism of cleavage is similar to the manganese ribozyme present in Tetrahymena group I introns.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes {{a family}} member of actin-related {{proteins}} (ARPs), which share significant amino acid sequence identity to conventional actins. Both actins and ARPs have an actin fold, which is an ATP-binding cleft, as a common feature. The ARPs are involved in diverse cellular processes, including vesicular transport, spindle orientation, nuclear migration and chromatin remodeling. This gene encodes a 53 kDa subunit protein of the BAF (BRG1/brm-associated factor) complex in mammals, which is functionally related to SWI/SNF complex in S. cerevisiae and Drosophila; the latter is thought to facilitate transcriptional activation of specific genes by antagonizing chromatin-mediated transcriptional repression. Together with <b>beta-actin,</b> it is required for maximal ATPase activity of BRG1, and for the association of the BAF complex with chromatin/matrix. Three transcript variants that encode two different protein isoforms have been described.|$|E
5000|$|... mRNA {{localization}} {{is critical}} for regulation of gene expression by allowing spatially regulated protein production. Through mRNA localization proteins are transcribed in their intended target site of the cell. This is especially important during early development when rapid cell cleavages give different cells various combinations of mRNA which can then lead to drastically different cell fates. RBPs are critical in the localization of this mRNA that insures proteins are only transcribed in their intended regions. One of these proteins is ZBP1. ZBP1 binds to <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA {{at the site of}} transcription and moves with mRNA into the cytoplasm. It then localizes this mRNA to the lamella region of several asymmetric cell types where it can then be translated. FMRP is another RBP involved in RNA localization. It was shown that in addition to other functions for FMRP in RNA metabolism, FMRP is involved in the stimulus-induced localization of several dendritic mRNAs in neuronal dendrites.|$|E

50|$|The PDIA3 {{protein is}} a thiol {{oxidoreductase}} that has protein disulfide isomerase activity. PDIA3 {{is also part}} of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I peptide loading complex, which is essential for formation of the final antigen conformation and export from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. This protein of the endoplasmic reticulum interacts with lectin chaperones such as calreticulin and CNX in order to modulate the folding of proteins that are newly synthesized. It is believed that PDIA3 plays a role in protein folding by promoting the formation of disulfide bonds, and that CNX facilitates the positioning substrates next to the catalytic cysteines. This function allows it to serve as a redox sensor by activating mTORC1, which then mediates mTOR complex assembly to adapt cells to oxidative damage. Thus, PDIA3 regulates cell growth and death according to oxygen concentrations, such as in the hypoxic microenvironment of bones. Additionally, PDIA3 activates cell anchorage in bones by associating with cell division and cytoskeleton proteins, such as <b>beta-actin</b> and vimentin, to form a complex which controls TUBB3 folding and proper attachment of the microtubules to the kinetochore. PDIA3 also plays a role in cytokine-dependent signal transduction, including STAT3 signaling.|$|E
5000|$|CRD-BP and its {{orthologs}} {{have been}} shown {{to have the ability to}} bind CD44, <b>beta-actin,</b> c-myc, IGF2, H19 and tau RNA transcripts. CRD-BP has been shown to play a crucial role in cancer growth and invasion of tissues. CD44 proteins belong to a family of cell surface adhesion molecules that are involved in both cell-cell and cell-matrix communications. CRD-BP binds to and protects CD44 RNA which shows increased expression in cancers. CRD-BP plays a role in the localization of β-actin mRNA by binding to the localization element in the 3'UTR region. [...] Aberrant expression of the oncogenic c-myc gene has been shown in the formation of tumours. [...] c-myc mRNA contains a coding region instability determinant (CRD) which CRD-BP has been shown to bind, therefore, protecting c-myc mRNA from endonucleolytic attack. CRD-BP also binds IGF2 and H19 mRNA. The H19 gene is located downstream of the IGF2 on chromosome 11 and chromosome 7 on humans and mice, respectively. The binding of CRD-BP to these transcripts has shown to alter the expression of the genes. The microtubule-associated protein (MAP) is coded for by tau mRNA and is mainly found in the axon of neurons. The 3’UTR of tau mRNA contains a cis-regulatory element that controls the axonal localization of tau mRNA. [...] CRD-BP binds to the axonal localization signal (ALS) of tau and plays a role in the localization of the transcript.|$|E

40|$|The {{functions}} of actin family members during development are poorly understood. To investigate {{the role of}} <b>beta-actin</b> in mammalian development, a <b>beta-actin</b> knockout mouse model was used. Homozygous <b>beta-actin</b> knockout mice are lethal at embryonic day (E) 10. 5. At E 10. 25 <b>beta-actin</b> knockout embryos are growth retarded and display a pale yolk sac and embryo proper that is suggestive of altered erythropoiesis. Here we report that lack of <b>beta-actin</b> resulted in a block of primitive and definitive hematopoietic development. Reduced levels of Gata 2, were associated to this phenotype. Consistently, ChIP analysis revealed multiple binding sites for <b>beta-actin</b> in the Gata 2 promoter. Gata 2 mRNA levels were almost completely rescued by expression of an erythroid lineage restricted ROSA 26 -promotor based GATA 2 transgene. As a result, erythroid differentiation was restored and the knockout embryos showed significant improvement in yolk sac and embryo vascularization. These results provide new molecular insights for a novel function of <b>beta-actin</b> in erythropoiesis by modulating the expression levels of Gata 2 in vivo. © 2013 Tondeleir et al.

The normal rate of total actin synthesis could be restored in some clones of cells following transfection of the functional <b>beta-actin</b> gene but not following transfection of the functional gamma-actin gene. In gamma-actin gene-transfected substrains that have increased rates of gamma-actin synthesis, <b>beta-actin</b> synthesis is further reduced {{in a manner consistent with}} an autoregulatory mechanism, resulting in abnormal ratios of actin isoforms. Thus, both beta- and gamma-actin proteins can apparently regulate the synthesis of their coexpressed isoforms. In addition, decreased synthesis of normal <b>beta-actin</b> seems to correlate with a concomitant down-regulation of tropomyosin isoforms...|$|E
40|$|Localization of <b>beta-actin</b> {{messenger}} RNA {{to sites}} of active actin polymerization modulates cell migration during embryogenesis, differentiation and possibly carcinogenesis. This localization requires the oncofetal protein ZBP 1 (Zipcode binding protein 1), which binds to a conserved 54 -nucleotide {{element in the}} 32 ̆ 7 -untranslated region of the <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA known as the 2 ̆ 7 zipcode 2 ̆ 7. ZBP 1 promotes translocation of the <b>beta-actin</b> transcript to actin-rich protrusions in primary fibroblasts and neurons. It is not known how the ZBP 1 -RNA complex achieves asymmetric protein sorting by localizing <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA. Here we show that chicken ZBP 1 modulates the translation of <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA. ZBP 1 associates with the <b>beta-actin</b> transcript in the nucleus and prevents premature translation in the cytoplasm by blocking translation initiation. Translation only occurs when the ZBP 1 -RNA complex reaches its destination at {{the periphery of the}} cell. At the endpoint of mRNA transport, the protein kinase Src promotes translation by phosphorylating a key tyrosine residue in ZBP 1 that is required for binding to RNA. These sequential events provide both temporal and spatial control over <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA translation, which is important for cell migration and neurite outgrowth...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} of mRNAs into developing dendrites and axons {{may be a}} basic mechanism to localize cytoskeletal proteins to growth cones and influence microfilament organization. Using isoform-specific antibodies and probes for in situ hybridization, we observed distinct localization patterns for beta- and gamma-actin within cultured cerebrocortical neurons. <b>beta-Actin</b> protein was highly enriched within growth cones and filopodia, in contrast to gamma-actin protein, which was distributed uniformly throughout the cell. <b>beta-Actin</b> protein also was shown to be peripherally localized after transfection of <b>beta-actin</b> cDNA bearing an epitope tag. <b>beta-Actin</b> mRNAs were localized more frequently to neuronal processes and growth cones, unlike gamma-actin mRNAs, which were restricted to the cell body. The rapid localization of <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA, but not gamma-actin mRNA, into processes and growth cones could be induced by dibutyryl cAMP treatment. Using high-resolution in situ hybridization and image-processing methods, we showed that the distribution of <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA within growth cones was statistically nonrandom and demonstrated an association with microtubules. <b>beta-Actin</b> mRNAs were detected within minor neurites, axonal processes, and growth cones {{in the form of}} spatially distinct granules that colocalized with translational components. Ultrastructural analysis revealed polyribosomes within growth cones that colocalized with cytoskeletal filaments. The {{transport of}} <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA into developing neurites may be a sequence-specific mechanism to synthesize cytoskeletal proteins directly within processes and growth cones and would provide an additional means to deliver cytoskeletal proteins over long distances...|$|E
40|$|A {{recombinant}} phage {{that carries}} the cytoplasmic <b>beta-actin</b> gene was isolated from a human DNA library. The nucleotide sequence of this gene was determined. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence matches perfectly that of <b>beta-actin</b> from human fibroblasts. The gene contains five introns. A large intron {{was found in the}} 5 ' untranslated region six nucleotides upstream from the ATG initiation codon. Four introns were found within the coding region at codons specifying amino acids 41 / 42, 121 / 122, 267, and 327 / 328. In contrast to the human cardiac muscle actin gene, the aorta-type smooth muscle actin gene, and the stomach-type smooth muscle actin gene, the <b>beta-actin</b> gene lacks the codon for cysteine between the ATG initiation codon and the codon for the NH 2 -terminal amino acid of the mature protein. Hybridization of genomic DNA with DNA fragments derived from intron I in the 5 ' untranslated region and from intron III strongly suggests the presence of a single <b>beta-actin</b> gene in the human genome. The DNA sequences of the coding region, of the 3 ' untranslated region, and of the sequence block between the "CCAAT" box and "TATA" box in the 5 ' flanking DNA of the human <b>beta-actin</b> gene are highly homologous to the corresponding sequences of the rat and chicken <b>beta-actin</b> genes. Unexpectedly, the sequence of intron III of the human <b>beta-actin</b> gene shows considerable homology to that of the rat <b>beta-actin</b> gene...|$|E
40|$|In chicken embryo {{fibroblasts}} (CEFs), <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA localizes near an actin-rich {{region of}} cytoplasm specialized for motility, the lamellipodia. This localization is mediated by isoform-specific 32 ̆ 7 -untranslated sequences (zipcodes) {{and can be}} inhibited by antizipcode oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) (Kislauskis, E. H., X. -C. Zhu, and R. H. Singer. 1994. J. Cell Biol. 127 : 441 - 451). This inhibition of <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA localization resulted in the disruption of fibroblast polarity and, presumably, cell motility. To investigate the role of <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA in motility, we correlated time-lapse images of moving CEFs with the distribution of <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA in these cells. CEFs with localized <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA moved significantly further over {{the same time period}} than did CEFs with nonlocalized mRNA. Antizipcode ODN treatment reduced this cell translocation while control ODN treatments showed no effect. The temporal relationship of <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA localization to cell translocation was investigated using serum addition to serum-deprived cultures. <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA was not localized in serum-deprived cells but became localized within minutes after serum addition (Latham, V. M., E. H. Kislauskis, R. H. Singer, and A. F. Ross. 1994. J. Cell Biol. 126 : 1211 - 1219). Cell translocation increased over the next 90 min, and actin synthesis likewise increased. Puromycin reduced this cell translocation and blocked this induction in cytosolic actin content. The serum induction of cell movement was also inhibited by antizipcode ODNs. These observations support the hypothesis that <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA localization and consequent protein synthesis augment cell motility...|$|E
40|$|Mutant human <b>beta-actin</b> genes were {{introduced}} into normal human (KD) fibroblasts and the derivative cell line HuT- 12, which is immortalized but nontumorigenic, {{to test their}} ability to promote conversion to the tumorigenic state. Transfected substrains of HuT- 12 fibroblasts that expressed abundant levels of mutant <b>beta-actin</b> (Gly- 244 [...] Asp- 244) produced subcutaneous tumors in athymic mice after long latent periods (1. 5 to 3 months). However, transfected substrains of KD fibroblasts retained their normal finite life span in culture and consequently were incapable of producing tumors. Substrains of HuT- 12 cells transfected with the wild-type <b>beta-actin</b> gene and some transfected strains that expressed low or undetectable levels of mutant <b>beta-actin</b> did not produce tumors. Cell lines derived from transfectant cell tumors always exhibited elevated synthesis of the mutant <b>beta-actin,</b> ranging from 145 to 476 % of the level expressed by the transfected cells that were inoculated to form the tumor. In general, primary transfectant cells that expressed {{the highest levels of}} mutant <b>beta-actin</b> were more tumorigenic than strains that expressed lower levels. The tumor-derived strains were stable in tumorigenicity and produced tumors with shortened latent periods of only 2 to 4 weeks. These findings imply that the primary transfectant strains develop subpopulations of cells that are selected to form tumors because of their elevated rate of exogenous mutant <b>beta-actin</b> synthesis. Actin synthesis and accumulation of gamma-actin mRNA from the endogenous beta- and gamma-actin genes were diminished in tumor-derived strains, apparently to compensate for elevated mutant <b>beta-actin</b> synthesis and maintain the normal cellular concentration of actin. Synthesis of the transformation-sensitive tropomyosin isoforms was decreased along with mutant <b>beta-actin</b> expression. Such modulations in tropomyosin synthesis are characteristically seen in transformation of avian, rodent, and human fibroblasts. Our results suggest that this mutant <b>beta-actin</b> contributes to the neoplastic phenotype of immortalized human fibroblasts by imposing a cytoarchitectural defect and inducing abnormal expression of cytoskeletal tropomyosins...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} mutant human <b>beta-actin</b> genes {{have been}} introduced into normal diploid human (KD) fibroblasts and their immortalized derivative cell line, HuT- 12, {{to assess the impact}} of an abnormal cytoskeletal protein on cellular phenotypes such as morphology, growth characteristics, and properties relating to the neoplastic phenotype. A mutant <b>beta-actin</b> containing a single mutation (Gly- 244 [...] Asp- 244) was stable and was incorporated into cytoskeletal stress fibers. Transfected KD cells which expressed the stable mutant <b>beta-actin</b> in excess of normal <b>beta-actin</b> were morphologically altered. In contrast, a second mutant <b>beta-actin</b> gene containing two additional mutations (Gly- 36 [...] Glu- 36 and Glu- 83 [...] Asp- 83, as well as Gly- 244 [...] Asp- 244) did not alter cell morphology when expressed at high levels in transfected cells, but the protein was labile and did not accumulate in stress fibers. In both KD and HuT- 12 cells, endogenous beta- and gamma-actin decreased in response to high-level expression of the stable mutant <b>beta-actin,</b> in a manner consistent with autoregulatory feedback of actin concentrations. Since the percent decreases in the endogenous beta- and gamma-actins were equal, the ratio of net <b>beta-actin</b> (mutant plus normal) to gamma-actin was significantly increased in the transfected cells. Antisera capable of distinguishing the mutant from the normal epitope revealed that the mutant <b>beta-actin</b> accumulated in stress fibers but did not participate in the formation of the actin filament-rich perinuclear network. These observations suggest that different intracellular locations differentially incorporate actin into cytoskeletal microfilaments. The dramatic impact on cell morphology and on beta-actin/gamma-actin ratios in the transfected diploid KD cells may be related to the acquisition of some of the characteristics of cells that underwent the neoplastic transformation event that originally led to the appearance of the <b>beta-actin</b> mutations...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: In gene {{expression}} studies, endogenous controls that are constitutively expressed (housekeeping genes) {{are commonly used}} to normalize for variations in cDNA synthesis efficiency. In the present study, a frequently used control gene, <b>beta-actin,</b> was examined in ovine heart valves to evaluate its applicability as a housekeeping gene for this tissue. METHODS: Interstitial cells (IC) of the four heart valves were isolated using the outgrowth explant method. Cells were cultured under different serum conditions (10 % or 20 % fetal bovine serum or 20 % sheep serum) up to passage (P) 5. mRNA from fresh tissue and from cells at P 0 and P 5 was isolated, and expression of <b>beta-actin</b> determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). An identical control sample was used for each PCR and each gel electrophoresis. Data were expressed as a relative value of this control sample. RESULTS: <b>beta-Actin</b> expression in the aortic valve was significantly lower than in other valves. The mRNA level of <b>beta-actin</b> was four-fold lower in freshly isolated IC than in cultured IC. Once up-regulated by in-vitro culturing conditions, <b>beta-actin</b> expression did not change from P 0 to P 5. An important increase in the variation of <b>beta-actin</b> expression was observed in cultured cells as compared to fresh cells.

40|$|<b>Beta-actin</b> mRNA is {{localized}} in {{the leading}} lamellae of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) (Lawrence, J., and R. Singer. 1986. Cell. 45 : 407 - 415), {{close to where}} actin polymerization in the lamellipodia drives cellular motility. During serum starvation <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA becomes diffuse and non-localized. Addition of FCS induces a rapid (within 2 - 5 min) redistribution of <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA into the leading lamellae. A similar redistribution was seen with PDGF, a fibroblast chemotactic factor. PDGF-induced <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA redistribution was inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin, indicating that this process requires intact tyrosine kinase activity, similar to actin filament polymerization and chemotaxis. Lysophosphatidic acid, which {{has been shown to}} rapidly induce actin stress fiber formation (Ridley, A., and A. Hall. 1992. Cell. 790 : 389 - 399), also increases peripheral <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA localization within minutes. This suggests that actin polymerization and mRNA localization may be regulated by similar signaling pathways. Additionally, activators or inhibitors of kinase A or C can also delocalize steady-state <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA in cells grown in serum, and can inhibit the serum induction of peripherally localized <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA in serum-starved CEFs.

These alterations were concomitant with a fivefold reduction in type II collagen mRNA and a cessation in its protein production. After fibronectin and actin mRNAs and proteins reached their maximal levels, type I collagen mRNA and protein synthesis were turned on. Removal of PMA resulted in reduced <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA levels in chondrocytes and in a further alteration in the cell morphology. These observed correlations between changes in cell adhesion and morphology and <b>beta-actin</b> expression suggest {{that the effect of}} PMA on cell shape and adhesion may result in changes in the microfilament organization of the cytoskeleton which ultimately lead to changes in the extracellular matrix produced by the cells...|$|E
40|$|In {{an earlier}} report, {{evidence}} was presented that the down-regulation of <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA during myogenesis {{was controlled by}} a region 3 ' to the promoter of the gene. In this paper we report the location of this regulatory sequence, determined by deletion analysis {{and the use of}} chimeric genes, transfected stably into the mouse myogenic cell line C 2 C 12. The domain responsible for the reduction in <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA levels is at most 40 base pairs long and is located just 5 ' to the canonical polyadenylylation signal in the gene. Placement of this sequence in the corresponding 3 ' position both in the alpha-cardiac-actin gene and in the neomycin-resistance gene in pSV 2 -neo confers the <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA regulatory pattern when these constructs are stably introduced into C 2 C 12 cells. Nuclear run-on experiments indicate that transcriptional control can account for the decrease observed in <b>beta-actin</b> mRNA levels during myogenesis for both the endogenous as well as the transfected <b>beta-actin</b> gene constructs. This 3 ' transcriptional control sequence is conserved in all of the vertebrate <b>beta-actin</b> genes sequenced and is not similar to any of the 3 ' processing-adenylylation or termination sequences described previously. This mode of gene regulation may reflect a more general mechanism involved in the process of gene suppression during development...|$|E
