5|$|Helvellyn may be {{included}} in a traverse of the full length of the Helvellyn range in either direction, but with a greater sense of climax when starting from the north. Most of the ridge track is a bridleway and so the route can be completed by mountain bike in a challenging six-hour circular route of 16 miles off-road and 10 miles on-road riding. This may <b>begin</b> (<b>and</b> finish) at Mill Bridge near Grasmere.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} Sanskrit term {{is composed}} of two letters, {{the first and the}} last of the Sanskrit alphabet. Together, they symbolically represent the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> the end of all things. In Japanese Mikkyō Buddhism, the letters represent the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> the end of the universe. [...] This appears in Greek as Alpha-Omega, similarly adopted by Christianity to symbolize Christ as the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> end of all.|$|R

5|$|A.P. Hill has {{received}} some criticism for his ineffective performance. His actions caused {{the battle to}} <b>begin</b> <b>and</b> then escalate on July 1, despite Lee's orders not to bring on a general engagement (although historians point out that Hill kept Lee well informed of his actions during the day). However, Hill's illness minimized his personal involvement {{in the remainder of}} the battle, and Lee took the explicit step of temporarily removing troops from Hill's corps and giving them to Longstreet for Pickett's Charge.|$|E

5|$|Industrialized {{societies}} generally {{follow a}} clock-based schedule for daily activities {{that do not}} change {{throughout the course of}} the year. The time of day that individuals <b>begin</b> <b>and</b> end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of the tropics daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the further one moves away from the tropics.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{together}} with the future historian A. J. P. Taylor, Driberg formed {{the membership of the}} Oxford University Communist Party. During the General Strike of May 1926, most Oxford students supported the government and enrolled as special constables and strike-breakers. A minority, which included the future Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell and the future Poet Laureate John Betjeman, sided with the strikers, while Driberg and Taylor offered their services at the British Communist Party's headquarters in London. The Party showed no urgency to employ them, and Taylor soon left. Driberg, given a job distributing strike bulletins, was arrested by the police before he could <b>begin</b> <b>and</b> was detained for several hours. This ended his active role in the strike. Notwithstanding his extreme left-wing associations, he secured 75 votes (against the winner's 152) in the 1927 elections for the presidency of the Oxford Union.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{nevertheless}} obtained {{an injunction}} from a Virginia court {{to allow him}} to participate in the game, which was being held in Louisiana. In response, the NCAA threatened to remove the Independence Bowl's certification if Smith was allowed to play. When the bowl forbade Smith from participating, he obtained a restraining order from a Louisiana court to force the Independence Bowl {{to allow him to}} play. On the day of the game, the NCAA attempted to appeal the decision to the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeals, but a three-judge panel denied the appeal. By this time, the game was about to <b>begin,</b> <b>and</b> Smith was allowed to play.|$|E
30|$|The {{knowledge}} of the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> end of each curve (different numbers for each measurement as implied below) led to {{the determination of the}} <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> end number for each curve and measurement. Thereafter by simply averaging the velocities within the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> end number we calculated the mean velocity (apparently for each curve and measurement). It is noted that the velocity of each measurement at the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> end of each curve was calculated with linear regression of the values right before and right after the curve implying that the trajectory and hence the variation of the velocity between two consecutive points, is linear.|$|R
50|$|In 1839, {{construction}} of the first courthouse was <b>begun</b> <b>and</b> completed in 1840. In 1871, {{construction of}} a second courthouse <b>began</b> <b>and</b> on August 4, 1914, the third courthouse was completed which is still presently used as such.|$|R
30|$|Two {{research}} questions guided this study: (1) Is district Pre-K attendance {{associated with a}} significant difference in letter–sound identification and word identification during the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> middle of first grade? (2) Is district Pre-K attendance associated with {{a significant difference in}} text-level reading ability during the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> middle of first grade? It was hypothesized that literacy achievement among Pre-K attendees would be higher during the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> middle of first grade, compared to the no-preschool group, for each literacy measure administered.|$|R
5|$|The peak random write {{performance}} on an SSD {{is driven by}} plenty of free blocks after the SSD is completely garbage collected, secure erased, 100% TRIMed, or newly installed. The maximum speed will depend upon the number of parallel flash channels connected to the SSD controller, {{the efficiency of the}} firmware, and the speed of the flash memory in writing to a page. During this phase the write amplification will be the best it can ever be for random writes and will be approaching one. Once the blocks are all written once, garbage collection will <b>begin</b> <b>and</b> the performance will be gated by the speed and efficiency of that process. Write amplification in this phase will increase to the highest levels the drive will experience.|$|E
5|$|While Meir and the Israeli Labor Party won the {{elections}} held in late-December, {{the release of}} the Agranat Commission's findings in April 1974 and its failure to accuse the nation's political leadership of any shortcomings—while recommending the dismissal of several senior officers—led to widespread public outrage. Meir resigned in response to public criticism, but Dayan remained steadfast. Eventually, the 1977 elections saw the end of Labor Party's unchallenged reign over Israeli politics with the election of Menachem <b>Begin</b> <b>and</b> the Likud Party.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ongoing}} {{disputes}} over the modern façade {{of the proposed}} new building, which some felt did not properly match the Jewish Quarter's aesthetic, an Englishman named Charles Clore took the initiative to fund a new design projects. He commissioned Denys Lasdun, who drew up plans between 1978 and 1981 that more closely adhered to the original Hurva. His plans were still considered insufficient, as they were rejected by Prime Minister Menachem <b>Begin</b> <b>and</b> the Minister of Interior, who refused to sign papers enabling construction to begin. No further progress was made and when Clore, who had wished to see the synagogue completed in his lifetime, died, his daughter provided funds to create {{one of the few}} open spaces in the Jewish Quarter adjacent to the Hurva.|$|E
50|$|Note: the {{deletion}} of the Om syllable in the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> {{addition of}} the Hrīh syllable is an adaptation. Hrīh signifies the element metal and lungs.

5|$|Kingston {{lost its}} most {{influential}} advocate as permanent {{site of the}} Hockey Hall of Fame when Sutherland died in 1955. By 1958, the Hockey Hall of Fame had still not raised sufficient funds to construct a permanent building in Kingston. Clarence Campbell, then President of the NHL, grew tired {{of waiting for the}} construction to <b>begin</b> <b>and</b> withdrew the NHL's support to situate the hall in Kingston. In the same year, the NHL and the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) reached an agreement to establish a new Hall of Fame building in Toronto, in the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame located at Exhibition Place. The temporary Hockey Hall of Fame opened as an exhibit within the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in August 1958, and 350,000 people visited it during the 1958 CNE fair. Due {{to the success of the}} exhibit, NHL and CNE decided that a permanent home in the Exhibition Place was needed. The NHL agreed to fully fund the building of the new facility on the grounds of Exhibition Place, and construction began in 1960. The first permanent Hockey Hall of Fame, which shared a building with the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, was opened on August 26, 1961, by Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. Over 750,000 people visited the Hall in its inaugural year. Admission to the Hockey Hall of Fame was free until 1980, when the Hockey Hall of Fame facilities underwent expansion.|$|E
5|$|On Wednesday, Assad sent Tlass to Moscow {{to seek a}} {{comprehensive}} air umbrella. The Soviets refused but prepared large amounts of military equipment at airfields for dispatch to Syria and sent Marshall Pavel Stepanovich Kutakhov to Syria {{to find out what}} happened to the Syrian SAMs, fearing that NATO might do the same in Eastern Europe. On June 9, Assad met with American envoy Habib in Damascus and rejected his terms, demanding that Israel withdraw its forces from Lebanon as a condition for a ceasefire. US President Ronald Reagan called on <b>Begin</b> <b>and</b> Assad to accept a ceasefire effective at 6:00 AM, on June 10. By noon on Friday, when the ceasefire took effect, the IAF had shot down 82 aircraft without losing any in air combat. A year after the battle, a US fact-finding mission headed by Lieutenant-General John Chain, then deputy chief of staff for plans and operations, arrived in Israel to learn lessons from the battle.|$|E
5|$|On March 1, 1861, Davis {{appointed}} General P. G. T. Beauregard {{to command}} all Confederate {{troops in the}} vicinity of Charleston, South Carolina, where state officials prepared to take possession of Fort Sumter. Beauregard was to prepare his forces but await orders to attack the fort. Within the fort the issue was not of the niceties of geo-political posturing but of survival. They would be out of food on the 15th. The small Union crew had but half a dozen officers under Major Robert Anderson. Famously, this included the baseball folk hero Abner Doubleday. More improbable yet was a Union officer who had the name of Jefferson C. Davis. He would spend the war being taunted for his name but not his loyalty to the Northern cause. The newly installed President Lincoln, not wishing to initiate hostilities, informed South Carolina Governor Pickens that he was dispatching a small fleet of ships from the navy yard in New York to resupply but not re-enforce Fort Pickens in Florida and Fort Sumter. The US President did not inform CSA President Davis of this intended resupply of food and fuel. Jefferson Davis, for Lincoln, was the leader of an insurrection and so without legal standing in US affairs. To deal with him would be to give legitimacy to the rebellion. Holding to the belief that Sumter was the property of the sovereign United States was the reason for maintaining the garrison on the island fortress. He informed Gov. Pickens that the resupply mission would not land troops or munitions unless they were fired upon. As it turned out, just as the supply ships approached Charleston harbor, the bombardment would <b>begin</b> <b>and</b> the flotilla watched the spectacle from 10 miles at sea.|$|E
