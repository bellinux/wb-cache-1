5|$|As the Allied victory {{began to}} look certain, Keynes was heavily involved, {{as leader of the}} British {{delegation}} and chairman of the World <b>Bank</b> <b>commission,</b> in the mid-1944 negotiations that established the Bretton Woods system. The Keynes-plan, concerning an international clearing-union, argued for a radical system for the management of currencies. He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the bancor, and new global institutions – a world central bank and the International Clearing Union. Keynes envisaged these institutions managing an international trade and payments system with strong incentives for countries to avoid substantial trade deficits or surpluses. The USA's greater negotiating strength, however, meant that the final outcomes accorded more closely to the more conservative plans of Harry Dexter White. According to US economist J. Bradford DeLong, on almost every point where he was overruled by the Americans, Keynes was later proved correct by events.|$|E

50|$|The Matador Cooperative Farm, later {{known as}} the Matador Farming Pool, was an {{agricultural}} cooperative started on 10,000 acres of land {{near the town of}} Kyle, Saskatchewan in Canada.

Membership in the cooperative gradually declined, and the farm was sold to the Saskatchewan Land <b>Bank</b> <b>Commission</b> in 1975. Ten members leased some of the land and assets back, including the Kyle Seed Cleaning Plant and the Swift Current plant, which cleaned lentils, chick peas, and peas. The group also continued to raise wheat and cattle. In 2011, the cooperative disbanded and its assets were sold.|$|E

50|$|North Deering is {{the northernmost}} {{neighborhood}} {{of the city}} of Portland, Maine.

Today it has become a suburban neighborhood with some retail activity. It is home to WGME, Portland's local CBS affiliate.

50|$|The fate of pawnbroking in Switzerland {{appears to}} be not very {{dissimilar}} {{from that of the}} Jew who is fabled to have once started in business at Aberdeen. Nevertheless, the cantons of Bern and Zürich enacted elaborate laws for the regulation of the business. In Zürich the broker must be licensed by the cantonal government, and the permit can be refused only when the applicant is known to be a person undeserving of confidence. Regular books have to be kept, which must be at all times open to the inspection of the police, and not more than 1% interest per month may be charged. A loan runs for six months, and unredeemed pledges may be sold by auction a month after the expiration of the fixed period, and then the sale must take place in the parish in which the article was pledged. No more than two persons at a time have ever been licensed under this law, the business being unprofitable owing to the low rate of interest. In the canton of Bern there were once two pawnbrokers. One died and the other put up his shutters. The Zürich cantonal bank, however, conducts a pawnbroking department, which lends nothing under 4s. or over £40 without the special sanction of the <b>bank</b> <b>commission.</b> Loans must not exceed two-thirds of the trade value of the pledge, but 80% may be lent upon the intrinsic value of gold and silver articles. The establishment makes practically no profit. The Swiss disinclination to go to the pawnshop is, perhaps, accounted for in some measure by the growing number of dealers in second-hand articles, to whom persons in want of ready money sell outright such things as are usually pledged, in the hope of subsequently buying them back. Since, however, the dealer is at liberty to ask his own price for repurchase, the expectation is often illusory, and can usually be fulfilled only upon ruinous terms.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{contribute}} to the extensive study of the World <b>Bank</b> <b>Commission</b> on Growth and Development by a case study of the Turkish automotive and the consumer electronics industries. Despite a macroeconomic environment that inhibits investment and growth, both industries have achieved remarkable output and productivity growth since the early 1990 s and {{played a critical role in}} generating employment and fostering growth. Although there are similarities between the performances of automobile and consumer electronic industries, there seems to be significant differences between their structures, links with domestic suppliers, technological orientation and modes of integration with the global economy. The automobile industry is dominated by multinational companies, has a strong domestic supplier base, and has seized the opportunities opened up by the Customs Union by investing in new product and process technology and learning. The consumer electronics industry is dominated by a few, large domestic firms, and has become competitive in the European market thanks to its geographical proximity, productive domestic labor, and focus on a protected and technologically mature CRT color television receivers segment of the marker, which also helps explain the recent decline in industry’s fortunes. It is without doubt that these industries could have performed even better had governments in Turkey adopted more responsive macroeconomic policies. It is certain that government...|$|E
