5|$|In 2015, the Supreme Court {{continued}} {{hearings on}} the PLI case about the statues.

5|$|Two {{counties}} were {{proposed in}} Florida's state legislature, but neither actually became counties.

5|$|Waring {{sent two}} {{threatening}} letters to Sharp, and on June 18, 1821, published a handbill attacking Sharp's character. Five days later, Sharp ceased campaigning for the senatorial seat.

50|$|In <b>the</b> Ontario <b>legislature</b> this {{confrontation}} provides much of {{the material}} for Oral Questions and Members' Statements.

5|$|After {{the loss}} of these two railway {{executive}} positions, Beauregard spent time briefly {{at a variety of}} companies and civil engineering pursuits, but his personal wealth became assured when he was recruited as a supervisor of the Louisiana Lottery in 1877. He and former Confederate general Jubal Early presided over lottery drawings and made numerous public appearances, lending the effort some respectability. For 15 years the two generals served in these positions, but the public became opposed to government-sponsored gambling and the lottery was closed down <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature.</b>|$|E
5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> to prevent an act or {{decision}} by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute {{to indicate that the}} decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E
5|$|Another $500,000 {{study was}} ordered in 2003 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> {{creating}} a new commerce corridor to link Lewis County {{in the south to}} the Canada–US border in the north. However the study showed that a highway existing north of I-90 was not economically feasible. The study proposed a toll road only for trucks, since the presence of passenger cars would discourage truck drivers from using the new alternate route. The highway was estimated to cost between $13.5 and $19 billion.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> state <b>legislatures</b> often {{instructed}} Members of Congress how to vote {{on specific}} issues. More exactly, they [...] "instructed" [...] the Senators (who were elected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislatures),</b> and [...] "requested" [...] the Representatives (who were elected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> people.) On rare occasions a Senator resigned rather than follow instructions.|$|R
5000|$|The Executive in the LADC is the organ, which executes <b>the</b> laws made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Legislatures.</b> <b>The</b> {{administrative}} {{head of the}} Executive is the Executive Secretary and the Executive Secretary has {{to assist}} the Chief Executive Member {{in dealing with the}} Executive works of the LADC. Besides these, departments which are under the executive Secretary, are also supervised, controlled and directed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Executive Secretary through the General Administration Department.|$|R
50|$|When a {{municipality}} {{was created}} in 1873 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ontario <b>Legislature</b> to govern <b>the</b> settlements around Thunder Bay, Pie Island {{was included in the}} Municipality of Shuniah.

5|$|Another issue {{concerned}} {{the election of}} the president. Few agreed with Madison that the executive should be elected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature.</b> There was widespread concern with direct election, because information diffused so slowly in the late 18th century, and because of concerns that people would only vote for candidates from their state or region. A vocal minority wanted the national executive to be chosen by the governors of the states.|$|E
5|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, {{judgments}} handed down by the courts are considered a source of law. Judgments may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and equity laid down, not <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes.|$|E
5|$|Buckner {{proposed}} {{a number of}} progressive ideas, {{most of which were}} rejected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature.</b> Among his successful proposals were the creation of a state board of tax equalization, creation of a parole system for convicts, and codification of school laws. His failed proposals included creation of a department of justice, greater local support for education and better protection for forests.|$|E

A {{small part of}} the Montgomery County territory was detached, as were parts of Fayette County in Washington Court House in Union Township and the townships of Jasper and Marion. Part of Brown County was added, Jackson and Eagle Townships. These were the boundaries for the rest of McEwen's service in Congress.|$|E
5|$|On February 23, 1871, the West Virginia Legislature {{passed an}} act {{incorporating}} the South Branch Railway Company, {{responsible for the}} construction and operation of a branch line connecting Romney with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad main line at Green Spring.

5|$|Roberts {{began to}} {{re-enter}} politics {{after the death}} of her father in 1992, first focusing on hospice and health care issues. As a member (since 1999) and later {{chairman of the board of}} Mercy Regional Medical Center, she pushed for the construction of a new hospital in Durango. She chaired Healthy 58, a rural health care task force, and in 2001, was appointed to the Task Force to Evaluate Health Care Needs for Colorado, a commission formed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> to study health-care needs in rural Colorado communities.|$|E

50|$|The new bridge, {{opened on}} December 30, 2006, {{is called the}} Penobscot Narrows Bridge and Observatory. <b>The</b> <b>legislature's</b> Transportation Committee {{originally}} {{decided it would be}} named the Downeast Gateway Bridge, but strong opposition by community leaders from eastern Waldo County forced this decision to be reconsidered.

5|$|Seven {{states had}} already seceded when Breckinridge took his seat as a senator, leaving the {{remaining}} Southern senators more outnumbered in their defense of slavery. Seeking {{to find a}} compromise that would reunite the states under constitutional principles, he urged Lincoln to withdraw federal forces from the Confederate states in order to avert war. The congressional session ended on March 28, and in an April 2 address to the Kentucky General Assembly, he continued to advocate peaceful reconciliation of the states and proposed a conference of border states to seek a solution. On April 12, Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter, ending plans for the conference. Breckinridge recommended that Governor Beriah Magoffin call a sovereignty convention to determine whether Kentucky would side with the Union or the Confederacy. On May 10, he was chosen <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> as one of six delegates to a conference to decide the state's next action. The states' rights delegates were Breckinridge, Magoffin, and Richard Hawes; the Unionist delegates were Crittenden, Archibald Dixon, and S.S. Nicholas. Unable to agree on substantial issues, the delegates recommended that Kentucky adopt a neutral stance in the Civil War and arm itself to prevent invasion by either federal or Confederate forces. Breckinridge did not support this recommendation, but he agreed to abide by it once it was approved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature.</b>|$|E
5|$|Six {{years later}} Beckham again {{attempted}} {{to win the}} Senate seat. Due {{to the passage of}} the Seventeenth Amendment, the senator would not be elected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> but by popular vote. In the Democratic primary Beckham defeated Augustus O. Stanley, a 12-year veteran congressman. The Republican nominee was former governor Augustus E. Willson. Bolstered by his support of President Woodrow Wilson, Beckham won the election by 32,000 votes.|$|E
