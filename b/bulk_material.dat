5|$|Californium-252 has {{a number}} of {{specialized}} applications as a strong neutron emitter, and each microgram of fresh californium produces 139 million neutrons per minute. This property makes californium useful as a neutron startup source for some nuclear reactors and as a portable (non-reactor based) neutron source for neutron activation analysis to detect trace amounts of elements in samples. Neutrons from californium are employed as a treatment of certain cervical and brain cancers where other radiation therapy is ineffective. It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when the Georgia Institute of Technology received a loan of 119µg of californium-252 from the Savannah River Plant. It is also used with online elemental coal analyzers and <b>bulk</b> <b>material</b> analyzers in the coal and cement industries.|$|E

25|$|The {{ablation}} of {{the target}} material upon laser irradiation {{and the creation of}} plasma are very complex processes. The removal of atoms from the <b>bulk</b> <b>material</b> is done by vaporization of the bulk at the surface region in a state of non-equilibrium. In this the incident laser pulse penetrates into the surface of the material within the penetration depth. This dimension is dependent on the laser wavelength and the index of refraction {{of the target}} material at the applied laser wavelength and is typically in the region of 10nm for most materials. The strong electrical field generated by the laser light is sufficiently strong to remove the electrons from the <b>bulk</b> <b>material</b> of the penetrated volume. This process occurs within 10 ps of a ns laser pulse and is caused by non-linear processes such as multiphoton ionization which are enhanced by microscopic cracks at the surface, voids, and nodules, which increase the electric field. The free electrons oscillate within the electromagnetic field of the laser light and can collide with the atoms of the <b>bulk</b> <b>material</b> thus transferring some of their energy to the lattice of the target material within the surface region. The surface of the target is then heated up and the material is vaporized.|$|E
40|$|Zeolite-geopolymer hybrid {{materials}} {{have been formed}} when kaolin {{was used as a}} starting material. Their characteristics are of interest because they can have a wide pore size distribution with micro- and meso-pores due to the zeolite and geopolymer, respectively. In this study, Zeolite-geopolymer hybrid <b>bulk</b> <b>materials</b> were fabricated using four kinds of kaolinitic clays (a halloysite and three kinds of kaolinite). The kaolinitic clays were first calcined at 700 °C for 3 h to transform into the amorphous aluminosilicate phases. Alkali-activation treatment of the metakaolin yielded <b>bulk</b> <b>materials</b> with different amounts and types of zeolite and different compressive strength. This study investigated the effects of the initial kaolinitic clays on the amount and types of zeolite in the resultant geopolymers as well as the strength of the <b>bulk</b> <b>materials.</b> The kaolinitic clays and their metakaolin were characterized by XRD analysis, chemical composition, crystallite size, 29 Si and 27 Al MAS NMR analysis, and specific surface area measurements. The correlation between the amount of zeolite formed and the compressive strength of the resultant hybrid <b>bulk</b> <b>materials,</b> previously reported by other researchers was not positively observed. In the studied systems, the effects of Si/Al and crystalline size were observed. When the atomic ratio of Si/Al in the starting kaolinitic clays increased, the compressive strength of the hybrid <b>bulk</b> <b>materials</b> increased. The crystallite size of the zeolite in the hybrid <b>bulk</b> <b>materials</b> increased with decreasing compressive strength of the hybrid <b>bulk</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

To investigate the effects of <b>bulking</b> <b>material</b> on vermicompost quality, an experiment was conducted in a factorial design with three replications. In this experiment, the final dried sludge in lagoons was mixed with <b>bulking</b> <b>materials</b> (woodchips, three leaves, and wheat straw) in four mixing proportion with swage sludge (0, 15, 30 and 45 %, V/V). Chemical properties of <b>bulking</b> <b>materials,</b> sewage sludge, and produced vermicomposts were determined. Vermicomposts had relatively low pH and electrical conductivity (EC). The nutrients content of vermicompost, especially N, P, Fe, and Zn, were high. These properties showed its suitable quality for use in agriculture. Heavy metals concentrations of vermicomposts, except Zn, were lower than recommended values by EPA. Mixing of <b>Bulking</b> <b>materials</b> with sewage sludge decreased pH, N, Pb, Co, and Cd, but increased Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, and Ni content of produced vermicomposts. In most cases, the concentrations of nutrients were higher in 30 % mixing proportion.

25|$|There {{are several}} ways in which {{crystalline}} and amorphous materials can be engineered to increase their yield strength. By altering dislocation density, impurity levels, grain size (in crystalline materials), the yield strength of the material can be fine tuned. This occurs typically by introducing defects such as impurities dislocations in the material. To move this defect (plastically deforming or yielding the material), a larger stress must be applied. This thus causes a higher yield stress in the material. While many material properties depend only on {{the composition of the}} <b>bulk</b> <b>material,</b> yield strength is extremely sensitive to the materials processing as well.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{to surface}} tension, {{adsorption}} {{is a consequence}} of surface energy. In a <b>bulk</b> <b>material,</b> all the bonding requirements (be they ionic, covalent or metallic) of the constituent atoms of the material are filled by other atoms in the material. However, atoms {{on the surface of the}} adsorbent are not wholly surrounded by other adsorbent atoms and therefore can attract adsorbates. The exact nature of the bonding depends on the details of the species involved, but the adsorption process is generally classified as physisorption (characteristic of weak van der Waals forces) or chemisorption (characteristic of covalent bonding). It may also occur due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E

It is an exothermic reaction which can release large amounts of energy both as electromagnetic radiation and as kinetic energy of the fragments (heating the <b>bulk</b> <b>material</b> where fission takes place). In order for fission to produce energy, the total binding energy of the resulting elements must be less negative (higher energy) {{than that of the}} starting element.|$|E
25|$|Where τr0 is the {{intrinsic}} carrier radiative lifetime of the <b>bulk</b> <b>material,</b> a is the differential gain, vg {{is the group}} velocity, τp = Q/ωL is the photon lifetime, ωL is the lasing frequency, β is the spontaneous emission coupling factor which is enhanced by the Purcell effect, and 1 /τtotal = F/τr0 +1/τnr where τnr is the non-radiative lifetime. In the case of minimal Purcell effect in a classical cavity with small F = Q/Vmode, only the first term of equation 1 is considered, {{and the only way}} to increase modulation frequency is to increase photon density P0 by increasing the pumping power. However, thermal effects practically limit the modulation frequency to around 20GHz, making this approach is inefficient.|$|E

A normal ellipsometer does not measure the actual reflection coefficient (which requires careful photometric calibration of the illuminating beam) but the ratio of the p and s reflections, as well as change of polarization ellipticity (hence the name) induced upon reflection by the surface being studied. In addition to use in science and research, ellipsometers are used in situ to control production processes for instance.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} many types of PV systems known to be effective, {{crystalline}} silicon PV accounted for around 90% of the worldwide production of PV in 2013. Manufacturing silicon PV systems has several steps. First, polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of Boron, a group III element, are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes. Typically using a seed crystal, an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the <b>bulk</b> <b>material</b> with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a group V element, which creates an N-type semiconducting surface. To reduce energy losses an anti-reflective coating {{is added to the}} surface, along with electrical contacts. After finishing the cell, cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation.|$|E
