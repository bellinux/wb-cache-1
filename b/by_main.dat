5|$|A {{realignment}} of {{the highway}} between Newman and Port Hedland had been proposed since 1976, which would see the road deviate to the west at Newman, and travel via Wittenoom instead of Marble Bar. In the early 1980s, eleven route corridors were investigated <b>by</b> <b>Main</b> Roads. The potential impacts on the natural environment, regional economy, tourism, and resident population were considered, with particular concern for the crossing of the Hamersley Range.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to analyze}} illocutionary act {{performed}} <b>by</b> the <b>main</b> {{characters in a}} movie entitled The Back-up Plan. The objectives {{of this study are}} (1) to identify the types of illocutionary act and (2) to reveal the functions of illocutionary act performed <b>by</b> the <b>main</b> characters in the movie. The study applied the descriptive qualitative method with the researcher as the main instrument and the data sheets as the secondary instrument. The discussion was presented in a descriptive way. The data were utterances in the form of words, phrases, and sentences spoken <b>by</b> the <b>main</b> characters in the movie. After being collected, the data were organized and analyzed based on Searle and Leech’s theory of illocutionary act. To gain the trustworthiness of the data in this study, triangulation was applied. This study reveals some findings. First, there are four types of illocutionary act performed <b>by</b> the <b>main</b> characters in the movie. They are representative act, directive act, expressive act, and commissive act. Representative act is found as the most dominant type performed <b>by</b> the <b>main</b> characters. The main characters employ representative act to convey their ideas to each other. On the other hand, declarative act is not performed <b>by</b> the <b>main</b> characters in the movie since performing felicitous declarative act needs particular authorities and circumstances. Second, there are three functions of illocutionary act performed <b>by</b> the <b>main</b> characters in this movie. They are collaborative function, competitive function, and convivial function. The most dominant function performed <b>by</b> the <b>main</b> characters is collaborative function since it is intended to tell the truth of the main characters’ feelings to each other. Meanwhile, conflictive function is not performed <b>by</b> the <b>main</b> characters since it is intended to offend the hearer...|$|R

5|$|However, the Japanese retreated beyond Port Arthur's gunfire support range, and {{had been}} {{reinforced}} <b>by</b> <b>main</b> forces of six battleships. At 0850, Makarov turned around {{to head back to}} the harbor and join with three other battleships that had just left. After the squadron had united and turned back towards the enemy, about two miles from the shore, on 9.42 Petropavlosk detonated a Japanese-laid mine on her port side. Petropavlovsk sank, taking 27 officers and 652 men, including Admiral Makarov and war artist Vasily Vereshchagin with her. A monument was constructed in Saint Petersburg in 1913 to honor Stephan Makarov after Japanese divers identified his remains inside the wreck of Petropavlovsk and gave him a burial at sea.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a {{corridor}} study conducted <b>by</b> <b>Main</b> Roads into the long-term {{needs of the}} Perth to Darwin National Highway concluded the existing Great Northern Highway, with bypasses around rural towns and the Swan Valley, was the most suitable route for the National Highway. Planning the alignment for the southernmost section, from Reid Highway in Perth to Bindoon, was undertaken from 2003 to 2013. It resulted in the planned alignment commencing from Tonkin Highway, bypassing the Swan Valley and Bullsbrook before reconnecting with Great Northern Highway near Brand Highway. Great Northern Highway is then followed until the Brockman River, where the planned route deviates to the east to bypass Bindoon, reconnecting with the existing Highway near Bindoon–Moora Road.|$|E
5|$|The town {{contains}} 13 residential neighbourhoods radiating {{out from}} {{the core of the}} old market town, and separated <b>by</b> <b>main</b> roads and railway lines. The nearby communities of Ifield, Pound Hill and Three Bridges were absorbed into the new town at various stages in its development. In 2009, expansion was being planned in the west and north-west of the town, in cooperation with Horsham District Council. Economically, the town has developed into the main centre of industry and employment between London and the south coast. Its large industrial area supports manufacturing and service companies, many of them connected with the airport. The commercial and retail sectors continue to expand.|$|E

5|$|Within {{two decades}} {{the bridge was}} {{considered}} a safety hazard, due to increased traffic volume, speed, and truck sizes. The primary concerns were deficiency in the width and curve radius. The bridge was strengthened as well as widened in 1959–60. Removing the footpath and using that space for the road had been suggested, but instead the structure itself was widened by , leaving the footpath intact. The approaches to the bridges were widened, new piers were erected {{either side of the}} railway span, and eight new girders were installed – six of which were part of the previous Causeway structure. The work was undertaken from a suspended platform, which had to be quickly pulled up when trains went past. The widening, designed <b>by</b> <b>Main</b> Road's second bridge engineer Gilbert Marsh, cost approximately ₤20,000.|$|E
5|$|Dedicated bus lanes {{have existed}} on the Kwinana Freeway {{since the late}} 1980s, when a project {{was set up to}} {{decrease}} bus commuters' travel times into Perth from suburbs south of the Swan River. In 1987, Main Roads Western Australia and Transperth trialled a contraflow bus lane along the Kwinana Freeway, from the Canning Interchange to the Narrows Interchange. The lane operated between 7:00 am and 9:30 am, the period with the most traffic congestion on the freeway. After two months, the results were examined, and the agencies decided to build an additional bus lane on the northbound carriageway. The construction included bus-only ramps {{at the beginning and end}} of the lane. The works were mainly funded by Transperth, which contributed $8.22 million out of the $10.23 million total cost. The remaining $2.01 million was provided <b>by</b> <b>Main</b> Roads Western Australia. The bus lane opened on 20 November 1989, and received an Institute of Engineers award for engineering excellence.|$|E
5|$|Today, many {{wildebeest}} {{populations are}} experiencing rapid declines. Overland migration as a biological process requires large connected landscapes, which are {{increasingly difficult to}} maintain, particularly over the long term, when human demands on the landscape compete. The most acute threat comes from migration barriers, such as fences and roads. In {{one of the more}} striking examples of the consequences of fence-building on terrestrial migrations, Botswanan authorities placed thousands of kilometres of fences across the Kalahari that prevented wildebeests from reaching watering holes and grazing grounds, resulting in the deaths {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals, reducing the wildebeest population to less than 10% of its previous size. Illegal hunting is a major conservation concern in many areas, along with natural threats posed <b>by</b> <b>main</b> predators (such as lions, leopards, hunting dogs and hyenas). Where the black and blue wildebeest share a common range, the two can hybridise, and this is regarded as a potential threat to the black wildebeest.|$|E
