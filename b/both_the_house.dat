5|$|According to Tchernov's 1962 paper, Passer predomesticus {{was found}} in the middle Acheulean (middle Pleistocene, {{probably}} more than 400,000 years old) layer E1 of the Oumm-Qatafa cave in Wadi Khareitoun near Bethlehem. In 1984, however, Tchernov wrote that P.predomesticus was about 140,000 years old, from the Yabrudian. Layer E1 contained remains of about 40bird species, including a premaxilla Tchernov described as a precursor of the Dead Sea sparrow (Passer moabiticus) and a tarsometatarsus and humerus tentatively allied with the house sparrow. An undetermined Acheulean layer of the same cave also contained fossils Tchernov described as precursors of <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and Spanish sparrows.|$|E
5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Fox-North Coalition, Mansfield agreed to act as Speaker of the House of Lords, taking up his post in February 1783. The main item of debate during the Coalition Ministry was the East India Bill, which provoked bitter arguments in <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords and House of Commons. In an attempt to speed up the process of passing the bill, Mansfield left his position as Speaker to debate directly on 15 December; when this failed to help he returned to the Woolsack the next day. The failure of the bill caused the government to be immediately dismissed, and Mansfield left his position on 23 December 1783.|$|E

Despite the 1831 Federal Pact, all provinces had long been discontent with the de facto primacy that Buenos Aires province held over them. On 28 February 1839, the province of Corrientes revolted and attacked both Buenos Aires and Entre Ríos provinces. Rosas counterattacked and defeated the rebels, killing their leader, the governor of Corrientes. In June, Rosas uncovered a plot by dissident Rosistas to oust him from power in {{what became known as}} the Maza conspiracy. Rosas imprisoned some of the plotters and executed others. Manuel Vicente Maza, president of <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives and the Supreme Court, was murdered by Rosas's Mazorca agents within the halls of the parliament on the pretext that his son was involved in the conspiracy.

The rebels attempted to ally with France, but were easily crushed, many losing their lives and properties in the process.|$|E

The Van Cortlandt family owned the property until they decided to sell <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and land to the City of New York in 1886.

5|$|Holmes {{spent the}} next five years {{gathering}} supporters for his grassroots movement, traveling at his own expense to gather petition signatures from across the state.

He {{spent the next}} four weeks championing the bill he wrote and cementing support in <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives and the Senate. Though many legislators supported the basic concept of a state-funded agricultural college, there was strong opposition from University of Michigan president Henry Tappan, who wanted the agriculture program to be part of his school. Nevertheless, Holmes prevailed. On February 12, 1855, Michigan Governor Kinsley S. Bingham signed Act 130, establishing the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, the school that would become Michigan State University. The final draft of the bill held only two significant differences from the one that Holmes presented: that the purchase price not exceed US $15 per acre, rather than the $25 Holmes desired; and that the site must be within ten miles (16km) of Lansing, a provision added to silence the various factions that wanted the new college built in their own backyards.|$|E
