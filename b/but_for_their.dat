5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the mirror in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E

25|$|As chariot warfare became {{eclipsed by}} mounted cavalry and {{infantry}} units with effective crossbowmen in the Warring States period (403–221 BC), {{the participation of}} the shi in battle dwindled as rulers sought men with actual military training, not just aristocratic background. This was also a period where philosophical schools flourished in China, while intellectual pursuits became highly valued amongst statesmen. Thus, the shi eventually became renowned not for their warrior's skills, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> scholarship, abilities in administration, and sound ethics and morality supported by competing philosophical schools.|$|E
25|$|The States of Holland did not await this Assembly, however, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own {{province}} {{immediately started}} to make constitutional alterations. On December 8, 1650, the States formally took over their Stadtholders' powers. The eighteen voting towns in the States were given the option {{to apply for a}} charter that enabled them to henceforth elect their own vroedschap members and magistrates, under ultimate supervision of the States, but otherwise without the usual drawing up of double lists, for outsiders to choose from. This did not apply to the non-voting towns, however, that still had to present double lists, but now to the States, instead of the Stadtholder. The States also assumed the power to appoint magistrates in the unincorporated countryside, like drosten and baljuws.|$|E

Recruits are screened not only for their ability to perform the tasks assigned, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> attitude in performing them —such as how they take hardships and unexpected difficulties, how well they work in groups and how they approach problem solving and disaster management situations. As many as 50% percent of those who commence the gibush will be dropped from further consideration at its conclusion.|$|E

Many of their characters {{have appeared in}} film, books, toys, and other media. Their shows had a worldwide audience of over 300million people in the 1960s and have been translated into more than 20languages. The works of Barbera and Hanna have been praised not only for their animation, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> music. The Cat Concerto (1946) and Johann Mouse (1952) have both been called [...] "masterpieces of animation" [...] largely because of their classical music.|$|E

[...] He was engaged to Jenny Wilson in 1716. That year he returned to England to formalize the lease to the plantation before he married. Before his return, Jenny Wilson had found another husband, James Roscoe. Lee learned this from William Byrd.|$|E

Bruce was held for four hours before being released on $5,000 bail. The January 1998 issue of Spin magazine ran a four-page cartoon lampooning Insane Clown Posse and Juggalos, claiming that the group was offensive [...] "not for their obscenity, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> stupidity". Spin likened Insane Clown Posse's stage act to [...] "a sort of circus karaoke" [...] and portrayed the group's fans as overweight suburbanites. On the group's website, Bruce responded to the article by stating, [...] "I could give a fuck less".|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Süß {{is based on}} the stereotype of the grasping Jewish moneylender. There is an early scene in which Süß is shown to possess a fortune in jewels and jewelry. In another, he tells an innocent German girl that his home is [...] "the world" [...] (reflecting the Nazi stereotype of Jews as rootless wanderers in contrast to the Germans' love of their German homeland). Several conversations between Jewish characters perpetuate the Nazi line that Jews are inherently hostile to non-Jews. According to David Welch, the Nazis issued a guide to the press explaining how to interpret the film. The guide emphasized that a key point of the film was that once Jews like Süß got into positions of responsibility and power, [...] "they exploited power, not {{for the good of the}} community, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own racial ends." ...|$|E
500|$|The Joe puppet was {{the first}} child {{marionette}} to be made {{as part of the}} new generation of Supermarionation puppets introduced for Captain Scarlet, for which the sculpting team were careful to achieve realistic proportions for the body of a nine-year-old boy. The puppets of Sam Loover and Shane Weston had each made several appearances in the previous series, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> regular role in the new series a variety of alternative heads were created from the [...] "expressionless" [...] templates – including [...] "smilers", [...] "frowners" [...] and [...] "blinkers" [...] – and the Shane Weston puppet was re-wigged. Many of the recycled [...] "revamp puppets", used to depict supporting characters for Captain Scarlet, were also duplicated with darker skin colours to portray characters from a range of ethnicities. Further to these requirements, the use of two shooting soundstages necessitated the duplication of all the [...] "expressionless" [...] main character puppets to avoid conflicts over resources between the two filming units. As in the previous series, [...] "under control" [...] puppets, manipulated by levers from below as opposed to wires from a gantry above, feature in Joe 90.|$|E
500|$|The Abbasid army, {{following}} the reforms of al-Mu'tasim, was a {{smaller and more}} professional fighting force than the caliphal armies of the past. Although it proved effective militarily, it also posed a potential danger to {{the stability of the}} Abbasid regime: drawn from Turks and other peoples from the Caliphate's periphery and the lands beyond, it was alienated from the society of the Caliphate's heartlands, with the result that the soldiers were [...] "entirely reliant on the state not just for cash <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> very survival" [...] (Hugh Kennedy). As a result, any failure by the central government to provide their pay resulted in a military uprising and a political crisis, as had been repeatedly demonstrated during the Anarchy at Samarra. Consequently, ensuring the regular payment of the army became the prime task of the state. According to Hugh Kennedy, based on a treasury document from the time of al-Mu'tadid's accession, [...] "out of the total expenditure of 7915 dinars per day, some 5121 are entirely military, 1943 in areas (like riding animals and stables) which served both military and non-military and only 851 in areas like the bureaucracy and the harem which can be described as truly civilian (though even in this case, the bureaucrats’ main purpose seems to have been to arrange the payment of the army). It seems reasonable to conclude that something over 80 per cent of recorded government expenditure was devoted to maintaining the army." ...|$|E

500|$|Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters {{described}} The Red Sea Sharks as a [...] "complex, ambiguous, even labyrinthine" [...] story {{which was}} [...] "undoubtedly {{the book in}} which Hergé ventured furthest into the creation of his own universe." [...] He thought that [...] "Hergé enters a new phase" [...] with The Red Sea Sharks, as its author [...] "seems to know his family of characters better and better, and he enjoys playing with them and his readers." [...] Peeters noted that the book was [...] "in some respects a continuation" [...] of Land of Black Gold, an assessment shared by Thompson, the Lofficiers, and Farr, all of whom {{described it as a}} partial sequel to the earlier book. Thompson added that The Red Sea Sharks [...] "atoned for the relative failure" [...] of Land of Black Gold, believing that although it had a [...] "rather hasty finish", it was [...] "a first-rate thriller". The Lofficiers awarded it four out of five, stating that it was [...] "very effective as a modern political thriller and far more believable than The Calculus Affair". They also opined that it provided an effective political commentary on the West's relationship with the Arab world. In their analysis, Tintin and Haddock seek to aid the Emir not because he is a good leader, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own selfish purposes (to get Abdullah out of Marlinspike), just as Western governments and corporations build alliances with Arab leaders guilty of human rights abuses in order to benefit their own interests.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} Heian period (ninth century), the {{tradition}} changed {{and the two}} statues started to be different and be called differently.

Gradually the animals returned to be identical, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> mouths, and ended up being called both komainu.|$|E
2500|$|Inspired by her parents' novel {{standard}} of dressing for health purposes, Walker was infamous for contesting traditional female wardrobe. In 1871, she wrote, [...] "The greatest sorrows from which women suffer to-day are those physical, moral, and mental ones, that {{are caused by}} their unhygienic manner of dressing!" [...] She strongly opposed women's long skirts with numerous petticoats, not only for their discomfort and their inhibition to the wearer's mobility, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> collection and spread of dust and dirt. [...] As a young woman, she began experimenting with various skirt-lengths and layers, all with men's trousers underneath. By 1861, her typical ensemble included trousers with suspenders under a knee-length dress with a tight waist and full skirt.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} the {{regiment}} was ready for service, {{the war in the}} Middle East was almost over. The regiment fought in only one major battle at Megiddo in September 1918. Over ten days the 5th Light Horse Brigade advanced [...] destroying road and rail links, and pursuing the retreating Ottoman Army into Syria. They [...] entered Damascus on 1 October 1918. [...] When the war ended the regiment was recalled to Egypt to assist in policing a riot that had broken out, before returning to Australia. The war cost the regiment sixteen killed and only three wounded, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> service they were awarded fourteen battle honours, most of them inherited from the disbanded Imperial Camel Corps.|$|E
