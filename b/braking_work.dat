In {{the first part of}} this thesis systems were categorized by their function and characteristic. After that there were created a survey about accident rate and there were shown the most common causes in road accidents. In the second part was discussed principle how brake assist systems and automatic emergency <b>braking</b> <b>work.</b> In the last section was explained assessment under Euro NCAP directives, where the attention was focused onassesment of the experimentsof safety assist...|$|E
40|$|Diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{deceleration}} of the motorcycles {{with the use of}} engine <b>braking.</b> <b>Work</b> can by divided into theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part begins with the possibility of division motorcycles according to several criteria. Below is given the primary papers of literature, usable in connection with the issue of this work. Subsequently, the work discusses the factors which are affecting the course of the deceleration with the use of engine braking. The practical part acquaints the reader with available measuring devices, with the place of measurement and the methodology. The following are listed specific measured values for individual motorcycles, supplemented with graphical output. At the end of the practical part is for comparison a brief summary of the measured values of each tested vehicle. Interpretation and evaluation of the measured data are contained in the conclusion of the work...|$|E
40|$|User {{innovation}} {{school by}} Eric von Hippel and his numerous co investigators has done ground <b>braking</b> <b>work</b> in exploring {{how and why}} users innovate, in identifying lead-users and contributions from user innovation communities. The present paper focuses on four understudied issues in this framework that come visible when one re-examines the analysis of rodeo-kayaking by Baldwin, Hienerth and von Hippel (2006) and Hienert (2006) originally geared towards exploring the role of user-innovators in industry development also after the earliest stages. These themes are 1) the scope of user innovation; 2) the evolution of design space for a user practice; 3) the range of ways users are involved in innovation; and 4) the range of users that are innovative in design relevant ways. The findings related to these issues add some qualifiers and suggest re-phrasings {{to some of the}} questions user-innovation school asks about user-innovation and industry development...|$|E

40|$|Adequate {{models of}} {{reasoning}} with vague information {{are not only}} of perennial interest to philosophers and logicians (see, e. g., [6, 5, 12, 2, 11] and references there), {{but also in the}} focus of linguistic research (see, e. g., [10, 7, 1, 8]). Of particular interest from a logical point of view are approaches to formal semantics a natural language that {{can be traced back to}} Richard Montague’s ground <b>braking</b> <b>work,</b> firmly connecting modern formal logic and linguistics (see, e. g., the handbook chapter [9] and the widely used textbook [4]). At a first glimpse, it seems that all important contemporary linguistic models of vagueness are incompatible with the degree based approach offered by fuzzy logic (see, e. g., [13, 14, 3]). E. g., Manfred Pinkal in his frequently cited (and translated) monograph [10] explicitly argues that many-valued, truth functional logics are inadequate for modelling central linguistic phenomena of vagueness and indeterminateness. More specifically, contemporary linguists seem to agree that a special type of context dependency is the key to understand the semantics o...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid test dummies {{provide a}} safe {{alternative}} to human subjects when investigating mechanisms of wheelchair tips and falls. The data that researchers acquire from these test dummies are more useful if the test dummy represents the population being studied. The goal {{of this study was}} to measure the validity of a 50 th percentile Hybrid II test dummy (HTD) as an accurate representation of a wheelchair user. A test pilot with T 8 paraplegia due to traumatic spinal cord injury served as a basis for validation. Simple modifications were made to the HTD to approximate the trunk stability characteristics of a person with a spinal cord injury. An HTD, a modified HTD, and a human test pilot were seated in an electric-powered wheelchair and several braking tests performed. The standard HTD underestimated the kinematics when compared to the test pilot. The modified HTD had less trunk stability than the standard HTD during all braking methods. The modified HTD and wheelchair test pilot had similar trunk stability characteristics during kill switch and joystick full-reverse braking conditions. The modified HTD is a satisfactory representation of a wheelchair user with a spinal cord injury; however, the modified test dummy underestimates the trunk dynamics during the less extreme joystick release <b>braking.</b> <b>Work</b> should continue on the development of a low-speed, low-impact test dummy that emulates the wheelchair user population. © 2001 IPEM...|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} brake was a Westinghouse compressed-air <b>brake.</b> <b>Braking</b> <b>worked</b> on {{one side}} of all the carrying and coupled wheels. Some of the locomotives were later equipped with Indusi train protection.|$|R
50|$|The compressed-air <b>brakes</b> <b>worked</b> on {{only the}} first three cars of the train, and seven brakemen (two of whom died in the derailment) had been {{distributed}} throughout the train, to set the brakes when signalled {{to do so by}} the locomotive whistle.|$|R

50|$|The {{suspension}} was conventional for {{the time}} with half elliptic leaf springs all round mounted above the axles. The pedal <b>brakes</b> <b>work</b> shoes in enclosed drums on all four wheels by rods but the handbrake uses those on the back wheels and operates them by chain.

50|$|An exhaust <b>brake</b> <b>works</b> by {{causing a}} {{restriction}} in the exhaust, {{much like the}} intake throttle causes in a gasoline engine. In simple terms, it works by increasing the back-pressure of the exhaust. Nearly all of these brakes are butterfly valves similar to a throttle valve, mounted downstream of the turbocharger if there is one.|$|R
50|$|The engine's air brakes, {{fitted in}} 1979, were {{modified}} {{so that the}} engine's <b>brakes</b> <b>work</b> {{in conjunction with the}} air brakes when hauling a train. Every valve and component was dismantled and overhauled, with the intention of making the locomotive as reliable as possible for the future. The engine was returned to traffic in July 2005, before aesthetic completion.|$|R
50|$|The Motoring Correspondent of The Times {{wrote that}} when on trial {{there was no}} sign of overheating. Seven {{bearings}} for the crankshaft might improve the engine's smoothness but, without sudden opening of the throttle, it is smooth and silky. Clutch worked well, change-speed was light and easy. <b>Brakes</b> <b>worked</b> well and all seats were comfortable for passengers as well as driver.|$|R
50|$|When {{trying to}} get a car on the road the crew always insist on getting the {{important}} things done first, like making an entire fuel system for a vehicle that already has one before making the <b>brakes</b> <b>work,</b> putting a blower on an engine instead of fixing cooling problems, or putting new wheels and tyres on before checking if the car even runs.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{essentially}} three development phases for the Lloyd 400, {{and the first}} batch of cars was delivered with drum brakes of 180mm diameter, controlled via a cable linkage. From March 1953, however, a hydraulic linkage mechanism was installed, and on cars produced after August 1955 {{the diameter of the}} brake drums was increased to 200mm. [...] The mechanically controlled hand <b>brake</b> <b>worked</b> on the front wheels.|$|R
50|$|Every Bicycle rodeo has {{a safety}} course. Most rodeos begin the {{course with the}} safety check for both the rider and the bicycle because it is very important. The safety check for the rider is the helmet and bicycle fit. An ABC quick check is {{performed}} on the bicycle. The ABC quick check consists of checking for proper air in the tires, checking {{to see that the}} <b>brakes</b> <b>work,</b> and checking that the chains are on properly.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} Typ P {{was made}} from 1928 to 1929 and was available as a convertible or a roadster. The engine produced [...] and the car {{was referred to as}} the DKW P15 as a result. Power was transmitted via a three speed manual gear box to the rear wheels. Even at this stage the mechanically operated foot <b>brake</b> <b>worked</b> on all four wheels: the handbrake operated on the front leftside wheel and on the rear rightside wheel.|$|R
5000|$|The vehicle had a four-cylinder two-block {{in-line engine}} with 2,084 cc of {{displacement}} with which developed {{a maximum of}} [...] at 1900 rpm. Power was transmitted to the rear wheels through a four-speed countershaft gearbox and a steel propeller shaft. A top speed of 65 km/h (40 mph) was claimed. The mechanical foot <b>brake</b> <b>worked</b> directly on the propeller shaft. [...] The car had a ladder frame and two leaf-sprung solid axles. It was available as a sports two-seater.|$|R
50|$|The {{main gearbox}} {{contains}} five speed forward of which all are synchronised and one reverse gear. In addition, {{the vehicle is}} equipped with a two-step reduction gear. Both axles are driven and equipped with planetary hub reduction and differential locks. The front axle drive engagement works pneumatically and can be used during driving. Suspension is carried out with leaf springs, the front axle has got also shock absorbers. The service brakes are air operated and the hand <b>brake</b> <b>works</b> by releasing of the air pressure.|$|R
50|$|The counter-pressure brake (German: Gegendruckbremse), {{also named}} the Riggenbach counter-pressure brake after its inventor, Niklaus Riggenbach, {{is a dynamic}} railway brake on steam {{locomotives}} that brakes the locomotive using the driving cylinders. In doing so it reduces wear and tear and overheating of the driving wheel tyres and brake blocks and enables a continuously high brake force to be applied. The <b>brake</b> <b>works</b> by using the cylinders as air compressors and converting kinetic energy into heat. Steam is emitted during braking {{but this does not}} come from the boiler, it is produced by evaporation of water used to cool the cylinders.|$|R

50|$|Westinghouse compressed-air brakes were {{installed}} for locomotive <b>braking.</b> This <b>worked</b> {{on one side}} only of all carrying and coupled wheels. Locomotives 19 012, 015, 017 and 022 were later fitted with Riggenbach counter-pressure brakes.|$|R
5000|$|... "The gears {{were easily}} changed, the <b>brakes</b> <b>worked</b> well, yet were smooth in application, and the {{steering}} is steady and light. Ample lock enables {{the car to}} turn in a small space. Of the springing I have no complaint; much of its efficiency is probably due to proper lubrication of the leaves. The various controls are to hand, {{and in addition to}} a horn button on the instrument board there is a large circular switch on the steering wheel so that warning can be given without having to take off a hand."

50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of drum brakes is their relative complexity. A person {{must have a}} general understanding of how drum <b>brakes</b> <b>work</b> and take simple steps to ensure the brakes are reassembled correctly when doing <b>work</b> on drum <b>brakes.</b> And, {{as a result of}} this increased complexity (compared to disc brakes), maintenance of drum brakes is generally more time-consuming. Also, the greater number of parts results in a greater number of failure modes compared to disc brakes. Springs can break from fatigue if not replaced along with worn brake shoes. And the drum and shoes can become damaged from scoring if various components (such as broken springs or self-adjusters) break and become loose inside the drum.|$|R
5000|$|Brake {{trained with}} Wellington {{portrait}} photographer Spencer Digby from 1945. Three {{years later he}} joined Government filmmaking body the National Film Unit as an assistant cameraman. <b>Brake</b> <b>worked</b> on 17 films at the Unit, mostly as a cameraman, occasionally as a director. Though Brake's skills with studio lighting were utilised, {{the majority of his}} work involved the NFU's heavy diet of scenic shorts, including a series of 'snow' films Brake filmed in the Southern Alps. Snows of Aorangi, one of three NFU films Brake directed, was the first New Zealand film nominated for an Academy Award, in the Best Short Subject (Live Action) category in 1959. It was beaten to the Oscar by James Algar's nature film Grand Canyon.|$|R

50|$|The countersteam brake {{is often}} {{confused}} with the counterpressure <b>brake,</b> which <b>works</b> with air, not steam, and acts as a dynamic brake. Unlike the countersteam brake, the counterpressure brake is permitted {{to be used as}} an independent braking system in its own right.|$|R
50|$|Brake fluids {{must have}} certain {{characteristics}} and meet certain quality {{standards for the}} <b>braking</b> system to <b>work</b> properly.|$|R
25|$|The {{automatic}} <b>brake</b> <b>works</b> by {{monitoring the}} speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a brake valve, and the brakes operate. The automatic brake can only be released after the train has come to a stop, and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the automatic brake is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|R
