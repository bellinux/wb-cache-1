50|$|As a group, {{the public}} {{enterprises}} performed poorly financially and relied excessively on debt financing from {{both domestic and}} foreign commercial banks. The operating and financial problems of the public enterprise sector were revealed {{in a study by}} the Bank of Portugal covering the years 1978-80. Based upon a survey of fifty-one enterprises, which represented 92 percent of the sector's VA, the analysis confirmed the debilitated financial condition of the public enterprises, as evidenced by their inadequate equity and liquidity ratios. The consolidated losses of the firms included in the survey increased from 18.3 to 40.3 million contos from 1978 to 1980, or 4.6 percent to 6.1 percent of net worth, respectively. Losses were concentrated in transportation {{and to a lesser extent}} transport equipment and materials (principally shipbuilding and ship repair). The <b>budgetary</b> <b>burden</b> of the public enterprises was substantial: enterprise transfers to the Portuguese government (mainly taxes) fell short of government receipts in the forms of subsidies and capital transfers. The largest nonfinancial state enterprises recorded (inflation-discounted) losses in the seven-year period from 1977 to 1983 equivalent to 11 percent on capital employed. Notwithstanding their substantial operating losses and weak capital structure, these large enterprises financed 86 percent of their capital investments from 1977 to 1983 through increased debt, of which two-thirds was foreign. The rapid buildup of Portugal's external debt from 1978 to 1985 was largely associated with the public enterprises.|$|E
40|$|This {{publication}} {{contains the}} summaries of three {{studies on the}} common agricultural policy of the EC, {{as well as some}} additional remarks on recent developments in that policy. The studies were written between 1979 and 1983 and are all part of a thesis called "Europe's Green Worries". The first study deals with the problems of agriculture in developed countries, with the EC reaction on these problems and with the effects of the common agricultural policy on the policy objectives. The main problem of agriculture in developed countries is that technological progress in this sector causes an increase in supply which is much larger than the increase in demand for agricultural products. This difference in growth causes in Its turn such a pressure on agricultural prices and incomes, that government intervention is considered to be necessary. The EC Intervenes mainly through price support by means of a markets and prices policy. The consequences of that policy are that the disequilibrium between supply and demand finds another outlet than through pressure on prices. Now the main symptoms of oversupply are an increase in the self-sufficiency ratio and in the <b>budgetary</b> <b>burdens</b> of the EC. The second study deals with the question to what extent some alternative policies would be more successful than the current one in achieving the policy objectives. The policy alternatives which have been studied are: deficiency payments, direct income payments to farmers and the continuation of the current price support, while the supply is controlled by means of a quota system. The study shows large differences between the policy alternatives in their Implications for the various policy objectives. When an equal level of income support under each policy alternative is assumed, then deficiency payments for quotas allocated in advance on a farm firm basis are the most attractive policy alternative for the EC economy as a whole. The reason is that the supply and demand effects of this policy alternative are very small or even zero. However, this policy alternative causes large burdens for the EC budget. Though these <b>budgetary</b> <b>burdens</b> need not be higher for products with a high self-sufficiency ratio than under the current prices policy. The reason is the rather large negative terms of trade effect of the necessary disposal of additional supply under the current policy. The third study specially deals with the disposal policy of dairy products. One of the conclusions {{of this study is that}} the terms of trade effects of additional sales of these products have become so large that each additional unit of milk produced under a system of unlimited price support burdens the EC budget with almost the same amount as the farmer receives. This explains the extreme rise of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>burdens</b> of the common dairy policy, when the milk production increases. It constitutes also the main reason for the introduction of the superlevy system in the dairy sector in 1984...|$|R
40|$|In power {{generation}} expansion planning, electric utilities have encountered the major challenge of environmental awareness whilst being concerned with <b>budgetary</b> <b>burdens.</b> The approach for selecting generating technologies should depend on {{economic and environmental}} constraint as well as externalities.

This paper presents a hybrid framework of multi-objective optimization and multi-criteria decision making to solve {{power generation}} expansion planning problems in Thailand. In this paper, CO 2 emissions and external cost are modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem. Then the analytic hierarchy process is utilized to determine thecompromised solution. For {{carbon capture and storage}} technology, CO 2 emissions can be mitigated by 74. 7 % from the least cost plan and leads to the reduction of the external cost of around 500 billion US dollars over the planning horizon.

40|$|Consider the {{following}} paradox: while sociologists, anthropologists, constitutional scholars, philosophers {{and policy makers}} may endlessly dwell on the difficulty of benchmarking or defining membership criteria for minorities, {{and a number of}} international human rights commitments are interpreted in a way which suggest that they recognize the free choice of identity, hate crimes perpetrators are rarely puzzled by the complexity of identity formation of their victims. When it comes to the ill-treatment of members of various minority groups, categorization, definition making, or classification of those minority groups is never an issue for the discriminating party. In fact, these conceptual ambiguities may even worsen protections provided for the victimized group, as they make it difficult to define or identify target groups and beneficiaries. This essay investigates the constitutional dilemma that characterizes all ethno-racial minority protection mechanisms, be they remedies, demands for collective ethno-cultural recognition, systems of preferential treatment, or protections offered from racially motivated violence or discrimination. All of these mechanisms need to institutionalize some kind of a definition for the targeted groups, and/or membership requirements within the community to be effective. The failure to do so seriously impedes the prospects for efficient legal protection, exemplified by the documented practice of “ethno-corruption”, which will be discussed later in this paper, and the reluctance to apply anti-discrimination and hate crime laws, in part due to concerns over data collection in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. Citizens in each community, as well as members of the international community, arguably have a right to properly identify the beneficiaries of affirmative action and minority rights regimes because of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>burdens</b> of these policies—not to mention the need for sustainable and transparent policy-making and enforcement schemes.

30|$|Meta-analysis of the {{institutional}} setup for DRR and CCA within the South Asian region revealed a lack of coordination and awareness among the nodal agencies, which critically limits their proper functioning. In most cases, stand-alone adaptation and disaster reduction policies were found to exist and DRR including CCA policies seemed extremely challenging due to the involvement of multiple institutions within similar kind of projects. In certain cases, duplication or even triplication in the execution of similar projects was identified, which often hindered the pace of effective execution {{in terms of both}} economy and benefit to the people. A lack of coordination also implies an excessive <b>budgetary</b> <b>burden</b> in executing similar types of projects and plans by different institutions and agencies.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{implications}} of budgetary policies for consumption and economic growth. We present a model that combines the Arrow-Romer endogenous growth model with the Blanchard-Yaari overlapping-generations model. We show that a rise in government debt, financed by lump-sum taxes, increases the share of private consumption to national income and reduces the long-run growth rate. We also show that a rise in government consumption financed by lump-sum taxes reduces both the share of private consumption in national income and the long-run growth rate. These results do not follow in infinite-horizon, representative-household models of endogenous growth. In such models the substitution of debt for tax finance does not affect consumption and the growth rate, and a balanced budget increase in government consumption crowds out private consumption one-for-one, without any effects on the growth rate. The paper examines the dynamic adjustment of consumption, growth and government debt to a temporary tax cut, and briefly discusses the empirical implications of the results. <b>Budgetary</b> Policy; <b>Burden</b> of Debt; Consumption; Endogenous Growth...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The ever {{increasing}} user demand for highly data-intensive applications is motivating cellular operators {{to provide more}} data services. However, the operators are suffering from the heavy <b>budgetary</b> <b>burden</b> of upgrading their infrastructure. Most macrocell Base Stations still connect to backhauls with capacities of less than 8 Mbps, much too low {{to be able to}} serve all voice and data users in the cell. This so-called macrocell backhaul bandwidth shortage problem is encumbering the growth of cellular data services. In this paper, we propose a novel solution, FemtoHaul, which efficiently exploits the potential of femtocells to bear the macrocell backhaul traffic by using relays, enhancing the data rates of cellular subscribers. We design a system architecture and its related signaling and scheduling strategies. Extensive simulations demonstrate that FemtoHaul can effectively serve more users and support higher data demand with the existing macrocell backhaul capacity. I...|$|E

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that political and institutional factors matter for fiscal outcomes. Following {{a review of}} the literature, this paper examines the relationship between a variety of political-institutional variables and fiscal aggregates-encompassing the overall balance as well as expenditure and revenue and their various components-across 19 industrial countries over the past two decades. It finds strong effects on fiscal policy from such factors as type of electoral system, degree of legislative or government fragmentation, and stability of government. Some of the strongest results emerge for certain components of expenditure, such as transfers, and for the balance between labor and consumption taxation. There are clear relationships between the type of political system and choice of tax and expenditure system. The paper also examines fiscal adjustment since the late 1980 s in light of these political factors, finding some evidence of a reversal in trend, but only when growth has been high or when debt has become problematic.

40|$|After Poland's {{remarkable}} {{stabilization and}} liberalization in 1990, the economy faced three related problems: high wage and pension claims, a rising number of pensioners and unemployed workers, and a budget crisis, especially in 1991 and 1992. The author studies {{the role that}} wage and pension pressures played in this crisis. He also explains {{the persistence of the}} high tax wedge that later helped overcome the budget crisis. The positive effect on revenues of higher wages and higher tax rates could not compensate for both the inevitable loss in profit taxes and the excessive growth of spending on replacement income. Counterfactuals constructed for revenue and spending show the rising number of social benefit earners (pensions, unemployment) to be responsible for much of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>burden.</b> But they also show that the better protection of social income (over other income) explains part of the burden. Part of the employment loss and social spending can be ascribed to the excessive wage recovery of late 1990 and 1991. Insiders set wages ignoring the unemployed and exploiting the pension system in a context of uncertainty about profits and productivity, {{at a time when there}} was strong popular support for the protection of replacement income. The author recommends pension reform and caution about wages: the current economic recovery should create jobs, not raise wages, he says; and ensuring equitable opportunities for all requires moderating the income claims of the best-protected groups.

40|$|Fuel subsidy {{has been}} the biggest quandaries in Indonesian economy, {{as it has been}} {{creating}} a huge opportunity costs to the economy. The subsidy is implemented to a consumer good (i. e. fuels) as oppose to targeted recipients, creating distortion in the efficient resource allocation. It was estimated about 70 % of the subsidy were received by 40 % of top income households (World Bank, 2007). Although the budget plan for the subsidy in 2011 was Rp 129. 7 trillion or 10 % of the GoI annual budget, the actual subsidy was Rp 160. 7 trillion (13. 3 % of the GoI annual budget). Indeed, no individual prefers to lose the subsidy that has been received for many years, however the Government of Indonesia (GoI) cannot maintain the subsidy policy on fuel price any longer without creating extra <b>budgetary</b> <b>burden.</b> This study use experimental approach to seek the most acceptable exit strategy of eliminating fuel subsidy scheme in Indonesia based on households’ perspective. 335 subjects participated in the experiment, ranging from those who do not own motor vehicle, those who have motor cycle(s) and those who have car(s). During the experiment, subjects were given several pair-wise choices and chose the most acceptable policy from each pair-wise policy choices. The results show that the combination of gradual elimination and earmarked reallocation scheme were the most desirable. Subject with very low and low-income background tend to be more receptive for sudden elimination of the subsidy in comparison to their counterpart from medium and high-income backgrounds. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{involvement}} of private concessionaire {{in the delivery}} of public infrastructure worldwide is apparent in reducing the <b>budgetary</b> <b>burden</b> on the government’s part specifically due to the major downturn in the global economy. Their involvement varies from concessionaire, privatization to partnerships. Looking at the most current type of project delivery approach procured around the globe, which is known as Public Private Partnerships (PPP), although the opportunities are widely opened for the private concessionaires to partake {{in the delivery of}} public infrastructure projects with numerous incentives by the government, their responses are still minimal. Their reluctance is observed due to the current scenario in the PPP implementation involving the development of monopolies by certain groups of private concessionaires in Malaysia, which consequently reduces the healthy competition among concessionaires. Therefore, this paper is materialized with the aim of determining the elements of relational contract, which can improve the current delivery of public infrastructure project and subsequently eradicate the private concessionaire’s lack of enthusiasm. Questionnaire surveys on 22 respondents of construction industry players are undertaken to determine the elements of relational contract suitable to be adopted in public infrastructure delivery in Malaysia in encouraging the {{involvement of}} private concessionaires. The results show that relational contract elements of clearly defined scope, integrated project team, mutual alignment of goals and open honest communication {{should be included in the}} relational contract elements frameworks due to its potential in overcoming the current recession of private concessionaire’s initiatives and ultimately improving the public infrastructure delivery in Malaysia...|$|E
