25|$|The International <b>Bank</b> <b>Account</b> <b>Number</b> (<b>IBAN)</b> is {{an internationally}} agreed system of {{identifying}} bank accounts across national borders {{to facilitate the}} communication and processing of cross border transactions with a reduced risk of transcription errors. It was originally adopted by the European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS), and later as an international standard under ISO 13616:1997. The current standard is ISO 13616:2007, which indicates SWIFT as the formal registrar. Initially developed to facilitate payments within the European Union, it has been implemented by most European countries and numerous countries in {{the other parts of}} the world, mainly in the Middle East and in the Caribbean. As of February 2016, 69 countries were using the IBAN numbering system.|$|E

This proposal had a degree of flexibility, which the European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS) believed would make it unworkable, and they produced a [...] "slimmed down" [...] version of the standard which, amongst other things, permitted only upper-case letters and required that the IBAN for each country have a fixed length. ISO 13616:1997 was subsequently withdrawn and replaced by ISO 13616:2003. The standard was revised again in 2007 when it was split into two parts. ISO 13616-1:2007 [...] "specifies the elements of an international <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> <b>number</b> (<b>IBAN)</b> used to facilitate the processing of data internationally in data interchange, in financial environments as well as within and between other industries" [...] but [...] "does not specify internal procedures, file organization techniques, storage media, languages, etc. {{to be used in}} its implementation". ISO 13616-2:2007 describes [...] "the Registration Authority (RA) responsible for the registry of IBAN formats that are compliant with ISO 13616-1 [...] the procedures for registering ISO 13616-compliant IBAN formats". The official IBAN registrar under ISO 13616-2:2007 is SWIFT.|$|E

50|$|The (national) bank codes {{differ from}} the {{international}} Bank Identifier Code (BIC/ISO 9362, a normalized code - also known as Business Identifier Code, Bank International Code and SWIFT code). Those countries which use International <b>Bank</b> <b>Account</b> <b>Numbers</b> (<b>IBAN)</b> have mostly integrated the bank code into the prefix of specifying <b>IBAN</b> <b>account</b> <b>numbers.</b> The <b>bank</b> codes also {{differ from the}} Bank card code (CSC).|$|R

25|$|Modular {{arithmetic}} {{is often}} used to calculate checksums that are used within identifiers. International Standard Book Number (ISBN) uses modulo 11 (if issued before 1 January, 2007) or modulo 10 (if issued on or after 1 January, 2007) arithmetic for error detection. Likewise, International <b>Bank</b> <b>Account</b> <b>Numbers</b> (<b>IBANs),</b> for example, make use of modulo 97 arithmetic to trap user input errors in <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> <b>numbers.</b> In chemistry, the last digit of the CAS registry number (a number which is unique for each chemical compound) is a check digit, which is calculated by taking the last digit of the first two parts of the CAS registry number times 1, the previous digit times 2, the previous digit times 3 etc., adding all these up and computing the sum modulo 10.|$|R

50|$|The {{overlapping}} issue between ISO 9362 and ISO 13616 {{is discussed}} in the article International <b>Bank</b> <b>Account</b> <b>Number</b> (also called <b>IBAN).</b> The SWIFT network {{does not require a}} specific format for the transaction so the identification of accounts and transaction types is left to agreements of the transaction partners. In the process of the Single Euro Payments Area the European central banks have agreed on a common format based on IBAN and BIC including an XML-based transmission format for standardized transactions; the TARGET2 is a joint gross clearing system in the European Union that does not require the SWIFT network for transmission (see EBICS). The TARGET-directory lists all the BICs of the banks that are attached to the TARGET2-network being a subset of the SWIFT-directory of BICs.|$|R

50|$|A {{universal}} payment {{identification code}} (UPIC) is an identifier (or banking address) for a <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> in the United States used to receive electronic credit payments.

The actual <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> <b>number,</b> including the <b>bank's</b> routing transit number, are masked by the UPIC. Only credit transactions to an account can be initiated with a UPIC.

Non-European banks usually accept IBANs for accounts in Europe, although they might not treat IBANs differently from other foreign <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> <b>numbers.</b> In particular, they might not check the IBAN's validity prior to sending the transfer.|$|R
50|$|The IBAN was {{originally}} developed to facilitate payments within the European Union but the format is {{flexible enough to}} be applied globally. It consists of an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, followed by two check digits that are calculated using a mod-97 technique, and Basic <b>Bank</b> <b>Account</b> <b>Number</b> (BBAN) with up to thirty alphanumeric characters.4 The BBAN includes the domestic <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> <b>number</b> and potentially routing information.

Any process towards IBAN would involve considerable changes to bank software and computer systems, and the requirement for financial institutions to adopt defined length <b>account</b> <b>numbers.</b> Outgoing international transfers must use either the SWIFT or IBAN system in use in the destination country, which would incorporate that country's format for BBAN.|$|R

5000|$|Even more {{alarming}} than the confirmation attack is the [...] "learn the remaining information attack" [...] described by Drew Perttula in 2008. This type of attack {{applies to the}} encryption of files that are only slight variations of a public document. For example, if the defender encrypts a bank form including a ten digit <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> <b>number,</b> an attacker that is aware of generic bank form format may extract defender's <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> <b>number</b> by producing <b>bank</b> forms for all possible <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> <b>numbers,</b> encrypt them and then by comparing those encryptions with defender's encrypted file deduce his <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> <b>number.</b> Note that this attack can be extended to attack {{a large number of}} targets at once (all spelling variations of a target bank customer in the example above, or even all potential bank customers), and the presence of this problem extends to any type of form document: tax returns, financial documents, healthcare forms, employment forms, etc. Also note that there is no known method for decreasing the severity of this attack -- adding a few random bytes to files as they are stored does not help, since those bytes can likewise be attacked with the [...] "learn the remaining information" [...] approach. The only effective approach to mitigating this attack is to encrypt the contents of files with a non-convergent secret before storing (negating any benefit from convergent encryption), or to simply not use convergent encryption in the first place.|$|R
