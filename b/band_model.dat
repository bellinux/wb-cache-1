25|$|The young Mueller enjoyed reading {{science fiction}} and, helped by his grandfather, {{woodworking}} – although his first model ship capsized. When he was aged 11 or 12 Mueller also built and raced model aircraft – such as gliders and rubber <b>band</b> <b>model</b> airplanes. Always curious {{about how things}} worked, he also built radios, {{following in the footsteps}} of his father. Interested in these activities, the teenage Mueller wanted to be an aeronautical engineer but discovered that where he could afford to go to school, the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy (now Missouri University of Science and Technology) in Rolla, Missouri, there was no aeronautical engineering department. They did offer mechanical engineering, so he enrolled in that program but found it discouraging and switched to electrical engineering.|$|E
500|$|Butterfield played Hohner harmonicas (and {{endorsed}} them). He {{preferred the}} diatonic ten-hole Marine <b>Band</b> <b>model.</b> He wrote a harmonica instruction book, Paul Butterfield Teaches Blues Harmonica Master Class, {{a few years}} before his death (it was not published until 1997). [...] In it, he explains various techniques, demonstrated on an accompanying CD. [...] Butterfield played mainly in cross-harp, or second position. He occasionally used a chromatic harmonica. Reportedly left-handed, he held the harmonica in a manner opposite that of a right-handed player, i.e., in his right hand, upside down (with the low notes to the right), using his left hand for muting effects.|$|E

It is found that, for the intermediate path lengths, the use of the combined Lorentz-Doppler (Voight) profile is essential in calculating the atmospheric transmittance. A brief review of <b>band</b> <b>models,</b> to approximate the absorption over certain frequency interval, is presented. Expressions for total radiative energy emergent from the atmosphere are given which, with appropriate line or <b>band</b> <b>models,</b> can be used to reduce the data obtained from radiation measurement by an instrument mounted on an aircraft or a satellite.

40|$|Mutually {{consistent}} line-by-line, narrow-band and broad-band {{infrared radiation}} models are presented for methane, a potentially important anthropogenic trace gas within the atmosphere. Comparisons of the <b>modeled</b> <b>band</b> absorptances with existing laboratory data produce the best agreement when, within the <b>band</b> <b>models,</b> spurious <b>band</b> intensities are used which {{are consistent with}} the respective laboratory data sets, but which are not consistent with current knowledge concerning the intensity of the infrared fundamental band of methane. This emphasizes the need for improved laboratory band absorptance measurements. Since, when applied to atmospheric radiation calculations, the line-by-line model does not require the use of scaling approximations, the mutual consistency of the <b>band</b> <b>models</b> provides a means of appraising the accuracy of scaling procedures. It is shown that Curtis-Godson narrow-band and Chan-Tien broad-band scaling provide accurate means of accounting for atmospheric temperature and pressure variations...|$|R
40|$|Relativistic OPW band {{calculations}} {{have been}} carried out at key points in the reduced zone for several IV-VI compounds. The band structure in the remainder of the zone has been filled in with the aid of an interpolation scheme. To our knowledge, these are the first fully relativistic first-principles band calculations for IV-VI compounds (in contrast to non-relativistic calculations supplemented by relativistic and spin-orbit coupling corrections). Our first-principles band calculations lead to physically realistic energy <b>band</b> <b>models</b> which are sufficiently accurate to account for most of the characteristic features of the experimental reflectivity spectra. It is difficult to interpret the electroreflectivity spectra unambiguously in terms of these <b>band</b> <b>models</b> but a number of plausible spectral assignments can be made. Refined energy band and optical spectrum calculations are in progress and will be reported elsewhere...|$|R
