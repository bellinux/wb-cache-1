40|$|Purpose: {{this paper}} was to {{determine}} the impact of the wide-gap welding, with increased <b>root</b> <b>face</b> gap, on structure and corrosion properties of the welded joints executed on duplex steel by one-side welding on ceramic backings. Design/methodology/approach: In the described work, experiments were conducted to welding tests for selected joints, visual examinations, non-destructive testing of welded joints, X-ray examinations, and metallographic testing of welded joints. Findings: As a result of the performed inspection, decreasing of the ferrite content with the increase of the <b>root</b> <b>face</b> gap (increase of welding heat input) was observed. The minimum measured ferrite content was not lower than 28 %, and the maximum value did not exceed 69 % (the permissible range being from 25 to 70 %). Research limitations/implications: Further studies on the impact of the wide-gap welding, with increased <b>root</b> <b>face</b> gap, on structure and corrosion properties of the welded joints are required. Practical implications: The performed tests and examinations of welded joints with <b>root</b> <b>face</b> gap ranging from 6 to 10 mm were intended for extending the standard range from 2 to 6 mm. Originality/value: The experimental program verified the testing methodology, and techniques of welding of the duplex steel with the wide-gap...|$|R

40|$|Although {{much work}} has been done on {{enumerating}} rooted planar maps since Tutte's poineering works in early 1960 s, many classes of maps with no loops or multiple edges are still untreated. In this paper, we enumerate three classes of cubic planar maps with no loops or multiple edges: 1 -connected; 2 -connected; 3 -connected and triangle-free. Research supported by NSERCC, the University of Melbourne and the Australian Research Council y Research supported by the Australian Research Council 1 1 Introduction We consider planar maps in this paper. These are connected graphs embedded in the plane. A planar map is rooted if an edge is distinguished together with a vertex on the edge and a side of the edge. The face on the distinguished side is called the <b>root</b> <b>face.</b> For planar maps, by convention the <b>root</b> <b>face</b> must be the unbounded <b>face.</b> (Thus a <b>rooted</b> planar map is equivalent to a rooted map on the sphere with arbitrary <b>root</b> <b>face.)</b> Much {{work has been}} done on enumerating rooted planar ma [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Aim The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects that various commonly used instruments have on root surface morphology, the obturating material, and the interface between the obturation and the root canal walls following root-end resection in vitro. Methodology Sixty human single-rooted teeth with fully formed apices were collected and decoronated. The root canals were instrumented, and then obturated with thermoplasticized gutta-percha using AH- 26 as the sealer. The roots were randomly divided into 12 different groups, and apical root-end resections were performed using eight different instrument configurations, and two different directions in which the bur moved across the <b>root</b> <b>face</b> in relation to its direction of rotation. Epoxy resin replicas of the resected root ends were examined using scanning electron microscopy. Results Each instrument produced a characteristic surface finish on the resected root end that mirrored its cutting profile. Irrespective of the design of the bur used, smearing and shredding of the gutta-percha across the <b>root</b> <b>face</b> occurred only when the handpiece was moved across the <b>root</b> <b>face</b> in reverse direction in relation to the direction of rotation of the bur. Conclusions To ensure minimal disruption and distortion of the root filling and to prevent shredding of the gutta-percha interface, care should be taken to ensure that the final pass of the bur across the root canal is in the correct direction in relation to its direction of rotation...|$|R

40|$|In this {{exercise}} session, we study the site percolation on the UIHPT (Uniform Infinite Half-Plane Triangulation). More precisely, {{we use the}} domain Markov property of the UIHPT to construct the so-called peeling processes and we encode information about percolation clusters with these processes. 1 Definitions and enumerative background Recall that a planar triangulation with simple boundary is a rooted planar map such that every non-root face has degree 3, and such that the <b>root</b> <b>face</b> has a simple boundary. When the <b>root</b> <b>face</b> is of degree m, it is also called a triangulation of the m-gon. By taking the local limit of finite triangulations of the m-gon as m→∞, we can generalize the notion of planar triangulation with simple boundary to include triangulations of the half-plane. Note that the boundary vertices of a triangulation of the half-plane are naturally indexed by Z, with the root vertex being of index 0. By convention, all triangulations considered below are of type II (i. e. no self-loops but may have multiple edges, c. f. exercises for lecture I). Let Mn,m be the set of all triangulations of the m-gon with n internal vertices. Let φn,m be the cardinal ofMn,m.

Further characterized is the lattice in terms of unidirectional cycles with respect to a particular <b>face</b> called the <b>root</b> <b>face.</b> It is shown how to compactly encode the entire lattice and it is also shown that the set of solutions to the min-cost flow problem forms a sublattice in the presented lattice...|$|R

The mandibular canines are slightly narrower than the maxillary canines but its crown is as long and sometimes is longer. The mandibular canines usually have only one root, but sometimes the root may be bifurcated, or have two roots.

The roots of the teeth were examined under 10 times for number, curvature, types and additional features of root canals. Deciduous mandibular first molar showed variability in root canal morphology. Four to five root canals were recorded. Majority of the teeth had 1 - 1 type of root canal anatomy, but 1 - 2 type anatomy was also reported.

40|$|AbstractIn a {{previous}} paper the author studied an enumerating power seriesΦin six variables.

The present paper arose out of the observation that the equation forΦtakes a particularly simple form when the variablesxandyof the dichromatic polynomial are each given the value 1. The value of the polynomial is then the number of spanning trees of the map concerned. In that special case a theoretical solution is obtained. It is stated in terms of a remainder obtained when a certain power series in the four remaining variables, slightly transformed, is divided by a certain polynomial...|$|R
