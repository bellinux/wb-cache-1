After these mishaps Nansen thoroughly overhauled his equipment, minimised the travelling stores, recalculated weights and reduced the convoy to three sledges, <b>before</b> <b>giving</b> the order to start again.

5|$|The {{first draft}} of the game placed a figurehead similar to Kreia {{as the leader of}} a matriarchs ruling 's world, which the player was sent to free. This draft was made before Obsidian had played the , due to LucasArts needing Obsidian to sign a {{contract}} <b>before</b> <b>giving</b> them copies of Knights of the Old Republic, and after they had played it the draft was discarded.

5|$|Without {{ultrasound}} {{or other}} special tools, determining if a sheep is pregnant is difficult. Ewes only begin to visibly show a pregnancy {{about six weeks}} <b>before</b> <b>giving</b> birth, so shepherds often rely {{on the assumption that}} a ram will impregnate all the ewes in a flock. However, by fitting a ram with a chest harness called a marking harness that holds a special crayon (or raddle, sometimes spelled reddle), ewes that have been mounted are marked with a color. Dye may also be directly applied to the ram's brisket. This measure is not used in flocks where wool is important, since the color of a raddle contaminates it.|$|E
5|$|According to Sorrell, {{the first}} design {{proposal}} for the game had the working title ‘Dead Man Dan’ and described a game that was initially a fusion of Capcom's Ghost'n Goblins combined with the art style of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. As development progressed, lead artist Wilson pushed the game into more of a Zelda role playing game-influenced direction {{as opposed to the}} original arcade-style concept. Looking to attract a major publishing deal, Millennium Interactive initially began working on multiple platforms including Windows and the Sega Saturn <b>before</b> <b>giving</b> Sony of Europe a working demo of the game. Impressed by the progress, Sony signed MediEvil to be an exclusive PlayStation game and commissioned SCE Cambridge Studio as Sony's second studio in the United Kingdom, after Psygnosis. During the production of the demo, there was a programmer for each platform. Millennium were having financial difficulties and wanted to secure a publisher quickly. Sega and Microsoft were also interested in the game.|$|E

5|$|Although {{both were}} invited, neither Hirst nor Rhodes toured Australia {{in the winter}} of 1901–02 with Archie MacLaren's team, as the Yorkshire {{committee}} wanted both players to be well rested before the new season. Hirst was statistically less successful in 1902, but he nevertheless returned to the Test team. The summer was very wet, resulting in many rain-affected pitches, known as sticky wickets, which favoured slower bowlers and made batting difficult. Hirst scored 1,413 runs in the season, at an average of 31.11 with two centuries. He took fewer wickets than the previous year, partly as he was often used for a few overs early in an innings by Yorkshire <b>before</b> <b>giving</b> way to slow bowlers Rhodes and Schofield Haigh, who topped the national first-class bowling averages for the season. In total, Hirst took 83 wickets at an average of 20.33.|$|E
5|$|At {{the drivers}} meeting held the Friday before the event, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Race Director Charlie Whiting {{announced}} that any potential blocking manoeuvres that {{interfered with the}} World Championship battle {{would result in a}} driver being shown a waved black and white flag, <b>before</b> <b>giving</b> a black flag to signal disqualification from the race. The penalty also had a potential ban for up to three Formula One World Championship events for any driver found to have breached the new ruling. Ralf Schumacher agreed with the penalties. However, McLaren team principal Ron Dennis was more vocal in opposing the new rules as he believed they were arbitrary and were against choosing team tactics. He was also unhappy with the inclusion of Italian lawyer Roberto Causo as a race steward because Dennis held the view that any decision would be biased towards Ferrari.|$|E
