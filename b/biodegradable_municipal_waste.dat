40|$|Soil {{application}} of biogas residues (BGRs) {{is important for}} closing nutrient cycles. This study examined the efficiency and impact on yields and yield formation of solid-liquid separated residues from <b>biodegradable</b> <b>municipal</b> and industrial <b>wastes</b> (bio-waste) in comparison to complete BGRs, nitrification inhibitor, agricultural BGRs, mineral fertilizer and unfertilized plots as control. The experiment was set up as a randomized block design on silt loam Cambisol. Biogas residues from four biogas plants were evaluated. Plants per m², ears per plant, grains per ear and thousand grain weight (TGW) were measured at harvest. Fertilization with BGRs resulted in similar biomass yields compared with mineral fertilizer. Mineral fertilizer (71 dt/ha) and plots fertilized with liquid fraction (59 - 62 dt/ha) indicated a trend to higher yields than solid fraction or complete BGR due to its high ammonia content. Liquid fractions and fraction with nitrification inhibitor induced fewer plants per m² than corresponding solid and complete variants due to a potential phytotoxicity of high NH 4 -N concentration during germination. However, barley on plots fertilized with liquid fraction compensated the disadvantages at the beginning during the vegetation period and induced higher grain yields than solid fraction. This was attributable to a higher number of ears per plant and grains per ear. In conclusion, BGRs from <b>biodegradable</b> <b>municipal</b> and industrial <b>wastes</b> {{can be used for}} soil fertilization and replace considerable amounts of mineral fertilizer. Our study showed that direct {{application of}} the liquid fraction of BGR is the most suitable strategy to achieve highest grain yields.

Recycling of food waste contributes to the UK’s reuse, recycling and composting targets and can help local authorities boost plateauing rates whilst encouraging landfill diversion. This study explored the reasons for differences {{in the provision of}} food waste collections, using two comparable local authorities, one with a collection in Wales (Cardiff), and the other absent of such service in England (Southampton). A PESTLE analysis investigated the political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental impacts of separate food waste collections. The greenhouse gas impacts of the collection and treatment systems of MSW in both cities were estimated for 2012 / 13. Results showed significant policy and legislative differences between devolved governments, that separate food waste collections can save local authorities significant sums of money and substantially reduce greenhouse gas impacts. A survey of one hundred respondents in each city aimed to understand attitudes and behaviours towards recycling, food waste segregation, cooking and purchasing habits.

40|$|The {{extensive}} use of nanoparticles (NPs) has started receiving increased attention because of the knowledge gaps regarding their fate in {{the environment and the}} possible impact on the environment and human health. The production of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 -NPs) is increasing and it is expected that, due to their great number of applications, their concentration in waste streams will increase in the future. The presence of NPs in waste streams may affect the treatment process (e. g., composting) and, if they are not successfully removed from the waste streams, their presence in the treated waste (e. g., compost) may present an environmental risk. Composting of the <b>biodegradable</b> fractions of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> (MSW) is a widely used waste management practice, mainly because it is a cost-effective treatment technology and the final product (i. e., compost) presents several benefits to the environment, particularly as a soil conditioner. The overall aim of this thesis is to assess the effect of Ag-TiO 2 NPs and AgNPs that may be present in the <b>biodegradable</b> fractions of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> on composting and subsequent soil application of compost. For that purpose in-vessel composting of artificial <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> contaminated with commercial nanoparticles was investigated at laboratory scale, simulating a range of relevant concentration levels. Subsequently, the fate of NPs present in mature compost use as a top-layer soil conditioner was investigated using a column approach at laboratory scale. The toxicity effect of NPs present mature compost on plant growth was further investigated. The impact of NPs during composting was assessed by monitoring the temporal dynamics of organic matter (OM) using Excitation Emission Matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. The fate of NPs following application of contaminated mature compost as a top-soil conditioner and potential release to groundwater was investigated using a column leaching experiment while the phytotoxicity of mature compost contaminated with NPs was assessed using a seed germination bioassay. Finally, to investigate further possible environmental impacts due to the application of mature compost contaminated with NPs to soils, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted. The impact of commercial Ag-TiO 2 NPs and AgNPs on the in-vessel composting of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> was investigated over 21 days, using initial concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg Ag / kg of OM.

40|$|The {{emerging}} biofuel industry demands {{large amount}} of biomass feedstock. Although commercial ethanol has been produced from primary biomass sources such as corns, the global food crisis caused {{by the use of}} primary biomass has been raised. Thus, lignocellulosic biomass, known as second generation of biomass, has become a promising source for ethanol production. However, the more complex structure requires more advance technology. MSW with more than 60 % of biodegradable composition, as one of the promising biomass sources has the potential benefits of replacing primary biomass and preventing environment from MSW pollution. In this paper, three major <b>biodegradable</b> <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> (BMSW) components: kitchen organic waste (KOW), green organic waste (GOW) and paper and card waste (PCW), are classified and characterised according to substrate composition, cellulose crystallinity, bulk density and particle size.

Other chemical composition such as lignin and hemicellulose indicates how easy of each model waste can be converted. These contents are also important information when selecting pretreatment methods and conversion process conditions in the following steps. Based on the comprehensive understanding of biomass structures and compositions, studies look into the effects of substrate properties (such crystallinity, presence of lignin and cellulose content on process performances during enzymatic hydrolysis adsorption.

During 1970 s it was found that aquatic weeds and other phytomass, if anaerobically digested, also produced similarly combustible 'bio' gas. It raised great hopes that anaerobic digestion of phytomass will also enable generation of biogas that too on a much larger scale than is possible with animal manure. This, it was hoped, would also provide a means for utilizing weeds, crop <b>wastes,</b> and <b>biodegradable</b> <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> which otherwise cause environmental pollution. It appeared to be a 'no lose' possibility; it was hoped that soon the problems of weeds (and other biosolid wastes) as well as energy shortage, would vanish. At that time there was little realization of the global warming (GW) potential of methane nor of the fact that natural degradation of phytomass in the environment is causing massive quantities of GW gas emission. Hence, at that time, the potential benefits from anaerobic digestion of phytomass were perceived only in terms of pollution control and energy generation. But four decades have since elapsed and there is still no economically viable technology with which weeds and phytowastes can be gainfully converted to energy. This paper takes a look at what has happened and why. It also points towards the possibility of success finally emerging on the horizon.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} program Functional Compost is to develop and test compost, which have been enriched with chitin, for plant growth promoting properties and to recognise specific mechanisms. Two types of compost were included in the program: source separated <b>biodegradable</b> <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> compost (DM = 62 %) and garden and park waste compost (DM = 66 %). Chitin was added in trace amounts during the maturity phase, combined with two levels of trace amounts immediately before adding the compost to the growth medium. The research program includes several parallel experiments. In experiment I, compost (20 vol. %) was added to soil (no plants) and incubated at 15 C for 5 month, under regular determination of microbial respiration and gross and net N mineralization. There was a significant increase in respiration due to chitin enrichment, which could not be explained by the amount of C derived from the chitin, which therefore suggest a priming effect. The N analyses are still being processed in the laboratory, but data are expected to be available at the conference. In experiment II, compost was mixed with sand, put into pots in a climate chamber, and spring barley seeds infected with Fusarium culmorum were sown in the pots. After 3 weeks of growth, the health of the plants was determined, and the chitinase activity in the sand was measured. The health of the plants and the chitinase activity was significantly higher in the treatments receiving <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> compared to the treatments receiving garden waste compost. However, there was no clear effect of the chitin enrichment. Additionally, the microbial community structure of the two types of compost, with and without early chitin, was determined by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE).

40|$|Purpose. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the optimum way of recovering energy from the <b>biodegradable</b> fractions of <b>municipal</b> <b>waste.</b> A part-life cycle study was carried out on the following wastes; paper, food waste, garden waste, wood, non-recyclable mixed <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> and refuse derived fuel. The energy recovery processes considered were incineration, gasification, combustion in dedicated plant, anaerobic digestion and combustion in a cement kiln. Methods. The LCA was carried out using WRATE, an LCA tool designed specifically for waste management studies. Additional information on waste composition, waste collection and the performance of the energy recovery processes was obtained from a number of UK-based sources. The results take account of the energy displaced by the waste to energy processes and also the benefits obtained by the associated recycling of digestates, metals and aggregates as appropriate. Results and discussion. For all the waste types considered the maximum benefits in terms of climate change and non-renewable resource depletion would be achieved by using the waste in a cement kiln as a substitute fuel for coal. When considering the impacts in terms of human toxicity, aquatic ecotoxicity, acidification and eutrophication, direct combustion with energy recovery was the best option. The results were found to be highly sensitive to the efficiency of the energy recovery process and the conventional fuel displaced by the recovered energy. Conclusions and recommendations. This study has demonstrated that LCA can be used to determine the benefits and burdens associated with recovering energy from <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> fractions. However, the findings were restricted by the lack of reliable data on the performance of waste gasification and anaerobic digestion systems and on the burdens arising from collecting the wastes. It is recommended that further work is carried out to address these data gaps. ...|$|R
