5|$|The skull {{generally}} {{resembles that}} of the brown-tailed mongoose, but the rostrum (front part) is <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> deep, the nasal bones are <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> short, and {{the region of the}} palate is broad. The mandible (lower jaw) is robust and shows a high, steeply rising coronoid process (a projection {{at the back of the}} bone). Statistical analysis of measurements of the skulls and teeth strongly separates S.durrelli from specimens of the brown-tailed mongoose.|$|E

Anairetes parulus aequatorialis tends to be browner than the nominate subspecies in its upperparts, with <b>broader</b> <b>and</b> more extensive breast streaks <b>and</b> <b>broader</b> <b>and</b> more distinct white wingbars. A. p. patagonicus has more variation from the nominate subspecies as it is paler gray overall, particularly on the crown, and the wingbars and breast streaks are <b>broader</b> <b>and</b> more distinct.

5|$|In 1986 Voyager 2 {{detected}} a <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> faint sheet of material inward of ring 6. This ring {{was given the}} temporary designation 1986U2R. It had a normal optical depth of 10−3 or less and was extremely faint. It was visible only in a single Voyager 2 image. The ring was located between 37,000 and 39,500km from the centre of Uranus, or only about 12,000km above the clouds. It was not observed again until 2003–2004, when the Keck telescope found a <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> faint sheet of material just inside ring 6. This ring was dubbed the ζ ring. However, {{the position of the}} recovered ζ ring differs significantly from that observed in 1986. Now it is situated between 37,850 and 41,350km from the centre of the planet. There is an inward gradually fading extension reaching to at least 32,600km, or possibly even to 27,000km—to the atmosphere of Uranus. These extensions are labelled as the ζc and ζcc rings respectively.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the braincase is high, the {{zygomatic}} arches (cheekbones) are <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> squared, and the incisive foramina, which perforate {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} broad. The upper incisors are orthodont, with their cutting edge nearly vertical. Morphometrically, the skull of O.peninsulae is sharply distinct from other western Mexican Oryzomys.|$|E

5|$|The <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> disorganized remnant low {{remained}} nearly stationary {{due to a}} {{ridge of}} high pressure to its north. Residual convection within the remnants of Henri remained disorganized, but forecasters kept watch for the potential for redevelopment.

5|$|The head is {{long and}} strong, with a convex profile and thick, long ears. The neck {{is long and}} the {{shoulders}} are sloping. The chest is <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> deep, the withers prominent, the back long and <b>broad,</b> <b>and</b> the hindquarters strong. The legs are well developed and powerful, with large joints. The Poitevin has large hooves, an advantage in wet environments, as an adaptation to the alternately hard and waterlogged marshes upon which it developed. The lower legs are well feathered, and the mane and tail are long and thick. The Poitevin is gentle, calm and robust. Historically the breed {{has been known for}} its slow movement and disinterest in pulling, although it can produce significant power if necessary. The breed enjoys human contact, and shows intelligence, although it can also be stubborn. Prolonged effort is its weak point, as the Poitevin sometimes lack endurance.|$|E
5|$|The pigeye shark {{is a very}} robust-bodied {{species with}} a short, <b>broad,</b> <b>and</b> rounded snout. The small and {{circular}} eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The anterior rims of the nostrils bear medium-sized flaps of skin. The mouth forms a wide arch and has barely noticeable furrows at the corners. There are 11–13 (usually 12) upper and 10–12 (usually 11) lower tooth rows on each side; in addition, there are single rows of tiny teeth at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> triangular with serrated edges; those in the lower jaw are slightly narrower, more upright, and more finely serrated than those in the upper. The five pairs of gill slits are of moderate length.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold front}} moved off the East Coast of the United States on July 16 and stalled {{off the coast}} of North Carolina. It {{gradually}} decayed into a surface low pressure trough, and developed into two disturbances; one was centered 290miles (490km) south-southeast of Cape Cod and another was located 200miles (320km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The first low quickly organized into an unnamed tropical storm, and the other area initially remained <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> ill-defined. However, by July 18, the system became much better organized with improved banding features, and the area developed into Tropical Depression Two while located 220miles (355km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras.|$|E

5|$|Adult dusky sharks have a <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> varied diet, {{consisting}} {{mostly of}} bony fishes, sharks and rays, and cephalopods, but also occasionally crustaceans, sea stars, bryozoans, sea turtles, marine mammals, carrion, and garbage. This species is viviparous with a three-year reproductive cycle; females bear litters of 314 young after a gestation period of 2224 months, after {{which there is}} a year of rest before they become pregnant again. Females are capable of storing sperm for long periods, as their encounters with suitable mates may be few and far between due to their nomadic lifestyle and low overall abundance. Dusky sharks are one of the slowest-growing and latest-maturing sharks, not reaching adulthood until around 20 years of age.|$|E
5|$|After Elverson's {{death in}} 1911, his son {{by his wife}} Sallie Duvall, James Elverson Jr. took charge. Under Elverson Jr., the {{newspaper}} continued to grow, eventually needing to move again. Elverson Jr. bought land at <b>Broad</b> <b>and</b> Callowhill Streets and built the eighteen-story Elverson Building, {{now known as the}} Inquirer Building. The first Inquirer issue printed at the building came out on July 13, 1925. Elverson Jr. died a few years later in 1929 and his sister, Eleanor Elverson, Mrs. Jules Patenôtre, took over.|$|E
5|$|As it tracked northward, {{the storm}} failed to {{organize}} at first, {{due to the}} influence of an upper-level low to its south. The circulation became <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> elongated, as well as removed from the deepest convection. However, after moving away from the low, the convection became better organized and more associated with the convection. After some initial slow organization continued, an area of deep convection developed over the center midday on September 20. An eye developed within the convection, and late on September 20 Jeanne re-attained hurricane status about 350mi (570km) east-northeast of the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas.|$|E

5|$|Brunel and Gooch both {{gave their}} {{locomotives}} names to identify them, but the standard-gauge companies {{that became a}} part of the GWR used numbers. Until 1864 the GWR therefore had named broad-gauge locomotives and numbered standard-gauge ones. From the time of Armstrong's arrival all new locomotives– both <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> standard– were given numbers, including broad-gauge ones that had previously carried names when they were acquired from other railways. Dean introduced a policy in 1895 of giving passenger tender locomotives both numbers and names. Each batch was given names with a distinctive theme, for example kings for the 6000 class and castles for the 4073 class.|$|E
5|$|Hawaiian {{monk seals}} mainly prey on reef {{dwelling}} bony fish, {{but they also}} prey on cephalopods and crustaceans. Juveniles and sub-adults prey more on smaller octopus species, such as Octopus leteus and O. hawaiiensis, nocturnal octopi species, and eels than do adult Hawaiian monk seals. Adult seals feed mostly on larger octopus species such as O. cyanea. Hawaiian monk seals have a <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> diverse diet due to foraging plasticity which allows them to be opportunistic predators that feed {{on a wide variety}} of available prey. Tiger sharks and Galapagos sharks are both predators of the Hawaiian Monk Seal.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Charles Horton Peck {{described}} the variety magna from material collected in North Elba, New York.
