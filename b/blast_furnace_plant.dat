The Glebe coke ovens were extended to their maximum number of 141 in 1953 and plans for No. 6 coke oven battery were formulated shortly after. These were to be built on old quarry workings {{to the north of}} the Open-Hearth building and enough land was levelled to accommodate a complete <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>plant</b> as well as for the coke ovens by-products plant and gasholder.

5000|$|Just over a mile {{east in the}} Rother Valley {{below the}} village of Fence a {{colliery}} was commenced in 1842. This colliery was bought and the Fence Colliery Company founded in 1862. In 1870 this company acquired Orgreave from the Sorby family and in 1875 its Directors leased land in the area from the Duke of Norfolk. In the same year the Fence Colliery Company was renamed Rother Vale Collieries Limited, owning Orgreave and Fence collieries, later sinking a new colliery at Treeton. Fence colliery was connected underground to Orgreave from 1887 and coal was drawn there from 1904. [...] Following the First World War Orgreave was acquired by the United Steel Companies who used the coal obtained to supply the new Orgreave Coking and By Products plant. Metallurgical coke was supplied from here to United Steel’s <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>plant</b> at Scunthorpe. From 1922 coke oven gas was supplied to the Sheffield Gas Company, this continuing until the advent of gas from below the North Sea.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{integrated}} steelworks a large {{fraction of}} total CO 2 is emitted {{from the power}} plant, where carbon- rich <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> gas (BFG) is burned to produce electricity {{by means of a}} steam cycle or a gas-steam combined cycle. The aim of the present paper is to assess the potential of Sorption Enhanced Water Gas Shift (SEWGS) process for CO 2 capture from <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> gas. Firstly, a reference combined cycle applied to <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> steel <b>plant</b> is defined. Mass flow rate and composition of the steel plant off-gas used as fuel in the combined cycle have been derived from a large integrated steel plant. Then, the application of the SEWGS process is investigated and compared to a reference monoethanolamine (MEA) -based post-combustion absorption option. Two different SEWGS plant layouts are proposed together with two different sorbents. SEWGS achieves 85 % of CO 2 avoided with electric efficiency of 39 % with the advanced sorbent...|$|R

40|$|This thesis proposes design {{principles}} {{and a program}} for site of the Carrie <b>Blast</b> <b>Furnace</b> <b>Plant,</b> a National Historic Landmark in Pittsburgh's Monongahela Valley. The Redevelopment Authority of Allegheny County intends to redevelop this 168 -acre former industrial site in the near future. In anticipation of this regionally important redevelopment project, this thesis considers the philosophical commitments of historic preservation, weighs economic growth imperatives, explores how the Carrie Furnaces {{could be made to}} cultivate public memory of industrialism, and examines competing visions of significance, authenticity, and interpretation of heritage sites, particularly in the context of deindustrialization. Four cases studies of internationally renowned projects demonstrate best practices in the redevelopment of historic blast furnace plants, ironworks, steelworks, and collieries. The Duisburg-Nord Landscape Park and Zollverein Park in Germany, the Belval City of Science project in Luxembourg, and the Parque Fundidora in Mexico all provide lessons in the preservation and adaptive reuse of derelict industrial infrastructure. Though their contexts differ, these four cases offer a common set of best practices to guide the Carrie Furnaces project. First, through designs and programs, these projects interpret the stories of industrial heritage sites for contemporary audiences, thereby cultivating public memory. Second, these projects' adaptive reuse of historic structures and spaces creates new, contemporary relationships between the sites and their various public audiences. This, as well as the fact that the designs are inspired by site-specific characteristics and are decidedly of their places and times, imparts authenticity. Third, these projects promote local economic revitalization through mixed-use development that engages broad constituencies. Finally, the projects use elements that pay homage to the industrial forms, materials, and culture that characterize their places. This paper's proposed development program and design for the Carrie Furnaces site preserves the site's "ethos of industry" through a 21 st century manufacturing and tourism program that interprets the Carrie <b>Blast</b> <b>Furnace</b> <b>Plant</b> as a site of historic, vertically-integrated iron and steel production for the contemporary public consciousness. This program also promotes multi-sectoral economic growth, reconnects ailing nearby communities to the site, and conserves the material and cultural aesthetics of steel production, labor, thrift, and enterprise that made industrial Pittsburgh the center of American heavy manufacturing. by Sunny Menozzi.

The research is subdivided according to plant types as given in the 4 th Federal Pollution Control Directive. In detail, it deals with coke oven plants (item 1. 11, appendix of the 4 th Federal Pollution Control Directive), sinter plants (item 3. 1), <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>plants</b> (item 3. 2), basic oxygen and electric <b>furnace</b> steelmaking <b>plants</b> (item 3. 3) and rolling mills (item 3. 6). It is the aim of this report to increase the transparency for iron and steel industry plants with regard to residues, methods available for avoidance, utilisation and recycling of these residues as well as respective economic parameters. This report focuses on the process specific residues, which are problematic due to their amount (slags) or their composition (dusts and sludges). For these residues, process integrated measures for avoidance and recycling methods for utilisation are analysed in detail with the technically and economically influential parameters. The results lead to a presentation of potentials for avoidance and utilisation for the plant types examined, for generated residues as well as secondary raw materials generated during recycling.
