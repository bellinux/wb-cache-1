50|$|Rage Syndrome, {{also known}} as Sudden Onset Aggression or (SOA) or Avalanche of Rage Syndrome, is a rare but serious <b>behavioural</b> <b>problem</b> that has been {{reported}} most commonly in the English Springer Spaniel but also {{in a variety of}} other dog breeds. It is often misdiagnosed as it can be confused with other forms of aggression. It is thought to be genetic in origin and is inheritable. A variety of treatments are available, but will need to be tailored to the individual needs of the specific dog. The term rage syndrome is attributed to Dr. Roger A. Mugford, an English animal behaviour consultant.|$|E
50|$|Cognitive {{behavioural}} therapy is a therapy {{that works with}} irrational thinking towards a specific situation. The key {{here is that the}} person may have not had that specific <b>behavioural</b> <b>problem</b> their whole life, and allowing them to view the event with a new perspective can change their behaviour. This is done differently from psychoanalytic therapy by exposing the patient to the stimulus they are afraid of. Through this exposure, they can unlearn any patterns of thought they had towards it by realizing that they are safe, referred to as extinction. Although, studies have shown that certain stimuli can cue a spontaneous recovery if there was not a full extinction of the associated perception to a memory.|$|E
40|$|Aims To {{examine the}} {{associations}} between being overweight and <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> at ages 5 and 14. Methods Birth cohort study of 2875 {{individuals who were}} born in Brisbane between 1981 and 1984 and who were followed up at ages 5 and 14 years. <b>Behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> were defined as scoring above the 90 th centile on Achenbach 2 ̆ 7 s child behavioural checklist. Results In cross-sectional analyses there was no association between being overweight and <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> in either females at age 5. At age 14 females who were overweight {{were more likely than}} those who were normal weight to experience <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems.</b> However, there was no association between being overweight and <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> at age 14 among males. The prevalence of <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> increased linearly across the distribution of body mass index in females at age 14. In prospective analyses, among participants who had no <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> at age 5, there was no association between being overweight at age 5 and <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> at age 14 in either sex. Females who were overweight at age 5 and normal weight at age 14 had reduced odds of <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> at age 14. Conclusions Among adolescent females there is a positive linear association between body size and <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems.</b> However, no such association was found in adolescent males, or in either sex at age 5 years, and in prospective analyses being overweight at age 5 was not associated with <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> in either sex at age 14...|$|R
40|$|Aims: This study aims {{to clarify}} the {{incidence}} and nature of <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> in children with PLI using a prognostic design in mainstream education. This design should provide valuable insights into the general relationship between PLI and various <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems.</b> Methods & Procedures: Teachers completed the Children's Communication Checklist (CCC) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and provided additional data for a sample of 1364 children aged 4 years. Outcomes & Results: Within the community sample, pragmatic competence is highly correlated with <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems.</b> Pragmatic competence is a good predictor of <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems,</b> and once pragmatic competence is accounted for, structural language abilities do not predict <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems.</b> Children with pragmatic language impairment often show <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems,</b> largely of an externalizing nature. The most prominent problems are hyperactivity {{and the lack of}} prosocial behaviour, which reach clinical levels for this group. However, all problem levels are elevated compared with normally developing children. Conclusions & Implications: Young children with PLI show a wide variety of <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems.</b> Early assessment of pragmatic competence may benefit early detection of children at risk of <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems.</b> Furthermore, due to the relationship between pragmatic competence, <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> and possible underlying disorders such as autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), early assessment of pragmatic competence may also provide an early marker for the detection of autism or ADHD...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> of {{children}} with specific language impairments (SLI) were explored. 'Specific language impairments' refers to problems in language production or language comprehension {{that can not be}} explained by the presence of other problems, such as hearing impairments or cognitive developmental problems. The language problem is the only developmental problem of the child. Several studies indicate that children with language impairments are at risk for having <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems.</b> However, a broad range of percentages of <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> in these children are mentioned and the studies show a great variety in age {{of the children in the}} sample, type of language problems and materials to assess <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems.</b> In our study we were interested in the extent and type of <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> in children with SLI in the ages of 8 to 12 years. Furthermore,the relation between specific language impairments and <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> was explored. ...|$|R
50|$|The cognitional {{development}} of puppies {{can be affected}} when the critical period of socialization is disrupted. Physiological consequences of this period not occurring can lead to puppies maturing to adults who {{are not able to}} react appropriately to new environments, situations or people. Additionally, behavioural issues can arise. Aggression, avoidance and fear {{are just some of the}} implications that can arise from a puppy not achieving the critical period of socialization. It is estimated that one in four adult dogs have at least one <b>behavioural</b> <b>problem.</b> Dogs are the animal which is typically the most closely attached to humans, developing tightly wound relationships with people. Therefore, it is crucial for the safety of both parties that there is adequate training in place.|$|E
5000|$|Feather pecking is a <b>behavioural</b> <b>problem</b> {{that occurs}} most {{frequently}} amongst domestic hens reared for egg production, {{although it does}} occur in other poultry such as pheasants, turkeys, ducks and is sometimes seen in farmed ostriches. [...] Feather pecking occurs when one bird repeatedly pecks at the feathers of another. The levels of severity are recognised as gentle and severe. Gentle feather pecking {{is considered to be}} normal investigatory behaviour where the feathers of the recipient are hardly disturbed and therefore does not represent a problem. In severe feather pecking, however, the feathers of the recipient are grasped, pulled at and sometimes removed. This is painful for the receiving bird and can lead to trauma of the skin or bleeding, which in turn can lead to cannibalism and death.|$|E
50|$|The {{differences}} between a dog <b>behavioural</b> <b>problem</b> {{and a dog}} training problem {{may be difficult for}} some dog owners to understand, {{due to the lack of}} a formal definition. At the same time, the dog training techniques utilised by dog trainers and behaviourists may often compete when considering which practitioner is better qualified to meet the dog's or owner's needs. The disciplines of dog trainers who follow a behavioural approach, informed by the study of the science of behaviour modification, is often juxtaposed against dog trainers who present themselves as experts at solving behavioural problems. The discussion and assessment, for some, may be more about appropriate methods and tools, rather than use of the term behaviourist. It is thought that dog trainers who study behaviour, tend to refrain from referring to themselves as behaviourists, because they are aware that the title would be inappropriate.|$|E
40|$|Background: Inverse {{associations}} of fetal growth with <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> in childhood have been repeatedly reported, suggesting {{long-term effects of}} the prenatal developmental environment on behaviour later in life. However, no study so far has examined effects on temperament and potential developmental pathways. Temperamental traits may be particularly susceptible to neurodevelopmental alterations, and they are linked to <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems.</b> Therefore, we tested for {{associations of}} fetal growth with <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> in children and tested if temperament mediated such effects. Methods: 139 mother-child pairs were recruited in early pregnancy. Weight, head circumference and gestational age were measured at birth, and the mother reported on their child’s <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> and temperament at age 7 to 9 years. Results: Birth weight and head circumference at birth adjusted for gestational age (i. e. fetal growth) were inversely associated with hyperactivity and total <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems,</b> and positively associated with the temperamental trait Effortful Control. Path analyses showed that Effortful Control mediated the effects of fetal growth on hyperactivity and total <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems.</b> Conclusions: Our results suggest that an adverse fetal environment is associated with <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> in childhood, in particular in those children that show a low capacity for attentional and behavioural regulation. An adverse fetal environment might induce vulnerability for <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems,</b> or it might induce changes in temperament and <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> independently, representing a common cause. Pathways {{are likely to be}} based on long lasting neurodevelopmental alterations due to prenatal adversity...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} value of health and <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> at 8 weeks as {{predictors}} of <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> at 8 months in a whole year birth cohort.  STUDY DESIGN—Prospective birth cohort study.  SETTING—The socially and ethnically diverse city of Coventry.  MAIN OUTCOME—Parent reported <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> at 8 months.  METHOD—Parent reported infant health and behaviour data were collected, using a validated questionnaire administered by the family health visitor at 8 weeks and 8 months, on 1541 infants participating in the Coventry cohort study. Sociodemographic data were collected at the health visitor's initial visit. Unadjusted relative risks (with 95 % confidence intervals (CI)) of behaviour problems at 8 months by sociodemographic variables and health and <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> at 8 weeks were estimated. Adjustment for confounding was made by logistic regression.  RESULTS—Infants reported to have <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> at 8 weeks had a significant risk of parent reported <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> at 8 months (adjusted relative risk, 3. 44; 95 % CI, 1. 95 to 6. 09) after adjustment for other health outcomes and sociodemographic factors. Of infants with <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> by 8 weeks of age, 19. 1 % {{were reported to have}} <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> at 8 months.  CONCLUSIONS—Infants whose parents report behaviour problems by 8 weeks of age are at higher risk of <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> at 8 months. However, despite the higher risk, the proportions of infants identified by behaviour at 8 weeks were too small for the early outcomes to be useful as predictors of behaviour at 8 months in the whole infant population. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Specific {{language}} impairment (SLI) {{is diagnosed}} {{when a child}} shows isolated structural language problems. The diagnosis of pragmatic language impairment (PLI) is given to children who show difficulties {{with the use of}} language in context. Unlike children with SLI, these children tend to show relatively intact structural language skills while they do exhibit clear communicative deficits. There is hardly any research on the relationship between pragmatic competence and <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems.</b> Existing research suggests a strong relationship, but has only been executed on clinical SLI samples. Moreover, it is not known whether pragmatic language problems are related to specific types of <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems.</b> Aims: This study aims to clarify the incidence and nature of <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> in children with PLI using a prognostic design in mainstream education. This design should provide valuable insights into the general relationship between PLI and various <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems.</b> Methods & Procedures: Teachers completed the Children's Communication Checklist (CCC) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and provided additional data for a sample of 1364 children aged 4 years.

5000|$|Although {{feather pecking}} occurs in all {{commercial}} housing systems used for egg laying hens, {{it is often}} more prevalent or severe in loose flock systems because it is less easy to control and can spread more rapidly. Prevalence figures range between 57 and 86% of free-range flocks and 99% of hens within a flock can be affected. [...] The UK national flock of egg laying hens is currently (2011) approximately 33 million birds of which approximately 10 million are free-range. This indicates that 5.5 million free-range hens/year {{are likely to be}} affected by feather pecking. It has been estimated that 4% of hens on free-range farms die because of feather pecking, representing 220,000 deaths each year in the UK alone due to this <b>behavioural</b> <b>problem.</b> EU legislation (Council Directive 1999/74/EC) will ban battery or conventional cages in 2012 meaning that many producers will change to using free-range systems, possibly exacerbating this welfare problem until we learn effective methods of its control - see Defra's [...] "A Guide To The Practical Management of Feather Pecking & Cannibalism in Free Range Laying Hens" ...|$|E

40|$|Issues addressed: Improved {{parenting}} {{competence is}} recognised {{as an effective}} way of improving {{the health and well-being}} of children. In order to develop effective parenting policies and programs, information about the attitudes, concerns and child-rearing practices of parents is needed. This survey sought to describe the experience of Queensland parents. Method: Parents with a child under 12 years (n= 1218) participated in a random telephone survey that included structured questions about parenting and child behaviour. Results: More than 25 per cent of parents perceived that their eldest child under 12 years had an emotional or <b>behavioural</b> <b>problem</b> in the past 6 months. In general, parents who believed that their eldest child had an emotional or <b>behavioural</b> <b>problem</b> were less confident in their parenting, less satisfied in their relationship with their partner and disciplined their child more frequently than parents who thought their child did not have an emotional or <b>behavioural</b> <b>problem.</b> Only one third of parents who perceived that their child had an emotional or <b>behavioural</b> <b>problem</b> had sought help for their child. Conclusions: A significant number of Queensland parents perceived problems with their child 2 ̆ 7 s behaviour or emotional development. Overall, only a small percentage of families participated in a parenting program or sought assistance for their child 2 ̆ 7 s behaviour. So what? These findings support the notion that parenting programs should be universally available to help reduce the prevalence of child behaviour problems and assist all families with the task of raising children...|$|E

We examined the prevalence of <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> in youth with motor disabilities using the Developmental Behaviour Checklist (DBC), a questionnaire developed for children with an intellectual disability. Further we investigated the associations with maladaptive personality traits and marital stress and conflict. Participants were parents and daily caretakers of 101 Flemish children and adolescents with motor disabilities (Mean age = 14 years 6 months).

40|$|Stress in dogs can {{contribute}} to behavioural problems which may lead to rehoming or euthanasia of the dog. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate how dog characteristics correlated to stress, whether it is possible to detect behavioural problems in order to treat the dogs. Twenty-two dogs were evaluated according to their <b>behavioural</b> <b>problem</b> by a veterinarian and a dog trainer. The dogs participated in a behavioural and physiological test, and the results were compared to characteristics gathered by a Canine Behavioural Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ), filled in by the dogs’ owners. The result showed that the total amount of stress related behaviour correlated positively to the C-BARQ score for attachment and attention-seeking behaviour and had a tendency of positive correlation to energy level and owner-directed aggression. Both the veterinarian <b>behavioural</b> <b>problem</b> score and trainer <b>behavioural</b> <b>problem</b> score had a tendency of positive correlation to stranger-directed fear.

40|$|Objective: Analysis of <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> {{in young}} {{children}} with language problems. Materials and methods: From 38 children diagnosed with a language problem, {{the opinion of the}} parents about the behaviour of their child, scored by the Child Behaviour Checklist 1. 5 - 5 was compared with the <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> in the Dutch population with the Chi-square test. T-tests and Mc Nemar tests were used to compare the opinion of the fathers about the <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> with the opinion of the mothers and to compare the scores on internalizing problems with scores on externalizing problems. Plots display the measurement of the mean <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> of the parents against the discrepancy between the parents and of the total <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> against the discrepancy between internalizing and externalizing problems. The relation between the <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems,</b> the language score and the non-verbal intelligence score was also compared and is presented in a bar chart. Results: All children had an inadequate language production (GDS). Twenty-seven children had an adequate and 11 children had an inadequate Language Comprehension Quotient (LCQ). Twenty-eight children had an adequate and 10 children had an inadequate non-verbal IQ (SON-IQ). In the clinical population mothers report more internalizing <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> than in Dutch peers. The fathers also experience differences, but these are not significant. There is agreement between the parents in how they experience problems on the internalizing, externalizing and total problem scale. And there are {{no significant differences between the}} internalizing and externalizing problem scales, between boys and girls, and in <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> in children with both adequate LCQ and SON-IQ and with inadequate LCQ and/or SON-IQ. Conclusion: Compared to their peers in the Dutch population, young children with language problems show more internalizing problems according to their mothers. The fathers also experience differences, but these are not significant. Fathers and mothers agree on the behaviour analysis of their child and there are no differences between the occurrences of internalizing or externalizing problems and between boys and girls. There is also no relation between the <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> and the severity of the language problem or the level of non-verbal functioning. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Most recent Canadian {{studies on}} the mental health and <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> of Canadian {{immigrant}} children {{have focused on the}} impact of various socioeconomic and demographic factors. To better understand the emotional and <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> of immigrant children, it is important to look beyond the children's family demographics and to assess the broader social context. The current study explored the effects of immigrant children's social relationships within families and peer groups, as well as the effects of their demographic backgrounds, on the children's <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems.</b> This paper is based on the data for 182 Chinese immigrant children aged 11 to 13 years old collected from the New Canadian Children and Youth Study (NCCYS) 1 st Wave in Montreal. Measures of the social relationships and <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> include the following three tools: children's perceptions of their emotional and <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> scales (five subscales); children's perception of parental relationships (parental nurturance, parental rejection, and relationships with parents); peer relationships (social competence, involvement with peers in trouble, and participating in bullying). The regression results indicated that immigrant children's relationships with both parents and peers were the most significant predictor of specific behaviour problems. Demographic factors, especially family structure, gender, and ethnicity, were also found to influence <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems</b> of Chinese immigrant children. In order to improve the integration and adaptation process for immigrant children and their families with adjustment difficulties in their social relationships and <b>behavioural</b> <b>problems,</b> relevant intervention and prevention programs (including early identification of children at risk, developing pro-social skills, improving parent-child interaction skills) need to be developed in school settings in collaboration with the community, by government, and by ethno-specific community groups...|$|R
