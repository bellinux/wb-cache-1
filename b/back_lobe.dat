5000|$|The {{radiation}} pattern of most antennas shows {{a pattern of}} [...] "lobes" [...] at various angles, directions where the radiated signal strength reaches a maximum, separated by [...] "nulls", angles at which the radiated signal strength falls to zero. In a directional antenna in which {{the objective is to}} emit the radio waves in one direction, the lobe in that direction has a larger field strength than the others; this is the [...] "main lobe". The other lobes are called [...] "side lobes", and usually represent unwanted radiation in undesired directions. The side lobe in the opposite direction (180°) from the main lobe is called the <b>back</b> <b>lobe.</b> In transmitting antennas, excessive side lobe radiation wastes energy and may cause interference to other equipment.

50|$|Like all Agnostida, Acmarhachis is {{diminutive}} and the headshield (or cephalon) and tailshield (or pygidium) are {{of approximately}} the same size (or isopygous) and outline. As in all Agnostina, Acmarhachis has two thorax segments. When Agnostina are enroled, a tiny opening between the cephalon and the thorax becomes visible (the cephalothoracic aperture) that uniquely distinguishes this group from the Eodiscina. A feature shared with all Agnostoidea is that the frontal lobe of the central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is not laterally expanded compared to the backward lobe, like in the Condylopygoidea. In Acmarhachis the furrow at midline between {{the front of the}} glabella and the border is weak or absent. The glabella has a long ogival to subquadrate front lobe, and the furrow defining it at its back is straight. The <b>back</b> <b>lobe</b> of the glabella is accompanied by two triangular basal lobes of moderate to large size. On the pygidium the axis or rhachis reaches the border. It is divided along its length in three lobes. It is shaped a bit like an amphora, the back pointed and strongly constricted across the middle lobe. The middle lobe also carries a node where it contacts the posterior lobe.|$|E
50|$|The {{transmitter}} site {{was located in}} the middle of a small dairy farm near the corner of Wellington and Stud Roads, Rowville. At the time of construction, the transmitter had no access to 3-phase power due to the lack of power transmission lines. For the first months of operation, the transmitter was powered by two 188kVA diesel generators, one of which was installed as the transmitter's backup power generator and the other which was hired for the duration. During this time, the transmitter needed to be manned on a 24hr basis to ensure the generators were fueled and remained in service, and to ensure that the power supply to the transmitter was efficiently cut-over from one generator to the other in case of generator maintenance or failure. During this time, there was an issue with the directional array, it was functioning abnormally with the main lobe and <b>back</b> <b>lobe</b> shifting in a random fashion. After considerable technical analysis, and having not found any technical reason for the shifting lobes, a rigger was sent up the two masts to re-tighten the bolts of the antenna sections. The transmitter was shut down to allow the rigger to traverse the mast's insulator and climb onto the antenna proper, then the transmitter was turned on and while the rigger was tightening the bolts on the mast sections, the transmitter power and lobe direction were monitored. Suddenly there was a scream from the direction of the mast and, fearing the worst, the transmitter was immediately shut down. Happily, the rigger was uninjured, other than for a slightly burned hand. He had found the section with loose bolts by gripping onto it with his hand, thus forming a circuit and burning his hand. With the transmitter still turned off, the loose bolts were tightened and the transmitter performed as designed thereafter.|$|E

Reflector cross polarization is calculated using double numerical integration. Reflector <b>back</b> <b>lobes</b> are estimated from radiation pattern envelopes of commercial common carrier dish antennas. The curves allow a range of f/D to be determined for a specified edge taper and blockage diameter ratio, and with a table of Cassegrain parameters, a range of possible designs that meet the 90 % beam efficiency is obtained.

Spiral antennas belong to the class of frequency independent antennas which operate over a wide range of frequencies. Polarization, radiation pattern and impedance of such antennas remain unchanged over large bandwidth. Such antennas are inherently circularly polarized with low gain. Array of spiral antennas can be used to increase the gain. Spiral antennas are reduced size antennas with its windings making it an extremely small structure. Lossy cavities are usually placed at the back to eliminate <b>back</b> <b>lobes</b> because a unidirectional pattern is usually preferred in such antennas.

40|$|Novel circularly {{polarized}} (CP) antenna configurations derived from Moxon type antenna (bent dipole element over a ground plane) for broadband VHF SATCOM applications. A sequence of topologies starting {{from a single}} vertical element to two vertical elements of the Moxon arms, then widened strip arm elements were studied. Further, arms were widened to bow tie structures with bents at 900. for achieving broadband operation. Bow tie elements were further split and optimized at a certain angle to achieve wider bandwidth. The logic in this evolution was to obtain highest possible gain based on Fano-Chu limits, which suggests that higher gain can be achieved in an electrically small antenna with maximized metallization in the structure that fill the volume. Circular polarization is obtained by two Moxon based cross elements that are fed through a hybrid 900 quadrature coupler. For the antennas that are prototyped, return loss S 11 measurements were performed, and gains are simulated using HFSS. For the band of 225 - 400 MHz, antenna gain varies between 8 - 12 dB, and S 11 is measured to be below 10 dB.

40|$|Abstract—A {{portable}} ultra {{wide band}} radio direction finder has been constructed {{based on the}} principle of stereophonic direction recognition of sound by human ears. The instrument consists of two log periodic antennas having identical electrical properties. They are positioned in a plane, preferably parallel to the ground. The directivities of the antennas are aligned at slightly different directions with respect to each other. Their output powers are compared at the source frequency for the respective polarizations. The <b>back</b> <b>lobes</b> of the antennas have been reduced by symmetrically positioning two metallic plates (reflectors) behind the antennas. The antennas, reflectors and a compass are mounted over a video camera stand such that they could be manually positioned in the azimuth. Since the antennas are of identical make, ideally the radiation pattern of either antenna-reflector combination should behave as a flipped image of the other set. For any particular polarization and frequency, the outputs from the antennas are compared with each other. The antenna assembly is rotated between 0 and 360 ◦ in the azimuth until the power difference gets minimized.

40|$|Abstract—Capacity is one {{fundamental}} problem in wireless Ad hoc networks. Deploying directional antennas to wireless net-works can reduce interference among concurrent transmissions and increase spatial reuse, while {{the technology of}} multi-channel can separate concurrent transmissions. Therefore, combining these two technologies into one wireless network is capable of great improvement on the network capacity. Recent studies proposed a multi-channel network architecture that equips each wireless node with multiple directional antennas, which is called MC-MDA network. The capacity in MC-MDA network is derived under arbitrary and random placements. However, they only used a simplified directional antenna model. For approaching the more accurate capacity in real scenario, in this paper, we consider a hybrid antenna model, which takes the effect of side lobe and <b>back</b> <b>lobe</b> into account. We derive the capacity upper-bounds of MC-MDA networks in arbitrary and random network with the hybrid model to find the effect of <b>back</b> <b>lobe</b> and side lobe. We show that the network capacity {{is closely related to}} s the ratio of the radiuses of side lobe to main lobe. The capacity decreases when s increases. Moreover, we compare the network capacity of MC-MDA using the simplified antenna model with our results. When considering the factor of interference constraint, the capacity gain using the hybrid antenna model is√ θ 2 θ 2 +(4 π 2 −θ 2) s over the one with the simplified model.
