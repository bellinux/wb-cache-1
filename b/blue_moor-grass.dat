Calcareous grassland is species rich, typified by <b>blue</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> wild-mountain thyme, lady's bedstraw, fairy flax and lady's-mantle as well as fescue grasses, sweet vernal grass, bent grass, crested dog's-tail grass, carnation sedge Cyperaceae and devil's-bit scabious on the thin layer of soil which covers the limestone rock. Within this type of habitat, limestone pavement can also often be found, which can promote an even greater diversity of species.|$|E
50|$|Sesleria caerulea, {{known as}} <b>blue</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> is {{a species of}} {{perennial}} grass in the Poaceae family, native to Europe.|$|E
50|$|The hill {{slopes and}} former quarry support an {{extensive}} area of primary magnesian limestone grassland. <b>Blue</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> Sesleria albicans, a characteristic plant of such grassland, is present but not {{abundant in the}} primary grassland on the hill slopes, where herbs such as rock-rose, Helianthemum nummularium, are more common; <b>blue</b> <b>moor-grass</b> is more plentiful in the secondary grassland on the quarry floor and spoil heaps, where it is associated with species such as quaking grass, Briza media, salad burnet, Sanguisorba minor, and autumn gentian, Gentianella amarella.|$|E
50|$|The {{remaining}} two communities (CG8 and CG9) are characterised {{by the presence}} of <b>Blue</b> <b>Moor-grass</b> (Sesleria caerulea), both of which are localised in northern England and do not fall neatly into either of the two groups described above.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} an {{important}} expanse of primary magnesian limestone grassland, in which the dominant <b>blue</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> Sesleria albicans, is associated with species such as quaking grass, Briza media, glaucous sedge, Carex flacca, and meadow oat-grass, Avenula pratensis.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} one of the most {{important}} expanses of primary magnesian limestone grassland in Great Britain. In particular, it has the largest area of the grassland type which is characterised by <b>blue</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> Sesleria albicans, and small scabious, Scabiosa columbaria.|$|E
50|$|The site's {{importance}} lies {{mainly in}} its areas of open water and fen vegetation, which are scarce habitats in lowland County Durham. There {{is also a}} small area of equally scarce magnesian limestone grassland, in which <b>blue</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> Sesleria albicans, and glaucous sedge, Carex flacca, are dominant.|$|E
50|$|In the {{undisturbed}} part of Raisby Hill primary magnesian limestone grassland is {{the main}} vegetation type. <b>Blue</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> Sesleria albicans, is abundant, {{and there is a}} rich assemblage of species characteristic of calcareous soils, such as quaking grass, Briza media, meadow oat grass, Avenula pratensis, glaucous sedge, Carex flacca, and fragrant orchid, Gymnadenia conopsea.|$|E
50|$|The site's {{interest}} lies {{in an area}} of unimproved magnesian limestone grassland, {{in which}} <b>blue</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> Sesleria albicans, and small scabious, Scabiosa columbaria, are the dominant species. This is a scarce vegetation type, which is found only in County Durham and the extent of which has been severely reduced by quarrying and intensive agriculture.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} univoltine. Adults fly from June to August. The eggs are laid singly on {{the leaves of}} grass. The larvae hatch after two weeks. The hibernating larva is {{reported}} to feed on Agrostis, Dactylis, Poa annua, Bromus erectus and other grasses. In Scotland the main host plants are purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) and <b>blue</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Sesleria caerulea).|$|E
50|$|The site {{supports}} {{an area of}} semi-natural magnesian limestone grassland, {{in which}} <b>blue</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> Sesleria albicans, is the dominant species. Glaucous sedge, Carex flacca, quaking grass, Briza media, meadow oat-grass, Avenula pratensis, rock-rose, Helianthemum nummularium, and fragrant orchid, Gymnadenia conopsea, are common, while sea plantain, Plantago maritima, is locally abundant in the grassland {{at the edge of}} limestone spoil heaps.|$|E
50|$|The {{steep hill}} slopes support an {{extensive}} area of primary magnesian limestone grassland in which <b>blue</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> Sesleria albicans, is abundant. The rich assemblage of grassland species includes {{a number of}} rare and local species, bird's-eye primrose, Primula farinosa, adder's-tongue fern, Ophioglossum vulgatum, lesser club-moss, Selaginella selaginoides, and grass of Parnassus, Parnassia palustris, {{as well as an}} inland colony of sea plantain, Plantago maritima.|$|E
50|$|The {{western part}} of the site has been {{disturbed}} by quarrying and the vegetation here consists of primary turf that was translocated between 1982 and 1990. Although it remains rich in herbs, the characteristic features of magnesian limestone grassland were lost during the translocation: <b>blue</b> <b>moor-grass</b> is uncommon, while coltsfoot, Tussilago farfara, and field sow-thistle, Sonchus arvensis, which entered the grassland during translocation, persist.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{inaccessible}} cliffs {{are home}} to ledge dwelling flora including mosses and liverworts, such as red leskea, sharp rock-bristle and the very rare Zygodon gracilis. The ledges also support woodrush, polypody and water avens, purple saxifrage, yellow saxifrage, hoary whitlowgrass and roseroot. <b>Blue</b> <b>moor-grass</b> can also be found, with sheep's-fescue and herbs such as thyme, salad burnet and common rock-rose. There is wild thyme, common milkwort, fairy flax, bird's-foot trefoil, autumn gentian, harebell, eyebright.|$|E
50|$|The site {{consists}} of a small area of species-rich magnesian limestone grassland, a vegetation type that is rare nationally and mainly restricted to County Durham and Tyne and Wear. There are two distinct plant communities, the larger of which, dominated by <b>blue</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> Sesleria albicans, and small scabious, Scabiosa columbaria, is known only from east Durham. The other community, dominated by upright brome, Bromus erectus, is common on limestone in southern England but is at its northern limit in Durham, {{where there are no}} other protected sites.|$|E
50|$|The area is {{important}} for its magnesian limestone grassland communities, which are largely confined to County Durham and increasingly scarce even there. The grasslands at Quarrington Hill are typical of the type, being characterised {{by the presence of}} <b>blue</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> Sesleria albicans, and small scabious, Scabiosa columbaria. Less common species include common milkwort, Polygala vulgaris, hairy violet, Viola hirta, and wild carrot, Daucus carota. The nationally scarce dark-red helleborine, Epipactis atrorubens, is found at the site, as is basil thyme, Clinopodium acinos, a southern species that is uncommon this far north.|$|E

50|$|The site {{occupies}} {{part of a}} disused quarry, {{in which}} have developed areas of primary and secondary magnesian limestone grassland.

The grasslands at Tuthill Quarry are typical of the type, being characterised {{by the presence of}} <b>blue</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> Sesleria albicans, and small scabious, Scabiosa columbaria, but a number of less common species are also present, including common butterwort, Pinguicula vulgaris, and adder's-tongue fern, Ophioglossum vulgatum. There is a small patch of the nationally scarce bird's-eye primrose, Primula farinosa, {{and one of the few}} records from lowland Durham of lesser clubmoss, Selaginella selaginoides, is from this site.|$|E

Steep south facing slopes above the reclaimed railway line support a more open, herbrich grassland characterised by common quaking-grass Briza media, blue moorgrass, crested hair-grass and red fescue with yarrow Achillea millefolium, hairy violet Viola hirta, hoary ragwort Senecio erucifolius, and fragrant orchid Gymnadenia conopsea.

Ref Placenames NI Monawilkin is the best example of unimproved calcareous grassland (<b>blue</b> <b>moor-grass)</b> in Northern Ireland. This differs from other Sesleria-dominated grasslands in the UK in that it also includes species such as Euphrasia salisburgensis, eyebright. Monawilikin is also an important Orchid site, contains the best inland site for moths and butterflies (23 species recorded) in Northern Ireland and is the only Northern Irish site for Cupido minimus, the small blue butterfly.Consequently, this area was designated as a special area of conservation (SAC) and area of special scientific interest(ASSI). The Monawilkin SAC land cover comprises 3% water bodies, 5% Bogs/Marshes/fringe water vegetation, 13% Heath, Scrub, 50% dry grassland, 14% humid grassland and 15% broad leaved woodland.|$|E
