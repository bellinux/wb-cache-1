Young children, in particular, are naturally curious and may intentionally put shiny objects, such as coins or button batteries, into their mouths.

For example, a coin causes local pressure on the tissue but generally, is not a medical emergency to remove.

In 2009, Avolio Luigi and Martucciello Giuseppe showed that although ingested nonmagnetic foreign bodies are likely to be passed spontaneously without consequence, ingested magnets (magnetic toys) may attract each other through children's intestinal walls and cause severe damage, such as pressure necrosis, perforation, intestinal fistulas, volvulus, and obstruction.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{mechanism}} of injury with <b>button</b> <b>battery</b> ingestions is the generation of hydroxide ions, which cause severe chemical burns, at the anode. This is an electrochemical effect of the intact battery, and {{does not require the}} casing to be breached or the contents released. Complications include oesophageal strictures, Tracheo-oesophageal fistulas, vocal cord paralysis, aorto-oesophageal fistulas, and death. The majority of ingestions are not witnessed; presentations are non-specific; battery voltage has increased; the 20 to 25 mm <b>button</b> <b>battery</b> size are more likely to become lodged at the cricopharyngeal junction; and severe tissue damage can occur within 2 hours. The 3 V, 20 mm CR2032 lithium battery has been implicated in many of the complications from <b>button</b> <b>battery</b> ingestions by children of less than 4 years of age.Button batteries can also cause significant necrotic injury when stuck in the nose or ears.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Button</b> <b>batteries</b> {{represent}} a low percentage of all foreign bodies swallowed by children and esophageal location {{is even less}} frequent. However, these cases {{are more likely to}} develop severe injuries. The aim of this essay is to report three cases treated in our institution and review previous reports. Material and Methods: Chart review and literature search. Case Reports: We treated three children between 2 - 7 - years old with <b>button</b> <b>batteries</b> lodged at esophagus. They all presented esophageal burns (EB), which evolved in esophageal stenosis in two out of the three cases. Results: We found 29 more cases in literature and the injuries included EB, esophageal perforation (EP) and tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). Discussion: Swallowed <b>button</b> <b>batteries</b> rarely remain in esophagus, but these cases present a higher risk of tisular damage. Injuries can take place even after few hours; and therefore, endoscopy must be performed as soon as possible. Further study on button batteries′ safety and the establishment of a maximum size for them would be good preventive measures...|$|R

40|$|Background: Button {{batteries}} {{represent a}} distinct type of foreign body. Serious complica-tions can be resulted, {{particularly when the}} battery is impacted in the esopha-gus. The potentially detrimental effects of <b>button</b> <b>battery</b> ingestion have often been overlooked in Taiwan. We surveyed patients following <b>button</b> <b>battery</b> ingestion to define the characteristics and outcomes of this popula-tion. Methods: The records of 25 patients with <b>button</b> <b>battery</b> ingestion that had been report-ed to the Taipei Veterans General Hospital Poison Control Center from July 1988 through January 1998 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: <b>Button</b> <b>battery</b> ingestion occurred most commonly in male children (N= 20; 80 %) and children under 3 years of age (N= 19; 76 %). Most children were asymptomatic (N= 22; 88 %). Two children suffered abdominal pain, and one suffered dyspnea and stridor. Reported complications included black stools (N= 3) and tracheoesophageal fistula formation (N= 1). Two children under-went endoscopic battery removal, and batteries passed the entire gastroin-testinal tract in all other subjects. The interval between battery ingestion and passage when documented (N= 16) was never more than 5 days. Conclusion: Most ingested batteries passed through the gastrointestinal tract without any adverse effects. An initial roentgenogram should be obtained promptly to determine battery location and diameter, and the battery's chemical composi-tion should be determined when possible. Esophageal impaction of the bat-teries requires emergency endoscopic or surgical removal.

40|$|Introduction. <b>Button</b> <b>battery</b> {{ingestion}} {{is considered}} an emergency situation in pediatric patients {{that needs to be}} managed promptly; otherwise, it may lead to serious and potentially lethal complications, especially when it is impacted in the esophagus.

He did not have any symptoms and no pathological findings were encountered during clinical examination. X-ray investigation revealed the presence of the battery in the stomach.
