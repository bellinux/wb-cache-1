5|$|With {{some people}} unable {{to believe that}} the Japanese would be so ruthless, rumours <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> almost {{immediately}} after news of the attack was made public. The most common rumour was that Centaur had been carrying munitions or commandos {{at the time of her}} sinking, with the Japanese made aware of this prior to her departure. This stemmed from an incident involving the ambulance drivers' weapons during loading in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Charles Coulson {{the accumulation}} of wealth and resources, such as food, led {{to the need for}} defensive structures. The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. Northern Europe was slower than the East to develop defensive structures and {{it was not until the}} Bronze Age that hill forts developed and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> across Europe. In the medieval period castles were influenced by earlier forms of elite architecture, contributing to regional variations. Importantly, while castles had military aspects, they contained a recognisable household structure within their walls, reflecting the multi-functional use of these buildings.|$|E
50|$|The strike escalates, with {{management}} refusing to concede {{any of the}} demands, doing under the table deals with union officials to bring in strikebreakers. Meanwhile, the strike <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>to</b> other local workplaces, becoming a symbol of class struggle, {{as well as a}} struggle for better short-term conditions. The workers become increasingly militant, turning to violent tactics and eventually firebombing the original building site. The strike <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>to</b> other areas of the country without any official union involvement. Panicked, the UK government deals with strikers with increasing violence and repression, demonstrations turn into riots, and the Captain is arrested on false charges of conspiracy.|$|R

5|$|Discontent <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> {{among the}} people, which {{sometimes}} escalated to violence.

Carabane has remained one of the calmest areas of Casamance throughout the conflict. Nonetheless, a few small incidents were reported around April 2000. The rebels may have wanted to take advantage of Carabane's reputation to attract media attention.|$|E

Scouting <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> throughout Great Britain and Ireland, then through {{the countries of the}} British Empire, and soon {{to the rest of the}} world. A reunion of the original campers was held in 1928 at the Chief Scout's home at Pax Hill in Hampshire.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, Philippine ports {{opened to}} world trade and shifts started {{occurring}} within Filipino society.

The ideals of revolution also <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> through the islands. Criollo dissatisfaction resulted in the 1872 Cavite Mutiny that was a precursor to the Philippine Revolution.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} quarter of the 18th century, more {{information}} about cricket became available as the growing newspaper industry took an interest.

By 1725, significant patrons such as Edwin Stead, Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond and Sir William Gage were forming teams of county strength in Kent and Sussex. The earliest known great players, including William Bedle and Thomas Waymark, were active. Cricket was attracting large, vociferous crowds and the matches were social occasions at which gambling and alcoholic drinks were additional attractions.|$|E

The Hän did not appear to know about the extent of the gold deposits in the region.|$|E
5|$|Rite of Memphis-Misraïm Proceeding from Cagliostro's rite, the Rite of Misraïm (from Arabic مصر Miṣr = Egypt) {{continued}} {{as a form}} of mixed, esoteric masonry.

During the 1880s the two rites were fused by Giuseppe Garibaldi into the Rite of Memphis-Misraïm. The modern order now boasts up to 99 degrees, not all of which actually worked.|$|E
5|$|Rulers {{sponsored}} Theravada {{and often}} {{took steps to}} stop the spreading of Mahayana beliefs. Rulers such as Aggabodhi I, Kashyapa V (914–923) and Mahinda IV (956–972) promulgated disciplinary rules for the proper conduct of the Sangha. Voharika Tissa and Gothabhaya (249–262) expelled several monks from the order for supporting such views. A change in this occurred when Mahasena embraced Mahayana teachings and acted against Theravada institutions. However, he too accommodated Theravada teachings after the population rebelled against him. As the kingdom and the authority or kings declined, Mahayana and Tantric doctrines again <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>spread,</b> however, Theravada remained the main and most widespread doctrine.|$|E
