Just a direct {{connection}} <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> the contact patch. The responses to steering, throttle, brake, and gearshift inputs are so nearly instantaneous that they verge on the telepathic. And I can see exactly what's happening, {{at least at the}} front end of the car, as the wheels turn and judder.|$|E
25|$|The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{is adapted}} from the Inclusion of Others in the Self (IOS) Scale by Aron et al. (1992). The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{contains}} seven pairs of Venn diagrams that range in how far apart the circles are. In the first pair, there is no overlap but as {{you get to the}} second, or third pair, the circles begin to overlap more and more. In the last pair (the seventh pair) the circles completely overlap. Participants respond to eight items by choosing the pair of circles that best denotes their connection with that particular item. A sample item is “The connection <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> a wild animal (such as a squirrel, deer, or wolf).” There are also eight other items to this scale that assess how connected participants feel to people. This scale shows acceptable reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.75) and validity (correlations with concern for environment). This scale is not contaminated with social desirability biases. The NR scale, the Allo-Inclusive scale, and the CN scale are highly correlated with one another suggesting they {{are all part of the}} nature connectedness construct.|$|E

500|$|Dark Forces {{gameplay}} {{has been}} described as [...] "challenging" [...] and has generally received praise. Ron Dulin, reviewing the game for GameSpot, highlights the implementation of puzzles within levels: [...] "The levels are diverse and ingenious, with plenty of creative obstacles standing <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> your goal. While they can be occasionally frustrating, Dark Forces diverse gameplay requirements make this title more mentally challenging than your average key hunt." [...] The graphics and sound were both praised as helping to immerse the player in the environment.|$|E

Before dying, Goriot rages about their disrespect toward him. His funeral is {{attended}} only by Rastignac, a servant named Christophe, and two paid mourners. Goriot's daughters, rather than being present at the funeral, send their empty coaches, each bearing their families' respective coat of arms. After the short ceremony, Rastignac turns to face Paris as the lights of evening begin to appear.

500|$|The Knox and Kane Railroad (KKRR) {{operated}} sightseeing trips from Kane {{through the}} Allegheny National Forest {{and over the}} Kinzua Bridge from 1987 until the bridge was closed in 2002.

The New York Times described being on the bridge as [...] "more akin to ballooning than railroading" [...] and noted [...] "You stare straight out with nothing <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> an immense sea of verdure a hundred yards [...] below."

The proposal was for a stadium with a capacity of 60,000 which would retain a competition athletics track. The proposal was welcomed by the chairman of UK athletics, Ed Warner, who said, [...] "I think it will feel great as a football stadium and I speak as a football fan as well the chairman of UK Athletics.

500|$|Following the video's premiere on MTV, Gaga {{explained}} {{some of the}} its {{scenes and}} her inspiration: [...] "The video is quite complex {{in the way that}} the story is told, and it's meant to be slightly linear and slightly twisted and confusing, which is the way that love is." [...] Regarding the sexual intercourse scenes between actor Taylor Kinney and the singer as a mermaid, Gaga explained that it emphasized metaphorically that sometimes relationships did not work. [...] "No matter what you do, there's this giant boundary <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> someone else. So that's what it's about, perceiving in your imagination that there's something magical inside of you that you can make it work," [...] she said. After revealing that the wedding dress shown in the video belonged to her mother, Gaga explained the scenes involving the ice cream truck.

500|$|In 2008, Lane {{reunited with}} Richard Gere for the romantic drama Nights in Rodanthe.

She then {{appeared}} in Killshot with Mickey Rourke, which was given a limited theatrical release before being released on DVD in 2009. While promoting Nights in Rodanthe, she expressed frustration with being typecast and stated that she was [...] "gunning for something that's not so sympathetic. I need to be a bitch, and I need to be in a comedy. I've decided. No more Miss Nice Guy." [...] Lane had even contemplated quitting acting and spending more time with her family if she is unable to get these kinds of roles. She said in an interview, [...] "I can't do anything official. My agents won't let me. <b>Between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me, I don't have anything else coming out." [...] Despite her concerns with being typecast, Lane signed on to Secretariat (2010), a Disney film about the relationship between the 1973 Triple Crown-winning racehorse and his owner, Penny Chenery, whom Lane portrayed.|$|E
500|$|Mahone is {{depicted}} as an intelligent FBI agent with [...] "an amazingly sharp mind", quickly discovering the secret of Michael's tattoos and his plans. His thoroughness and investigational skills allow him to extrapolate the fugitives' location, causing Michael to remark, [...] "It's like he knows where we're going, what we're thinking." [...] Mahone {{has been described as}} [...] "intellectually matched with Scofield", mainly in his ability to analyze and interpret his surroundings. Craig Blanchard of The San Diego Union-Tribune describes Michael as the [...] "brains of the operation" [...] and Mahone as his [...] "arch-nemesis, sort of his equal {{on the other side of}} the law." [...] Michael and Mahone have been described as [...] "two sides of the same brilliant coin"; however, Mahone notes, [...] "there's one big difference <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I (sic), Michael. And you just proved it. You can't kill. And that's what it's gonna take to stop me. Because I don't have the same reservations. I can." [...] His willingness to commit murder in order to preserve his life is shown when Michael asks if he would kill two innocent men to [...] "get his life back", to which he replies [...] "Absolutely." [...] Fichtner defends Mahone by saying that he [...] "doesn't do everything he does because he wants to do it. He's not OK about it. It's going to start to come out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Grant had {{delivered}} {{the first significant}} Union victory of the war. Halleck obtained a promotion for him to major general of volunteers, along with some other generals in his department, and used the victory {{as an opportunity to}} request overall command in the Western Theater, which he currently shared with Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, but which was not granted. He briefly relieved Grant of field command of a newly ordered expedition up the Tennessee River after Grant met Buell in Nashville, citing rumors of renewed alcoholism, but soon restored Grant to field command (pressure by Lincoln and the War Department may have been a factor in this about-face). Explaining the reinstatement to Grant, Halleck portrayed it as his effort to correct an injustice, not revealing to Grant that the injustice had originated with him. When Grant wrote to Halleck suggesting [...] "I must have enemies <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> myself," [...] Halleck replied, [...] "You are mistaken. There is no enemy <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{right to}} choice is {{probably}} an individual right only, {{as opposed to}} also being a family right or a union right, however the rights are <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> the government and not <b>between</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> a member of your family. [...] In the 1995 Supreme Court case B. (R.) v. Children’s Aid Society, in which two parents attempted to block a certain treatment for their child on religious grounds, it was argued that the personal choice aspect of liberty guaranteed family privacy. [...] This argument drew from United States case law, but the Supreme Court of Canada pointed out section 7 of the Charter contains individual rights, and hence there cannot be family rights. [...] Still, mindful that there was still choices involved in the family situation, the Supreme Court split on whether liberty rights were infringed. [...] Likewise, in I.L.W.U. v. The Queen (1992), the Supreme Court stressed the individual nature of section 7 to deny unions {{had a right to}} strike as part of the members' liberty. [...] The Court also stressed that strikes were socioeconomic matters that did not involve the justice system, and section 7 was concentrated on the justice system.|$|E
