40|$|Regenerative <b>Braking</b> <b>Systems</b> (RBS) {{provide an}} {{efficient}} method to assist hybrid electric buses achieve better fuel economy while lowering exhaust emissions. This paper describes {{the design and}} testing of three regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>systems,</b> {{one of which is}} a series regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> and two of which are parallel regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>systems.</b> The existing friction based Adjustable <b>Braking</b> <b>System</b> (ABS) on the bus is integrated with each of the new <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> in order to ensure bus safety and stability. The design of the RBS is facilitated by Simulink [1] which is used to build an interactive, multi-domain simulator that is allows parametric variation of vehicle speed, State of Charge (SOC) for the batteries, and the maximum current to be allowed to the batteries from the RBS. The required braking forces as a function of wheel speed are modeled using dSpace[2]. A Hardwire-in-the-Loop (HIL) experimental setup is used for component testing, followed by road testing using the Chinese Urban Bus Driving Cycle. Results indicate that all three <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> provide some energy recovery, with the serial RBS providing the best combination of energy recovery with acceptable drivability, safety and stability. Overall results confirm that regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> can recover significant braking energy while operating in a safe and predictable manner...|$|R

25|$|With all the {{locomotives}} shut down, the {{air compressor}} no longer supplied {{air to the}} air <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> As air leaked from the <b>brake</b> <b>system,</b> the main air reservoirs were slowly depleted, gradually reducing {{the effectiveness of the}} locomotive air brakes. At 00:56, the air pressure had dropped to a point at which the combination of locomotive air brakes and hand brakes could no longer hold the train, and it began to roll downhill toward Lac-Mégantic, just over seven miles away. A witness recalled watching the train moving slowly toward Lac-Mégantic without the locomotive lights on. The track was not equipped with signals to alert the rail traffic controller to the presence of a runaway train.|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{accidents}} in four wheeled vehicles occur because of failure of <b>braking</b> <b>systems.</b> Manual method of applying brakes is always dangerous as {{it leads to}} accidents.

This system aims to prevent the wheels locking. Because based on the research, which has locking wheels during braking will cause the risk of accidents is greater. Locking wheel will cause the car skidded, especially on wet roads or on snowy roads. Therefore Antilock <b>Braking</b> <b>System</b> is an important safety system on the car, it would be dangerous if the <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> is damaged. Antilock <b>Braking</b> <b>System</b> have their own security system to detect any damage to the system. But this system only detects electrical damage to the Antilock <b>Braking</b> <b>System,</b> whereas mechanical damage to the ABS system can not be detected. Mechanical damage which may be found on the ABS system, among others: loss of pump efficiency, fluid leaks, the air blister in the oil, and loss of brake efficiency. In this final task will be given a simulation of the fourth mechanical damage. This simulation aims to find out whether the above four damage affects slip rate, vehicle speed, wheel speed, and distance to stop the vehicle after the brakes with Antilock <b>Braking</b> <b>System</b> damaged.

40|$|Due to {{the space}} {{limitation}} at the driving tyre, some of the small electric vehicles (EVs) with two in-wheel motors employed a mechanical <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> rather than the hydraulic <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> Although the mechanical <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> is compact, its rigidness and the response performance are lower than the hydraulic <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> In this paper, we propose a combination of anti-lock <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> (ABS) and regenerative brake control to improve the braking performance of the small EVs. The hydraulic unit of ABS is installed at the front tyre, while an in-wheel motor at the rear tyre will be an actuator of ABS to control the regenerative braking torque at the rear tyre. During braking on an icy road, the operational of ABS and regenerative brake control can prevent the tyre lock and vehicle from skidding. The simulation result shows that our proposed model can improve the safety and stability of the vehicle...|$|R
