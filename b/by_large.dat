50|$|Collective {{violence}} is subdivided into structural violence and economic violence. Unlike {{the other two}} broad categories, the subcategories of collective violence suggest possible motives for violence committed <b>by</b> <b>larger</b> groups of individuals or by states. Collective violence that is committed to advance a particular social agenda includes, for example, crimes of hate committed by organized groups, terrorist acts and mob violence. Political violence includes war and related violent conflicts, state violence and similar acts carried out <b>by</b> <b>larger</b> groups. Economic violence includes attacks <b>by</b> <b>larger</b> groups motivated <b>by</b> economic gain - such as attacks carried out {{with the purpose of}} disrupting economic activity, denying access to essential services, or creating economic division and fragmentation. Clearly, acts committed <b>by</b> <b>larger</b> groups can have multiple motives.|$|R

5|$|Eolambia {{would have}} lived in a forested {{environment}} {{at the edge of}} lakes in a humid floodplain environment, feeding on gymnosperms, ferns, and flowering plants. The water levels in the lakes changed over time with cyclical wet and dry spells caused by the precession of the Earth, reflected by alternating bands in the sediments of the Mussentuchit Member. As a juvenile, Eolambia would have been preyed upon <b>by</b> <b>large</b> crocodylomorphs residing in the lake waters. With increasing age, however, they became impervious to the crocodylomorphs, and mature individuals (at least eight to nine years in age) were preyed on <b>by</b> <b>large</b> theropods such as the neovenatorid Siats.|$|E

5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is {{a computer}} system with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus. Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32processors. Because of {{the small size of}} the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved <b>by</b> <b>large</b> caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E
5|$|About 23 Ma, in the Pleistocene, {{continental}} ice sheets {{expanded from}} the polar {{regions of the}} globe to cover lower latitudes far north of the region, starting a series of cold glacial periods that were interrupted by warmer interglacial periods. Snowmelt from alpine glaciers on the nearby Sierra Nevada during glacial periods fed rivers that flowed into the valleys of the region year round. Since the topography of the Basin and Range region was largely formed by faulting, not by river erosion, many of the basins have no outlets, meaning they will fill up with water like a bathtub until they overflow into the next basin. So during the cooler and wetter pluvial climates of the glacial periods, much of eastern California, all of Nevada, and western Utah were covered <b>by</b> <b>large</b> lakes separated by linear islands (the present day ranges).|$|E
