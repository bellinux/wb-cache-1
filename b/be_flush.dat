25|$|The {{experience}} gained {{in designing the}} Project 17 Shivalik-class frigates will {{be applied to the}} Project 17A (P17A). The Project 17A frigates will improve upon the Project 17 (P17) in terms of stealth. They will have covered mooring deck and the number of antennae on the ship will be reduced by using a AESA radar. The P17A will also feature better roll stabilisation and a discreet visual profile. The weapon platform in the P17A ships will be compact and they will be armed with the Barak 8 (missile) surface-to-air missile developed jointly by India and Israel, and the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile. The weapon systems will <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> deck mounted allowing vertical launch of missiles from under the deck. The crew complement will be reduced from the existing 257 (including 35 officers) to about 150 by using high levels of automation, which will reduce the operational costs by around 20 per cent and result in higher operational availability of the warships. The construction times will be reduced and productivity will improved by using modular integrated construction. The ship will have a displacement of 6,670 tonnes.|$|E
500|$|After the Second World War {{began in}} August 1939, Vindictive was {{transferred}} to Devonport for a modernisation like that of her sister , with nine [...] guns, four twin-gun [...] mounts and a catapult. She had a low priority so little work had been done by early October, when a less complex modernisation was considered. This proposal had six 6-inch guns and three 4-inch AA guns, and her former aft boiler room was to be converted from a laundry into an oil tank to extend her range, but this was rejected in favour of a conversion into a fleet repair ship. Her armament was removed and her forward superstructure was extended over the former hangar's roof. Her aft superstructure was extended to <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> with her sides and slightly lengthened, and a large deckhouse {{was built on the}} quarterdeck. Her armament now consisted of six single 4-inch QF Mk V AA guns, all on the centreline, two quadruple [...] "pom-pom" [...] mounts, one on each side, and six depth charges. In this role, she had a standard displacement of [...] ( [...] at full load) and her draught increased to [...]|$|E

2500|$|Based on {{the size}} of the {{aircraft}} that the new ship was to carry, the design of the carrier was to <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> decked, meaning that the ship would have no island control structure. This was done to create more space for large winged aircraft. The flush-deck design carried with it two major areas of concern. [...] The first was concern over how smoke from the power plants would be diverted away from the flight deck. This had been a major issue with the US Navy's first aircraft carrier, , in the 1920s when carrier development was first underway. The second was the placement of early warning radar equipment to allow the ship to detect incoming attacks. One solution was for a command ship to be close by which would carry the commander of the task force and the early detection radar. The command ship would radio electronic information and orders from its command center over to the carrier. A second was for the ship to carry aircraft that could fly the early warning radar. [...] These would fly overhead and detect approaching aircraft. In truth, the ship as designed would not be able to safely operate by itself, but would need to operate in conjunction with traditional fleet carriers as a complementary bomber-carrier. In fact, the ship was being designed on the basis of the aircraft that it was thought it would carry, and these were based on projections of what aircraft would be in existence in the period 1952 to 1960.|$|E
