25|$|Di-2ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) {{has been}} {{medically}} approved {{for many years}} for use in medical devices; the PVC-DEHP combination proving to be very suitable for making <b>blood</b> <b>bags</b> because DEHP stabilises red blood cells, minimising haemolysis (red blood cell rupture). However, DEHP is coming under increasing pressure in Europe. The assessment of potential risks related to phthalates, {{and in particular the}} use of DEHP in PVC medical devices, was subject to scientific and policy review by the European Union authorities, and on 21 March 2010, a specific labeling requirement was introduced across the EU for all devices containing phthalates that are classified as CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction). The label aims to enable healthcare professionals to use this equipment safely, and, where needed, take appropriate precautionary measures for patients at risk of over-exposure.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} {{managing}} the <b>blood</b> <b>bag</b> that is received from the blood donation events needs a proper and systematic management. The <b>blood</b> <b>bag</b> must be handled with care and treated thoroughly as it is related to someone's life. The development of Web-based Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is proposed to provide a management functional to the blood bank in order to handle the <b>blood</b> <b>bag.</b> In Kuala Terengganu, East Peninsular Coast of Malaysia has only one government hospital that handles blood bank currently is using a standalone system. This web-based management system {{was developed to meet}} the requirements for Sultanah Nur Zahirah Hospital (HSNZ).

40|$|Storage and {{transportation}} of {{red blood cells}} (RBCs) outside the standard temperature range as defined by guidelines can lead to hemolysis. One of the main factors believed to cause hemolysis is temperature. Infusion of the corrupted RBCs leads to haemolytic reactions which are severe and life-threatening. We developed a temperature monitoring system to monitor temperature changes of each <b>blood</b> <b>bag</b> during storage {{and transportation}}. The main objective {{of the present study}} was evaluating the accuracy of the temperature monitoring system and studying its feasibility. Validating the system relied on accurate digital thermometers that latch on a <b>blood</b> <b>bag.</b> To evaluate the feasibility, a case study was performed on 20 RBC bags transported from hospital blood bank to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit and the heart operating room. The results indicated that 12 % of 25605 recorded temperatures (per minute) were outside the standard range. Minimum and maximum temperatures were 0. 5 °C and 16 °C that were below and above the standard, respectively. The system was shown to be easily handled by users. The system is capable to alarm when a <b>blood</b> <b>bag's</b> temperature is outside the standard temperature and prevents blood corruption. This system can be used as a decision support system in blood transfusion services to improve storage and transportation conditions of the <b>blood</b> <b>bag...</b>|$|R

500|$|Garland and VFX {{supervisor}} Jon Thum began {{developing the}} Slo-Mo concept sequences in 2009 during filming for Never Let Me Go. They experimented with an effect {{to replicate the}} visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs to see how long {{it could be used}} before it distracted the viewer from the story or action sequence. They continued to develop and modify the effect until the end of post-production, tweaking colours, colour saturation, image framing and camera motion. Slo-Mo scenes also feature a rainbow colour scheme and sparkle highlights to create an unreal and otherworldly effect. The filmmakers experimented with <b>blood</b> <b>bags,</b> prosthetics, shooting real bullets, and compressed air to see the effect of direct body hits in slow motion. In the finished film, compressed air was used to create impact ripples on flesh. Garland said the concept was inspired by nature documentaries that used high-speed photography to capture animals in slow motion. He said, [...] "You see a whale or a shark breach the water...then you'd stop thinking about the animal and you get transfixed by...how water droplets connect and touch against each other. Somehow like a real [...] trip, sort of stepping outside it but staying attached at the same time." [...] He questioned whether the technique could be used with violence to make it purely aesthetic. He said: [...] "Can it be so abstract that it becomes genuinely beautiful? ...really aesthetically beautiful even if someone is having their cheek blown out or their head crushing into concrete." [...] Comic artist Jock provided concept art for the film design.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of UHF {{electromagnetic}} fields produced by a RFID reader on a <b>blood</b> <b>bag</b> are evaluated numerically in several configurations. The results of the simulation, field level and distribution, specific absorption rate (SAR), and heating time show that an exposure to a typical reader field leads to a temperature increase smaller than 0. 1 C and to a SAR smaller than 1 W/kg. As a consequence, no adverse biological effects occur during a typical UHF RFID reading cycle on a <b>blood</b> <b>bag.</b> Therefore, the <b>blood</b> contained in a bag traced using UHF-RFID is as safe as those traced using barcodes.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} an antenna especially {{designed for a}} RFID passive tag working at UHF (867 MHz), for healthcare applications. In particular for the transfusional medicine and the blood supply chain. The tag {{has to be able}} to work placed on the top of a <b>blood</b> <b>bag,</b> while the bag is full of blood, and the antenna has been designed with this goal in mind. Therefore we require an antenna able to work close to a (relatively large amount of) lossy medium with high permittivity. Moreover, the bag shape is curved but its shape cannot be predicted exactly, so that the antenna must retain its behavior for a large set of different environments. In order to comply with all those requirements, a printed slot antenna built with a exible substrate has been selected, so that the whole tag can be exible too. The first step was the optimization of the working parameters of the antenna while placed on a perfect planar surface (i. e., assuming the <b>blood</b> <b>bag</b> to be a parallelepiped). Since the actual bag shape is not known, this choice allows to take into account the lossy material, but using a simple geometry. The antenna has been optimized to get the maximum reading distance. Then we consider the effects of a real <b>blood</b> <b>bag</b> (i. e., a curved one), filled with blood, on the antenna behavior. We consider a bag with a transverse section bounded by two arc of circles (with a radius quite larger than the bag size). Since we found a reasonable agreement with the planar antenna we can assume that the antenna behavior is quite insensitive to the bag shape. A robustness analysis, respect to the bag curvature radius, has been performed, too, to assess the antenna use in real environments...|$|R

RFID technology is a feasible solution for this kind of issues. It provides both tracking and identification methods to ensure the quality of the blood products during the storage and transportation as well as the patient safety in the transfusion. In this research, we adopted the design science and experiment testing methodologies to create four different experiments in order to evaluate the performance of RFID technology in the <b>blood</b> <b>bag</b> storage phase. Some fundamental properties of the proposed RFID system has been tested in a simulated hospital blood bank situation, including the maximum detection range of tags and the maximum readable number of tags.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, quality system {{requirements}} have been introduced for blood components. The necessary compliance with standard productions will have a considerable impact on Blood Banks. The introduction of automated methods is the most satisfactory means to meet these requirements for blood component preparation. A new device has been developed to automate the fractionation of blood into components. We evaluated the efficacy of this instrument as compared to manual methods. A total of 218 units of blood have been collected, into several different commercial <b>blood</b> <b>bag</b> systems (77 into standard quadruple bag systems, 141 into bag systems with integrated in line filters), and {{used to evaluate the}} universality of the instrument. Whole blood units were processed using the Top/Top system and the Compomat G 4 (Fresenius HemoCare). A separate program protocol was developed for each kind of bag. Use of the Compomat G 4 resulted in a statistically significant (p< 0. 001) increase of the hemoglobin in filtered red cell concentrates (RCC) in comparison with the manual procedure, and a similar trend, even not statistically significant, has been observed for filtered RCC. Regardless of bag systems, we were able to observe a statistically significant increase of platelets in the platelet concentrates (PCs), when comparing automatic versus manual procedure. The automated procedure {{has been shown to be}} fast, and easy for the operators. This device reliably produces acceptable blood components, and has been shown adaptable to use with different <b>blood</b> <b>bag</b> systems. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
