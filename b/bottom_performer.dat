40|$|In this study, {{employees}} are given autonomy in effort allocation across two tasks - complex and simple tasks, where {{the return to}} the organization is significantly higher for the complex task requiring high skill than for the simple task requiring low skill. An unavoidable feature of multi-task settings is that effort expended on one task detracts from effort that can be expended on another task. This effort trade-off among tasks becomes problematic when the returns from different tasks are unequal, with important consequences for a firm 2 ̆ 7 s overall performance. The design of management accounting control systems in such multi-task setting is difficult because organizations have to achieve multiple objectives: to improve productivity on both simple and complex tasks (i. e., performance) and to direct employee effort to more complex tasks given that the complex tasks are more valuable to firms (i. e., effort allocation). In a laboratory experiment, I {{examine the effects of}} two motivational mechanisms, financial compensation and relative performance information (RPI), on employee performance and effort allocation between simple and complex tasks. I find that the effects of RPI and financial compensation are independent such that each motivational mechanism affects performance and effort allocation separately. In addition, I find that the effects of RPI or financial compensation depend on whether a worker is a top performer or a <b>bottom</b> <b>performer.</b> Also, findings demonstrate that the effects of these motivational mechanisms on employee effort allocation and performance depend on the complexity of the task. Future research studies and managers who design incentive systems should consider the implementation of different types of incentives for different performer levels. Organizations should consider the degree of complexity of the tasks that workers must perform in multi-task settings...|$|E

40|$|Perception of {{abilities}} {{plays an}} important role in informing one’s decisions at times and often in forming one’s self perception. The Dunning-Kruger effect is a fascinating and empirically observable bias in which top performers tend to make more accurate estimations of their ability than <b>bottom</b> <b>performers.</b> The current theory states that the effect is caused by top performers possessing greater metacognitive ability than <b>bottom</b> <b>performers.</b> There have been many alternative theories and explanations proposed to explain the observed Dunning-Kruger effect. The current study is the first to test whether top and <b>bottom</b> <b>performers</b> base their predictions on inflated preconceived notions of ability, rather than their metacognitive ability. This theory proposes that if top and <b>bottom</b> <b>performers</b> both based their predictions of performance on their preconceived notions of ability it would create a Dunning-Kruger effect. This presupposes that that both top and <b>bottom</b> <b>performers</b> make above average estimates of performance as they hold preconceived notions of above average ability. Thus, top performers’ predictions of performance would be most accurate as their performance would be above average, whereas <b>bottom</b> <b>performers</b> would most overestimate their performance as their performance would be below average. The intention of this study was, thus, to assess whether either top or <b>bottom</b> <b>performers</b> based their predictions of performance on preconceived notions of ability or using metacognitive ability. A total of 97 university students were divided into two groups and given an identical test, one group containing 49 participants were told the test measured Logical Thinking and the remaining 48 participants were told the test measured Computational Mathematics. After completing the test, which was a 23 item preparatory test for the LSAT, participants were asked to estimate their ability in the domain being assessed, their performance relative to their peers and their score out of 23. A t-test was used to compare the two groups and it was found that the Logical Thinking and Computational Mathematical group made significantly different predictions of ability and therefore held significantly different preconceived notions of ability. Further t-tests were used to compare the estimates of ability and predictions of performance of the two groups of top and <b>bottom</b> <b>performers.</b> A significant difference was found between the two groups of top performers’ prediction of ability. However, there was no significant difference between any of the other scores of the two groups of top and <b>bottom</b> <b>performers.</b> Therefore, the alternative theory that top and <b>bottom</b> <b>performers</b> base their predictions of performance on preconceived notions of ability was found to be invalid. Therefore, the current theory which states that top performers’ superior metacognitive ability allow them to make more accurate estimates of performance than <b>bottom</b> <b>performers</b> is still the best account for the Dunning-Kruger effect.

40|$|We {{discover}} performance {{persistence in}} the equity transactions of institutional investors and their brokers {{over the period}} 1999 - 2005. Brokers (institutional clients) ranked as top performers based on execution quality outperform brokers (clients) ranked as <b>bottom</b> <b>performers</b> over adjacent periods. The broker and client persistence patterns are independent and cannot be explained by client investment style or soft dollar arrangements. The best brokers tend to specialize in certain industries, charge higher commissions, more often work the order, and can consistently execute trades with no price impact. The best performing clients tend to be larger, concentrate order flow with fewer brokers, and can robustly obtain negative trading costs, suggesting that their trading desks help create positive (investment) alpha through their trading strategies. We find that the worst brokers lose market share slowly and that the worst clients tend to specify low commission execution venues, suggesting they focus on explicit costs. Our findings imply that broker selection is an important dimension of an institution’s Best Execution obligation, and that persistence in execution performance is important enough to explain {{a significant portion of}} mutual fun...|$|R
40|$|Many {{organizations}} today use a bell-curve {{for performance}} evaluation process. They reward {{a small percentage}} of top performers, encourage a large majority in the middle to improve, and lay-off the <b>bottom</b> <b>performers.</b> Companies believe that such pay-for-performance system encourages employees to perform better. The question we explore in this paper is: does the system increase the overall performance of the company over time? We observe that pressure, if maintained below a certain level, can lead to higher performance. However, with lay-offs, constant pressure demoralizes employees, leading to drop in performance. As the company shrinks, the rigid distribution of bell-curve forces managers to label a high performer as a mediocre. A high performer, unmotivated by such artificial demotion, behaves like a mediocre. Further, managers begin to reward visible performance over the actual. Finally, the erosion of social capital could cripple the company. We recommend the use of a semi-bell-curve where someone who performs like a top performer is rewarded as one. Further, we recommend balancing pressure and morale. We recognize that such a balance is very difficult to strike, and can be successfully achieved onl...|$|R

Secondly, although the concept of homology-based inference is simple, this work revealed that the precise details of the implementation are crucial: not only did the methods span from top to <b>bottom</b> <b>performers</b> at CAFA, but also the reasons for these differences were unexpected.

We examined groups of primary care providers (PCPs) based on perceptions of screening barriers and the relationship to CRC screening rates to inform approaches for conducting barrier assessments prior to designing and implementing quality improvement interventions. Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study linking EHR and survey data. PCPs with complete survey responses for questions addressing CRC screening barriers were included (N= 166 PCPs; 39, 430 patients eligible for CRC screening). Cluster analysis identified groups of PCPs. Multivariate logistic regression estimated odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals for predictors of membership {{in one of the}} PCP groups. Results. We found two distinct groups: (1) PCPs identifying multiple barriers to CRC screening at patient, provider, and system levels (N= 75) and (2) PCPs identifying no major barriers to screening (N= 91). PCPs in the top half of CRC screening performance were more likely to identify multiple barriers than the <b>bottom</b> <b>performers</b> (OR, 4. 14; 95 % CI, 2. 43 – 7. 08). Conclusions.

30|$|A similar {{argument}} may {{be directed}} towards {{the patterns of}} performance observed on the Crowds test. Using the original criterion of 1.96 SDs above the control mean, only one participant outperformed controls. Although the Crowds test had the greatest variability in performance of both controls and self-referred SRs, it was calibrated so that performance up to 3 SDs from the control mean could be detected (as confirmed in initial pilot-testing), and correct responses were recorded from at least some participants for every trial. It is possible that this test relies on {{a different set of}} sub-processes to the other three tests, and that successful performance relies less on the face recognition system itself. Indeed, the searching of crowds requires a range of perceptual and attentional skills that are likely not employed in face recognition tasks involving the simultaneous presentation of only two or three faces. Notably, a larger proportion of the control compared to the experimental sample performed above 1 SD from the control mean, and the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>performers</b> in the experimental group displayed varied performance on the other tests in the battery. However, given that we did not test for consistency in performance on this task, we cannot firmly reach this conclusion without further testing. Alternatively, it may be the use of composite faces that has brought about differences in performance levels.|$|R

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in evaluating, ranking and training sales representatives {{arises from the}} heterogeneity in both their territories and characteristics of the representatives themselves. For example, market potential and geographical coverage may vary greatly across sales territories, and yet many managers typically use only sales or profit outcomes without accounting for territory difficulty differences. This research describes the first use of a hierarchical Bayesian model for evaluating sales representatives that can directly account for all levels of heterogeneity and variation. In addition, we demonstrate how this framework {{can be used for}} ranking sales representatives, a ubiquitous practice for purposes of awards, bonuses, and promotions and for “gap analyses”, that is assessing areas in which the sales representative is not as adept at converting potential into sales. ^ We model sales as a function of an overall representative “effect” (a random intercept model), a product-specific representative “effect” and territory level factors. Simultaneously, we model the overall representative effect as a function of representative characteristics such as years in the territory. Consistent with research in the fairness and compensation literature, our models for ranking focus solely on factors that are beyond the control of the representative. Our computational approach, using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, generates posterior samples which allows us to answer a variety of managerially relevant questions; such as who are our top and <b>bottom</b> <b>performers</b> and how certain are we about their ranks? Other outputs of the model include opportunities for improving incentive compensation and allocation of training resources. ^ We compare results to standard approaches, for a data set obtained from a large producer of pharmaceutical products, and find improved out-of-sample fit as well as divergent ranking results. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify kinematically based performance success and gender differences in elite sport rock climbers for the development of further studies and gender-specific training procedures.

Analysis was performed on the top five placing participants in each respective gender category (N = I 0). For comparison within gender, the first through third place finishers were classified as the top performers with a higher degree of performance success than the <b>bottom</b> <b>performers</b> who placed fourth and fifth (n = 5). Adjusted R-squared values were computed by way of multiple regression for the kinematic variables; variables providing adjusted R-squared coefficients greater than. 24 were selected for further analysis. A one-way repeated measures ANOV A was computed for the selected kinematic variables and finish place of the participants. Standardized mean difference effect sizes were computed to determine practical significance. No statistical significance was found at or below the. 05 level of probability for finish place and any of the kinematic variables. Effect size differences were found for the DGH and CM kinematics with the top-performing men and women exhibiting more controlled horizontal movements, and more powerful but still controlled vertical movement. The control of the vertical CM motion indicated by the tops was evident from lesser distances the CM traveled. The kinematics of the CM show the top men and women with less vertical distances traveled, indicating a more efficient movement. Gender differences included the males performing the route segment with slower times but with faster DGH events. The top men provided greater event vertical velocities while the women provided greater horizontal velocities and accelerations. These differences provide considerations for the development of specific training protocols to address performance success based requirements that are gender-specific...|$|R
40|$|PUPROSE OF THE STUDY: This thesis {{studies the}} {{persistence}} of bank performance in crises, and whether some banks are inclined to perform more weakly in crises than others. Specifically, {{the objective is to}} study whether a European bank's stock return in the Russian crisis of 1998 can explain its stock return and probability of failure in the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009. Moreover, this thesis also examines which attributes are present in those banks that performed badly in both crises. DATA AND METHODS: The sample includes 164 publicly listed companies; all the banks, financial services companies, life and nonlife insurance companies that existed both in July 1998 and in July 2007 in Thomson Reuters Datastream and that are based in one of the 16 Western European countries presented in Table 3. All sample companies are referred to as banks. I acquire stock price data from Thomson Reuters Datastream and for accounting information I use Thomson Reuters Worldscope. I gather merger data from Securities Data Company (SDC) and LexisNexis. I search the news and the annual reports of banks for information about state aid, nationalization and causes for delisting. The hypotheses are tested by estimating ordinary least squares (OLS) and logit regressions. RESULTS: The results of this thesis do not support the hypothesis that banks that perform weakly in crises have a built-in trait in their risks culture and/or their business model that makes them vulnerable in crises. I do not find evidence that European banks' stock return in the crisis of 1998 explain their stock return or increase their probability of failure in the financial crisis. Specifically, I find that a bank's weak (good) performance in the financial crisis is explained by the bank's higher (lower) systematic risk and higher (lower) ex-ante measure of systemic risk prior to the financial crisis. I also find that banks from countries with a current account surplus (deficit) performed better (worse) in the financial crisis. Banks with higher leverage, a lower book-to-market ratio and a higher market capitalization had a higher probability of failure in the financial crisis. Furthermore, I find that the banks that were in the bottom group in both crises had more idiosyncratic risk before the crisis of 1998 than other banks, whereas, they exhibited more systematic and systemic risk before the financial crisis than other banks. This finding shows that <b>bottom</b> <b>performers</b> are associated with different attributes prior to each crisis...|$|R

It is commonly recognized among health care leaders that culture will either enable or disable organizational success. However, very few studies empirically link culture to health care-specific performance outcomes. Nearly every health care organization in the US specifies its cultural aspirations through mission and vision statements and values. Ambitions of patient-centeredness, care for the community, workplace of choice, and world-class quality are frequently cited; yet, little definitive research exists to quantify the importance of building high-performing cultures. Our study examined the impact of cultural attributes defined by a culture index (Cronbach’s alpha = 0. 88) on corresponding performance with key health care measures. We mapped results of the culture index across data sets, compared results, and evaluated variations in performance among key indicators for leaders. Organizations that perform in the top quartile for our culture index statistically significantly outperformed those in the bottom quartile on all but one key performance indicator tested. The culture top quartile organizations outperformed every domain for employee engagement, physician engagement, patient experience, and overall value-based purchasing performance with statistical significance. Culture index top quartile performers also had a 3. 4 % lower turnover rate than the <b>bottom</b> quartile <b>performers.</b> Finally, culture index top quartile performers earned an additional 1 % on value-based purchasing. Our findings demonstrate a meaningful connection between performance in the culture index and organizational performance. To best impact these key performance outcomes, health care leaders should pay attention to culture and actively steer workforce engagement in attributes that represent the culture index, such as treating patients as valued customers, having congruency between employee and organizational values, promoting employee pride, and encouraging the feeling that being a member of the organization is rewarding, in order to leverage culture as a competitive advantage.

Researchers found sufficient evidence to conclude that language proficiency is related to mathematics achievement. In mathematics, symbolic language fills a dual role: It serves {{as an instrument of}} communication and as an instrument of thought by making the representation of mathematical concepts, structures and relationships possible (Esty & Teppo, 1996 : 45). According to Van Hiele (1988 : 5), language structure is a critical factor in the progression through the Van Hiele levels from the visual, concrete structures to the abstract structures. In this study, the influence of language proficiency on geometric thinking is investigated. 152 grade 8 and 9 learners completed two tests each. One test measured language proficiency in the learners' mother tongue. The second is a geometric test based on a Mayberry-type Van Hiele test for assessing learners' geometric thinking levels. Language proficiency was taken as the independent variable, and geometric thinking as the dependent variable. In the analysis of the results, the top 25 % and <b>bottom</b> 25 % <b>performers</b> in the language proficiency test were chosen. Cohen's (1988) d-value was used to determine if there was a practical significant difference in the performance of the more proficient language learners and the less proficient language learners with respect to each of the first three Van Hiele levels. Results showed a practical significant difference between the performance of the more proficient language learners and the less proficient language learners with respect to each of the first three Van Hiele levels, but also with respect to the geometry test as a whole. In particular, two aspects of language proficiency, namely reading comprehension and vocabulary, appeared to be very strong predictors for geometric thinking on the first three Van Hiele levels (d ≥ 0, 8). Key terms for indexing: geometry, geometry learning, mathematics learning, geometric thinking, language, language proficiency, geometry and language, mathematics and language. Master...|$|R
