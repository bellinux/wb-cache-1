500|$|A Thousand Splendid Suns {{received}} significant {{praise from}} reviewers, with Publishers Weekly calling it [...] "a powerful, harrowing depiction of Afghanistan" [...] and USA Today describing the prose as [...] "achingly beautiful". Lisa See of The New York Times attributed the book's success to Hosseini [...] " [...] {{the power of}} emotion as few other popular writers do". Natasha Walter from The Guardian wrote, [...] "Hosseini is skilled at telling {{a certain kind of}} story, in which events that may seem unbearable - violence, misery and abuse - are made readable. He doesn't gloss over the horrors his characters live through, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> his direct, explanatory style and the sense that you are moving towards a redemptive ending makes the whole narrative, for all its tragedies, slip down rather easily." ...|$|E

60|$|What Nicholas Snyders, recalling {{all things}} afterwards, could never {{understand}} was why he sat there, listening in patience to the stranger's talk; for, at the time, {{it seemed to him}} the jesting of a wandering fool. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the stranger had impressed him.|$|E
60|$|On the {{opposite}} side of the road were two carriages, or, rather, flys, from one of which a tall, slim man was in the act of descending. Several other men on horseback were just riding up from behind. They were all in plain clothes, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> their physique and general appearance had an unmistakable suggestion of police.|$|E
6000|$|... "Chop {{that kind}} of talk with me, you ------ ------ ------ ------!" [...] {{interrupted}} Belding. He had always been profane, and now he certainly did not choose his language. Chase turned livid, gasped, and seemed about to give way to fury. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Belding evidently exerted a powerful quieting influence. [...] "If you talk sense I'll listen," [...] went on Belding.|$|E
50|$|The poem {{itself is}} what's {{important}} to the reader, <b>but</b> knowing <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the origin of a poem may help us better understand and appreciate it and poetry in general. Understanding the cultural context {{of a work of}} literature is also vital.|$|R

60|$|She {{had been}} looking at him, puzzled. Years of {{association}} with Uncle Chris had enabled her to read his moods quickly, and she was sure {{that there was something}} on his mind. It was not likely that the others had noticed it, for his manner was as genial and urbane as ever. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> him, a look in his eyes that came and went, an occasional quick twitching of his mouth, told her that all was not well. She was a little troubled, but not greatly. Uncle Chris was not the sort of man to whom grave tragedies happened. It was probably some mere trifle which she could smooth out for him in five minutes, once they were alone together. She reached out and patted his sleeve affectionately. She was fonder of Uncle Chris than of anyone in the world except Derek.|$|E
60|$|She became conscious, {{as she was}} {{preparing}} herself for dinner, of some special attention to her toilet. She was more than ordinarily careful with her hair, and felt herself {{to be aware of}} an anxiety to look her best. She had now been for some time so accustomed to dress herself in black, that in that respect her aunt's death had made no difference to her. Deep mourning had ceased from habit to impress her with any special feeling of funereal solemnity. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> herself, or in the room, at last struck her with awe, bidding her remember how death had of late been busy among those who had been her dearest and nearest friends; and she sat down, almost frightened at her own heartlessness, in that she was allowing herself to be happy at such a time. Her aunt had been carried away to her grave only yesterday, and her brother's death had occurred under circumstances of peculiar distress within the year;--and yet she was happy, triumphant,--almost lost in the joy of her own position! She remained for a while in her chair, with her black dress hanging across her lap, as she argued with herself as to her own state of mind. Was it a sign of a hard heart within her, that she could be happy at such a time? Ought the memory of her poor brother to have such an effect upon her as to make any joy of spirits impossible to her? Should she at the present moment be so crushed by her aunt's demise, as to be incapable of congratulating herself upon her own success? Should she have told him, when he asked her that question upon the bridge, that there could be no marrying or giving in marriage between them, no talking on such a subject in days so full of sorrow as these? I do not know that she quite succeeded in recognising it as a truth that sorrow should be allowed to bar out no joy that it does not bar out of absolute necessity,--by its own weight, without reference to conventional ideas; that sorrow should never, under any circumstances, be nursed into activity, {{as though it were a}} thing in itself divine or praiseworthy. I do not know that she followed out her arguments till she had taught herself that it is the Love that is divine,--the Love which, when outraged by death or other severance, produces that sorrow which man would control if he were strong enough, but which he cannot control by reason of the weakness of his humanity. I doubt whether so much as this made itself plain to her, as she sat there before her toilet table, with her sombre dress hanging from her hands on to the ground. But something of the strength of such reasoning was hers. Knowing herself to be full of joy, she would not struggle to make herself believe that it behoved her to be unhappy. She told herself that she was doing what was good for others as well as for herself;--what would be very good for her father, and what should be good, if it might be within her power to make it so, for him who was to be her husband. The blackness of the cloud of her brother's death would never altogether pass away from her. It had tended, as she knew well, to make her serious, grave, and old, in spite of her own efforts to the contrary. The cloud had been so black with her that it had nearly lost for her the prize which was now her own. But she told herself that that blackness was an injury to her, and not a benefit, and that it had now become a duty to her,--for his sake, if not for her own,--to dispel its shadows rather than encourage them. She would go down to him full of joy, though not full of mirth, and would confess to him frankly, that in receiving the assurance of his love, she had received everything that had seemed to have any value for her in the world. Hitherto she had been independent;--she had specially been careful to show to him her resolve to be independent of him. Now she would put aside all that, and let him know that she recognised in him her lord and master as well as husband. To her father had been left no strength on which she could lean, and she had been forced therefore to trust to her own strength. Now she would be dependent on him who was to be her husband. As heretofore she had rejected his offers of assistance almost with disdain, so now would she accept them without scruple, looking to him to be her guide in all things, putting from her that carping spirit in which she had been wont to judge of his actions, and believing in him,--as a wife should believe in her husband.|$|E

5000|$|Jen of TV Over Mind gave a mixed {{review to}} the episode saying that overall {{it was a}} {{frustrating}} episode. [...] "The Vampire Diaries {{is known for its}} complex storylines, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> this season just feels tired to me. Yes, we learned of the Travelers’ true agenda but even that is still a bit confusing. Flashbacks to the past fill in more of Enzo’s story (which was long overdue) but it all led up to a pointless secret by the end." ...|$|E
5000|$|The lawyer {{supplies}} {{tickets to}} a charity function where George McCord, the actor portraying David, will be appearing. Betty meets George at the function. George is inclined to dismiss her as an overimaginative fan, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> her compels him to talk to her.

[...] "On those first recordings, I sounded like I was from Long Beach via England," [...] he later reflected. [...] "It {{was hard to}} listen to, but I mimicked the bands I loved; Siouxsie and the Banshees, Adam and the Ants, and The Damned were all English bands. There were some very cool American bands I also adored, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> a British accent made punk rock what it was." ...|$|E

His name {{is placed on the}} board, checked, and circled, in the usual manner, because he not only refuses to remove his raincoats, but also insults Mrs. Jewls. (In an unusual {{extension}} of Mrs. Jewls' violation notation system, a triangle is added around his checked and circled name for a fourth violation.) After removing all of Sammy's raincoats, it's discovered that Sammy's actually a dead rat. Because Mrs. Jewls dislikes dead rats, he is thrown away.|$|E
5000|$|... "…Holmes was {{charming and}} gracious, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> him made Belkamp {{antagonist}} uneasy. He {{could not have}} defined it. Indeed {{for the next several}} decades alienists psychologists and their successors would find themselves hard-pressed with any precision what it was about men like Holmes that caused them to seem warm and integrating but also telegraph the vague sense that some important element of humanness was missing. At first alienists described this condition as [...] "moral insanity" [...] and those who exhibited the disorder as [...] "moral imbeciles." [...] They later adopted the term [...] "psychopath"…as a [...] "new malady" [...] and stated, [...] "Besides his own person and his own interests, nothing is sacred to the psychopath." ...|$|E

I don't know why I find Carol Lay's stuff so wonderful and fascinating, <b>but</b> there's <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it that really tickles me.

5000|$|The disc {{instillation}} {{was born}} from Robert Irwin’s previous works with lines and dots. He worked with lines (on canvas) from 1957 to 1964, but the “prepositional tendency {{had the effect}} of dribbling away the viewer’s presence before the canvas" [...] (Robert Irwin). The lines led to the dots (many dots on a canvas ranging in colors which all met in the center creating the focal point), which he worked with from 1964 to 1967. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the dots didn’t sit right with Irwin. He began to question the use of the frame and edges. This led to his manipulation of light, dark, shadow, and the exhibition space, which gave the artwork the ability to “dissolve into its environment.” ...|$|E

50|$|In an {{interview}} with Michael Singer, when asked about film's ability to grant a form of immortality, Heckerling describes the experience during the accident: “There was the whole thing-the yellow light and all that stuff-and what went through my mind right then was, ‘Well, at least I got the film to the lab.’ So it’s not going to save you from anything, obviously, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it pulls you forward.” Eventually, she finished the film and held a screening that gained a very positive response, causing Heckering to call {{it one of the}} best days of her life. Her next step was to use the film to get a job. Tom Mount, president of Universal Pictures, showed {{a lot of interest in}} Heckerling but because she was not backed by an agent they could not hire her. After months of struggling to find an agent, Mount called Heckerling up on the phone and asked her to make a film.|$|E
