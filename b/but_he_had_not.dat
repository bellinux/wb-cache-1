5|$|Following a short illness, on {{the night}} of 14–15 June 1341 the emperor Andronikos III died at the {{relatively}} early age of 45, possibly due to chronic malaria. His nine-year-old son John (John V) was the obvious successor, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been officially proclaimed or crowned as co-emperor. This left a legal vacuum, and raised the question of who would lead the Empire's government.|$|E
5|$|According to Diane Dimond of Hard Copy, Torbiner's {{records show}} that Robinul and Vistarol was {{administered}} instead of sodium amytal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was investigating Torbiner's administration of drugs in house calls, where he mostly gave patients morphine and Demerol. His credentials with the Board of Dental Examiners indicated that he was restricted by law to administering drugs solely for dental-related procedures, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> adhered to those restrictions. For instance, he had given general anesthetic to Barry Rothman during hair-transplant procedures. Torbiner had introduced Chandler and Rothman in 1991, when Rothman needed dental work.|$|E
5|$|Helmholtz {{explained}} why the oscillation decayed <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> {{explained why}} it {{occurred in the}} first place. This was left to Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who, in 1853, postulated that there was inductance present in the circuit {{as well as the}} capacitance of the jar and the resistance of the load. This established the physical basis for the phenomenon - the energy supplied by the jar was partly dissipated in the load but also partly stored in the magnetic field of the inductor.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, American {{botanist}} Paul C. Standley described {{three new}} species based on collections from Panama and Costa Rica—Ficus tuerckheimii, F. isophlebia and F. jimenezii. DeWolf {{concluded that they}} were all the same species, and Berg synonymised them with F. aurea. These names have been used widely for Mexican and Central American populations, and continue to be used by some authors. Berg suspected that Ficus rzedowskiana Carvajal and Cuevas-Figueroa may also belong to this species, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> examined the original material upon which this species was based.|$|E
5|$|In August 1782, another British-Indian force {{defeated}} the Kentucky militia at the Battle of Blue Licks. Clark was the militia's senior military officer, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been {{present at the}} battle and was severely criticized in the Virginia Council for the disaster. In response, Clark led another expedition into the Ohio country, destroying several Indian villages along the Great Miami River during the Battle of Piqua, the last major expedition of the war.|$|E

He held certificate No. 144 issued by the Royal Aero Club. He later passed a formal course at the Central Flying School, Upavon in 1913, and began working as a pilot trainer there from 17 November 1913; it was intended that he would form part of a flight training school to be established in India, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet left England when the First World War broke out.|$|E

5|$|Noddack was proven {{right after}} all. Fermi had {{dismissed}} {{the possibility of}} fission {{on the basis of}} his calculations, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> taken into account the binding energy that would appear when a nuclide with an odd number of neutrons absorbed an extra neutron. For Fermi, the news came as a profound embarrassment, as the transuranic elements that he had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been transuranic elements at all, but fission products. He added a footnote to this effect to his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.|$|E
5|$|England had Stanley Matthews available, who {{was widely}} {{considered}} one of {{the best players in the}} world at the time, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> played with the English team in the three international matches before the World Cup (in fact, he had joined the team late, having been touring Canada as part of another group of English internationals). As such, the selection committee (consisting entirely of Arthur Drewry, then president of The Football League in England and later the president of FIFA) opted to stay with the team that had just defeated Chile. Matthews would be saved for later, supposedly more difficult, opponents. As there were no substitutes allowed in those days, Matthews watched the game with the other reserves. Incidentally, the England team which toured Canada beat the United States team preparing for the World Cup 1–0 at the Triborough Stadium in New York City on June 19, 10 days before the World Cup match, courtesy of a Johnny Hancocks goal.|$|E
5|$|On 4 May 1702 (O.S.) England {{formally}} {{declared war}} on France. Marlborough was given command of the English, Dutch, and hired German forces, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> as yet commanded a large army in the field, and had far less experience than a dozen Dutch and German generals who must now work under him. His command had its limitations, however. As commander of Anglo-Dutch forces he {{had the power to}} give orders to Dutch generals only when their troops were in action with his own; at all other times he had to rely on his powers of tact and persuasion, and gain the consent of accompanying Dutch field deputies or political representatives of the States General. Nevertheless, despite his Allies' initial lassitude the campaign in the Low Countries (the war's principal theatre) began well for Marlborough. After outmanoeuvring Marshal Boufflers, he captured Venlo, Roermond, Stevensweert and Liège, for which in December a grateful Queen publicly proclaimed Marlborough a duke.|$|E

5|$|On 27 May, 41-year old former Welsh {{international}} Rob Edwards {{was appointed}} new Tranmere Rovers manager with John McMahon {{staying at the}} club as assistant manager. It was the first managerial experience for Edwards, who had been an assistant at Exeter City previously. The next day, the first signing was made – 22-year old Welsh striker Eliot Richards signed a two-year contract. He was followed by his Bristol Rovers teammate midfielder Matthew Gill. Previously Gill had spent three seasons with Exeter, winning back-to-back promotions from the Conference National and League Two together with Edwards. Further Edwards signings were young central defender Michael Ihiekwe from Wolverhampton Wanderers, ex-Rotherham United striker Kayode Odejayi, 24-year old defender Marcus Holness from Burton Albion, Scottish midfielder Marc Laird released by Southend United and 30-year old defender Danny Woodards, while Evan Horwood cancelled his contract with Tranmere Rovers by mutual consent to return to Northampton Town, where he had spent end of the previous season on loan. On 4 August, ex-Tranmere Rovers player Joe Thompson had been signed by Bury. The midfielder was sidelined since November 2013 when {{he was diagnosed with}} a rare form of cancer. In June he was given the all-clear after completing a course of chemotherapy, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been contacted to negotiate a new contract with Tranmere Rovers.|$|E

25|$|Hartlepools, Derby, Brighton and Forest, {{retired from}} {{football}} in 1982, bringing {{to an end}} their partnership.

Then, in 1980, Taylor released a book, With Clough, By Taylor, which detailed their partnership, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> told Clough that he was writing the book. Six months after retiring, Taylor was appointed Derby County manager. When their teams met in the FA Cup third round in January 1983, the two managers ignored each other.|$|E

25|$|Hobart, Tasmania's capital, was the {{enforced}} home {{of many of}} Solomon's old criminal {{colleagues and}} customers. These individuals quickly recognised Solomon when he arrived on 6 October 1828. Solomon's London escape had made him a notorious fugitive, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> broken any laws in Tasmania. As a result, Tasmanian Lieutenant-Governor Colonel George Arthur could not arrest Solomon without a warrant from London. On 17 October 1828 he wrote to the Colonial Office requesting one. This warrant took 12 months to reach Tasmania. In the meantime, Solomon opened a tobacco shop/general store in Hobart's Elizabeth Street. He also began petitioning to have his wife assigned to his household.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 1964-65 season he was {{selected}} for a South African team against The Rest in a trial match for the forthcoming Test series against the visiting English team. Batting at number six he hit 107 not out, and put on an unbroken partnership of 267 for the fifth wicket with Bland. He was selected to keep wicket for the first three Tests. He top-scored in the first innings of the First Test with 38, and kept through an English innings of 531 in the Second Test without conceding a bye, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> made the quick runs South Africa needed, and after the Third Test he was dropped in favour of Waite.|$|E
25|$|The Prince of Carignano, {{searching the}} {{destruction}} of the retreating French army, dispatched Ottavio Piccolomini in command of his cavalry and Johann von Werth with the Spanish cavalry behind the Count of Soissons, who was forced to pass the Oise river. The harassment of the German and Spanish cavalry diminished the strength of the French army, finding the Imperial-Spanish troops abandoned corpses and weapons at his advance. Piccolomini's persecution of the retreating French army lead him to Roye, which he captured and from where he reached Compiègne and advanced further into French territory, which caused consternation in Paris. Meanwhile, Soissons retreated to Noyon pursued by Johann von Werth. The Bavarian general destroyed 5 French cavalry regiments near the town, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> enough forces to attempt its capture.|$|E
