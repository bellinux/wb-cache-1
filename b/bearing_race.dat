500|$|PWM drives are {{inherently}} associated with high-frequency common-mode voltages and currents which may cause trouble with motor bearings. When these high-frequency voltages find {{a path to}} earth through a bearing, transfer of metal or electrical discharge machining (EDM) sparking occurs between the bearing's ball and the bearing's race. Over time, EDM-based sparking causes erosion in the <b>bearing</b> <b>race</b> {{that can be seen}} as a fluting pattern. In large motors, the stray capacitance of the windings provides paths for high-frequency currents that pass through the motor shaft ends, leading to a circulating type of bearing current. [...] Poor grounding of motor stators can lead to shaft-to-ground bearing currents. Small motors with poorly grounded driven equipment are susceptible to high-frequency bearing currents.|$|E

Brown's design embodied his effort to keep the two bearing surfaces of an axle, fixed and moving, apart. Brown worked closely with Joseph Henry Hughes, who drew up the patent for a ball or roller <b>bearing</b> <b>race</b> for bicycle and carriage wheels in 1877. Hughes' patent included {{all the elements of}} an adjustable system. These two men are thus responsible for modern roller skate and skateboard wheels, as well as the ball <b>bearing</b> <b>race</b> inclusion in velocipedes—later to become motorbikes and automobiles. This was arguably the most important advance in the realistic use of roller skates as a pleasurable pastime.|$|E

50|$|A {{common cause}} of {{brinelling}} {{is the use of}} improper installation procedures. Brinelling often occurs when pressing bearings into holes or onto shafts. Care must usually be taken to ensure that pressure is applied to the proper <b>bearing</b> <b>race</b> to avoid transferring the pressure from one race to the other through the balls or rollers. If pressing force is applied to the wrong race, brinelling can occur to either or both of the races. The act of pressing or clamping can also leave brinell marks, especially if the vise or press has serrated jaws or roughened surfaces. Flat pressing plates are often used in the pressing of bearings, while soft copper, brass, or aluminum jaw covers are often used in vises to help avoid brinell marks from being forced into the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|The main {{components}} of a VMCM are its two orthogonal cosine response propeller sensors, that directly measure the components of horizontal velocity parallel to their axes. The orientation of the instrument with respect to magnetic north is sensed with a flux-gate compass, which permits to evaluate the direction of flux, providing {{the angle of the}} Y axis with respect to the magnetic North.A microprocessor rotates the X-Y coordinates in the conventional East-West and North-South components of velocity. This is done once each sample interval and, {{at the end of the}} record interval, the conventional components of velocity are averaged and the averages are stored on a cassette magnetic tape. Other components of the system are a bearing retainer, an end cap, an outer <b>bearing</b> <b>race,</b> a ball retainer and bearing balls, an encoder and an epoxy or Noryl plastic disk with four magnets, pressure window, an aluminum disk, two magnetodiodes mounted asymmetrically on a printed circuit ring, a hub, and a shaft with inner races machined in it. The function of the magnetodiodes is detecting the rotation of the propeller sensors.|$|E

50|$|A dustcap {{may also}} refer, on a bicycle, {{to the metal}} ring that covers the {{bearings}} in a cup-and-cone ball-bearing hubset. These types of dust caps, being press-fit, are difficult to remove with bending or damaging them. It is suggested to press them out {{from the other side}} of the hub using a screw driver. In this role the dustcap reduces the dust that enters the <b>bearing</b> <b>races,</b> and extends service intervals.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{lubricant}} is removed, the <b>bearings</b> and <b>races</b> {{can touch}} directly. While <b>bearings</b> and <b>races</b> appear smooth to the eye, they are microscopically rough. Thus, high points of each surface can touch, but [...] "valleys" [...] do not. The bearing load is thus spread over much less area increasing the contact stress, causing pieces of each surface {{to break off}} or to become pressure-welded then break off when the bearing rolls on.|$|R
