5|$|Monroe's troubled {{private life}} {{received}} much attention. She struggled with substance abuse, depression, and anxiety. She had two highly publicized marriages, to retired baseball star Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller, {{both of which}} ended in divorce. On August 5, 1962, she died at age 36 from an overdose of <b>barbiturates</b> {{at her home in}} Los Angeles.

5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the <b>barbiturates,</b> {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E
40|$|The anesthetic-sedative <b>barbiturate</b> {{pentobarbital}} (PB) and the anticonvulsant <b>barbiturate</b> phenobarbital (PhB) {{were applied}} to mammalian spinal cord neurons in primary dissociated cell culture to assess their effects on: (1) postsynaptic GABA-responses; (2) paroxysmal activity produced by the convulsant bicuculline; (3) resting membrane properties; and (4) spontaneous neuronal activity. The results demonstrated that: (1) anticonvulsant actions occured at <b>barbiturate</b> concentrations which augmented GABA-responses; (2) anesthetic actions occurred at <b>barbiturate</b> concentrations which produced direct increases in chloride conductance; (3) both anticonvulsant and anesthetic actions occurred at clinically relevant concentrations; and (4) concentrations of PhB, but not PB, which produced GABA-augmentation and direct conductance changes were widely separated. These findings support the hypotheses that augmentation of GABA-mediated inhibition and possibly reduction of glutamate (GLU) -mediated excitation form the basis {{at least in part}} for <b>barbiturate</b> anticonvulsant action and that addition of direct increases in chloride conductance to augmentation of GABA-mediated inhibition and reduction of GLU-mediated excitation may partially underlie anesthetic-sedative <b>barbiturate</b> action...|$|R

5|$|As {{with similar}} {{substances}} with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as <b>barbiturates</b> and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from alcohol dependence {{can be fatal}} {{if it is not}} properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor, promoting central nervous system depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in tolerance and physical dependence. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life-threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure. Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.|$|E
5|$|There is {{controversy}} {{concerning the}} safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy. While they are not major teratogens, uncertainty remains {{as to whether they}} cause cleft palate in a small number of babies and whether neurobehavioural effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure; they are known to cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness. However, they are less toxic than their predecessors, the <b>barbiturates,</b> and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken. When combined with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as alcoholic drinks and opioids, the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases. Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse.|$|E
5|$|Prescribed 90 {{medications}} {{during the}} war years by his personal physician, Theodor Morell, Hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments.

5|$|During this period, Monroe {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for being difficult on film sets; the difficulties worsened as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at all, did not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance. Monroe's dependence on her acting coaches—first Natasha Lytess and later Paula Strasberg—also irritated directors. Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, low self-esteem, and stage fright; she disliked the lack of control she had on her work on film sets, and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script. To alleviate her anxiety and chronic insomnia, she began to use <b>barbiturates,</b> amphetamines and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956. According to Sarah Churchwell, some of Monroe's behavior especially later in her career was also in response to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors. Similarly, Lois Banner has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.|$|E
5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, <b>barbiturates</b> and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E
5|$|Methods of euthanizing {{laboratory}} {{animals are}} chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as <b>barbiturates</b> can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.|$|E

40|$|Current {{methods of}} {{treatment}} of <b>barbiturate</b> poisoning, which consist of supportive measures aimed towards maintenance of life until the drug can be excreted or metabolized, have occasioned considerable dissatisfaction {{because of their}} lack of specificity. Ideal therapy must be directed to-ward either more rapid removal or accelerated de-toxification of the <b>barbiturate</b> preparation. The closest approach to this goal has been the use of massive intravenous infusions to initiate diuresis with consequently more rapid urinary excretion of the drug. Morbidity and mortality in {{a significant number of}} patients with <b>barbiturate</b> toxicity are not directly related to the primary depressant effect of the drug. Many patients, especially in the older age group, die because of respiratory difficulties. Mor-bidity at all ages is often increased by such com-plications. The number and severity of these could be reduced if the drug were removed from the body more rapidly, thus shortening the period of coma. The application of massive hydration (1) or cross-circulation of a poisoned dog with a large untreated animal (2) has been shown to permit survival of narcotized dogs given doses of barbitu-rate that ordinarily prove fatal. These studies in-dicated that permanent fixation of <b>barbiturate</b> to tissues is not the major factor in mortality and strongly suggested that beneficial effect might re-sult from lowering of the blood <b>barbiturate</b> level, irrespective of the total amount of <b>barbiturate</b> con-tained within the body.

25|$|There {{are special}} risks to {{consider}} for older adults, {{women who are}} pregnant, and babies. When a person ages, the body becomes less able to rid itself of <b>barbiturates.</b> As a result, people {{over the age of}} sixty-five are at higher risk of experiencing the harmful effects of <b>barbiturates,</b> including drug dependence and accidental overdose. When <b>barbiturates</b> are taken during pregnancy, the drug passes through the placenta to the fetus. After the baby is born, it may experience withdrawal symptoms and have trouble breathing. In addition, nursing mothers who take <b>barbiturates</b> may transmit the drug to their babies through breast milk. A rare adverse reaction to <b>barbiturates</b> is Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which primarily affects the mucous membranes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Barbiturates</b> in {{high doses}} {{are used for}} physician-assisted suicide (PAS), and in {{combination}} with a muscle relaxant for euthanasia and for capital punishment by lethal injection. <b>Barbiturates</b> are frequently employed as euthanizing agents in small-animal veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Barbiturates</b> act as {{positive}} allosteric modulators, and at higher doses, as agonists of GABAA receptors. GABA {{is the principal}} inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). <b>Barbiturates</b> bind to the GABAA receptor at multiple homologous transmembrane pockets located at subunit interfaces, which are binding sites distinct from GABA itself and also distinct from the benzodiazepine binding site. Like benzodiazepines, <b>barbiturates</b> potentiate the effect of GABA at this receptor. In addition to this GABAergic effect, <b>barbiturates</b> also block AMPA and kainate receptors, subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptor. Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS. Taken together, the findings that <b>barbiturates</b> potentiate inhibitory GABAA receptors and inhibit excitatory AMPA receptors can explain the superior CNS-depressant effects of these agents to alternative GABA potentiating agents such as benzodiazepines and quinazolinones. At higher concentration, they inhibit the Ca2+-dependent release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate via an effect on P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channels.|$|E
