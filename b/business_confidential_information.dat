40|$|Abstract There are {{demands for}} secure group {{communication}} on the internet, such as pay-per-view type broadcasting, <b>business</b> <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> sharing and teleconference. Secure communication inside a groups {{on an open}} network is critical to enhance the internet capability. The public key system {{is not sufficient to}} support the group security, since it is not scalable for large groups. Some researchers propose a scalable group security model, managing several common keys for encryption and decryption sharing inside the community. In this paper, we will evaluate the performance of these group security model. Using M/G/ ∞ queueing models and the basic queueing theory, we show how to find the optimal condition of the allocation of the common keys if the joins to group is a Poisson process. In addition, we show our optimal condition may work for more general arrival processes by using the cross covariance formula (a variant of Papangelou’s formula) for the stochastic intensity of departure process...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Commerce generates and disseminates important economic information that is {{of great interest to}} U. S. businesses, policymakers, and researchers. The dramatic rise in the number and sophistication of cyberattacks on federal information systems is of growing concern. This report provides a general summary of the computer security weaknesses in the unclassified information systems of seven Commerce organizations {{as well as in the}} management of the department's information security program. The significant and pervasive weaknesses in the seven Commerce bureaus place the data and operations of these bureaus at serious risk. Sensitive economic, personnel, financial, and <b>business</b> <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> is exposed, allowing potential intruders to read, copy, modify, or delete these data. Moreover, critical operations could effectively cease in the event of accidental or malicious service disruptions. Poor detection and response capabilities exacerbate the bureaus' vulnerability to intrusions. As demonstrated during GAO's testing, the bureaus' general inability to notice GAO's activities increases the likelihood that intrusions will not be detected in time to prevent or minimize damage. These weaknesses are attributable to the lack of an effective information security program with a lack of centralized management, a risk-based approach, up-to-date security policies, security awareness and training, and continuous monitoring of the bureaus' compliance with established policies and the effectiveness of implemented controls. These weaknesses are exacerbated by Commerce's highly interconnected computing environment. A compromise in a single poorly secured system can undermine the security of the multiple systems that connect to it. ...|$|E
40|$|The need to {{maintain}} <b>business</b> <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> within the company are increasing in today’s knowledge-based society. Today, trade secrets are an asset for entrepreneurs and important for competitiveness. These secrets are sometimes provided to the employees and the more secrets spread, the more vulnerable the employer becomes. To prevent trade secrets from being disclosed there is a law about confidential information and competition clauses could be entered in the employment contracts. Nevertheless, {{the need to protect}} confidential information must be compared to the right of workers to freely use their skills. This paper aims to highlight the legal situation and the legal balance between both parts within the law of confidential information and competition clauses {{on the basis of a}} legal science method. It also aims to highlight the use of non-compete agreements from a gender perspective. The purpose of the paper has led to the following research questions; How can the legal framework of trade secrets and compete clauses be understood from an employer and employee perspective and what are the consequences of it? From a gender perspective, what consequences does the balance between the employer’s need to protect confidential information and the employees’ need to be competitive on the labor market after an employment have? The paper shows that there are weaknesses in the law of confidential information through the employer’s perspective and the law does not stall the employees’ competitiveness. The non-compete agreements however, may jeopardize the movement of the employees and are often seen as unfair in Swedish court. However, the problem is that the freedom of enter contracts prevails and the agreements are valid until an arbitration or court shows otherwise. The study indicates that it is mostly men that are subject to compete clauses, which can lead to improvement of women’s position in the labor market. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Is cybercrime, cyber espionage, {{and other}} {{malicious}} cyber activities {{what some call}} “the greatest transfer of wealth in human history,” or is it what others say is a “rounding error in a fourteen trillion dollar economy?” The wide range of existing estimates of the annual loss—from a few billion dollars to hundreds of billions—reflects several difficulties. Companies conceal their losses and some {{are not aware of}} what has been taken. Intellectual property is hard to value. Some estimates relied on surveys, which provide very imprecise results unless carefully constructed. One common problem with cybersecurity surveys is that those who answer the questions “self-select,” introducing a possible source of distortion into the results. Given the data collection problems, loss estimates are based on assumptions about scale and effect— change the assumption and you get very different results. These problems leave many estimates open to question. The Components of Malicious Cyber Activity In this initial report we start by asking what we should count in estimating losses from cybercrime and cyber espionage. We can break malicious cyber activity into six parts: 	The loss of intellectual property and <b>business</b> <b>confidential</b> <b>information</b> 	Cybercrime, which costs the world {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} every year 	The loss of sensitive business information, including possible stock market manipulation 	Opportunity costs, including service and employment disruptions, and reduced trust for online activities 	The additional cost of securing networks, insurance, and recovery from cyber attacks 	Reputational damage to the hacked company Put these together and the cost of cybercrime and cyber espionage to the global economy is probably measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars. To put this in perspective, the World Bank says that global GDP was about $ 70 trillion in 2011. A $ 400 billion loss—the high end of the range of probable costs—would be a fraction of a percent of global income. But this begs several important questions about the full benefit to the acquirers and the damage to the victims from the cumulative effect of cybercrime and cyber espionage...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Virtual organisations (VO) allow {{independent}} organisations {{to share}} resources and collaborate to achieve common goals.

Furthermore, business contexts the VO need to adapt quickly {{to changes in the}} environment. Maintaining security in a dynamic environment is particularly challenging open issue in current Grids. The security issues are not only related to the protection from the outside world but also to the protection of the integrity and confidentiality of each organisation against potentially conflicting goals within the VO. To tackle this problem, this paper shows how the general Chinese wall security model can be adapted for use in Gridbased VO. The result is a reusable Chinese wall pattern that is expressed in terms of a VO ontology. The pattern formalization is also proved using the Alloy SAT-based technology. This work is a first step towards deploying Chinese walls in operational Grid-based VO...|$|R
