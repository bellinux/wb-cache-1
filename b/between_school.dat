5|$|Born on New Providence Island, she {{completed}} her secondary education {{and became a}} teacher. After teaching for 17 years, Johnson returned to school to earn a master's and doctorate degree in educational administration. During this period, she traveled back and forth <b>between</b> <b>school</b> and her Bahamian home organizing labor and suffrage efforts. Upon graduation, Johnson {{was unable to find}} work because of her activism. She made a compelling speech to the Bahamian legislature in 1959, pleading for women's suffrage and subsequently made a similar plea to the Colonial Office in London. Once the right to vote had been secured, Johnson immediately entered politics in 1961, running in the first election in which women were allowed to participate. Though she lost her bid, she worked with the Progressive Liberal Party to gain Bahamian independence. When the country gained its freedom from colonial rule, Johnson was appointed to the Senate and served the government until her death, a decade later.|$|E
5|$|The Inquirers {{circulation}} {{has been}} dropping since the 1980s, {{and except for}} briefly seeing a rise in weekday circulation in 2007, The Philadelphia Inquirers weekday and Sunday circulation has continued to steadily drop since Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the paper. Loss of circulation combined with an unexpected drop in advertising revenue have forced more than 400 job cuts at The Inquirer and Daily News since they were bought by Philadelphia Media Holdings. As Philadelphia Media Holdings financial situation worsened in 2008 employees began complaining about how management has been monitoring things such as bathroom breaks and the coffee they drink, and that Tierney has been patrolling the parking garage seeing what time employees arrive for work. Despite efforts to manage the financial strain, on February 21, 2009, Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, the subsidiary of Philadelphia Media Holdings that owns the paper, filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company hoped to restructure the US$390 million in debt it borrowed to buy the newspapers, but the end result was that the papers were auctioned off to the company's lenders. The beginning of 2009 also saw the filing of a lawsuit that accused The Philadelphia Inquirer of writing critical stories about Chester Community Charter School's use of public funds after business negotiations <b>between</b> <b>school</b> operator Vahan H. Gureghian and Tierney failed.|$|E

In the break <b>between</b> <b>school</b> years, Ross instituted a number of changes. When students returned for the 18911892 school year, they found a new three-story dormitory with 41 rooms (named Ross Hall), the beginning of construction on a new home for the president, and a new building to house the machine and blacksmith shops. The minimum age for enrollment decreased from 16 to 15, and Ross now personally interviewed all prospective students {{to determine if they}} should be admitted. Fees and expenses rose by $10 per session, and the number of hours required for graduation increased, including additional hours in English grammar, sciences, mathematics, and history. Additionally, Ross would now appoint the officers for the Corps of Cadets, {{and the name of the}} company of best-drilled cadets in the Corps would change to the Ross Volunteers (from Scott Volunteers). Finally, Ross enacted an official prohibition against hazing, vowing to expel any student found guilty of the practice.

2500|$|Private gifted {{assessment}} is usually expensive and educators recommend that parents {{take advantage of}} online screening tests to give a preliminary indication of potential giftedness. Another way to screen for giftedness before requesting a psychological {{assessment is}} to do a curriculum-based assessment. [...] Curriculum-based assessment {{is a form of}} achievement testing that focuses specifically on what the child has been exposed to in their academic career. It can be done through school or a private educational center. Although this can determine if a child's performance in school potentially signifies giftedness, there are complications. For example, if a child changes school districts or country of residence, the different terminology of curriculum could hold that child back. Secondly, discrepancies <b>between</b> <b>school</b> districts, along with public and private education, create a very wide range of potential knowledge bases.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{listing of}} the {{sequence}} of sketches reprinted in Monty Python: The Case Against by Robert Hewison reveals that the film was to have begun {{with a set of}} sketches at an English public school.

The song [...] "All Things Dull and Ugly" [...] and the parody scripture reading [...] "Martyrdom of St. Victor" [...] were performed on Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album (1980). The idea of a violent rugby match <b>between</b> <b>school</b> masters and small boys was filmed in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (1983). A sketch about a boy who dies at school appeared on the unreleased The Hastily Cobbled Together for a Fast Buck Album (1981).|$|E
2500|$|After a few years, he {{was sent}} to St. Paul's School, which was run by Alexander Gil, William Sound, and Oliver Smythe. Gil had a {{reputation}} for scholarship in Greek, Latin, and theology. He was also a proponent of English grammar structures and relied on poetry, including that written by Edmund Spenser and Philip Sidney, to discuss the English language. Milton travelled each day <b>between</b> <b>school</b> and home, and his path took him by St Paul's. It is possible that he listened to the sermons put on during this time by John Donne. John Aubrey, in Brief Lives, quotes his brother Christopher to describe how Milton spent his time: [...] "When he went to school, when he was very young, he studied very hard and sat up very late, commonly till twelve or one o'clock at night; and his father ordered the main to sit up for him". Milton later attributed his blindness, in his Defensio Secunda, to the rigorous study that he undetook during this time.|$|E
