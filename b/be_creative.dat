5|$|Aarhus {{is home to}} many annual {{cultural}} events and festivals, museums, theatres, and sport events of both national and international importance, and presents {{some of the largest}} cultural attractions in Denmark. There is a long tradition here in music of all genres and many Danish bands have emerged from Aarhus. Libraries, cultural centres and educational institutions present free or easy opportunities for the citizens to participate in, engage in, or <b>be</b> <b>creative</b> with {{cultural events}} and productions of all kinds.|$|E
5|$|All {{episodes of}} the first season were written by Sam Egan and Kindler; Kindler hired Egan to assist in writing the first season, as he {{believed}} Egan to <b>be</b> <b>creative,</b> passionate, and talented. Several episodes {{of the first}} season were written throughout the Christmas season in 2007. After the series was given the green-light, they were rewritten to establish a season-long storyline. Some of the episodes finished their writing stage as little as {{two and a half}} weeks before filming commenced. At times after the scripts were written, Sci Fi executive Mark Stern fed back to the writers, asking for certain elements to be explained so the audience could understand.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Moo, You Bloody Choir saw Richards {{expected}} by record label Sony BMG {{to produce a}} quality follow-up. He denied being under significant pressure, though {{the persistence of the}} label—"Richo, have you got a single? Do you have singles? Please, do you have singles?"—was noted. Much of the writing for Augie March's fourth album took place while touring the United States, which Richards argued minimised the band's opportunities to <b>be</b> <b>creative.</b> In 2008, Augie March began recording Watch Me Disappear at Neil Finn's Auckland studios; they also recorded in Melbourne, Sydney, and Los Angeles. The band worked primarily in New Zealand {{to get away from the}} distraction of Melbourne, their hometown, thus allowing them to focus solely on recording.|$|E

25|$|Music therapy {{comes in}} two {{different}} forms: active and receptive. In active therapy, the therapist and patient actively participate in creating music with instruments, their voice, or other objects. This allows for the patient to <b>be</b> <b>creative</b> and expressive through the art of music. Receptive therapy {{takes place in a}} more relaxed setting where the therapist plays or makes music to the patient who is free to draw, listen or meditate. Usually the therapist determines the method unless specifically requested by the patient.|$|E

25|$|The Sneinton Festival {{has three}} elements: initial workshops, a week-long festival, {{and the final}} carnival. Workshops {{organised}} by The Festival Group {{take place in the}} run-up to the festival, and bring young people together to <b>be</b> <b>creative</b> around the year's theme, building the artwork, decorations and costumes, as well as holding dance and performance workshops. The Festival Week begins on a Saturday, and involves seven days of arts-based free and open events held in and around Sneinton. Festival Week culminates in a parade held on Carnival Day, on the next Saturday. The Carnival Parade includes floats, fancy dress, costumes, samba bands, jazz bands, youth bands, dancers, and a variety of other event performers. The festival then continues in the Hermitage Square when the parade arrives, and features an afternoon of free and diverse entertainment.|$|E
25|$|When Warwick {{presented}} the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures entitled The Rise of Robots {{in the year}} 2000, the lectures were well received by some. However, in a letter Simon Colton complained about the choice of Warwick, prior to his appearance. He claimed that Warwick is not a spokesman for our subject (Artificial Intelligence) and allowing him influence through the Christmas lectures is {{a danger to the}} public perception of science. Due to Warwick's claims that computers could <b>be</b> <b>creative,</b> Colton, who is a Reader in Computational Creativity, also said the AI community has done real science to reclaim words such as creativity and emotion which they claim computers will never have. Subsequent letters were generally positive; Ralph Rayner wrote With my youngest son, I attended all of the lectures and found them balanced and thought-provoking. They were not sensationalist. I applaud Warwick for his lectures.|$|E
500|$|The three {{sections}} {{of a typical}} session are the warm-up, the action, and the sharing. [...] During the warm-up, the actors are encouraged {{to enter into a}} state of mind where they can be present in and aware of the current moment and are free to <b>be</b> <b>creative.</b> [...] This is done through the use of different ice-breaker games and activities. [...] Next, the action section of the psychodrama session is the time in which the actual scenes themselves take place. [...] Finally, in the post-discussion, the different actors are able to comment on the action, coming from their personal point of view, not as a critique, [...] sharing their empathy and experiences with the protagonist of the scene.|$|E

500|$|Keith Farrell of Compute!'s Gazette {{was struck}} by Maniac Mansions {{similarity}} to film, particularly in its use of cutscenes to impart [...] "information or urgency". He lauded the game's graphics, animation and high level of detail. Commodore Users Bill Scolding and three reviewers from Zzap!64 compared the game to The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Further comparisons were drawn to Psycho, Friday the 13th, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The Addams Family and Scooby-Doo. Russ Ceccola of Commodore Magazine found the cutscenes to <b>be</b> <b>creative</b> and well made, and he commented that the [...] "characters are distinctively Lucasfilm's, bringing facial expressions and personality to each individual character". In Compute!, Orson Scott Card praised the game's humor, cinematic storytelling and lack of violence. He called it [...] "compellingly good" [...] and evidence of Lucasfilm's push [...] "to make computer games a valid storytelling art".|$|E
