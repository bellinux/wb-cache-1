5|$|A similar {{source of}} funds {{was to be the}} tax on exports of cotton. However, in {{addition}} to the difficulties associated with the blockade, the self-imposed embargo on cotton meant that for all practical purposes the tax was completely ineffective as a fund raiser. Initial optimistic estimates of revenue to be collected through this tax ran as high as 20 million dollars, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> only $30 thousand was collected.|$|E

5|$|A {{circumstance}} {{occurred during}} the action which so strongly marks the invincible spirit of British seamen, when engaging the enemies of their country, that I cannot resist the pleasure I have in making it known to their Lordships; the Temeraire was boarded by accident; or design, by a French ship on one side, and a Spaniard on the other; the contest was vigorous, <b>but,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> the combined ensigns were torn from the poop and the British hoisted in their places. Collingwood's account, probably based largely on Harvey's report {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the battle, contained several errors.

Nevertheless, the account was popular and a print was rushed out purporting to show Harvey taking the lead in clearing Temeraires decks of enemy seamen.|$|E

The Demon Deacons won the ACC Finals again, but in the Sweet 16, Duncan came down with the flu, and his team missed the Final Four by one win. He completed another remarkable season with averages of 19.1 points and 12.3 rebounds per game, and was again voted ACC Defensive Player of the Year and won his first ACC Player of the Year award. At the season's end the Wake Forest star was rumored to enter the 1996 NBA draft, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> he stayed in college.|$|E
