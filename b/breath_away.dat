And all along, the riveting friendship {{between the two}} polarized women and the events that bring them together, keep tugging at your heart. Shreyas Talpade proves that (his previous film), Iqbal was no accident and Gul Panag gives {{one of the most}} convincing portrayals of her career. But, it is Ayesha Takia who simply blows your <b>breath</b> <b>away.</b> Her journey from joyous subjugation — where she is content to dance before her husband and be at the beck and call of her in-laws — to silent emancipation is absolutely endearing.|$|E
500|$|The {{performances}} of Amelia Bullmore and Nicola Walker in the Series 3 finale were highly praised. Julia Raeside of The Guardian commented that both [...] "give an incredible acting masterclass {{that will take}} your <b>breath</b> <b>away.</b> Truly gripping and the jewel in ITV's increasingly impressive drama crown. Splendid stuff." [...] The series was nominated for the BAFTA TV award for Best Drama Series in both 2012 and 2013.|$|E

Smith also opened the Serenata festival. Angela Young, reviewing the festival for the Bournemouth Daily Echo, said [...] "Faryl Smith was my personal highlight of the Thursday night line-up, her bizarrely powerful voice (considering her diminutive size and age) taking my <b>breath</b> <b>away</b> and it contrasted so well with her naivete as she said 'at least it's not raining' – just as the heavens opened." ...|$|E

500|$|Kenneth Turan found [...] "so much is {{happening}} {{you feel the}} immediate need of a sequel just {{as a reward for}} absorbing it all. While X-Men doesn't take your <b>breath</b> <b>away</b> wire-to-wire the way The Matrix did, it's an accomplished piece of work with considerable pulp watchability to it." [...] ReelReviews.net's James Berardinelli, an X-Men comic book fan, believed, [...] "the film is effectively paced with a good balance of exposition, character development, and special effects-enhanced action. Neither the plot nor the character relationships are difficult to follow, and the movie avoids the trap of spending too much time explaining things that don't need to be explained. X-Men fandom is likely to be divided over whether the picture is a success or a failure". Desson Thomson of The Washington Post commented, [...] "he movie's enjoyable on the surface, but I suspect many people, even die-hards, will be less enthusiastic about what lies, or doesn't, underneath".|$|E
500|$|Wallace Harrison's assistant, {{architect}} George Dudley, later stated: [...] "It literally {{took our}} <b>breath</b> <b>away</b> {{to see the}} simple plane of the site kept open from First Avenue to the River, only three structures on it, standing free, a fourth lying low behind them along the river’s edge... also said, ‘beauty {{will come from the}} buildings being in the right space!’. The comparison between Le Corbusier’s heavy block and Niemeyer’s startling, elegantly articulated composition {{seemed to me to be}} in everyone’s mind..." [...] Later on, Corbusier came once again to Niemeyer and asked him to reposition the Assembly Hall back to the center of the site. Such modification would destroy Niemeyer’s plans for a large civic square. However, he finally decided to accept the modification: [...] "I felt [...] would like to do his project, and he was the master. I do not regret my decision." [...] Together, they submitted the scheme 23–32, which was built and is what can be seen today. Along with suggestions from the other members of the Board of Design Consultants, this was developed into project 42G. [...] This late project was built with some reductions and other modifications.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the digital}} sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Little Mix's vocal {{range in the}} song span from the note of Eb3 to Cb5. Written in the key of E minor, the track is set in common time at a moderate tempo of 70 beats per minute. [...] Lyrically, [...] "DNA" [...] uses scientific vocabulary to portray themes of love and obsession. Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman wrote that the song lionises a strong man. 4Music's Trent Maynard said that it paints a moody picture of love and deep seated biological compatibility. The chorus includes the lyrics, [...] "It's in his DNA, D-D-D-DNA / It's in his DNA / And he just takes my <b>breath</b> <b>away,</b> b-b-b-breath away / I feel it every day / And that's what makes a man, not hard to understand / Perfect in every way, I see it in-his-face / Nothing more to say, it's in his D-D-D-D-DNA". Leigh-Anne Pinnock does the song's half-spoken half-rapped middle eight in a spooky tone, mentioning, [...] "It's all about his kiss, contaminates my lips, our energy connects, it's simple genetics, I'm the X to his Y". Music website, Popjustice, likened the song to British girl group, the Spice Girls, writing, [...] "'DNA' is the 'Say You'll Be There' to the 'Wannabe' of 'Wings'".|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "one of those rare movies where I wanted {{to sit in the}} front row and let the images wash out to the edges of my field of vision". Broadway star Nathan Lane, who was the voice of Timon the meerkat in The Lion King, has said Finding Nemo was his {{favorite}} animated film. Ed Park of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's an ocean of eye candy that tastes fresh even in this ADD-addled era of SpongeBob SquarePants." [...] Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "You connect to these sea creatures as you rarely do with humans in big-screen adventures. The result: a true sunken treasure." [...] Hazel-Dawn Dumpert of L.A. Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "As gorgeous a film as Disney's ever put out, with astonishing qualities of light, movement, surface and color at the service of the best professional imaginations money can buy." [...] Jeff Strickler of the Star Tribune gave the film a positive review, saying it [...] "proves that even when Pixar is not at the top of its game, it still produces better animation than some of its competitors on their best days." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "The underwater backdrops take your <b>breath</b> <b>away.</b> No, really. They're so lifelike, you almost feel like holding your breath while watching." [...] Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Parental anxiety may not be the kind of stuff children's films are usually made of, but this perfectly enchanting movie knows how to cater to its kiddie audience without condescending to them." ...|$|E

Speaking of finding an {{acceptable}} mate, in 1974 she told Peter Knobler in Crawdaddy, [...] "...he's real kind but isn't inspired musically, {{and then you}} meet somebody else that's just so inspired musically that he just takes your <b>breath</b> <b>away,</b> but he's such a moron, such a maniac that you can't get along with him.

2500|$|Luke Davies of The Monthly {{applauded the}} film for recreating [...] "the atmosphere, {{the sense of}} hope and battle; even the sound design, bustling with street noise, adds much vibrancy to the tale", but voiced criticisms {{in regard to the}} message of the film, stating [...] "while the film is a {{political}} narrative in a grand historical sense, the murder of Milk is neither a political assassination nor an act of homophobic rage. Rather, it is an act of revenge for perceived wrongs and public humiliation," [...] Davies continues to postulate that [...] "It seems as likely that Milk would have been murdered were he heterosexual. So the film can't be the heroic tale of a political martyr it needs to be in order to hold us and take our <b>breath</b> <b>away.</b> It's a simpler story, about a man who fought an extraordinary political fight and who was killed, arbitrarily and unnecessarily." [...] Although Davies found Penn's portrayal of Milk moving, he adds that [...] "on a minor but troubling note, there are times when Penn's version of 'gay' acting veers dangerously close to a twee version of his childlike (read: 'mentally retarded') acting in I Am Sam." [...] All his criticisms aside, Davies concludes that [...] "the heart of the film– and while it is not perfect, it is uplifting– lies in Penn's portrayal of Milk's generosity of spirit.|$|E

2500|$|Anorthosis Famagusta {{defeated}} by AEL Limassol On antonis Papapdopoulos on February 12. A good pace and alternating leadership contest began. The game was balanced {{in the first}} 20 minutes, without any stands of the two groups. The first major opportunity arose to Anorthosis when Okkas won a penalty reversal by Carlitos. The Vincent Laban (24') {{but was unable to}} send the ball into the net against the Degra, the Argentine goalkeeper proved once again this year unbeaten from the eleven steps.

The two teams alternated possession of the ball and the superiority early in the second half. Without getting specific risks in their play, they tried to be especially threatening to some individual efforts, but struggled to create great opportunities in front of their homes and the Degra, Kozáčik. Eventually the AEL Limassol was able to get ahead in the score ... pitched ringing in one phase, the Dosa Júnior (84') to be anointed scorer with a header after a corner Monteiro. Anorthosis then pressed in order to reach the equalizer, with Okkas to neglect immediately after (84') and Dédé stopped him in an exemplary manner.
