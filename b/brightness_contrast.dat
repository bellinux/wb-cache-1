5|$|Modulation {{of neural}} {{responses}} may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In {{contrast to the}} raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with {{an important aspect of}} consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (<b>brightness,</b> <b>contrast).</b> In the research group of Danko Nikolić {{it has been shown that}} some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony. An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas. This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia.|$|E
500|$|To {{achieve the}} effect in which water {{appears to be}} flowing from subjects' mouths, each video has a segment where the subject's lips are puckered, which is then timed to {{correspond}} to the spouting water, reminiscent of gargoyle fountains. Each face is cropped so that no hair and usually no ears are visible. Since there is no tripod designed for cameras turned on their sides, an adjustable barber/dentist's chair was used to minimize {{the need for the}} movement of the state-of-the-art camera during filming. Nonetheless, in some case, digital manipulation was necessary to properly simulate puckering in the exact proper location on the video. [...] Many of the faces had to be stretched {{in order to get the}} mouths properly positioned. [...] Additionally, each video was color-corrected for <b>brightness,</b> <b>contrast</b> and color saturation. [...] Both the playback equipment and the final videos had to be further adjusted to account for sunlight during viewing.|$|E
500|$|In April 2012 Asus {{revealed}} {{a revision of}} the two original Zenbooks, this time based on the Ivy Bridge microarchitecture. The model numbers were UX21A and UX31A for the 11 and 13inch models respectively but are more frequently referred to as Zenbook Primes. Changes made to the original included the aforementioned update to Ivy Bridge processors {{and the introduction of}} the corresponding HM76 chipset bringing native USB 3.0, 1920×1080 IPS displays for both models, an Intel Centrino Wi-Fi controller, an improved trackpad and new plastic keyboard with backlighting. The new screens were highly praised by reviewers when considering <b>brightness,</b> <b>contrast</b> ratio, viewing angle and colour accuracy, the improvements over previous models being put down to the switch from TN to IPS displays. The UX21A has contrast ratio of 939 and the UX31A achieved 1085, giving it the highest resolution and contrast ratio of any ultrabook at the time of release. The improved keyboard also garnered praise for the increased backlighting and improved key travel while the Intel Wi-Fi controller was found to perform better than the Qualcomm used in the first generation of Zenbooks. The Zenbook Primes still received some criticism: the latest version of the trackpad was acknowledged as an improvement over the original Zenbooks, but still irritating, and the sound quality was found to be worse than that with the first generation. Despite these issues, the overall reaction was positive: the UX31A was called [...] "today's best ultrabook" [...] and [...] "the best ultrabook out there" [...] at the time of release.|$|E

First observed on May 20, 2005 by the Cassini spacecraft's Imaging Science Sub-system (ISS) camera (though seen obliquely during an early flyby), the features are most notable in lower resolution images by their <b>brightness</b> <b>contrast</b> from the surrounding terrain. [...] Higher resolution observations were obtained by Cassini's various instruments during a close flyby of Enceladus on July 14, 2005. [...] These observations revealed the tiger stripes to be low ridges with a central fracture. [...] Observations from the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) instrument showed the tiger stripes to have elevated surface temperatures, indicative of present-day cryovolcanism on Enceladus centered on the tiger stripes.|$|E

Legitimacy of support provided to farmers is monitored using the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), with land cover identification performed by visual image interpretation. While the geometric orthoimage quality required for correct interpretation is well understood, {{little is known about}} the photometric quality needed for LPIS applications. This paper analyzes the orthoimage quality characteristics chosen by authors as being most suitable for visual identification of agricultural fields. We designed a survey to assess users' preferred <b>brightness</b> and <b>contrast</b> ranges for orthoimages used for LPIS purposes. Survey questions also tested the influence of a background color on the preferred orthoimage <b>brightness</b> and <b>contrast,</b> the preferred orthoimage format and color composite, assessments of orthoimages with shadowed areas, appreciation of image enhancements and, finally, consistency of individuals' preferred <b>brightness</b> and <b>contrast</b> settings across multiple sample images. We find that image appreciation is stable at the individual level, but preferences vary across respondents. We therefore recommend that LPIS operators be enabled to personalize photometric settings, such as <b>brightness</b> and <b>contrast</b> values, and to choose the displayed band combination from at least four spectral bands. </p...|$|R
