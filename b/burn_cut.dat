Between 1978 and 1982, research was undertaken by Auburn University as to the effect of applications of chemical and physical irritants to the legs of Tennessee Walking Horses. The study found that chains of any weight used in combination with chemical soring produced lesions and pain in horses. However, chains of 6 ounces or lighter, used on their own, produced no pain, tissue damage or thermographic changes.|$|E

An investigation of the incident revealed that this anomaly was due to a fault in the main engine mixture-ratio supply valve, which restricted the flow of fuel to the engine.

50|$|Machines {{are commonplace}} in many industries, {{including}} manufacturing, mining, construction and agriculture, {{and can be}} dangerous to workers. Many machines involve moving parts, sharp edges, hot surfaces and other hazards {{with the potential to}} crush, <b>burn,</b> <b>cut,</b> shear, stab or otherwise strike or wound workers if used unsafely. Various safety measures exist to minimize these hazards, including lockout-tagout procedures for machine maintenance and roll over protection systems for vehicles. According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, machine-related injuries were responsible for 64,170 cases that required days away from work in 2008. More than a quarter of these cases required more than 31 days spent away from work. That same year, machines were the primary or secondary source of over 600 work-related fatalities. Machines are also often involved indirectly in worker deaths and injuries, such as in cases in which a worker slips and falls, possibly upon a sharp or pointed object. Power tools, used in many industries, present a number of hazards due to sharp moving parts, vibrations, or noise. The transportation sector bears many risks for the health of commercial drivers, too, for example from vibration, long periods of sitting, work stress and exhaustion. These problems occur in Europe but {{in other parts of the}} world the situation is even worse. More drivers die in accidents due to security defects in vehicles. Long waiting times at borders cause that drivers are away from home and family much longer and even increase the risk of HIV infections.|$|E

40|$|Drilling and {{blasting}} {{continues to}} be the predominant rock excavation technique in driving horizontal openings and tunnels for underground construction purpose. Faster drivages, attempted these days for reducing the long gestation periods of projects, have often resulted in large overbreak. This is due to the unacceptable levels of ground vibration to which the rock is subjected. Factors contributing to this include longer pulls; burn cuts, higher explosive per hole and per delay etc. Blast-induced rock damage (BIRD) assessment based on far-field peak particle velocity (PPV) measurement, when extrapolated near the face, has often resulted in suggesting higher PPV threshold levels. Apart from this the geological and structural features play a dominant role in masking the intensity of blast waves. Therefore, near-filed monitoring using accelerometers has been attempted in one of the metal mines to study the blast damage in faces excavated by <b>burn</b> <b>cut.</b> Present seismographs available have limited range (2540 mm/s) and are not suitable for near-field monitoring. This paper reports the investigations carried out for measuring acceleration, PPV and overbreak in a development heading for arriving at a suitable method of predicting blast-induced rock damage. The analysis of both acceleration and PPV measured against overbreak has revealed that rock damage is found to depend more on acceleration than PPV...|$|E
40|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{has increased}} fuel loads and fuel continuity in mixed-conifer ecosystems, resulting in forest structures that {{are vulnerable to}} catastrophic fire. This paper models fire behaviour in a mixed-conifer forest and investigates how silvicultural and fuels treatments affect potential fire behaviour. The computer program FARSITE was used to spatially and temporally model fire growth and behaviour. Fire modelling was performed in the North Crane Creek watershed of Yosemite National Park. Treatments were simulated by adjusting fuel (total load, load-by-size class, depth.) height-to-live crown base, tree height, and crown density parameters. Treatments modeled included prescribed burn, pile and <b>burn,</b> <b>cut</b> and scatter, thinning and biomass, thinning and biomass followed by prescribed burn, and salvage or group selection harvest with and without slash and landscape-level fuel treatment. The prescribed burn, thinning and biomassing followed by prescribed burn, and salvage or group selection with slash and landscape fuel treatments resulted in the lowest average fireline intensities, heat per unit area, rate of spread, area burned, and scorch heights. Cut and scatter, salvage or group selection treatments that do not treat slash fuels resulted in fire behaviour that is more extreme than the untreated forest. Restoration of mixed-conifer ecosystems must include an examination of how proposed treatments affect fuel structures. Combinations of prescribed fire and/or mechanical treatments {{can be used to}} reduce wildfire hazard...|$|E
