A work published by the Northampton County Historical and Genealogical Society in 1937, [...] "The Penn Patents in the Forks of the Delaware", contains a map called the [...] "Drylands Tract" [...] showing a semicolon-shaped pond at the point where five parcels deeded to (from northeast corner of pond moving clockwise) John Buss, Jacob Bunstein, George Hartzell, Frederick King et al., and Conrad Kocher. At the time of the property transfer, Fritts stated that the settlers found [...] "unbroken forest" [...] around what was then named [...] "Dry Lands Pond". This land, according to Fritts, [...] "was formerly known as the 'Dry Lands,' which were then thought to be so irreclaimably arid and barren, that they would never be fit for human habitation but which are now among the best lands of the county."

In the first activity students set up a plant transect, identify as many different types of vegetation as possible in the wetland, and compare upland and wetland species by observing differences in their structure. The objective of the second activity is to observe soil profiles and record wetland soil characteristics. Next, students record direct and indirect observations of wetland wildlife. If there is a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> at the site, students will investigate characteristics of water including velocity (for running water), temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and evidence of point and nonpoint source pollution in the water. Students next make an artist's inventory of the wetland by describing, illustrating, and photographing its shapes, colors, and sounds. In the final steps students observe and document any impacts that people have made to the wetland interior and boundaries and refine the measurements of the wetland base map. As they proceed, students should work together to assimilate the qualitative and quantitative information they have gathered in the field so it can be shared with others.

40|$|Fully-dynamic, {{continuous}} fugacity-based {{fate and}} transport {{models have been}} developed to examine all natural processes and interactions in the aquatic water systems. Within a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> such as a lake or a river, a dynamic interaction among different media takes place. Chemical compounds are continuously dissolving, adsorbing into solid particles, attaching to suspended particles, resuspending, reacting, diffusing, and advecting. As the inclusion of all these interactions into a model is complex, the use of fugacity concept instead of concentration, renders the modeling task relatively easy. Fugacity, which is described as the escaping tendency of a chemical from a medium, is continuous among different phases, thus easier to follow the movement of the chemical. The first model has been developed to be used as an emergency response model by decision makers, which models the fate and transport of any contaminant in a lake. Due to uncertainties involved in the analysis, Monte Carlo simulations are performed. The fate of three representative contaminants; polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), atrazine, and benzene in air, water, and sediment compartments are examined. The second model developed is a continuous, dynamic river fugacity-based water quality model. In order to develop a continuous model, the hydrodynamics of the river system is solved first. Water depth and velocity at each point along the river are used in the advection-dispersion equation to determine the fate and transport of a contaminant. Interactions between different phases are also incorporated into the advection-dispersion equation which is solved numerically and coupled with a mass balance equation derived for the same contaminant in the sediments. The third model is a multispecies contaminant fate and transport model which can be used for the fate of a single contaminant and its daughter products. Trichloroethylene (TCE) and its daughter products, dichloroethylene (DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC), are used as representative of multispecies contaminants. The fate and transport of TCE and its daughter products has been analyzed first in a lake environment, and then in a river environment {{with the addition of a}} biofilm compartment where all biotransformations take place.

The CAMI project has allowed the development of an integrated package based on geophysical and geochemical surveys and monitoring of the water basin, in the foothill areas of western Friuli-Venezia Giulia and the eastern Veneto region delimited by the Tagliamento, Meduna-Cellina and Livenza rivers. Through the CAMI project, it has been possible to apply different methodologies and to develop innovative and multi-disciplinary monitoring (geophysical, geochemical and hydrogeological) for the protection and enhancement of water resources {{at the level of the}} river basin, under Directive 2000 / 60 /EC. All the stakeholders can take advantage of both the results of the CAMI project as well as the technological and methodological innovations for the enhancement, monitoring and management of water resources of the subsoil. An important outcome of the project with respect to Directive 2000 / 60 /EC involved the possibility to rapidly characterise the groundwater resources at a low cost. In addition, the proposed and adopted methodologies can be applied to territories in which data from direct explorations (wells) is lacking; scarce information on the subsoil can be effectively complemented with geophysical investigations at a low cost and with no impact on the aquifers, in order to characterise potential deep water bodies. Minimizing direct investigations (wells) limits the possibility that pollutants will migrate from <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> towards deeper sources, as it is well known that wells may become avenues <b>of</b> contact between <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> and the underground...|$|R

50|$|Early {{telescopic}} astronomers, observing Mars from a {{great distance}} through primitive instruments (though they were advanced for their day), were limited to studying albedo contrasts on the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the planet. These lighter and darker patches rarely correspond to topographic features and in many cases obscure them. The origins of the albedo contrasts were a mystery. The lighter patches at the poles were correctly believed to be a frozen substance, either water or carbon dioxide, but the nature of the dark patches seen against the general reddish tint of Mars was uncertain for centuries. When Giovanni Schiaparelli began observing Mars in 1877, he believed that the darker features were seas, lakes, and swamps and named them accordingly in Latin (mare, lacus, palus etc.). Within a few decades, however, most astronomers came to agree that Mars lacks large <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> <b>water.</b> The dark features were then thought by some to be indications of Martian vegetation, since they changed shape and intensity {{over the course of the}} Martian year. They are now known to be areas where the wind has swept away the paler dust, exposing a darker surface, often basaltic rock; so their borders change in response to windstorms on the Martian surface that move the dust around, widening or narrowing the features.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect already {{produces}} elevated {{temperatures in}} city centres therefore urban design has {{a key role}} to pay in reducing the UHI to create safe and pleasant places in which to live and work. Increased <b>surface</b> porosity and <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> {{have a role to}} play in increasing potential cooling through evaporation. Urban rivers may, therefore, have a place in reducing the UHI. This paper investigates the effectiveness that small urban rivers may have in reducing the UHI effect and also examines the role that the urban form on the banks of a river can play in propagating or reducing this potential cooling. The results from a field survey during spring and summer are presented for a river in Sheffield, UK. The level of cooling is related to the ambient air temperature, increasing at higher temperatures. However, there are also seasonal dependencies and relationships linked to the river water temperature, incident solar radiation, wind speed and relative humidity. A mean level of daytime cooling of over 1. 5  °C was found above the river in spring, but this was reduced in summer when the river water temperature was warmer.

It assumes a homogeneous mixed water column driven by empirically derived fluxes. The model shows good agreement at both hourly and daily time scales with 10 -min temporal resolution observed water temperatures, monitored between June and November 2013 within a peri-urban area of Kumasi, Ghana. There {{was a close}} match between larvae development times calculated using either the model-derived or observed water temperatures. The water temperature scheme represents a significant improvement over assuming the water temperature to be equal to air temperature. The energy budget model requires observed minimum and maximum temperatures, information that is generally available from weather stations. Our results show that hourly variations in water temperature are important for the simulation of aquatic-stage development times. By contrast, we found that larval development is insensitive to sub-hourly variations. Modelling suggests {{that in addition to}} water temperature, accurate estimation of degree-day development time is very important to correctly predict the larvae development times.

The WFD Common Implementation Strategy (CIS) involves 25 EU member states, plus Bulgaria, Romania, Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland. The WFD aims at maintaining and improving the aquatic environment in the European Community and has set a target for member states to achieve ¿good ecological status¿ and ¿good <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> chemical status¿ in all <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> by 2015. Some water bodies may not achieve this objective. Under certain conditions water bodies can be designated Artificial Water Bodies (AWB, e. g., reservoirs) or Heavily Modified Water Bodies (HMWB) if they cannot meet the ¿good ecological status¿ because of physical alterations by human activity that have substantially changed their character. Instead of ¿good ecological status¿, the ¿good ecological potential¿ (GEP) has to be achieved for HMWB and for AWB by 2015. The assignment of less stringent objectives to water bodies and an extension of the timing for achieving the objectives are also possible when justifiable ¿ for example. if the cost of possible measures is too high in comparison to the degree of ecosystem recovery. The WFD will fundamentally change how water is monitored, assessed, and managed in Europe.

All continental regions show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania, which has a fractional (one per cent) net loss. Much of the increase is from reservoir filling, although climate change is also implicated. Loss is more geographically concentrated than gain. Over 70 percent of global net permanent water loss occurred in the Middle East and Central Asia, linked to drought and human actions including river diversion or damming and unregulated withdrawal. Losses in Australia 17 and the USA 18 linked to long-term droughts are also evident.

40|$|The atmospheres of the {{terrestrial}} planets are generally {{supposed to have}} been formed by secondary degassing processes. It is proposed instead, in this thesis, that the atmospheres formed as a necessary consequence of the final stages of planetary accretion. When the planetary embryos reached a critical size, the accretional material impacting the surface began to vaporize and some remained in this gaseous state. As the gases accumulated, further incoming material was decelerated, thus limiting the rate of atmosphere growth. When reasonable assumptions are made, concerning the nature of the impacting material, an acceptable model for the early terrestrial atmospheres results. Our knowledge of the noble gas abundances for the present Martian and terrestrial atmospheres does not preclude the possibility of atmosphere production from the impact of mainly primitive Cl meteorite type material. Subsequent development of these primitive atmospheres into those which currently exist is possible. The evolution of the Earth's atmosphere is discussed in detail, with emphasis {{on the development of the}} carbon dioxide cycle.

The semi-arid climate is characterized by the fact that evaporation often exceeds precipitation. Most of the vegetation in these areas is arid grassland with desert plants such as nopal. These climates cover about forty percent of the state, mostly in the north. Semi-arid temperate regions are found in the municipalities of San Felipe, San Diego de la Unión, San Luis de la Paz, part of Dolores Hidalgo and San José de Iturbide, where precipitation varies between 400 and 500 mm and the average temperature is between 16 and 18 °C. Semi-arid semi hot climates can be found north of Dolores Hidalgo, around León and in areas near Celaya. In these municipalities, rainfall averages between 600 and 700 mm and the average annual temperature is between 18 and 20 °C. Temperate climates are judged by the presence of holm oak and pine forest, pine forests and/or pine forests with meadows. Humidity varies in these forest regions. Temperate semi-moist areas are mostly found in the southeast municipalities of Apaseo, Coroneo and Jerécuaro and in the center of the state. Precipitation varies from 600 to 700 mm and the average temperature is between 16 and 18 °C. Temperate and somewhat humid climates have rainfall averages of between 700 and 800 mm, with temperatures between 16 and 18 °C. These can be found in Pénjamo, Coroneo, Jerécuaro and parts of Guanajuato (municipality) and Dolores Hidalgo. Temperate climates with the most humidity are found in the Santa Rosa and municipality of Guanajuato. These have rainfall averages of over 800 mm and average temperatures of under 16 °C. Hot and moist climates in the state have temperatures ranging from 18 to 22 °C and are associated with tropical rainforest, with some grassland. These climates are subdivided into two types, one that receives less rainfall with a significant dry season and the other which is wetter. The drier type is found in Abasolo, Irapuato, Salamanca and Romita. In total, these hot and relatively moist climates can be found in about 40% of the state.|$|R

The images of c 1 orofila it showed the enrichment <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> <b>water,</b> especially the equatorial divergence and retroflexion of the North Brazil Current. The study of three species of tuna (Yellowfin Lage, White and mandolinist), caught in the area between 15 Â N - 15 Â S and 500 W - 15 Â W through the analysis of time series, showed that the catch per unit of effort (CPUE) for Albacora Lage tend White and non-estacionaridade while mandolinist Albacora tended to estacionaridade. The differences between the monthly and annual CPUES of the three species were studied through the use of models of analysis of variance, with relations between the CPUEs and the environmental variables listed above, were correlated, allowing the fit of simple linear models and multiple, and in some cases was applied logarithmic transformation in the value of variables...|$|R
50|$|Gerridae species {{use this}} surface tension to their {{advantage}} through their highly adapted legs and distributed weight. The legs of a water strider are long and slender, allowing {{the weight of the}} water strider body to be distributed over a large surface area. The legs are strong, but have flexibility that allows the water striders to keep their weight evenly distributed and flow with the water movement. Hydrofuge hairs line the <b>body</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> strider. There are several thousand hairs per square millimeter, providing the water strider with a hydrofuge body that prevents wetting from waves, rain, or spray, which could inhibit their ability to keep their entire body above the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> if the <b>water</b> stuck and weighed down the <b>body.</b> This position <b>of</b> keeping the majority <b>of</b> the <b>body</b> above the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> is called an epipleustonic position, which is a defining characteristic of water striders. If the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the water strider were to accidentally become submerged, for instance by a large wave, the tiny hairs would trap air. Tiny air bubbles throughout the body act as buoyancy to bring the water strider to the surface again, while also providing air bubbles to breathe from underwater.|$|R

This environmental problems and frequent have become increasingly critical, since as can reach the soil, air and <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> and underground <b>water.</b> Besides that, contain compounds with high level of toxicity, mobility and persistence in the environment, and generate a major ecological impact, these pollutants hinder the treatment of contaminated areas. The objective this work is to analyze from the law involved in the prevention of environmental damage this work also sought to introduce control measures and repair of the impacts caused by the oil industry, with emphasis on bioremediation technology as a mitigation measure, working in the recovery of degraded areas. Several studies developed in Brazil and the world has shown good results in restoring environments that have been polluted by hydrocarbons. It was also demonstrated the importance of the choice of technique bioremediation that followed the most used techniques for the biodegradation of hydrocarbons, both in situ and ex situ, as well as the processes involved for the bioremediation occurs effectively and safely. The development of studies like this can help generate new technologies or improve those that already exist, which is fundamental for the enrichment of new environmental decontamination projects...|$|R
40|$|Drainage {{water from}} an {{abandoned}} galena mine {{is currently being}} used for livestock, a fish hatchery and irrigation of agricultural crops in Payson, Utah. The drainage water also feeds a losing stream very near to springs that are used for drinking water for local residences. The drainage water flows year round and could potentially be contaminating a large <b>body</b> <b>of</b> groundwater and <b>surface</b> <b>water.</b> The goal <b>of</b> this research {{was to determine whether}} the mine drainage water has levels of lead, copper and silver exceeding the State of Utah Groundwater Standards, which are 0. 015 mg/L for lead, 0. 1 mg/L for silver and 1. 3 mg/L for copper. Water samples were collected from 15 locations, including the mine, a pipeline fed by the drainage water, and the losing stream fed by the drainage water. All sample bottles were rinsed with nitric acid to prevent contamination from the bottle. Sample bottles for lead analysis included an acid preservative agent to prevent adsorption of lead onto the bottle. All samples were analyzed using the Hach DR- 2700 Spectrophotometer. No samples had silver or copper levels exceeding Utah standards. However, six out of 15 samples exceeded the Utah standard for lead with average lead concentration Pb = 0. 033 mg/L. The maximum lead concentration, found in water flowing over the mine tailings, was Pb = 0. 148 mg/L, nearly ten times the Utah standard. Options for remediation have been presented to landowners and at least one will be implemented beginning the summer of 2012. Water samples from drainage water destinations will be re-analyzed following remediation...|$|R
