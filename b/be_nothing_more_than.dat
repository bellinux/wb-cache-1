Rangers head coach John Muckler publicly declared {{before the beginning of}} Malhotra's second NHL campaign that he would <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a career third-liner. Malhotra's potential was often at the centre of an ongoing dispute between Muckler and Smith.|$|E
5|$|Gladiators {{were trained}} combatants {{who might be}} slaves, convicts, or free volunteers. Death was not a {{necessary}} or even desirable outcome in matches between these highly skilled fighters, whose training represented a costly and time-consuming investment. By contrast, noxii were convicts sentenced to the arena {{with little or no}} training, often unarmed, and with no expectation of survival. Physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate retributive justice for the crimes they had committed. These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as re-enactments of myths, and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate stage machinery to create special effects. Tertullian considered deaths in the arena to <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a dressed-up form of human sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|Production {{began on}} 18 September 1967 {{with a budget}} of £83,000. Thirty-two {{thousand}} pounds was provided by AIP, with £12,000 for Price's expenditures and fees, and £20,000 for production costs. Philip Waddilove, a former BBC radio and record producer, contributed £5,000 in return for associate producer billing. Although the film would be the biggest budgeted title in Tigon's history, for AIP their part of the budget represented a relatively small expenditure of money. Not much in terms of real quality was expected by AIP heads Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson, and the movie was intended to <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a tax write-off.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, the Roman Kingdom {{was founded}} in 753 BC, and was ruled by a {{succession}} of seven kings. The last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, ruled in a tyrannical manner and, in 510 BC, his son Sextus Tarquinius raped a noblewoman named Lucretia. Lucretia, {{the wife of a}} senator named Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, committed suicide because of the rape, and this led to a conspiracy which drove Tarquin from the city. With Tarquin's expulsion, the Roman Republic was founded, and the chief conspirators, Collatinus and the senator Lucius Junius Brutus, were elected as the first Roman Consul (chief-executive). While this story may <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a legend which later Romans created in order to explain their past, it is likely that Rome had been ruled by a series of kings, who probably were, as the legends suggest, overthrown quickly.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgerald's {{goal was}} to produce a {{literary}} work which would truly prove himself as a writer, and Gatsby {{did not have the}} commercial success of his two previous novels, This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned. Although the novel went through two initial printings, some of these copies remained unsold years later. Fitzgerald himself blamed poor sales on the fact that women tended to be the main audience for novels during this time, and Gatsby did not contain an admirable female character. According to his own ledger, now made available online by University of South Carolina's Thomas Cooper library, he earned only $2,000 from the book. Although 1926 brought Owen Davis's stage adaption and the Paramount-issued silent film version, both of which brought in money for the author, Fitzgerald still felt the novel fell short of the recognition he hoped for and, most importantly, would not propel him to becoming a serious novelist in the public eye. For several years afterward, the general public believed The Great Gatsby to <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a nostalgic period piece.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan was}} {{immediately}} criticized by Prime Minister Harper, who {{described it as}} a tax grab and compared it to the National Energy Program that the federal Liberal government adopted in the 1980s.

Layton further noted that Dion's proposal does not set a target for reducing emissions.|$|E

25|$|These {{important}} scientific {{findings may}} begin to shift the neuron-specific perspective into a more holistic view of the brain which encompasses the glial cells as well. The glia's importance is becoming ever more clear {{as time goes on}} and new research is conducted. For the vast part of the last century, scientists have written off glial cells to <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the structure and foundations that hold the neurons in place. But now, there is direct evidence that correlates the number of glial cells in the brain with the amount of intelligence that any given species possesses. Future research will begin to shed light on the mysterious, yet increasingly crucial, role of glial cells.|$|E
25|$|More {{surprising}} was {{the analysis}} of the rat-poison paste; it turned out to <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a mixture of flour, water and soda. This led to the possibility that Marie used the real arsenic to murder her husband. Any remaining doubts that may have lingered vanished when Emma Pontier turned over the small malachite box, and Dr. Lespinasse found it to contain arsenic. Marie was arrested and held in jail in Brive. A young French lawyer, Charles Lachaud, was appointed to her defence and was assisted by three others, Maîtres Théodore Bac (who later became mayor of Limoges during the 1848 Revolution), Paillet, and Desmont. Before they began their work, there was another surprise in store. The newspaper stories regarding Marie Lafarge turned up something from her past.|$|E

25|$|The {{news that}} Louis XIV had {{accepted}} Charles II's will {{and that the}} Second Partition Treaty was dead was a personal blow to William III, who had concluded that Philip V would <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a French puppet. However, in England many argued that the acceptance of Charles II's will was preferable to a treaty that would have extended French territory, including the addition of Naples and Sicily, which under French control would {{pose a threat to}} England's Levantine trade. After the exertions of the Nine Years' War the Tory-dominated House of Commons was keen to prevent further conflict and restore normal commercial activity. Yet to William III, France's growing strength made war inevitable, and together with Anthonie Heinsius, Grand Pensionary of Holland and de facto executive head of the Dutch state once William had been crowned King of England in 1689, he made preparations to gain support. To this end, William III was aided by Louis XIV's own actions, which fatally compromised the position of advantage the French king held.|$|E

The New York Times writer Ashley Dunn characterized the game's E3 demonstration as [...] "brain-dead" [...] in its gameplay and suggested that even young children would rather fly a dragon on the Sony PlayStation. Game Revolution issued Pilotwings 64 a particularly harsh review score, declaring the game to <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a graphical showcase for those with nothing better to do. The sound effects present in the game were impressive to several reviewers, but the soundtrack has been negatively compared to lounge music and porn groove, although the 'Birdman' track was highly rated.|$|E
