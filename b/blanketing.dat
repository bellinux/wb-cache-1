5|$|The second eruptive period, the Cougar Stage, started 20,000 {{years ago}} and lasted for 2,000 years. Pyroclastic flows of hot pumice and ash along with dome growth {{occurred}} during this period. Another 5,000 years of dormancy followed, only to be upset {{by the beginning of}} the Swift Creek eruptive period, typified by pyroclastic flows, dome growth and <b>blanketing</b> of the countryside with tephra. Swift Creek ended 8,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{worked with}} Alan Splet {{to design the}} film's sound. The pair {{arranged}} and fabricated soundproof <b>blanketing</b> to insulate their studio, where they spent almost a year creating and editing the film's sound effects. The soundtrack is densely layered, including as many as fifteen different sounds played simultaneously using multiple reels. Sounds were created {{in a variety of}} ways—for a scene in which a bed slowly dissolves into a pool of liquid, Lynch and Splet inserted a microphone inside a plastic bottle, floated it in a bathtub, and recorded the sound of air blown through the bottle. After being recorded, sounds were further augmented by alterations to their pitch, reverb and frequency.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of the abyssal plain {{is the result of}} the spreading of the seafloor (plate tectonics) and the melting of the lower oceanic crust. Magma rises from above the asthenosphere (a layer of the upper mantle), and as this basaltic material reaches the surface at mid-ocean ridges, it forms new oceanic crust, which is constantly pulled sideways by spreading of the seafloor. Abyssal plains result from the <b>blanketing</b> of an originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt. Much of this sediment is deposited by turbidity currents that have been channelled from the continental margins along submarine canyons into deeper water. The rest is composed chiefly of pelagic sediments. Metallic nodules are common in some areas of the plains, with varying concentrations of metals, including manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper.|$|E

50|$|To <b>blanket</b> train a child, a {{caretaker}} places the infant or toddler on a <b>blanket</b> and punishes the child {{when he or}} she attempts to leave the <b>blanket.</b> Proponents of <b>blanket</b> training believe that eventually the child will stay on the <b>blanket</b> without adult intervention or enforcement because the child has come to associate leaving the <b>blanket</b> with pain.|$|R
50|$|Navajo tribes used special {{indigo dye}} from Mexico and other vegetal dyes to color {{multi-ply}} yarns and weave them into three main types of <b>blankets</b> - a serape (a shoulder covering <b>blanket</b> that {{is longer than}} it is wide), a saddle <b>blanket</b> (a <b>blanket</b> that was folded in half under a horse’s saddle for extra cushioning), and a chief's <b>blanket</b> (a shoulder <b>blanket</b> that was made wider than it was long).|$|R
5|$|The flat {{appearance}} of mature abyssal plains {{results from the}} <b>blanketing</b> of this originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt. Much of this sediment is deposited from turbidity currents that have been channeled from the continental margins along submarine canyons down into deeper water. The remainder of the sediment comprises chiefly dust (clay particles) blown out to sea from land, {{and the remains of}} small marine plants and animals which sink from the upper layer of the ocean, known as pelagic sediments. The total sediment deposition rate in remote areas is estimated at two to three centimeters per thousand years. Sediment-covered abyssal plains are less common in the Pacific Ocean than in other major ocean basins because sediments from turbidity currents are trapped in oceanic trenches that border the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The town is sited on {{the hills}} {{adjoining}} the flood plain of the River Nene. In the predominantly agrarian medieval period, this combination of access to fertile, if flood-prone, valley bottom soils and drier (but heavier and more clay-rich) hillside/ hilltop soils {{seems to have been}} good for a mixed agricultural base. The clay-rich hilltop soils are primarily a consequence of <b>blanketing</b> of the area with boulder clay or glacial till during the recent glaciations. On the valley sides and valley floor however, these deposits have been largely washed away in the late glacial period, and in the valley bottom extensive deposits of gravels were laid down, which have largely been exploited for building aggregate in the last century.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{lived in}} a vast {{floodplain}} along the western shore of the interior seaway. Large rivers watered the land, occasionally flooding and <b>blanketing</b> the region with new sediment. When water was plentiful, the region could support {{a great deal of}} plant and animal life, but periodic droughts also struck the region, resulting in mass mortality as preserved in the many bonebed deposits found in Two Medicine and Judith River sediments, including the Daspletosaurus bonebed. Similar conditions exist today in East Africa. Volcanic eruptions from the west periodically blanketed the region with ash, also resulting in large-scale mortality, while simultaneously enriching the soil for future plant growth. It is these ash beds that allow precise radiometric dating as well. Fluctuating sea levels also resulted in a variety of other environments at different times and places within the Judith River Group, including offshore and nearshore marine habitats, coastal wetlands, deltas and lagoons, in addition to the inland floodplains. The Two Medicine Formation was deposited at higher elevations farther inland than the other two formations.|$|E

50|$|The {{misconception}} persists {{that originally}} the points were {{an indication of}} the <b>blanket</b> price in beaver pelts or even its weight. Thickness and quality are the same <b>blanket</b> to <b>blanket,</b> and a larger <b>blanket</b> will naturally weigh more.|$|R
50|$|The family resumed the {{production}} of Native-American <b>blankets</b> and introduced new designs, colors, and patterns to their product line. They also changed {{the construction of the}} mill's Native-American <b>blankets.</b> Prior to 1909 the <b>blankets</b> had round corners. The Bishop <b>blankets</b> featured square corners. Pendleton round corner <b>blankets</b> are highly coveted by vintage Native-American <b>blanket</b> collectors. The company expanded their trade from the local Native-American tribes of the Columbia River area, to the Navajo, Hopi, and Zuni peoples of the American Southwest. To do this, they enlisted the help of designer Joe Rawnsley, who visited tribes to learn their customs and color preferences. Like many other mills of the day, Pendleton emulated the multicolor patterns of candy-stripe <b>blankets,</b> like those found on Hudson's Bay point <b>blankets,</b> for their Glacier National Park <b>blanket.</b> The Pendleton <b>blankets</b> were not only basic wearing apparel, but were standards of trading and ceremonial use.|$|R
5|$|Reconstructions of the {{eruption}} {{and its effects}} vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted two days. The morning {{of the first day}} was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger. In {{the middle of the day}} an explosion threw up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, <b>blanketing</b> the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day pyroclastic surges in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights were seen on the peak interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples. By late afternoon of the second day, {{the eruption}} was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{building}} an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area {{was a significant}} issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic nuclear meltdown <b>blanketing</b> one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even {{in the event of}} a runaway reaction. When a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction. The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind fission products that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction like the one in a pile where the fission products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total neutron flux.|$|E
5|$|With Ujung Kulon as {{the last}} resort of this species, all the Javan rhinos are in one location, an {{advantage}} over the Sumatran rhino which is dispersed in different, unconnected areas. However, this may also be disadvantageous to the Javan rhino population, because any catastrophic diseases or tsunamis could wipe them all out at once. Poaching for their horns is no longer as serious a threat as in the past, due to stricter international regulations on rhino horn, active protection efforts by local authorities, the rhinos' elusiveness and Ujung Kulon's remoteness. However, there are still obstacles to the species recovery. In 2012, the Asian Rhino Project was working out the best eradication programme for the arenga palm, which was <b>blanketing</b> the park and crowding out the rhinos' food sources. The banteng cattle also compete with the rhinos for food, so the authorities were considering plans to fence off {{the western part of}} the park to keep the livestock out.|$|E

5|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as Leader of a Machine-gun Section of Company B, First Battalion, Twenty-Third Marines, Fourth Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces during the assault on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Assailed by a tremendous volume of small-arms, mortar and artillery fire as he advanced with one squad of his section in the initial assault wave, Sergeant Cole boldly led his men up the sloping beach toward Airfield Number One despite the <b>blanketing</b> curtain of flying shrapnel and, personally destroying with hand grenades two hostile emplacements which menaced the progress of his unit, continued to move forward until a merciless barrage of fire emanating from three Japanese pillboxes halted the advance. Instantly placing his one remaining machine gun in action, he delivered a shattering fusillade and succeeded in silencing the nearest and most threatening emplacement before his weapon jammed and the enemy, reopening fire with knee mortars and grenades, pinned down his unit for the second time. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation and evolving a daring plan of counterattack, Sergeant Cole, armed solely with a pistol and one grenade, coolly advanced alone to the hostile pillboxes. Hurling his one grenade at the enemy in sudden, swift attack, he quickly withdrew, returned to his own lines for additional grenades and again advanced, attacked, and withdrew. With enemy guns still active, he ran the gauntlet of slashing fire a third time to complete the total destruction of the Japanese strong point and the annihilation of the defending garrison in this final assault. Although instantly killed by an enemy grenade as he returned to his squad, Sergeant Cole had eliminated a formidable Japanese position, thereby enabling his company to storm the remaining fortifications, continue the advance and seize the objective. By his dauntless initiative, unfaltering courage and indomitable determination during a critical period of action, Sergeant Cole served as an inspiration to his comrades, and his stouthearted leadership in the face of almost certain death sustained and enhanced the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E

40|$|In fusion reactors, the <b>blanket</b> {{design and}} its {{characteristics}} {{have a major}} impact on the reactor performance, size, and economics. The selection and arrangement of the <b>blanket</b> materials, dimensions of the different <b>blanket</b> zones, and different requirements of the selected materials for a satisfactory performance are the main parameters, which define the <b>blanket</b> performance. These parameters translate to a large number of variables and design constraints, which need to be simultaneously considered in the <b>blanket</b> design process. This represents a major design challenge because of the lack of a comprehensive design tool capable of considering all these variables to define the optimum <b>blanket</b> design and satisfying all the design constraints for the adopted figure of merit and the <b>blanket</b> design criteria. The <b>blanket</b> design techniques of the First Wall/Blanket/Shield Design and Optimization System (BSDOS) have been developed to overcome this difficulty and to provide the state-of-the-art techniques and tools for performing <b>blanket</b> design and analysis. This report describes some of the BSDOS techniques and demonstrates its use. In addition, the use of the optimization technique of the BSDOS can result in a significant <b>blanket</b> performance enhancement and cost saving for the reactor design under consideration.

25|$|This general {{conclusion}} {{seems to be}} supported in the Borealis region by the relative scarcity of craters between 30 km and 60 km in diameter. This scarcity may indicate resurfacing by crater overlap and <b>blanketing</b> by crater ejecta or resurfacing by lava flows. Craters ≥60 km in diameter on Mercury also are relatively scarce compared to similar craters in the lunar uplands northwest of crater Tsiolkovskiy. The reduced density of large craters and basins on Mercury relative to the Moon could be either a function of different crater-population rates on these bodies or an effect of different crustal histories (Schaber and others, 1977).|$|E
25|$|In the smelt water {{explosion}} {{even a few}} {{liters of}} water, when mixed with molten smelt can violently turn to steam in few tenths of a second.

25|$|The {{capacity}} of the DM plant is dictated by the type and quantity of salts in the raw water input. However, some storage is essential as the DM plant may be down for maintenance. For this purpose, a storage tank is installed from which DM water is continuously withdrawn for boiler make-up. The storage tank for DM water is made from materials not affected by corrosive water, such as PVC. The piping and valves are generally of stainless steel. Sometimes, a steam <b>blanketing</b> arrangement or stainless steel doughnut float is provided {{on top of the}} water in the tank to avoid contact with air. DM water make-up is generally added at the steam space of the surface condenser (i.e., the vacuum side). This arrangement not only sprays the water but also DM water gets deaerated, with the dissolved gases being removed by a de-aerator through an ejector attached to the condenser.|$|E
25|$|To raise revenue, Congress {{significantly}} raised {{tariffs on}} tea and coffee. Profits on these products declined; around 1880 A started to sell sugar in its stores. The company continued aggressive growth and by 1884 operated stores as far west as Kansas City {{and as far}} south as Atlanta. The company also operated wagon routes to serve rural customers. About this time, two of Hartford's sons, George (1864–1957) and John (1872–1951), joined the firm. A lore is that George convinced his father to expand the product line to include A baking powder. Over the next decade, the company added other A products, such as condensed milk, spices, and butter. As it expanded its offerings, the tea company was gradually creating the first grocery chain. By 1900, the firm had sales of $5 million from 198 stores as well as its mail order and wagon route operations.
