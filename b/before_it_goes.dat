5|$|A {{party is}} {{held for the}} team, and Dax and Kahn warm to one another's company once more. Afterward, they begin to socialize as they work {{together}} on Kahn's wormhole experiment aboard USS Defiant. They agree to have dinner, but to also bring Bashir along as a chaperone. At the dinner, Bashir feels out of place and is effectively ignored by the two Trills. Returning to the tests, Kahn creates the first artificial wormhole in history and Dax hugs her in celebration. Kahn's brother Bejal (Tim Ryan), {{who is on the}} science team, speaks to her separately and highlights his concerns regarding her contact with Dax. Despite this, Kahn goes to Dax's quarters and a discussion between the two leads to a kiss; Kahn leaves <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> any further.|$|E
5|$|Following US 30, Route 73 {{passes through}} a small corner of Berlin Boro <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> under New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line near the Atco station. At the {{railroad}} crossing, the route enters Berlin Township and meets CR 534 at a crossroad. After the intersection with this route, the road proceeds back into Berlin Boro, where the route runs through a mix of residences and businesses. Route 73 widens to a six-lane highway and comes to the former Berlin Circle, where it meets both CR 689 and CR 708. From here, the road turns north and reenters Berlin Township as a four-lane divided highway, continuing through developed areas and intersecting CR 692. Prior to the junction with CR 693, the route enters Voorhees Township, where it encounters CR 675.|$|E
25|$|As {{the city}} is located on a plain in the Sonoran Desert, {{surrounded}} by flat areas with grass, behind which are greener hills that are then framed by serrated peaks in the background, {{the city is}} a common stopover for North Americans traveling by car toward the coast, {{and is the only}} city in Mexico that purifies all drinking water <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> to homes. The city is the major economic center for the state, with about thirty percent of the state's population living in the city.|$|E

25|$|Precordial {{monitoring}} of the pulmonary artery is the usual monitoring site, as it combines all the blood returning to the body <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> to the lungs, so it is least likely to miss bubbles from a peripheral source, and is most compatible with the Spencer and K-M scales, as heart sounds are clearly audible. Other sites which have been used include the subclavian vein, carotid artery, femoral vein and inferior vena cava. Protocols for ultrasonic investigation of decompression bubbles are still in development, and may vary between researchers.|$|E
25|$|Once {{approved}} by Congress, the joint resolution proposing {{a constitutional amendment}} does not require Presidential approval <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> out to the states. While Article I Section 7 provides that all federal legislation must, before becoming Law, {{be presented to the}} President for his or her signature or veto, Article V provides no such requirement for constitutional amendments {{approved by}} Congress, or by a federal convention. Thus the president has no official function in the process. In Hollingsworth v. Virginia (1798), the Supreme Court affirmed that {{it is not necessary to}} place constitutional amendments before the President for approval or veto.|$|E

500|$|In one ending, Junpei {{learns that}} the first Nonary Game was run by Cradle Pharmaceutical, of which Ace is the CEO. Zero was a {{participant}} of this game, and had set up the second Nonary Game as revenge towards Ace. The surviving players confront Ace and learn he manipulated the 9th Man to violate the rules and get himself killed in order to both cover his identity and obtain the 9th Man's bracelet. As they find {{the door with the}} 9, Akane becomes weak. Santa watches over her while the others enter the door, leading to an incinerator, where Ace grabs Lotus and holds her at gunpoint. Discovering the incinerator is about to activate, Snake tackles Ace, and Lotus and Seven pull Junpei out of the incinerator <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> off, consuming Snake and Ace. Junpei returns to Akane, finding her nearly dead. Zero says over the loudspeakers that the game's loser has been determined; Junpei acts defiant, but Zero clarifies that he is referring to himself. Junpei investigates a nearby room, and returns to find Akane and Santa have disappeared, after which he is knocked out by a gas grenade. After the player views this ending, they can then access the ultimate or [...] "true" [...] ending.|$|E
2500|$|The protein RPE65 {{is used in}} the retinoid cycle {{where the}} all-trans-retinol within the [...] rod outer segment is isomerized to its 11-cis form and {{oxidized}} to 11-cis retinal <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> back to the photoreceptor [...] and joins with opsin molecule to form functional rhodopsin. [...] In animal knockout model (RPE65-/-), gene transfer experiment shows that early intraocular delivery of human RPE65 vector on embryonic day 14 shows efficient transduction of retinal pigment epithelium in the RPE65-/- [...] knockout mice and rescues visual functions. This shows successful gene therapy can be attributed to early intraocular deliver to the diseased animal.|$|E
2500|$|In 1936, Goldmann and Reform Rabbi Stephen S. Wise {{established}} the World Jewish Congress (WJC). He {{is credited with}} the early prediction of {{the threat posed by}} Hitler and Nazi Party. In the spring of 1942, he said, [...] "Who can foretell what the Nazi regime, once brought into the position of the surrounded killer, will do in the last moment <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> down to shame?" [...] Addressing the Zionist Organization of America in October 1942, having heard the reports of genocide, he lamented, [...] "Our generation is in the tragic position that one-half of the generation is being slaughtered before our eyes, and the other half has to sit down and cannot prevent this catastrophe." [...] Goldmann took up residence in the United States in June 1940, eventually took out citizenship, and remained there until 1964.|$|E

2500|$|The United States Department of Justice filed {{a lawsuit}} against the state of Arizona in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona on July 6, 2010, asking that the law be {{declared}} invalid since it interferes with the immigration regulations [...] "exclusively vested in the federal government." [...] In a brief to the press, the department's lawyers referenced the notion of federal preemption and stated that, [...] "The Constitution and the federal immigration laws do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country," [...] and that [...] "The immigration framework set forth by Congress and administered by federal agencies reflects a careful and considered balance of national law enforcement, foreign relations, and humanitarian concerns – concerns that belong to the nation as a whole, not a single state." [...] This pointed to an additional practical argument, that being that the law would result in federal authorities losing focus on their broader priorities {{in order to deal with}} an influx of deportations from Arizona. [...] The Justice Department requested that the federal courts issue an injunction to enjoin enforcement of the law <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> into effect. [...] The suit does not argue that the law will lead to racial profiling, although department officials said they would continue to monitor that aspect when and if the measure went into effect.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the highway}} enters the Great Plains, {{specifically}} the northern High Plains, the first town it encounters is Browning, the largest settlement on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. From {{here to the}} North Dakota border, the area surrounding to the highway is known as [...] "The Hi-Line" [...] to Montanans from the early Great Northern Railway route. The Hi-Line (also spelled Highline and Hiline) is one of around 50 folk regions in Montana. [...] It next travels through Cut Bank and Shelby, where it meets Interstate 15 and becomes the northern border of the area known as the [...] "Golden Triangle," [...] another folk region, in Montana. This area {{is one of the}} most agriculturally productive in the country. From Shelby it hits a string of small towns <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> on to Havre, near the geographical center of the road in the state and the other northern apex of the Golden Triangle. Just south of Havre and off the highway about fifteen miles (24km) is the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation. The highway continues east to Malta, before which it travels through the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. From Malta, the highway continues on to Glasgow, just north of Fort Peck Dam, and then into the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. The highway stays within the reservation for much of its remaining length through Montana. On the reservation it travels through Wolf Point and Poplar, and then exits the reservation a short distance before leaving the state. The final town of Bainville is the last major town on the highway as it leaves the state, near the confluence of the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers.|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Chris Roper was {{impressed}} with New York City, praising [...] "how well your general duties as a cop are tied into the game, working very well alongside your own personal investigations," [...] and finding the gameplay and game mechanics superior to Streets of LA. Eurogamer's Jim Rossignol was critical of the AI; [...] "the perps you take down never suggest that they are anything other than mindless automata ready to be slain, and exhibit an artificiality that could never be described as 'intelligence'." [...] GameSpy's Sterling McGarvey wrote [...] "Luxoflux have turned a slightly above-par GTA clone into a sub-par franchise." [...] Of the graphics, he wrote, [...] "the frame rate {{has a knack for}} chugging. Considering it's a console and not a five year-old PC running this game, it's unacceptable. Out of nowhere, the frame rate will completely bottom out while Marcus patrols the streets." [...] He called the game [...] "unfinished." [...] GameSpot's Greg Mueller accused the game of being [...] "so riddled with problems that it feels like it was rushed to make it to store shelves in time for the holidays. He cited [...] "collision detection issues and edge detection problems that cause you to get stuck {{on the edge of a}} platform. [...] the game will actually freeze up entirely from time to time [...] There are also some pretty ugly clipping issues here too." [...] He concluded [...] "the technical problems far outweigh any faint hope this game ever had of being enjoyable. If you're curious about what a video game looks like <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> through adequate testing and quality assurance, then by all means give this one a try." ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Greg Mueller was {{extremely}} unimpressed, scoring the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions 4.6 out of 10, and the Xbox version 4.3 out of 10. He accused {{the game of}} being [...] "so riddled with problems that {{it feels like it}} was rushed to make it to store shelves in time for the holidays." [...] He cited [...] "bugs that will make you randomly fall through the ground into a bunch of nothingness, bugs that make textures change when you {{get in and out of}} a car, bugs that cause you to inadvertently break a scripted sequence, thus making it impossible to complete a mission. There are also collision detection issues and edge detection problems that cause you to get stuck on the edge of a platform. That's not all--the game will actually freeze up entirely from time to time [...] There are also some pretty ugly clipping issues here too." [...] He concluded [...] "True Crime: New York City should be avoided regardless of whether or not you enjoyed the first True Crime. The gameplay has a few almost-decent spots, but the technical problems far outweigh any faint hope this game ever had of being enjoyable. If you're curious about what a video game looks like <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> through adequate testing and quality assurance, then by all means give this one a try." [...] He scored the PC version 5.2 out of 10, writing, [...] "while it manages to address some of the more egregious glitches that appeared in the console versions of the game, it still doesn't feel like a finished product." ...|$|E
