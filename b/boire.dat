500|$|The {{success of}} the games revived the {{popularity}} of the Pokémon brand. George Harrison, then Nintendo of America's vice president of marketing, noted that the games were attracting [...] "players of all ages"—from younger children to [...] "grown men and women" [...] and older players who [...] "played the original Pokémon games". As a result, Pokémon USA opened a temporary boutique in the Times Square Toys [...] "R" [...] Us that sold exclusively Pokémon licensed merchandise including Jakks Pacific-created action figures, plush toys, backpacks, and clothing. Ronald <b>Boire,</b> president of Toys [...] "R" [...] Us, stated that the store planned to open temporary boutiques in all 585 of its domestic locations. Other Pokémon merchandise includes a BattleDome Playset and a talking Pokédex. Additionally, Pokémon USA partnered with Burger King in 2008 to launch a promotional campaign in which Burger King included exclusive Pokémon trading cards and accessories with Kids Meals. The promotion lasted from July 7 to August 3 in the United States and continued through the fall internationally.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "cognitive liberty" [...] {{was coined}} by neuroethicist Dr. Wrye Sententia and legal theorist and lawyer Richard Glen <b>Boire,</b> the founders and {{directors}} of the non-profit [...] (CCLE). [...] Sententia and <b>Boire</b> define cognitive liberty as [...] "the right of each individual to think independently and autonomously, to use the full power {{of his or her}} mind, and to engage in multiple modes of thought." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sententia and <b>Boire</b> {{conceived}} {{of the concept}} of cognitive liberty {{as a response to the}} increasing ability of technology to monitor and manipulate cognitive function, and the corresponding increase in the need to ensure individual cognitive autonomy and privacy. Sententia divides the practical application of cognitive liberty into two principles: ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard Glen <b>Boire,</b> {{a senior}} fellow at the Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics, has said that the theory that using salvia {{encouraged}} Brett to reach conclusions about the nature of life that were conducive to suicide could apply to some of the greatest pieces of art in the history of the world. [...] "It would make Nietzsche a controlled substance. There is a lot of cultural production out there that shows a way of looking at the world that isn't all sunny and rosy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though {{this element}} of {{cognitive}} liberty is often {{defined as an}} individual’s freedom from state interference with human cognition, Jan Christoph Bublitz and Reinhard Merkel among others suggest that cognitive liberty should also prevent other, non-state entities from interfering with an individual’s mental [...] "inner realm". Bublitz and Merkel propose {{the introduction of a}} new criminal offense punishing [...] "interventions severely interfering with another’s mental integrity by undermining mental control or exploiting pre-existing mental weakness." [...] Direct interventions that reduce or impair cognitive capacities such as memory, concentration, and willpower; alter preferences, beliefs, or behavioral dispositions; elicit inappropriate emotions; or inflict clinically identifiable mental injuries would all be prima facie impermissible and subject to criminal prosecution. Sententia and <b>Boire</b> have also expressed concern that corporations and other non-state entities might utilize emerging neurotechnologies to alter individuals' mental processes without their consent.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his final}} two films, Resnais again drew his source {{material}} from the theatre. Vous n'avez encore rien vu (You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet!, 2012) was adapted from two plays by Jean Anouilh, and it assembled thirteen actors (many of them regular performers in Resnais's earlier films) who have been summoned by the dying wish of an author to witness a new performance their roles {{in one of his}} plays. The film was shown in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. [...] Aimer, <b>boire</b> et chanter (2014) was the third film which Resnais adapted from a play by Alan Ayckbourn, in this case Life of Riley, in which three couples are thrown into confusion by the news that a shared friend has a terminal illness. Three weeks before Resnais's death, the film received its premiere in the competition section of the 64th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2014, where it won a Silver Bear award [...] "for a feature film that opens new perspectives". At the time of his death, Resnais was preparing a further Ayckbourn project, based on the 2013 play Arrivals & Departures.|$|E

She {{could see their}} mouths all smiling, their teeth white as they cried in their throats: [...] "Vaali! Vaali! <b>Boire</b> à vous." ...|$|E

6000|$|The cholera {{has laid}} bare {{the secrets of}} drunkenness, all over Europe. At first we were {{astonished}} when the disease got among the upper classes; but, with all my experience, I confess I was astonished at hearing it whispered of a gentleman, as I certainly did in a dozen instances--"mais il avait l'habitude de <b>boire</b> trop." [...] Cholera, beyond a question, killed many a sober man, but it also laid bare the fault of many a devotee of the bottle.|$|E
60|$|Female pigeons {{occasionally}} feel {{a strong}} antipathy towards certain males, without any assignable cause. Thus MM. Boitard and Corbié, whose experience extended over forty-five years, state: “Quand une femelle éprouve de l’antipathie pour un mâle avec lequel on veut l’accoupler, malgré tous les feux de l’amour, malgré l’alpiste et le chènevis dont on la nourrit pour augmenter son ardeur, malgré un emprisonnement de six mois et même d’un an, elle refuse constamment ses caresses; les avances empressées, les agaceries, les tournoiemens, les tendres roucoulemens, rien ne peut lui plaire ni l’émouvoir; gonflée, boudeuse, blottie dans un coin de sa prison, elle n’en sort que pour <b>boire</b> et manger, ou pour repousser avec une espèce de rage des caresses devenues trop pressantes.”[169] On the other hand, Mr. Harrison Weir has himself observed, and has heard from, several breeders, that a female pigeon will occasionally take a strong fancy {{for a particular}} male, and will desert her own mate for him. Some females, according to another experienced observer, Riedel,[170] are of a profligate disposition, and prefer almost any stranger to their own mate. Some amorous males, called by our English fanciers “gay birds,” are so successful in their gallantries, that, as Mr. H. Weir informs me, they must be shut up, {{on account of the}} mischief which they cause.|$|E
6000|$|Monsieur S------ shaving himself {{yesterday}} morning. He was {{in excellent}} spirits, {{and could not}} keep his tongue or body still, more than {{long enough to make}} two or three consecutive strokes at his beard. Then he would turn, flourishing his razor and grimacing joyously, enacting droll antics, breaking out into scraps and verses of drinking-songs, [...] "A <b>boire!</b> a boire!"--then laughing heartily, and crying, [...] "Vive la gaite!" [...] then resuming his task, looking into the glass with grave face, on which, however, a grin would soon break out anew, and all his pranks would be repeated with variations. He turned this foolery to philosophy, by observing that mirth contributed to goodness of heart, and to make us love our fellow-creatures. Conversing with him in the evening, he affirmed, with evident belief in the truth of what he said, that he would have no objection, except {{that it would be a}} very foolish thing, to expose his whole heart, his whole inner man, to the view of the world. Not that there would not be much evil discovered there; but, as he was conscious of being in a state of mental and moral improvement, working out his progress onward, he would not shrink from such a scrutiny. This talk was introduced by his mentioning the [...] "Minister's Black Veil," [...] which he said he had seen translated into French, as an exercise, by a Miss Appleton of Bangor.|$|E

5000|$|Air à <b>boire</b> is a French term {{which was}} used between the mid-17th and mid-18th centuries for a [...] "drinking song". These were {{generally}} strophic, syllabic songs to light texts. Its predecessor was chanson pour <b>boire,</b> the difference being mainly that chansons pour <b>boire</b> were for one voice with lute accompaniment, whereas airs à <b>boire</b> are generally {{for more than one}} voice.|$|E
50|$|In France, {{historical}} {{types of}} drinking songs are Chanson pour <b>boire</b> and Air à <b>boire.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Airs à <b>boire</b> are {{generally}} contrasted with airs sérieux, which typically had texts on more serious matters, such as [...] "love, pastoral scenes, and political satire." [...] Most airs à <b>boire</b> occur in publications from Paris, and are {{for one to}} three voices and lute accompaniment. In the 1690s airs à <b>boire</b> were so popular that new collections containing them were published every three months in Paris. In the period when the term was used, over 250 collections of songs with the title Airs sérieux et à <b>boire</b> were published.|$|E
5000|$|Chanson pour <b>boire</b> is a {{term for}} a French {{drinking}} song, frequently coupled with chanson pour danser (or [...] "song for dancing"). It was used in from about 1627-1670. It {{is different from the}} air à <b>boire</b> primarily by the period the term was used, and that chansons pour <b>boire</b> are usually for one voice with lute accompaniment, and airs à <b>boire</b> are for multiple voices with lute accompaniment. Both are fairly simple; strophic, with syllabic settings of light texts. The texts are usually about drinking and are humorous.|$|E
