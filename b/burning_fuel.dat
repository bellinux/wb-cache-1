5|$|The {{damage caused}} to the North Tower {{destroyed}} any {{means of escape}} at the impact zone or above it. All stairwells and elevators from the 92ndfloor up were rendered impassable, trapping 1,344people. According to the Commission Report, hundreds were killed instantly by the impact; the rest were trapped and died from the subsequent fire and smoke, the eventual collapse, or (in some cases) after jumping or falling from the building. Elevator shafts channeled burning jet fuel through the building. At least one elevator shaft carried <b>burning</b> <b>fuel</b> downward, exploding on the 77thfloor, the 22ndfloor, and at street level on the West Side Lobby.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} throughout the game, two additional ships become available for use. Each of the game's three ships offers a different balance of speed, weapons, and maneuverability. Within the levels, the player may collect power-ups that enhance the ship's weaponry. Weapons are categorized into three different types: primary weapons, secondary weapons, and countermeasures. Primary weapons {{range from a}} variety of laser weapons to the Plasma Cannon and the Napalm Cannon, which projects a stream of <b>burning</b> <b>fuel.</b> Secondary weapons include different types of missiles, while countermeasures range from proximity mines to portable turrets. Most primary weapons consume energy in different rate, but some, such as the Napalm Cannon, use their own type of ammunition. In contrast, all secondary weapons and countermeasures require their own ammunition suppliers.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{target for}} the bomb was the city of Kokura, but it {{was found to be}} obscured by clouds and drifting smoke from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day. This covered 70% of the area over Kokura, obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, <b>burning</b> <b>fuel</b> and repeatedly exposing the aircraft to the heavy defenses of Yawata, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese anti-aircraft fire was getting close, and Second Lieutenant Jacob Beser, who was monitoring Japanese communications, reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.|$|E

5|$|After {{exceeding}} the original departure time limit by a half-hour, Bockscar, accompanied by The Great Artiste, proceeded to Kokura, thirty minutes away. The delay at the rendezvous {{had resulted in}} clouds and drifting smoke over Kokura from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day. Additionally, the Yawata Steel Works intentionally burned coal tar, to produce black smoke. The clouds and smoke resulted in 70% of the area over Kokura being covered, obscuring the aiming point.

After them, Hauptmann Herbert Meisel's III Gruppe was heading on {{the left of the}} formation for Thorney Island. Hauptmann Walter Seigel's I./StG 3 headed for Gosport on the extreme left. Each Ju 87 was loaded with 550-lb bombs under the main fuselage and four 11-lb bombs and two under each wing. The Bf 109s would not take off for some time. The long trip and low speed of the Ju 87s meant there was plenty of time to catch up without <b>burning</b> <b>fuel</b> keeping close contact with the Stukas.|$|E
5|$|Operating an {{air-breathing}} {{jet engine}} at velocities {{of up to}} Mach5.5 poses numerous engineering problems; several previous engines proposed by other designers have worked well as jet engines, but performed poorly as rockets. This engine design aims {{to be a good}} jet engine within the atmosphere, as well as being an excellent rocket engine outside; however, the conventional problem posed by operating at Mach5.5 has been that the air coming into the engine rapidly heats up as it is compressed into the engine; due to certain thermodynamic effects, this greatly reduces the thrust that can be produced by <b>burning</b> <b>fuel.</b> Attempts to avoid these issues has typically resulted in the engine being much heavier (scramjets/ramjets) or has greatly reduced the thrust generated (conventional turbojets/ramjets); in either of these scenarios, the end result would be an engine that possesses a poor thrust to weight ratio at high speeds, which in turn would be too heavy to assist much in reaching orbit.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{two factors}} {{involved in the}} environmental health risk of indoor air pollution for households in Indonesia. First, I examine the determinants of a household’s decision to switch to cleaner <b>burning</b> <b>fuels.</b> Based on the decision of a household to switch to cleaner <b>burning</b> <b>fuels,</b> I test if the decision of a household to switch to cleaner fuels impacts respiratory health outcomes. There are real and immediate policy implications {{for this type of}} analysis. Indoor air pollution has serious health impacts on individuals in developing nations, especially women and children. Understanding the factors that contribute to a household’s decision to adopt cleaner <b>burning</b> <b>fuels</b> has implications for the design of improved stove intervention programs. The ability to quantify the health benefits of stove switching will assist policy makers in allocating scarce resources for interventions, and justifying these interventions to funders. With renewed interest in improved stove projects and funding dollars being spent to scale up successful initiatives {{there is a need for}} a better understanding of the characteristics of the targeted population. To justify additional funding for improved stove efforts there is a need for more rigorous impact evaluations, linking them to improved health and increased productivity...|$|R

30|$|As can be seen, {{the amount}} of {{high-temperature}} heat needed is significant due to the highly endothermic reduction reaction. Such heat, however, can be provided either through concentrated solar energy—even if this option could not allow the continuous operation of the system—or by <b>burning</b> a <b>fuel,</b> for example, additional methane or renewable fuels, thereby enabling the system to run continuously. Even combined solutions can be proposed, by providing heat from <b>burning</b> <b>fuels</b> only to integrate the solar heat flux {{when it is not}} sufficient. The analysis of these solutions has not been included in the paper, as it is outside of the scope.|$|R

25|$|Compared with {{conventional}} unleaded gasoline, ethanol is a particulate-free <b>burning</b> <b>fuel</b> source that combusts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water and aldehydes. The Clean Air Act requires {{the addition of}} oxygenates to reduce carbon monoxide emissions in the United States. The additive MTBE is currently being phased out due to ground water contamination, hence ethanol becomes an attractive alternative additive. Current production methods include air pollution from the manufacturer of macronutrient fertilizers such as ammonia.|$|E
25|$|Approximately {{three minutes}} after the initial {{explosion}}, a bomb mounted on the Phantom exploded, having been engulfed in flames from the earlier explosions and <b>burning</b> <b>fuel.</b> This explosion blew a larger hole, approximately eight feet by seven feet, in the flight deck. The heat from the blast ignited additional fires on the 03 level, and debris from the explosion caused holes in the deck; this allowed <b>burning</b> <b>fuel</b> to spread further, entering the 02 and 01 levels and eventually the first deck. This explosion also damaged the twin agent units that provided firefighting foam to the area, rendering them inoperable as well as severing fire hoses in the area. In short order two 500 lb (227 kg) Mark 82 bombs detonated in succession. Several {{minutes after the}} detonations a bomb rack holding three Mk 82 bombs exploded. This blast tore a large hole, approximately 18 feet by 22 feet, into the flight deck, and ruptured a 6,000-gallon fuel tank mounted on a tanker aircraft; a massive fireball resulted from the fuel igniting, spreading the fire further. All told, eighteen explosions occurred, blowing eight holes into the flight deck and beyond.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol is {{naturally}} {{produced by the}} fermentation of sugars by yeasts or via petrochemical processes, and is most commonly considered as a popular recreational drug.

25|$|Masonry heaters were {{developed}} to control air flow in stoves.

25|$|The heat source, {{contained}} within the firebox, is the energy released by the combustion, typically of a solid or liquid fuel, creating a by-product of hot combustion gases. If wood, coal or coke is used as the combustion material it is introduced through a door, typically by a fireman, onto a set of grates where ashes fall away from the <b>burning</b> <b>fuel.</b> If oil is used as the fuel, a door allows adjusting of the air flow, maintenance and access for cleaning the oil jets.|$|E
25|$|In {{fighting}} {{a fire at}} a directly vertical spewing wellhead, high explosives, such as dynamite were {{used to create a}} blast wave that pushes the <b>burning</b> <b>fuel</b> and local atmospheric oxygen away from the well. (This is a similar principle to blowing out a candle.) The flame is removed and the fuel can continue to spill out without igniting. Generally, explosives were placed within 55 gallon drums, the explosives surrounded by fire retardant chemicals, and then the drums are wrapped with insulating material with a horizontal crane being used to bring the drum as close to the burning area as possible.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of FBI's investigation, because of the {{possibility}} that international terrorists might have been involved, assistance was requested from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). CIA analysts, relying on sound-propagation analysis, were able to conclude that the witnesses could not be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, but were seeing a trail of <b>burning</b> <b>fuel</b> coming from the aircraft after the initial explosion. This conclusion was reached after calculating how long it took for the sound of the initial explosion to reach the witnesses, and using that to correlate the witness observations with the accident sequence. In all cases the witnesses could not be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, as the plane had already exploded before their observations began.|$|E

25|$|The {{detonation}} destroyed White's and McCain's aircraft, {{along with}} their remaining fuel and ordnance, blew a crater in the armored flight deck, and sprayed the deck and crew with bomb fragments and <b>burning</b> <b>fuel.</b> Damage Control Team No. 8 took {{the brunt of the}} initial blast; Chief Farrier and all but three of his men were killed instantly; the survivors were critically injured. Lieutenant Commander White had managed to escape his burning aircraft, but was unable to get far enough away in time; White was killed along with the firefighters in the first bomb explosion. In the tightly packed formation on the deck, the two nearest A-4s to White's and McCain's (both fully fueled and bomb-laden) were heavily damaged and began to burn, causing the fire to spread and more bombs to quickly cook off.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} the rocket had also {{dislodged}} two of the 1000-lb AN-M65 bombs, which fell to the deck, and lay in the pool of <b>burning</b> <b>fuel</b> between White's aircraft and that of Lieutenant Commander John McCain.
