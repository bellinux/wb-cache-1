40|$|Recently, {{back-pressure}} {{steam turbines}} {{have become the}} focal point in many cogeneration applications. This {{is a result of}} the savings in operating costs associated with the generation of electrical or mechanical power coincident with the economical use of available thermal energy. The benefits and constraints of back-pressure systems, however, are not always readily apparent and may result in the misapplication of this technology. This paper, therefore, will examine new turbine installations and backpressure retrofits and will determine the most economical <b>back-pressure</b> <b>turbine</b> applications. A generalized methodology is highlighted, allowing the reader to readily evaluate and determine the economic justification of back-pressure turbines in many cogeneration applications. The impact on plant energy use and cost is calculated, and the effects of load variation and the value of high-efficiency turbines are discussed. The specific process plant case studies reviewed involve back-pressure turbines of 100 to 5000 hp for mechanical drives, for generator drives, and as pressure reducing station replacements...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} of the 21 st century is to reduce the greenhouse effect. In order to compete with fossil fuels that are emitting large amounts of greenhouse gases, emission-neutral solutions must be developed together with more efficient technological solutions. Biomass cogeneration is one of these new technologies that enables combined production of electricity and heat (cogeneration) while reducing the amount of fossil carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere. In France, cogeneration is not well developed, therefore the French Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development has decided to launch calls for tenders focused on the production of green electricity from biomass fuel. This master´s thesis investigates the different technological options that exist to supply process heat to a French agro-food company while co-producing green electricity. Two different plants are studied. The first one currently requires 100 t/h of steam at a pressure of 14 bar. The new biomass plant will be designed for year-round production of 45 t/h of steam at two levels of pressure (30 t/h at 8 bar and 15 t/h at 14 bar). The second factory does not work with the same schedule and its steam demand is divided into two periods. The campaign period lasts 5000 h/year and requires 25 t/h of steam at a pressure of 12 bar while the inter-campaign period is evaluated to 3000 h/year with a steam demand of 5 t/h at the same pressure. The steam is currently produced with natural gas boilers. The results of the study indicate that installing a cogeneration system composed of an extraction-condensing steam turbine achieves a lower payback period (5 years) than a CHP plant with a <b>back-pressure</b> <b>turbine</b> (8 years). The use of a heat only boiler leads to a high payback period due to its lack of electricity production. From an energy performance point of view, using a <b>back-pressure</b> <b>turbine</b> leads to a total efficiency of around 80 %, whereas the extraction-condensing (EC) turbine total efficiency is equal to 60 % on average. This efficiency decrease could guide the choice towards a <b>back-pressure</b> <b>turbine.</b> However, this technology is penalized by its low electricity production: 60 % less electricity than for a EC turbine. Under current policy conditions in France, electricity production from renewable sources is favoured by a higher selling price on the grid (140 €/MWh compared to 64 €/MWh for purchased electricity). This means that the more electricity is produced the more the project will be profitable. This higher selling price is supported by several policies: the CSPE (economical contribution of the electricity consumers for the development of green electricity production), calls for tenders. In order to improve usage of the fuel energy supplied to the cogeneration power plant, it is possible to add an absorption chiller to the process. Cogeneration then becomes trigeneration and electricity, heat and also cooling are produced from the same source of energy. The addition of an absorption chiller does not have a big impact on the payback period (same payback period as for cogeneration) and enables a total efficiency increase from 62 % to 67 %. Even if this technology is not widespread nowadays, its use seems to be interesting for industries that need heat and cooling for their processes...|$|E

40|$|To {{reduce the}} exergy loss that {{is caused by}} the {{high-grade}} extraction steam of traditional heating mode of combined heat and power (CHP) generating unit, a high back-pressure cascade heating technology for two jointly constructed large-scale steam turbine power generating units is proposed. The Unit 1 makes full use of the exhaust steam heat from high <b>back-pressure</b> <b>turbine,</b> and the Unit 2 uses the original heating mode of extracting steam condensation, which significantly reduces the flow rate of high-grade extraction steam. The typical 2 × 350 MW supercritical CHP units in northern China were selected as object. The boundary conditions for heating were determined based on the actual climatic conditions and heating demands. A model to analyze the performance of the high back-pressure cascade heating supply units for off-design operating conditions was developed. The load distributions between high back-pressure exhaust steam direct supply and extraction steam heating supply were described under various conditions, based on which, the heating efficiency of the CHP units with the high back-pressure cascade heating system was analyzed. The design heating load and maximum heating supply load were determined as well. The results indicate that the average coal consumption rate during the heating season is 205. 46 g/kWh for the design heating load after the retrofit, which is about 51. 99 g/kWh lower than that of the traditional heating mode. The coal consumption rate of 199. 07 g/kWh can be achieved for the maximum heating load. Significant energy saving and CO 2 emission reduction are obtained...|$|E

30|$|Steam {{at three}} {{different}} pressures {{is used in}} the simulations of utilities, depending on the configuration. For the 1 G stand-alone plant, a moderate pressure of 6 bar and a low pressure of 4 bar are assumed to be required; 6 bar is chosen since the dryer is designed to be operating at 150 °C. In the 2 G plant, high-pressure steam at 20 bar and low-pressure steam at 4 bar are chosen since pretreatment is carried out at 190 °C, {{and the rest of the}} process is operated below 140 °C. In the combined plant it is presumed that steam at all three pressures is available from the beginning of the process. It is assumed that cooling water between 10 - 19 °C at a pressure of 1 bar is used in all plants. In all cases except the 1 G stand-alone plant, it is also assumed that a CHP plant supplies the ethanol plants with steam. Primary steam is designed to be produced at 91 bar and 470 °C, and electricity is produced by a steam turbine and a <b>back-pressure</b> <b>turbine.</b> The CHP plant is not included in the pinch analysis. The CHP system is designed to be used to incinerate residual material (excluding any DDGS production) and biogas produced in the process. The residual material consists of a mixture of solids from the separation step after distillation and syrup from evaporation. When the incineration of residual material and biogas is not sufficient to run the process, natural gas, assumed to be pure methane, was added. The 1 G stand-alone plant is presumed to be entirely powered by natural gas, as this is relatively common in the corn ethanol plants operating in the USA today [42]. Optionally, straw could have been used as external energy, however, methane was used in this case for easy comparison with existing infrastructure. Other sources of energy can be used to run the 1 G plant. For example, sugarcane ethanol plants are often supplied with energy from the incineration of bagasse [43] and residual materials from the field, while at the 1 G wheat ethanol plant in Norrköping, Sweden, biomass and domestic waste are used to produce steam [44]. The electricity needed in the plants was included when calculating the energy need to produce one kg of ethanol, by assuming an electricity requirement of 0.84 MJ/kg ethanol. The assumption was made as there are limited data available concerning the energy used for electricity in the considered cases. This value corresponds to an average electricity demand described in a 1 G ethanol corn plant [29].|$|E

40|$|When {{estimating}} aggregated {{potential for}} {{energy efficiency and}} the introduction of new, efficient, technology solutions within the pulp and paper industry {{it is important to consider}} the existing energy system of the individual mills, since the present energy situation at each mill has a significant effect on the potential for future changes. Recognising the need to assess the existing system, one main problem is that detailed steam data is not publicly available or easily accessible, neither on the mill level nor the national level. In the study presented in this paper, a model is proposed for assessing the steam balance of a kraft pulp mill, assuming only a limited amount of public and easily accessible data. The model was developed and validated using detailed data from both model mills and real mills. From the validation of the model it was concluded that the model provides a good estimate of the total steam production and consumption, with an accuracy of +/- 8 %, and a fair estimate of the steam use at different pressure levels. The model was also applied in a benchmark study of the Swedish kraft pulp industry. In the benchmark study the potential for increased electricity production was analysed, assuming the steam balance for each mill given by the model. The results showed that all the kraft pulp mills in Sweden could increase their power production substantially by investing purely in new, larger, <b>back-pressure</b> <b>turbines</b> to avoid throttling any steam. If at the same time the mills invest in steam-saving measures, saving LP steam, and a condensing turbine, electricity production could increase even further, making all mills self-sufficient, and most mills even net exporters, of electric power. However, to analyse the potential for steam-saving measures further as well as the introduction of technology solutions other than increased electricity production, such as black liquor gasification, the model needs to be developed further...|$|R

40|$|The techno-economic {{potential}} for new technologies in pulp mills is conventionally studied assuming annual averages, {{based on the}} assumption that the pulp mill is continuously operated at a constant production rate close to its design capacity. Recent work has shown, however, that a technology, such as lignin extraction, which can improve the operating flexibility of the pulp mill utility system, has a value associated with its flexibility that is not captured in such average-value models. These previous results indicated a risk of significant errors if heat load variations were not properly modelled. This paper presents a multi-period optimization model for the planning of design and operating decisions connected to pulp mill utility systems, which in this work has been extended with <b>back-pressure</b> and condensing <b>turbine</b> models. The model optimizes technology selection, equipment capacities and operating loads under the influence of demand variations, considering part-load efficiencies and operating load limits. Application of the model to an illustrative example showed that lignin extraction can compete with electricity production already at a lignin price of 22 €/MWh in the presence of variations due to poor off-design performance for the turbines.

40|$|AbstractSustainable {{development}} requires combining {{economic viability}} with energy and environment conservation and ensuring social benefits. It is conceptualized that for designing a micro industry for sustainable rural industrialization, all these aspects should be integrated right up front. The concept includes; (a) utilization of local produce for value addition in {{a cluster of}} villages and enhancing income of the target population; (b) use of renewable energy and total utilization of energy generated by co and trigeneration (combining electric power production with heat utilization for heating and cooling); (c) conservation of water and complete recycling of effluents; (d) total utilization of all wastes for achieving closure towards a zero waste system. Enhanced economic viability and sustainability is achieved by integration of appropriate technologies into the industrial complex. To prove the concept, a model Micro Industrial Complex (MIC) {{has been set up}} in a semi arid desert region in Rajasthan, India at village Malunga in Jodhpur district. A biomass powered boiler and steam turbine system is used to generate 100 - 200 KVA of electric power and high energy steam for heating and cooling processes downstream. The unique feature of the equipment is a 100 - 150 kW <b>back-pressure</b> steam <b>turbine,</b> utilizing 3 - 4 tph (tonnes per hour) steam, developed by M/s IB Turbo. The biomass boiler raises steam at about 20 barg 3 tph, which is passed through a turbine to yield about 150 kW of electrical power. The steam let out at a back pressure of 1 - 3 barg has high exergy and this is passed on as thermal energy (about 2 MW), for use in various applications depending on the local produce and resources. The biomass fuel requirement for the boiler is 0. 5 - 0. 75 tph depending on its calorific value. In the current model, the electricity produced is used for running an oil expeller to extract castor oil and the castor cake is used as fuel in the boiler. The steam is used in a Multi Effect Distillation (MED) unit for drinking water production and in a Vapour Absorption Machine (VAM) for cooling, for banana ripening application. Additional steam is available for extraction of herbs such as mint and processing local vegetables. In this paper, we discuss the financial and economic viability of the system and show how the energy, water and materials are completely recycled and how the benefits are directed to the weaker sections of the community...|$|R
40|$|The Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) Project is a 25 MW (net) {{powerplant}} {{and associated}} geothermal well field {{proposed for the}} Puna District of the Island of Hawaii. The project, located in the Kapoho section of the Kilauea Lower East Rift Geothermal Resources Subzone, will sell the generated electricity to the Hawaii Electric Light Company (HELCO) for the Island of Hawaii. Since the proposed project is located within {{an area where the}} designated Geothermal Resources Subzone underlies an agricultural state land use district, the project requires a Geothermal Resource Permit from the County of Hawaii. The PGV Project is consistent with the stated objectives of providing energy self-sufficiency and diversifying Hawaii's economic base. The project will develop a new alternate energy source as well as provide additional information {{about the nature of the}} geothermal resource. These objectives are included in Hawaii's State Plan, the State Energy Functional Plan, and the County of Hawaii General Plan. On December 10, 1986, Thermal Power Company (TPC), as then operator of the Puna Geothermal Venture partnership, submitted anapplication to the Hawaii County Planning Department (HCPD) for a Geothermal Resource Permit (GRP) for the PGV Project. TPC also requested that the HCPD be the accepting agency for an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that TPC would voluntarily prepare and submit for the PGV Project. Although the HCPD determined that there were no clear requirements for preparation of an EIS, the HCPD agreed to act as accepting agency for the EIS and deferred acceptance of the PGV Project GRP application until after acceptance of the ElS. The Final ElS for the PGV Project was accepted on December 28, 1987, although the Hawaii County Planning Director again noted that the PGV Project did not require the filing of an ElS. However, further processing of the GRP application has not occurred because the entire interest inthe PGV partnership was purchased during the first half of 1988 by AMOR VI Corporation and AMOR VIII Corporation (AMOR Corporations), two wholly-owned subsidiaries of Ormat Energy Systems, Inc. of Sparks, Nevada. Since the purchase, PGV has reviewed the previous design of the PGV Project to determine if it remains entirely appropriate. As a result of this design review, PGV has decided to alter several aspects of the previously proposed PGV Project design to optimize production operations and further reduce the potential for environmental impacts. Principal among these proposed changes is the use in the power plant of <b>back-pressure</b> steam <b>turbines,</b> in combination with air-cooled binary cycle turbines, in place ofthe steam turbines and cooling towers proposed by TPC. This currently proposed power plant configuration applies a closed cycle for the geothermal fluid, thus essentially eliminating hydrogen sulfide emissions during normal operations and eliminating the need for cooling towers. Most other environmental impacts from this revised PGV Project will be very similar to those of the previously proposed PGV Project because the revised PGV Project will use the same geothermal resource, the same geothermal wellpads, and the same power plant location as the previously proposed PGV Project. This amendment to the GRP application has been prepared to replace, in its entirety, the GRP application submitted to the Hawaii County Planning Department in December, 1986. For clarity sake, Chapter 2 of this application is a summary description of the revised PGV Project, drawing comparisons with the previously proposed PGV Project, as appropriate. A more detailed description of the revised PGV Project follows in Chapter 3, organized to follow the requirements of Rule 12, Geothermal Resource Permits, of the county of Hawaii Planning Commission Rules of Practice and Procedure. As required by Rule 12, Chapter 3 of this amended application also summarizes the PGV Project potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures.
