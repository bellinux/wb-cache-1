5|$|Immediately after filming <b>Basic</b> <b>Instinct</b> 2, {{he began}} work on The Reaping (2007) in Louisiana, in which he played science teacher Doug Blackwell {{opposite}} Hilary Swank. The role had been offered to him quite late in pre-production, and he flew to Baton Rouge the Monday after <b>Basic</b> <b>Instinct</b> 2 wrapped. He took the role {{because he was a}} fan of Swank, and Hopkins' film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (2004), and he preferred the thriller aspect of the Reaping script above the horror aspect. After a week of filming, production had to be suspended when Hurricane Katrina hit the state. He found the filming schedule quite demanding, particularly the three weeks of night filming and a scene in which his character is attacked by a plague of locusts, most of which were computer-generated in post-production but some were real on camera. The Reaping was released in 2007 and performed badly in cinemas. Despite the failures of both films, Morrissey was grateful that they opened him up to more film offers from Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Of the top 50 {{grossing}} {{movies of}} the year, 38 nominations went to 13 films on the list. Only A Few Good Men (6th), Unforgiven (17th), Malcolm X (30th) and Scent of a Woman (38th) were nominated for directing, acting, screenwriting, or Best Picture. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were Aladdin (1st), Batman Returns (3rd), <b>Basic</b> <b>Instinct</b> (8th), The Bodyguard (9th), Under Siege (12th), Bram Stoker's Dracula (14th), The Last of the Mohicans (16th), Death Becomes Her (22nd), and Alien³ (26th).|$|E
5|$|The turn of {{the decade}} brought Scorsese's {{black-and-white}} Raging Bull (cowritten by Schrader); an acknowledged masterpiece—the American Film Institute ranks it as the greatest American film of the 1980s and the fourth greatest of all time—it is also a retreat, telling {{a story of a}} boxer's moral self-destruction that recalls in both theme and visual ambience noir dramas such as Body and Soul (1947) and Champion (1949). From 1981, the popular Body Heat, written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan, invokes a different set of classic noir elements, this time in a humid, erotically charged Florida setting; its success confirmed the commercial viability of neo-noir, {{at a time when the}} major Hollywood studios were becoming increasingly risk averse. The mainstreaming of neo-noir is evident in such films as Black Widow (1987), Shattered (1991), and Final Analysis (1992). Few neo-noirs have made more money or more wittily updated the tradition of the noir double-entendre than <b>Basic</b> <b>Instinct</b> (1992), directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas. The film also demonstrates how neo-noir's polychrome palette can reproduce many of the expressionistic effects of classic black-and-white noir. Poison Ivy (1992) makes use of similar devices executed in <b>Basic</b> <b>Instinct,</b> including a shady, seductive femme-fatale with ulterior motives.|$|E

5|$|Gay {{characters}} {{also were}} often killed {{off at the}} end, such as the death of Sandy Dennis' character {{at the end of}} The Fox in 1968. If not victims, lesbians were depicted as villains or morally corrupt, such as portrayals of brothel madames by Barbara Stanwyck in Walk on the Wild Side from 1962 and Shelley Winters in The Balcony in 1963. Lesbians as predators were presented in Rebecca (1940), women's prison films like Caged (1950), or in the character Rosa Klebb in From Russia with Love (1963). Lesbian vampire themes have reappeared in Dracula's Daughter (1936), Blood and Roses (1960), Vampyros Lesbos (1971), and The Hunger (1983). <b>Basic</b> <b>Instinct</b> (1992) featured a bisexual murderer played by Sharon Stone; it was one of several films that set off a storm of protests about the depiction of gays as predators.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Knowles laying on a table, lit with a {{flashing}} bright red light. While a siren is blaring, she half-stands and sings while {{dancing on the}} table. She proceeds to an interrogation room {{similar to the one}} in the film <b>Basic</b> <b>Instinct.</b> Knowles sings the first verse in a house with a seashore backdrop. She wants to escape, and struggles with masked and uniformed guards in a hallway. She is then returned to the interrogation room. In between cuts, she sings in a corner of a room, is seen reflected in a mirror while screaming, and among a group of reporters. As the song closes, Knowles is shown crying. The video ends with a close-up view of Knowles putting on red lipstick. The scene shows only her lips.|$|E

25|$|<b>Basic</b> <b>Instinct</b> is {{the fourth}} studio album by American singer Ciara. It was {{released}} on December 10, 2010, by LaFace Records and Jive Records. Executive-produced by A agent Mark Pitts, Ciara, Tricky Stewart and The-Dream, <b>Basic</b> <b>Instinct</b> returns Ciara to her urban roots with mid-tempo R cuts and bass-heavy pop and dance songs. Aside from production by Stewart and The-Dream, Ciara collaborated with production by Soundz, Infinity and T-Minus. Frequent collaborator and friend Ludacris makes a guest vocal appearance, as does labelmate and fellow Atlanta-native, Usher. After her previous album, Fantasy Ride, suffered numerous leaks and pushbacks, information about <b>Basic</b> <b>Instinct</b> was kept confidential until the first single was released and album was complete.|$|E

50|$|The authors imply, {{that even}} if we begin with honourable intentions, {{there will be some}} who will let their <b>basic</b> <b>instincts</b> take control.

Take for example, a leader {{becoming}} overly ambitious, to the point of harming his people for more power.|$|R

50|$|That Israel is the devil, {{the root}} of all evil, a {{criminal}} cancer that must be excised from the Muslim body politic—these propositions are not ephemeral feelings for most Iranian Muslims, but rather eternal truths that gradually, through endless, tantra-like repetition, have cloyed in the conscious mind while simultaneously installing themselves beneath the level of immediate emotion and awareness, in the place where <b>basic</b> <b>instincts,</b> automatic assumptions, and ontological verities reside.|$|R

50|$|Huffington has had {{a lifelong}} {{interest}} in spirituality; in her youth, together with Bernard Levin, she explored the Rajneesh movement, later dating est founder Werner Erhard and going on to become affiliated with John-Roger Hinkins' Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness. In 1994, she published a self-help book titled The Fourth Instinct, outlining her view that people should rise above the three <b>basic</b> <b>instincts</b> of survival, power, and sex to find their higher and better selves.|$|R
5000|$|His {{main idea}} was that play is {{basically}} useful, and {{so it can be}} explained by the normal process of evolution by natural selection. When animals 'play' they are practising <b>basic</b> <b>instincts,</b> such as fighting, for survival. This is translated from the original as [...] "pre-tuning". Despite this insight, Groos' work is seldom read today, and his connection of play with aesthetics is thought [...] "misguided". Another area of study was the psychology of literature, including statistical analysis.|$|R

Verhoeven {{then went on}} to direct big Hollywood movies like RoboCop (1987), Total Recall (1990) and <b>Basic</b> <b>Instinct</b> (1992), and returned with Dutch film Black Book ("Zwartboek", 2006).|$|E

50|$|In Saptapadi, he decries {{the evils}} of {{untouchability}} and the caste system. In Subhodayam and Swayam Krushi he emphasizes the dignity and respectability of manual labor. In Subhalekha, he deals, in a humorous way, with the dowry system-one of the major evils in today's society.

25|$|All {{sound is}} {{inherently}} powerful. If a hunter kills a lion {{he can see}} it, touch it, feel it and smell it.

25|$|Nema aviona za Zagreb (There Is No Plane to Zagreb) is a 2012 Dutch film by Louis van Gasteren. The {{film is a}} {{retrospective}} {{of events in the}} director's life from 1964 to 1969, filmed by him in that period and reflected on from his vantage point over 40 years later at the age of 90. It is also Jan de Bont's first film credit as cinematographer since 1992's <b>Basic</b> <b>Instinct.</b>|$|E
25|$|Verhoeven {{followed}} those successes {{with the}} equally intense and provocative <b>Basic</b> <b>Instinct</b> (1992), an erotic thriller. The ninth-highest-grossing {{film of the}} year, the movie was a return to themes Verhoeven had explored in Turkish Delight and The Fourth Man. The film's most notorious scene shows Sharon Stone's character in a police interrogation, where she uncrosses her legs, briefly revealing her vulva (she does not wear underwear underneath her skirt). The film received two Academy Awards nominations, for Film Editing and for Original Music.|$|E
