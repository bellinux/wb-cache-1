5|$|In <b>biochemistry,</b> {{physical}} and chemical constraints on mechanisms have caused some active site arrangements such as the catalytic triad to evolve independently in separate enzyme superfamilies.|$|E
5|$|Many {{currently}} available pharmaceuticals {{are derived from}} the secondary metabolites plants use {{to protect themselves from}} herbivores, including opium, aspirin, cocaine, and atropine. These chemicals have evolved to affect the <b>biochemistry</b> of insects in very specific ways. However, many of these biochemical pathways are conserved in vertebrates, including humans, and the chemicals act on human <b>biochemistry</b> in ways similar to that of insects. It has therefore been suggested that the study of plant-insect interactions may help in bioprospecting.|$|E

50|$|The short, sturdy {{bills of}} the Pterodroma species in this group, about 35 altogether, are adapted for soft prey {{taken at the}} surface; they have twisted {{intestines}} for digesting marine animals which have unusual <b>biochemistries.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{synthesise}} bioresponsive systems and selectively active <b>biochemistries</b> using polymer-based materials with supramolecular features {{has led to}} a surge in research interest directed towards their development as next generation biomaterials for drug delivery, medical device design and tissue engineering...|$|R
50|$|Ammonia and ammonia-water {{mixtures}} remain liquid {{at temperatures}} {{far below the}} freezing point of pure water, so such <b>biochemistries</b> might be well suited to planets and moons orbiting outside the water-based habitability zone. Such conditions could exist, for example, {{under the surface of}} Saturn's largest moon Titan.|$|R
5|$|As well as {{divergent}} {{evolution of}} function (and even the triad's nucleophile), catalytic triads show {{some of the}} best examples of convergent evolution. Chemical constraints on catalysis have led to the same catalytic solution independently evolving in at least 23 separate superfamilies. Their mechanism of action is consequently one of the best studied in <b>biochemistry.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{immunology}} {{was becoming}} more sophisticated, with the increasing role of molecular biology and <b>biochemistry.</b> Burnet was suspicious of {{the direction in which}} immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude was a factor in his decision to turn the institute's focus to immunology.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} ability to quickly grow and the {{relative}} ease with which they can be manipulated, bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of molecular biology, genetics and <b>biochemistry.</b> By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, enzymes and metabolic pathways in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms. This aim of understanding the <b>biochemistry</b> of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of enzyme kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. This is achievable in some well-studied bacteria, with models of Escherichia coli metabolism now being produced and tested. This understanding of bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use of biotechnology to bioengineer bacteria for the production of therapeutic proteins, such as insulin, growth factors, or antibodies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{possibility}} of life-forms being based on [...] "alternative" [...] <b>biochemistries</b> is {{the topic of}} an ongoing scientific discussion, informed by {{what is known about}} extraterrestrial environments and about the chemical behaviour of various elements and compounds. It is also a common subject in science fiction.|$|R
50|$|Formamide {{has also}} been {{proposed}} as an alternative solvent to water, perhaps {{with the ability to}} support life with alternative <b>biochemistries</b> to that currently found on Earth. It can be formed by the reaction of hydrogen cyanide and water, has a large dipole moment, and dissolves almost everything that will dissolve in water.|$|R
50|$|The {{term was}} used as early as 1973, when {{scientist}} Carl Sagan described it and other human chauvinisms that limit imagination of possible extraterrestrial life. It suggests that human beings, as carbon-based life forms who have never encountered any life that has evolved outside the Earth’s environment, may {{find it difficult to}} envision radically different <b>biochemistries.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Biochemistry</b> {{laboratories}} {{often use}} {{in vitro studies}} to explore ATP-dependent molecular processes. Enzyme inhibitors of ATP-dependent enzymes such as kinases are needed to examine the binding sites and transition states involved in ATP-dependent reactions. ATP analogs are also used in X-ray crystallography to determine a protein structure in complex with ATP, often together with other substrates.|$|E

5|$|Microorganisms are {{essential}} tools in biotechnology, <b>biochemistry,</b> genetics, and molecular biology. The yeasts brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) are important model organisms in science, {{since they are}} simple eukaryotes that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated. They are particularly valuable in genetics, genomics and proteomics, for example in protein production.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{biology is}} the study of biology at the {{molecular}} level.

40|$|Primary biliary {{cirrhosis}} (PBC) is {{a chronic}} cholestatic liver disease {{characterized by the}} immunological destruction of intralobular bile ducts and serum anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA). Based upon previous work of oral tolerance and autoimmunity, we hypothesized that feeding the mitochondrial autoantigens of PBC would alter the clinical course {{and the level of}} antimitochondrial antibodies. The bovine pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) was purified and 5 mg fed in gelatin capsules to 6 patients with early stage PBC for 6 months. Antimitochondrial antibodies and liver <b>biochemistries</b> were measured at every 3 months for 12 months. The clinical trial was completed for all patients except for 1 who showed deterioration of pre-existing skin rash during treatment, which disappeared within 2 weeks after treatment was discontinued. However, after 1 year, neither the titers of AMAs nor liver <b>biochemistries</b> were significantly changed by this treatment. This is the first trial to test the efficacy of oral tolerance induction in PBC. However, the data, which limited in scope, did not demonstrate efficacy and further highlights the difficulties in showing continuing evidence of tolerance induction in autoimmunity...|$|R

5|$|Plant <b>biochemistry</b> is {{the study}} of the {{chemical}} processes used by plants. Some of these processes are used in their primary metabolism like the photosynthetic Calvin cycle and crassulacean acid metabolism.

5|$|The {{assignment}} of Calostoma to the Boletales {{placed it in}} an order whose <b>biochemistry</b> has been the topic of research. Most members of the Boletales are characterized by compounds produced by the shikimate-chorismate pathway, including several distinctive pigments.|$|E
5|$|The {{non-magnetic}} {{character of}} zinc and {{its lack of}} color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to <b>biochemistry</b> and nutrition. This changed in 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site. The digestive enzyme carboxypeptidase became the second known zinc-containing enzyme in 1955.|$|E
40|$|Even {{though the}} {{prevalence}} of nephrolithiasis is increasing, {{our understanding of the}} pathophysiology has not kept pace and new therapeutic approaches have not emerged. The potential of a new physiological model (the fruitfly) is exciting.
