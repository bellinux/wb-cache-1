40|$|Abstract: Block {{designs are}} useful in {{experiments}} requiring elimination of heterogeneity in one direction. A block design {{is said to be}} incomplete if it contains at least one block that does not have full set of treatments. The most commonly used block designs are Balanced Incomplete Block (<b>BIB)</b> design <b>and</b> Partially Balanced Incomplete Block (PBIB) designs. Many research workers have contributed to the construction of these designs. Many series of BIB designs have been constructed using finite geometries, method of symmetrically repeated differences, using Hadamard matrices etc. <b>BIB</b> designs <b>and</b> their properties can be used to obtain many new series of <b>BIB</b> <b>and</b> PBIB designs. Some methods of construction of <b>BIB</b> <b>and</b> PBIB designs using existing series of BIB designs would be described...|$|R
