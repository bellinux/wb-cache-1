5|$|A {{collision}} with purple enemies is fatal to the character, whereas the green enemies {{are removed from}} the board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball is lethal to Q*bert, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time. Multicolored floating discs {{on either side of}} the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all enemies and <b>balls</b> <b>on</b> the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} important element of Pokémon gameplay. Although other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured, the player can use different kinds of Poké <b>Balls</b> <b>on</b> a wild Pokémon during battle. A successful capture adds the Pokémon to the player's active party or stores it if the player already has the maximum of six Pokémon. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used; the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is. Also, inflicting certain status effects such as sleep or paralysis add a multiplier to the capture rate, making it easier to capture wild Pokémon. Each species has a capture rate of its own as well.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, the player must acquire twelve Artifacts, which are prizes that are awarded after {{completing}} objectives such as winning minigames or beating bosses. Once having acquired twelve Artifacts, the player is granted access to a table called the Artifact Temple, which places six <b>balls</b> <b>on</b> the table at the same time. To complete the table, twelve different targets must be hit with the balls while they are bombarded by attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the Metroid Prime series. If all of the balls are lost, the table ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve Artifacts already collected but is forced to revisit another table and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at the Artifact Temple. Upon completing the Artifact Temple, access is granted to the final table, Impact Crater. After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature on the Impact Crater table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode.|$|E
50|$|Interesting {{situations}} {{could occur}} if somehow both the free {{ball and the}} real <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> are potted. If a colour was the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> (all reds were potted), and both the free ball and the actual <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> are potted, only the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> is scored. The free ball is respotted while the actual <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> will stay off the table. This {{is the only time}} when attempting to pot a colour that two balls can be potted without a foul occurring, because technically speaking both of the potted <b>balls</b> are <b>on.</b>|$|R

5|$|In February 2008, Ganguly joined as {{the captain}} of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) team, owned by Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan, {{as part of the}} Indian Premier League (IPL). On 18 April 2008, Ganguly led the KKR, in the IPL Twenty20 cricket match. They had a 140 run victory over Bangalore Royal Challengers (captained by Rahul Dravid and owned by Vijay Mallya). Ganguly opened the innings with Brendan McCullum and scored 10 runs while McCullum {{remained}} unbeaten, scoring 158 runs in 73 <b>balls.</b> <b>On</b> 1 May, in a game between the Knight Riders and the Rajasthan Royals, Ganguly made his second T20 half century, scoring 51runs off of 39balls at a strike rate of 130.76. In his innings, Ganguly hit four 4s and two sixes, topping the scorers list for the Knight Riders.|$|E
5|$|Shepard was {{designated}} as {{the commander of the}} first manned Project Gemini mission, but was grounded in 1963 due to Ménière's disease, an inner-ear ailment that caused episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea. This was surgically corrected in 1969, and in 1971, Shepard commanded the Apollo 14 mission, piloting the Apollo Lunar Module Antares to the most accurate landing of the Apollo missions. At age 47, he became the fifth and oldest person to walk on the Moon, and {{the only one of the}} Mercury Seven astronauts to do so. During the mission, he hit two golf <b>balls</b> <b>on</b> the lunar surface. He was Chief of the Astronaut Office from November 1963 to July 1969 (the approximate period of his grounding), and from June 1971 until his retirement from the United States Navy and NASA on August 1, 1974. He was promoted to rear admiral on August 25, 1971, the first astronaut to reach that rank.|$|E
5|$|The MCC {{match was}} {{followed}} by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, against Lancashire. Australia were sent in to bat and dismissed for 204, with Bradman bowled by an arm ball from Malcolm Hilton for 11, his first score on the tour below 80. The hosts replied with 182 {{and in the second}} innings, Bradman was again dismissed by Hilton, this time for 43 as the tourists reached 4/259 at the end of play. When Hilton came on, Bradman attempted to seize the initiative and hit him out of the attack, but missed his first two <b>balls.</b> <b>On</b> the third ball, he charged out of his crease and swung across the line, missed, fell over and was stumped. Hilton's achievement garnered widespread press attention, particularly in Lancashire.|$|E
5000|$|Not potting {{the free}} ball incurs no penalty, so the striker {{may play a}} snooker using the free ball, gratis. However, if said snooker is {{achieved}} by having the free ball obstructing the <b>ball</b> <b>on,</b> then the strike is a foul and a penalty {{of the value of}} the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> is awarded to the opponent. The reason is that the free ball was to be treated as the <b>ball</b> <b>on,</b> and one cannot snooker a <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> by another <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> (following the same logic that a red cannot snooker another red when red is on). The only exception to this is when there are only two <b>balls</b> remaining <b>on</b> the table, namely pink and black. If the opposition somehow fouled trying to pot pink, and illegitimately snookered the striker with the black, then it is fair for the striker to snooker the opposition [...] "back" [...] with the free blackball.|$|R
50|$|Note that, as {{a natural}} {{corollary}} of the rules, the free ball is always a colour ball. If the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> is a red, then by definition it cannot be snookered via another red, as it merely provides an alternative clean shot with another <b>ball</b> <b>on.</b> If the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> is a red, and is snookered by a colour after a foul, then logically the red is either the final one or all reds are snookered by a colour ball, meaning the free ball {{has to be a}} colour. If the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> is a colour ball that is snookered by a red, a previous red must have been successfully potted; the snooker therefore must be self-inflicted and cannot have occurred {{as the result of a}} foul. If the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> is a colour that is snookered by another colour after a foul, all reds must have been already potted; thus the free ball still has to be a colour ball.|$|R

5|$|The {{first known}} game {{incorporating}} graphics that updated in real time, rather than {{only when the}} player made a move, was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for {{a demonstration of the}} University of Michigan-developed MIDSAC computer at the University of Michigan in 1954. The game, developed over six months by the pair, featured a pool stick controlled by a joystick and a knob, and a full rack of 15 <b>balls</b> <b>on</b> a table seen in an overhead view. The computer calculated the movements of the balls as they collided and moved around the table, disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion. Like previous video games, the pool game was intended primarily to showcase the computing power of the MIDSAC computer.|$|E
5|$|Late on {{the third}} day, Toshack {{was part of a}} rearguard Australian action that minimised England's first innings lead. He came to the crease at 9/403 to {{accompany}} Lindwall, featuring in a 55-run stand and lasting the final 50 minutes until stumps, with Johnston running for him. Australia were 9/457 at stumps, with Lindwall on 76 and Toshack on 12. Lindwall farmed the strike by trying to hit boundaries and twos during the over, but Yardley did not resort to the tactic of setting a deep field to yield a single to Lindwall to get Toshack on strike. Despite Toshack and Johnston's lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike so that he faced most of the <b>balls.</b> <b>On</b> the next morning of play, Toshack did not add to his score before Lindwall was dismissed and Australia ended at 458 in the third over of the day, leaving the tourists 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Toshack did not bowl in the second innings as England made 8/365 and set Australia a target of 404 for victory on the last day. Australia achieved the runs with seven wickets in hand, setting a new world record for the highest successful run-chase in Tests.|$|E

25|$|Strong {{performances}} at club cricket level in Brisbane brought Batticciotto to the Australian U-19 team alongside Mitchell Johnson, Shane Watson and Michael Clarke. He made two appearances in January 2000 during the U-19 World Cup, however he failed at both opportunities. The first, against Ireland's U-19 on 13 January, saw Batticciotto score a first-ball duck. On 20 January, he faced Pakistan U-19, and was dismissed after three balls, again failing to score. Prolific play at club level continued, however, earning Batticciotto the Peter Burge Medal. He played out 2003 in England, playing club cricket and making appearances for Middlesex and Essex Second XIs. He {{played in the}} Lancashire League and East Anglia Premier Leagues through until 2008. Success brought a debut for Queensland on 19 November 2008, against New South Wales.
