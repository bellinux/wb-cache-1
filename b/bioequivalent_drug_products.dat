40|$|The {{principal}} goal of bioequivalence (BE) investigations has crucial {{importance and}} {{has been the subject}} of extensive discussions. BE studies are frequently considered to serve as procedures for sensitive discrimination. The BE investigation should be able to provide methods and conditions sensitively identifying relevant differences between drug products if such differences in fact exist. Alternatively, BE studies can be deemed as surrogates of clinical investigations assessing therapeutic equivalence. <b>Bioequivalent</b> <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> will be provided to patients for their benefits. Both points of view are valid since they represent two aspects of product performance. It has been argued that both should be equally sustained and applied. In practice, however, they collide when regulatory conditions and statements are developed. For instance, some regulators prefer to conduct BE studies following single drug administrations since these conditions are considered to provide the highest sensitivity of discrimination between pharmacokinetic profiles and thus, a product's in-vivo performance. Others suggest that, at least for modified-release products, BE investigations should be performed in the steady state since it represents clinical conditions. Preference for one point of view or the other pervades other regulatory statements including suggestions for subjects to be selected in studies and pharmacokinetic measures to be evaluated. An overview is provided on the disturbing inconsistency of statements within and between regulations. It is argued that harmonization would be highly desirable, and relevant recommendations are offered...|$|E

A retrospective search of <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> registration processes was performed on the Brazilian Government Official Gazette from January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2015.

Twenty-eight physicians within the community were chosen for evaluation relative to acceptance of the new <b>drug</b> <b>product.</b> Data were obtained {{by means of a}} prescription audit of nine retail pharmacies in the community. The time period of the audit consisted of three months prior, and nine months subsequent, to the introduction of the new <b>drug</b> <b>product.</b> A descriptive analysis of the selected pharmaceutical market indicated a seasonal variation in utilization of the class of <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> to which the new <b>drug</b> <b>product</b> belonged. A high degree of substitutability was also indicated for <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> within the special class. A rank-order analysis indicated physician general prescribing frequency and physician class prescribing frequency were positively correlated. Definitions of acceptance of the new <b>drug</b> <b>product</b> were constructed by means of objective criteria. These criteria were implemented by utilizing physician prescribing records, market share information, and a linear, least squares regression equation. Certain physician characteristics were found to be positively correlated with early acceptance of the new <b>drug</b> <b>product.</b> These characteristics pertained to class prescribing frequency, general prescribing frequency, and medical school alma mater location. Pharmacists within the community were selected for evaluation as an alternate source of market information.

40|$|Stricter {{requirements}} on the therapeutic benefit, labelling and manufacturing processes {{should be set}} for <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> manufactured by pharmacies on a semi-industrial scale. In the Netherlands only <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> authorized by the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board or the European Medicines Agency may be sold. In exceptional cases, pharmacies are allowed to manufacture <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> for their own patients. As the volume of manufacturing by pharmacies is decreasing, along with the availability of sufficient experience and suitable equipment in the pharmacies themselves, more and more pharmacies are now turning to dispensing <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> that have been manufactured in other pharmacies, often manufactured on larger scales than is usual for pharmacies. This type of manufacturing by certain pharmacies clearly supplies a need, especially for <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> requiring more complicated manufacturing processes. Exploratory {{research has demonstrated that}} the chemical-pharmaceutical quality of 32 <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> examined complied, in general, with the requirements. However, the labelling was often incomplete, and {{there was a lack of}} administrative discipline; furthermore, the therapeutic benefit of about half of these <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> proved questionable.

Samples were reacted with a commercially available BoNT/A fluorescent substrate derived from the SNAP- 25 sequence. Reaction products were separated by reversed-phase HPLC. The method detected an atypical cleavage pattern {{by one of the}} formulated <b>drug</b> <b>products.</b> IncobotulinumtoxinA produced two cleavage fragments rather than the single fragment typically generated by BoNT/A. Identification confirmed the secondary cleavage at a position corresponding to SNAP- 25 Arg 198 –Ala 199 (normal BoNT/A cleavage is Gln 197 –Arg 198). Arg 198 –Ala 199 is also the cleavage site for trypsin and serotype C toxin. Normal cleavage was observed for all other BoNT/A <b>drug</b> <b>product</b> samples, as well as 900 -kD and 150 -kD bulk toxin BoNT/A. The reason for this unexpected secondary cleavage pattern by one formulated BoNT/A <b>drug</b> <b>product</b> is unknown. Possible explanations include a contaminating protease and/or damage to the 150 -kD type-A toxin causing nonspecific substrate recognition and subsequent cleavage uncharacteristic of type-A toxin. The BoNT/A <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> were also analyzed via the LCA-HPLC assay using a commercial BoNT/C fluorescent substrate derived from the syntaxin sequence.
