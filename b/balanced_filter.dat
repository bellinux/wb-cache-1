40|$|Abstract —In this paper, {{a compact}} low-temperature-ceramic-cofired balun with two near-passband {{transmission}} zeros is presented. The closed-form design formula are derived {{based on the}} passband impedance match and open-stub reactance variation. A LTCC 2. 4 -GHz balun is implemented with a seventeen-layer commercial low-temperature-ceramic-cofire process. The measured insertion loss is small than 1. 5 dB and return loss is better than 15 dB between 2. 4 and 2. 5 GHz. In the passband, the amplitude imbalance is less than 0. 3 dB and the phase balance is within 4 ˚. Two transmission zeros are measured at 1. 5 GHz and 3. 5 GHz, which enhance the stop-band rejection. The measurement results agree very well with the 3 D simulation, showing the proposed dewsign has great potential in high-performance LTCC <b>balanced</b> <b>filter</b> design.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} {{for the implementation of}} balanced ultra-wideband (UWB) bandpass filters with common-mode noise suppression. To a first-order approximation, the differential-mode filter response is described by the canonical circuit model of a bandpass filter, i. e., a cascade of series-connected resonators alternating with shunt-connected parallel resonant tanks. Thus, the series branches of the <b>balanced</b> <b>filter</b> are implemented by means of inductive strips and patch capacitors, whereas the shunt sections are realized through mirrored stepped-impedance resonators (SIRs) and low-impedance (i. e., capacitive) short transmission-line sections. For the differential mode, the symmetry plane is a virtual ground, the wide strip sections of the SIRs are effectively grounded, and the SIRs behave as grounded inductors parallel connected to capacitors. However, for the common mode, where the symmetry plane is an open (magnetic wall), the SIRs act as shunt-connected series resonators, thus providing transmission zeros at their resonance frequencies. By properly tailoring the location of these transmission zeros, rejection of the common mode over the differential filter passband can be achieved. To illustrate the potential of the approach, an order- 5 balanced bandpass filter covering the regulated band for UWB communications (3. 1 – 10. 6 GHz) is designed and fabricated. The filter exhibits common-mode rejection above 10 dB over the whole differential filter passband, with differential-mode insertion losses lower than 1. 9 dB and return losses better than 10 dB. Since the proposed design approach is based on planar semi-lumped components, filter size is as small as 10. 5 mm X 7. 6 m...|$|E

The frequency response {{characteristics of the}} <b>balanced</b> SAW <b>filters</b> are governed primarily by their geo-metrical structures.

40|$|Abstract. Dual wavelet {{frames and}} their {{associated}} dual framelet filter banks are often constructed using the oblique extension principle. In {{comparison with the}} construction of tight wavelet frames and tight framelet filter banks, it is indeed quite easy to obtain some particular examples of dual framelet filter banks with or without symmetry from any given pair of low-pass filters. However, such constructed dual framelet filter banks are often too particular to have some desirable properties such as <b>balanced</b> <b>filter</b> supports between primal and dual filters. From {{the point of view of}} both theory and application, it is important and interesting to have an algorithm which is capable of finding all possible dual framelet filter banks with symmetry and with the shortest possible filter supports from any given pair of low-pass filters with symmetry. However, to our best knowledge, this issue has not been resolved yet in the literature and one often has to solve systems of nonlinear equations to obtain nontrivial dual framelet filter banks. Given the fact that the construction of dual framelet filter banks is widely believed to be very flexible, the lack of a systematic algorithm for constructing all dual framelet filter banks in the literature is a little bit surprising to us. In this paper, by solving only small systems of linear equations, we shall completely settle this problem by introducing a step-by-step efficient algorithm to construct all possible dual framelet filter banks with or without symmetry and with the shortest possible filter supports. As a byproduct, our algorithm leads to a simple algorithm for constructing all symmetric tight framelet filter banks with two high-pass filters from a given low-pass filter with symmetry. Examples will be provided to illustrate our algorithm. To explain and to understand better our algorithm and dual framelet filter banks, we shall also discuss some properties of our algorithms and dual framelet filter banks in this paper...|$|E

The proposed filters {{are based on}} electrically small resonators coupled through admittance inverters. For design purposes, the circuit models of the considered resonators are reported.

Thus, for the differential-mode the symmetry plane is an electric wall, and the equivalent circuit for that mode provides dual-band functionality. Conversely, for the common-mode the symmetry plane is a magnetic wall, and the equivalent circuit exhibits a rejection band.

40|$|A {{differential}} (or <b>balanced)</b> bandpass <b>filter</b> {{based on}} open complementary split ring resonators (OCSRRs) coupled through admittance inverters {{is presented in}} this article. Pairs of OCSRRs are symmet- rically placed in a mirror configuration between the strips of the differential line and are modeled by means of two series connected parallel resonators. For the differential (odd) mode, there is a virtual ground at the connecting plane between the OCSRR pairs, and the structure is roughly described by the canonical model of a bandpass filter, consisting of a cascade of shunt resonators coupled through admittance inverters. It is demonstrated that, through a proper design of the OCSRR stages, the common mode noise {{in the vicinity of}} the differential filter pass band can be efficiently suppressed. Due to the differential mode operation of the filter, it is not necessary to incorporate metallic vias to ground the OCSRRs.

Successful countercyclical fiscal policy was prudently undertaken in the crisis but not decisively unwound in its aftermath, leaving behind an unsatisfactory fiscal stance.

40|$|Abstract Several {{techniques}} {{exist for}} mapping the element pigments on painting using the synchrotron light or quasi monochromatic sources. K-edge subtraction technique {{is a well}} known technique and based on discontinuity in the attenuation coefficient due to photoelectric K-edge of the absorbing materials. A couple of filters with slightly different K -edge energies, if are with balanced thicknesses, can isolate spectra in a narrow energy band. Quasi monoenergetic X-rays with a spectral width Ek that is the difference in K-edge energies will be taken by subtracting images or spectral data. Thus by using filter foils with appropriate thicknesses with the K-edge absorption just below and above the K-edge energy of an element allows us evaluating the distribution of that element in whole painting. The aim of this thesis has been application of K-edge subtraction technique to determine pigment composition in paintings by using common X-ray sources with <b>balanced</b> <b>filters.</b> The K-edge digital subtraction technique actually is investigated for estimation of Cadmium element. By choosing the Silver Cadmium and Indium as filter materials with properly thickness and with K-edge energies {{very close to the}} Cadmium element, determination of cadmium content has been presented as qualitative and quantitative result. The technique is tested by using a RadEye 200 CMOS sensor. Theoretical simulations considering the experimental setup of technique has been presented as preliminary investigation. Complementary analyses are preformed with micro X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (μXRF), in order to validate the technique for cadmium element with the same samples. Theoretical aspects of K-edge imaging, the algorithms used for elaboration of images, detailed information for cadmium pigments and samples tests, are described in first chapters. An evaluation of X-ray performance of RadEye 200 CMOS sensor has been performed in terms of MTF, NPS and DQE. Preliminary theoretical simulation is performed to determine the range where KES imaging technique with <b>balanced</b> <b>filters</b> response linear with the element content in paintings. In chapter 5 after description of spectral characteristics of the tungsten X-ray tube with additional K-edge filtering, imaging and steps of elaborating images has been described.
