40|$|Genetic {{networks}} show a broad-tailed {{distribution of}} the number of interaction partners per protein, which is consistent with a power-law. It has been proposed that such <b>broadtailed</b> distributions are observed because they confer robustness against mutations to the network. We evaluate this hypothesis for two genetic networks, that of the E. coli core intermediary metabolism and that of the yeast protein-interaction network. Specifically, we test the hypothesis through one of its key predictions: highly-connected proteins should be more important to the cell, and thus subject to more severe selective and evolutionary constraints. We find, however, that no correlation between highlyconnected proteins and evolutionary rate exists in the E. coli metabolic network and that there is only a weak correlation in the yeast protein-interaction network. Furthermore, we show that the observed correlation is function-specific within the protein-interaction network: only genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription show significant correlations. Our work sheds light on conflicting results by previous researchers by comparing data from multiple types of protein-interaction datasets and by using a closely related species as a reference taxon. The finding that highly-connected proteins can tolerate just as many amino acid substitutions as other proteins leads us to conclude that power-laws in cellular networks do not reflect selection for mutational robustness...|$|R

50|$|A karakul (or qaraqul) hat (Pashto/Persian: قراقلی) is a hat {{made from}} the fur of the Qaraqul breed of sheep, often from the fur of aborted lamb foetuses. The {{triangular}} hat {{is part of the}} costume of the native people of Kabul which has been worn by many generations of men in Afghanistan. The fur from which it is made is referred to as Astrakhan, <b>broadtail,</b> qaraqulcha, or Persian lamb. Qaraqul means black fur in Turkic, similar types of hats are common among Turkic peoples. The hat is peaked, and folds flat when taken off of the wearer's head.|$|E
5000|$|Galanos {{was also}} {{famous for his}} {{exquisite}} furs. He used mainly mink, sable, lynx and <b>broadtail</b> and handled the furs imaginatively, {{as if they were}} fabric. He smocked and quilted the surfaces, nipped the waistlines and used drawstrings, ruffles and capelets to give a strong fashion slant to all that opulence. He often designed for Peter Dion, the furrier who made sure that the quality of the pelts and the workmanship supported the innovative design. At the top of the line were coats made of lynx bellies, so soft and fluffy they looked airborne. The short style was selling for $200,000, the long one - for $300,000. The fitted coat was a Galanos specialty, successful in almost any fur, including fox. As he did with his ready-to-wear, Galanos also made the hats and other accessories, which included short fur scarves with mink tails hanging from the ends. He showed his coats over stretch tights and bodysuits with satin surfaces. There were unexpected styles as well, like fur shorts, gathered down the sides. Many sleeves featured the smock quilting that became a Galanos signature. He also had a special feeling for <b>broadtail,</b> the tissue-thin fur with a sleek, elegant surface. But Galanos could also make soft mink coats look lean, willowy and graceful by the way he shaped the skins in the back or carved the hemline in a back-dipping curve. According to Bernardine Morris of the New York Times, Galanos' [...] "best design is a slender coat with the skins worked vertically through the bodice and horizontally for the skirt, an example of elegant proportioning." ...|$|E
50|$|The Carolina Herrera Fall 2005 Ready-to-Wear Collection was {{presented}} in the Fashion Week Tents on February 7, 2005 at Bryant Park during Olympus New York Fashion Week. Style.com described the collection as old-world, but not old-fashioned. The collection of 42 looks was 40s inspired, stripped of embellishments with body-conscious ensembles that were chic, but never flashy—a contemporary interpretation of modern power-dressing that maintained a combination of charm and elegance that the designer is heralded for. The collection featured trumpet skirts and tweed hunting suits. The collection's signature patterns included an abstract and a windowpane check. For Fall 2005, Carolina Herrera trimmed her collection with luxurious accents of lynx, chinchilla, and <b>broadtail.</b> Daria Werbowy opened and closed the runway presentation. Karen Elson, Gemma Ward, Isabeli Fontana, Raquel Zimmerman, Heather Marks, and Liya Kebede also walked the show.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{the last}} months of the 20th century and into the 21st, while {{collectors}} were stocking their wardrobes with his past glories, van den Akker remained a fashion pacesetter. He served as one of four guest critics of future fashion designers at the Fashion Institute of Technology exhibit entitled White Noise. The 1999 segment of the spirited annual student show at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York, interpreted the psychological concept of white noise with 30 garments for adults and children. Despite PETA's protests of his use of fur in coutourier collections, he, along with Oscar de la Renta and Valentino, continued to design for New York-based furrier Alixandre by applying <b>broadtail,</b> fox, lynx, mink, sable and sheared beaver to winter fashions. Van den Akker's spring/summer line for 2001 perpetuated his tradition of fabric collage and appliquéd couture in softly draping shapes to flatter the figure.|$|E
50|$|Very {{young or}} even fetal Karakul lambs are prized for pelts. Newborn karakul sheep pelts are called karakul (also spelled caracul), swakara (coined from South West Africa Karakul), {{astrakhan}} (Russian), Persian lamb, agnello di Persia, (Italian), krimmer (Russian) and garaköli bagana (Turkmen). Sometimes the terms for newborn lambs' and fetal lambs' pelts are used interchangeably. The newborn lambs have a tight, curly pattern of hair. The lambs must be under three days old {{when they are}} killed, or they will lose their black color and soft, tightly wound coils of fur. Dark colors are dominant and lambs often darken in color as they age. Fetal karakul lamb pelts are called <b>broadtail,</b> Breitschwanz (German), and karakulcha. Fetal karakul lambs are harvested through miscarriages, induced early delivery or by killing the mother sheep and removing the fetus. Rather than killing healthy female sheep, farmers will kill older sheep that have already given birth many times. People use the lamb pelts to create various clothing items, such as The Astrakhan (hat) or karakul hat. The pelts have also been used in haute couture.|$|E

40|$|Persistent organochlorines, such as {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} {{including}} coplanar congeners and DDT compounds were {{measured in the}} liver of different species of mollusc cephalopods: <b>broadtail</b> squid (Illex coindetii), horned octopus (Eledone moschata) and spider octopus (Octopus salutii) collected in two {{different areas of the}} Adriatic Sea (central and southern Adriatic Sea). The concentration of PCBs exceeded DDT ones in horned octopus (PCBs: 617. 0 ngg(- 1) lipid weight, DDTs: 188. 0 ngg(- 1) lipid weight) and in spider octopus (PCBs: 590. 0 ngg(- 1) lipid weight, DDTs: 293. 0 ngg(- 1) lipid weight), while in <b>broadtail</b> squid PCB load (748. 0 ngg(- 1) lipid weight) was similar to those of DDTs (514. 5 ngg(- 1) lipid weight). No significant difference in PCB levels was observed among species, while DDT concentrations were higher in <b>broadtail</b> squid than in horned octopus and spider octopus. DDTs composition showed slight differences in relation to species, thought p,p'-DDE was the predominant compound in all cephalopod species (<b>broadtail</b> squid: 88. 1 %, horned octopus 94. 1 %, spider octopus: 97. 5 %). PCB isomer profiles were similar among species being hexachlorinated isomers the most abundant, followed by penta- and heptachlorobiphenyls, while tri- and tetrachlorobiphenyls made up {{a small percentage of the}} total PCB residues. Regarding coplanar congeners, non-ortho PCBs were below the detection limit in all samples and the 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations were very low.

40|$|Cadmium {{concentrations}} were {{measured in the}} flesh and hepatopancreas (digestive gland) of 1, 392 specimens of different species of cephalopod molluscs (<b>broadtail</b> squid, spider octopus, curled octopus, homed octopus, elegant cuttlefish, and pink cuttlefish) to determine whether maximum levels fixed by the European Commission were exceeded. In all species, mean cadmium {{concentrations were}} higher in hepatopancreas than in flesh. Large differences among the different species were also observed. Pink cuttlefish and spider octopus had the highest concentrations for both flesh (spider octopus, 0. 77 mug g(- 1); pink cuttlefish, 0. 87 mug g(- 1)) and hepatopancreas (spider octopus, 9. 65 mug g(- 1); pink cuttlefish, 18. 03 mug g(- 1)), and the lowest concentrations were encountered in <b>broadtail</b> squid (flesh, 0. 13 mug g(- 1); hepatopancreas, 2. 48 mug g(- 1)). The other species had intermediate concentrations of 0. 20 to 0. 30 mug g(- 1) in flesh and 5. 46 to 8. 01 mug g(- 1) in hepatopancreas. Concentrations exceeding the limit proposed by the European Commission (1. 00 mug g(- 1)) were observed in 44. 4 and 40. 0 % of flesh samples of spider octopus and pink cuttlefish, respectively. The estimated weekly intake, 0. 09 to 0. 66 mug/kg body weigh, was below the {{provisional tolerable weekly intake}} set by the World Health Organization...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterize whole raw cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) and shortfin squid (Illex coindetii) during storage in ice through sensory, microbiological, chemical and physical analyses. The recently developed Quality Index Method (QIM) tables for these species were used for sensory analysis. Shelf-life of whole cuttlefish and shortfin squid were estimated as around 10 and 9 days, respectively, according to QIM, which is shorter than for most species, especially fish. The numbers of microorganisms found in cuttlefish and shortfin squid surfaces until rejection were lower than in fish, which suggest predominance of enzymatic (autolytic) degradation. H 2 S-producing bacteria constituted a significant proportion of the spoilage flora. Physical analysis performed using the RT-Freshmeter and the Torrymeter showed these instruments can be applied to cuttlefish and shortfin squid, providing useful complementary information on the rates of change of electrical properties. Free tryptophan and VBN contents significantly changed during the first storage week indicating that low levels of these compounds could be used as indicators of fresh and high quality cuttlefish and <b>broadtail</b> shortfin squid. Urea can be useful as spoilage indicator for cuttlefish, as well as agmatine for <b>broadtail</b> shortfin squid. An overall look into data obtained shows, as expected, that spoilage of these cephalopod species can be considered a different phenomena when compared to fish and is not yet completely clarified...|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of a wide monitoring programme on the presence of heavy metals in marine organisms caught in the South Adriatic Sea, cadmium and total mercury concentrations were determined in flesh and hepatopancreas of 512 specimens of two species of cephalopods. The aim {{of the study was to}} establish the quality of the marine food with respect of the health of consumers and to investigate cadmium and mercury distribution in organisms representing different habitats. For both elements, higher levels were found in spider octopus (octopus salutii) than in <b>broadtail</b> squid (Illex coindeti). Between the two different tissues analysed, higher concentrations were observe in hepatopancreas than flesh.
