5|$|In {{addition}} to working steadily in motion pictures for another 20 years, Calleia also {{starred in the}} 1948 London stage premiere of Arthur Miller's Tony Award-winning play All My Sons, receiving unanimous critical acclaim.

5000|$|The Petite Symphonie Concertante of 1944/45 made Martin's {{international}} reputation, {{and is the}} <b>best</b> known <b>of</b> <b>his</b> orchestral works, as {{the early}} Mass is the <b>best</b> known <b>of</b> <b>his</b> choral compositions, and the Jedermann monologues for baritone and piano or orchestra the <b>best</b> known <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works for solo voice. Other Martin pieces include a full-scale symphony (1936-1937), two piano concertos, a harpsichord concerto, a violin concerto, a cello concerto, a concerto for seven wind instruments, {{and a series of}} six one-movement works he called [...] "ballades" [...] for various solo instruments with piano or orchestra.|$|R

5|$|After {{the date}} of the writ of {{election}} and at least two clear days before nomination day, a candidate or prospective candidate must provide the Registrar of Political Donations with a report stating all the donations received from permissible donors that amount to at least $10,000 received during the 12 months preceding the declaration mentioned in the next sentence. He must also submit to the Registrar a declaration stating, to the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> knowledge and belief, that he did not receive any other donations required to be mentioned in the donation report, and that only donations from permissible donors or allowable anonymous donations were accepted. If this paperwork is in order, the Registrar will issue a political donation certificate not later than the eve of nomination day stating that the candidate has complied with the provisions of the Act.|$|E
5|$|As {{indicated}} above, it {{was through}} the writings of Dares the Phrygian that the portrayal of Troilus as an important warrior was transmitted to medieval times. However, some authors {{have argued that the}} tradition of Troilus as a warrior may be older. The passage from the Iliad described above is read by Boitani as implying that Priam put Troilus {{on a par with the}} very <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> warrior sons. The description of him in that passage as hippiocharmên is rendered by some authorities as meaning a warrior charioteer rather than merely someone who delights in horses. The many missing and partial literary sources might include such a hero. Yet only the one ancient vase shows Troilus as a warrior falling in a conventional battle.|$|E
5|$|Jinnah was {{the central}} figure of the 1998 film Jinnah, {{which was based on}} Jinnah's life and his {{struggle}} for the creation of Pakistan. Christopher Lee, who portrayed Jinnah, called his performance the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career. The 1954 Hector Bolitho's book Jinnah: Creator of Pakistan prompted Fatima Jinnah to release a book, titled My Brother (1987), as she thought that Bolitho's book had failed to express the political aspects of Jinnah. The book received positive reception in Pakistan. Jinnah of Pakistan (1984) by Stanley Wolpert is {{regarded as one of the}} best biographical books on Jinnah.|$|E

In the first season, Lana and Clark's {{friendship}} is just beginning, as she is dating Whitney Fordman during this time. After Whitney leaves for the Marines in the season one finale, Lana and Clark slowly begin to try to start a romantic relationship. In season seven, Lana leaves Smallville, leaving behind a DVD explaining to Clark that, even though she loves him, {{the only way for}} him to help the world to the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ability would be if she left him and Smallville for good.|$|E
5|$|Prescott's main {{secondary}} {{source for}} the history was Leopold von Ranke's Fürste und Völker von Süd-Europa im sechzehnten und siebzehnten Jahrhundert, a comprehensive work which included a detailed history of the papacy. Prescott admired Ranke's empirical historical method, and considered his work to be the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> predecessors on the subject. He had four copies of the relevant sections of the work reprinted in a large typeface so he could read it without assistance. He had made a broad plan of the work by February 1849. Prescott started writing the draft on July 26. At this time, Prescott was a creditor of John White Webster, the chemist and murderer, and he was subsequently involved in his trial.|$|E
5|$|Seamer {{played the}} <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cricket while at Oxford University. All {{four of his}} {{first-class}} centuries were made for the university side, and his average for Oxford was 35.30, significantly higher than his career average of 20.35. He made his highest score against Free Foresters in his second year, during which he accrued 858 runs, more than double he managed in any other season. On completion of his studies at Oxford, Seamer joined the Sudan Political Service, which limited his first-class cricket appearances to periods of leave. He was named as one of three amateurs to captain Somerset in 1948, leading the team during June and July. That season was his last for Somerset, and he made only one further first-class appearance. He became a district commissioner in the Sudan, and after leaving the service, he taught at Marlborough College and was twice mayor of Marlborough.|$|E

5|$|Sold for US$300,000 to a {{breeding}} syndicate led by Leslie Combs II, Shannon was retired to stud duty and stood alongside another Australian champion Bernborough at Combs' Spendthrift Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, {{where he had}} a successful career as a sire. Eleven of his first crop yearlings averaged $11,755 each. The <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> progeny were Clem ($535,681) who defeated Round Table in track record time in the Washington Park Handicap, and Sea O Erin ($407,259), who won the Citation Handicap and 18 other races.

5|$|Thompson was a {{stand-up}} goaltender, rarely falling on both knees {{to stop a}} puck. He {{was one of the}} first NHL goaltenders to catch the puck with his hand to make a save, and helped popularize the technique. Using gloves that were smaller than those of other players, he was among the best puck-catchers of his era. He stood in the way of the puck with minimal padding, risking being struck when moving to catch it instead of simply deflecting it away from the net. His signature technique, very often featured in photographs of him, involved dropping to one knee with the paddle of his goalstick covering the five-hole, and extending his glove to cover the left side of the net. Although he caught the puck with his glove, he did so without gloves resembling the modern blocker and trapper glove combination. Thompson was described by Johnny Bower, a former goaltender who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, as a good puckhandler, and one of the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time at forward passing. In the 1935–36 season, Thompson became the first goaltender to get an assist by intentionally passing the puck with his stick to a fellow player.|$|E
5|$|When Thorpe {{broke the}} 200m {{freestyle}} Olympic {{record in the}} heats the following morning, his main rival Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands (with World No. 2 ranked and teammate Michael Kim bypassing the 200 metres) conceded defeat. However, van den Hoogenband showed {{his hand in the}} semi-finals by cutting more than a second off his personal best, to set a new world record of 1min 45.35s. Thorpe qualified second with a personal <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own, 0.02s slower, and was under immense pressure to win the final the following day after his double gold on the first night. Van den Hoogenband started quickly and Thorpe chased him, reaching the 100m mark just 0.04s behind. Both swimmers turned at 150m in identical times. As a result of starting harder than usual, Thorpe faded as van den Hoogenband drew away to claim gold and equal his world record, stunning the home crowd. Thorpe touched in 1min 45.83s, {{the first time that he}} had swum slower in the final than in the qualifying rounds. Thorpe though would never again lose to Van Den Hoogenband in a long course 200 metres race again. Thorpe returned to victory when he led off the 4×200m freestyle relay the following night, setting up a 10m lead over American Scott Goldblatt in the first leg. Although Thorpe was unable to reclaim the individual world record, he, Klim, Kirby and Todd Pearson lowered their world record to 7min 07.05s, over five seconds ahead of the Americans—the largest winning margin in an Olympic relay for half a century. Thorpe rounded off his Olympics by swimming in the heats of the 4×100m medley relay, and collected a silver medal when the finals quartet finished behind the Americans. Thorpe's performances as Australia's leading medalist for the Games were recognised when the Australian Olympic Committee granted him the honour of carrying the flag at the closing ceremony. With three gold and two silver medals, Thorpe was the most successful athlete at the 2000 Olympic Games. At year's end, he was again named by Swimming Australia as the Swimmer of the Year, but van den Hoogenband usurped him as the leading male swimmer chosen by Swimming World Magazine.|$|E
