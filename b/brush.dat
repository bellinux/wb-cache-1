40|$|Oral biofilm {{is inevitably}} left behind, even after powered <b>brushing.</b> As a special feature, powered <b>brushing</b> removes biofilm in a noncontact mode. When the <b>brushing</b> {{distance}} becomes too large, biofilm is left behind. We hypothesize that biofilm left behind after <b>brushing</b> has different viscoelastic properties than before <b>brushing,</b> impacting antimicrobial penetration. In vitro grown dual-species biofilms {{were subjected to}} 20 % mechanical deformation before and after powered <b>brushing</b> at 4 -mm <b>brushing</b> distance. Biofilm thickness and stress relaxation were measured for unbrushed and <b>brushed</b> biofilms. Stress relaxation was analyzed with a three-element Maxwell model. Antimicrobial penetration from five mouthrinses was microscopically evaluated for unbrushed and <b>brushed</b> biofilms. Thicknesses of unbrushed and <b>brushed</b> biofilms were similar. <b>Brushing</b> decreased the prevalence of fast and increased the prevalence of slow relaxation elements, which was accompanied by deeper penetration of chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride. Penetration of antimicrobials from other mouthrinses was relatively low in unbrushed and <b>brushed</b> biofilms. This confirmation of our hypothesis points to an additional advantage of powered toothbrushing in a noncontact mode, changing the viscoelastic properties of biofilm {{in a direction that}} increases antimicrobial penetration of chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium. The biofilm left behind after noncontact powered toothbrushing may have less recalcitrance toward penetration of chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride than prior to <b>brushing...</b>|$|R

40|$|Toothbrushing, though {{aimed at}} biofilm removal, also affects the lubricative {{function}} of adsorbed salivary conditioning films (SCFs). Different modes of <b>brushing</b> (manual, powered, rotary-oscillatory or sonically driven) influence the SCF in different ways. Our objectives were to compare boundary lubrication of SCFs after different modes of <b>brushing</b> and {{to explain their}} lubrication {{on the basis of}} their roughness, dehydrated layer thickness, and degree of glycosylation. A pilot study was performed to relate in vitro lubrication with mouthfeel in human volunteers. Coefficient of friction (COF) on 16 -h-old SCFs after manual, rotary-oscillatory, and sonically driven <b>brushing</b> was measured using colloidal probe atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM was also used to assess the roughness of SCFs prior to and after <b>brushing.</b> Dehydrated layer thicknesses and glycosylation of the SCFs were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Mouthfeel after manual and both modes of powered <b>brushing</b> were evaluated employing a split-mouth design. Compared with unbrushed and manually or sonically driven <b>brushed</b> SCFs, powered rotary-oscillatory <b>brushing</b> leads to deglycosylation of the SCF, loss of thickness, and a rougher film. Concurrently, the COF of a powered rotary-oscillatory <b>brushed</b> SCF increased. Volunteers reported a slightly preferred mouthfeel after sonic <b>brushing</b> as compared to powered rotating-oscillating <b>brushing.</b> Deglycosylation and roughness increase the COF on SCFs. Powered rotary-oscillatory <b>brushing</b> can deglycosylate a SCF, leading to a rougher film surface as compared with manual and sonic <b>brushing,</b> decreasing the lubricative function of the SCF.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} different statistical approaches in finding {{a statistically significant difference}} in plaque removal efficiency between <b>brushes</b> in clinical trials. Materials and Methods: The approaches, which are evaluated, concern the scores after <b>brushing</b> only, the difference in scores before and after <b>brushing</b> and the relative difference scores (i. e. score before minus score after <b>brushing</b> divided by the score before <b>brushing).</b> In each case the scores before <b>brushing</b> may be included as a covariate. Except for the relative difference scores, the power of the test statistics of the approaches has been compared by assuming a simple statistical model. These theoretical results have been compared with the numerical results of two particular clinical trials - one with a between-subject design and one with a within-subject design. Results: The numerical results of these clinical trials show that the calculated p-values support the conclusions drawn from the statistical model, i. e. the power of the F-test is highest when evaluating the data after <b>brushing</b> with the data before <b>brushing</b> included as a covariate. Using the differences in scores before and after <b>brushing</b> - again with the data before <b>brushing</b> as a covariate - does not add additional power to the test. Omitting the data before <b>brushing</b> as a covariate only gives satisfactory results when the variance over the subjects or the error variance is zero, which in general is not the case. Conclusions: This investigation reveals that in general the approach of analysing the scores after <b>brushing</b> with the scores before <b>brushing</b> as a covariate yields the highest chance of finding a statistically significant difference between two <b>brushes.</b> © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2005...|$|R
