Like many margins, the edge effect ‘high ’ offshore Gabon. West Africa {{is located at the}} shelf break in the region of maximum sediment thickness. Gabon differs, however, from other margins in that the edge effect ‘low ’ is displaced from over the continental rise to the slope. The origin of the low has been investigated by backstripping the sediments at the margin. We have used the <b>backstrip</b> to calculate the amount of crustal thinning, assuming Airy isostasy. Such a model implies zero strength during rifting. Alternatively, this amount of crustal thinning can be explained by a strong margin and a depth of necking that exactly balances the upward and downward forces that act on the crust during rifting. We have developed a method, which takes into account variations in the strength during rifting and the depth of necking, to compute the thinning directly from the sediment <b>backstrip.</b> The <b>backstrip</b> and the crustal thinning have been used to calculate the rifting gravity anomaly. Differences between the <b>backstrip</b> and the present-day water depth give the geometry of the sediment load and hence, the contribution to the gravity anomaly of sedimentation.

40|$|Simulation of {{stratigraphy}} {{coupled with}} sequence stratigraphic and <b>backstripping</b> analysis quantitatively defines {{the timing and}} magnitude of geologic events, including the history of sediment supply, tectonism and eustasy. This provides a quantitative basis for interpreting the mechanisms causing these variations. This computer simulation comprises algorithms that model subsidence and uplifts, eustasy, flexural response of sediment and water loads, compaction, traction- and suspension-load deposition, gravity-flow sedimentation, carbonate production and redistribution, and erosion. <b>Backstripping</b> analysis can provide a geohistory, burial history, sediment accumulation history, porosity history, and a first approximation of the tectonic subsidence or uplift history. A <b>backstripping</b> analysis of a stratigraphic section produced by the two-dimensional simulator demonstrates the error due to overcompensating for the flexural response to sediment loading with a calculation that assumes local isostasy. These errors reinforce the necessity to use a two- or three-dimensional simulation or <b>backstripping</b> technique to accurately define the eustatic and tectonic history of a region. Simulation results of the Last Chance Canyon study show that documented stratal patterns are {{a product of the}} interaction of a dynamic depositional system, with constant parameters, fed by alternating siliciclastic sand and carbonate production, a constant subsidence rate of 0. 4 cm/ky, and a eustatic sea-level history that contains "third-order" and higher periodicity cycles. A hierarchy of stratigraphic packaging is presented that include continental encroachment megasequences, transgressive-regressive facies-supersequences, complete and incomplete sequences, component groups and components. Sediment supply, tectonism, and eustatic fluctuations produce these packages by changing the accommodation space with characteristic rates and patterns. The geometry of the substrate and bathymetric changes strongly influence the geometry of stratal surfaces and distribution of lithofacies. The response of these variables is simulated independently to identify their unique stratal signatures. Examples from different settings (passive margin, mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sediment supplies, carbonate ramp, and steep carbonate platform margin, and others) demonstrate how siliciclastic and carbonate depositional systems interact with the bathymetric conditions produced by these variables.

40|$|Several {{sedimentary}} basins in Africa {{are classified}} as intracratonic basins, but no conclusive formation mechanism has been identified for these basin types. Tectonic subsidence curves may help in unraveling formation mechanisms or identify tectonic forcing for these basins. This thesis presents and analyses basin subsidence curves for basins {{in the interior of}} Africa and near its passive margins. A <b>backstripping</b> program has been written to solve the <b>backstripping</b> equations needed to make the tectonic subsidence curves from the well data. Results of <b>backstripping</b> 77 wells from 13 basins in Africa are presented. The results are interpreted to identify phases of fast and slow tectonic subsidence and it is investigated whether these can be related to plate tectonic events from the Cambrian to the present. The tectonic subsidence curves of the Ghadames, Illizi, Timimoun, Algeria Regional, Murzuq, Al Kufrah, Iullemmeden, (Upper Egypt), Taoudeni and Zaire basins largely characterize intracratonic basins, Chad and partly Upper Egypt resemble rift basins, and Mozambique and Tanzania Coastal show strong similarity to passive margin basins. The results of the correlations show that the tectonic subsidence curves of the Tanzania Coastal and Mozambique passive margin basins can be correlated to the Africa-Antarctica break-up initiated at 176 Ma (Tanzania Coastal Basin) and to the India-Madagascar break-up at 90 Ma (Mozambique Basin). Many of the North African intracratonic basins show indications that can be correlated to tectonic events occurring at the margins of Africa, i. e. the Hercynian Unconformity and Alpine events. But there are no very clear signals of how far into the plate interior these events have affected the basins. </p...|$|R
40|$|Widely {{accepted}} basin forming {{mechanisms are}} limited to flexure of the lithosphere, and lithospheric stretching followed by cooling and thermal subsidence. Neither of these mechanisms works {{for a group of}} large basins, sometimes known as “intracontinental sags”. In this paper we investigate cooling and thickening of initially thin lithosphere as a basin forming mechanism, by a combination of forward modelling and a <b>backstripping</b> study of two Palaeozoic North African basins: Ghadames and Al Kufrah. These are two of a family of basins, once unified, which lie over the largely accretionary crust of North Africa and Arabia. Such accretionary crust tends to be juvenile, consisting of amalgamated island arcs, accretionary prisms and melanges, and typically has near-normal crustal thicknesses but initially thin mantle lithosphere. Post-accretion subsidence is modelled using a plate cooling model similar to cooling models for oceanic lithosphere. The crustal composition and thickness used in the models are varied around average values of accretionary crust to represent likely heterogeneity. The model allows the lithosphere to thicken as it cools and calculates the resulting isostatic subsidence. Water-loaded tectonic subsidence curves from these forward models are compared to tectonic subsidence curves produced from <b>backstripped</b> wells from Al Kufrah and Ghadames Basins. A good match between the subsidence curves for the forward model and <b>backstripping</b> is produced when the best estimates for the crustal structure, composition and the present day thickness of the lithosphere for North Africa are used as inputs for the forward model. The model produces sediment loaded basins of 2 – 7 km thickness for the various crustal assemblies over ~ 250 Myr. This shows that lithospheric cooling provides a viable method for producing large basins with prolonged subsidence, without the need for initial extension, provided the condition of initially thin mantle lithosphere is met...|$|R

A genetic stratigraphic approach has been used in this research on the evolution and syndepositional tectonics of the Transvaal Sea; research also emphasized the development of basement precursors, which influenced the Transvaal Sea. Eight subfacies were initially recognized and their interrelationships through Transvaal Sea time and space were used to identify ten depositional systems. Paleogeographic reconstructions indicate that the depositional systems developed on morphological variations of a distally-steepened carbonate rarp and that the depositional character of each was simply a function of water <b>Backstripping</b> of the depositional systems indicates that the Transvaal Sea was compartmentalized; three compartments are preserved on the Kaapvaal Craton. <b>Backstripping</b> also indicates that the depositional center of the Transvaal Sea lay over the western margin of an underlying rift.

40|$|The Williston Basin {{is one of}} {{a number}} of North American intracratonic basins whose {{subsidence}} is poorly understood. The Basin is circular in shape and contains nearly 5 km of preserved sedimentary rocks at its center; ranging from Cambrian to Tertiary in age. The Basin's subsidence is investigated quantitatively using the <b>backstripping</b> method in order to gain a better understanding of its origin. Data from 24 oil exploration wells located in central and northwest portions of the basin were correlated and used in the study. A computer program called UNPAK was developed to perform the <b>backstripping</b> analysis. Tectonic subsidence curves were calculated to evaluate episodic subsidence models and extrapolated across unconformities to evaluate continuous subsidence models. Extrapolated tectonic subsidence curves near the center of the basin display a relatively constant subsidence through the Paleozoic, at a rate of slightly less than 1 cm ka- 1, and then decrease to the present-day. Improbable behavior of subsidence curves was used to constrain the magnitude of the eustatic models used in the <b>backstripping</b> calculations. A Cambro-Ordovician first-order rise of between 100 and 160 m, and a Cretaceous first-order rise of approximately 150 m above present-day sea level are consistent with the stratigraphic record in the Basin. No bathymetric corrections were used in the <b>backstripping</b> calculations, however, results from this study indicate water depth during deposition of the Bakken Formation was probably in the range of 50 to 100 m. Calculated point-loads necessary to account for the deflection of the Basin (using an elastic plate model) ranged from 2. 5 x 1018 N to 2. 9 x 1018 N, for an episodic model. If a continuous subsidence model was invoked, then a load of between 5. 3 x 1018 N and 6. 5 x 1018 N is required to account for the deflection of the Basin. Of the previously proposed models to account for the basin's subsidence, continuous subsidence models were favored. A phase-change model, involving progressive metamorphic reactions of gabbro to eclogite, seemed the most likely of these models. Evidence in favor of the continuous subsidence models includes: an excellent fit of the extrapolated tectonic subsidence data to a smooth curve (implying a single subsidence mechanism); an axis of sedimentation which shifted in a circular fashion around a relatively stationary center of deposition; very close correspondence between unconformities in the basin and falls in second-order relative changes in sea level from published curves; and evidence for uplift and erosion of the surrounding cratonic arches in between depositional cycles. Future acceptance of a continuous subsidence model to explain the Williston Basin's subsidence will ultimately depend upon the outcome of the debate surrounding the existence and origin of short-term eustatic changes...|$|R
40|$|The Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea are {{connected}} via the Davis Strait. As a bathymetric high {{of less than}} 700 m water depth, the Davis Strait is an obstacle for the water transport between the northern latitudes and the Atlantic Ocean. For climate models of the past, the heat transport by ocean currents plays a major role. Bathymetric models are therefore essential to understand past ocean-current developments. By <b>backstripping</b> of the sediments, calculation of thermal subsidence of the crust, and rotation in a plate kinematic model we obtained the paleo-bathymetry of the Davis Strait area, including the northern Labrador Sea. The grids are calculated for time steps from Eocene to Cretaceous. For these calculations we collected interpretations of seismic data and drill sites to combine these with our new seismic data.

The paleo-location of the profiles and the age structure of the crust, which is needed for the thermal subsidence calculations, are derived from our recent plate kinematic model.
