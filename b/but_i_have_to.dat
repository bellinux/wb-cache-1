5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> admit that the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of}} the performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E

Alonso stayed in Merseyside to be at her side while she gave birth, later saying, [...] "It was a little frustrating to miss the match against Inter <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be with my family at times like these." [...] His decision to place his family ahead of a Champions League tie caused much friction with former manager Rafael Benítez. On 30 March 2010, they had their second child, a girl named Ane Alonso Aranburu. Their third child and second daughter, Emma Alonso Aranburu, was born on 2 December 2013.|$|E

When I was told of the characterization of ‘Kalabhairava’, I had an impression of a young, passionate soldier and naturally it had to have a great body and an authoritative voice. So, we also worked on it. We actually went to Rajasthan and observed the local culture and their way of dressing, we researched a lot about their costumes, history and great personalities 400 years ago and planned it accordingly." [...] Ram Charan sported a long hairdo for both of his characters in the film.|$|E

500|$|TV Guide {{referred}} to Todd as a breakout character. At {{the height of}} his popularity, which was called [...] "Todd-mania" [...] and [...] "the Todd Manning phenomenon", Howarth was disturbed that so many women were attracted to Todd and that the show's writers had begun to redeem the character. [...] In a September 1995 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the publication stated that Howarth was troubled that [...] "his villainous character became such a fan favorite". In October 1995, Howarth told SOD, [...] "People have {{come up to me and}} said, 'My 7-year-old loves you.' What do I say to that? I'm not going to tell them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say, it's disturbing." [...] He gave credit to the show's writers for Todd's popularity, saying that the rapists' trial was well constructed and added, [...] "I think, right now, we're just riding the wave of something that started last summer. Beyond that, I don't really know why people like Todd".|$|E
500|$|The NSC meeting then heard Phillips' bleak {{prognosis}} of {{the situation}} in the Mekong Delta. He claimed that the Strategic Hamlet Program was a shambles in the delta, stating that they were [...] "being chewed to pieces by the Viet Cong". When it was noted that Phillips had recently witnessed a battle in the delta, Kennedy asked Phillips for his assessment. Phillips replied: [...] "Well, I don't like to contradict General Krulak, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tell you, Mr. President, that we're not winning the war, particularly in the delta. The troops are paralysed, they're in the barracks, and this is what is actually going on in one province that's right next to Saigon." [...] Phillips asserted that removing Nhu {{was the only way to}} improve the situation. Phillips asserted that the only means of removing Nhu was to bring in Colonel Edward Lansdale, the CIA operative who had consolidated Diệm's position a decade earlier, a proposal that Kennedy dismissed.

[...] That fall, she later told Billboard about her plans for the album, saying she already envisioned several aspects of it. Perry told the {{magazine}} that she already had songs and ideas, and knew the type of record she would make next. She {{also said that}} although she had not started recording yet, she already knew how the artwork, coloring and tone of the album would turn out. Perry further detailed: [...] "I have to let the music take shape first. I even know what type of tour I'm doing next.

Brennan Carly from Billboard wrote that Madonna seemed [...] "down-to-earth and affable" [...] in the video. Bradley Stern from MuuMuse called the video as La Dolce Vita [...] "through Instagram filters" [...] and found elements of the music video for Madonna's 1998 single, [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love", with the paparazzi shots. He declared the scenes showing Madonna's then-boyfriend Brahim Zaibat, the singer's cleavage and booty slaps as highlights of the video. Stern concluded by saying that he [...] "thought this would be much worse because the concept is so flimsy, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say: It's kind of a treat to see Madonna letting loose and having some fun." [...] Belinda White from The Daily Telegraph wrote that Madonna refused to act [...] "her age" [...] in the video but [...] "she has us {{more than a little}} envious of all the fun she's having, not to mention how incredible she looks." [...] Leslie Price from Pop Dust website found Madonna's getup as similar to actress Brigitte Bardot.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in April 2008, {{the media}} {{reported}} growing speculation that Chris Matthews, news commentator {{and host of}} MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews, might run in the 2010 Democratic primary for the United States Senate Pennsylvania seat then occupied by the Republican Arlen Specter. In an interview with The New York Times Magazine, Matthews said that he believed Specter {{had been in the}} Senate for too long, but that running for Senate would mean giving up a career he loved. Mark Leibovich, author of the article, wrote, [...] "Matthews has been particularly obsessed with Pennsylvania of late, devoting hours on and off the air to the state's upcoming Democratic primary, staying in close contact with the state's party apparatus". Speculation was further fueled by Matthews' appearance on an April 14 episode of The Colbert Report. Host Stephen Colbert asked Matthews about the rumors and prodded him to make a public announcement, to which Matthews replied, [...] "Did you ever want to be something your whole life? ... When you grow up, some kids want to be a fireman. I want to be a Senator. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with these things as they come." [...] Matthews declined to directly answer questions about his possible candidacy when pressed by the media, but did not deny the possibility.|$|E
500|$|MTV {{columnist}} Josh Wigler {{was disappointed}} with the presumed alien storyline and believed {{it to be a}} [...] "weak episode". Despite liking actor Lance Reddick, Wigler was displeased with his character's increased screentime, believing Broyles works better as an [...] "enigmatic figure". Wigler did however praise the villain's [...] "murderous method of choice", writing [...] "Those who've read my Fringe reviews know that I'm not big on the mystery-of-the-week element, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give this episode some credit for at least making it look good." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, noting the [...] "great work" [...] done with the CGI and props {{while at the same time}} acknowledging the opening was not [...] "particularly exciting". Isler praised Reddick's performance, but continued [...] "besides the Broyles characterization, this episode kind of fell flat. The plot unfolds slowly, and the first sixty percent of this episode is kind of a yawner. The only things that really spice up the story are Walter's antics (which are very amusing, as usual). The monster of the week, an alien stowing away in a Russian cosmonaut's body, isn't all that scary or even malevolent (it's just trying to stay alive by feeding on radiation)." ...|$|E

500|$|Following its release, {{multiple}} critics {{found that}} the lyrics alluded to her turbulent high profile relationship with Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person". During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from your feelings, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> understand, and people need to understand, that {{you have to go through}} everything. You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and everyone has been in that situation where you can't help it. Even if it's not even that, it's like love drunk in a way." [...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be? Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?" [...] Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying: [...] "We’re sure there’s some weight to that, but we can’t help but think there’s some hints of Justin Bieber in this track." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{importance}} of rehearsal to Monteux was shown when, in 1923, Diaghilev {{asked him to}} conduct Stravinsky's new Les noces with no rehearsal, as the composer would already have conducted the first performance, Monteux following on from there. Monteux told the impresario [...] "Stravinsky, 'e can do what 'e like, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do what ze composer 'as written." [...] Monteux's self-effacing approach to scores led to occasional adverse comment; the music critic of The Nation, B. H. Haggin, while admitting that Monteux was generally {{regarded as one of}} the giants of conducting, wrote of his [...] "repeatedly demonstrated musical mediocrity". [...] Other American writers have taken a different view. In 1957 Carleton Smith wrote, [...] "His approach to all music is that of the master-craftsman. ... Seeing him at work, modest and quiet, it is difficult to realize that he is a bigger box office attraction at the Metropolitan Opera House than any prima donna ... that he is the only conductor regularly invited to take charge of America's 'big three'– the Boston, Philadelphia and New York Philharmonic orchestras." [...] In his 1967 book The Great Conductors, Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Monteux, [...] " [...] conductor of international stature, a conductor admired and loved all over the world. The word 'loved' is used advisedly." [...] Elsewhere, Schonberg wrote of Monteux's [...] "passion and charisma". When asked in a radio interview to describe himself (as a conductor) in one word, Monteux replied, [...] "Damned professional".|$|E

A new WRC rule for 2007 allowed for Remote Service Zones to be set up away from the main Service Park at Rally HQ. For 15 minutes the cars could be refuelled, re-tyred, and have any necessary maintenance carried out, as long as the parts and tools to do so (except fuel and tyres) were already in the vehicle. For Grönholm this was a major relief. On the previous stage his car had developed an issue with the hydraulic flappy-paddle gearchanges on his steering wheel, which meant he had had to resort to shifting gears manually. The technicians were unsure why or how it had occurred and were hoping that their repairs would last until the car got back to Valence. Loeb won an uneventful , but only by one-tenth of a second ahead of Sordo, and on [...] Sordo was quicker than Loeb, after Loeb stalled on the start-line and was unable to make up the lost seconds. At the midday break, Loeb was lamenting his lead over Sordo. [...] "Now it's a big battle between the two C4s. The other cars for the moment are behind, so it's good news for the team.

500|$|The way Ned Flanders {{prepares the}} cocktails {{at the party}} is similar to actor Tom Cruise's bartending stunts in the 1988 film Cocktail. Songs heard at the party include Tom Jones's [...] "It's Not Unusual" [...] (1965), Dusty Springfield's [...] "The Look of Love" [...] (1967), KC and the Sunshine Band's [...] "That's the Way (I Like It)" [...] (1975), and Glen Campbell's [...] "Wichita Lineman" [...] (1968). Homer's false memory of the party the {{following}} day (in which he imagines himself as being erudite and witty instead of drunk) is {{a reference to the}} Algonquin Round Table, a group of New York City writers, critics, actors, and wits. The [...] "Mexican Hat Dance" [...] song is heard when Marge turns on the radio in the car to mute the conversation between her and Homer so that the children cannot hear them fight. When Homer comes into the church late, while looking for his chair, a character who strikes a resemblance to Adolf Hitler is seen. In a flashback sequence, Bart remembers chasing away a screaming babysitter with the car as a toddler. This sequence and the music in it are references to a scene in the 1976 film The Omen, in which the Devil's child Damien makes animals shriek in terror as Damien approaches. The picture of General Sherman at the bait shop is a reference to the [...] of the Loch Ness Monster. John and Gloria are a reference to George and Martha from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Homer's attempt at catching General Sherman, his bludgeoning of the fish and the line [...] "I love you <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> kill you" [...] are all based on Santiago's fight with the marlin in Ernest Hemingway's novel The Old Man and the Sea. The battle between Homer and General Sherman is also reminiscent of Captain Ahab's battle with the white whale Moby-Dick in the novel Moby-Dick.|$|E
500|$|A {{teenager}} {{struggling to}} find his place in life ever since his parents disappeared {{when he was a}} child. A spider bites him {{on the back of his}} neck, giving him spider-powers. He becomes Spider-Man. Garfield described Parker as someone he can relate to and stated that the character had been an important influence on him since he was little. [...] Garfield drew from his life experiences as inspiration for the role, revealing, [...] "I was thinking of my history and thinking of the kid at school who I wasn't as strong as, who behaved badly to a lot of people– including myself– and who I constantly tried to stand up to but never had the physical prowess to". Discussing his predecessor, Garfield said he respects Tobey Maguire as an actor and that when he first saw Maguire play Spider-Man he [...] "was blown away by his interpretation." [...] Garfield said in interviews, including one in which he was interviewed by Maguire, that when he watched the film Spider-Man when he was younger, he would jokingly recite Maguire's lines in the mirror with a friend who joked that he would never be Spider-Man. On accepting the role Garfield explained, [...] "I see it as a massive challenge in many ways... To make it authentic. To make the character live and breathe in a new way. The audience already has a relationship with many different incarnations of the character. I do, as well. I'm probably going to be the guy in the movie theater shouting abuse at myself. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> let that go. No turning back. And I wouldn't want to." [...] After taking the role, Garfield studied the movements of athletes and spiders and tried to incorporate them, saying Parker is [...] "a boy/spider in terms of how he moves, and not just in the suit." [...] He did yoga and Pilates for the role in order to be as flexible as possible. When first wearing his costume Garfield admitted to shedding tears and trying to imagine [...] "a better actor in the suit", which he described as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] and admitted to wearing nothing beneath it since it is skintight. When filming Garfield explained that he had four months of training and described his physical roles on stunts as terribly challenging and exhausting.|$|E
