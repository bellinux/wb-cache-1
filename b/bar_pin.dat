50|$|Mossberg also markets a less {{expensive}} shotgun under the Maverick Arms name, the Mossberg Maverick 88, in blued finish with synthetic stocks, and in appearance is virtually identical to the 500 model. Maverick and Mossberg shotguns share many interchangeable parts but Maverick shotguns differ in some ways, such as lacking sling swivel studs and having cross-bolt safeties instead of tang safeties, which makes the trigger group non interchangeable with the model 500 shotgun. The one piece forearm can be replaced with OEM or after market parts {{with the addition of}} an action slide tube, as the factory forearm has the action <b>bars</b> <b>pinned</b> into place. The Maverick series also does not come drilled and tapped for rail mounts like the 500 models. There are two basic models of the 88, the 88 field and the 88 security, with a cartridge capacity of 6 or 8 shots, and they cannot have their magazines easily extended without machining. The factory warranty on Maverick shotguns are limited to one year.|$|R

40|$|The South Oculus at Canterbury Cathedral is a {{wrought iron}} space frame {{consisting}} of two layers (Ferramenta and Grille) connected by tie <b>bars</b> (<b>Pins).</b> It is in very good condition despite its almost 850 years of history. The in situ survey of the Cathedral confirmed that the Ferramenta and the external grille are in general in relative good condition {{with the exception of}} some local failures. On the contrary, the pins are the most deteriorated part of the structure. Ambient vibration tests were carried out and the modal response of the structure was identified. In order to assess the safety of the oculus with respect to wind load, a model of the structure was built with the finite element software DIANA and calibrated using the results of the experimental campaign. The non-linear analysis of the existing structure resulted in a safety factor of about ten for the wind load. In addition, parametric studies have highlighted the importance of the external grille for the structure and have provided information of the consequences of further deterioration in terms of the load bearing capacity of the Oculus...|$|R
40|$|Angular {{momentum}} {{transfer from}} a rotating stellar bar {{has been proposed}} by Weinberg & Katz (2002) as a mechanism to destroy dark-matter cusps in a few rotation periods. The N-body simulations performed by these authors in support of their claim employed spherical harmonics for the force computation and were, as shown by Sellwood (2003), very sensitive to inclusion of asymmetric terms (odd l,m). In order to disentangle possible numerical artifacts due to the usage of spherical harmonics from genuine stellar dynamical effects, we performed similar experiments using a tree code and find that significant cusp destruction requires substantially more angular momentum than is realistically available. However, {{we find that the}} simplified model (a N-body halo torqued by a rotating <b>bar</b> <b>pinned</b> to the origin) undergoes an instability in which the cusp moves away from the origin. In presence of this off-centring, spherical density profiles centred on the origin display an apparent cusp-removal. We strongly suspect that it is this effect which Weinberg & Katz observed. When suppressing the artificial instability, cusp removal is very slow and requires much more angular momentum to be transferred to the halo than a realistic stellar bar possibly possesses.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{kinematics}} of planar closed double chain linkages using the natural coordinate method. Different constraints including the rigid <b>bar,</b> <b>pin</b> joint, generalized angulated element (GAE) joint, and the boundary conditions of linkages were firstly used {{to form the}} system constraint equations. Then the degree of freedom of the linkages was calculated from the dimension of null space of the Jacobian matrix, which is the derivative of the constraint equations with respect to time. Furthermore, the redundant constraints can also be given by this method. Many types of planar linkages, such as the Hoberman linkage, Types I and II GAEs, nonintersecting GAEs, and linkages with the loop parallelogram condition, were investigated in this paper. It is found that when three boundary conditions {{are added to the}} system, the global motion of the system is lost. The results show that these linkages have only one degree of freedom. Moreover, the last two GAE constraints of the numerical examples given in this paper are redundant...|$|E
