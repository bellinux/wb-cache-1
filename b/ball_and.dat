40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to develop replacement bearings for the Rocketdyne Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) high pressure oxidizer turbopumps (HPOTPs). The replacement bearings consisted of standard <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> races with a special Battelle Self-Lubricating Insert Configuration (BASIC) retainer. The BASIC retainer consists of a phosphor bronze housing with inserts consisting of a polytetrafluoretheylene (PTFE) and bronze compound. The PTFE contacts the <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> the land guiding surface on the outer race. A PTFE transfer film is formed on <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> races, which lubricates the critical interfaces. The BASIC retainer is a one-to-one replacement for the current Armalon retainer, but has superior lubricating properties and is stronger over the broad temperature range anticipated for the HPOTP bearings. As {{a part of the}} project 40 sets of <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> races (two sizes) and 52 BASIC retainers were shipped to NASA/MSFC...|$|R
