5|$|After {{numerous}} {{requests for}} design alterations from the <b>Brazilian</b> Navy were accommodated or rejected, a contract was signed for a ship with fourteen 12-inch guns on 3 June 1911 for £2,675,000, and Rio de Janeiros keel was laid {{for the fourth}} time on 14 September. It did not take long for the <b>Brazilian</b> government to reconsider their decision again; by mid-1912, battleships with 14-inch guns were under construction, and suddenly it seemed that Rio de Janeiro would be outclassed upon completion. Making matters worse, a European depression {{after the end of the}} Second Balkan War in August 1913 reduced Brazil's ability to obtain foreign loans. This coincided with a collapse in Brazil's coffee and rubber exports, the latter due to the loss of the <b>Brazilian</b> rubber monopoly to British plantations in the Far East. The price of coffee declined by 20 percent and <b>Brazilian</b> exports of it dropped 12.5 percent between 1912 and 1913; rubber saw a similar decline of 25 and 36.6 percent, respectively. The <b>Brazilian</b> Navy later claimed that selling Rio de Janeiro was a tactical decision, so they could have two divisions of battleships: two with 12-inch guns (the Minas Geraes class), and two with 15-inch guns.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} <b>Brazilian</b> dreadnought, Minas Geraes, was launched, the <b>Brazilian</b> {{government}} began an extended campaign {{to remove the}} third dreadnought from the contract because of political—backlash from the Revolt of the Lash coupled with warming relations with Argentina—and economic reasons. After much negotiating and attempts from Armstrong to hold the <b>Brazilian</b> government to the contract, the Brazilians relented, {{due in part to}} lower bond rates that made it possible for the government to borrow the necessary money. Rio de Janeiro was laid down {{for the first time in}} March 1910.|$|E

5|$|Argentina {{was highly}} {{alarmed by the}} <b>Brazilian</b> move, and they quickly moved to nullify the {{remaining}} months of the naval-limiting restrictions in the 1902 pact with Chile. In November 1906, Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs, , remarked that {{any one of the}} new <b>Brazilian</b> vessels could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets. Despite the seeming hyperbole, his statement—made before the <b>Brazilian</b> government reordered the ships as dreadnoughts—ended up being close to the truth: in 1910, at least, the new <b>Brazilian</b> warships were seemingly stronger than any other vessel in the world, let alone any one ship in the Argentine or Chilean fleets. With this in mind, the Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers opined that maintaining the older Libertad class or Capitán Prat (respectively) was now a waste of money.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Differences in {{sex hormone}} levels among populations might {{contribute}} to the variation in breast cancer incidence across countries. Previous studies have shown higher breast cancer incidence and mortality among Japanese <b>Brazilians</b> than among Japanese. To clarify the difference in hormone levels among populations, we compared postmenopausal endogenous sex hormone levels among Japanese living in Japan, Japanese <b>Brazilians</b> living {{in the state of}} São Paulo, and non-Japanese <b>Brazilians</b> living in the state of São Paulo. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using a control group of case-control studies in Nagano, Japan, and São Paulo, Brazil. Participants were postmenopausal women older than 55 years of age who provided blood samples. We measured estradiol, estrone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), testosterone and free testosterone by radioimmunoassay; bioavailable estradiol by the ammonium sulfate precipitation method; and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) by immunoradiometric assay. A total of 363 women were included for the present analyses, comprising 185 Japanese, 44 Japanese <b>Brazilians</b> and 134 non-Japanese <b>Brazilians.</b> Results Japanese <b>Brazilians</b> had significantly higher levels of estradiol, bioavailable estradiol, estrone, testosterone and free testosterone levels, and lower SHBG levels, than Japanese. Japanese <b>Brazilians</b> also had significantly higher levels of bioavailable estradiol, estrone and DHEAS and lower levels of SHBG and androstenedione than non-Japanese <b>Brazilians.</b> Levels of estradiol, testosterone and free testosterone, however, did not differ between Japanese <b>Brazilians</b> and non-Japanese <b>Brazilians.</b> These differences were observed even after adjustment for known breast cancer risk factors. We also found an increase in estrogen and androgen levels with increasing body mass index, but no association for most of the other known risk factors. Conclusions We found higher levels of estrogens and androgens in Japanese <b>Brazilians</b> than in Japanese and levels similar to or higher than in non-Japanese <b>Brazilians.</b> Our findings may help explain the increase in the incidence and mortality rate of breast cancer among Japanese <b>Brazilians.</b> </p...|$|R

5|$|In 1904, the <b>Brazilian</b> Navy {{found itself}} well behind its Argentine and Chilean rivals in quality and total tonnage; few ships {{had been ordered}} {{since the fall of}} the <b>Brazilian</b> monarchy in 1889, while Argentina and Chile had just {{concluded}} a fifteen-year naval arms race which filled their navies with modern warships. Rising demand for coffee and rubber was fueling a large increase in the <b>Brazilian</b> government's revenue, and the country's legislature voted to devote some of the proceeds to address this naval imbalance.
