The victory of a Democrat in the Senate election was not assured, <b>because</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decades</b> the Republicans had won about half the elections for governor and senator.|$|E
40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{important}} factors influencing the competitiveness of a destination are destination governance and destination branding (Dwyer & Kim, 2003). Destination governance is instrumental in managing the fragmented and complex nature of tourist destinations effectively, while destination branding is important because it enhances a destination’s positioning and exerts considerable influence over tourists’ choices and their satisfaction. The relationship between destination governance and destination branding, however, has not been investigated in depth. This omission occurred <b>because</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decades</b> the literature on destination branding has mainly adopted a demand-side rather than a supply-side perspective (Konecnik & Go, 2008), whereas both should be taken into consideration for destination brand planning and positioning to be effective (Cai, 2002). Indeed, keeping in mind both these perspectives helps managers develop a coherent method of execution and to achieve consistency and cohesiveness in brand positioning (Freire, 2007). This chapter addresses the above point. It defines the concepts of a destination brand and destination branding, proposes a dynamic model of brand development that combines supply-side and demand-side perspectives, and analyses the main conditions for successful destination branding. The chapter concludes by arguing that, when considering how destination governance affects destination branding, three layers of governance should be examined: the internal governance of a Destination Management Organization (DMO), the governance of the relationship between stakeholders and the governance {{of the relationship between the}} DMO and stakeholders. This model therefore draws destination managers’ attention to the necessity of carrying out both internal and external marketing and branding operations when trying to achieve a unique destination brand positioning...|$|E
40|$|The high {{drop-out}} rate {{in upper}} secondary education is a major challenge to European and US educational programmes. Upper secondary education in Norway faces a similar challenge, <b>because</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decades,</b> around one-third of the students {{drop out of the}} educational programmes. The majority of the drop-outs are students in vocational programmes, and a substantial number are apprentices at the workplace. With these high drop-out rates and the ensuing personal, social and economic consequences, it is vital to address how {{upper secondary education}} systems can keep students connected throughout the programmes. By thoroughly analyzing learning environments and the experiences, interactions and processes which youth deal with during vocational education, insights into how characteristics of the learning environments relate to dropping-out and connectedness may be brought into educational discussions. The case study presented in this article explores how workplaces constitute learning environments and how apprentices participate in the learning environments of work according to their dispositions, aims and life plans. The findings show that the apprentices had different agencies and that they were involved in two distinct participation patterns at the workplace: a collaborative pattern and an executive pattern. Our findings also suggest that strong agency for the vocation may keep apprentices connected throughout the educational programme, although they are afforded an executive participation pattern. Based on our findings, it is appropriate to raise questions as to whether an unclear agency for the vocation, together with affordance of executive participation patterns, may suggest one possible answer for the high drop-out rate among apprentices...|$|E
