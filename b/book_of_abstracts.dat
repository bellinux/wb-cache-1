40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{evaluate}} the publication rate <b>of</b> scientific <b>abstracts</b> orally {{presented at the}} annual meeting of the French Society of Radiology (FSR), and to identify factors associated with publication. Material and methodsAbstracts were selected from the <b>books</b> <b>of</b> <b>abstracts</b> <b>of</b> the 2008 – 2010 annual meetings of the FSR. For each <b>abstract,</b> country <b>of</b> origin, diagnostic/interventional radiology, imaging techniques (plain radiography, angiography, ultrasound [US], computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), human/experimental study, retrospective/prospective design, number of subjects, oncologic study or not were noted. Publications were searched in Medline-indexed journals and factors associated analyzed by multivariate analysis. ResultsSeven hundred and forty-four abstracts lead to 298  publications (publication rate 40 %). Most abstracts reported retrospective studies (61 %), in humans (94 %), diagnostic imaging (85 %), from European authors (90 %), and oncology (27 %). Median number of subject was 39 (19 – 87). Main imaging techniques were MRI, CT, US (46 %, 29 %, 21 %). Publications were mostly in English (89 %), in radiological journals (72 %), with a mean 3. 5 ± 3. 7 impact factor. Publication was associated with a prospective design (OR= 1. 80), a submission from Europe (OR= 1. 71), angiography (OR= 2. 44), and oncology (OR= 1. 81). ConclusionThe annual meeting of the FSR is in French, but the rate of publication <b>of</b> presented <b>abstracts</b> is high, mostly in English in reputable journals...|$|R
