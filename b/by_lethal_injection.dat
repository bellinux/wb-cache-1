5|$|The jury deliberated for 23hours. On June 2, 1997, McVeigh {{was found}} guilty on 11counts of murder and conspiracy. Although the defense argued for a reduced {{sentence}} of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced to death. In May 2001, the Justice Department announced that the FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3,000documents to McVeigh's defense counsel. The Justice Department also announced that the execution would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents. On June 6, federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered the execution to proceed. After President George W. Bush approved the execution (McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the President must approve the execution of federal prisoners), he was executed <b>by</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>injection</b> at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, on June 11. The execution was transmitted on closed-circuit television so that the relatives of the victims could witness his death. McVeigh's execution was the first federal execution in 38years.|$|E
5|$|Cisneros and Martínez {{were arrested}} and charged with capital murder, which in Texas is {{punishable}} with a life sentence or death <b>by</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>injection.</b> Cisneros was taken to the Cameron County jail. On her way there, reporters asked if she was responsible for Fischer's murder, and she shook her head. Cisneros' husband also refused to comment. The police denied her bail, but her attorney said that she was a respected member of the Brownsville community and deserved bail. Cisneros's attorney told the press that the arrest was a mistake, and that he was confident the police had no solid evidence against her. Police responded by saying they were content with her arrest, but still needed to go after other people involved in the murder plot. Martínez' family also said they were shocked by the arrest, saying they hoped it was a mistake, and {{that they did not know}} the Fischers or Cisneros. On April 13, Cisneros was released from prison on a $300,000 bond, refusing to comment as she left. According to court documents, Cisneros did not go before a judge to obtain a bond. Her attorney reached an agreement with the Cameron County Court District after her bond was denied the week before. Martínez remained in prison, and her bond was set at the same amount the next day. Her lawyer stated that she deserved a bond as well because she was a senior citizen and had a clean criminal record.|$|E

50|$|Electric shock {{delivered}} by an electric chair is sometimes {{used as an}} official means of capital punishment in the United States, although its use has become rare in recent times. Although some original proponents of the electric chair considered {{it to be a}} more humane execution method than hanging, shooting, poison gassing, etc., it has now generally been replaced <b>by</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>injections</b> in states that practice capital punishment. Modern reporting has claimed that it sometimes takes several shocks to be lethal, and that the condemned person may actually catch fire before the process is complete.|$|R
