It has since been used to host youth international fixtures for both England and Wales while also hosting Non-League football for community teams in Oswestry.|$|E
5|$|The {{attitude}} was controlled with three hydrazine thrusters. The satellite transmitted data <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> with S-Band and Very High Frequency (VHF) transmitters, {{at a rate}} of 15 Mbit/s and 6 bit quantization. The satellite had three-axis fine attitude control with four wheels, which gave it +/- 0.7 degrees of control. The attitude control system also used horizon scanners, sun sensors, and a command antenna. A freon gas propulsion system allowed the satellite to make fine attitude adjustments. Landsat 2 could store 30 minutes worth of data on two wide-band video tape recorders.|$|E

5|$|Firs Park {{was located}} {{to the south}} of the canal in the centre of Falkirk, named after the street in which it was situated, Firs Street. The club moved to the ground in 1921 and in the same year, the club's record {{attendance}} was set at a Scottish Cup match against Partick Thistle when 12,000 spectators attended. Firs Park was East Stirlingshire's home for 87 years, except a solitary season in 1964 when the club played at Kilbowie Park in Clydebank after being controversially merged with Clydebank Juniors. As a result of the merger, Firs Park was closed, however, after only one season, the merger was disbanded and East Stirlingshire moved <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> where it remained {{until the end of the}} 2007–08 season. The decision was taken by the club to close Firs Park due to the prohibitive costs of potential refurbishing to meet new Scottish Football Association stadium criteria. At the time of closure, the ground had a capacity of 1,800 with 200 seated in the main stand.|$|E
5|$|On lap 43 of the race, Bianchi {{lost control}} {{of his car and}} veered right towards the run-off area {{on the outside of the}} Dunlop Curve (turn seven) of the Suzuka Circuit. He {{collided}} with the rear of a tractor crane tending to the removal of Adrian Sutil's Sauber after Sutil had spun out of control and crashed in the same area a lap before. Spectators' video footage and photographs of the accident revealed that the left side of Bianchi's Marussia car was extensively damaged and the roll bar destroyed as it slid under the tractor crane. The impact was such that the tractor crane was partially jolted off the ground causing Sutil's Sauber, which was suspended in the air by the crane, to fall <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The race was stopped and Lewis Hamilton was declared the winner.|$|E

25|$|Technological inventions {{are also}} rife in the Alexander romances. In John Gower's Confessio Amantis, for example, Alexander the Great {{constructs}} a flying machine by tying two griffins to a platform and dangling meat above {{them on a}} pole. This adventure is ended only the direct intervention of God, who destroys the device and throws Alexander <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> This does not, however, stop the legendary Alexander, who proceeds to have constructed a gigantic orb of glass which he uses to travel beneath the water. There he sees extraordinary marvels which eventually exceed his comprehension.|$|E
25|$|Frederick Alfred Pile, {{commander}} of Anti-Aircraft Command, studied {{the problem and}} proposed that enough anti-aircraft guns were available to produce a barrage of fire in the rocket's path, but only if provided with a reasonable prediction of the trajectory. The first estimates suggested that 320,000 shells {{would have to be}} fired for each rocket. About 2% of these were expected to fall <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> almost 90 tons of rounds, which would cause far more damage than the missile. At a 25 August 1944 meeting of the Crossbow Committee, the concept was rejected.|$|E
25|$|In December 2003 the {{aviation}} {{assets of the}} Russian Ground Forces —mostly helicopters— were transferred to the VVS, following the shooting down of a Mi-26 helicopter in Chechnya on 19 August 2002, that claimed 19 lives. The former Army Aviation was in its previous form intended for the direct support of the Ground Forces, by providing their tactical air support, conducting tactical aerial reconnaissance, transporting airborne troops, providing fire support of their actions, electronic warfare, setting of minefield barriers and other tasks. The former Army Aviation was subsequently managed by the Chief of the Department of Army Aviation. However, by 2010, {{it was announced that}} the 2003 decision to transfer Ground Force Aviation to the Air Force was reversed, with the transfer <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ground</b> Forces to occur sometime in 2015 or 2016.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of February 25, 1855, Baker entered the Stanwix Hall saloon with Jim Turner and Paudeen McLaughlin to confront Poole having {{threatened}} Morrissey with a gun during an argument only hours before. Walking up to Poole, Baker spat {{in his face and}} then pulled a Colt revolver but accidentally shot himself in the arm as he stepped back to draw the weapon. Dropping to the floor, he did manage to fire a second shot hitting Poole in the leg and similarly incapacitating him. Both men eventually got up from the floor, however Baker managed to get to Poole first and pistol whipped him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Baker then shot Poole twice, once in the stomach and the second in his chest, and left the saloon.|$|E
25|$|When {{dragged through}} a field the coulter cuts {{down into the}} soil and the share cuts {{horizontally}} from the previous furrow to the vertical cut. This releases a rectangular strip of sod that is then lifted by the share and carried by the mouldboard up and over, so that the strip of sod (slice of the topsoil) that is being cut lifts and rolls over as the plough moves forward, dropping <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> upside down into the furrow and onto the turned soil from the previous run down the field. Each gap in the ground where the soil has been lifted and moved across (usually to the right) is called a furrow. The sod that has been lifted from it rests at about a 45 degree angle in the next-door furrow and lies {{up the back of}} the sod from the previous run.|$|E
25|$|Riders {{take a seat}} {{in one of the}} 15 {{carriages}} which hold 2 riders each (for a {{total of}} 30 riders). There is no seat belt or restraint system on the ride, only a cage to hold on to during the ride as when the ride is in operation, gravity will keep the rider in place. Once the ride operators give the all clear, the ride begins to spin in a circle constantly picking up speed. It can take about 20 to 25 seconds for the ride to reach its top speed and lift off of the ground. After the ride lifts off the ground, the ride keeps rising eventually coming to an almost-vertical position. A few seconds later, the ride begins to descend <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The rides braking system is activated and the ride comes to a complete stop by the time it reaches the ground. One ride cycle is about 1 minute and 53 seconds.|$|E

25|$|There {{were two}} methods of {{piloting}} balloons: free flight or captive. Free flight {{meant that the}} balloon was able to travel in any direction or distance for as long or {{as far as the}} pilot was able to fly it. Captive flight meant that the balloon was retained by a tether or series of tethers manned by ground crews. Free flight required that the pilot ascend and return by his own control. Captive flight used ground crews to assist in altitude control and speedy return to the exact starting point. Tethers also allowed for the stringing of telegraph wires <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Information gathered from balloon observation was relayed to the ground by various means of signaling. From high altitudes the telegraph was almost always necessary. At closer altitudes a series of prepared flag signals, hand signals, or even a megaphone could be used to communicate with the ground. At night either the telegraph or lamps could be used. In the later battles of Lowe's tenure, all reports and communications were ordered to be made orally by ascending and descending with the balloon. This is notable in Lowe's Official Report II to the Secretary where his usual transcriptions of messages were lacking. Free flight would almost always require the aeronaut to return and make a report. This would be an obvious detriment to timely reporting.|$|E
