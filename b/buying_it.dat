5|$|On September 25, manager Bruce Bochy {{decided to}} give Zito one final start with the Giants {{as a tribute to}} his tenure with the team. Zito responded by {{allowing}} two runs (one earned) over five innings and earning the win in a 7–4 victory over the Dodgers.

Zito entered with two outs in the eighth inning on September 29 and struck out Mark Kotsay (playing his final game) as the Giants beat the Padres 7–6. He finished the 2013 season at 5–11 with a 5.74 ERA in 30 games, 25 of which were starts.

5|$|During the 1982–83 Football League season, both Oxford United and Reading {{competed in}} the Football League Third Division, then the third tier of English football—equivalent to today's League One. Managed by Jim Smith, Oxford {{challenged}} for promotion throughout the season, while Maurice Evans' Reading team languished near the relegation zone {{for much of the}} year, despite possessing one of the division's top-scoring forwards in Kerry Dixon. The colourful media mogul and former MP Robert Maxwell owned and chaired Oxford, having prevented the club's bankruptcy by <b>buying</b> <b>it</b> in 1982. One of the world's oldest football teams (established in 1871), Reading were a public limited company, chaired by Frank Waller, a prominent local businessman; while owning Oxford, Maxwell also held 19% of Reading's shares. The two clubs share a local rivalry. At the time, both were in financial difficulties, particularly Reading. Maxwell sought to build a new stadium for Oxford United; he had negotiated with the council over potential locations since the time of his takeover, favouring a site in the northern suburb of Marston, but had yet to win council permission to buy the land.|$|E
