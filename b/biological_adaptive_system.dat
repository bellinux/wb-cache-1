Fecha de lectura : 27 - 10 - 2005 RNA virus {{populations are}} wmplex distributions of closely related but nonidentical vanant genomes temed quasispecies. The quasispecies distribution depends on continuously arising mutants and processes {{of competition and}} selection acting upon them. The large heterogeneity in quasispecies {{is due to the}} low fidelity of viral RNA polymerases and the lack of error-repair activities during replication. Mutant distributions wnfer great adaptability to vira 1 populations. Therefore, the viral quasispecies is a <b>biological</b> <b>adaptive</b> <b>system.</b> Some adaptive systems, such the immune system, are endowed with a "memory" of past events. The main objective of this Ph. D. Thesis is to understand the mechanisms underlying replication of RNA viruses and the evolutionary implications of quasispecies dynamics. We have characterised the presence of "memory" in footand- mouth disease virus (FMDV) lineage c 9 22 harbouring,an interna 1 oligo-A insertion precediig the sewnd functional AUG codon. When c 922 was subjected to large population passages, revertant genomes devoid of the oligo-A rapidly outcompeted the genomes wntaining the oligo-A passage 20). Nevertheless, this insertion was retained in memory genomes, as analysed at passages 50 and 150 (c 922 p 50 and C 9 22 p 150). Memory genomes increased their fitness values during passage, despite being displaced by revertants, in agreement with the Red Queen's Hypothesis. We have analysed the c 9 zp 50 population by biological and molecular cloning of three different genornic regions. The results provide a detailed information of mutation mes. their frequencies, and presence of hotspots, and show that the analysis of biological and molecular clones both provide an indistinguishable characterisation of the mutant spectrum. We have expressed and pwified the FMDV polymerase (3 D) and studied the requirements for its in vitro activities. This enzyme is critica 1 for the understanding of the error-prone replication of FMDV. The purified 3 D has permitted Dr. Nuria Verdaguer and her group to solve by X-ray diffraction the structures of 3 D alone and in wmplex with a template-primer (at 1. 9 A and 3. 0 A resolution, respectively) and identify the residues involved in interaction with RNA. We have identified 3 D mutations in virus subjected to lethal mutagenesis, in particular Gly 118 as essential for FMDV RNA replication...|$|E
40|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems</b> {{share some}} common features: {{variation}} among their constituent elements and continuity of core information. Some of them, {{such as the}} immune system, are endowed with memory of past events. In this study we provide direct evidence that evolving viral quasispecies possess a molecular memory {{in the form of}} minority components that populate their mutant spectra. The experiments have involved foot-and-mouth disease virus populations with known evolutionary histories. The composition and behavior of the viral population in response to a selective constraint were influenced by past evolutionary history in a way that could not be predicted from examination of consensus nucleotide sequences of the viral populations. The molecular memory of the viral quasispecies influenced both the nature and the intensity of the response of the virus to a selective constraint...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} design and {{application}} of artificial immune systems (AISs), problem-solving systems inspired by the human and other immune systems. AISs to date have largely been modelled on the <b>biological</b> <b>adaptive</b> immune <b>system</b> and have taken little inspiration from the innate immune system. The {{first part of this}} thesis examines the biological innate immune system, which controls the <b>adaptive</b> immune <b>system.</b> The importance of the innate immune system suggests that AISs should also incorporate models of the innate immune system as well as the <b>adaptive</b> immune <b>system.</b> This thesis presents and discusses a number of design principles for AISs which are modelled on both innate and adaptive immunity. These novel design principles provided a structured framework for developing AISs which incorporate innate and <b>adaptive</b> immune <b>systems</b> in general. These design principles are used to build a software system which allows such AISs to be implemented and explored...|$|R

The Southwest American Indian Collaborative Network (SAICN) was established to build the capacity of tribal communities in the southwestern United States to address gaps in cancer education, access to services and policy and to promote community-based participatory research. A comprehensive evaluation of the five-year project identified numerous successes and struggles faced by the project. The evaluation was challenged, however, to fully describe and measure the cultural and community dynamics of capacity building in the participating Tribal communities. A complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems</b> framework was employed to more fully understand and describe project outcomes.

It is argued that mental processes proceed at a rate close to the optimal based on thermodynamic considerations.

The central role of information in physics has become clear by the theories of black hole thermodynamics that combine general relativity and quantum mechanics (e. g. [3, 12, 28, 31]).

50|$|The {{general theory}} of <b>adaptive</b> <b>biological</b> <b>systems,</b> named practopoiesis (meaning {{creation}} of actions), {{has been used to}} derive a theory that explains mental operations as an adaptive process. Much like species adapt through evolution and an organism adapts through development, the theory of anapoiesis (meaning re-creation) proposes that a thought is a process of adaptation to the immediate environment. This is performed by fast physiological machinery that can operate within a few 100s of milliseconds and relies on the mechanisms of neural adaptation. A key difference between anapoietic approach and the functional approach is that for anapoietic process much of the information needed for the mental operations is located outside the organism. If mental operations are an adaptive process, they do not juggle symbols internally (like a computer) but make guesses of what changes should be made to the nervous system and then test them against the environment.|$|R
30|$|The use of {{reliable}} biodiversity indicators that describe {{the state of}} ecosystems in a factual and responsive manner to set conservation efforts {{is one of the}} major goals of the Convention of Biological Diversity (Dobson 2005; Dobson et al. 2011). Thus, biodiversity indicators have gone from simple metrics that measure the diversity of organisms toward more comprehensive monitoring measures that indicate the state of ecosystems (Callicott and Mumford 1997; Cowell 1998; Reza and Abdullah 2011; Capmourteres and Anand 2016; Rempel et al. 2016; Roche and Campagne 2017). Within ecological monitoring frameworks, ecological integrity (EI) is a key concept for evaluating ecosystem condition (Thompson 1999; Tierney et al. 2009; Brown and Williams 2016). Previously defined, ecological integrity is “the capacity of the ecosystem to support and maintain a balanced, integrated, <b>adaptive</b> <b>biological</b> <b>system</b> having the full range of elements and processes expected in the natural habitat of a region” (Karr 1990; Angermeier and Karr 1994; Parrish et al. 2003), and therefore, it is directly associated with the current knowledge of ecosystem functioning (Jax 2010).|$|R
30|$|Human {{obesity is}} an example of an <b>adaptive</b> <b>biological</b> <b>system</b> that is storing fat in the body. Most fat is stored in adipose tissue, and fat is an {{efficient}} way to store energy. Excess energy, consumed at one time, is stored as fat in adipose tissue to be mobilized and used at a later time when food supply is inadequate. In the past, the ability to store an increased amount of adipose tissue was largely constrained by the external environment. Life was hard and food was often scarce; hence, humans evolved to respond and adapt to those conditions (Neel 1962). However, the modern environment has relaxed many of those constraints—to some extent, food is plentiful, and obtaining it does not require extreme or prolonged exertion. This development, in addition to technological, economic, and cultural factors, has created the circumstances that allow for the increased numbers of overweight and obese people in the world. Thus, the current epidemic of obesity results from the interaction of our environment with past behaviors that are inappropriate in the modern world (Power and Schulkin 2009). Understanding why these factors lead to obesity requires analyzing the underlying biology.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — There {{is much to}} {{gain from}} {{providing}} walking machines with passive dynamics, e. g. by including compliant elements in the structure. These elements can offer interesting properties such as self-stabilization, energy efficiency and simplified control. However, {{there is still no}} general design strategy for such robots and their controllers. In particular, the calibration of control parameters is often complicated because of the highly nonlinear behavior of the interactions between passive components and the environment. In this article, we propose an approach in which the calibration of a key parameter of a walking controller, namely its intrinsic frequency, is done automatically. The approach uses adaptive frequency oscillators to automatically tune the intrinsic frequency of the oscillators to the resonant frequency of a compliant quadruped robot. The tuning goes beyond simple synchronization and the learned frequency stays in the controller when the robot is put to halt. The controller is model free, robust and simple. Results are presented illustrating how the controller can robustly tune itself to the robot, as well as readapt when the mass of the robot is changed. We also provide an analysis of the convergence of the frequency adaptation for a linearized plant, and show how that analysis is useful for determining which type of sensory feedback must be used for stable convergence. This approach is expected to explain some aspects of developmental processes in <b>biological</b> and artificial <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems</b> that “develop ” through the embodied system-environment interactions.

The overlapping attributes of complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems</b> were distilled from the literature reviewed. Whereas the focus group workshop participants found the attributes valuable in understanding the dynamics of organisational behaviour, they found the {{new way of thinking}} challenging on a number of different perspectives. Some aspects of the Air Force organisation, like its high levels of organisational experience, will make the introduction to and use of complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems</b> thinking simpler, while other aspects of the Air Force organisation, like its sensitivity to complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems</b> terminology, will make the introduction and use of complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems</b> more challenging.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to identify human performance {{risks and benefits of}} <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems</b> through a systematic analysis and heuristic evaluation of <b>adaptive</b> <b>system</b> component types and characteristics. As flight deck automated systems have more access to aircraft data, sensor data, stored databases, communicated information, and real time flight crew inputs, as well as more ability to process that information in sophisticated ways to identify situational priorities and context, it is becoming more realistic for those automated systems to adapt their behavior based on context. Automated systems that can make such changes on their own are called <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems.</b> The concern here is with <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems</b> that are perceived by the pilot to behave non-deterministically even though they are technically deterministic. Based on a framework to describe the types and characteristics of <b>adaptive</b> <b>system</b> components, a risk/benefit analysis was preformed to identify potential issues. Based on this analysis, eight representative <b>adaptive</b> <b>system</b> storyboards were developed as the basis of a heuristic evaluation with pilots to validate the analysis and explore more detailed issues and potential risk mitigations.

Arguably, art comprises a complex system that is embedded in a broader social-cultural-environmental complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>system</b> (Fig.  1). Within the arts there are many forms and genres that might be nested and interacting complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems.</b> Using heavy metal as an example, this paper shows how a musical form can become its own complex <b>adaptive</b> <b>system</b> or socio-musicological systems.
