50|$|A great {{step forward}} in {{countering}} the problem of firedamp came when 'safety lamps' intended to provide illumination whilst being incapable of igniting firedamp were brought forward by both George Stephenson and Sir Humphry Davy, in response to accidents such as the Felling mine disaster near Newcastle upon Tyne claiming 92 lives on 25 May 1812. Davy experimented with brass gauze, determining the maximum size of the gaps and the optimum wire thickness to prevent a flame passing through the gauze. If a naked flame was thus enclosed totally by such a gauze, then methane could pass into the lamp and burn safely above the flame. Stephenson's lamp (the 'Geordie lamp') worked on a different principle: the flame was enclosed by glass; air access to the flame was through tubes sufficiently narrow that the flame could not <b>burn-back</b> in incoming firedamp, and the exiting gases were too weak in oxygen to allow the enclosed flame to reach the surrounding atmosphere. Both principles were combined in later versions of safety lamps.|$|E

The {{rotating}} drum camera we used provides until 160 frames to observe the arc extinction throughout the phenomenon which lasts 4 ms. From this frames, we show that three stages follow {{each other with a}} different value of the <b>burn-back</b> rate: the maximum values are obtained {{at the beginning of the}} phenomenon and are equal to 6. 65 m. s- 1 and 5. 81 m. s- 1 respectively for silver and copper fuse elements. The direct observation of the <b>burn-back</b> mechanism shows a reproducible disequilibrium depending on the nature of the electrode: the cathode erosion rate is 1. 7 times that for the anode rate in the case of silver, and 1. 2 times that for the anode in the case of copper...|$|E

When the motor is modeled as a cavity that is filled with a compressible fluid with normal mass and momentum and energy injection from the solid propellant surface, the problem posed is a standard one in steady computational aerodynamics. published or submitted for publicationis peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In most {{practical}} solid rocket motor design processes, final designs for grains are arrived at using computer-generated grids. This process is imminently practical for {{cases in which}} small numbers of final geometries are to be considered. However, for a grain design optimization process in which large numbers of grain configurations are to be considered, generating grids for each candidate design is often prohibitive. For such optimization processes analytical developments of burn perimeter and port area for two-dimensional grains are critically important. This paper offers a detailed development of the <b>burn-back</b> equations for a slotted grain with burning only on the slot faces...|$|E
40|$|Summary. We {{describe}} our parallel 3 -D {{surface and}} volume mesh modification strategy for large-scale simulation of physical systems with dynamically changing domain boundaries. Key components include an accurate, robust, and efficient surface propagation scheme, frequent mesh smoothing without topology changes, infrequent remeshing {{at regular intervals}} or when triggered by declining mesh quality, a novel hybrid geometric partitioner, accurate and conservative solution transfer to the new mesh, and {{a high degree of}} automation. We apply these techniques to simulations of internal gas flows in firing solid propellant rocket motors, as various geometrical features in the initially complex propellant configuration change dramatically due to <b>burn-back.</b> Smoothing and remeshing ensure that mesh quality remains high throughout these simulations without dominating the run time. ...|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{methods for}} solid rocket motor grain design are {{proving to be}} tremendously {{beneficial}} to some recent efforts to optimize solid-rocket propelled missiles. The analytical approach has fallen out of favor in recent decades; however, for some classes of grains, the analytical methods are much more efficient than grid-based techniques. This paper provides a review of analytical methods for calculating burn area and port area {{for a variety of}} cylindrically perforated solid rocket motor grains. The equations for the star, long spoke wagon wheel, and dendrite grains are summarized and the development of the <b>burn-back</b> equations for the short spoke wagon wheel and the truncated star configurations are included. This set of geometries and combinations of these geometries represent a very wide range of possibilities for two-dimensional grain design...|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} procedure {{has been}} established to predict the slag in a practical solid rocket motor with submerged nozzle. Both single-phase and two-phase flow analyses have been performed in the rocket motor port. Three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations along with SST turbulence model have been solved for gas-phase calculations. The effect of ejected alumina particles from the propellant geometry on the flow field has been simulated through Lagrangian tracking method. The computational methodology is firstly validated by comparing against other numerical results of rocket motors available in the literature before applying the same to predict the slag accumulation of a submerged rocket motor for strategic applications. <b>Burn-back</b> geometries at different instants have been simulated and parametric studies were performed {{to find out the}} effect of Al 2 O 3 particle size. It was observed that the slag capture rate increases uniformly with Al 2 O 3 particle size. The predicted slag accumulation data match closely with the ground test data for the range of conditions simulated in the present work...|$|E
40|$|Flow-visualization {{techniques}} {{were employed in}} a 1 / 8 -scale model of the Shuttle SRM to investigate the dominant SRM internal flow patterns. The mode included the two aft segments, the aft dome, and the convergent portion of the gimballed nozzle. The effects of 'blowing', resulting from gases produced by the burning propellant, were simulated through the introduction, of a uniform distribution of water along simulated <b>burn-back</b> patterns representing the surface at three different times in a firing. It {{was found that the}} effects of vortices shed from protruding inhibitor sections were greatly diminished by the effects of wall injection. It was also found that the extent of circumferential flow resulting from the removal of a portion of protruding inhibitor was limited in scope. Strong circumferential flow in the aft dome was observed when no grain surface was present in the dome. This flow included nozzle-entrance vortices, the occurrence of which probably resulted from interactions between the submerged-nozzle flow and the boundary-layer flow in the aft dome of the case...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the {{electric}} fuse operation the arcing period follows immediately the pre-arcing period depicted in Part 1 (Part 1. Pre-arcing period). The transition {{between these two}} operation steps is not fully understood at this time. To simplify {{the beginning of the}} arcing period can be identified with {{the electric}} arc ignition i. e. with the electrodes voltage drop. The consecutive plasma is of metallic type {{at the beginning of the}} arcing period and of metallic plus silica type with varying mixture up to the end of the arcing period. The energy brought by the fault current is withdrawn by means of the interaction between the electric arc and the arc quenching material (usually silica sand) whose morphometric properties influence the properties of the plasma column: composition, thermodynamic properties and transport coefficients of the plasma column depend on the porosity (and other morphometric properties) of the filler. The fuse element erosion also known as <b>burn-back</b> is responsible for the lengthening of the plasma column and the variations of the electric field. The whole of these processes is depicted by means of experimental results or modellings when possible...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDuring {{the working}} of {{electrical}} fuses, inside the fuse element the silver ribbon first begins to melt, to vaporize {{and then a}} fuse arc appears between the two separated parts of the element. Second, the electrodes are struck and the <b>burn-back</b> phenomenon takes place. Usually, the silver ribbon is enclosed inside a cavity filled with silica sand. During the vaporization of the fuse element, one can consider that the volume is fixed so that the pressure increase appears to reach pressures higher than atmospheric pressure. Thus, in this paper two pressures, 1 atm and 10 atm, are considered. The electrical field inside the plasma can reach high values since {{the distance between the}} cathode surface and the anode surface varies with time. That is to say from zero cm to one cm order. So we consider various electrical fields: 102 V/m, 103 V/m, 5 × 103 V/m, 104 V/m at atmospheric pressure and 105 V/m at a pressure of 10 atm. This study is made in heavy species temperature range from 2, 400 K to 10, 000 K. To study the plasma created inside the electric fuse, we first need to determine some characteristics in order to justify some hypotheses. That is to say: are the classical approximations of the thermal plasmas physics justified? In other words: plasma frequency, the ideality of the plasma, the Debye-HÜckel approximation and the drift velocity versus thermal velocity. These characteristics and assumptions are discussed and commented on in this paper. Then, an evaluation of non-thermal equilibrium versus considered electrical fields is given. Finally, considering the high mobility of electrons, we evaluate the electrical conductivities...|$|E
40|$|The Thesis {{presents}} an in-depth study of arcing behaviour of H. B. C. Fuses {{for a range}} of fuse elements and fillers, under critical current conditions. The methodologies used were the standard breaking capacity short-circuit test plus the application of crow-bar, Xray studies, metallographic microscopic and optical fiber arc detection techniques. Due to the observation of some unknown and puzzling arc phenomena it was decided to pursue the arc investigation by an extensive test programme of single uniform wire fuse elements. From the investigation a basic arc mechanism for the pre-peak and post-peak arcs period was discovered. The new mechanism was applied to single wire, strip, long notched, medium notched and short notched fuse elements and to paralleled wires and strips immersed in three quartz filler types: standard sand, high quality granular quartz and bound quartz in two different sizes. The proposed arc mechanism was modelled by a computer program which was used to simulate the described fuse constructions. The results of over 800 tests and subsequent simulation undoubtedly confirm that the proposed arc mechanism is applicable for the described fuse types. The experimental and analytical results are close enough to justify the model application for fuse designers and fuse users. A critical comparison of the experimental and analytical results with previous findings published by other researchers is presented. A detailed arc mechanism and the key behaviour rules are proposed, they are: " Maximum column voltage can not exceed the arc-root voltage. " The arc-root voltage and the initial dv/dt values are influenced by filler characteristics and are able to precisely characterize the filler behaviour. " The dv/dt, and consequently the <b>burn-back</b> are instantaneous current density functions. The application of the above rules allows the fuse designer to tailor the fuse element in order to obtain specific current and arc voltage waveforms. It is believed that the proposed arc mechanism and computer model is able to explain some puzzling are phenomena and eventually could be applied to predicting other low overload H. B. C. fuse behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Time-accurate {{unsteady}} flow simulations are being performed supporting the SRM T+ 68 sec pressure 'spike' anomaly investigation. The anomaly {{occurred in the}} RH SRM during the STS- 54 flight (STS- 54 B) {{but not in the}} LH SRM (STS- 54 A) causing a momentary thrust mismatch approaching the allowable limit at that time into the flight. Full-motor internal flow simulations using the USA- 2 D axisymmetric code are in progress for the nominal propellant <b>burn-back</b> geometry and flow conditions at T+ 68 -sec [...] Pc = 630 psi, gamma = 1. 1381, T(sub c) = 6200 R, perfect gas without aluminum particulate. In a cooperative effort with other investigation team members, CFD-derived pressure loading on the NBR and castable inhibitors was used iteratively to obtain nominal deformed geometry of each inhibitor, and the deformed (bent back) inhibitor geometry was entered into this model. Deformed geometry was computed using structural finite-element models. A solution for the {{unsteady flow}} has been obtained for the nominal flow conditions (existing prior to the occurrence of the anomaly) showing sustained standing pressure oscillations at nominally 14. 5 Hz in the motor IL acoustic mode that flight and static test data confirm to be normally present at this time. Average mass flow discharged from the nozzle was confirmed to be the nominal expected (9550 lbm/sec). The local inlet boundary condition is being perturbed at the location of the presumed reconstructed anomaly as identified by interior ballistics performance specialist team members. A time variation in local mass flow is used to simulate sudden increase in burning area due to localized propellant grain cracks. The solution will proceed to develop a pressure rise (proportional to total mass flow rate change squared). The volume-filling time constant (equivalent to 0. 5 Hz) comes into play in shaping the rise rate of the developing pressure 'spike' as it propagates at the speed of sound in both directions to the motor head end and nozzle. The objectives of the present analysis are to: (1) capture the dynamic responses of the motor combustion gas flow to correlate with available low-frequency (less than 12. 5 sample/sec) data and (2) observe the high-frequency (up to 50 Hz) characteristics of the response to determine any potentials for dynamic coupling...|$|E
