5|$|Either {{side of the}} Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which {{contains}} a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase {{to the east of}} the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of <b>book</b> <b>collecting</b> over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1980s, Putnam became {{increasingly}} disillusioned with what he perceived as the [...] "scientism" [...] and the rejection of history that characterize modern analytic philosophy. He rejected internal realism because it assumed a [...] "cognitive interface" [...] model of the relation between the mind and the world. Putnam claimed that the very notion of truth would have to be abandoned by a consistent eliminative materialist. Under the increasing influence of James and the pragmatists, he adopted a direct realist view of this relation. For a time, under the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein, he adopted a pluralist view of philosophy itself and came to view most philosophical problems as nothing more than conceptual or linguistic confusions created by philosophers by using ordinary language out of its original context. In 2017 a <b>book</b> <b>collecting</b> articles on pragmatism by both Ruth Anna and Hilary Putnam was published, Pragmatism as a Way of Life: The Lasting Legacy of William James and John Dewey (Harvard UP, 2017, [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|Innis {{discusses}} {{various aspects}} of Ptolemaic rule over Egypt including {{the founding of the}} ancient library and university at Alexandria made possible by access to abundant supplies of papyrus. [...] "By 285BC the library established by Ptolemy I had 20,000 manuscripts," [...] Innis writes, [...] "and {{by the middle of the}} first century 700,000, while a smaller library established by Ptolemy II...possibly for duplicates had 42,800." [...] He points out that the power of the written tradition in library and university gave rise to specialists, not poets and scholars — drudges who corrected proofs and those who indulged in the mania of <b>book</b> <b>collecting.</b> [...] "Literature was divorced from life, thought from action, poetry from philosophy." [...] Innis quotes the epic poet Apollonius's claim that [...] "a great book was a great evil." [...] Cheap papyrus also facilitated the rise of an extensive administrative system eventually rife with nepotism and other forms of bureaucratic corruption. [...] "An Egyptian theocratic state," [...] Innis notes, [...] "compelled its conquerors to establish similar institutions designed to reduce its power." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although in the 16th century, the Tripartitum (a law <b>book</b> <b>collecting</b> {{the body}} of common laws that had arisen from {{customary}} practise) declared again that all the nobles enjoyed the same liberties independently of their offices, birth or wealth, but in practise, even it acknowledged that some differences had been existing within the nobility. Nevertheless, the Tripartitum still distinguished between the [...] "true barons" [...] (veri barones) who held the highest offices and the [...] "barons only by name" [...] (barones solo nomine) who did not hold any high offices but used noble titles. [...] From 1526, the Habsburg kings rewarded their partisans with hereditary titles such as baron and count {{and the members of}} the families wearing such titles were invited to attend in person at the Diets. This costumary practise was confirmed by legislation in 1608, when the Diet passed an act prescribing that the monarchs were to send a personal invitation to the members of the upper nobility (i.e., to the [...] "true barons" [...] and to the nobles authorized by the kings to use hereditary titles) when convoking the Diet; thenceforward, the prelates {{and the members of the}} upper nobility formed the Diets' Upper House.|$|E
