5000|$|The bridge has two <b>roadway</b> <b>levels</b> {{carrying}} an aggregate of seven traffic lanes and a pedestrian walkway and spans Spuyten Duyvil Creek {{just east of}} where the tidal strait meets the Hudson River. [...] The bridge {{is part of the}} Henry Hudson Parkway designated as New York State Route 9A. To its west, at five feet above water level, is the Spuyten Duyvil Bridge, which is used by Amtrak trains heading to Albany, New York and other points north. The Spuyten Duyvil Metro-North station is located under the Henry Hudson Bridge on the Bronx side.|$|R

Field observations and experiments analysis show that an exhaust air <b>roadway,</b> <b>level</b> 100 of the Xiajing Coal Mine in Guangxi, China, {{is located in}} an intumescing rock with high in situ stress. Then we designed a bolt-mesh-anchor coupling support for the roadway repair and reinforcement, which consists of a first coupling support with bolt-mesh and secondary reinforcement with anchor cables. Field monitoring results show that bolt-mesh -cable coupling support has guaranteed the stabilization of the roadway and reduced the deformation of the surrounding rock considerably...|$|R
5000|$|These {{structures}} can {{be located}} either above the <b>roadway</b> or <b>below</b> the <b>roadway.</b> In the U.S., access under the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements means that stairs cannot {{be the only}} access to these structures. An elevator must be provided or a ramp built that conforms to the grade requirements under the ADA regulations.|$|R
50|$|Crathie Bridge (1854-1857) is a 125 foot {{single span}} across the River Dee {{to the royal}} Balmoral estate. The bridge had first been drawn with a form of the Brunel truss echoing his Royal Albert Bridge at Saltash. The bridge as {{constructed}} though used the C-shaped open form of the upper flange, as used for the Eastern Bengal Railway. As the bridge was only for light road traffic, it was also possible to replace the solid web of the girder above the <b>roadway</b> <b>level</b> with an openwork lattice, making {{the view from the}} bridge visually more appealing for its illustrious resident. Despite this, Her Majesty was 'not amused' by the bridge.|$|R
5000|$|The {{southern}} terminus of the cycleway is at [...] {{with access}} to Argyle Street and Upper Fort Street in The Rocks. At its southern terminus near the Sydney Observatory, the cycleway is located adjacent to the Western Distributor and connects with the Kent Street cycleway. The northern terminus of the cycleway is at Burton Street, , just below Milsons Point railway station. From this location riders ascend 55 stairs in order to access the path that {{is located on the}} <b>roadway</b> <b>level,</b> some 51 m above the water level.

50|$|The George Washington Carver Bridge {{is located}} in Des Moines, Iowa over the Raccoon River. Part of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Parkway, the bridge {{provides}} three roadway lanes {{in one direction and}} two roadway lanes and one bikeway/pedestrian lane in the opposite direction framed by two arches. The main supporting structures and free standing arches are visible at the <b>roadway</b> <b>level.</b> The <b>roadway</b> is suspended by cables from two steel arches, painted blue to complement the site's abundant greenery and to clearly mark the river crossing. The arches, with their concrete superstructures, appear to float over the water framing the views of the skyline and Iowa's tallest skyscraper, creating a welcoming gateway to the city from the airport.|$|R
5|$|To {{avoid the}} need to {{purchase}} agreements for running under surface buildings, the tunnels were bored <b>below</b> <b>roadways,</b> where construction could be carried out without charge. At {{the northern end of}} the railway, {{the need to}} pass deep beneath the bed of the River Thames and the medieval street pattern of the City of London constrained the arrangement of the tunnels on the approach to King William Street station. Because of the proximity of the station to the river, steeply inclined tunnels were required {{to the west of the}} station. Because of the narrow street under which they ran, they were bored one above the other rather than side by side as elsewhere. The outbound tunnel was the lower and steeper of the two. The tunnels converged immediately before the station, which was in one large tunnel and comprised a single track with a platform on each side. The other terminus at Stockwell was also constructed in a single tunnel but with tracks on each side of a central platform.|$|R
50|$|Mitigation {{does not}} entirely involve {{large-scale}} {{changes such as}} road construction, but everyday people can contribute. Walking, cycling trips, short or non-commute trips, can be an alternate mode of transportation when traveling short or even long distances. A multi-modal trip involving walking, a bus ride, and bicycling may be counted solely as a transit trip. Economic evaluations of transportation investments often ignore the true impacts of increased vehicular traffic—incremental parking, traffic accidents, and consumer costs—and the real benefits of alternative modes of transport. Most travel models do {{not account for the}} negative impacts of additional vehicular traffic that result from roadway capacity expansion and overestimate the economic benefits of urban highway projects. Transportation planning indicators, such as average traffic speeds, congestion delays, and <b>roadway</b> <b>level</b> of service, measure mobility rather than accessibility.|$|R
40|$|Being {{a public}} resource, the roadway space was {{distributed}} between different road users {{based on the}} Passenger-Car-Unit (PCU) concept. However, this concept tends to under estimate the capacity of public transportation and non-motorized travel. To improve the traditional car-oriented design to become more human-oriented, this study proposed a Passing-passenger-unit (PPU) and the method to observe the PPU in <b>roadway</b> <b>level</b> and area level. The PPU data were collected for urban arterials and residential areas in China to test the method and to compare the right-of-way distribution at different types of locations. Results showed that the PPU revealed the true efficiency of the facility carrying passengers. Using PPU would {{tell a different story}} about the facility or system compared to using PCU. Additionally, using PPU to analyze the right-of-way for the roadway or community could offer guidance for improving pedestrian and bicyclist environment...|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} {{historically}} significant {{as an example}} of a small-scale 19th century stone arch highway bridge. The stone used in the bridge is locally-quarried gray limestone. Ornamentation on the bridge includes protruding keystones at the top of the arch, a slight peak at the top of the arch, and a string course that matches the <b>roadway</b> <b>level.</b> The bridge resembles other stone arch bridges built in Minnesota townships during the late 19th century and early 20th century, but the ornamentation sets it apart. Another facet of historical importance is the fact that the bridge has never been substantially altered during its lifetime, except for a concrete cap replacing the original coping at the top of the railings. The bridge has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places (#89001825) due to its historical integrity.|$|R
5|$|During {{the later}} 1920s, Holden {{designed}} {{a series of}} replacement buildings and new façades for station improvements around the UERL's network. Many of these featured Portland stone cladding and variations of the glazed screens developed for the Morden extension. At Piccadilly Circus, {{one of the busiest}} stations on the system, Holden designed (1925–28) a spacious travertine-lined circulating concourse and ticket hall <b>below</b> the <b>roadway</b> of the junction from which banks of escalators gave access to the platforms below.|$|R
5000|$|On May 13, 2014, {{an article}} on SFGate Blog {{announced}} that the new troll has officially {{been placed on the}} eastern span of the Bay Bridge. It was said to have been installed overnight, as it is averse to sunlight. [...] "The new troll emerged from hiding Friday and quietly moved in, settling on Pier E2." [...] The troll was placed <b>below</b> the <b>roadway</b> out of sight of motorists however it can be seen from a pedestrian walkway.|$|R
5000|$|Construction {{commenced}} 1939 and {{the bridge}} was opened on 30 May 1943. It is of steel arched construction, having 10 piers in the sea from which the arches spring. The designer of the bridge is Anker Engelund (1889-1961). He was a civil engineer, professor and rector of the Copenhagen Polytechnic educational institution from 1941 to 1959. [...] "He created a classic arch bridge whose superstructure of a large steel arch {{in the center and}} ten iron arches, <b>below</b> the <b>roadway</b> lie is worn".|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} a steel {{cantilever}} bridge {{which is a}} type of continuous truss bridge. The bridge's main span is uncommon for a cantilever bridge in that the truss over the main channel tapers upward and the <b>roadway</b> <b>below</b> is suspended from the truss by steel hangers.|$|R
5000|$|The viaduct, {{situated}} {{at the bottom of}} the Lydbrook Valley where it meets the Wye Valley, consisted of five stone arches and three wrought iron lattice truss girders.

Colonel Henry Giltner’s cavalry brigade established contact with federal pickets before Bean’s Station by about 2:00p.m., and the battle began. The Federal position, rested {{on both sides of}} the Rutledge Road. [...] The Union commander, Brig. Gen. J. M. Shackelford, positioned his artillery behind a brook on either side of the road. Confederate forces advancing from the east also positioned their artillery batteries above and <b>below</b> the <b>roadway.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Sydney Harbour Bridge {{cycleway}} comprises two conjoined cycleways {{from the}} north and south that crosses the Sydney Harbour Bridge on its western side, linking the Sydney central business district with North Sydney, Sydney's Northern Suburbs and the North Shore.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates freeway-flow {{impacts of}} different traveler types by specifying and applying a mixture model of congested and uncongested driving behaviors. Results indicate that mixture models are promising tools for traffic data analysis and that information on travelers, their vehicles, and weather conditions explains significant variation in flow data. Introduction and Background: It is well accepted that distinct <b>roadways</b> accommodate different <b>levels</b> {{and patterns of}} vehicular flow, {{by virtue of their}} design. Transportation engineers in the United States rely on the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 1998) to estimate what constitutes capacity for a given <b>roadway</b> and what <b>levels</b> of service are experienced by travelers under different traffic conditions...|$|R
50|$|Fairly typical <b>roadway</b> noise <b>levels</b> are {{sufficient}} to constrict arterial blood flow {{and lead to}} elevated blood pressure; in this case, it appears that a certain fraction {{of the population is}} more susceptible to vasoconstriction. This may result because annoyance from the sound causes elevated adrenaline levels trigger a narrowing of the blood vessels (vasoconstriction), or independently through medical stress reactions. Other effects of high noise levels are increased frequency of headaches, fatigue, stomach ulcers, and vertigo.|$|R
2500|$|Double-decked (or double-decker) bridges {{have two}} levels, {{such as the}} George Washington Bridge, {{connecting}} New York City to Bergen County, New Jersey, USA, as the world's busiest bridge, carrying 102 million vehicles annually; truss work between the <b>roadway</b> <b>levels</b> provided stiffness to the roadways and reduced movement of the upper level when the lower level was installed three decades after the upper level. The Tsing Ma Bridge and Kap Shui Mun Bridge in Hong Kong have six lanes on their upper decks, and on their lower decks there are two lanes {{and a pair of}} tracks for MTR metro trains. [...] Some double-decked bridges only use one level for street traffic; the Washington Avenue Bridge in Minneapolis reserves its lower level for automobile and light rail traffic and its upper level for pedestrian and bicycle traffic (predominantly students at the University of Minnesota). Likewise, in Toronto, the Prince Edward Viaduct has five lanes of motor traffic, bicycle lanes, and sidewalks on its upper deck; and a pair of tracks for the Bloor–Danforth subway line on its lower deck. The western span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge also has two levels.|$|R
50|$|An obscure {{whitewater}} kayak run until 2000, Left Hand Canyon {{was first}} run in 1998 by Brook Aitken, Chris McEniry, and Craig D. Irwin.

50|$|The {{school is}} located on a 45 acre fenced campus on the {{outskirts}} of Sherbrooke within viewing distance of Bishops University and Lennoxville. The school was constructed with concrete blocks and red brick in a Celtic cross-shape, nestled in a depression with a surrounding <b>roadway</b> <b>level</b> with the 2nd floor. The central block is 3-floors high with the administrative offices and auditorium on the ground floor, the cafeteria, kitchens and music rooms on the second floor, and the library is alone on the top floor. The gym's east wall butts against the stage wall of the auditorium on a level even lower than the ground floor. The classrooms, shops and labs are in the three wings, each divided into two houses. The wings are connected to the central block by glass walkways on the 2nd and 3rd floors, with a courtyard on ground level. In the early years the wings were Yellow, Orange, Red, Purple, Blue and Green. Students were assigned a homeroom with students from all grades, and where they had a locker. Each of the stairwells have outside exits. The school has limited structural accommodations for wheelchair or limited mobility users. Part of the building (one wing) is used by the Eastern Townships Technical Institute - a vocational education center.|$|R
