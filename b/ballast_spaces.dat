50|$|Inside the caisson are <b>ballast</b> <b>spaces,</b> {{filled with}} water for stability. An upper space is sealed from the rest and this may contain either water, to sink the caisson firmly into its socket in the dock, or else pumped dry and {{allowing}} it to float free.|$|E

50|$|A {{cofferdam}} {{may also}} refer to an insulating space between two watertight bulkheads or decks within a ship. A cofferdam {{may be a}} void (empty) <b>space</b> or a <b>ballast</b> <b>space.</b> Cofferdams are usually employed to ensure oil or other chemicals do not leak into machinery spaces. If two different cargoes that react dangerously with each other are carried on the same vessel, one or more cofferdams are usually required between the cargo spaces.|$|R

50|$|Savannah {{served as}} a {{passenger}}-cargo liner until 1965, when passenger service was discontinued. By this time a total of 848 passengers had been carried along with 4,800 tons of cargo. The ship was converted to all-cargo use, with the removal of 1,800 tons of <b>ballast.</b> Passenger <b>spaces</b> were closed. Savannah operated {{for three years and}} traveled 350000 mi before returning to Galveston for refueling. Four of the 32 fuel assemblies were replaced and the remaining units rearranged to even out fuel usage. She resumed service until the end of 1971, when she was deactivated.|$|R
50|$|For strength, as the caisson has {{to resist}} a {{considerable}} pressure of deep water against its air-filled <b>ballast</b> <b>spaces,</b> many caissons still retain a curved or boat-shaped hull. In modern caissons {{this is usually}} simplified to a single-curvature arch, rather than a compound curved hull. Some shipyards made a particular trade of building caissons or lock gates. Edward Finch's bridge works was established in Chepstow in the mid 19th century to build ironwork for Brunel's Chepstow Railway Bridge directly above it. As the narrowness and high tides of the River Wye limited {{the size of the}} ships that could be built there, they came to specialise in caisson work and supplied most of the docks along the Bristol Channel and beyond.|$|E

In ship’s hull production, surface preparation is a demanding technological work operation which begins with primary surface preparation (preparation of plates and sections for dyeing workshop with protective coating) and continues with the preparation of steel before painting of sub-assembled sections and blocks according to ISO 8501 - 3 grade P 2. The surface preparation or additional surface preparation work, according to the above mentioned standards, require some additional technological time, a new human resources which in the end can significantly affect the ship's hull building time and the final price of the vessel in its entirety. Shipyard has to apply 1 control process over surface preparation during the process of drafting and construction of hull and provide in this way the impact on production costs, reduce them to a minimum at each stage of the production process, respecting the norms and criteria for processing, quality control and hull building schedule.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation on oil leakage from the {{double hull tanker}} (DHT). It is designed to explore the dynamic process of oil leakage from bottom-rupture hole of DHT. The experimental test shows the leakage resistance mechanism of <b>ballast</b> tank <b>space.</b> The behavior of oil leakage from damaged DHT and dynamic features of flow in the overall process are demonstrated from experimental results. The overall process of oil leakage is divided into free-leakage and resistance-leakage stage according to the corresponding power to study the dynamic features of oil-water flow inside or outside the tank. The corresponding dominated factors of oil leakage in different stage are also pointed out, and the unsteady Bernoulli's equation is used to verify experimental results. Meanwhile, viscous effect in leakage process is discussed {{and the importance of}} hydrodynamic features associated with the mechanism of oil leakage is explored from experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{provides an}} improvement in a keel arrangement for a sailboat hull, of the kind having an elongated <b>ballast</b> member <b>spaced</b> below the hull so as normally to extend horizontally and fore-and-aft under the hull, and a front foil and a rear foil depending respectively from a front and a rear portion of the hull, the lower ends of which between them support the ballast member, and in which the rear foil is pivotable about a vertical axis {{to allow it to}} act as a rudder. The improvement comprises a joint connecting a main, front portion of the ballast member to a minor, rear portion thereof, the joint allowing both longitudinal and rotational movement between the ballast member portions, whereby the foils can bend independently of each other, and the large majority of drag forces on the ballast member are resisted only by the front foil.

40|$|The current {{trend of}} {{extending}} digital heating, ventilat-ing, and air-conditioning (HVAC) and lighting controls to terminal devices {{has had an}} enormous impact on the role of global strategies for energy and comfort optimization. In some respects optimization algorithms are becoming simpler because more complete information about conditions throughout the building is now available to the control sys-tem. However, the task of analyzing this information often adds a new layer of complexity to the process of developing these algorithms. Also, the extension of direct digital control (DDC) to terminal devices offers new energy and comfort control optimization opportunities that require additional global optimization algorithms. This paper discusses the changing role of global optimi-zation strategies as the integration of DDC systems is extended to terminal equipment. The discussion offers sug-gestions about how the development of more powerful global optimization strategies needs to be considered {{in the design of the}} mechanical equipment. Specifically, four areas of glo-bal optimization are discussed:. optimization of variable-air-volume (VAV) airflow, l optimization of lighting level via dimming <b>ballasts,.</b> optimization of <b>space</b> temperature setpoint, and. optimization of chiller and boiler operation. In each of these categories, a control philosophy employing global optimization is discussed, sample control algorithms are provided, and a discussion of the implication of these new control opportunities on the design of the mechanical components is included...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{relevant}} problems in ship construction and maintenance nowadays concerns the corrosion in the double hull <b>space</b> <b>ballast</b> tanks of modern merchant vessels. On the one hand, {{there is a general}} consensus that the economic life span of such a vessel depends primarily upon the corrosion state of its ballast tanks, while on the other hand, the position of these tanks, squeezed between the outer hull and the loading tanks, makes routine inspection and maintenance almost impossible. Today, ship's ballast tanks are usually constructed in grade A steel and protected with a standard epoxy coating, backed up with sacrificial zinc anodes. Such a construction has been applied without significant alterations for many years. However, the objective of this economic study is to compare this construction method with some feasible alternatives. The considered alternatives are: (1) an increase of the scantlings, eliminating the necessity to replace corroded steel but diminishing the cargo carrying capacity of the ship, (2) application of the novel and more durable TSCF 25 coating (3), the use of corrosion resistant steel in ship construction or (4) a standard PSPC 15 coating combined with lifetime lasting aluminum sacrificial anodes. After running each alternative through a cost model including an extensive sensitivity analysis, it is concluded that the durable coating and the use of lifetime lasting aluminum anodes are bound to improve the actual basic tank concept. Corrosion resistant steel becomes attractive depending upon the evolution of the international steel market...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{problems}} among vessel construction and maintenance is the corrosion that takes place in the double hull <b>space</b> <b>ballast</b> tanks have in merchant vessels. Bio-degradation takes place in ballast tank coatings in marine environments. Ballast tanks can carry more than ballast water, most of the time ballast tanks are filled with other bacteria or organisms. Some of these bacteria can that can be picked up {{from other parts of the}} world can cause the ballast tank to get damaged. Bacteria from different regions plus the natural bacteria can cause ballast tanks to break down. The natural bacteria community has an interaction of the natural bio-films with the coating, an aspect which is not covered in standard procedures. Researchers have shown that biological activity indeed significantly affects the coating properties. Micro-cracks and small holes have been found in ballast tanks. Acidic bacteria created holes with 0.2-0.9 μm in length and 4-9 μm in width. The natural community caused cracks of 2-8 μm in depth and 1 μm in length. The EIS technique was used to examine the degradation. The bacterial affected coatings decreased in corrosion resistance. The natural community, has a clear loss in coating resistance over time. Also, coating corrosion resistance declines after 40 days of exposure to the natural community, resulting in blisters in the ballast tank. Bacteria might be linked to certain bio-film patterns affecting various types of coating attacks.|$|R
40|$|It is well {{understood}} that the spilled oil from damaged oil tankers poses a severe threat to the marine environment. Although great efforts have been devoted to studying the oil spilling from damaged oil tankers, especially double hull tanks (DHTs), the majority is subjected to an ideal condition (e. g., fixed tanks in still water; simple damage conditions) and adopts hydrostatic theories or quasi-steady models with over-simplified assumptions on data analysis or analytical prediction. These conditions or assumptions may not stand in the complex dynamic spilling process in the real spilling accident. This study brings a step further on the knowledge of oil spilling from a damaged tank by combining experimental and numerical investigations, {{with a focus on}} the dynamic spilling process from damaged oil tankers which is either fixed or subjected to motion, which have not been systematically investigated. In the experimental investigation, the submerged oil spilling from DHTs under different accidental scenarios including grounding and collision is studied. Two new sets of laboratory tests are carried out, where the damaged tank is fixed in still water. In the first set, the axial offset between the internal and the external holes on two hulls of the grounded DHT is considered to widen the scope of damage conditions which the tanker may suffer from during grounding accidents. Although all cases in this set are subjected to the same hydrostatic conditions, completely different dynamic spilling processes are observed. In the second set, the initial water thickness inside the ballast tank of the collided DHT is considered. This aims to represent the real scenarios that the external hull is generally damaged prior to the internal hull and, therefore the <b>ballast</b> <b>space</b> is partially filled by the water flowing from the surrounding environment before the internal hull is damaged. These experiments do not only advance {{the state of the art}} of the experimental study in this field, but also provide a reference for validating the numerical models developed in this study. Based on the experimental data, the correlation analysis for the discharge through the internal hole by using quasi-steady Bernoulli’s equation is presented, contributing to the development of an improved analytical model for predicting the oil spilling from damaged oil tankers. The numerical study is carried out using a numerical model developed in OpenFOAM framework, where the VOF is applied to deal with the air-oil-water multiphase flow. This model enables the users: (1) to consider air, oil and water three phases of fluid and their interaction with solid tanker hull using dynamic mesh technologies; (2) to model turbulence associated with the oil spilling process using various available turbulent models; and (3) to investigate the effects of the compressibility of the fluid. The oil spilling from damaged DHTs is simulated and validated by the experimental data. Intensive investigations are carried out to clarify uncertainties in existing numerical modelling of the oil spilling from damaged DHTs. These include (1) the associated turbulence behaviours and selecting an appropriate approach to turbulence modelling; (2) the role of fluid compressibility during the oil spilling; and (3) the effect of tank motion on the oil spilling process. For the turbulence modelling, various approaches to model the turbulence, including the large eddy simulation (LES), direct numerical simulation (DNS) and the Reynolds average Navier-Stokes equation (RANS) with different turbulence models are attempted. It is concluded that the oil spilling from DHTs is more sensitive to the turbulence modelling than that from SHTs. For DHT cases, the effective Reynolds number (Re) considering both oil outflow and water inflow is suggested to classify the significance of the turbulence and to correspondingly select the appropriate turbulence model. The investigation on the role of the air compressibility in the oil spilling from damaged DHTs reveals that the air compressibility may be considerable in a small temporal-spatial scale (e. g., jet-jet and jet-structure impact pressure), but plays an insignificant role in the macroscopic process of the oil spilling (e. g., spilling discharge and volume). In order to approach the spilling phenomena in the more realistic environment, a systematic numerical study is carried out to investigate the effect of the periodic ship motion on the oil spilling from the damaged tank. Different tank designs (i. e., SHTs and DHTs), accidental scenarios (i. e., grounding and collision) and tank motion parameters (i. e., types, frequencies and amplitude) are considered. The result indicates that the tank motion does not only cause a periodic oscillation of the oil/water flow through the broken hole, but also induces a second long-duration stage of spilling after a quasi-hydrostatic-equilibrium condition occurs, resulting in the more significant amount of spilled oil. By using both the experimental data and numerical results produced in this research, an improved prediction model for oil spilling from damaged DHTs in still is formulated. This model considers the case-dependent hydrodynamic interaction between the oil and water jet flows inside the ballast tank and its effect on the spilling process. The result using the improved model is compared with the numerical result indicating its superiority over the existing model...|$|R
