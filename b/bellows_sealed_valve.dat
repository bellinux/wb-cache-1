40|$|The {{simulation}} of the Auxiliary Charcoal Bed (ACB) Vacuum System {{was performed to}} evaluate the original vacuum system design, detect and identify design deficiencies, investigate the effects of proposed corrections on system performance, and generally aid in refining the system design before construction and mockup testing. The simulation was performed by using the Advanced Continuous Simulation Language (ACSL). The vacuum system design goals are to provide approximately 20 SCFM of both booster gas and purge gas through the system and maintain a flow of approximately 40 SCFM with a velocity of 50 to 75 f/sec {{at the entrance to}} the cyclone separator. The model results showed that the original system design was incapable of meeting the system performance goals. Further simulations showed that the following modifications to the original vacuum system design were required to make the system performance acceptable; (1) Remove valve PCV 4. (2) Modify the flow controllers FTC 3 and FTC 4 from the original flow range of 0 - 17. 6 SCFM (0 - 500 SLM) to 0 - 35. 3 SCFM (0 - 1000 SLM). (3) Replace the <b>bellows</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>valves</b> SV- 1, SV- 3 A, SV- 3 B, SV- 4 A, and SV- 4 B with less restrictive ball valves. The simulation results saved considerable time and effort by identifying flaws in the original system design.

40|$|Lecturepg. 23 Metal <b>bellows</b> <b>seals,</b> {{originally}} {{developed for the}} aerospace/defense industry, are now widely accepted in the petrochemical, chemical, and general industrial markets. Metal <b>bellows</b> <b>seals</b> offer enhanced dynamic tracking of the seal rings because they eliminate dynamic secondary seals. They are ideally suited for difficult high temperature applications, {{like those in the}} petrochemical industry that demand enhanced seal reliability. An effective means of ensuring seal reliability is by controlling face distortion, which directly affects the operating conditions at the sealing surface. When designing a seal, it is necessary to consider distortion resulting from pressure, the presence of temperature gradients {{in the area of the}} interface, and stress relaxation of interference fit components. All three of these factors can result in distortion of the face and changes to the lubricating fluid film thickness between the faces. Historically, to reduce stress relaxation of interference fit components in high temperature applications, material selection was limited to materials with a coefficient of thermal expansion similar to that of the seal ring insert. Recently, innovative design and manufacturing technology has made it possible to offer metal <b>bellows</b> <b>seals</b> made of corrosion resistant alloys for high temperature applications (up to 800 degrees F). This design controls face distortion at elevated temperatures. It does this through design rather than material selection, which limits the applicability of the seal. A comparison of the new design to more traditional designs is made and the performance advantages, including experimental and field test results, are described. The combination of an optimized metal bellows and balanced interference fit technologies provide enhanced seal performance for high temperature, corrosive applications...|$|R

50|$|Bottom {{blowdown}} piping drains {{the lowest}} {{parts of the}} boiler {{so it can be}} used to drain the boiler for servicing. Bottom blowdown piping must be of a diameter large enough to minimize the risk of being plugged with baked sludge. Modern boilers discharge bottom blowdown to a blowoff tank where the blowdown can flash and vent steam upwards without entraining water which might cause burns. A pipe near the bottom of the blowoff tank maintains a water level below the blowdown entry point and allows cooler water remaining from earlier blowdown events to drain from the tank first. Two bottom blowdown valves are often used in series to minimize erosion. One valve serves as the <b>sealing</b> <b>valve,</b> and the other as the blowdown <b>valve.</b> The <b>sealing</b> <b>valve</b> is customarily opened first and closed last. Both are opened rapidly and fully to minimize erosion on the seat and disk faces.

Bottom blowdown valves are often rebuilt or replaced whenever the boiler is taken out of service for maintenance.|$|R

40|$|For commercial, military, and {{aerospace}} applications, low-cost, small, reliable, and lightweight gas and liquid hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>valves</b> with post initiation on/off capability are highly desirable for pressurized systems. Applications include remote fire suppression, single-use system-pressurization systems, spacecraft propellant systems, and in situ instruments. Current pyrotechnic- activated rupture disk hermetic valves {{were designed for}} physically larger systems and are heavy and integrate poorly with portable equipment, aircraft, and small spacecraft and instrument systems. Additionally, current pyrotechnically activated systems impart high g-force shock loads to surrounding components and structures, which {{increase the risk of}} damage and can require additional mitigation. The disclosed mechanism addresses the need for producing a hermetically <b>sealed</b> micro-isolation <b>valve</b> for low and high pressure for commercial, aerospace, and spacecraft applications. High-precision electrical discharge machining (EDM) parts allow for the machining of mated parts with gaps less than a thousandth of an inch. These high-precision parts are used to support against pressure and extrusion, a thin hermetically welded diaphragm. This diaphragm ruptures from a pressure differential when the support is removed and/or when the plunger is forced against the diaphragm. With the addition of conventional seals to the plunger and a two-way actuator, a derivative of this design would allow nonhermetic use as an on/off or metering valve after the initial rupturing of the hermetic sealing disk. In addition, in a single-use hermetically <b>sealed</b> isolation <b>valve,</b> the valve can be activated without the use of potential leak-inducing valve body penetrations. One implementation of this technology is a high-pressure, high-flow-rate rupture valve that is self-rupturing, which is advantageous for high-pressure applications such as gas isolation valves. Once initiated, this technology is self-energizing and requires low force compared to current pyrotechnic-based burst disk hermetic valves. This is a novel design for producing a single-use, self-rupturing, hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>valve</b> for isolation of pressurized gas and/or liquids. This design can also be applied for single-use disposable valves for chemical instruments. A welded foil diaphragm is fully supported by two mated surfaces that are machined to micron accuracies using EDM. To open the valve, one of the surfaces is moved relative to the other to (a) remove the support creating an unsupported diaphragm that ruptures due to over pressure, and/or (b) produce tension in the diaphragm and rupture it...|$|R
