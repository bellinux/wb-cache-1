25|$|I {{remember}} somebody {{yelling and}} seeing a big {{ball of fire}} {{near the top of}} the tent. And this ball of fire just got <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>bigger.</b> By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down — I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm and pulled me out.|$|E

50|$|Many {{adjectives}} have comparative and superlative {{forms in}} -er and -est, such as faster and fastest (from the positive form fast). Spelling rules which maintain pronunciation apply to suffixing adjectives {{just as they}} do for similar treatment of regular past tense formation; these cover consonant doubling (as in <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>biggest,</b> from <b>big)</b> <b>and</b> the change of y to i after consonants (as in happier and happiest, from happy).|$|R
25|$|The {{evolution}} of grass brought a remarkable {{change to the}} Earth's landscape, and the new open spaces created pushed mammals to get <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>bigger.</b> Grass started to expand in the Miocene, and the Miocene is where many modern- day mammals first appeared. Giant ungulates like Paraceratherium and Deinotherium evolved to rule the grasslands. The {{evolution of}} grass also brought primates down from the trees, and started human evolution. The first big cats evolved during this time as well. The Tethys Sea was closed off by the collision of Africa and Europe.|$|E
25|$|Bottom-up approach: Once we {{formulate}} {{the solution}} to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>bigger</b> sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if we already know the values of F41 and F40, we can directly calculate the value of F42.|$|E
25|$|Both {{began to}} grow {{affections}} for each other during their later years. Gojong was pressured by his advisers {{to take control of}} the government and administer his nation. However, one has to remember that Gojong was not chosen to become King because of his acumen (which he lacked because he was never formally educated) or because of his bloodline (which was mixed with courtesan and common blood), but because the Pungyang Jo clan had falsely assumed they could control the boy through his father. When it was actually time for Gojong to assume his responsibilities of the state, he often needed the aid of his wife to conduct international and domestic affairs. In this, Gojong grew an admiration for his wife's wit, intelligence, and ability to learn quickly. As the problems of the kingdom grew <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>bigger,</b> Gojong relied even more on his wife, she becoming his rock during times of frustration.|$|E

25|$|In early 2009, French forces {{embarked}} on a significant campaign which aimed to retake an eastern Alasay District that the Taliban has controlled for the previous year. Alasay district is a strategic goldmine: it lies along a primary infiltration route {{into and out of}} Pakistan, it provides easy access to Kabul in an easily defensible primary valley (there are two other valleys in Alasay District), and it is mostly populated by the ethnic minority the Pashai and some Nuristani. In a French-led NATO force initiated, the operation was a success initially, due to reaching out to locals beforehand, they retook the entire valley with a single casualty over a single day of fighting. Almost immediately, the Afghans of the valley welcomed the French, and things seemed to be looking up. However, they didn’t stay. Much as in previous efforts to “sweep” the province, the French were dragged into other tasks, like protecting the main highway that travels the province from north to south through the volatile Tagab Valley. As a result, Alasay fell back to Taliban later that year and the security situation in the province deteriorated. It was that same tug-of-war all over again, with the residents of Alasay left frustrated and less safe than ever before. As 2009 progressed, <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>bigger</b> chunks of the province came under the sway of the insurgency, leading the provincial capital being more or less under curfew from the militants. By 2010, the French had stopped liaising with their Afghan Army counterparts, and the Provincial Reconstruction Team had ceased most of its operations.|$|E

500|$|Hosseini {{first began}} to {{consider}} the plot of And the Mountains Echoed during a 2007 trip to Afghanistan with the UN Refugee Agency. While there, he heard stories from several village elders about the deaths of young, impoverished children during the winters, which gave {{the foundation for the}} fundamental event of the novel: a parent's choice to sell a child to prevent this from occurring. [...] "The novel began very, very small, and it began with a single image in my head that I simply could not shed," [...] he relayed. [...] "It was the image of a man walking across the desert and he's pulling a little Radio Flyer red wagon, and in it there's a little girl about 3 years old, and there's a boy walking behind him, and these three people are walking across the desert." [...] Hosseini originally planned for it to be written in a linear fashion similar to his previous novels, but, during the writing process, it was expanded to cover a series of interconnected stories surrounding a large number of characters not directly related to each other. Comparing the process to a tree, he stated that story [...] "just branched out" [...] and [...] "got <b>bigger</b> <b>and</b> <b>bigger</b> as it went along".|$|E

40|$|<b>BIG</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>BIG</b> 1 {{are closely}} related guanine-nucleotide {{exchange}} factors (GEFs) for ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) and {{are involved in the}} regulation of membrane traffic through activating ARFs and recruiting coat protein complexes, such as the COPI complex and the AP- 1 clathrin adaptor complex. Although both ARF-GEFs are associated mainly with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) <b>and</b> <b>BIG</b> 2 is also associated with recycling endosomes, it is unclear whether <b>BIG</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>BIG</b> 1 share some roles in membrane traffic. We here show that knockdown of both <b>BIG</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>BIG</b> 1 by RNAi causes mislocalization of a subset of proteins associated with the TGN and recycling endosomes and blocks retrograde transport of furin from late endosomes to the TGN. Similar mislocalization and protein transport block, including furin, were observed in cells depleted of AP- 1. Taken together with previous reports, these observations indicate that <b>BIG</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>BIG</b> 1 play redundant roles in trafficking between the TGN and endosomes that involves the AP- 1 complex...|$|R
