40|$|This {{technical}} note describes factors affecting batch leaching of metals from dredged material. Factors evaluated include time of sediment-water contact, sedi-ment salinity regime, and sediment oxidation status. Background Contaminated dredged material is often placed in confined disposal facilities where movement of contaminants by leachate {{is an important}} environmental con-cern. No laboratory testing protocol has been routinely applied to predict leachate quality and quantity from confined dredged material disposal facilities. In 1984, the US Army Corps of Engineers initiated investigations of confined disposal facility (CDF) leachate by developing a theoretical framework for prediction of leachate quality based on mass transport theory. The theoretical framework in-cluded both batch and column testing in an integrated approach. Batch testing provides a quick, relatively easy method for determining the distribution of con-taminants between dredged material and leachate. Equilibrium distribution (partitioning) coefficients derived from <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> can then be used to relate leachate contaminant concentrations to solid phase contaminant concentrations. Column testing more closely approximates contaminant losses under field condi-tions in a CDF than do <b>batch</b> <b>tests.</b> Leachate results predicted by <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> {{can be compared to}} those observed from column leaching experiments by combining column tests results, distribution coefficients from <b>batch</b> <b>tests,</b> and mass transport theory.

Until recently these two values were assumed equal in activated sludge models, despite theoretical predictions that the anoxic yield should be reduced relative to its aerobic value. In this study, parallel aerobic and anoxic <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> {{were conducted on}} the same mixtures of wastewater and mixed liquor drawn from anoxic-aerobic activated sludge systems. By equating the readily biodegradable (RB) COD concentrations in the aerobic and anoxic <b>batch</b> <b>tests,</b> the anoxic yield was determined {{in terms of the}} respective measured oxygen and nitrate utilizations and the aerobic yield.

40|$|In this study, a {{collector}} combination between xanthate and a fatty acid collector (Betacol 364) is tested on an ore containing chalcopyrite, pentlandite and pyrrhotite. An {{increase in the}} rate of pentlandite and pyrrhotite recovery was measured when the fatty acid and xanthate combination was tested against the baseline (xanthate as sole collector), using the standard laboratory scale <b>batch</b> flotation <b>test</b> procedure. The rate of mineral recovery in a <b>batch</b> flotation <b>test</b> is not only influenced by particle floatability, but also by the amount of air bubble surface area available in the pulp and the recovery of value mineral from the flotation froth. This is given as =.. where k is the rate constant (min- 1), P is a parameter which represents the floatability of a mineral, Rf is the froth recovery factor and Sb bubble surface area flux. A test unit developed for this study (based on the Bikerman foam test) indicated that the fatty acid collector used (Betacol 364) has froth stabilising characteristics and thus may have increased the froth recovery (Rf) during the <b>batch</b> flotation <b>test.</b> The increase {{in the rate of}} pyrrhotite recovery measured can therefore not only be explained by an increase in pyrrhotite floatability. In a case where the <b>batch</b> flotation <b>tests</b> are followed by plant testing and the rate of flotation increase measured during the <b>batch</b> <b>test</b> was only or partially {{as a result of an}} increase in froth recovery (Rf), the <b>batch</b> <b>test</b> would be an unreliable test to predict plant performance. Plant operators have many variables available to manage froth recovery (Rf), for example pulp level and frother dosing rate. For a laboratory scale <b>batch</b> <b>test</b> to be a reliable test for predicting a rate increase in plant recovery, it is necessary that an increase in the rate of recovery will be as a result of an increase in particle floatability (P). It is recommended that {{a collector}} <b>batch</b> flotation <b>test</b> campaign must include a test to measure if the collector has frothing characteristics. The Bikerman froth stability column is demonstrated as a possible test to measure if a collector has froth stabilising characteristics. The Bikerman froth stability column test method confirmed that the fatty acid collector tested (Betacol 364) has froth stabilising properties. Additional tests are therefore recommended to confirm that the rate of recovery increase measured is as a result of an increase in pyrrhotite and pentlandite floatability (P). Micro flotation tests performed on pyrrhotite mineral specimens confirmed that a combination between Xanthate and Betacol 364 increases the particle floatability (P) of pyrrhotite. Laboratory scale flotation tests performed on artificial ores, consisting of a mixture of quartz and pyrrhotite mineral specimens, confirmed that the combination of Betacol 364 and xanthate increases the floatability of pyrrhotite (P).
