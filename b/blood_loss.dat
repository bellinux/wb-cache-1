5|$|Coyotes {{typically}} {{bite the}} throat {{just behind the}} jaw and below the ear when attacking adult sheep or goats, with death commonly resulting from suffocation. <b>Blood</b> <b>loss</b> is usually a secondary cause of death. Calves and heavily fleeced sheep are killed by attacking the flanks or hindquarters, causing shock and <b>blood</b> <b>loss.</b> When attacking smaller prey, such as young lambs, the kill is made by biting the skull and spinal regions, causing massive tissue and bone damage. Small or young prey may be completely carried off, leaving only blood as evidence of a kill. Coyotes usually leave the hide {{and most of the}} skeleton of larger animals relatively intact, unless food is scarce, in which case they may leave only the largest bones. Scattered bits of wool, skin, and other parts are characteristic where coyotes feed extensively on larger carcasses.|$|E
5|$|A host of {{different}} animals, including snapping turtles, snake {{species such as}} Nerodia sipedon and Thamnophis sirtalis, muskrats, striped skunks, foxes, dogs, and raccoons prey upon the bog turtle. In addition, leeches (Placobdella multilineata and P. parasitica) and parasitic flies (Cistudinomyia cistudinis) plague some individuals, causing <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> and weakness. Their shells offer little protection from predators. The bog turtle's main defense when threatened by an animal is to bury itself in soft mud. It rarely defends its territory or bites when approached.|$|E

40|$|A defective, {{normal or}} {{enhanced}} hemostasis {{has been reported}} in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). A retrospective analysis of intra-and postoperative (up to 36 h) estimated <b>blood</b> <b>losses</b> was performed in 156 patients undergoing spinal surgery for: DMD (n = 31), idiopathic scoliosis (IS) (n = 70), poliomyelitis (n = 10), cerebral palsy (CP) (n = 28), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (n = 17). Platelet aggregation and bleeding times were also investigated in DMD patients. Immunohistochemistry for dystrophin was performed in platelets, megakaryocytes and blood vessels of normal tissues. DMD patients showed significantly higher intraoperative estimated <b>blood</b> <b>losses</b> (DMD: 3495 +/- 890 ml; IS: 2269 +/- 804 ml; poliomyelitis: 2582 +/- 1252 ml; CP: 2071 +/- 683 ml; SMA: 2464 +/- 806 ml; P < 0. 05), while postoperative <b>blood</b> <b>losses</b> were similar among different groups. Higher estimated <b>blood</b> <b>losses</b> in DMD were independent of the duration of surgery, body weight, gender, age, vertebral levels or preoperative Cobb angle. DMD children had significantly prolonged bleeding times, but retained normal platelet function. From control samples dystrophin was expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, but not in platelets. DMD appears to be characterized by immediate bleeding during highly-invasive surgery and increased bleeding time without platelet abnormalities. Considering dystrophin expression in normal vascular smooth muscle cells, these results altogether suggest a selective defect of primary hemostasis in DMD, likely to be due to impaired vessel reactivit...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} model for calculating hematocrit {{as it relates}} to <b>blood</b> volume <b>loss</b> was used to test the theoretical impact of acute normovolemic hemodilution prior to surgery in a chronically anemic patient.

The main cause of anaemia is iron deficiency. In United States women iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 37% of pregnant women, but globally the prevalence is as high as 80%.

40|$|PURPOSE: Hypoparathyroidism and {{paralysis}} of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) {{still remain}} {{the most frequent}} specific complications of thyroid surgery. This study evaluates the effects of employment of a recently introduced device (LigaSure™ Small Jaw, LSJ), compared to the traditional clamp-and-tie (CT) technique, on the short- and long-term outcome of the patients who underwent thyroidectomy. METHODS: This prospective, randomized study included 190 patients enrolled from October 2011 to July 2013. The numbers of patients in the LSJ group and the CT group were both 95. We studied the following: operative times, intraoperative and postoperative <b>blood</b> <b>losses,</b> intact parathormone (iPTH) and calcium serum levels, and the incidence of RLN paralysis. RESULTS: The two cohorts were homogeneous for age, sex, surgical indication, BMI, ASA score, and estimated thyroid volume. Operation time has been 73. 90 [*]±[*] 23. 35 min in group CT and 60. 20 [*]±[*] 22. 36 min in group LSJ (p[*]=[*] 0. 002). Intraoperative <b>blood</b> <b>losses</b> have been 47 [*]±[*] 18 ml in group CT and 38 [*]±[*] 14 in group LSJ (p[*]=[*] 0. 002), while postoperative <b>blood</b> <b>losses</b> have been 45 [*]±[*] 21 ml in group CT and 40 [*]±[*] 20 in group LSJ (p[*]=[*] 0. 105). The mean calcium blood level in group CT has been 8. 12, 7. 79, and 7. 92 mg/dl in the first, second, and third postoperative days, respectively, as well as 8. 26, 7. 97, and 8. 22 mg/dl for group LSJ (p[*]>[*] 0. 05). Basal and post-thyroidectomy iPTH levels have been 46. 49 and 23. 64 pg/ml in group CT (Δ[*]=[*] 49. 15 %), as well as 51. 06 and 27. 73 (Δ[*]=[*] 45. 69 %) in group LSJ (p[*]>[*] 0. 05). Permanent RLN paralysis was 1. 05 % in LSJ group and 0 % in CT group.

5|$|Several {{conclusions}} {{were drawn}} from discussions between Patel and the CPS, Starmer said: (a) because Patel had not retained or sampled the three litres of fluid, no firm conclusions could be drawn {{about the nature of}} it; (b) for Tomlinson's death to have resulted so quickly from <b>blood</b> <b>loss,</b> there would have to have been a significant internal rupture; (c) Patel found no such rupture; (d) the later postmortems also found no visible rupture; and (e) because Patel was the only person to have examined Tomlinson's intact body, he was {{in the best position to}} judge the nature of the fluid, and whether there was a rupture that could have caused it. This meant that Patel's evidence would significantly undermine the evidence of the second and third pathologists.|$|E
5|$|The artery is only {{present in}} {{approximately}} 3–10% of the population.

Knowledge of occurrence of the artery is especially important during tracheostomy and thyroidectomy. Because the artery is smaller than the other thyroid vessels, and having an origin {{from one of the}} bigger vessels, a brisk cut while performing the surgery may cause complications such as severe hemorrhage and significant <b>blood</b> <b>loss.</b> The artery, if dissected, may draw back into the mediastinum and further complicate the condition by causing hemorrhage and clots in the thoracic cavity.|$|E
30|$|Because {{of limited}} availability, costs and safety {{concerns}} related to blood transfusion, several strategies to reduce blood transfusions {{can be considered}} in addition to increasing transfusion trigger thresholds. These include approaches to reduce <b>blood</b> <b>losses,</b> for example use of antifibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid or epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and techniques of cell salvage during surgery; also, the use of small volume sample tubes can limit the <b>blood</b> <b>losses</b> related to sampling for laboratory studies. In a meta-analysis of 9 randomized controlled trials [87], subcutaneous administration of recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) in critically ill patients was shown {{to be associated with}} decreased transfusion rates, but this was not associated with improved mortality (except possibly in a subgroup of trauma patients [88]). Concerns also have been raised about potentially increased rates of deep vein thrombosis [88]. The development of artificial oxygen carriers is under investigation, but these have their own problems [89]. Further research is needed to improve these alternative strategies.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Isotonic crystalloids play {{a central}} role in {{perioperative}} fluid management. Isooncotic preparations of colloids (for example, human albumin or hydroxyethyl starch) remain nearly completely intravascular when infused to compensate for acute <b>blood</b> <b>losses.</b> Recent data were interpreted to indicate a comparable intravascular volume effect for crystalloids, challenging the occasionally suggested advantage of using colloids to treat hypovolemia.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundCytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic {{intraperitoneal}} chemotherapy (HIPEC) by {{the closed}} technique provide a promising therapeutic option for highly selected patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. CRS with HIPEC {{is a long}} and complex procedure with significant <b>blood</b> and fluid <b>loss,</b> hemodynamic, hematological, and metabolic alterations in the perioperative period, with resultant morbidity and mortality. This work was done to evaluate our early experience in anesthesia and early postoperative care for these cases. Patients and methodsThis retrospective study was done on 13 patients for CRS and HIPEC, with intraoperative and early postoperative recording and evaluation of the fluid and <b>blood</b> <b>losses</b> and replacement, changes in hemodynamic, metabolic, and respiratory parameters and any complications happened. ResultsOur data demonstrated high fluid and <b>blood</b> <b>losses</b> during CRS. During HIPEC, raised body temperature, increased central venous pressure and airway pressure, increased arterial partial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2), decreased ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure/fractional inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2), and increased serum lactate were recorded. These were associated with hemodynamic, metabolic, and respiratory acidosis. The patients were continuing resuscitation and correction of any derangements in intensive care unit. ConclusionCRS and HIPEC have become standard treatment for certain peritoneal surface malignancies. This extended surgery is considered a challenge for the anesthetist. It is associated with relevant fluid, <b>blood,</b> and protein <b>losses,</b> together with hemodynamic, respiratory, and metabolic derangements. However, these derangements are short lived and could be controlled by continuous monitoring and rapid intervention...|$|R

5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} by brown-headed cowbirds is common, {{with up to}} 25% of Carolina wren nests {{being affected}} in certain regions such as Oklahoma and Alabama. Cowbird parasitism peaks in April at 41%, and is as low as 8% and 0% in July and August, respectively. Female cowbirds sometimes eject Carolina wren eggs before laying their own, and even if host eggs are retained, the size of cowbird eggs negatively affect the hatching success of wren eggs. As a result, cowbirds may {{have a significant impact}} on the reproductive success of wrens. The feeding rate for cowbird nestlings is higher than wren feeding rates, and some have been raised to independence. This also can be detrimental to the survival of wren nestlings. A rare instance of brood-parasitism by a house finch has been recorded. The rate of brood parasitism is thought to be lower in more natural and concealed nesting locations. Body parasites such as the larvae of blowflies feed on nestlings and the <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> weakens nestlings. Fellow species of wren such as Bewick's wren and the winter wren compete for nesting locations and food, respectively.|$|E

5|$|If the {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} falls below 90 mmHg {{within days of the}} injury, blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced, resulting in further damage. Thus it is important to maintain the blood pressure using a central venous catheter, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors, and to treat cases of shock. Mean arterial blood pressure is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg for seven days after injury. The treatment for shock from <b>blood</b> <b>loss</b> (hypovolemic shock) is different from that for neurogenic shock, and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why someone is in shock. However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time. Another important aspect of care is prevention of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream), which could deprive the spinal cord of much-needed oxygen. People with cervical injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate; treatment to speed it up include atropine and electrical cardiac pacing.|$|E
5|$|Rovelizumab, trade-named LeukArrest {{and also}} known as Hu23F2G, was {{developed}} to treat patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock, which is caused by massive <b>blood</b> <b>loss.</b> The drug is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the recruitment of white blood cells {{to the site of}} inflammation. During testing, few patients were given the drug, because LeukArrest had to be administered within four hours of the injury and informed consent was required; patients were often unconscious, and relatives had to be reached to give consent. In June1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the FDA to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August1998 for five medical centers. Development of LeukArrest was halted in April2000 when interim data from phaseIII clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals of significantly reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death rate from shock at 28days. LeukArrest was also tested unsuccessfully for treatment of heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.|$|E

3000|$|Interestingly, anemia and {{the need}} to restore {{adequate}} oxygen delivery (DO 2) are the most common indications for transfusion, rather than acute bleeding [3, 5 – 10]. Anemia in the critically ill patient is a multifactorial phenomenon that has been compared to the so-called [...] "anemia of chronic illness" [...] [11]. Apart from evident causes of anemia, such as primary <b>blood</b> <b>losses</b> (e.g., trauma, surgery, gastrointestinal bleeding), multiple other etiologies contribute to its pathophysiology and often coexist in the same patient [11]. These include <b>blood</b> <b>losses</b> related to minor procedures or phlebotomy, and hemodilution secondary to fluid resuscitation. Some studies have suggested that blood sampling may average as much as 40 ml/day [3, 4], but the amount of blood required may decrease with technological developments in analytic methods. Other mechanisms for anemia include an inflammatory response with blunted erythropoietin (EPO) production, abnormalities in iron metabolism, and altered proliferation and differentiation of medullar erythroid precursors [11]. As a consequence, RBC deformability is decreased [12], whereas RBC adherence to the endothelium is increased, especially in septic patients, potentially leading to microcirculatory impairment and tissue hypoxia [13].|$|R
