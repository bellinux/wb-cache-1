Levodopa brought about a revolution in the management of PD.

50|$|Nicandra physalodes {{contains}} nicandrenones, a {{group of}} the steroidal lactones known as withanolides. The nicandrenones, like certain other types of withanolide, have insecticidal properties. 30 years after their discovery, the first total synthesis of nicandrenones {{was carried out in}} the year 2000.Amongst its other paradoxical attributes, N. physalodes is also slightly intoxicating, showing a certain degree of psychoactivity of a type similar to that elicited by the tropane alkaloid hyoscyamine (well {{known as one of the}} active principles present in the notoriously toxic nightshades Hyoscyamus niger and Atropa belladonna and causing mydriasis - a symptom said also to be caused by the alkaloids present in Nicandra).This property of the plant is reflected in one of the common names given it in France (namely belladonne de pays i.e. 'country belladonna') and likewise in the common name <b>belladona</b> given it in Bolivia. It is not yet known whether this mild psychoactivity is referable to the alkaloid content or the withanolide content (or possibly to both - or indeed a synergy between the two). Like its more toxic relatives, Nicandra physalodes is alkaloidal, analyses having revealed the presence of the tropane alkaloid tropinone and the pyrrolidine alkaloid hygrine (0.1%, in the root). Withanolides are found almost exclusively in plants of the Solanaceae and, while it is noticeable that many psychoactive species belonging to that family contain only, or primarily, such compounds, not a single withanolide has yet been proven to be psychoactive. The compounds are named for the Solanaceous genus Withania, the best-known species of which, Withania somnifera, is, as its specific name suggests, mildly psychoactive to the extent of being sleep-inducing (among other useful medicinal properties). The use of W.somnifera (common name (i.a.) 'Indian ginseng') as a tonic (adaptogen) in Ayurvedic medicine parallels the use of Nicandra as an adaptogen in traditional Tibetan medicine (see above, under 'Uses') and is accounted for by withanolide content. Also present in Nicandra are calystegines, a new group of polyhydroxy alkaloids with a nortropane skeleton and named for the bindweed genus Calystegia (Convolvulaceae). Their occurrence has been noted in several species of the Solanaceae, including Atropa belladonna. The biosynthesis of these compounds is thought to take place via the tropane alkaloid pathway, the first metabolite being pseudotropine.|$|E

40|$|M. Tech. (Homoeopathy) Abstract: Onychocryptosis (ingrown toenail) is {{a painful}} {{condition}} of the toe that commonly affects the big toenail (hallux) (Tharu, 2014). It occurs when {{the edge of the}} toenail penetrates into the skin resulting in pain, erythema (redness), oedema (swelling), and sometimes leads to infections (Filippone, 2005). Although, there are no statistics on the number of people suffering from onychocryptosis in South Africa up to date, according to the World Health Organization, 7. 1 million of people suffer from onychocryptosis in America alone (Rightdiagnosis, 2015). Conventional treatment for onychocryptosis is rendered by podiatrists and can be performed either surgically or non-surgically depending on the severity of the condition. However, these approaches may be quite painful, invasive and costly, and the condition may reoccur. Previous studies showed that Magnetis polus australis 30 cH and 1 M used orally had some success in treating onychocryptosis (Rohl, 2008; Khan, 2012). Anecdotal evidence suggests that patients often apply their homoeopathic remedy topically and claim that it is effective; and Rohl (2008) recommended that research be conducted on topical applications. The following homoeopathic remedies Apis mellifica, Atopa <b>belladona,</b> Hepar sulphuris calcareum, Magnetis polus australis and Silicea are all indicated for symptoms associated with onychocryptosis (Vermeulen, 2011). However, there is no research done to date to establish their effectiveness when used as a topical complex remedy on onychocryptosis. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the efficacy of a topical homoeopathic complex hydrogel (Apis mellifica 6 cH, Atropa <b>belladona</b> 6 cH, Hepar sulphuris calcareum 6 cH, Magnetis polus australis 30 cH and Silicea 6 cH) on stage one onychocryptosis of the hallux, and a Likert scale was used to measure pain on pressure, erythema, and oedema. This study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study and was conducted at the Podiatric clinic of the University of Johannesburg (Appendix B) for a period of thirty days and included three appointments. On the first day of the study the potential participants were requested to read a Participant Information Form (Appendix C) and sign a Consent Form (Appendix D). The researcher screened the participants using a questionnaire (Appendix E) to evaluate their suitability for the study and a podiatrist confirmed their stage of onychocryptosis. For selected participants, the researcher examined the participant’s onychocryptosis to assess the degree of oedema, erythema and pain on pressure and rated these using a Researcher Assessment Form (Appendix [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} and develop integrated crop management systems in organic glasshouse tomato production. The different management strategies that were used were tomato hybrid choice, grafting onto pest and disease resistant rootstocks, different fertiliser input types applied at several N-levels, steam disinfection of the soil substrate, chitin soil amendments and Milsana foliar disease control treatments. Four different experiments investigated {{the effects of these}} factors, as well as interactions between them, on the severity of a foliar disease Powdery mildew (Leveillula taurica), a soil-borne disease Corky root rot (Pyrenochaeta lycopersici) and nematodes infestation (Meloidogyne spp.). Tomato plant growth and yield parameters were also recorded in order to distinguish how the management practices that control plant pathogens affect growth and yield. Tomatoes are an important and significant source of nutrients and secondary metabolites which give a range of health benefits since many of the tomato micro constituents show antioxidative properties and have been linked with reduced risk of various forms of cancer and heart diseases. However, {{there is some evidence that}} the quality of tomato fruit is affected by hybrid choice, fertility management practices, grafting onto resistant rootstocks and the ripening stage at harvest. Therefore, tomato samples harvested from different trusses and at different ripening stages were analysed for quality parameters namely sugars, dry matter content and total antioxidant concentration. Of the two hybrids used in this experiment, <b>Belladona</b> plants grew slightly faster than 984 and produced many small fruit, while 984 plants produced fewer but bigger and heavier fruit. However, Belladonna and 984 did not show significant differences in their hydrophilic antioxidant activity although 984 fruit had higher sugar and dry matter content than <b>Belladona</b> fruit. Grafting onto the different rootstocks had beneficial effects on plant growth and reduced nematodes and corky root rot severity, but there were no significant effects on fruit antioxidants. The rootstock He-man F 1 whilst shown to be more resistant against nematodes than R- 5872 F 1, was merely tolerant against corky root rot infection. On the other hand, the two rootstocks used had different effects on yield parameters. Grafting onto R- 5872 F 1 resulted in production of a larger number of smaller fruits, whilst grafting onto He-man F 1 resulted in fewer, but bigger and heavier fruit.

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi determinar o comportamento de variedades de laranjas-doces quanto à resistência a Guignardia citricarpa, agente causal da mancha preta dos citros (MPC). Os ensaios foram conduzidos em dois campos, nos municípios de Rincão e Tambaú, SP. As mudas foram formadas em viveiro localizado na Estação Experimental de Citricultura de Bebedouro-SP. Para tal, foram utilizadas borbulhas de plantas cítricas existentes no Banco Ativo de Germoplasma de Citros da Estação Experimental de Citricultura de Bebedouro (EECB), Bebedouro-SP. Avaliou-se a severidade da doença por meio de escala de notas, de zero (ausência de sintomas) a seis (sintomas severos). A partir de tais dados, foi calculado o valor do índice de doença (ID). Em 2007, no experimento de Rincão, dentre as 65 variedades avaliadas, apenas 59 produziram frutos, sendo constatada ausência de sintomas da doença em Castellana, Maçã e Olivelands. Nas demais variedades, os níveis de severidade variaram de 0, 35 para Grada a 3, 0 para China SRA- 547. Para Tambaú, os valores de severidade variaram de 0, 40 para a variedade Cadenera a 2, 46 para Pera. No ano de 2008, em Rincão, todas as variedades mostraram-se suscetíveis. Os níveis de severidade verificados variaram de 0, 18 para a variedade <b>Belladona,</b> e 3, 92 para Vera 97. Em Tambaú, somente a variedade Navelina não apresentou sintomas da MPC. Foi observado que, dentre as plantas que frutificaram, e com exceção daquelas cujos frutos mostraram-se assintomáticos, os valores de severidade variaram de 0, 11 para a variedade Tua Mamede a 3, 57 para Amares. The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the variety behavior of sweet oranges as to their resistance to Guignardia citricarpa, a causal agent of citrus black spot (CBS). The tests were conducted in two fields in the cities of Rincão and Tambaú, SP. The seedlings were formed in a nursery located in the Experimental Station of Citriculture (EECB) in Bebedouro, SP. For this, citrus plant buds present in the Active Bank of Citrus Germoplasm (EEBC), were used. The severity of the disease was evaluated by using a grade scale from zero (absence of symptoms) to six (maximum severity). Using this data the disease index (DI) was calculated. In the 2007 harvest, the tests in Rincão showed that only 59 out of the 65 varieties evaluated produced fruit, verifying the absence of the disease symptoms in Castellana, Maçã and Olivelands. In the other varieties, the severity levels vary between 0. 35 in Grada, and 3. 0 in China SRA- 547. In Tambaú, the severity values varied from 0. 40 in Cadenera, and 2. 46 in Pêra. In 2008, all of the varieties in Rincão showed to be susceptible. The severity levels verified, varied from 0. 18 in <b>Belladona</b> and 3. 92 in Vera 97.

40|$|According to the literature, {{the tobacco}} plant {{is native to}} Central and South America. With over fifty varieties, tobacco belongs to the {{nightshade}} family which includes <b>belladona</b> (deadly nightshade), peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, and okra (also called lady fingers) 8 - 9. Two varieties of tobacco interest us here. One is Nicotiana rustica, or “true tobacc ”, which was used by Native peoples in the Americas long {{before the arrival of}} Europeans. This variety, although not native to North America, has adapted successfully to the climate. Com ercial tobacco such as the one used in cigarettes, is Nicotiana tabacum which was originally grown in South and Central America but was later cultivated success-fully in Virginia where it became a major cash crop 1. “True tobacco”, a milder form than the tobacco used in commercial tobacco products, was widely regarded by North American Indians as a sacred plant and was often cultivated separately from other crops involving specific rituals for sowing and harvesting. It was used in a great number of ceremonies as an essential element of ritual. It could be burnt over the fire, thrown on water, left on the ground or smoked in a pipe that was passed around a circle of people or in individual pipes. In South and Central America where the stronger, larger- leafed Non-Traditional use of Nicotiana Tabacum grew, Indians smoked tobacco in pipes of many shapes and sized, or in the form of cones or “smoking rolls”, sometimes elaborately decorated.

Three {{hundred and twenty}} (44. 4 %) were syrups and 400 (55. 6 %) were mixtures. Total viable aerobic count for the formulations were determined using the plate count method, and the organisms isolated were identified by conventional microbiological/biochemical methods. The study revealed that microbial growth in mixtures was 49. 0 % and in syrups 42. 8 %; however, this difference was not significant. Different organisms were identified from the two formulations and their distribution pattern {{was found to be}} significantly different. It was shown that Gram-negative rods were found only in mixtures. Potential pathogens isolated were found more in mixtures (10. 5 %) than in syrups (0. 3 %). Mixtures of Magnesium trisilicate, Kaolin and <b>Belladona,</b> contained more potential pathogens as compared {{to the rest of the}} mixtures.

In view of the above findings, it is recommended that the authorities responsible for issuing of licences for drug manufacturing should be more strict, and adherence to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) should be emphasized. In addition, every manufacturing unit must have a functioning water purification system, and there should be frequent inspection of the microbial quality of locally manufactured drug formulations. Strong warning should be given for non-compliance and if necessary legal action be taken.

40|$|The dark-sided cutworm, Euxoa messoria (Harr.) was reared under {{laboratory}} {{conditions on}} 8 artificial diets, a meridic diet containing various concentrations {{of one of}} the alkaloids, veratrine, berberine, nicotine, or atropine, and on two varieties of Nicotiana tabacum, Lonibow and Delhi- 34. Observations of the development times, larval and pupal weights, survival, and number and widths of head capsules were recorded. Feeding preference studies were carried out to look at possible food choice mechanisms used by the larvae. Larvae showed quantitative requirements for ascorbic acid and cholesterol. Soybean protein was unsuitable as the sole protein source but it did supplement casein. Wheat germ provided an unknown nutritional quality to the diet which improved developmental characteristics. Chronic exposure to alkaloid diets demonstrated that survival and developmental characteristics are variously affected by the source and concentration of alkaloid. Larvae demonstrated a tolerance to levels of 0. 01 %, 0. 03 %, and 0. 1 %, berberine; 0. 01 %, and 0. 03 % nicotine; and 0. 01 %, 0. 03 % and 0. 1 % atropine. Atropine at all levels tested enhanced survival and larval size. Detrimental effects on growth, development rates survival and/or number of instars were observed in larvae fed dietary levels of 0. 3 % and 1. 0 % berberine; 0. 1 %, 0. 3 %, and 1. 0 % nicotine; 0. 3 % and 1. 0 % atropine; and 0. 01 %, 0. 03 %, 0. 1 %, and 0. 3 %, and 1. 0 % veratrine, indicating that this insect is susceptible to these compounds at these levels. Larvae were most sensitive to the detrimental (or antibiosis) effects of the alkaloids berberine and nicotine {{in the early stages of}} development. There was a degree of plasticity observed in the duration of the prepupal period which Allowed the development rates of individuals fed various levels of an alkaloid to become synchronized, thus ensuring that the adults emerged at roughly the same time. The developmental characteristics of larvae fed two varieties of N. tabacum, Lonibow and Delhi- 34, indicated that Delhi- 34 shows some resistance to the larvae by decreasing survival, larval and pupal sizes, and increasing the development times. E. messoria demonstrates a definite preference for some food sources over others, and responds to both nutritive and secondary plant compounds in making a choice. Sucrose, nicotine, and atropine are phagostimulants to the larvae while berberine (at 0. 03 %, 0. 1 %, 0. 3 %, and 1. 0 %) and veratrine (at all levels tested) are feeding deterrents. The threshold level for the antifeedant effect of berberine appears to be 0. 01 %. Response to the alkaloids seems to be dependant upon the presence of nutrient compounds. Sucrose mixed with atropine had a synergistic effect on the feeding response. Larvae show a preference for some varieties and species of Nicotiana, and strongly preferred Atropa <b>belladona</b> over tobacco. Both the antennae and maxillary palps are involved in host selection. Responses by maxillectomized larvae suggest that sucrose receptors are located on the maxillary palps and in the buccal cavity, and that the receptors responsible for the synergistic effect of sucrose and atropine are also on the maxillary palps. The presence of the maxillary palps appears to be essential for feeding to occur. Larval preference for a food source does not guarantee the choice of a diet which is suitable for normal growth and development...|$|E
