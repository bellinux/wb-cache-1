5|$|Mimicry systems {{involving}} {{only two}} species {{are known as}} <b>bipolar.</b> Only one <b>bipolar</b> arrangement is possible here: that's where the dupe is itself the model. There are two such variants on this arrangement of mimic imitating its target, in the first case, termed Batesian-Wallacian mimicry after Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace, the model is the prey species. In the second case, the model {{is the host of}} a brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} {{prolific}} {{writing in the}} 1960s, Ochs's mental stability declined in the 1970s. He eventually succumbed {{to a number of}} problems including <b>bipolar</b> disorder and alcoholism, and committed suicide in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Controller {{advances}} have exploited dramatic {{increases in the}} voltage and current ratings and switching frequency of solid-state power devices {{over the past six}} decades. Introduced in 1983, the insulated-gate <b>bipolar</b> transistor (IGBT) has {{in the past two decades}} come to dominate VFDs as an inverter switching device.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner's health {{first became}} {{a topic of}} public concern in 2005 when Noticias {{magazine}} reported that she might suffer from <b>bipolar</b> disorder. Journalist Franco Lindner interviewed the psychiatrist who treated her without revealing his name. Journalist Nelson Castro investigated further and discovered that the psychiatrist was Alejandro Lagomarsino, who died in 2011. Lagomarsino was the leading specialist {{in the treatment of}} <b>bipolar</b> disorder in Argentina. Castro's investigation revealed that Kirchner was treated by Lagomarsino for a short period. He could not determine the length of her treatment or the medicine she received, or whether another psychiatrist continued treating her or not. Castro considers that some of her outlandish phrases or projects, and her frequent periods of hiding from public view, may be explained by the disorder's periods of mania and depression, as well as being a regular political strategy. Eduardo Duhalde said that Néstor Kirchner once confided in him that she had a <b>bipolar</b> disorder, while she was having a violent outburst. During the United States diplomatic cables leak it was revealed that Hillary Clinton questioned Kirchner's mental health and asked the US embassy whether she was receiving treatment or not; she later apologized to Kirchner for those leaks. Kirchner said in her book La Presidenta that it was all a misunderstanding; it is her sister who suffers from <b>bipolar</b> disorder.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{is present}} in {{biological}} systems in trace amounts; its functions are uncertain. Lithium salts {{have proven to be}} useful as a mood-stabilizing drug in the treatment of <b>bipolar</b> disorder in humans.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{naturally}} only {{occurs in}} traces in biological systems {{and has no}} known biological role, but does have effects on the body when ingested. Lithium carbonate {{is used as a}} mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat <b>bipolar</b> disorder (manic-depression) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2grams, although there are side-effects. Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness, slurred speech and vomiting, among other symptoms, and poisons the central nervous system, which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat <b>bipolar</b> disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage. Its biochemistry, the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element, although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified.|$|E
5|$|Parts of the {{otic vesicle}} in turn form the vestibulocochlear nerve. These form <b>bipolar</b> neurons which supply {{sensation}} {{to parts of}} the inner ear (namely the sensory parts of the semicircular canals, macular of the utricle and saccule, and organ of Corti). The nerve begins to form around the 28th day.|$|E
5|$|Rohling's 2004 <b>Bipolar</b> model {{suggests}} that sea level rise lifted buoyant ice shelves, causing their destabilisation and destruction. Without a floating ice shelf to support them, continental ice sheets would flow out towards the oceans and disintegrate into icebergs and sea ice.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} miRNA dysregulation of gene {{expression}} {{also seem to}} be important in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, <b>bipolar</b> disorder, major depression, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and autism spectrum disorders.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} debates as {{to the nature of}} Van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work, and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning. Perry was the first to suggest <b>bipolar</b> disorder in 1947, and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer. Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, noting that the popular link between <b>bipolar</b> disorder and creativity might be spurious. Temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested. Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Conditions {{that must}} be {{considered}} in a differential diagnosis along with ADHD include other ASDs, the schizophrenia spectrum, personality disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, semantic pragmatic disorder, nonverbal learning disorder, social anxiety disorder, Tourette syndrome, stereotypic movement disorder, <b>bipolar</b> disorder, social-cognitive deficits due to brain damage from alcohol abuse, and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD).|$|E
5|$|In January 1976, Ochs {{moved to}} Far Rockaway, New York, {{to live with}} his sister Sonny. He was lethargic; his only {{activities}} were watching television and playing cards with his nephews. Ochs saw a psychiatrist, who diagnosed his <b>bipolar</b> disorder. He was prescribed medication, and he told his sister he was taking it. On April 9, 1976, Ochs committed suicide by hanging himself in Sonny's home.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{is useful}} in the {{treatment}} of <b>bipolar</b> disorder. Lithium salts may also be helpful for related diagnoses, such as schizoaffective disorder and cyclic major depression. The active part of these salts is the lithium ion Li+. They may increase the risk of developing Ebstein's cardiac anomaly in infants born to women who take lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Mental disorders, such {{as major}} {{depressive}} disorder, schizophrenia, <b>bipolar</b> disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, and addiction, are known {{to relate to the}} functioning of the brain. Treatment for mental disorders may include psychotherapy, psychiatry, social intervention and personal recovery work or cognitive behavioural therapy; the underlying issues and associated prognoses vary significantly between individuals.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, 2012, Jackson took {{a medical}} {{leave of absence}} from the House, citing exhaustion. On July 11, 2012, Jackson's office said he was being treated for a mood {{disorder}} at a residential treatment facility. His office denied speculation that he was being treated for alcoholism. On August 13, 2012 it was confirmed by numerous news outlets that Jackson was being treated for <b>bipolar</b> disorder.|$|E
5|$|Some of McClintock's {{personality}} and scientific achievements {{were referred to}} in Jeffrey Eugenides's 2011 novel The Marriage Plot, which {{tells the story of}} a yeast geneticist named Leonard who suffers from <b>bipolar</b> disorder. He works at a laboratory loosely based on Cold Spring Harbor. The character reminiscent of McClintock is a reclusive geneticist at the fictional laboratory, who makes the same discoveries as her factual counterpart.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{problem with}} antidepressants {{is the chance}} of antidepressant-induced mania in patients with <b>bipolar</b> disorder. Many cases of <b>bipolar</b> depression {{are very similar to}} those of unipolar depression. Therefore, the patient can be misdiagnosed with unipolar depression and be given antidepressants. Studies have shown that antidepressant-induced mania can occur in 20–40% of <b>bipolar</b> patients. For <b>bipolar</b> depression, antidepressants (most frequently SSRIs) can exacerbate or trigger symptoms of hypomania and mania.|$|E
25|$|Lamotrigine is {{approved}} in the US for maintenance treatment of <b>bipolar</b> I disorder and <b>bipolar</b> II disorder. While the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate are predominantly antimanics, lamotrigine {{is most effective}} for preventing the recurrent depressive episodes of <b>bipolar</b> disorder. The drug seems ineffective {{in the treatment of}} current rapid-cycling, acute mania, or acute depression in <b>bipolar</b> disorder; however, it is effective at prevention of or delaying of manic, depressive, or rapid cycling episodes. According to studies in 2007, lamotrigine may treat <b>bipolar</b> depression without triggering mania, hypomania, mixed states, or rapid-cycling.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral genetic {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that many chromosomal regions and candidate genes are related to <b>bipolar</b> disorder susceptibility with each gene exerting a mild to moderate effect. The risk of <b>bipolar</b> disorder is nearly ten-fold higher in first degree-relatives of those affected with <b>bipolar</b> disorder when compared to the general population; similarly, the risk of major depressive disorder is three times higher in relatives of those with <b>bipolar</b> disorder when compared to the general population.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of the}} <b>bipolar</b> option {{does not}} require the {{placement}} of a return electrode because the current only passes between tines of the forceps or other <b>bipolar</b> output device.|$|E
25|$|A study {{looking at}} 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, <b>bipolar</b> disorder, or {{unipolar}} depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions {{for those with}} <b>bipolar</b> disorder {{as well as for}} undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or <b>bipolar</b> disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.|$|E
25|$|The Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) {{recommends}} olanzapine as a {{first line}} maintenance treatment in <b>bipolar</b> disorder and the combination of olanzapine with fluoxetine as second line treatment for <b>bipolar</b> depression.|$|E
25|$|Olanzapine is {{recommended}} by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence as a first line therapy {{for the treatment of}} acute mania in <b>bipolar</b> disorder. Other recommended first lines are haloperidol, quetiapine and risperidone. It {{is recommended}} in combination with fluoxetine as a first line therapy for acute <b>bipolar</b> depression; and as a second line treatment by itself for the maintenance treatment of <b>bipolar</b> disorder.|$|E
25|$|In <b>bipolar</b> disorder, SGAs {{are most}} {{commonly}} used to rapidly control acute mania and mixed episodes, often in conjunction with mood stabilizers (which {{tend to have a}} delayed onset of action in such cases) such as lithium and valproate. In milder cases of mania or mixed episodes, mood stabilizer monotherapy may be attempted first. SGAs are also used to treat other aspects of the disorder (such as acute <b>bipolar</b> depression or as a prophylactic treatment) as adjuncts or as a monotherapy, depending on the drug. Both quetiapine and olanzapine have demonstrated significant efficacy in all three treatment phases of <b>bipolar</b> disorder. Lurasidone (trade name Latuda) has demonstrated some efficacy in the acute depressive phase of <b>bipolar</b> disorder.|$|E
25|$|In <b>bipolar</b> disorder, {{mixed state}} is a {{condition}} during which symptoms of both mania and depression occur simultaneously. Individuals experiencing a mixed state may have manic symptoms such as grandiose thoughts while simultaneously experiencing depressive symptoms such as excessive guilt or feeling suicidal. Mixed states {{are considered to be}} high-risk for suicidal behavior since depressive emotions such as hopelessness are often paired with mood swings or difficulties with impulse control. Anxiety disorders occur more frequently as a comorbidity in mixed <b>bipolar</b> episodes than in non-mixed <b>bipolar</b> depression or mania. Substance abuse (including alcohol) also follows this trend, thereby appearing to depict <b>bipolar</b> symptoms as no more than a consequence of substance abuse.|$|E
25|$|Tamoxifen {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} in the treatment of mania in patients with <b>bipolar</b> disorder by blocking protein kinase C (PKC), an enzyme that regulates neuron activity in the brain. Researchers believe PKC is over-active during the mania in <b>bipolar</b> patients.|$|E
25|$|Going {{in another}} direction, {{numerous}} links and overlaps {{have been found}} between major depressive disorder and <b>bipolar</b> syndromes, including mixed states (simultaneous depression and mania or hypomania). Hypomanic ('below manic') and more rarely manic signs and symptoms {{have been found in}} a significant number of cases of major depressive disorder, suggesting not a categorical distinction but a dimension of frequency which is higher in <b>bipolar</b> II and higher again in <b>bipolar</b> I. In addition, numerous subtypes of <b>bipolar</b> have been proposed beyond the types already in the DSM (which includes a milder form called cyclothymia). These extra subgroups have been defined in terms of more detailed gradations of mood severity, or the rapidity of cycling, or the extent or nature of psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, due to shared characteristics between some types of <b>Bipolar</b> disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, some researchers have suggested they may both lie on a spectrum of affective disorders, although others see more links to post-trauma syndromes.|$|E
25|$|Venlafaxine {{is neither}} {{recommended}} nor approved {{for the treatment}} of major depressive episodes in <b>bipolar</b> disorder as it can induce mania or mixed episodes. Venlafaxine appears to be more likely than the SSRIs and bupropion to induce mania and mixed episodes in <b>bipolar</b> patients.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} on {{the effectiveness}} of ECT in unipolar and <b>bipolar</b> depression was conducted in 2012. Results indicated that although patients with unipolar depression and <b>bipolar</b> depression responded to other medical treatments very differently, both groups responded equally well to ECT. Overall remission rate for patients given a round of ECT treatment was 51.5% for those with unipolar depression and 50.9% for those with <b>bipolar</b> depression. The severity of each patient’s depression was assessed at the same baseline in each group.|$|E
25|$|Associated {{features}} are clinical phenomena that often accompany the disorder {{but are not}} part of the diagnostic criteria. In adults with the condition, <b>bipolar</b> disorder is often accompanied by changes in cognitive processes and abilities. These include reduced attentional and executive capabilities and impaired memory. How the individual processes the universe also depends on the phase of the disorder, with differential characteristics between the manic, hypomanic and depressive states. Some studies have found a significant association between <b>bipolar</b> disorder and creativity. Those with <b>bipolar</b> disorder may have difficulty in maintaining relationships. There are several common childhood precursors seen in children who later receive a diagnosis of <b>bipolar</b> disorder; these disorders include mood abnormalities, full major depressive episodes, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).|$|E

25|$|Various {{methods of}} {{manufacturing}} <b>bipolar</b> transistors were developed.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 review about {{lamotrigine}} {{concluded that}} it is recommended in <b>bipolar</b> maintenance when depression is prominent and that {{more research is needed}} in regards to its role in the treatment of acute <b>bipolar</b> depression and unipolar depression. Furthermore, no information to recommend its use in other psychiatric disorders was found.|$|E
25|$|A <b>bipolar</b> {{junction}} transistor (<b>bipolar</b> transistor or BJT) {{is a type}} of transistor that uses both electron and hole charge carriers. In contrast, unipolar transistors, such as field-effect transistors, only use one kind of charge carrier. For their operation, BJTs use two junctions between two semiconductor types, n-type and p-type.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Drs. Linda C. Schaffer, Charles B. Schaffer, and J. Caretto {{conducted}} a follow-up study on those earlier reports, {{as no one}} else had done so in the six years following their publication, and found it to be roughly as (permanently) effective for refractory <b>bipolar</b> disorder as Hayes had reported it to be (31% vs. Hayes's 33%). All subjects with a permanent and complete treatment response were either <b>Bipolar</b> I or <b>Bipolar</b> NOS. In this study, unlike the 1993 case report, primidone affected manic symptomsespecially insomnia, anxiety, and racing thoughtsand only on manic symptoms.|$|E
