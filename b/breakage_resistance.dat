40|$|International audienceThe shear {{strength}} of coarse granular materials, {{widely used in}} civil works such as rockfill in dam construction, is seldom measured because of severe practical experimental limitations. This paper presents an original method for evaluating the {{shear strength}} of such materials, based on size effects in granular materials affected by grain breakage according to fracture mechanics. Through a general size effect relation operating on shear strength envelopes, this method {{makes it possible to}} determine the shear strength of a coarse-grained granular material from the measured properties of a finer-grained granular material made of the same mineral. In the paper, the method is explicitly proved, taking into account the statistical distribution of <b>breakage</b> <b>resistances</b> of particles with different sizes, within materials that can be considered as physically similar, particularly having parallel grain size distributions and the same compactness.

40|$|In {{full scale}} water {{treatment}} operation, the rapid filtration process, {{as the last}} step of solid liquid separation, is largely influenced by floc characteristics. In this study, aluminium sulphate (alum) and nano-Al- 13 were investigated to understand the influence of coagulant species on the formation and filterability of flocs. At neutral pH, {{it was found that}} nano-Al- 13, a high MW polymer, showed better floc filterability than alum. This is because of the densely compacted and well-distributed size flocs from nano-Al- 13, even though floc sizes of alum were generally bigger. Al specie distributions of the two coagulants at different pH levels were compared by using electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS) to further elucidate the reasons for the superiority of nano-Al- 13 in floc filterability. Depolymerisation/re-polymerisation of nano-Al- 13 occurred as pH changed, and Al species from nano-Al- 13 were more abundant than that from alum, especially for the high molecular weight (MW) oligomers such as Al- 11, Al- 12, Al- 13 and Al- 14. Under the charge neutralisation mechanism, higher MW Al species was found to improve coagulation performance and floc filterability. In addition, <b>breakage</b> <b>resistance</b> and regrowth ability of nano-Al- 13 was better than alum, at weak acid condition. Flocs formed by the charge neutralisation mechanism readily regenerated after being thoroughly broken up. The floc regrowth ability of nano-Al 13 at high shear rates (200 rpm and 300 rpm) was much better than at low shear and better than any shear applied to alum., and the flocs after breakage at 200 rpm and 300 rpm also showed better filterability than other conditions.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to investigate the utilization of dietary calcium and phosphorus from two kinds of wheat bran in lacto-ovo-vegetarian, vegan, and omnivore diets by lacto-ovo-vegetarians and omnivores. Normal urinary calcium and phosphorus response to intake of calcium and phosphorus was evaluated using 24 -hour composites. Results suggested lacto-ovo-vegetarians showed better ability to absorb calcium and phosphorus from lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets with or without bran supplements than did omnivores. However, lacto-ovo-vegetarians fed bran supplemented diets tended to increase their urinary calcium excretion {{to a greater extent}} than did the omnivore group. It was postulated that this hypercalciuria might have been due to the increased ability of the lacto-ovo-vegetarians to absorb phosphorus. ^ The effect of variations in calcium and phosphorus intake levels fed with either animal or plant proteins on bone breaking strength and calcium and phosphorus utilization of weanling mice was investigated. Sixty-four weanling mice were fed either 0. 3 % calcium and 0. 3 % phosphorus or 1. 2 % calcium and 1. 2 % phosphorus plus animal or plant protein for eight weeks. Mice fed animal protein diets had more resistance to bone breakage than did the plant protein fed mice. Feeding of animal proteins in comparison to plant diets apparently inhibited absorption of phosphorus. Feeding of low phosphorus diets also enhanced femur bone <b>breakage</b> <b>resistance</b> in comparison to feeding of high calcium diets which resulted in increased fecal phosphorus excretions and decreased urinary phosphorus excretion. ^ The attitudes of physicians and nurses as well as nutritional attributes of plant product oriented diets and general nutritional attitudes were surveyed in Imo, Nigeria.

40|$|Submerged {{plants in}} shallow lakes {{are subject to}} pulling forces arising from waves, {{currents}} and grazing birds. Such forces can cause anchorage failure (mainly dislodgement of the root system) or breaking failure of the stems. Both lead to loss of fitness but uprooting is more damaging because many perennial species can replace broken shoot systems. We investigated 12 abundant species (Ceratophyllum demersum, Chara sp., Eleogiton fluitans, Elodea canadensis, Myriophyllum spicatum, Najas marina, Potamogeton natans, P. obtusifolius, P. pectinatus, P. pusillus, Utricularia vulgaris and Zannichellia palustris) in 28 shallow lakes in the UK and the Netherlands. We measured the anchorage and breaking strengths of individual plants of different sizes. Anchorage strength depends on the cohesive strength of the sediment {{and the size of}} the root system. The undrained shear-strength of sediments in shallow lakes varied more than 50 -fold, but all were substantially weaker than terrestrial soils. Anchorage strength was modelled using the product of sediment cohesive strength and four measures of root-system size. A transformation of plan-form area (raising it to the power 2 / 3) that represented the hemispherical surface area of the root ball was consistently the best predictor of anchorage strength. Breaking strength was a linear function of stem cross-sectional area in all species. Breaking stresses were comparable with those of marine algae and non-lignified terrestrial plants. The results were used, in combination with plant allometric relationships, to predict the fates of four of the species when challenged with the largest waves likely to be encountered in a 10 -year period, and the even greater forces exerted by grazing birds. We show that sediment strength and plant size determine whether plants break or uproot. A careful balance between investment in anchorage and in <b>breakage</b> <b>resistance</b> is needed to survive in the fluctuating physical environment of lakes. Pulling forces experienced by aquatic plants are distinct from the mainly bending forces on more rigid land plants. We provide the first theoretical and quantitative framework for understanding their effects. Anchorage failure associated with the soft sediments of eutrophic lakes is likely to be a factor in the loss of macrophyte communities and an important factor in their restoration...|$|E

We report here the correction of both of these DEB-hypersensitivity phenotypes of FA cells achieved by cotransfection of normal placental or Chinese hamster lung cell DNA and the plasmid pSV 2 -neo-SVgpt. Transfectants were selected for clonogenic survival after treatment with DEB at a dose of 5 micrograms/ml. At this dose of DEB, the clonogenicity of normal fibroblasts was reduced to 50 % and that of FA fibroblasts was reduced to zero. DEB-resistant (DEBr) colonies selected in this system exhibited a normal response to DEB-induced chromosome <b>breakage</b> and <b>resistance</b> to repeated DEB treatment. The neo and gpt sequences were detected by Southern blot analysis of DNA from one of four DEBr colonies independently derived from transfection of human DNA and one of three DEBr colonies independently derived from transfection of Chinese hamster DNA.

The DEBr phenotype of these colonies was stably maintained over several subcultures.

The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the Magnaporthe oryzae pathotype diversity in new commercial irrigated rice fields in the Araguaia River Valley, state of Tocantins, Brazil. The causal agent of rice blast has heavily affected rice production in the region. Despite the efforts of breeding programs, blast resistance breakdown has been recorded shortly {{after the release of}} new resistant cultivars developed for the region. Among the causes of <b>resistance</b> <b>breakage</b> is the capacity of the fungus to rapidly develop new pathotypes. A sample of 479 M. oryzae monosporic isolates was obtained and tested using the international rice blast differential set. Isolate collections were made in small areas designed as trap nurseries and in scattered sites in their vicinity. Analysis of 250 M. oryzae isolates from three trap nurseries indicated the presence of 45 international M. oryzae races belonging to seven pathotype groups (IA-IG).

40|$|Although maize {{was early}} {{recognized}} as an excellent forage plant soon after its introduction in Europe, during a long time it was only bred for grain traits. Conversely to agronomic value, a steady decline in the average cell wall digestibility of hybrids was observed since the 1950 s, despite a greater specialization of hybrids between forage and grain uses, except for the Netherlands where varietal registration has taken into account traits related to plant digestibility for longer times. Modern hybrids had on average a 5. 5 % lower in vivo cell wall digestibility than the old ones, leading to an organic matter digestibility reduction by 2 %, despite a tendency to a slight, but significant, increase in grain content. When compared to the well-known early hybrid LG 11, hybrids with a lower cell wall digestibility were 32, 63, 75, 84, and 93 % {{in each of the}} registration periods before 1981, 1989, 1994, 1999, and in or after 1999, respectively. Alleles for highly friable and digestible cell walls were either eliminated during breeding for stalk standability and <b>breakage</b> <b>resistance,</b> or lost by genetic drift during breeding for grain yield. Breeding of highly digestible and ingestible forage maize may depend on the reevaluation and use of old genetic resources that are not currently used, and/or specific breeding of digestibility/ingestibility resource lines. Cell wall structure and organization, and lignified tissue patterning, are the key factor explaining silage maize variation both for cell wall digestibility and intake. In maize, as in other Poaceae, p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid, along with its array of dehydrodimers, are ester and/or ether-linked to the cell wall polymers. Linkages of pCA esters to syringyl lignin units may markedly influence not only the binding mode of these lignin units, but also the spatial organization of the polymers and their interactions with polysaccharides. Similarly, ferulates cross-linking between guaiacyl residues and arabinoxylans is detrimental to cell wall digestibility, acting as a reinforcement of the wall structure, and decreasing wall component accessibility to microorganism enzymes. Moreover, diferulate cross-linking of arabinoxylan chains is also involved in cell wall digestibility decrease, and is commonly thought {{to play a role in}} stiffening cell walls. While first improvements of maize cell wall digestibility were (will still be) based on whole plant digestibility tests, understanding the biochemical and molecular basis of cell wall biogenesis, organization, and lignification, is now required to realize further progress in plant cell wall digestibility and intake.

40|$|Two mussel species (Mytilus edulis and Mytilus trossulus) form {{a hybrid}} {{zone in the}} {{northwest}} Atlantic that is complex in its structure and dynamics. The study of Mytilus hybrid zones can reveal important aspects of marine evolution and speciation. A patchy distribution of M. edulis and M trossulus around Newfoundland suggests that differential adaptation to environmental conditions may be important in determining the species relative frequency and fitness. The observation that M. trossulus is less tolerant to warm temperatures than M. edulis implies that physiological differentiation may contribute to reproductive isolation since discrete biogeographic distributions help to maintain the genetic identity of the species. Differences in the microgeographic distribution of the species indicate that habitat specialization may also contribute to reproductive isolation. The presence of pure M. trossulus populations in five sites sampled in Labrador likely result in a great larval input from this species into the hybrid zone through the Labrador Current. Poorer adaptation to the environmental conditions of Newfoundland would then result in a higher mortality of M trossulus in the area. Evidence for differential survival was suggested by the observed decrease in the relative frequency of M. trossulus in the larger size classes at most sites in Newfoundland and by the greater mortality observed in field grow-out and temperature experiments. Differences in life-history strategies may also influence the observed frequency pattern since M. trossulus reproduces earlier, spawns smaller eggs and possibly has a shorter generation time than M. edulis. Gamete recognition and incompatibility are probably important isolating mechanisms between M. edulis and M. trossulus. Intrinsic postzygotic mortality likely represents an additional isolating mechanism. Reduced hybrid viability was observed mainly {{in the early stages}} of development, but higher mortality of hybrids also occurred at later stages. F 1 hybrids and advanced backcrosses were the groups that showed greatest variance in fitness, suggesting that although most hybrids have reduced fitness, some hybrid combinations may be as fit or even fitter than the parent species. The use of several DNA markers revealed that the distribution of Mytilus genotypes in the northwest Atlantic hybrid zone is strongly bimodal, showing that very few F I hybrids are present and that most hybrids are advanced backcrosses. Although low levels of introgression were observed, the presence of few backcross individuals that were homozygous for alleles from the opposite species suggests that introgression can be a potential mechanism for adaptive evolution in Mytilus. Despite the overall lower fitness of hybrids, some hybrid individuals can express hybrid vigour and may be important for the introgression of genes between the species. Other intrinsic differences were observed between the species such as settlement behaviour, growth, survival, shell morphology and shell <b>breakage</b> <b>resistance.</b> Such differences likely play a role in maintaining the coexistence of both species. Information on species differences together with the increased performance of some hybrids can be used to help improve aquaculture production. As in other hybrid zones, the Mytilus hybrid zone in the northwest Atlantic is probably maintained by a combination of several factors. Pre-zygotic mechanisms (habitat specialization, gamete recognition and incompatibility) as well as post- zygotic mechanisms (reduced hybrid fitness) are critical factors responsible for reproductive isolation that were identified in the present study...|$|E
40|$|Tese de mestrado, Medicamentos à Base de Plantas, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Farmácia, 2016 Today, {{consumers}} {{are looking for}} effective, safe and natural products that contribute to your health, wellness and beauty. As a result, the consumer created {{the need to develop}} new cosmetic products formulated with natural ingredients such as essential oils. These are complex mixtures of volatile, odoriferous and lipophilic secondary metabolites which are biosynthesized in specialized cells (secretory cells, epidermal cells, glandular trichomes), mainly present in aromatic plants. As natural ingredients, essential oils are a growing market trend for perfumery and cosmetic. In addition to the pleasant odor, they can also be important preservatives due to the strong antimicrobial activity. However, the essential oils are rather volatile and some of its constituents may cause skin sensitivity, for example, contact dermatitis and photoallergy. Thus, Annex III of Regulation No 1223 / 2009, provides a list of substances which cosmetic products must not contain out of the laid down restrictions. Preservatives are added to cosmetic products so that they have an extended shelf-life, preventing the development of microorganism that cause diseases to consumers or harm the appearance of the product. However, legislation concerning chemical preservatives has undergone changes and updates {{as a result of the}} knowledge of sensitivity and toxicity problems inherent to these products. This work aims at highlighting the potential of essential oils, with antimicrobial activity, isolated from native plants in Portugal: Thymus caespititius Brot., Thymbra capitata (L.) Cav., e Myrtus communis L., by including them in topical formulations, in order to assess their capacity as preservatives. The three essential oils, obtained from Th. caespititius, T. capitata and M. communis were isolated from the aerial parts of different flowering plants by hydrodistillation, analyzed by gas chromatography for components quantification and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, for components identification. All essential oils showed faint yellow colours. The isolated essential oils were complex mixtures, in which 64 constituents for Th. caespititius, 30 in T. capitata and 34 in M. communis were identified. Monoterpenes were the dominant class of compounds (76 %, 97 % and 91 %, respectively), whereas sesquiterpenes ranged between 2 and 16 %, and phenylpropanoids from traces to 3 %. α-Terpineol was the dominant compound Th. caespititius essential oil, while carvacrol dominated the T. capitata essential oil. 1, 8 -Cineole was the major compound present in the essential oil of M. communis. Based on chemical characterization of the three essential oils, including constituents considered as allergens (linalool, limonene, methyl eugenol, citronellol, geraniol and eugenol) present in Regulation 1223 / 2009, Annex III, two essential oils (Thymus caespititius and Thymbra capitata) out of three were chosen to be incorporated at 1 % as bioactive ingredients in topical formulations and the three essential oils (Thymus caespititius, Thymbra capitata and Myrtus communis) were chosen to be incorporated at 0. 5 % in topical formulation, to be assessed for physical-chemical parameters: pH, viscosity, phase separation and particle size. As healthy skin pH is of approximately 5, and topical application to healthy skin products presenting pH of 4 - 6, the pH values for the emulsions of essential oil were within limits. Concerning viscosity, the addition of essential oils greatly increases the <b>breakage</b> <b>resistance</b> of the structure when compared to placebo. These results were in accordance with the analysis of particle size, since the incorporation of essential oils either 1 or 0. 5 % decreases the particle size. All emulsions were stable. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the method of Kirby-Bauer and by the method of microdilution plate determining the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentrations for the three essential oils with or without dilution in DMSO and, for two controls: Dermosoft® OMP and benzyl alcohol. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 was extremely susceptible to the essential oil of T. capitata without dilution in DMSO; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 showed greater susceptibility to essential oils Th. caespititius and T. capitata and, lower susceptibility to M. communis essential oil diluted in DMSO (1 : 100). The essential oils of Th. caespititius and T. capitata were effective against fungi, showing better antifungal activity than Dermosoft® OMP for Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Three essential oils (Th. caespititius, T. capitata e M. communis) showed better activity against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria, and these results are in accordance with previous studies. All essential oils showed better results than the two controls. In summary, Th. caespititius, T. capitata and M. communis essential oils were effective against fungi, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Regarding the challenge test, emulsions with 1 % T. caespititius essential oil and T. capitata essential oil and emulsion with 0. 5 % M. communis essential oil are in accordance with the acceptance criteria A (2 Log 10 reduction) for the fungi (Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Aspergillus brasiliensis ATCC 16404) as well as the bacteria (ATCCC 9027 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538). Th. caespititius and T. capitata essential oils showed potential as alternative preservatives for use in topical formulations. Although the essential oil emulsion with M. communis is in accordance with criteria acceptance of the challenge test (FP 9), the percentage of allergen: methyl eugenol exceeds in percentage used (0. 5 % essential oil) the maximum concentration permitted by law (Regulation nº 1223 / 2009, Annex III). Hoje em dia, os consumidores procuram produtos eficazes, seguros e naturais que contribuam para a sua saúde, bem-estar e beleza. Como resultado, o consumidor criou a necessidade de desenvolver novos produtos cosméticos formulados com ingredientes naturais, tais como os óleos essenciais. Estes são misturas complexas de metabolitos secundários voláteis, lipófilos e odoríferos biosintetizados em estruturas especializadas (células secretoras, células epidérmicas, tricomas glandulares), presentes maioritariamente nas plantas aromáticas. Os óleos essenciais afirmam-se cada vez mais como uma tendência crescente no mercado da perfumaria e da cosmética. Para além de contribuírem com um odor agradável, podem também ser importantes agentes de conservação visto possuírem forte atividade antimicrobiana. Contudo, os óleos essenciais são bastante voláteis e de entre os vários constituintes de um óleo essencial, existem aqueles que produzem sensibilidade na pele provocando, por exemplo: dermatites de contacto e fotoalergia. Assim, o anexo III do Regulamento nº 1223 / 2009, apresenta uma lista de substâncias que os produtos cosméticos não podem conter fora das restrições previstas. Os conservantes são adicionados aos produtos cosméticos para que estes tenham um prazo de conservação alargado, prevenindo o desenvolvimento de microrganismos que causem doenças ao consumidor ou, prejudiquem a aparência do produto. No entanto, a legislação referente aos conservantes químicos tem vindo a sofrer alterações e atualizações em consequência do conhecimento de problemas de sensibilidade e toxicidade inerentes a estes produtos. Assim, este trabalho surge com o objetivo de valorizar os óleos essenciais com atividade antimicrobiana de plantas autóctones em Portugal: Thymus caespititius Brot., Thymbra capitata (L.) Cav., e Myrtus communis L., incluí-los em formulações tópicas, a fim de avaliar as suas capacidades como conservantes. Os três óleos essenciais (Th. caespititius, T. capitata, M. communis) foram isolados das partes aéreas floridas das diferentes plantas por hidrodestilação, analisados por cromatografia gasosa para a quantificação dos seus componentes, e por cromatografia gasosa acoplada a espectrometria de massa para a identificação dos compostos. Todos os óleos essenciais apresentaram uma coloração amarela, tendo sido identificados 64 constituintes em Th. caespititius, 30 em T. capitata e 34 em M. communis, sendo que, os monoterpenos foram a classe de compostos dominantes (76 %, 97 % e 91 %, respetivamente), enquanto os sesquiterpenos variaram entre 2 e 16 %, e os fenilpropanóides de vestigial a 3 %. Para o óleo essencial de Th. caespititius o componente dominante foi α-terpineol, enquanto o óleo essencial de T. capitata apresentou como componente dominante o carvacrol. Já 1, 8 -cineole foi o composto maioritário do óleo essencial de M. communis. Com base na caracterização química dos óleos essenciais em estudo, nomeadamente os constituintes referidos como alérgenos (linalool, limoneno, metil eugenol, citronelol, geraniol e eugenol) no Regulamento nº 1223 / 2009, anexo III, e com consequentes restrições na sua utilização, foram incorporados em emulsões óleo-em-água (O/A) na concentração de 1 %, dois dos óleos essenciais: Th. caespititius e T. capitata, e na concentração de 0, 5 % os três óleos essenciais (Th. caespititius, T. capitata e M. communis), realizando-se uma avaliação físico-química: pH, viscosidade, separação de fases e, tamanho da partícula. O pH de pele saudável apresenta valores próximos de 5, e os produtos de aplicação tópica para pele saudável apresentarem um pH compreendido entre 4 - 6 assim, os valores de pH de todas as emulsões com óleo essencial encontram-se dentro dos limites referidos. Relativamente à viscosidade, a inclusão dos óleos essenciais aumenta significativamente a resistência da estrutura quando comparado com o placebo. O que se confirma com a análise do tamanho da partícula, visto que, de um modo geral, a inclusão dos óleos essenciais quer a 1 %, quer a 0, 5 % diminui o tamanho das partículas. Todas as emulsões foram estáveis. Avaliou-se a atividade antimicrobiana pelo método de Kirby-Bauer e pelo método da microdiluição em placa, determinando-se a concentração mínima inibitória e a concentração mínima bactericida para os três óleos essenciais com e sem diluição em DMSO e, para dois controlos: Dermosoft® OMP e do álcool benzílico. Verificando-se que: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCCC 9027 foi extremamente suscetível ao óleo essencial de T. capitata sem diluição em DMSO; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 apresentou maior suscetibilidade aos óleos essenciais de Th. caespititius e T. capitata e, menor suscetibilidade ao óleo essencial de M. communis diluído em DMSO (1 : 100). Os óleos essenciais de Th. caespititius e T. capitata foram eficazes contra os fungos, revelando melhor atividade antifúngica que Dermosoft® OMP para Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Os três óleos essências (Th. caespititius, T. capitata e M. communis) apresentaram melhor atividade contra bactérias Gram-positivas do que bactérias Gram-negativas, estando estes resultados de acordo com estudos anteriormente realizados. Todos os óleos essenciais revelaram melhores resultados que os dois controlos. Sumariamente, os três óleos essenciais (Th. caespititius, T. capitata e M. communis) mostraram-se eficazes contra fungos, bactérias Gram-positivas e Gram-negativas. Quanto ao teste de eficácia dos conservantes as emulsões com 1 % de Th. caespititius e T. capitata e a emulsão com 0, 5 % de M. communis estão de acordo com o critério de aceitação A (redução de 2 Log 10) quer para os fungos (Candida albicans ATCC 10231 e Aspergillus brasiliensis ATCC 16404) quer para as bactérias (Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCCC 9027 e Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538). Os óleos essenciais de Th. caespititius e T. capitata revelaram-se potenciais conservantes alternativos para aplicação em formulações tópicas. Embora a emulsão com óleo essencial de M. communis cumpra com o critério de aceitação do teste de eficácia dos conservantes (FP 9), a percentagem do alérgeno metil eugenol, excede na percentagem utilizada (0, 5 % de óleo essencial) a máxima concentração permitida pela lei (Regulamento 1223 / 2009, anexo III) ...|$|E

Despite the efforts of breeding programs, blast resistance breakdown has been recorded shortly {{after the release of}} new resistant cultivars developed for the region. Among the causes of <b>resistance</b> <b>breakage</b> is the capacity of the fungus to rapidly develop new pathotypes. A sample of 479 M. oryzae monosporic isolates was obtained and tested using the international rice blast differential set. Isolate collections were made in small areas designed as trap nurseries and in scattered sites in their vicinity. Analysis of 250 M. oryzae isolates from three trap nurseries indicated the presence of 45 international M. oryzae races belonging to seven pathotype groups (IA-IG). In the isolates tested, 61 M. oryzae pathotypes belonging to all but the IH group were detected. The new areas of irrigated rice in the Araguaia River Valley have the highest diversity of M. oryzae pathotypes reported so far in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|Current {{crop and}} {{livestock}} farming strategies based on elite varieties and breeds and intensive {{use of chemicals}} (pesticides, medicines) suffer from major limitations. Production losses, alteration of natural resources, loss of biodiversity, risk to human health, and vulnerability of the agrosystems dependent on polluted resources {{are part of the}} numerous undesirable side effects. The solutions derived from the paradigm of eradication of pathogens have shown their limits. The considerable variability and adaptability among pathogen strains results in emerging resistance and replacement of susceptible with resistant strains in many pathogen species. When extremely aggressive emergent pests or <b>resistance</b> <b>breakage</b> occur, no more food production is possible. Novel approaches and methods are needed to encourage diseases management. The development of an ecological engineering approach that combines nested multi-scale levers is necessary. Mobilizing ecological interactions, largely unexplored, is a key issue to design new health management options. Thus, it fits in with the “smart” (FAO 2011) approach required for the agroecological transition. We analyze how to enhance ecological interactions for crop and animal health. Based on a conceptual grid (Chave, 2015; Chave and Angeon, 2014), we show that consistent strategies for mobilizing ecological interactions rely on a complex activation of key levers at different spatial scales. We apply this analytical grid to two case studies relating to plant and animal health in the French West Indies. These areas face strong challenging diseases for which most of the conventional solutions requiring the use of chemicals barely function. By applying an analytical grid that constitutes the ABCs of ecological regulation to crop and livestock health, we point out strategic choices lead in the French West Indies to cope with diseases. We show how new multi-scale approaches are implemented to identify solutions to enhance ecological interactions for crop and livestock health...|$|R
40|$|Recurrent {{selection}} for three cycles, based on S(, 1) lines, {{was completed in}} separate programs in the maize (Zea mays L.) variety, Iowa Synthetic # 1 (BS 1), for resistance to mechanical stalk <b>breakage</b> and <b>resistance</b> to stalk rot after inoculation with Diplodia maydis. Improvements in stalk quality and correlated responses in yield and several agronomic ear and plant traits were evaluated. The materials {{used for this study}} included the original (BS 1 C 0) and the improved population of each cycle (BS 1 MS and BS 1 SR populations for stalk-strength and stalk-rot selection, respectively), population crosses between each method of selection, crosses of each population with a poor stalk quality single cross, the original (C 0) and final (C 3) populations selfed once, C 0 x C 3, and random S 1 lines from the C 0 and each C 3;Highly significant improvements were observed for all stalk-quality traits. Changes from the C 0 to BS 1 MSC 3 and BS 1 SRC 3, respectively, were as follows: resistance to mechanical stalk breakage, 34. 8 to 56. 5 and 46. 7 kg; artificial stalk-rot rating, 3. 5 to 1. 8 and 1. 7; rind strength, 3. 4 to 4. 2 and 4. 3 kg; field stalk-rotted plants, 25. 4 to 5. 0 and 7. 6 %; and field stalk-lodged plants, 13. 3 to 6. 0 and 2. 5 %. Observed values for the population crosses, testcrosses of the populations, and S(, 1) lines indicated that the stalk-quality traits were controlled primarily by additive gene action;Grain yield was reduced from 70. 8 q/ha in the C 0 to 49. 5 and 54. 2 q/ha in the BS 1 MSC 3 and BS 1 SRC 3 populations, respectively. The yield reductions were caused by reductions in all yield components except kernel weight, which showed increases for both selection methods. Divergent responses were observed in maturity and plant traits because the BS 1 MS populations showed increases and the BS 1 SR populations showed decreases for most traits. No significant associations were observed between stalk quality and resistance to northern leaf blight and European corn borer. All correlated responses in agronomic traits were caused primarily by allelic frequency changes for these traits during {{selection for}} improved stalk quality;A comprehensive breeding program that includes recurrent selection of S(, 1) lines by using an index of stalk-rot resistance, rind strength, yield, and maturity, with extraction of superior lines after each cycle of population improvement, was recommended. The gain will be less than for individual selection for stalk rot or stalk strength, but the improved population should allow extraction of more lines with good stalk quality and desirable agronomic performance...|$|R
