Only two governors, William Allen Egan and Bill Walker, were born in Alaska. Two people, Egan and Wally Hickel, have <b>been</b> <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> multiple non-consecutive terms as governor.

5|$|Factionalism again {{marked the}} Republican nominating {{convention}} in 1904. Bradley and his faction backed Augustus E. Willson for governor, while Hunter and Yerkes favored Louisville businessman Morris B. Belknap, the son-in-law of former governor Simon Buckner. When convention officials ruled against a county delegation committed to Willson, he {{withdrew from the}} contest. Bradley was angered as Belknap was nominated on the first ballot and subsequently lost to J. C. W. Beckham, who was allowed to seek a second term because a court ruled he had not <b>been</b> <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> a full term in 1900.|$|E

5|$|Having just <b>been</b> <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> the Senate with Sherman's support, Garfield {{entered the}} 1880 {{campaign}} season committed to Sherman as his {{choice for the}} Republican presidential nominee. Even before the convention began, however, a few Republicans, including Wharton Barker of Philadelphia, thought Garfield {{the best choice for}} the nomination. Garfield denied any interest in the position, but the attention was enough to make Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant's ambitions. Besides Sherman, the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine and former president Grant, but several other candidates attracted delegates as well.|$|E

5|$|The Ineligibility Clause has {{interfered}} with appointments {{as far back}} as 1793. President George Washington attempted to appoint William Paterson to the Supreme Court on February 27, 1793, after the resignation of Associate Justice Thomas Johnson. However, Paterson, who was serving as Governor of New Jersey, had previously <b>been</b> <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> serve a Senate term that would expire at noon on March 4, 1793.

5|$|The {{election}} of 1796 {{was the first}} contested American presidential election. Twice, George Washington had <b>been</b> <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> office unanimously; however, during his presidency, deep philosophical {{differences between the two}} leading figures in the administration – Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson – regarding domestic economic policy and U.S. foreign policy caused a rift between them, and led to the founding of the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party. Thus, when Washington announced {{that he would not be}} a candidate for a third term, an intense partisan struggle for control of Congress and the presidency began.|$|E
5|$|Three {{members of}} the Sounds have <b>been</b> <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> the National Baseball Hall of Fame.
