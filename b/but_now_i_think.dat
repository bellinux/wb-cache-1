25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
500|$|Writing for AOL TV, Michael Sciannamea thought [...] "The Convict" [...] seemed {{different}} from previous episodes, citing as evidence {{the scene of}} Michael and Martin discussing trustworthy black men; Sciannamea attributed this to its guest writers: [...] "I don't think Gervais and Merchant went over the top...it just seemed {{a little different than}} the others." [...] Also in his review, Sciannamea expressed his gradual enjoyment of Andy, [...] "When I first saw him up in Stamford, I thought he was just the Connecticut version of Dwight. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he adds greatly to the mix and is definitely one who is going to stir things up in Scranton." [...] Give Me My Remote's Kath Skerry believed [...] "the uncomfortable, unbearably awkward moments that the UK version perfected are definitely present throughout the episode." [...] She also praised Helms for [...] "prov once again how perfectly he fits in on this show as he is absolutely hysterical." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pearson {{was offered}} a Germanics post at Kings College, Cambridge. Comparing Cambridge {{students}} to those he knew from Germany, Karl found German students inathletic and weak. He wrote his mother, [...] "I used to think athletics and sport was overestimated at Cambridge, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it cannot be too highly valued." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Five {{years ago}} I {{would have died}} over a {{controversy}} like this. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> just <b>think</b> it's foolish of them to take it so seriously." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Violet Hamilton, {{with an air}} of reflection; [...] "I was {{not quite}} sure whether I would or not, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> almost <b>think</b> <b>I</b> will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No; they’re hardly distinguishable; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have a clue. I’m {{inclined}} to believe the case was shipped {{by a man named}} Osborne. His name’s in the vessel’s manifest, and he has been associated with her owner for a long time. I found that out when I was considering the salvage scheme.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Following the (then) record low of {{the arctic}} sea ice extend in 2007, Mark Serreze, the {{director}} of US National Snow and Ice Data Center, stated [...] "If you asked {{me a couple of}} years ago when the Arctic could lose all of its ice then I would have said 2100, or 2070 maybe. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that 2030 is a reasonable estimate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reuniting {{at their}} parents' {{suburban}} D.C. home, Marvin's brother Frankie discussed {{the events of}} his tenure at Vietnam, detailing experiences that sometimes left the two brothers consoling each other in tears. Then after Frankie explained witnessing violence and murder before he was to depart back to the states, he recalled Marvin sitting propped up in a bed {{with his hands in}} his face. Afterwards, Marvin told his brother, [...] "I didn't know how to fight before, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I do. I just have to do it my way. I'm not a painter. I'm not a poet. But I can do it with music." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{incident}} {{has been}} compared to the 2012 trial of Pussy Riot for hooliganism and incitement of religious hatred in Moscow after their protest at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. [...] A Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty article about the Moscow trial described the Stop the Church protest as [...] "seminal", contributing to early 1990s reforms granting Americans with HIV and AIDS federal protection from discrimination, a U.S. government office on AIDS policy, and millions of dollars for biomedical research. [...] "ACT UP activists now say the St. Patrick's protest changed the way many Americans viewed the Catholic Church. It was no longer untouchable, and its policies -- on everything from condoms and abortion to gay marriage and women priests -- were no longer sacrosanct." [...] Jim Hubbard, an ACT UP member and maker of the documentary [...] "United in Anger" [...] about ACT UP history, said [...] "I wasn't clear about what going inside the church would add at the time. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that the shock of going inside and confronting the cardinal really worked. [...] It helped bring ACT UP to mainstream attention. It brought the crisis to a point where the government and the mainstream media really had to start dealing with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did," [...] said Kit, with a smile. [...] "I saw Miss Brown {{and asked}} her to marry me. She would not, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> can <b>think</b> about it calmly, I see she took a very proper line." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he good bow, dat--might kill hummin'-bird wid dat bow. Fish good here, eh?" [...] "They are eatable, when a {{body can}} get no better. <b>But</b> <b>NOW,</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think,</b> Pigeonswing, you might {{give us some}} of the news." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, see ye here," [...] {{continued}} Dick, [...] "an we but escape whole we'll marry; and an we're to die, we die, and there's an end on't. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> that <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> how found ye my chamber?" ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. I hope so. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I must bolt. I {{have a long}} Chinese {{document}} to translate. [Holding {{out his hand to}} DAISY.] I hope you'll both be very happy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I say again, {{ask that}} of herself, Bladud; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it," [...] added the princess, leaping up in haste, [...] "I am almost {{too late to}} keep an {{appointment}} with Dromas!" ...|$|E
60|$|Wood. I have no {{adventures of}} my own, can deserve your curiosity; <b>but,</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> on it, I {{can tell you}} one that {{happened}} to a French cavalier, a friend of mine, at Tripoli.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{the first}} time I ever knew you to betray any caution, my dear boy, and you should be commended for it; <b>but</b> just <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is thrown away, for I hardly believe there is any one within half a mile of us who is awake so early." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{would like}} to know is if Aunt Olivia is going to be married," [...] said the Story Girl absently. [...] "I can hardly believe it. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it--Uncle Roger has been teasing her ever since she was in Halifax last summer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{they will}} come, and when least expected--frequently in church, {{but also in}} the sunshine; and when I am riding too, when, once, every thing seemed gay. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> often <b>think</b> of strife, and struggle, and war--civil war: the stir of our cavalcade seems like the tramp of cavalry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was very}} kind {{while we were}} in Normandy. I loved him so much better than the Count de Harcourt; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that the Count is best! I'll tell you, Osmond, I will never call him grim old Bernard again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes," [...] said Father Tiebout, [...] "one {{grows out}} of it, {{and that is a}} little different. Our friend yonder once went home, too, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he will stay here altogether, as I shall do, unless I am sent elsewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Humph!' said Mr Swiveller pondering, 'this is queer. Nothing but mysteries in {{connection}} with Brass's house. I'll keep my own counsel, however. Everybody and anybody has been in my confidence as yet, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'll set up in business for myself. Queer--very queer!' ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{last the}} little mice went off also, {{and the tree}} said, sighing: 'Really it was very {{pleasant}} when the lively little mice sat round and listened whilst I told them stories. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> that's over too. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> will <b>think</b> {{of the time when}} I shall be brought out again, to keep up my spirits.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{straight}} hair {{is all the}} fashion <b>now,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it gives a terrible dowdy look. Only that does not signify when you are not out.--By-the-bye, Miss Merton, are you out?' ...|$|R
6000|$|I feel very, {{very much}} obliged by your approbation; but, at this moment, praise, even your praise, passes by me like [...] "the idle wind." [...] I meant and mean {{to send you}} a copy the moment of publication; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> can <b>think</b> of nothing but damned, deceitful,--delightful woman, as Mr. Liston says in the 'Knight of Snowdon' [2]? Believe me, my dear Moore, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Miss Thorne; Mary, I mean--never mind me--I shall {{do it in}} time. Yes, she was; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it, I {{had better}} say nothing more about it. There are reasons, and I ought not to have spoken of it. You won't be {{provoked}} with me, will you?" ...|$|E
60|$|Now, therefore, I {{realize that}} there's no more beneficent {{institution}} than this penny fund of yours, and I {{want all the}} poets to know this. I did think about writing you a check, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'll send you a few copies of what one of your little members called 'Strawberry Finn'.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Surely, for {{who would}} harm thee? But we two--I and the child--shall be elsewhere, and we cannot come to thee, nor canst thou come to us. In the old days, before {{the child was}} born, I {{did not think of}} these things; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of them always. It is very hard talk.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gracious {{knows who}} {{it belongs to}} <b>now.</b> <b>But,</b> laws;--when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of all that he said, it's quite dreadful. One can't believe a word {{that comes out of}} his mouth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing at present," [...] Mr. Dunster replied. [...] "My head aches <b>now,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> shall want {{to leave}} before three days are up. Are you the doctor in the neighbourhood?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Years {{later in}} a career {{interview}} Lester said [...] "I really won't talk about The Return of the Musketeers...I never have and <b>I</b> won't <b>now.</b> <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you can draw your own conclusions." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sometimes {{with one}} I love I fill myself with rage for fear I effuse [...] unreturn'd love, [...] <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{there is no}} unreturn'd love, the pay is certain one [...] way or another, [...] (I loved a certain person ardently and my love was not return'd, [...] Yet out of that I have written these songs.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} clerk. [...] "Nobody {{just like that}} had the {{register}} while I've been about; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it, a man who might meet the bill stood by while another looked at the last page." [...] Then he indicated a figure near the revolving door, [...] "There! that's who he was with!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I am {{jealous of}} this stranger. What is he but a {{short-lived}} half-barbarian {{such as we}} knew in the old days? And yet already you think more of him than you do of me, your father, the divine Oro who has lived a thousand years. At first I helped that physician to save him, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I wish him dead.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> must, {{because it}} is true. If I do not tell her the truth, who is there that will do so? It may be bitter <b>now,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that it is for her welfare." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Brandon," [...] {{she said}} hesitatingly, [...] "I resented your {{trying to prevent}} Mr. Fuller coming here, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>think</b> it better that he should keep away. He's young and extravagant, and perhaps----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Winston quietly, [...] "I {{have only}} my word to offer, and I {{wonder if you}} will believe me <b>now,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> ever won five dollars at cards in my life." ...|$|R
