5|$|By April 1993, the Department of Veterans Affairs had {{compensated}} only 486 victims, {{although it}} had received disability claims from 39,419 soldiers who had <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Military {{personnel}} {{who were involved}} in storage, mixture and transportation (including aircraft mechanics), and actual use of the chemicals were probably among those who received the heaviest exposures. Military members who served on Okinawa also claim to have <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the chemical but there is no verifiable evidence to corroborate these claims.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{was again}} ordered into active duty {{to play a}} {{supporting}} role in the Gulf War in 1990. It officially switched to active service on 6 December 1990 at Brooklyn, New York. It participated in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm and earned two campaign streamers {{for participation in the}} conflict. On 11 March 1991 it was released from active military service and reverted to reserve status. The next day, while still in the country, the brigade was one of numerous units thought to have <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> chemical agents released during the Khamisiyah Pit demolition. Much of the NATO invasion force in the country at the time is suspected to have <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> these agents.|$|E
2500|$|With medical attention, {{radiation}} exposure is survivable to a 200 rems acute dose exposure. If {{a group of}} people <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> a 50 to 59 rems acute (within 24 hours) radiation dose, none will get radiation sickness. If the group <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 60 to 180 rems, 50% will become sick with radiation poisoning. If medically treated, all of the 60–180 rems group will survive. If the group <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 200 to 450 rems, most if not all of the group will become sick. 50% of the 200–450 rems group will die within two to four weeks, even with medical attention. If the group <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 460 to 600 rems, 100% of the group will get radiation poisoning. 50% of the 460–600 rems group will die within one to three weeks. If the group <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 600 to 1000 rems, 50% will die in one to three weeks. If the group <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 1,000 to 5,000 rems, 100% of the group will die within 2 weeks. At 5,000 rems, 100% of the group will die within 2 days[...]|$|R
5000|$|According to a study, many {{commercial}} sex workers, {{both men and}} women, <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> sexual and physical violence. 71.4% of street workers <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> violence/physical danger and almost 90% <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> sexual violence. On top of this, 73.5% of victims were physically abused in their childhood, showing the origins of such mental and physical effects of prostitution.|$|R
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that over 22 million workers <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> dangerous noise levels, and 10 million <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> solvents that could potentially cause hearing loss every year, with an unknown number <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> other ototoxic chemicals.|$|R

5|$|Youngs's {{career was}} {{abruptly}} cut short in 1926, {{when he was}} diagnosed with the kidney disorder that, at the time, was called Bright's disease. He had <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> streptococcal infection in 1924. Too ill to play after August 10, 1926, Youngs returned home on McGraw's insistence and received a blood transfusion in March 1927.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving to}} the US, Rihanna signed a {{contract}} with Def Jam Recordings, and released her debut album Music of the Sun (2005). The album was inspired by caribbean music, including soca, dancehall, and reggae, and incorporates dance-pop and R. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna said that when she had arrived in the US, she had <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> different types of music that she had never heard before, including rock music, which she incorporated into her second studio album, A Girl like Me (2006).|$|E
50|$|Testosterone {{levels in}} males {{have been shown}} to vary {{according}} to the ovulating state of females. Males who <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> scents of ovulating women recorded a higher testosterone level than males who <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> scents of nonovulating women. <b>Being</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> female ovulating cues may increase testosterone, which in turn may increase males' motivation to engage in, and initiate, sexual behaviour. Ultimately, these higher levels of testosterone may increase the reproductive success of males <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> female ovulation cues.|$|R
50|$|All {{entities}} <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> {{some form}} of market risk. For example, gold mines <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the price of gold, airlines {{to the price of}} jet fuel, borrowers to interest rates, and importers and exporters to exchangerate risks.|$|R
50|$|Three {{tests were}} {{conducted}} using penile plethysmography.

5|$|Aside {{from stable}} lutetium, its {{radioactive}} isotopes have several specific uses. The suitable half-life and decay mode made lutetium-176 {{used as a}} pure beta emitter, using lutetium which has <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> neutron activation, and in lutetium–hafnium dating to date meteorites. The synthetic isotope lutetium-177 bound to octreotate (a somatostatin analogue), is used experimentally in targeted radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors. Indeed, lutetium-177 is seeing increasing use as a radionuclide, in neuroendrocine tumor therapy and bone pain palliation.|$|E
5|$|During Pointman I, {{commission}} researchers devised ways {{to determine}} small dioxin levels in blood. Prior to this, such levels {{could only be}} found in the adipose (fat) tissue. The project studied dioxin (TCDD) levels in blood as well as in adipose tissue in a small group of Vietnam veterans who had <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> Agent Orange and compared them to those of a matched control group; the levels were found to be higher in the former group.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{lead exposure}} {{is associated with}} high blood pressure, and studies have also found connections between lead exposure and coronary heart disease, heart rate variability, and death from stroke, but this evidence is more limited. People who have <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> higher concentrations of lead may be at a higher risk for cardiac autonomic dysfunction on days when ozone and fine particles are higher.|$|E
50|$|Sixty-two {{percent of}} the {{children}} in hazardous labor were working in the agriculture sector, 30.1 percent were in the services sector, and the rest (7.6%) worked in the industry sector. Among the boys, 67.9 percent were in agriculture; while among the girls, 51.2 percent. For every five children in hazardous labor, two <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> physical hazards only (39.9%) and one <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> both chemical and physical hazards (Table 7). The rest <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> other types of hazards.|$|R
40|$|To {{prove the}} utility of antibiotic-removal beads in {{separating}} antibiotics from bacterial samples, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> five separate quinolones before and after each <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> antibiotic-removal beads. Plates treated with antibiotic solutions that <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> beads demonstrated antibiotic removal, and plates treated with antibiotic solutions that <b>were</b> not <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> beads demonstrated antibiotic carryover. After exposure to beads, fluoroquinolone concentrations decreased from 5 micrograms/ml to 0. 14 micrograms/ml (ciprofloxacin), 0. 04 micrograms/ml (temafloxacin), < 0. 01 microgram/ml (ofloxacin), < 0. 01 microgram/ml (sparfloxacin), and 0. 02 micrograms/ml (clinafloxacin). These data indicate that antibiotic carryover can be successfully circumvented {{through the use of}} antibiotic-removal beads...|$|R
5000|$|The {{participants}} in this experiment were 36 boys and 36 girls from the Stanford University nursery school, all {{between the ages of}} 37 months and 69 months {{with a mean age of}} 52 months (here and following, [...] ). The children were organized into 4 groups and a control group. The 4 groups <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the aggressive model and non-aggressive model belonged to the experimental group. 24 children <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> an aggressive model and 24 children <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> a non-aggressive model. The two groups were then divided into males and females, which ensured that half of the children <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> models of their own sex and the other half <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> models of the opposite sex. The remaining 24 children were part of a control group.|$|R
5|$|However, stool {{cultures}} {{should be}} performed in those with blood in the stool, those who might have <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> food poisoning, {{and those who have}} recently traveled to the developing world. It may also be appropriate in children young than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function. Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance. As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended. Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.|$|E
5|$|In a {{situation}} analogous {{with that of}} other European countries, the progressive internal decay of the Polish Church created conditions favorable for the dissemination of the Reformation ideas and currents. For example, there was a chasm between the lower clergy and the nobility-based Church hierarchy, which was quite laicized and preoccupied with temporal issues, such as power and wealth, and often corrupt. The middle nobility, which had already <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the Hussite reformist persuasion, increasingly looked at the Church's many privileges with envy and hostility.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to obvious dangers such as rodenticides, insecticides, and herbicides, cats may be poisoned by many chemicals usually considered safe by their human guardians, because their livers are less effective at {{some forms of}} detoxification than those of many other animals, including humans and dogs. Some {{of the most common}} causes of poisoning in cats are antifreeze and rodent baits. Cats may be particularly sensitive to environmental pollutants. When a cat has a sudden or prolonged serious illness without any obvious cause, it has possibly <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> a toxin.|$|E

5|$|James was a known philanderer {{who kept}} many mistresses, for which Anne often reproached him, once even {{complaining}} to the king, who sent one of James' mistresses to the countryside, where she remained until her death. Nonetheless, James fathered many illegitimate children. Years after Anne had herself converted, James avowed his Catholicism, {{which was a}} contributing factor to the Glorious Revolution. This was through Anne's influence; she had <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> Catholicism during visits to the Netherlands and France and was strongly attracted thereto.

5|$|No Gun Ri villagers {{said that}} in later decades, two mass graves holding some victims' remains were disturbed, and bones were removed during a {{reforestation}} project, and by farming activity. In 2007, excavations at several places near the bridge turned up little.

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} death, the UK's Health Protection Agency (HPA) said tests had {{established}} that Litvinenko had {{significant amounts of}} the radionuclide polonium-210 (210Po) in his body. British and US government officials said the use of 210Po as a poison had never been documented before, and {{it was probably the}} first time anyone had been tested for the presence of 210Po in their body. The poison was in Litvinenko's cup of tea. Those who had contact with Litvinenko may also have <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> radiation.|$|E

50|$|A study {{conducted}} in 2000 used geographic census data and outdoor nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration data {{to examine the}} disparities of NO2 air pollution across the United States. The study found that there is disproportional disparities {{in terms of both}} race and socioeconomic groups. The people of color <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 4.6 ppb more than average NO2 concentrations than white people. Those who live in below poverty level <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 1.2 ppb more. Lower-income Caucasians <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> 3.4 ppb higher NO2 concentrations than the higher-income Caucasians. The study also reports disproportional disparities of NO2 concentration exposure by education level; those who without high school education are more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> higher concentrations. Association between NO2 exposure and cancer development has been found in many studies.|$|R
5|$|Volcanic Sicily in {{the central}} Mediterranean, off the Italian peninsula, has been colonised by the Greeks, then it was under the Romans, the Byzantines, the Ostrogoths, the Muslims, the Normans, the Hohenstaufen, the Angevins and the Aragonese, after whom it became a {{province}} of the Spanish Empire and then {{was part of the}} Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, before finally being absorbed into the Kingdom of Italy in 1860.

5|$|Due {{to their}} {{higher levels of}} {{androgen}} exposure, the female hyenas are significantly more muscular and aggressive than their male counterparts; social-wise, they are of higher rank than the males, being dominant or dominant and alpha, and the females who have <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> higher levels of androgen than average become higher-ranking than their female peers. Subordinate females lick the clitorises of higher-ranked females {{as a sign of}} submission and obedience, but females also lick each other's clitorises as a greeting or to strengthen social bonds; in contrast, while all males lick the clitorises of dominant females, the females will not lick the penises of males because males are considered to be of lowest rank.|$|E
