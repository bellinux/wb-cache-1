5000|$|If {{an island}} is {{added in the}} middle of the river, then any number of couples can cross using a two-person boat.

[...] If the jealous couples are replaced by missionaries and cannibals, the number of trips required does not change if crossings from <b>bank</b> <b>to</b> <b>bank</b> are not allowed; if they are however the number of trips decreases to 4n&minus;1, assuming that n is at least 3., p. 81.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} <b>banks</b> <b>information</b> policies in fostering the accumulation of financial knowledge. In Italy, <b>banks</b> belonging <b>to</b> the PattiChiari Consortium implement policies aimed at increasing transparency and procedural simplification, without offering services at lower cost with respect <b>to</b> other <b>banks.</b> We exploit this feature of the Italian banking system and show that these policies promote financial literacy. The increase in financial knowledge attributable <b>to</b> <b>banks</b> <b>information</b> policies significantly affects household financial assets. We use these policies as instruments to estimate the effect of financial literacy on financial assets, showing that it is significantly underestimated by OLS correlation...|$|R

50|$|More {{recently}} {{with the advancement}} in mobile technologies, many alternative modes of electronic funds transfers have emerged. These alternative modes are changing the way people make payments in that fewer and fewer people are using traditional <b>banking</b> methods <b>to</b> transfer money. Rather than transfer money from <b>bank</b> <b>to</b> <b>bank,</b> they are opting <b>to</b> transfer the funds directly to the other party via a mobile application. With fewer people using traditional banks, and fewer people transferring money from <b>bank</b> <b>to</b> <b>bank,</b> the volume of transactions going through Fedwire {{on a daily basis}} is also likely to decline. With this type of electronic funds transfers, corporations act much like the Fed by using their commercial bank accounts for processing and transferring payments between individuals. Many of these systems like PayPal, Venmo and Google Wallet are accessible on mobile devices and are much cheaper for consumers than a wire sent via the Fedwire system.|$|R
