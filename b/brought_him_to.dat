5|$|During the war, Watson {{and some}} friends {{produced}} a newsletter to send to baseball players serving in the military. The newsletter <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the attention of {{an editor at the}} Seattle Star (a now defunct daily newspaper) where Watson was hired to cover the Rainiers in 1944. It was while working at the Star that Watson contracted polio.|$|E

5|$|He {{assumed the}} worst in people and he brought out {{the worst in}} them... He clung {{to the idea of}} being 'tough'. He thought that was what had <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the edge of greatness. But that was what betrayed him. He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness.|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the most important and pivotal of his early compositions because his performance of the song at an April 15, 1972, live radio concert at Sigma Studios on WMMR in Philadelphia, and the subsequent airplay this live version received on the station, <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the attention of major record labels, including Columbia, with whom he would sign a recording contract in 1973.|$|E

5|$|Retired Lieutenant Colonel Zeke Josepho recounts {{a strange}} {{experience}} during the Persian Gulf War {{and how he}} claims it <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> God: as his squad was ambushed during the Battle of Al Busayyah and {{on the verge of}} defeat, four mysterious men showed up and defeated the enemy with astonishing ease. While Josepho thinks of them as guardian angels, they are revealed to be the almost-indestructible Super Soldiers. In the present, Josepho stands above the wreckage of a spacecraft in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{came to be}} {{appreciated}} as a popular poet during his lifetime, though he found earning {{a living as a}} writer difficult. He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts. His radio recordings for the BBC during the late 1940s <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the public's attention, and he was frequently used by the BBC as a populist voice of the literary scene.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} someone {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]]. A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> acknowledge the authority of the pope.|$|E

5|$|Born in Rome in 1783, Pistrucci studied {{briefly with}} other artists before {{striking}} {{out on his}} own at age 15. He became prominent as a cameo carver and was patronised by royalty. In 1815, he moved to Britain, where he would live for {{most of the rest of}} his life. His talent <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the attention of notables including William Wellesley-Pole, the Master of the Mint. Pole engaged Pistrucci to design new coinage, including the sovereign, which was first issued in 1817 to mixed reactions. Although Pole probably promised Pistrucci the post of Chief Engraver, the position could not be awarded as only a British subject could hold it. This slight became a long-term grievance for Pistrucci.|$|E
5|$|Born in Windlesham, Surrey in 1976, {{where he}} lived and moved to Sherborne. He first learned to sail aged four or five, while visiting his {{grandparents}} at Christchurch, Dorset, and later sailed in a Seafly dinghy with his father, Keith. His talent <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the notice of Jim Saltonstall, who coached him in the Royal Yachting Association youth squad. Simpson attended Pangbourne College, a mixed boarding school in Berkshire, which originated as a nautical college, coaching students in sailing, seamanship and navigation. He studied at University College London, gaining a degree in economics. In addition to sailing, he was a keen footballer.|$|E
5|$|Christy {{could have}} {{graduated}} in 1940, {{but could not}} then be a teaching assistant, and this would have left him jobless and without income. In 1941, Oppenheimer found him a post at the physics department at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). In May 1941, he married Dagmar von Lieven. They had two sons: Thomas Edward (Ted), born in 1944, and Peter Robert, born in 1946. IIT paid Christy $200 per month to teach 27 hours per week for 11 months per annum. To keep abreast of developments in physics, he attended seminars at the University of Chicago. This <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the attention of Eugene Wigner, who hired him for the same money that IIT was paying him as a full-time research assistant, commencing in January 1942.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{regularly}} overlooked for a {{place in}} the elite South Australian junior state squads, he continued to follow the rest of the squad to training sessions in order to learn alongside them. Harley's persistent attendance at training was rewarded when he was called up to the under–18s squad as a late injury replacement a week prior to the National AFL Championships. Playing at centre half-back, Harley's performance in defence earned him end-of-year All-Australian honours and <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the attention of AFL scouts.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 he {{debuted in}} film, {{but he only}} had modest success in the medium. He {{continued}} to perform in variety theatre in the inter-war years and, in 1932, starred in Helen!, his first straight theatre role. His appearance <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the attention of many influential directors, including Sydney Carroll, who signed him to appear on stage as Falstaff in Henry IV, Part 1 in 1935, a role that he later repeated in Laurence Olivier's 1944 film, Henry V. During the Second World War, Robey raised money for charities and promoted recruitment into the forces. By the 1950s, his health had deteriorated, and he entered into semi-retirement. He was knighted {{a few months before}} his death in 1954.|$|E
5|$|In the 2013/14 season, Prevc {{recorded}} his first individual World Cup win in Kulm. With a second {{place at the}} same venue, Prevc won the season's ski flying title since there were only two scheduled ski flying events in the season. He went on to win in Sapporo which <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the top of the World Cup overall standings {{for the first time in}} his career, where he remained for the next couple of events. At the end of the season, he finished 2nd in the overall rankings, after Kamil Stoch of Poland. Prevc also won the last world cup event of the season in Planica, accumulating three wins and eleven podiums in total which was his most successful season until then.|$|E

5|$|It was Daniel Craig's {{performance}} in Our Friends in the North that first <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{the attention of}} producer Barbara Broccoli, who later cast him {{in the role of}} secret agent James Bond in the long-running film series. Christopher Eccleston also later went on to achieve notoriety in a cult screen role when he appeared as the Ninth Doctor in the BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who in 2005. Since then various media articles have noted the coincidence of the future James Bond and Doctor Who leads having co-starred in the same production earlier in their careers.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{was born}} in Bagan Serai, Perak, to a Malaysian Chinese family. In his early years, he favoured {{basketball}}, however his mother soon banned him from the game due to the searing heat of the outdoor basketball court. Lee began to learn badminton {{at the age of}} 11, when his father, who liked to play the game, <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the badminton hall. Attracting the attention of a local coach, the coach asked Lee's father if he could take him as a student. After receiving his father's consent, the coach began to train Lee after school. Discovered by Misbun Sidek, he was drafted into the national squad when he was seventeen years old.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus {{travelled}} through Cappadocia, Galatia and Bithynia {{before arriving}} in Chalcedon. Here he was arrested, his guise revealed {{after he had}} sent requests for money. Men dispatched by Elagabalus apprehended Macrinus and <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Cappadocia. Diadumenian was also captured elsewhere while {{on his way to}} Parthia, and then killed by the centurion Cladius Pollio in Zeugma. French author Jean-Baptiste Crevier comments that Macrinus threw himself out of the carriage at Cappadocia when he received the news of the death of his son, breaking his shoulder doing so. Macrinus was executed in Archemais in Cappadocia after attempting to escape; Dio mentions that the centurion Marcianus Taurus was responsible for his execution. Thus, the reign of Macrinus as emperor of Rome ended after nearly fourteen months.|$|E
