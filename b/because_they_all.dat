5|$|All IQ {{tests show}} {{variation}} in scores {{even when the}} same person takes the same test over and over again. IQ scores also differ for a test-taker taking tests {{from more than one}} publisher at the same age. The various test publishers do not use uniform names or definitions for IQ score classifications. All these issues must be kept in mind when interpreting an individual's IQ scores, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> can result in different IQ classifications for the same person at different times.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Ayer wrote Language, Truth and Logic, {{in which}} he claimed that {{religious}} language is meaningless. He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true, like mathematical statements. In doing so, he rejected metaphysics, which considers {{the reality of a}} world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God– theistic, atheistic and agnostic– arguing that they are all equally meaningless <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} is thought by some foreign policy analysts {{to be the}} basis for President George W. Bush's axis of evil line in his 2002 State of the Union Address, in which he accused Iraq, Iran, and North Korea of being state sponsors of terrorism and of pursuing weapons of mass destruction. The Rumsfeld Commission grouped the three countries together <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> were believed to be pursuing ballistic missile programs based on the Scud missile. In the pre-9/11 days of the Bush presidency, the administration had focused heavily on developing a national missile defense system to counter such threats. A month after the address, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who appointed Rumsfeld as head of the commission, mentioned the importance of the commission's findings in relation to the US ability to predict the threat posed by the axis members.|$|E

5|$|Kutzer {{points out}} Timmy {{and his wife}} wear clothes, but the other {{squirrels}} and the bear do not. There is no apparent reason for this differentiation. She admits {{that this may be}} Potter's attempt to separate her anthropomorphized animals from her natural ones, but she believes the attempt fails on both narrative and artistic grounds. Logically, she argues, all the squirrels should wear (or not wear) clothes <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> live and behave in a natural manner: Timmy and Goody inhabit a nest in a tree (not a comfortable little house somewhere), and all the squirrels gather nuts for the coming winter. Except for Timmy having a wife, there is no clear distinction between natural and personified squirrel nature. In another stumbling block to logic, Timmy's red jacket appears then disappears then reappears in the illustrations with no basis either in the plot or Timmy's character, but apparently in Potter's personal need for a splash of colour here and there. In this case, Potter has allowed an external force to shape the tale rather than letting the tale find its own shape.|$|E

25|$|The Arzap drogue {{stones are}} a number of large {{standing}} stones found near the Durupınar site by amateur archaeologist Ron Wyatt with the aid of David Fasold and others. Fasold interpreted the artifacts as drogues, stone weights used to stabilize the Ark in rough seas, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> have a chamfered hole cut at one end as if to fasten a rope to them, and his reading of the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Babylonian mythical account of the flood, suggested to him that such stones were used.|$|E
25|$|According to Eichler and Sankoff the two mean {{processes}} in eukaryotic chromosome evolution are 1) rearrangements of chromosomal segments and 2) localized duplication of genes. Clustering {{could be explained}} by reasoning that all genes in a cluster are originated from tandem duplicates of a common ancestor. If all co-expressed genes in a cluster were evolved from a common ancestral gene it would have been expected that they’re co-expressed <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> have comparable promoters. However, gene clustering is a very common tread in genomes and it isn’t clear how this duplication model could explain all of the clustering. Furthermore, many genes that are present in clusters are not homologous.|$|E

25|$|Three other {{tropical}} genera of {{the family}} Sarcoscyphaceae, Phillipsia, Sarcoscypha, and Geodina, have brightly colored apothecia which might be confused with those of Cookeina. Although these genera may be distinguished microscopically <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> have asci which mature seriatim rather than simultaneously and paraphyses which do not anastomose to form a reticulum, distinguishing {{on the basis of}} macroscopic characters is less reliable. Species of Phyllipsia have apothecia that are saucer-shaped to discoid, thick-fleshed, and usually sessile. In Sarcoscypha the apothecia vary from saucer-shaped to cup-shaped and are usually stipitate. In Geodina the apothecia are cup-shaped, stipitate, and occur on soil. Another similar genus, Scutellinia, has eyelash-like hairs around the margin of a red or orange apothecia, but lacks a stipe.|$|E
25|$|Bjørn Jarle Rødberg Larsen, {{treasurer}} of Oslo AUF from 1992 to 1994, had at first denied {{to testify in}} the case, after advice from his defense attorney, but chose to change his mind. He told the court that the Oslo Labour Party pressured the Oslo AUF to maintain high membership numbers, {{in order to maintain}} their strong influence within AUF. He also told the court that the four accused members tried to keep the money advancements a secret, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> knew that the practice was illegal. He also admitted that the leadership of AUF in the years between 1992 and 1994 conspired to inflate membership numbers in order to receive higher government subsidies. The leadership regularly paid membership fees for those members who did not pay their fees. In 1993, they also decided to pay membership fees for people who had never expressed any desire to be members of AUF. He also admitted that the four of them met at Hornslien's parliament office to discuss the situation after Verdens Gang broke the story.|$|E
25|$|The {{successful}} photochemical {{synthesis of}} krypton difluoride was first reported by Lucia V. Streng in 1963. It was next reported in 1975 by J. Slivnik. The photochemical {{process for the}} production of KrF2 involves the use of UV light and can produce under ideal circumstances 1.22g/h. The ideal wavelengths to use are in the range of 303–313nm. Harder UV radiation is detrimental to the production of KrF2. Using Pyrex glass or Vycor or quartz will significantly increase yield <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> block harder UV light. In a series of experiments performed by S. A Kinkead et al., it was shown that a quartz insert (UV cut off of 170nm) produced on average 158mg/h, Vycor 7913 (UV cut off of 210nm) produced on average 204mg/h and Pyrex 7740 (UV cut off of 280nm) produced on average 507mg/h. It is clear from these results that higher-energy ultraviolet light reduces the yield significantly. The ideal circumstances for the production KrF2 by a photochemical process appear to occur when krypton is a solid and fluorine is a liquid, which occur at 77K. The biggest problem with this method is that it requires the handling of liquid F2 and the potential of it being released if it becomes overpressurized.|$|E

500|$|Some critics find it {{difficult}} to accept Fodor's insistence that a large, perhaps implausible, number of concepts are primitive and undefinable.
