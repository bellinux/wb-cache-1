5|$|Since {{they are}} morally equivalent, {{perhaps it is}} not {{surprising}} that the cure for political injustices is identical to the cure for economic ones: namely, the institution of democracy in <b>both</b> <b>economic</b> and political spheres (Russell 1938:234).|$|E
5|$|The Marcellus {{natural gas}} trend, which {{encompasses}} 104,000 square miles and stretches across Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and into southeast Ohio and upstate New York, {{is the largest}} source of natural gas in the United States, and production was still growing rapidly in 2013. The Marcellus {{is an example of}} shale gas, natural gas trapped in low-permeability shale, and requires the well completion method of hydraulic fracturing to allow the gas to flow to the well bore. The surge in drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale since 2008 has generated <b>both</b> <b>economic</b> benefits and environmental concerns—and thus, considerable controversy.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the auspices}} of a régime d'exception (the {{equivalent}} {{of a state of}} emergency), Mobutu assumed sweeping, almost absolute, power for five years after which, he claimed, democracy would be restored. Mobutu's coup, which promised <b>both</b> <b>economic</b> and political stability, was supported by the United States and other Western governments. Initially, his rule met widespread popularity. He increasingly took other powers, abolishing the post of Prime Minister in 1966 and dissolving Parliament in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Sihanouk came {{to believe}} that {{communist}} triumph in Southeast Asia was inevitable and that Cambodia's military was incapable of defeating the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), even with U.S. support. If Cambodia (and his rule) was to survive, he would have to make a bargain with the devil. On 10 April 1965 he broke off diplomatic relations with the U.S. and swung politically to the left. To gain foreign support, <b>both</b> <b>economic</b> and political, Sihanouk turned to the People's Republic of China. One of the terms of the agreement between Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai was that Cambodia would allow the use of its eastern border by the North Vietnamese in their effort to reunify the two Vietnams.|$|E
