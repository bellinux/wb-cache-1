It's nice to know we'll be <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> good old regular Earth-1 team for the foreseeable future. Overall, this week was really well done - very effectively creepy, well directed and plotted {{with just the right}} about of gore to make you jump". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "Marionette" [...] the eleventh best episode of the series, calling it [...] "a strong, disturbing outing that was part of Fringes mid-series peak, in which the show found its best storytelling voice by crafting strange, emotionally resonant case-of-the-week plots that thematically paralleled the ongoing character arcs in ways that felt organic, not contrived." [...] In a similar 2013 list, Den of Geek ranked the episode as the third best of the entire series.|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah {{was known}} to have usually been {{accompanied}} by {{members of her family}} and the [...] "Rock the Boat" [...] filming was credited by Rashad Haughton as being the first and only time her family was not present. In October 2001, Rashad stated: [...] "It really boggles everyone [...] from Day One, every single video she ever shot there's always been myself or my mother or my father there. The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because my mother had eye surgery and couldn't fly. That really bothered her because she always traveled. My dad {{had to take care of}} my mom at that time. And I went to Australia to visit some friends. We really couldn't understand why we weren't there. You ask yourself maybe we could have stopped it. But you can't really answer the question. There's always gonna be that question of why." [...] Her friend Kidada Jones said in the last year of her life her parents had given her more freedom and she had talked about wanting a family. [...] "She wanted to have a family, and we talked about how we couldn't wait to kick <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> babies." ...|$|E

"I kenned {{his father}} weel; aye, and was close beside him at Culloden, for when our company was broken I joined {{one that was}} making a stand, close by, and it was Drummond who was leading it.

6000|$|While Jeanne {{was doing}} this, Harry {{fastened}} a rope to a {{ring in the}} side of the hatch, then he tied the corks on to Jeanne's shoulders, and adjusted the third bundle to his own. [...] "Now, Jeanne," [...] he said, [...] "I will tell you what we are going to do. You see this hatch; when the vessel sinks it will float, and we must float on <b>our</b> <b>backs</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> faces underneath it so that it will hide us from the sight of the wretches on shore; and even if they put out in boats to kill any who may be swimming or clinging to spars, they will not suspect that there is anyone under this. We may not succeed; an accident may betray us, but there is a possibility. At anyrate, dear, we shall live or die together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was well}} thought of. Come, ride here between the Prince and me, {{and we will}} {{believe that we are}} <b>back</b> in France <b>with</b> <b>our</b> war harness on our backs once more. What is your news, Master John?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not at all, father. Until today, {{nobody has}} been into this room besides {{ourselves}} and that woman. The door was generally left a little open for air, for {{you see there}} are no windows here. She used {{to go into the}} next room and come <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> food. We could see men moving about in there, but they were very quiet, and all spoke in low tones.|$|E
6000|$|Here Ayesha had halted and {{was engaged}} in the contemplation of this boulder-strewn path, as though she meditated making use of it that day. Now we drew near to her, and the priest who guided us fell <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> guard, leaving us to go forward alone, since they dared not {{approach}} the Hesea unbidden. Leo was somewhat in advance of me, seven or eight yards perhaps, and I heard him say--"Why dost thou venture into such places at night, Ayesha, unless indeed {{it is not possible}} for any harm to come to thee?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let's {{carelessly}} float {{that way}} as if going for seaweed on the rocks. She can't {{mind if we}} are flat on <b>our</b> <b>backs,</b> <b>with</b> only <b>our</b> noses out.

That will impress her, and she may call to thank the very polite young ladies who respect her wishes,' proposed Josie, whose lively fancy was always planning dramatic situations.|$|R

60|$|Time {{and again}} the ferocious apes sprang in to close with us, and time and again we beat them <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> swords. The great tails of the plant men lashed with {{tremendous}} power about us as they charged from various directions or sprang with the agility of greyhounds above our heads; but every attack met a gleaming blade in sword hands that had been reputed for twenty years the best that Mars ever had known; for Tars Tarkas and John Carter were names that the fighting men {{of the world of}} warriors loved best to speak.|$|E
6000|$|Thus our cruise ended; {{and thus}} we falsified the {{predictions}} of our prudent friends, and came <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> right side uppermost. [...] "Here's luck to you, gentlemen!"--was the toast which our honest sailor-brothers proposed, when we met together later in the day, and pledged {{each other in a}} parting cup. [...] "Here's luck," [...] we answered, on our side--"luck to the Brothers Dobbs; and thanks besides for hearty companionship and faithful service." [...] And here, in the last glass with one cheer more,--here's luck to the vessel that carried us, our lively little Tomtit! Tiny home of joyous days, may thy sea-fortunes be happy, and thy trim sails be set prosperously for many a year still, to the favouring breeze! ...|$|E
60|$|We {{looked around}} for him, and found him. He was severely, I may even say dangerously, wounded. The bullet had lodged in his right side. We had to catch our two horses, and ride them <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> wounded man, leading the fugitive's mare in tow, all blown and breathless. I stuck to the fugitive's mare; {{it was the one}} clue we had now against him. But Sebastian, if it WAS Sebastian, had ridden off scot-free. I {{understood}} his game at a glance. He had got the better of us once more. He would make for the coast by the nearest road, give himself out as a settler escaped from the massacre, and catch the next ship for England or the Cape, now this coup had failed him.|$|E
60|$|Hearing this, I {{penetrated}} {{for myself}} the motive which had actuated Nugent--as I afterwards found it {{indicated in the}} Journal. If he had let Lucilla go to Grosse, our good German might have noticed that her position was preying on her mind, and might have seen his reasons for exposing the deception that Nugent was practicing on her. For the rest, I still persisted in entreating Lucilla to go <b>back</b> <b>with</b> me to <b>our</b> old friend.|$|R
60|$|While we {{were still}} applauding the first act, Rothsay alarmed me: he dropped from his seat at my side, like a man struck dead. The {{stifling}} heat in the theater had proved too much for him. We carried him out at once into the fresh air. When he came to his senses, my friend entreated me to leave him, and {{see the end of}} the play. To my mind, {{he looked as if he}} might faint again. I insisted on going <b>back</b> <b>with</b> him to <b>our</b> hotel.|$|R

60|$|I {{had little}} time to dwell upon the {{coincidence}} of the simultaneous failure of the wireless and the buoyancy generators, since very shortly after the Coldwater had dropped so low over the waters that all my attention was necessarily centered upon the delicate business of settling upon the waves without breaking my ship's <b>back.</b> <b>With</b> <b>our</b> buoyancy generators in commission {{it would have been}} a simple thing to enter the water, since then it would have been but a trifling matter of a forty-five degree dive into the base of a huge wave. We should have cut into the water like a hot knife through butter, and have been totally submerged with scarce a jar--I have done it a thousand times--but I did not dare submerge the Coldwater for fear that it would remain submerged to the end of time--a condition far from conducive to the longevity of commander or crew.|$|E

Then he knows--and then only--that there can BE no {{standard}} but ours. But we are constantly going away, and coming <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> convictions shaken to their foundations. One man goes to England, and returns with the conception of a grander social life; another comes home from Germany {{with the notion of}} a more searching intellectual activity; a fellow just back from Paris has the absurdest ideas of art and literature; and you revert to us from the cowboys of Texas, and tell us to our faces that we ought to try Papa Lapham by a jury of his peers. It ought to be stopped--it ought, really. The Bostonian who leaves Boston ought to be condemned to perpetual exile." ...|$|E
60|$|As Otomie spoke I heard {{a trumpet}} blare without the walls. Hurrying {{to the gates}} by the first light of day, I {{could see that the}} Spaniards were {{mustering}} their forces for attack. They did not come at once, however, but delayed till the sun was well up. Then they began to pour a furious fire upon our defences, that reduced the shattered beams of the gates to powder, and even shook down the crest of the earthwork beyond them. Suddenly the firing ceased and again a trumpet called. Now they charged us in column, a thousand or more Tlascalans leading the van, followed by the Spanish force. In two minutes I, who awaited them beyond it together with some three hundred warriors of the Otomie, saw their heads appear over the crest of the earthwork, and the fight began. Thrice we drove them <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> spears and arrows, but at the fourth charge the wave of men swept over our defence, and poured into the dry ditch beyond.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} bringing a distributed system to a consistent state after transient failures. We address the two components of this problem by describing a distri-buted algorithm to create consistent checkpoints, {{as well as a}} rollback-recovery algorithm to recover the system to a consistent state. In contrast to previous algorithms, they tolerate failures that occur during their executions. Furth-ermore, when a process takes a checkpoint, a minimal number of additional processes are forced to take check-points. Similarly, when a process rolls back and restarts after a failure, a minimal number of additional processes are forced to roll <b>back</b> <b>with</b> it. <b>Our</b> algorithms require each process to store at most two checkpoints in stable storage. This storage requirement is shown to be minimal under general assumptions. 1...|$|R

When I got <b>back</b> <b>with</b> the boys, <b>our</b> plan was to rush you down to the hotel, but it wasn't Stannard's. I allow we were rattled; he was cool. We must go slow and not jolt you; at awkward spots {{somebody}} must look for the smoothest line. Crossing the glacier, he went ahead with the lantern and located a soft snow-bridge the guide was going to cross." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will, of course, take {{possession}} of the tent also, Sir Oswald. Sir William {{was one of my}} knights. He was unwedded, and has no male kin; therefore, you need have no hesitation in taking his belongings; which indeed we should, in any case, have little chance of taking <b>back</b> <b>with</b> us, for <b>our</b> waggons are but few, and will daily become fewer: for on such roads as these, both waggons and horses break down, and it will be {{as much as we can}} do to carry even necessities with us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Allemachter!" [...] groaned Coetzee, [...] "what did I tell you? The poor rooibaatjes {{shot down}} like buck, {{and the land}} running with blood! And now that Frank Muller will draw me into it, and I shall {{have to go and}} shoot the poor rooibaatjes; and I can't miss, try as hard as I will, I can't miss. And when we have shot them all I suppose that Burgers will come back, and he is kransick (mad). Yes, yes; Lanyon is bad, but Burgers is worse," [...] and the {{comfortable}} old gentleman groaned aloud at the troubles in which he foresaw he would be involved, and finally took his departure by a bridle-path over the mountain, saying that, as things had turned out, he would not like it to be known that he had been calling on an Englishman. [...] "They might think that I was not loyal to the 'land,'" [...] he added in explanation; [...] "the land which we Boers bought with our blood, and which we shall win <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> blood, whatever the poor 'pack oxen' of rooibaatjes try to do. Ah, those poor, poor rooibaatjes, one Boer will drive away twenty of them and make them run across the veldt, if they can run in those great knapsacks of theirs, with the tin things hanging round them like the pots and kettles to the bed-plank of a waggon. What says the Holy Book? 'One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one, and at the rebuke of five shall ye flee,' at least I think that is it. The dear Lord knew what was coming when He wrote it. He was thinking of the Boers and the poor rooibaatjes," [...] and Coetzee departed, shaking his head sadly.|$|E
5000|$|Eagles of Death Metal {{issued a}} {{statement}} about the attacks on 18 November, stating their horror about the attacks and their sympathy {{with friends and family}} of the victims, and thanking survivors, authorities, and French and American police. White Miles offered their condolences on that day as well, saying: [...] "We are happy, but miserable at the same time. Happy, because we are <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> families, who help immensely to make us feel safe again; miserable, because we know that many families have to mourn following the weekend."

I am but half a soldier; I love the renown, {{but not the}} trade of war. Before the battle of Rodosto I was full of hope and spirit; to conquer there, and afterwards to take Constantinople, was the hope, the bourne, the fulfilment of my ambition. This enthusiasm is now spent, I know not why; I seem to myself to be entering a darksome gulph; the ardent spirit of the army is irksome to me, the rapture of triumph null." ...|$|R

Sir Jervis is not of a communicative disposition. At least, not to me. A man--that explains it--a man!
