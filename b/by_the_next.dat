5|$|A weather system {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September3. The {{disturbance}} was small and became unidentifiable within 24hours of formation. Satellite imagery indicated that the disturbance may have acquired a circulation on September7, but the circulation was gone <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day. The remaining tropical wave moved into the Lesser Antilles on September11 and a reconnaissance aircraft was deployed. The aircraft found circulation; however, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day, only a strong wave was detected. Atmospheric conditions became more favorable for development, yielding lower wind shear near Hispaniola for several days. The system moved into this area as the latest Reconnaissance aircraft was deployed, declaring it a tropical depression on September13 near the Dominican Republic.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} Tropical Storm Barbara over the Bahamas on August11. It intensified {{as it moved}} north-northwestward, becoming a hurricane <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day, and reaching peak winds of 90mph (150km/h) just south of Cape Hatteras on August13. Barbara moved over the Outer Banks, passing between Morehead City and Ocracoke, and it turned and accelerated to the northeast. Steadily weakening and losing tropical characteristics, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on August15. It turned northward, crossing eastern Nova Scotia and dissipating over Labrador on August16.|$|E
5|$|After gaining {{tropical}} characteristics {{throughout most}} of the day on November3, the storm was designated Tropical Depression Eleven. The depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Florence, the sixth named storm of the season. The storm briefly underwent rapid intensification, strengthening into a hurricane, before leveling out as a Category 1 hurricane. Florence was subsequently upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane on November7. However, a large extratropical cyclone located to the north caused the hurricane to rapidly accelerate, with forward speeds reaching 58mph (93km/h). <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day, Florence lost its identity, while still producing hurricane-force winds, as it was absorbed by the extratropical cyclone.|$|E

The outer rainbands of this system were expected to bring squally weather over the Baja California Peninsula; instead, this storm turned away without causing any impact.|$|E
