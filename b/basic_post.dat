After the <b>basic</b> <b>post</b> and beam structure of the frame has been set in place, the bents are then lifted and simply dropped into place one by one by the crane. Next, the workers bring in additional members, purlins, which tie them together and give the frame a more rigid structure.

The Ranger Division is a participating agency in P.O.S.T which sets the standards of training for peace officers. In 1996 due to spikes in violent crime in city parks patrolled by the Rangers, the union representing the rangers requested that the Rangers be trained to carry semi-automatic handguns similar to the Police but the request was eventually denied due to opposition from the LAPD and the Parks Department. [...] In 2000 the Parks and Recreation Department and the LAPD attempted to change {{the duties of the}} Park rangers by signing an agreement that would make the LAPD responsible for all arrests made in city parks and that Rangers would only be allowed to make arrests if someone's life was in danger. After strong opposition from the Park rangers, the city council eventually rejected the proposed agreement and Park rangers continued with their original peace officer status.|$|E

40|$|Finding {{satisfactory}} {{explanations of}} deviations from uncovered interest rate parity (UIRP) {{has proved to}} be a frustrating experience for Neoclassical economists. Studies have focused on the role of risk, but thus far no one has been able to put forward a source thereof that can account for the specific pattern of deviations from UIRP. This paper offers an alternative perspective that finally resolves the mystery. Drawing on the work of Marc Lavoie and John Smithin and extending it with some <b>basic</b> <b>Post</b> Keynesian propositions regarding endogenous money, uncertainty, and nonergodicity, it is shown that one can devise a comprehensive explanation of UIRP [...] an explanation that shows that much more than risk is responsible for deviations. In particular, it is argued that Keynes's "confidence" is a vitally important and overlooked factor. This contention is supported by a regression analysis of the U. S. -German and U. S. - Japanese asset markets. confidence, exchange rate, interest rate parity, risk,...|$|E
40|$|Thermoacoustic instabilities usually {{result from}} the {{coupling}} between the oscillatory heat release and one or more natural acoustic modes of the combustion system. When the shifting of system frequencies caused by the unsteady heat release is limited, the calculation of natural modes allows to identify which of them are excited by the flame once changes in flow temperature and composition due to combustion are considered. In this paper, isothermal computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed to predict the natural modes of a heavy-duty gas turbine combustor in reactive conditions. Combustion and heat transfer are neglected in the numerical analysis to simplify the model and limit the computational effort. The natural frequencies resulting from isothermal simulations are then corrected using a rather <b>basic</b> <b>post</b> processing approach to account for temperature and gas composition changes due to combustion process. Frequency and amplitude of the calculated modes are finally compared to experimental measurements to evaluate {{the ability of the}} acoustic analysis to capture frequency and spatial shape of the combustor natural modes excited by the flame...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} tagged release of the XChannel model. XChannel has been {{developed}} {{as a framework for}} testing the influence of different bank erosion formulations on morphological evolution of a single cross-section. This release contains the model used to produce outputs for the draft manuscript A framework for the analysis of bank erosion algorithms in morphodynamic modeling by G. Stecca, R. Measures and D. M. Hicks. Details XChannel runs in Matlab. The main function is XChannel. m which requires an input parameter file in the format shown in the Selwyn River example. By default XChannel saves outputs (animation, and snapshots of cross-section shape) into the same folder as the input parameters file. SensitivityAnalysis. m performs automated sensitivity testing of different bank erosion formulations and was developed specifically for the bank erosion framework paper. OutputBankPosTS. m performs <b>basic</b> <b>post</b> processing to extract time series of bank position. History The concepts implemented in XChannel are a development of an earlier spreadsheet based cross-section evolution model. XChannel has been verified by comparing it's results with those of the spreadsheet based model. Future developments It is intended that the core XChannel model will have wider applicability to analysis of cross-section evolution and testing of all cross-channel morphological processes in 2 D morphological modelling. To enable this it is planned to improve model documentation (issue # 2) and separate the core XChannel model from the sensitivity testing routines developed specifically for the bank erosion framework paper (issue # 1).
