5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is <b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a defendant is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be admissible.|$|E

5|$|He was {{generally}} more highly regarded for his batting than his wicket-keeping, often drawing criticism {{for the quality}} of his glovework. Despite this, he was at times considered to be a better wicket-keeper than two of his rivals for England; Bairstow and Buttler. Nonetheless, playing in an era when international teams did not play specialist wicket-keepers, Kieswetter's selection was <b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> upon his batting ability, rather than his keeping ability. For a couple of matches during 2012, he was used as an off spin bowler by Somerset, collecting three wickets.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group, <b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> at Pennsylvania State University, was established. Their {{preliminary}} report pointed out some patterns, but drew no strong conclusions. A survey of beekeepers early in 2007 indicated most hobbyist beekeepers believed that starvation {{was the leading}} cause of death in their colonies, while commercial beekeepers overwhelmingly believed invertebrate pests (Varroa mites, honey bee tracheal mites, and/or small hive beetles) were {{the leading cause of}} colony mortality. A scholarly review in June 2007 similarly addressed numerous theories and possible contributing factor, but left the issue unresolved.|$|E
5|$|In late 1916 Fisher {{and another}} {{prominent}} Bible Student at the Brooklyn headquarters, Clayton J.

5|$|In the English towns the {{burgage tenure}} for urban {{properties}} was established {{early on in}} the medieval period, and was <b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> on tenants paying cash rents rather than providing labour services. Further development of a set of taxes that could be raised by the towns included murage for walls, pavage for streets, and pontage, a temporary tax for the repair of bridges. Combined with the lex mercatoria, which was a set of codes and customary practices governing trading, these provided a reasonable basis for the economic governance of the towns.|$|E
5|$|It remains likely, however, {{that it was}} {{constructed}} by Gundulf, <b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> {{on the history of}} the land holdings during the period. After the founding of the abbey, which Gundulf granted some of his lands around West Malling, St Leonard's became the administrative centre of Gundulf's remaining estates, before also being given to the nuns a few years later, shortly after his death in 1108. In practice, probably only Gundulf would therefore have had the time or motivation to build such a keep during this period.|$|E

Staff members from each of the Allentown School District's schools will attend the meeting in order to overhaul the plan.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{reinforcement}} {{effort to}} Guadalcanal was delayed, the Japanese {{did not give}} up trying to complete the original mission, albeit a day later than originally planned. On the afternoon of 13 November, Tanaka and the 11transports resumed their journey toward Guadalcanal. A Japanese force of cruisers and destroyers from the 8th Fleet (<b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> at Rabaul and originally assigned to cover the unloading of the transports {{on the evening of}} 13 November) was given the mission that Abe's force had failed to carry out—the bombardment of Henderson Field. The battleship Kirishima, after abandoning its rescue effort of Hiei on the morning of 13 November, steamed north between Santa Isabel and Malaita Islands with her accompanying warships to rendezvous with Kondo's Second Fleet, inbound from Truk, to form the new bombardment unit.|$|E
