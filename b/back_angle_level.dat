40|$|A {{large amount}} of fine {{granular}} materials (< 6 mm) are produced during the mining of oil shale. The combustion characteristics of oil shale improve with decreasing size of these materials, for which reason fine-grain oil shale has a high utility value. However, fine oil shale also contains {{a significant amount of}} inorganic mineral impurities which can be reduced by physical separation to improve the oil quality. Based on an analysis of the physical properties of oil shale, this paper proposes a compound dry separation process for the cleaning of < 6 mm oil shale grains. The effects of the vibration intensity, air velocity, and <b>back</b> <b>angle</b> of the employed separator on the separation results and oil content of the cleaned oil shale were systematically analyzed.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the ISO 5353 Seat Index Point Tool (SIPT) {{as an alternative}} to the SAE J 826 H-point manikin for measuring military seats. A tool was fabricated based on the ISO specification and a custom backangle measurement probe was designed and fitted to the SIPT. Comparisons between the two tools in a wide range of seating conditions showed that the mean SIP location was 5 mm aft of the H-point, with a standard deviation of 7. 8 mm. Vertical location was not significantly different between the two tools (mean - 0. 7 mm, sd 4. 0 mm). A high correlation (r= 0. 9) was observed between the <b>back</b> <b>angle</b> measurements from the two tools. The SIPT was slightly more repeatable across installations and installers than the J 826 manikin, with most of the discrepancy arising from situations with flat seat cushion angles and either unusually upright or reclined <b>back</b> <b>angles</b> that caused the J 826 manikin to be unstable. The investigators who performed the measurements indicated that the SIPT was easier to use. The data show that the SIPT is a reasonable substitute for the SAE J 826 manikin when ease-of-use considerations favor the SIPT, such as restricted space around the seat, low seat heights, or low cushion angles. Human posture measurements in seats with large discrepancies between the tools will be needed to determine which provides a better prediction of sitter position...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} <b>back</b> <b>angle</b> and leg height on sitting {{forces in a}} {{wheelchair}} were studied, using a force plate mounted on a wheelchair seat. Readings of both normal force (perpen-dicular to the seat) and shear force were measured while the chair's <b>back</b> <b>angle</b> and footrest height were changed. Pressure under the ischial tuberosities was also measured during the footrest height adjustments. Five normal subjects sat directly on the plate as well as upon ROHO and Jay cushions placed on the force plate. Returning the back to the upright position after a recline caused the normal force (± SD) to increase 5. 4 ± 2. 5, 9. 5 ± 4. 0, and 10. 0 ± 2. 3 kg for the hard surface, Jay cushion, and ROHO cushion respectively, while shear at the plate increased to 5. 1 ± 2. 2, 11. 6 ± 2. 6, and 12. 3 ± 2. 7 kg for the hard surface, Jay cushion, and ROHO cushion respectively. Leaning forward (away from the back) caused all the forces to return to measurements close to the starting values. The {{results suggest that the}} wheelchair user should momentarily lean forward after a recline to reduce undesired forces. If a cushion with firm thigh support is used, ischial tuberosity pressure can be reduced by lowering the leg height as much as possible, which causes a levering action by lifting the pelvis.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the effects of coordinated upper-limb body postures on the subjective discomfort rating, heart rate, and muscle activities. Background: Although generally many checklists such as OWAS, RULA, and REBA were applied to evaluate various body postures, the body postures were might be overestimated or underestimated because each body part(i. e., back, shoulder, and elbow etc.) was evaluated separately, and then added all rates of individual body parts to assess an overall risk level for the body posture in these methodologies. Methods: A total of 20 participants maintained 14 postures which were combinations of back, shoulder, and elbow flexion angles and then muscle activities, subjective discomfort, and heart rates were collected every three minute during a sustained 15 minute and 0. 5 kg weight holding task. Four muscle groups were investigated: erector spine, anterior deltoid, upper trapezius, triceps brachii. Results: Results showed that subjective discomfort was the lowest when the <b>angle</b> of <b>back</b> and shoulder were both 0 °s, while the body posture with 45 ° of <b>back</b> <b>angle</b> and 45 ° shoulder angle was rated as the most subjective discomfort posture. In general, the subjective discomfort ratings increased as back and shoulder flexion angles increased.
