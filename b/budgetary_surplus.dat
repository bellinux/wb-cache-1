40|$|Canadian federal {{government}} registered 11 consecutive <b>budgetary</b> <b>surpluses</b> between 1997 and 2007. In the Canadian context, the federal surplus often has two components: the planned component and the surprise component; the latter appearing when the actual budgetary balance exceeds the planned surplus. This paper discusses whether the constantly reappearing federal budget surprise surpluses are a desirable attribute of the budgetary policy. To this end, the paper presents {{a brief overview}} of the federal surplus, the main causes leading to their reappearance, and examines negative implications associated with federal surpluses. The analysis shows that surprise surpluses may lead to eroding the credibility of the budget process, increasing pressure to spend the excessive fiscal room, pro-cyclical nature of fiscal policy and eroded vigilance of maintaining a steady level of spending. Inaccurate budget projections, but also the invisible political pressure to avoid deficits are among the main causes of the surprise surpluses. national budget, budget surplus, national debt, budget forecasting...|$|R

40|$|This article {{studies the}} rise of {{organizational}} corruption by public hospitals in China since the 1990 s and its impacts. Organizational corruption refers to the exploitation of public authority by a government agency for its monetary or material gains. This article argues {{that a combination of}} three major factors contributed to {{the rise of}} organizational corruption by public hospitals. First, the Chinese government substantially reduced its financial commitment to the health sector since the mid- 1980 s. To compensate for the retrenchment of government health outlays, public hospitals are authorized to earn revenue, keep and use all <b>budgetary</b> <b>surpluses.</b> This policy provided numerous opportunities and incentives for hospitals to engage in corruption. The second factor concerns the excessive and chaotic development of the pharmaceutical sector. Intense competition has prompted many drug firms to offer bribes to public hospitals so that their products would be purchased. Finally, the state regulatory infrastructure has failed to check the spread of corrupt practices. The study raised two broader implications. First, it highlights the pitfall of retrenchment of government outlays and the subsequent policy of allowing state agencies to generate, retain and use the revenue, {{in the absence of an}} effective regulatory infrastructure. Second, the prevalence of organizational corruption indicates that the nature of public hospitals in China has been transformed. Instead of providing efficient, safe and affordable treatment for patients, many public hospitals have engaged in predatory behavior that is harmful to patients’ health...|$|R
40|$|Under what {{conditions}} are budget institutions {{likely to be}} strengthened? We find that fiscal deficits do not help in focusing policymakers on undertaking reforms. To the contrary, the larger the deficit, the lower is the likelihood of reforms. Large deficits apparently imply strong claims on the budget and, hence, generate unwillingness to impose self-discipline. As such, countries will tend to move either to small fiscal deficits and good institutions or large deficits and weak institutions. Economic shocks (if they are large enough) can help build a constituency for improving budget institutions. However, if forgiving markets accommodate economic shocks, even such pressure may be insufficient. Forwardlooking and credible leadership {{appears to be an}} important ingredient of the solution.
