40|$|The {{objective}} {{of research is}} to find out (1) the background of monetary policy enactment in Soeharto times during 1966 - 1971; (2) the monetary policy in Soeharto times during 1966 - 1971; (3) the implementation of monetary policy in Soeharto times during 1966 - 1971; and (4) the impact of monetary policy in Soeharto times on the economical and political sectors during 1966 - 1971. This research used a historical method. The data source employed was written primary and secondary sources. The data of research was collected using literary study technique. Technique of collecting data employed in this study was a historical analysis technique. The research procedure included heuristic, criticism, interpretation, and historiography. Based on the result of research, it can be conclusion that: (1) the background of monetary policy enactment in Soeharto times during 1966 - 1971 was the monetary riots, the production disruption, commercial balance deficit, as well as the government’s increased budget deficit, foreign debt, demoralization, all of which are the inheritances from Soekarno government; (2) the monetary policy in Soeharto times during 1966 - 1971 was based on the MPRS Provision No. XXIII/MPRS/ 1966 on July 5 about the Reformation of Economical, Financial and Development Foundation Policy. Such MRS provision required an integral economic-financial policy, pertaining two inseparable sides: physical production and monetary aspects. Therefore, New Order government undertook an economical policy prioritizing the monetary stability by making monetary policy coordination, fiscal policy or other macroeconomic policy supporting the economical stabilization and rehabilitation; (3) the implementation of monetary policy in Soeharto times during 1966 - 1971 began with the scheduling of foreign debt and asking for foreign grant to create a balanced budget and to recover Indonesian economy. Along with it, the government made the attempts of saving mobilization, credit distribution to the priority sectors in economy, and adjustment of high interest rate as well as the recovery of single exchange value; (4) the impact of monetary policy in Soeharto times on the economical and political sectors during 1966 - 1971 in economic sector included the success of reducing the growth rate of circulating money and inflation rate, the improvement of public saving mobilization, balanced <b>budget</b> <b>establishment,</b> the more stable export and import value corresponding to Indonesian economic requirement and the recovery of capital flow to home.

40|$|Fiscal {{policy choices}} have a {{particularly}} {{significant impact on}} economic performance in oil-exporting countries, owing {{to the importance of}} the oil sector in the economy and the fact that in most countries oil revenues accrue to the government. At the same time, fiscal policy in oil-centred economies s facing specific challenges, both in the long run, as regards intergenerational equity and fiscal sustainability, and in the short run, as regards macroeconomic stabilisation and fiscal planning. Institutional responses to the specific fiscal challenges in oil-exporting countries involve conservative oil price assumptions in the <b>budget,</b> the <b>establishment</b> of oil stabilisation and savings funds and fiscal rules. Fiscal policy in most oil-exporting countries has been expansionary over the past years in the wake of high oil prices. Fiscal expansion has added to inflationary pressure, and monetary policy has been constrained in tackling inflation as a result of prevailing exchange rate regimes. While, in this context, fiscal policy is the major tool for macroeconomic stabilisation, it has faced competing objectives and considerations. Cyclical considerations would have warranted fiscal restraint, but, in times of high oil prices, pressures to increase public spending have been mounting. Such pressures stem from primarily distribution-related considerations, development-related spending needs (e. g. in the areas of physical and social infrastructure) and international considerations in the context of, for example, global imbalances. The sharp fall in oil prices since mid- 2008 has brought to the fore a different question – whether oil exporters can sustain spending levels reached in previous years.

The national fiscal crisis and rising debt of the U. S. have each placed increased scrutiny on military systems acquisition and procurement practices. The Defense Department is pushing for greater emphasis on fundamental systems engineering practices earlier in the acquisition phase, with the expectation of fewer schedule slips and budget overruns. The acquisition of PHM systems could also benefit from increased systems engineering rigor early in their development. A 2007 directive from the DoD states that PHM systems be implemented into current weapon systems equipment, and materiel sustainment programs where technically feasible and beneficial. This research examines the definition of PHM requirements and a method for developing a solution neutral architecture for PHM systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{research}} aims {{to explain}} {{the percentage of the}} contribution of Regional Own Revenues to Local Government <b>Budget.</b> In every <b>establishment</b> of new autonomy region, it is assumed that it would make the community prosperous by exploring and using all available resources. Apart from that, this research also aims to describe the steps that have been taken by the governments in improving Regional Own Revenues. The research finds that the realization of the budget in 2006, 2007 and 2008 shows that the percentage of such contribution to local government budget is very little compared to the contribution comes from other sources. As a result, the income of such areas is mostly depended on the budget given by central government through the balancing budget known as the General Allocation Grant. According to the data of the realization of Regional Own Revenues for the Local Government Budget in 2006, 2007 and 2008, there was no district or municipality which the contribution higher than 10 %. The average contribution during the years had been 5. 04 %. Ideally, all local government budget especially the regular budget, should be similar to the Regional Own Revenues. This lack of contribution indicates that such local governments were really strongly depended on central government in terms of regular budget and budget for development through the balancing budget. In other words, it could be said that the local governments that are unable to balance between the regular budget and the Regional Own Revenues do not deceive to be called as autonomy governments.           The Contribution of Regional own Revenues as a Success Indicator of Regional Autonomy’s Implementatio...|$|R

In February 2012, GAO found that FEMA lacked a process to coordinate application reviews and made award decisions with differing levels of information. To better identify potential unnecessary duplication, GAO recommended that FEMA collect project-level information and enhance internal coordination and administration of the programs. DHS concurred and has taken steps to address GAO's recommendations. For example, the fiscal year 2013 and 2014 President's <b>budgets</b> proposed the <b>establishment</b> of the National Preparedness Grant Program (NPGP), a consolidation of 16 FEMA grant programs into a single program. Members of Congress raised questions about the NPGP and did not approve the proposal for fiscal year 2013. FEMA incorporated stakeholder views, as directed by Congress, and the fiscal year 2014 President's Budget again proposed the NPGP. If approved, and depending on its final form and execution, the NPGP could help mitigate the potential for unnecessary duplication and address GAO's recommendation to improve internal coordination. In March 2013, FEMA officials reported that the agency intends to start collecting and analyzing project-level data from grantees in fiscal year 2014; but has not yet finalized data requirements or fully implemented the data system to collect the information.

40|$|Uncorrected {{refractive}} error {{is the leading}} cause of visual impairment. The societal costs of this impairment are substantial and the costs of reducing the burden relatively small. Due to their limited resources, developing countries are over-represented in the 153 million people with distance uncorrected {{refractive error}} and over 500 million with near uncorrected refractive error (presbyopia). Spectacles provide a low cost and readily available solution to the problem, but there is no general consensus on how this should be achieved. The aim of this thesis was to develop a model for an effective method of providing spectacles for correction of refractive error in developing countries and regions. Among the hypotheses tested were: that selection of ready-made spectacles can be guided by frame size and wearer&# 146;s PD; that there is a power threshold below which ready-made spectacles can be supplied without the need for expensive quality control; that custom-made spectacles should be the preferred form of correction for powers greater than this threshold; that recycled spectacles are not cost effective; and that achievement of the goals of the WHO/IAPB initiative, Vision 2020 :The Right to Sight, will require the establishment of sustainable local infrastructure, including trained staff who are able to provide refraction and dispensing services and the production of custom-made spectacles for those unsuited to read-made spectacles on an ongoing basis. A model was developed based on the results of tests carried out on ready-made spectacles and analysis of current practice and options for correction. Sustainability was an underlying principle of the model design. It includes protocols for quality control of ready-made and custom-made spectacles, the training of staff capable of producing custom-made spectacles and <b>budgeting</b> for the <b>establishment</b> of optical facilities using a cost minimisation approach...|$|R
