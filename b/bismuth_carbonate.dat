40|$|The thermal {{degradation}} is studied of the mixture, melamine hydrobromide-free radical initiator-basic <b>bismuth</b> <b>carbonate</b> {{which is a}} very effective fire retardant for polypropylene. Melamine hydrobromide condenses on heating, evolving ammonia and ammonium bromide. The melamine condensate then undergoes complete volatilisation above 540 °C with evolution of nitrogen-containing species. Addition of the free radical initiator does not appreciably affect the {{thermal degradation}} behaviour of melamine hydrobromide. Further addition of basic <b>bismuth</b> <b>carbonate</b> strongly modifies the volatilisation of nitrogen-containing species and leads to evolution of bismuth tribromide. On addition to polypropylene, the thermal degradation of the ternary mixture is further modified with formation of metallic bismuth. Implications of thermal degradation behaviour on fire retardance mechanism are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The fire {{retardant}} characteristics of additives based on mixtures of melamine hydrobromide-free radical initiator-basic <b>bismuth</b> <b>carbonate</b> (or antimony trioxide) are discussed {{on the basis}} of the dependence of oxygen index on composition in the case of polypropylene. It is shown that the free radical initiator enhances the effectiveness of the {{fire retardant}} action of melamine hydrobromide. A further significant decrease of flammability, as measured by oxygen index, is induced by addition of the metal compound. Thus, polypropylene can be fire retarded with very small amounts of additive (< 2 %) without excessive formation of smoke which is typical of the most common halogenated additives. This seems to be due to a smoke suppressant activity of the melamine structure. These additives act by a condensed phase mechanism which seems not to be limited to induction of extensive dripping of the polymer on burning...|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of zincate with additives, viz., alkaline earth oxides, cadmium oxide, nickel hydroxide, cobalt hydroxide <b>bismuth</b> oxide, sodium <b>carbonate,</b> and lithium hydroxide is investigated by turbidimetry and Raman spectroscopy. From {{the pattern of}} dependence of turbidity on additive concentration, the additives can be classified into three groups: (i). BeO, CdO, MgO, Ni(OH) 2, Co(OH) 2; (ii) CaO, BaO, SrO; (iii) LiOH, Bi 2 O 3, Na 2 CO 3. An identical grouping of additives has been discerned from Raman spectral analysis. Turbidimetry is a simple inexpensive technique for understanding the processes taking place between the additives and the zincate solution. Products of electrochemical dissolution of zinc in 4 M NaOH containing alkaline earth oxides, SnO, CdO, Ni(OH) 2, CO(OH) 2,or LiOH have been analysed by IR spectroscopy. The effect of heat treatment of the products on IR spectral pattern is described {{in the light of}} thermogravimetric analysis...|$|R
40|$|The Kalahari Goldridge mine {{is located}} within the Archaean Kraaipan Greenstone Belt about 60 km SW of Mafikeng in the Northwestern Province, South Africa. Several gold {{deposits}} are located within approximately north - south-striking banded iron-formation (BIF). Current opencast mining operations {{are focused on the}} largest of these (D Zone). The orebody is stratabound and hosted primarily in the BIF, which consists of alternating chert and magnetite-chloritestilpnomelane-sulphide-carbonate bands ranging from mm to cm scale. The ore body varies in thickness from 15 to 45 m along a strike length of about 1. 5 km. The BlF is sandwiched between a sericite-carbonate-chlorite schist at the immediate footwall and carbonaceous meta-pelites in the hanging-wall. Further west in the footwall, the schists are underlain by mafic meta-volcanic amphibolite. Overlying the hanging-wall carbonaceous metapeiites are schist units and meta-greywackes that become increasingly conglomeratic up the stratigraphy. Stilpnomelane-, chlorite- and minnesotaite-bearing assemblages in the BlFs indicate metamorphic temperatures of 300 - 450 °C and pressures of less than 5 kbars. The BIF generally strikes approximately 3400 and dips from 60 to 75 °E. Brittle-ductile deformation is evidenced by small-scale isoclinal folds, brecciation, extension fractures and boudinaging of cherty BIF units. Fold axial planes are sub-parallel to the foliation orientation with sub-vertical plunges parallel to prominent rodding and mineral lineation in the footwall. Gold mineralization at the Kalahari Goldridge deposit is associated with two generations of subhorizontal quartz-carbonate veins dips approximately 20 to 40 °W. The first generation consists of ladder vein sets (Group lIA) preferentially developed in Fe-rich meso bands, whilst the second generation consists of large quartz-carbonate veins (Group lIB), which crosscut the entire ore body extending into the footwall and hanging-wall in places. Major structures that control the ore body are related to meso-scale isoclinal folds with fold axes subparallel to mineral elongation lineations, which plunge approximately 067 °E. These linear structures form orthogonal orientation with the plane of the mineralized shallowdipping veins indicating stretching and development of fluid - focusing conduits. A second-order controlling feature corresponds to the intersection of the mineralized veins and foliation planes of host rock, plunging approximately 008 °N and trending 341 °. G 0 ld is closely associated with sulphides, mainly pyrite and pyrrhotite {{and to a lesser extent}} with <b>bismuth</b> tellurides, and <b>carbonate</b> gangue. The ore fluid responsible for the gold deposition is in the C-O-H system with increased CH₄ contents attributed to localized hydrolysis reaction between interbedded carbonaceous sediment and ore fluid. The fluid is characterized by significant C 0 ₂ contents and low salinities below 7. 0 wt % NaCl equivalent (averages of 3. 5 and 3. 0 wt % NaCl equivalent for the first and second episodes of the mineralization respectively). Calculated values of f 0 ₂. ranging from 10 ⁻²⁹·⁹⁸ to 10 ⁻³²·⁹⁶ bars, bracket the C 0 ₂-CH₄ and pyrite-pyrrhotite-magnetite buffer boundaries and reveal the reducing nature of the ore fluid at deposition. Calculated total sulphur content in the ore fluid (mΣs), ranges from 0. 011 to 0. 018 M and is consistent with the range (10 ⁻³·⁵ to 10 ⁻¹M) reported for subamphibolite facies ore fluids. The close association of sulphides with the Au and nature of the fluid also give credence that the Au was carried in solution by the Au(HS) ₂ - complex. Extensive epigenetic replacement of magnetite and chlorite in BIF and other meta-pelitic sediments in the deposit by sulphides and carbonates, both on meso scopic and microscopic scales gives evidence of an interaction by a CO₂- and H₂S-bearing fluid with the Fe-rich host rocks in the deposit. This facilitated Au precipitation due to changes in the physico-chemical conditions of the ore fluid such as a decrease in the mΣs and pH leading to the destabilization of the reduced sulphur complexes. Local gradients in f 0 ₂ may account for gold precipitation in places within carbonaceous sediments. The fineness of the gold grams (1000 *Au/(Au + Ag) ranges from 823 to 921. This compares favourably with the fineness reported for some Archaean BIFhosced deposits (851 - 970). Mass balance transfer calculations indicate that major chemical changes associated with the hydrothermal alteration of BIF include enrichment of Au, Ag, Bi, Te, volatiles (S and CO₂), MgO, Ba, K and Rb but significant depletion of SiO₂ and minor losses of Fe₂O₃. In addition, anomalous enrichment of Sc (average, 1247 %) suggests its possible use as an exploration tool in the ferruginous sediments in the Kraaipan greenstone terrane. Evidence from light stable isotopes and fluid inclusions suggests that the mineralized veins crystallized from a single homogeneous fluid source during the two episodes of mineralization under the similar physicochemical conditions. Deposition occurred at temperatures rangmg from 350 to 400 °C and fluid pressures ranging from 0. 7 to 2. 0 kbars. Stable isotope constraints indicate the following range for the hydrothermal fluid; θ¹⁸H₂O = 6. 65 to 10. 48 % 0, 8 ¹³CΣc = - 6. 0 to - 8. 0 % 0 and 8 ³⁴SΣs = + 1. 69 to + 4. 0 % 0. These data do not offer conclusive evidence for the source of fluid associated with the mineralization at the Kalahari Goldridge deposit as they overlap the range prescribed for fluid derived from devolatization of deep-seated volcano-sedimentary piles near the brittle-ductile transition in greenstone belts during prograde metamorphism, and magmatic hydrothermal fluids.

40|$|Magnetoelectric multiferroic BiFeO 3 (BFO) was {{synthesized}} by {{a simple}} carbonate precipitation technique of metal nitrate solutions. X-ray powder diffraction and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the precipitate consists of an intimate mixture of crystalline <b>bismuth</b> <b>carbonate</b> and an amorphous hydroxide of iron. The precipitate yielded BiFeO 3 at an optimal calcination temperature of similar to 560 A degrees C. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed 1 : 1 ratio between Bi and Fe in the oxide. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies confirmed that Fe to be in + 3 oxidation states both in the precipitated powder and BiFeO 3.

40|$|To {{compare the}} quality of calcium {{hydroxide}} paste fillings performed by three different techniques. Sixty extracted maxillary central incisors, with previous root canal treatment, were decoronated and the gutta-percha was completely removed from the root canals. Subsequently, the canals were filled with a calcium hydroxide-based paste composed of calcium hydroxide, <b>bismuth</b> <b>carbonate,</b> and glycerin. The study samples were divided into the following three groups {{on the basis of}} three insertion techniques (n = 20, each) : conventional technique using a hand instrument (MAN), rotary Lentulo spiral (LEN) technique, and a combined technique combining conventional hand files with sonic activation through the EndoActivator device (EA). The quality of fillings was evaluated radiographically by two examiners {{on the basis of the}} amount of voids and the apical limit. The canals filled with LEN or MAN had less void volume compared to the EA technique (P > 0. 01), with no significant differences between them. Considering the apical limits, the three tested techniques showed comparable results (P > 0. 05). A combined approach utilizing hand files with sonic activation showed no enhancements over the LEN or MAN techniques on {{the quality of}} intracanal placement of calcium hydroxide paste...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the interference of the radiopacifiers bismuth oxide (BO), <b>bismuth</b> <b>carbonate</b> (BC), bismuth subnitrate (BS), and zirconiun oxide (ZO) on the solubility, alkalinity and antimicrobial properties of white Portland cement (WPC). The substances were incorporated to PC, at a ratio of 1 : 4 (v/v) and subjected to a solubility test. To evaluate the pH, the cements were inserted into retrograde cavities prepared in simulated acrylic teeth and immediately immersed in deionized water. The pH of the solution was measured at 3, 24, 72 and 168 h. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by a radial diffusion method against the microorganisms S. aureus (ATCC 25923), P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), E. faecalis (ATCC 29212) and C. albicans (ATCC 10231). The zone of microbial growth inhibition was measured after 24 h. The addition of BS and BC increased the solubility of the cement. The pH values demonstrated that all materials produced alkaline levels. At 3 h, BS showed lower pH than WPC (p 0. 05). The materials did not present antimicrobial activity for S. aureus, P. aeruginosas and E. faecalis (p> 0. 05). With regards to C. albicans, all materials formed an inhibition zone, mainly the mixture of WPC with ZO (p< 0. 05). The type of radiopacifier incorporated into WPC interfered with its physical and antimicrobial properties. ZO was found to be a viable radiopacifier that can be used with WPC...|$|E
40|$|In 1933 Levaditi (1) {{reported}} {{the status of}} the prevention and therapy of syphilis with bismuth. In his historical r#{ 233 }sum#{ 233 }he called {{attention to the fact that}} in 1889 Masucci (2) advised the use of bismuth in the treatment of secondary and tertiary syphilis. Baizer (3) undertook the first experimental tests. His experi-ments, however, which were misinterpreted, discouraged him and his work was discontinued. Ehrlich and Karrer (4) in 1908 again used bismuth with arsenic and antimony with no better results than Baizer. The use of bismuth in the treatment of syphilis really resulted from work at the Institute of Pasteur (5), and Sazerac and Levaditi (6) who published their first work in 1922. Following the experimental work of Levaditi and Sazerac their findings were confirmed clinically by L. Fournier and Guenot (7). The credit is due to L. Fournier for the description of the therapeutic activity of bismuth, the influence it exerts on the reaction of the blood, the mode of elimination,’dosage and types of treatment. Again in 1930 W. F. von Oettingen (8) published his work on the absorption, distribution and excretion of bismuth. All of the preliminary work has definitely established the fact that bismuth given intravenously demonstrates too high a toxicity to be safe for administration in the treatment of syphilis. The recognized method of administration today, is the intramuscular injection of one of the various bismuth compounds. The oral administration of bismuth, however, has also been investigated.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the radiopacity of Portland cement {{associated with the}} following radiopacifying agents: bismuth oxide, zinc oxide, lead oxide, bismuth subnitrate, <b>bismuth</b> <b>carbonate,</b> barium sulfate, iodoform, calcium tungstate, and zirconium oxide. A ratio of 20 % radiopacifier and 80 % white Portland cement by weight was used for analysis. Pure Portland cement and dentin served as controls. Cement/radiopacifier and dentin disc-shaped specimens were fabricated, and radiopacity testing was performed according to the ISO 6876 / 2001 standard for dental root sealing materials. Using Insight occlusal films, the specimens were radiographed near to a graduated aluminum stepwedge varying from 2 to 16 mm in thickness. The radiographs were digitized and radiopacity compared with the aluminum stepwedge using Digora software (Orion Corporation Soredex, Helsinki, Finland). The radiographic density data were converted into mmAl and analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and Tukey-Kramer test (alpha = 0. 05). The radiopacity of pure Portland cement was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) than that of dentin, whereas all cement/radiopacifier mixtures were significantly more radiopaque than dentin and Portland cement alone (p < 0. 05). Portland cement/bismuth oxide and Portland cement/lead oxide presented the highest radiopacity values and differed significantly from the other materials (p < 0. 05), whereas Portland cement/zinc oxide presented the lowest radiopacity values of all mixtures (p < 0. 05). All tested substances presented higher radiopacity than that of dentin and may potentially {{be added to the}} Portland cement as radiopacifying agents. However, the possible interference of the radiopacifiers with the setting chemistry, biocompatibility, and physical properties of the Portland cement should be further investigated before any clinical recommendation can be done.
