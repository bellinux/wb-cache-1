50|$|Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) {{is a major}} {{constituent}} of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. These organisms have an inner (or cytoplasmic) membrane and, external to it, a thick (up to 80 nanometer) peptidoglycan layer. The structure of LTA varies between the different species of Gram positive bacteria and may contain long chains of ribitol or glycerol phosphate. LTA is anchored to the cell membrane via a diacylglycerol. It acts as regulator of autolytic wall enzymes (muramidases). It has antigenic properties being able to stimulate specific immune response and is released from the bacterial cells mainly after <b>bacteriolysis</b> induced by lysozyme, cationic peptides from leucocytes, or beta-lactam antibiotics.|$|E

40|$|The virulent fish {{pathogen}} Aeromonas salmonicida {{was rapidly}} killed in vivo when restricted inside a diffusion chamber implanted intraperitoneally in rainbow trout. After {{a period of}} regrowth, the survivors had acquired resistance to host-mediated <b>bacteriolysis,</b> phagocytosis, and oxidative killing, properties which were subsequently lost by growth in vitro. Resistance to <b>bacteriolysis</b> and phagocytosis {{was associated with a}} newly acquired capsular layer revealed by acidic polysaccharide staining and electron microscopy. This capsular layer shielded the underlying, regular surface array (S-layer) from immunogold labeling with a primary antibody to the S-layer protein. Resistance to oxidative killing was mediated by a mechanism not associated with the presence of the capsular layer. An attenuated vaccine strain of A. salmonicida grown in vivo failed to express the capsular layer. Consequently, the in vivo-grown cells of this attenuated strain remained as sensitive to <b>bacteriolysis,</b> and as avidly adherent to macrophages, as the in vitro-grown cells.

Although NspA is highly conserved, the ability of anti-NspA antibodies to bind to or elicit complement-mediated bactericidal activity against diverse Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strains is controversial. To evaluate strain differences in NspA surface accessibility and susceptibility to bactericidal activity, we prepared murine immunoglobulin G 2 a anti-NspA monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and evaluated their functional activity against 10 genetically diverse N. meningitidis serogroup B strains. By colony Western blot, all 10 strains expressed NspA as detected by one or more MAbs. By flow cytometry, two MAbs were found to bind to the bacterial surface of 6 of the 10 strains. In addition, two strains showed variable NspA surface accessibility for the MAbs despite being uniformly positive for NspA expression by colony Western blotting. Only 4 of the 10 strains were susceptible to anti-NspA complement-mediated <b>bacteriolysis.</b> Passively administered MAb protected infant rats from developing bacteremia after challenge with N. meningitidis serogroup B strain 8047 (surface binding positive, susceptible to anti-NspA <b>bacteriolysis),</b> was poorly protective against strain BZ 232 (surface binding variable, resistant to <b>bacteriolysis),</b> and did not protect against strain M 986 (surface binding negative, resistant to <b>bacteriolysis).</b> Finally, NspA {{does not appear to be}} critical for causing bacteremia, as an NspA knockout from strain 8047 was highly virulent in infant rats.

40|$|Abstract Background Cytotoxic T {{lymphocytes}} (CTL) {{and natural}} killer (NK) cells play {{an essential role}} in the host defence against intracellular pathogens such as Listeria, and Mycobacteria. The key mediator of bacteria-directed cytotoxicity is granulysin, a 9 kDa protein stored in cytolytic granules together with perforin and granzymes. Granulysin binds to cell membranes and is subsequently taken up via a lipid raft-associated mechanism. In dendritic cells (DC) granulysin is further transferred via early endosomes to L. innocua -containing phagosomes were <b>bacteriolysis</b> is induced. In the present study we analysed the role of perforin in granulysin-induced intracellular <b>bacteriolysis</b> in DC. Results We found granulysin-induced lysis of intracellular Listeria significantly increased when perforin was simultaneously present. In pulse-chase experiments enhanced <b>bacteriolysis</b> was observed when perforin was added up to 25 minutes after loading the cells with granulysin demonstrating no ultimate need for simultaneous uptake of granulysin and perforin. The perforin concentration sufficient to enhance granulysin-induced intracellular <b>bacteriolysis</b> did not cause permanent membrane pores in Listeria -challenged DC as shown by dye exclusion test and LDH release. This was in contrast to non challenged DC that were more susceptible to perforin lysis. For Listeria-challenged DC, there was clear evidence for an Ca 2 + influx in response to sublytic perforin demonstrating a short-lived change in the plasma membrane permeability. Perforin treatment did not affect granulysin binding, initial uptake or intracellular trafficking to early endosomes. However, enhanced colocalization of granulysin with listerial DNA in presence of perforin was found by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Conclusion The results provide evidence that perforin increases granulysin-mediated killing of intracellular Listeria by enhanced phagosome-endosome fusion triggered by a transient Ca 2 + flux. </p...|$|E

40|$|Diarrhea in {{children}} is often caused by enteropathogen infections that {{might benefit from}} early empirical antibiotic therapy. However, when {{the definition of the}} pathogen requires sophisticated laboratory studies, the etiology of enteritis is not known early in illness. Empirical therapy may be dangerous if the child is infected with a Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strain because antimicrobials may increase Shiga toxin (Stx) release, resulting in increased risk of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with acute renal failure (hemolytic-uremic syndrome [HUS]) and death. There is a need for antimicrobials that would be effective against multiple bacterial enteropathogens yet not induce Stx release or increase the risk of HUS. Rifaximin has been evaluated in adults for treatment of bacterial enteritis and has a good record for safety and efficacy, but it has not been evaluated extensively {{in children}} with gastroenteritis. We therefore evaluated rifaximin's potential for phage induction, drug-induced <b>bacteriolysis,</b> and toxin release in 57 STEC strains (26 O 157 and 31 non-O 157 strains). Growth in ciprofloxacin, a known Stx phage inducer, caused <b>bacteriolysis</b> and release of toxin in 25 / 26 (96 %) O 157 strains and 15 / 31 (48 %) non-O 157 strains. In contrast, rifaximin did not induce phage replication or lysis in any strain. Toxin release in the presence of rifaximin was not different from release in the absence of antibiotic.

40|$|In recent years, {{attention}} {{has focused on}} suppression of immunity in immunocompromised patients. The definition of immunocompromise is impairment {{of the immune system}} caused by a disease or treatment. In addition to disease and treatment, other factors such as exposure to pesticides or toxic chemicals can damage the immune system. An in vitro test was used to assess the ability of monochloroacetic acid (MCA) (CAS number 79 - 11 - 8), dichloroacetic acid (DCA) (CAS number 79 - 43 - 6), trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (CAS number 76 - 03 - 9), and 2, 2 - dichloropropionic acid sodium salt (2, 2 -DCPANa, Dalapon) (CAS number 127 - 20 - 8) to suppress <b>bacteriolysis</b> by hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL). The system for <b>bacteriolysis</b> of Gram-negative bacteria Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, and Pasteurella in Tris-maleate buffer supplemented with EDTA and HEWL developed by Brondz et al. [1 – 4] was used to monitor <b>bacteriolysis</b> of Gram-negative bacteria in the Actinobacillus–Haemophilus–Pasteurella group. The halogenated acetic acid DCA is produced as a toxic artifact of the degradation of TCA and by disinfection of drinking and pool water and industrial waste. Nearly all humans consume DCA in drinking water during their lifetime; the concentration of DCA in drinking water can be higher than that associated with the upper-bound excess life-time cancer risk of 10 – 4 (40 μg/L) [5]. Lysozyme found in tears, saliva, nasal secretions, and excretions from all mucous membranes can break down the cell walls of bacteria and destabilize bacterial membranes. Lysozyme is involved in innate (nonspecific) immunity; the innate immune system is {{the first line of defense}} against invading organisms. Actinobacillus actinomy- cetemcomitans (ATCC 29522), a Gram-negative bacterium whose primary ecological niche is the respiratory tract and oral cavity, provided the peptidoglycan substrate for HEWL. The optical density (OD) of a standardized suspension of A. actinomycetemcomitans decreased from 100 % (OD 0. 6 at 540 nm) to 23. 5 % after exposure to EDTA/HEWL for 50 min. After 50 min of exposure to 10. 0 mg/mL of MCA, DCA, TCA, or 2, 2 -DCPANa as a supplement, EDTA/HEWL-induced lysis of A. actinomycetemcomitans decreased to 66. 3 %, 66. 8 %, 65. 7 %, and 73. 6 %, respectively. The aim of the presented study was the development of a model for measuring possible immunotoxic effects of chemicals, degradation products, xenobiotics and metabolites by these chemicals on the immune system. The method used is an in vitro <b>bacteriolysis</b> of Gram- negative bacterium induced by HEWL, described previously [1 - 4]. In the present study, several halogenated acids, MCA, DCA, and TCA, and the Na salt of 2, 2 -DCPA, exhibited immunosuppressive activity.

In the presence of Triton X- 100, the MICs of oxacillin for both MRSA and MSSA isolates were reduced; this enhancing effect was particularly marked for the MRSA strains. Triton X- 100 therefore counteracted the resistance to methicillin encoded by mecA. In the presence of oxacillin at subinhibitory concentrations, Triton X- 100 induced the <b>bacteriolysis</b> of MRSA and potentiated the autolysis of these organisms. However, the detergent {{had no effect on}} the bacteriolytic enzyme profile or the susceptibility of the bacterial cell wall to bacteriolytic enzymes, nor did it promote the binding of oxacillin to the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2 A. On the other hand, it stimulated the release from the bacteria of acylated lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a putative endogenous regulator of autolysins. Autolytic enzyme-deficient MRSA mutants were equally as sensitive as the parent strain to the effect of Triton X- 100 on susceptibility to oxacillin. These results indicate that the enhanced in-vitro activity of oxacillin against MRSA in the presence of Triton X- 100 cannot be accounted for simply by the induction of <b>bacteriolysis</b> following activation of autolytic enzymes by the detergent-stimulated release of LTA...|$|E

40|$|Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), {{purified}} from gram-negative bacteria, is {{well known}} to induce proinflammatory responses in monocytes and macrophages, and release of LPS from the microbial surface has been suggested {{to be an important}} initiating event in the sepsis syndrome. However, numerous studies have documented that a variety of constituents present in the outer cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria have the capacity to activate cells of the immune system. Given that the majority of immunotherapeutic approaches designed to intervene in gram-negative sepsis have to date targeted the LPS molecule, it would be of value to assess the relative proinflammatory properties of LPS and other gram-negative structures. Experiments were therefore undertaken to assess stimulation of human monocytes by components released from Escherichia coli following <b>bacteriolysis</b> by the cell wall-active antibiotic ceftazidime. As assessed by both induction of procoagulant activity and release of tumor necrosis factor, bacterial culture supernatants contain significant proinflammatory activity. When culture supernatants are fractionated via either velocity sedimentation in sucrose gradients or isopycnic density gradient ultracentrifugation in cesium chloride, the predominant monocyte-stimulating activity is identified in LPS-containing fractions. Further, such activity can be readily abrogated by the addition of polymyxin B.

40|$|Amplification of the Cap b {{locus of}} Haemophilus influenzae occurs {{frequently}} in clinical isolates {{and has been}} proposed to be a mechanism by which this organism evades host defense. To determine if amplification of this locus affected complement fixation, in vitro studies to determine complement-mediated <b>bacteriolysis</b> and complement-mediated opsonization of an isogenic set of organisms containing 2, 3, and 4 copies of the Cap b locus were performed. Organisms containing 4 copies of the Cap b locus were significantly more resistant to antibody-dependent, classical complement pathway-directed <b>bacteriolysis</b> than were organisms containing 2 copies. Organisms containing 3 copies of this locus exhibited intermediate susceptibility to lysis. Complement-mediated opsonization of these organisms was assessed by determining the degree of binding of bacteria to murine or human macrophages or to nonphagocytic cells transfected with the genes for human Mac- 1, the complement receptor type 3. In all three assay systems, organisms containing 4 copies of the Cap b locus bound less well than did organisms containing 2 copies of this locus. Consistent with their decreased susceptibility to lysis and opsonization, organisms with 4 copies of the Cap b locus fixed less C 3 than did organisms containing 2 copies.

Ninety-four percent of clinical isolates express the 2 C 7 -epitope {{which is also a}} vaccine target. Ng expresses multiple LOS(s) due to phase-variation (pv) of LOS glycosyltransferase (lgt) genes. mAb 2 C 7 reactivity requires a lactose extension from the LOS core Heptose (Hep) II (i. e. lgtG ‘ON’ [G+]).

How HepI glycans impact Ng infectivity and mAb 2 C 7 function are unknown and form the bases of this dissertation.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this review {{is to provide a}} {{compilation}} of the complex architectural features of staphylococcal cell walls and of some of their unusual morphogenetic traits including the utilization of murosomes and two different mechanisms of cell separation. Knowledge of these electron microscopic findings may serve as a prerequisite for {{a better understanding of the}} sophisticated events which lead to penicillin-induced death. For more than 50 years there have been controversial disputes about the mechanisms by which penicillin kills bacteria. Many hypotheses have tried to explain this fatal event biochemically and mainly via <b>bacteriolysis.</b> However, indications that penicillin-induced death of staphylococci results from overall biochemical defects or from a fatal attack of bacterial cell walls by bacteriolytic murein hydrolases were not been found. Rather, penicillin, claimed to trigger the activity of murein hydrolases, impaired autolytic wall enzymes of staphylococci. Electron microscopic investigations have meanwhile shown that penicillin-mediated induction of seemingly minute cross wall mistakes is the very reason for this killing. Such “morphogenetic death” taking place at predictable cross wall sites and at a predictable time is based on the initiation of normal cell separations in those staphylococci in which the completion of cross walls had been prevented by local penicillin-mediated impairment of the distribution of newly synthesized peptidoglycan; this death occurs because the high internal pressure of the protoplast abruptly kills such cells via ejection of some cytoplasm during attempted cell separation. An analogous fatal onset of cell partition is considered to take place without involvement of a detectable quantity of autolytic wall enzymes (“mechanical cell separation”). The most prominent feature of penicillin, the disintegration of bacterial cells via <b>bacteriolysis,</b> is shown to represent only a postmortem process resulting from shrinkage of dead cells and perturbation of the cytoplasmic membrane. Several schematic drawings have been included in this review to facilitate an understanding of the complex morphogenetic events...|$|E
40|$|Thirteen {{strains of}} labyrinthulids were {{isolated}} from the coastal area of Kagoshima Bay, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan and from Batan Bay, Panay Island, the Philippines by using diatom double-layer agar plates. The cells of labyrinthulid isolates grew axenically on the bacterial dead cells and extract plus egg yolk agar medium (NSBEY agar). Three representative isolates were demonstrated {{to belong to the}} labyrinthulid phylogenetic group (LPG) based on 18 S rDNA sequence analysis. In the hydrolysis test of labyrinthulid isolates, it was found that they could hydrolyse macromolecular compounds like starch. Ten enzymes were detected by using API-ZYM Kit in four representative isolates. Three enzymes including alkaline phosphatase, leucine arylamidase and valine arylamidase were found in higher level in API-ZYM tests. As examined their bacteriolytic activity, it was found that they could lyse only the dead cells of Gram-negative bacteria and not those of Gram-positive bacteria during incubation in both agar and liquid media. The optimum temperature range for their <b>bacteriolysis</b> was from 25 to 31 °C. Respiratory inhibitors such as sodium cyanide, dinitrophenol and sodium azide had repressed <b>bacteriolysis</b> activity but no impact on viability was found in Labyrinthula cells of a strain 00 –Bat- 05, Philippine isolate. Orange carotenoid pigment(s) was accumulated during stationary growth phase of strain 00 -Bat- 05, cultured in an L-shape tube containing a bacterial dead cell suspension and concomitantly rapid cell movement of developing zoospores was observed. Leucine aminopeptidases (LAPs) from marine labyrinthulid strain 00 -Bat- 05 and thraustochytrid strain HR- 3 cells were partially purified and characterized by enzymological properties. The optimum temperature of LAPs from both strains was 37 °C. The thermostability of 00 -Bat- 05 LAP was indicated by having 80 % of maximum activity after heat treatment at 60 oC for 10 min, while LAP activity of strain HR- 3 was completely inactivated at 60 °C. LAP acvtivities from both strains were high at near pH 8. 0. Both LAPs were inhibited by 1, 10 -phenanthroline, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (PCMB), bestatin and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), suggesting that both are SH-aminopeptidase. Enzyme activity of LAP from strain 00 -Bat- 05 was stimulated by Co 2 + and inhibited by Zn 2 +, while that from HR- 3 was inhibited by Co 2 + and Zn 2 +. LAP of 00 -Bat- 05 had a high specificity for L-leucine-p-nitroanilide but HR- 3 enzyme showed relatively broad specificity for p-nitroanilide derivatives of L-amino acids. Partially purified LAP enzyme, from labyrinthulid sp. strain 00 -Bat- 05, showed the <b>bacteriolysis</b> activity against the dead cells of Vibrio parahaemolyticus which phenomenon was also found by the cells of strain 00 -Bat- 05. 連合農学研究科博士論文(水産学); 学位取得日: 平成 20 年 3 月 14 日博士（水産学）Doctor of Philosophy in Fischeries Science鹿児島大...|$|E
40|$|The lytDl mutant of Escherichia coli {{exhibits}} temperature-sensitive growth {{which is}} attributed to cellular autolysis at the restrictive temperature. Either of two cloned phage k genes, identified as cI and cro, suppressed the lytDl(Ts) lysis phenotype, suggesting that lytD encodes a DNA-binding protein with a DNA-binding specificity {{similar to that of}} CI and Cro. LytD may be a repressor of a gene(s) involved in cellular autolysis. Escherichia coli possesses at least eight enzymes which inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis. We (5) have recently hydrolyze cell wall peptidoglycan (9). The activities of some described a temperature-sensitive mutation in a new E. coli of these peptidoglycan hydrolases may cause <b>bacteriolysis</b> gene, designated lytD, which is associated with peptidogly-under certain circumstances, e. g., during treatment with can hydrolase-mediated lysis at the restrictive temperature cl cr...|$|E
40|$|The RNA phage MS 2 encodes a protein, 75 {{amino acids}} long, that is {{necessary}} and sufficient for lysis of the host cell. DNA deletion analysis {{has shown that the}} lytic activity is confined to the C-terminal half of the protein. We have examined the effects of a synthetic peptide, covering the C-terminal 25 amino acids of the lysis protein, on the electrochemical potential, generated in Escherichia coli membrane vesicles and in liposomes reconstituted with cytochrome c oxidase. In all cases the peptide dissipates the electrochemical potential. The peptide also induces the release of carboxyfluorescein (376 daltons), but not of inuline (5500 daltons), from protein-free liposomes. The phenomena are observed at a lipid to peptide molar ratio of ~ 100 : 1. The possible connection between the dissipation of the proton-motive force and <b>bacteriolysis</b> is discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|The first gene of {{a family}} of prokaryotic proteases with a {{specificity}} for L,D-configured peptide bonds has been identified in Escherichia coli. The gene named ldcA encodes a cytoplasmic L, D-carboxypeptidase, which releases the terminal D-alanine from L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelyl-D-alanine containing turnover products of the cell wall polymer murein. This reaction turned out to be essential for survival, since disruption of the gene results in <b>bacteriolysis</b> during the stationary growth phase. Owing to a defect in muropeptide recycling the unusual murein precursor uridine 5 '-pyrophosphoryl N-acetylmuramyl-tetrapeptide accumulates in the mutant. The dramatic decrease observed in overall cross-linkage of the murein is explained by the increased incorporation of tetrapeptide precursors. They can only function as acceptors and not as donors in the crucial cross-linking reaction. It is concluded that murein recycling is a promising target for novel antibacterial agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{gene for}} a novel endotype membrane-bound lytic transglycosylase, emtA, was mapped at 26. 7 min of the E. coli chromosome. EmtA is a {{lipoprotein}} with an apparent molecular mass of 22 kDa. Overexpression of the emtA gene {{did not result}} in <b>bacteriolysis</b> in vivo, but the enzyme was shown to hydrolyze glycan strands isolated from murein by amidase treatment. The formation of tetra- and hexasaccharides, but no disaccharides, reflects the endospecificity of the enzyme. The products are characterized by the presence of 1, 6 -anhydromuramic acid, indicating a lytic transglycosylase reaction mechanism. EmtA may function as a formatting enzyme that trims the nascent murein strands produced by the murein synthesis machinery into proper sizes, or it may be involved in the formation of tightly controlled minor holes in the murein sacculus to facilitate the export of bulky compounds across the murein barrier...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{viability}} of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exposed to various concentrations {{of a number}} of β-lactam group antibiotics were determined. In S. aureus, the bacteriolytic and bactericidal activity of these drugs was lower at very high drug concentrations than that occurring at low concentrations, but these phenomena were not observed in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Under phase-contrast and scanning electron microscopy, S. aureus treated with high concentrations of β-lactam group antibiotics revealed a lower frequency of <b>bacteriolysis</b> than at low drug concentrations, and similarly by transmission electron microscopy fewer cells were transformed into spheroplasts at high drug concentrations. However, swelling of the cell wall septum was seen in many cells. Spheroplast formation occurred with the highest frequency at drug levels near the minimum inhibitory concentration and became less frequent as drug concentrations were increased...|$|E
