40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} goat <b>breeding</b> and <b>production</b> of <b>slaughter</b> animals. The paper gives {{the characteristics of}} chosen meat and combined goat breeds which are kept both in the Czech Republic and throughout the world and are suitable for slaughter purposes. The next objective was to describe technological systems used in meat goat breeding. The paper discusses various types of housing and necessary requirements {{that have to be}} fulfilled. It describes proper herd management, which includes criteria for choosing breeding animals and goat reproduction. Although the mostly used technique is natural breeding, the thesis also describes insemination. Rut detection and pregnancy diagnosis are very important as well. Pregnancy resulting in birth is a very significant period in goat breeding. The thesis therefore provides a detailed description of birth and after birth treatment. The overview of goat reproduction techniques ends with kid rearing and fattening. The next part of the thesis deals with meat <b>production</b> and <b>slaughter</b> value, and describes composition and quality of goat and kid meat. Finally, the thesis concludes with an overview of the main issues the author of the paper intends to cover in the diploma thesis...|$|R

40|$|Belgrade, as administrative, {{economic}} and cultural centre of Republic of Serbia, covers total area of 3. 224 km 2. From this area, 69, 1 % is agricultural land, which represents fundamental base for establishment of agricultural <b>production.</b> Live stock <b>breeding,</b> on the territory of Belgrade city, {{as well as in}} entire Republic of Serbia, is the most important branch of agriculture. On observed territory animal products’ processing industry (dairies and slaughter houses) especially is developed. Because of that, increment of total live stock <b>breeding</b> <b>production</b> is of great importance for this territory. For growth of live stock breeding competitiveness, in this paper work concrete activities are suggested, such as specialization and increment of production intensity, accomplishment of better financial conditions, selection, accomplishment of better primary agricultural products purchase, etc. In this paper work also are considered and described necessary measures which have to be done by governmental institution, local communities, agro complex companies and family husbandries, with main goal to increase livestock <b>breeding</b> <b>production</b> competitiveness. competitiveness, live stock breeding, Belgrade city, agriculture, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, Community/Rural/Urban Development, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

Final goal of every swine breeding farm is of course to increase reproduction of the animals and ensure healthy progeny. Aim of our research was to {{on the basis of}} detailed microscopic analyse of the ovaries in researched periods and results obtained accelerate reproduction in swine <b>breeding</b> <b>production</b> and by that total flock craft. We have culled 36 sows cross breed of Swedish Landrace and Large White whose are breeded in farm conditions in the periods of estrous and post partum. Immediately after culling we have separated ovaries from surrounding tissue and using micrometer we have measured lenght and width of evident follicles. Obtained results showed that the most ideal period for next mating of sows is 21 to 28 days post partum, when the biggest values of examined parameters had been recorded – lenght and width of follicles, what indicate to increase of ovarial activity...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the parasite Trichostrongylus tenuis and food quality was investigated in red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus, to {{determine the cause of}} variation in population cycles between different areas (Scotland and England). Analysis of long-term data, field experiments and population modelling were carried out. Food quality, in terms of nutrient content of heather, was lower on Scottish grouse moors than on English moors. Parasite burdens were also lower in Scottish grouse populations, than in English grouse populations. A three-way interaction, between food, parasites and area (ScotlandlEngland), acting on <b>breeding</b> <b>production,</b> could explain the variation in population cycle period between areas. However, body condition of grouse was not affected by a food-parasite interaction. Experimental manipulation of food quality and parasite burden did not influence the <b>breeding</b> <b>production</b> of female grouse. Modelling the effects of a food-parasite interaction on grouse populations provided evidence that such an interaction could explain variation in cycle period between areas, although other factors are likely to be important in some cases. Red grouse are not unique, as other species also have cycles driven by food and parasites. Other species do not show cyclic population fluctuations because of having shared parasites, and a strong immune response. There is a specialist predator-prey relationship between red grouse and T. tenuis...|$|R

40|$|A systems {{model was}} {{estimated}} {{to determine the effects}} of declining U. S. retail beef demand on farm-level beef prices and production. Retail beef demand declined by nearly 66 % from 1976 to 1999. Results indicate autonomous shifts in retail demand significantly impacted farm-level demands and production. Based on equilibrium multipliers, the 1976 – 99 reduction in beef demand decreased real slaughter cattle prices and production by 32. 1 % and 11. 2 %, respectively. Real feeder cattle prices and production decreased by 8. 0 % and 22. 6 %, respectively. Combining the decreases in farm prices and <b>production,</b> <b>slaughter</b> and feeder cattle producers experienced a real revenue reduction of $ 13. 3 billion (61 %) due to the long-term decline in demand.
