5|$|Some {{instruments}} {{fall into}} more than one category: for example, the cello may be considered tenor, <b>baritone</b> or bass, depending on how its music fits into the ensemble, and the trombone may be alto, tenor, <b>baritone,</b> or bass and the French horn, bass, <b>baritone,</b> tenor, or alto, depending on the range it is played in. Many instruments have their range {{as part of their}} name: soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, <b>baritone</b> horn, alto flute, bass guitar, etc. Additional adjectives describe instruments above the soprano range or below the bass, for example: sopranino saxophone, contrabass clarinet. When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the instrument's range in comparison to other instruments of its family and not in comparison to the human voice range or instruments of other families. For example, a bass flute's range is from C3 to F♯6, while a bass clarinet plays about one octave lower.|$|E

5|$|Bryars {{chose to}} {{distinguish}} the character types through the vocal ranges they were given. The adults of the town are largely given deep voices, bass and bass-baritone for the men, contralto and mezzo-soprano for the women. The lovers have high voices, soprano and counter-tenor. In {{order to make the}} scientists sound unlike the townspeople, Bryars made Ox a tenor and Ygène a <b>baritone,</b> both parts being agile, lyric and relatively high in their voice range.|$|E
5|$|For the 1893 version a <b>baritone</b> solo, two bassoons, four {{horns and}} two {{trumpets}} {{are added to}} the original scoring.
