Exact solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations for out-of-plane orientations of the easy axes {{that correspond to}} inhomogeneous conical structures of CLC director are derived. We study dependence of the CLC twist wavenumber on the free twisting number assuming that anchoring energies at the substrates are either equal or different. In both cases this dependence {{is found to be}} generally discontinuous with hysteresis loops and <b>bistability</b> <b>effects</b> involved. For CLC cells with identical substrates and planar anchoring conditions the jump-like behaviour only disappears in the weak anchoring limit. Contrastingly, when the anchoring strengths are different, there is the finite value of anchoring below which the dependence becomes continuous.

40|$|Today’s lithographic {{techniques}} for carving silicon into circuit patterns {{are unable to}} achieve the future target of the semiconductor industry of fabricating ultrahigh density memory devices made of memory cells just few tens of nanometers apart. Methods of extending these approaches to large-scale, high-density circuitry are largely undeveloped. Between emerging self-assembly bottom-up methods for advanced fabrication of electronic devices based on organic matrices, nanocomposites formed by a conducting phase (e. g. metal nanoparticles) dispersed in a polymeric matrix have attracted considerable attention, because these materials might {{be used as an}} active layer in almost all kinds of organic electronic devices. In this paper a different approach for the fabrication of advanced electronic devices is suggested, based on the combination of two concepts: the use of organic materials as active layers that guarantees simplified manufacturing process yielding low-cost, flexible, and light-weight devices, and the use of self-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) that allows building nanostructures from the bottom up using individual macromolecules. The ordered cylindrical self-assembled nanostructure formed from PS- b -PMMA is used as host for selectively sequestering gold nanoparticles. The ordered distribution of the functional particles is guided by the ordering of the host matrix and allows arising other numerous possible applications that depend on the nanospecific properties of the sequestered components and the intrinsic flexibility of the polymeric matrix. The BCP structure has many considerable advantages in terms of low material consumptions and reduced operating voltages for producing high <b>bistability</b> <b>effects</b> in well ordered nanostructures. Moreover, the excellent results we achieved in terms of electronic performances and the high potential opened by this nanotechnology toward the development of innovative materials open the way toward the realization of novel organic devices containing different physical types of functionalized nanoparticles (e. g. oxides, superconductors, etc.), and the investigation of their fundamental properties...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of nonlinear materials in photonic crystals and periodic optical media in general {{has been extensively}} investigated in literature but currently numerical simulation, which is necessary {{in the design of}} sophisticated photonics devices, is very challenging. The Split-Field Finite-Difference Time-Domain (SF- FDTD) approach is a formulation of FDTD that is specially tailored to efficiently incorporate the periodicity in the algorithm and provides a natural framework for simulating periodic optical media under oblique angle of incidence. Here, this formalism has been adapted for covering second- and third- order nonlinear materials with a tensorial formulation of both nonlinear susceptibilities. Even the method only considers a single period of the structure, the addition of nonlinear materials sets some issues that must be addressed. Firstly, the nonlinear dependence of the electromagnetic field, which is included due to the nonlinear polarization term, must be solved in each time step by means of an additional fixed-point iterative process. Hence, the computational intensity of the method is dramatically affected. Secondly, considering the tensorial behaviour of the second and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities establishes a challenge in terms of computational resources. In order to avoid these drawbacks, High- Performance Computing (HPC) solutions based on GPU and Intel Xeon Phi have been considered. The SF-FDTD method here presented gives the possibility of accurately analyse phenomena such as the second harmonic generation in second-order nonlinear materials, shifting of resonances in resonant gratings due to Kerr <b>effect,</b> <b>bistability</b> <b>effects</b> and all- optical behaviour in two-dimensionally binary gratings with nonlinear material filling the pillars.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} resonant tunneling through impurity states with large binding {{energy of the}} GaAs/AlAs double-barrier resonant tunneling heterostructure. These states originate due to the penetration of Si impurity atoms from the heavily doped emitter layer that is adjacent {{to one of the}} two AlAs layers. Magnetotunneling transport results demonstrate that resonant peaks and steps arise due to tunneling through the X-valley-related donor states localized in an AlAs layer. The strong asymmetry of the doping profile in our structures provides substantial accumulation of the resonant electrons at one bias polarity, which gives rise to the intrinsic bistability observed for the impurity-assisted resonant tunneling. Using perturbation theory, we estimated the value of the current and tunneling rates through the X-valley-related donor states, which is in good agreement with the measured current value and the registered <b>bistability</b> <b>effect.</b> Observed Zeeman splitting of the current peak allowed us to determine the value of the g factor of the confined impurity states...|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} <b>bistability</b> <b>effect</b> in a {{dimensionally}} scaled semiconductor nanostruncture {{consisting of a}} diluted magnetic semiconductor quantum dot (QD) and a reservoir of itinerant holes separated by a barrier. The bistability stems from the magnetic phase transition in the QD mediated by {{the changes in the}} hole population.

Subsequently, the parameter window suitable for this bistability formation is discussed along with the the conditions for the maximum robustness/non-volatility. To examine the issue of scaling, an estimation of the bistabiity lifetime is made by considering the thermal fluctuation in the QD hole population via the spontaneous transitions.

A detailed series of experimental and theoretical characterizations have been performed to understand the electrical properties of the RTDs (without embedding any QDs) and QD-embedded RTDs (QDRTDs).
