60|$|The {{assembly}} {{was taken}} wholly by surprise at this announcement. Alan, duke of Brittany, {{who was one}} of the chief claimants to the succession, was pleased with the honor conferred upon him in making him at once the governor of the realm, and was inclined to prefer the present certainty of governing at once in the name of others, to the remote contingency of reigning in his own. The other claimants to the inheritance were confounded by the suddenness of the emergency, and knew not what to say or do. The rest of the assembly were pleased with the romance of having the beautiful boy for their feudal sovereign. The duke saw at once that every thing was favorable to the accomplishment of his design. He took the lad in his arms, kissed him, and held him out in view of the assembly. William gazed around upon the panoplied warriors before him with a bright and beaming eye. They knelt down as <b>by</b> a <b>common</b> <b>accord</b> to do him homage, and then took the oath of perpetual allegiance and fidelity to his cause.|$|R

40|$|AbstractMulti-sensor image {{matching}} {{based on}} salient edges has broad prospect in applications, {{but it is}} difficult to extract salient edges of real multi-sensor images with noises fast and accurately <b>by</b> using <b>common</b> algorithms. <b>According</b> to the analysis of the features of salient edges, a novel salient edges detection algorithm and its rapid calculation are proposed based on possibility fuzzy C-means (PFCM) kernel clustering using two-dimensional vectors composed of the values of gray and texture. PFCM clustering can overcome the shortcomings that fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering is sensitive to noises and possibility C-means (PCM) clustering tends to find identical clusters. On this basis, a method is proposed to improve real-time performance by compressing data sets based on the idea of data reduction in the field of mathematical analysis. In addition, the idea that kernel-space is linearly separable is used to enhance robustness further. Experimental results show that this method extracts salient edges for real multi-sensor images with noises more accurately than the algorithm based on force fields and the FCM algorithm; and the proposed method is on average about 56 times faster than the PFCM algorithm in real time and has better robustness...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{there is}} a {{tendency}} in the EU to adjust the minimum-capital requirement. In France and Germany the requirement for private limited liabilities has been totally abolished, whilst other countries have chosen to reduce their requirement. The Swedish law concerning the minimum-capital requirement is from 1 st of April 2010 being lowered to 50   000 SEK. In common law jurisdictions such as United Kingdom and USA a minimum-capital requirement does not exist. The european main argument to keep such a requirement is that it accomplishes a creditor protection. This theory does not concur with the one argued <b>by</b> <b>common</b> law-jurisdictions, <b>according</b> to their legal systems the protection is nothing but illusionary. By examining former national law in contrast to current, the writer wishes to detect differences or similarities regarding the motives to the existing bodies of law. This thesis wishes to find out whether European law stands on the same fundamental corporate law principals as common law-jurisdictions do. This thesis also intends to investigate the cause for the Swedish decision to keep the capital requirement. The conclusions drawn in this study state that European motives to abolish the minimum-capital requirement differ from those of the UK and USA. Europeans removing this requirement is not an action made out of the acknowledgement that a legally required capital is unnecessary, it simply has been to this point, the will to attract corporations and {{to keep up with the}} development. The Swedish government chose to keep the requirement claiming creditors protection as the reason for this. The author is of the opinion that the arguments presented to support this are illegitimate, and derive from ignorance. An ignorance either caused by tradition and a conservative fear of the unconventional, or simply by a lack of skills. Let us hope the reason isn’t lack of skills for the sake of our legal security...|$|R

60|$|My Lord Howe {{was heard}} {{to speak in}} special praise of Mr. Warrington, and so he had a {{handsome}} share of the fashion and favour which the town now bestowed on the volunteers. Doubtless {{there were thousands of}} men employed who were as good as they but the English ever love their gentlemen, and love that they should distinguish themselves; and these volunteers were voted Paladins and heroes <b>by</b> <b>common</b> <b>accord.</b> As our young noblemen will, they accepted their popularity very affably. White's and Almack's illuminated when they returned, and St. James's embraced its young knights. Harry was restored to full favour amongst them. Their hands were held out eagerly to him again. Even his relations congratulated him; and there came a letter from Castlewood, whither Aunt Bernstein had by this time betaken herself, containing praises of his valour, and a pretty little bank-bill, as a token of his affectionate aunt's approbation. This was under my Lord Castlewood's frank, who sent his regards to both his kinsmen, and an offer of the hospitality of his country-house, if they were minded to come to him. And besides this, there came to him a private letter through the post--not very well spelt, but in a handwriting which Harry smiled to see again, in which his affeetionate cousin, Maria Esmond, told him she always loved to hear his praises (which were in everybody's mouth now), and sympathised in his good or evil fortune; and that, whatever occurred to him, she begged to keep a little place in his heart. Parson Sampson, she wrote, had preached a beautiful sermon about the horrors of war, and the noble actions of men who volunteered to face battle and danger in the service of their country. Indeed, the chaplain wrote himself, presently, a letter full of enthusiasm, in which he saluted Mr. Harry as his friend, his benefactor, his glorious hero. Even Sir Miles Warrington despatched a basket of game from Norfolk: and one bird (shot sitting), with love to my cousin, had a string and paper round the leg, and was sent as the first victim of young Miles's fowling-piece.|$|E
6000|$|In the Berlin Act, {{the three}} Powers recognise, on the threshold, [...] "the {{independence}} of the Samoan government, and the free right of the natives to elect their chief or king and choose their form of government." [...] True, the text continues that, [...] "in view of the difficulties that surround an election in the present disordered condition of the government," [...] Malietoa Laupepa shall be recognised as king, [...] "unless the three Powers shall <b>by</b> <b>common</b> <b>accord</b> otherwise declare." [...] But perhaps few natives have followed it so far, and even those who have, were possibly all cast abroad again by the next clause: [...] "and his successor shall be duly elected according to the laws and customs of Samoa." [...] The right to elect, freely given in one sentence, was suspended in the next, and a line or so further on appeared to be reconveyed by a side-wind. The reason offered for suspension was ludicrously false; in May 1889, when Sir Edward Malet moved the matter in the conference, the election of Mataafa was not only certain to have been peaceful, {{it could not have}} been opposed; and behind the English puppet it was easy to suspect the hand of Germany. No one is more swift to smell trickery than a Samoan; and the thought, that, under the long, bland, benevolent sentences of the Berlin Act, some trickery lay lurking, filled him with the breath of opposition. Laupepa seems never to have been a popular king. Mataafa, on the other hand, holds an unrivalled position in the eyes of his fellow-countrymen; he was the hero of the war, he had lain with them in the bush, he had borne the heat and burthen of the day; they began to claim that he should enjoy more largely the fruits of victory; his exclusion was believed to be a stroke of German vengeance, his elevation to the kingship was looked for as the fitting crown and copestone of the Samoan triumph; and but a little after the coming of the chief justice, an ominous cry for Mataafa began to arise in the islands. It is difficult to see what that official could have done but what he did. He was loyal, as in duty bound, to the treaty and to Laupepa; and when the orators of the important and unruly islet of Manono demanded to his face a change of kings, {{he had no choice but}} to refuse them, and (his reproof being unheeded) to suspend the meeting. Whether by any neglect of his own or the mere force of circumstance, he failed, however, to secure the sympathy, failed even to gain the confidence, of Mataafa. The latter is not without a sense of his own abilities or of the great service he has rendered to his native land. He felt himself neglected; at the very moment when the cry for his elevation rang throughout the group he thought himself made little of on Mulinuu; and he began to weary of his part. In this humour, he was exposed to a temptation which I must try to explain, as best I may be able, to Europeans.|$|E
