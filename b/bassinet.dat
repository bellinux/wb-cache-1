2500|$|This is an unverifiable drug-scare story {{dating to}} the 1960s of a hippie {{babysitter}} girl putting a baby {{in the oven and}} a turkey in the <b>bassinet.</b> It has been debunked by Snopes.com. This myth is parodied in The Simpsons episode [...] "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson," [...] in which the children go on a school field trip to a [...] "scared straight" [...] wax museum at the local police station. One exhibit contains a wax dummy of a hippie woman eating a sandwich with a baby in it. Chief Wiggum says [...] "That's right, she's got the munchies for a California Cheeseburger!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In his own lifetime, the salacious {{details of}} Gesualdo's killing {{of his first}} wife and her lover were widely publicized, {{including}} in verse by poets such as Tasso and an entire flock of Neapolitan poets, eager {{to capitalize on the}} sensation. The accounts of his cruelty were expanded with apocryphal stories such as the alleged killing of an illegitimate child of Donna Maria and her lover, which according to one variant of the made-up story was [...] "suspended in a <b>bassinet</b> and swung to the point of death". Until the 1620s his music was imitated by Neapolitan composers of polyphonic madrigals such as Antonio Cifra, Michelangelo Rossi, Giovanni de Macque, Scipione Dentice, Girolamo Frescobaldi and Sigismondo d'India.|$|E
2500|$|The bascinet – also <b>bassinet,</b> basinet, or bazineto– was a Medieval European open-faced {{military}} helmet. It {{evolved from}} a type of iron or steel skullcap, but had a more pointed apex to the skull, and it extended downwards at the rear and sides to afford protection for the neck. A mail curtain ("camail" [...] or aventail) was usually attached to the lower edge of the helmet to protect the throat, neck and shoulders. A visor (face guard) was often employed from ca. 1330 to protect the exposed face. Early in the fifteenth century, the camail began {{to be replaced by}} a plate metal gorget, giving rise to the so-called [...] "great bascinet".|$|E

60|$|Manny's choleric {{face had}} turned darker as he {{observed}} the mischance of his representative. He beckoned {{now to a}} tall knight, whose gaunt and savage face looked out from his open <b>bassinet</b> as an eagle might from a cage of steel.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is nothing, my fair lord," [...] said Alleyne, who had now {{loosened}} his <b>bassinet,</b> {{which was}} cracked across by the Norman's blow. Even as he spoke, however, his head swirled round, {{and he fell}} to the deck with the blood gushing from his nose and mouth.|$|E

6000|$|... "How is that, my fair sir?" [...] {{cried the}} armorer {{as he drew}} the <b>bassinet</b> over the head and {{fastened}} it to the camail which extended to the shoulders. [...] "I swear by Tubal Cain that it fits you as the shell fits the crab! A finer suit never came from Italy or Spain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By his armor, sire, {{which is}} rounder at elbow and at {{shoulder}} {{than any of}} Bordeaux or of England. Italian he might be were his <b>bassinet</b> more sloped, but I will swear that those plates were welded betwixt this and Rhine. Here comes his squire, however, and we shall hear what strange fortune hath brought him over the marches." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a corner!" [...] she exclaimed, [...] "why, {{is there}} not the whole parlour? Do you suppose that a baby {{requires}} a four-post bed, and a wash-hand-stand, and a five-foot mirror? Couldn't we lift the poor darling in and out in half a minute? Besides, there is our own room. I feel {{as if there was}} an uncomfortable want of some sort ever since our baby was transplanted to the nursery. So we will establish the old <b>bassinet</b> and put the mite there." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 1958: Construction {{completed}} of new hospital {{facility at}} 17th St. and Western Avenue. This {{was the first}} air-conditioned hospital in the city, with 133 beds, 30 <b>bassinets,</b> and 275 employees.|$|R

60|$|The girl sat {{motionless}} and wide-eyed at {{the side}} of the road watching every move of the two contestants. She made no effort to escape, but seemed riveted to the spot by the very fierceness of the battle she was beholding, as well, possibly, as by the fascination of the handsome giant who had espoused her cause. As she looked upon her champion, she saw a lithe, muscular, brown-haired youth whose clear eyes and perfect figure, unconcealed by either <b>bassinet</b> or hauberk, reflected the clean, athletic life of the trained fighting man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, nay, {{your head}} I {{can see is}} still totty, and i' faith little head would you have, had your <b>bassinet</b> not stood your friend. All that may be done is already carried out, for we have stuffed the gape with sails and corded it without and within. Yet when we bale our bowline and veer the sheet our lives will hang upon the breach {{remaining}} blocked. See how yonder headland looms upon us through the mist! We must tack within three arrow flights, or we may find a rock through our timbers. Now, St. Christopher be praised! here is Sir Nigel, with whom I may confer." ...|$|E
60|$|The three vessels {{had been}} {{sweeping}} swiftly westwards, the cog still {{well to the}} front, although the galleys were slowly drawing in upon either quarter. To the left was a hard skyline unbroken by a sail. The island already lay like a cloud behind them, while right in front was St. Alban's Head, with Portland looming mistily in the farthest distance. Alleyne stood by the tiller, looking backwards, the fresh wind full in his teeth, the crisp winter air tingling {{on his face and}} blowing his yellow curls from under his <b>bassinet.</b> His cheeks were flushed and his eyes shining, for the blood of a hundred fighting Saxon ancestors was beginning to stir in his veins.|$|E
5000|$|Protection {{from cold}} temperature, infection, noise, drafts and excess handling: Incubators may be {{described}} as <b>bassinets</b> enclosed in plastic, with climate control equipment designed to keep them warm and limit their exposure to germs.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>bassinets</b> are {{designed}} to rock or swing freely, with many carers finding their child calmed by this action. The process of lulling the child to sleep may be accompanied by prerecorded or live performance of lullabies.|$|R
5000|$|Milton District Hospital- Opened in 1959 with 53 {{beds and}} 8 <b>bassinets.</b> The Emergency Department, open 24 hours a day, {{seven days a}} week, {{together}} with the outpatient department provides care to more than 37,000 patients annually.|$|R
6000|$|... "By my hilt!" [...] said Aylward, [...] "if I am {{to preach}} on bowmanship, the whole long day would scarce give me {{time for my}} sermon. We have marksmen in the Company who will notch with a shaft every crevice and joint of a man-at-arm's harness, from the clasp of his <b>bassinet</b> to the hinge of his greave. But, with your favor, friend, I must gather my arrows again, for while a shaft costs a penny a poor man can scarce leave them {{sticking}} in wayside stumps. We must, then, on our road again, and I hope from my heart that you may train these two young goshawks here until they are ready for a cast even at such a quarry as you speak of." ...|$|E
60|$|When Sir Charles Grandison {{stepped up}} and made his very beautifullest bow to Miss Byron, I am sure his gracious dignity never {{exceeded}} that of Colonel Newcome's first greeting to Mrs. Pendennis. Of course from the very moment they beheld one another they became friends. Are not most of our likings thus instantaneous? Before she came down to see him, Laura had put {{on one of the}} Colonel's shawls--the crimson one, with the red palm-leaves and the border of many colours. As for the white one, the priceless, the gossamer, the fairy web, which might pass through a ring, that, every lady must be aware, was already appropriated to cover the cradle, or what I believe is called the <b>bassinet,</b> of Master Pendennis.|$|E
6000|$|... "One garment was {{all that}} Norman of Torn would permit him, and {{as the sun was}} hot overhead, he {{selected}} for the Bishop a <b>bassinet</b> for that single article of apparel, to protect his tonsured pate from the rays of old sol. Then, fearing that it might be stolen from him by some vandals of the road, he had One Eye Kanty rivet it at each side of the gorget so that it could not be removed by other than a smithy, and thus, strapped face to tail upon a donkey, he sent the great Bishop of Norwich rattling down the dusty road with his head, at least, protected from the idle gaze of whomsoever he might chance to meet. Forty stripes he gave to each of the Bishop's retinue for being abroad in bad company; but come, here we are where you shall have the wine as proof of my tale." ...|$|E

2500|$|Malaysia Airlines {{subsequently}} {{claimed that}} an upgrade of the First Class cabin to fit new seats and an ottoman (which {{doubles as a}} visitor seat) meant [...] "there was no facility for positioning <b>bassinets</b> in the First Class of the 747s." ...|$|R
50|$|Plans {{for a new}} {{hospital}} in Upper Darby, PA were drawn in 1925 and the Delaware County Hospital was chartered. It {{opened to the public}} on July 1, 1927, with 56 beds and 11 <b>bassinets.</b> The hospital was renamed Delaware County Memorial Hospital in 1959.|$|R
60|$|The Company had {{marched to}} {{the turn of the}} road ere Sir Nigel Loring rode out from the gateway, mounted on Pommers, his great black war-horse, whose {{ponderous}} footfall on the wooden drawbridge echoed loudly from the gloomy arch which spanned it. Sir Nigel was still in his velvet dress of peace, with flat velvet cap of maintenance, and curling ostrich feather clasped in a golden brooch. To his three squires riding behind him it looked as though he bore the bird's egg as well as its feather, for the back of his bald pate shone like a globe of ivory. He bore no arms save the long and heavy sword which hung at his saddle-bow; but Terlake carried in front of him the high wivern-crested <b>bassinet,</b> Ford the heavy ash spear with swallow-tail pennon, while Alleyne was entrusted with the emblazoned shield. The Lady Loring rode her palfrey at her lord's bridle-arm, for she would see him as far as the edge of the forest, and ever and anon she turned her hard-lined face up wistfully to him and ran a questioning eye over his apparel and appointments.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bassinet</b> travel cot: A <b>bassinet</b> travel cot is a {{standard}} travel cot with a <b>bassinet</b> included for a smaller baby. Much like the pop-up travel cot, the <b>bassinet</b> is smaller and softer, and is designed for new babies, however when the baby can support himself {{on his hands and}} feet, parents can remove the <b>bassinet</b> and use the travel cot as they would {{a standard}} travel cot, without having to buy a new travel cot. <b>Bassinet</b> travel cots can come with added extras including a vibrating mattress, lights and music, which are intended to support the baby in its efforts to sleep.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bassinet</b> usage in the United States {{nearly doubled}} to 20% from 1992-2006. Greater than 45% of babies {{up to two}} months used a <b>bassinet.</b> By 5-6 months, however, fewer than 10% of babies sleep in bassinets. In a {{hospital}} environment, a special form of sealed <b>bassinet</b> is used in a neonatal intensive care unit.|$|E
50|$|Upon opening, the {{hospital}} had 92 beds and 40 <b>bassinets.</b> In March 1956, the road leading to {{the hospital}} was blacktopped and during the summer, a new highway, U.S. 23, was laid, thus reducing by about one-third the distance from Ashland to the hospital.|$|R
