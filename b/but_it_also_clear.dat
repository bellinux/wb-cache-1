40|$|Today, the use {{and manage}} of {{information}} and communication technologies (ICT) within the global competitive environments, is evident and essential for the competitiveness empowerment of companies at world class levels. It has been observed, that the simple use of ICT as a tool of administrative support, do not guarantee high levels of competitiveness, neither the creation of exceptional value for the main economic players of developing countries. In order to be a real differentiation enabler for the organizations, it is necessary to concentrate its use in the core business capabilities and in its articulation with the external conditions of his regional environments. This work has two fundamentals objectives; fi rst, to identify how the ICT are used to support the operation of most Latin American companies, and to propose possible alternatives to achieve highest levels of impact of the current regional competitiveness. It is clear that the existing digital development gap have affected not only the level of electronic readiness that the region requires to support the current operation of the companies, or the improvement of their levels of productivity, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> how the digital technologies affect remarkably the competitiveness and the economic development of companies that are not ready to resist the impacts of the world class players. In this work we emphasized the necessity to redesign the Latin American companies through the change of the old paradigms of management, operations and competition, by new organizational structures, new business models better adapted to the modern schemes of businesses and industrial conditions. Globalization is a fact. It exists already, and companies require better strategic practices to be successful in the current complex economic models, as well as new strategies to compete in changing environments...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the great}} {{challenges}} of presenting and discussing my work {{over the last several}} years has been pulling the conversation back from technical, practical, logistical issues and regaining a focus on aesthetic, artistic, musical ones. I am aware, of course, that it is in many ways the notation – and the unusual performance techniques and approaches to instruments/voices that made the development of that notation necessary – that gives the works their identity, or at least, on the surface, gives them their uniqueness. <b>But</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> to me that this focus on the practical, factual aspects of the work is far too easy (it reminds me in many ways of the analyses of early 20 th century repertoire that I had to do as an undergraduate in which we were identifying pitch sets or serial row transformations without ever actually engaging with sound in any real way, much less wider cultural or social contexts), and it risks turning the notation and the performance techniques into a kind of gimmick, a shtick, or, as I am increasingly discovering, a ‘brand’...|$|R

Many of these emigrants subsequently relocated to the Fox River Settlement in LaSalle County, Illinois. By most accounts, the first minister at Fox River was a layman by the name of Ole Olsen Hetletvedt (1797- 1854), a Haugean in leaning. He was one of the early Norwegian settlers who had crossed the Atlantic Ocean in 1825 on board the Restauration.|$|R

40|$|This article pays {{tribute to}} the {{tremendous}} achievements of Dr. László Rosivall in renal (patho) physiology research and nephrology education in Hungary {{on the occasion of}} his 60 th birthday. For the past several decades Dr. Rosivall has been a charismatic leader of academic institutions, national and international societies, foundations in physiology, nephrology and hypertension, but the most important of his many contributions, is his role as a scientist. He earned his MD with Summa cum Laude at Semmelweis University (1973) and was invited immediately after that to join the laboratory of Hársing. He studied the distribution of intra-renal blood flow employing then state-of-the-art methods as well as developed his own technique at Semmelweis University and at the University of Bergen with Knut Aukland. This led to his PhD thesis and degree in 1980. An important determinant of his early basic scientific training and development was his postdoctoral research fellowship and later many visiting professorships in the Nephrology Research and Training Center (NRTC) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA between 1981 and 1983. Actually, this research fellowship not only impacted his own future career, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>cleared</b> the path for many other young Hungarian scientists who later trained with Dr. Rosivall and then at UAB. The early 1980 s were the years of significant scientific discoveries and the NRTC team at UAB made important contributions by their studies on renal and glomerular hemodynamics, the renin-angiotensin system (12, 19, 22) and by the development of classic experimental techniques like renal micropuncture, microperfusion, and the juxtamedullary nephron preparation (3) that are still being used worldwide. When Dr. Rosivall joined UAB in the 1980 s, the team at the NRTC included Drs. Navar, Bell, Inscho, Carmines, Casellas, and Oparil, among many others, who share their fond memories of working with Dr. Rosivall in this article...|$|R
