25|$|The Speaker must {{be elected}} when Parliament first meets after any general election, before it {{proceeds}} {{to deal with}} any other business. Similarly, whenever the office of Speaker is vacant for some reason other than a dissolution of Parliament, no business must be transacted other than {{the election of a}} person to fill that office. The Speaker may be elected from among the MPs who are not Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> person who is not an MP can be chosen. Nonetheless, a candidate who is not an MP must possess the qualifications to stand for election as an MP. The Speaker's salary may not be reduced while he is in office.|$|E

25|$|In a European {{cooperation}} project between 2008 and 2012 in comparison 4 hospital {{waste water treatment}} facilities were developed in Switzerland, Germany, The Netherlands and Luxembourg to investigate the elimination rates of concentrated waste water with pharmaceutical “cocktails” by using different and combined advanced treatment technologies. Especially the German STP at Marienhospital Gelsenkirchen showed {{the effects of a}} combination of membranes, ozone, powdered activated carbon and sand filtration. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> maximum of installed technologies could not eliminate 100% of all substances and especially radiocontrast agents are nearly impossible to eliminate. The investigations showed that depending on the installed technologies the treatment costs for such a hospital treatment facility may be up to 5.50 € per m2. Other studies and comparisons expect the treatment costs to increase up to 10%, mainly due to energy demand.|$|E
25|$|On 26 June 1840, the San Jacinto sailed from Galveston with {{instructions}} to blockade the Mexican port of Veracruz and seize enemy ships. On 20 August, the San Jacinto rejoined Commodore Edwin W. Moore's flotilla and remained with them until being detached to Galveston with dispatches for the government. In search of drinking water, the San Jacinto called at Cayos Arcas. A violent cold front approached but Lt. O'Shaunessy nevertheless went ashore, leaving Lt. Alfred G. Gray as senior officer on board. When the ship's anchor failed to hold, Gray displayed great ingenuity and seamanship {{in an attempt}} to save it, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> piece of the ship's artillery used as an additional anchor could not save the San Jacinto from being swept ashore by gale winds.|$|E
25|$|In a {{game that}} was full of big plays, Iowa did just enough to win on Homecoming weekend. Iowa scored three times on special teams, once on a blocked field goal, once on a blocked punt and once on a 51-yard Nate Kaeding field goal. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> 95-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Brad Banks to Dallas Clark wasn't {{enough to keep the}} Boilermakers from making a comeback. Scoring on two rushing touchdowns in the 4th quarter, Purdue quickly turned a 10-point deficit into a four-point lead. And after Banks was sacked on 4th down with only 2:44 remaining, it seemed as if Purdue would escape with the victory. But the Boilermakers could do nothing with their three downs and had to punt the ball away. Banks wasted no time, running for a 44-yard gain to the Purdue 43 on the first play of the drive. Later, on 4th down from the Purdue seven-yard line, Banks connected with Clark once again, this time for the game-winning touchdown. Purdue had one last chance, but a late interception by Adolphus Shelton secured the Iowa victory.|$|E

For tulip mania to have qualified as an economic bubble, the price of tulip bulbs would need to have become unhinged from the intrinsic value of the bulbs.

Four minutes after the Aloneftis found near the rollover, but failed to score. Anorthosis but had not said the last word.
