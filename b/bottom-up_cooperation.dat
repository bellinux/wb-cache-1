40|$|Inter-municipal {{cooperation}} mechanisms {{have been}} promoted as flexible tools, reflecting {{the transition from}} government to governance in a new network economy and eliminating the need to engage in redrawing clear-cut boundaries {{in the context of}} soft spaces with fuzzy boundaries. An evaluation of inter-municipal cooperation in the development of industrial parks and tax revenue redistribution in Israel, from the first 1992 initiative to imposed redistribution in 2014 / 15, reveals how an initiative ’from below’ has been adopted and encouraged ’from above’, finally used by the central state as a tool of control, to serve its own objectives. It highlights the inherent temptation for top- down imposition, embedded in <b>bottom-up</b> <b>cooperation</b> mechanisms, calling for light-touch regulatory legislation and opting for gently imposed solutions where needed...|$|E
40|$|While best {{practice}} in water management typically {{calls for the}} use of a basin-level approach, specific guidance in the absence of basin-level management is fairly scant. This paper reviews the experience of the Syr Darya basin to identify insights related to second {{best practice}}s for water management at scales below the basin level. This paper first presents the causes for the disintegration of river basin management within the Syr Darya, which include both changes in operation of the Toktogul reservoir and rising water demands due to shifts in agricultural production and land ownership. Focus is then devoted specifically to small transboundary tributaries, where <b>bottom-up</b> <b>cooperation</b> has continued or reemerged in recent times. This paper concludes by highlighting the limitations to singular focus on sub-basins and tributaries, suggesting a balance between more intense cooperation and water control on tributaries and a loose overarching framework at the basin level...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{cross-border cooperation}} {{in a broader}} European context, looking in particular at {{the experiences of the}} Szczecin region {{since the end of the}} communist rule in 1990. Political reform allowed local and regional governments to create direct linkages with regions in neighbouring countries, as well as with regions further afield. However, as well as administrative and geographical factors, historic and political factors can play a role in the development of cross-border relations and the ability of a city or region to fulfil its broader locational potential. This is particularly true in the case of Szczecin, which, as the city of Stettin, was part of Germany until 1945. After becoming part of Poland, it turned its back on that part of its former hinterland in Germany, and rather than being orientated towards Berlin and the West bank of the Oder, it became oriented towards Warsaw. After 1990, Berlin and Mecklenburg-Vorpommen in Germany favoured closer economic and political collaboration, both to promote development on their territories and to restore the region's relative centrality within Central Europe. However, the Polish government is far more centralised than the German one, and cross-border cooperation was straitened because of this. In addition, local and national politics also influenced the strength and breadth of cooperation. Despite this, cooperation between Szczecin and the neighbouring German regions has grown and continues to grow, both formally, through joint agreements, and plans, and informally through <b>bottom-up</b> <b>cooperation,</b> such as cross-border migration in search of housing, cross-border trade in goods and services and more recently, the development of Szczecin as a low-cost flight destination. Such cooperation has been enhanced by Szczecin's participation in broader European networks. Additional national actors have to some extent removed some of the political sensibility attached to cooperation with Germany alone...|$|E

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to ongoing debates on how <b>bottom-up</b> social <b>cooperation</b> can halt and reverse processes {{of environmental and}} human degradation, dispossession and impoverishment, by proposing a synchronization of resistance and of commoning practices. The article moves from the empirical case of social and ecological conflicts currently unfolding in the so-called Land of Fires, an area in Southern Italy infamous for the socio-environmental impacts of two decades of waste disposal, mismanagement and contamination. Within this context, a coalition of grassroots movements is struggling to resist livelihoods degradation through an alliance with anti-Mafia social cooperatives. We provide an in-depth analysis of emerging social and economic networks that connect the strategies of grassroots movements for environmental justice {{with the work of}} social cooperatives that reclaim lands and assets confiscated to Mafia. The interests of environmental activists meet the interests of social cooperatives at the crossroad of territory reclamation with the spheres of social and economic production and reproduction. Framing the case as a cultural and physical re-appropriation of territory, we provide an analysis of strategies and limits for a symbolic and practical project of social re-appropriation of the commons (De Angelis 2012) ...|$|R
5000|$|Up to now, Eurasian {{integration}} has primarily {{developed from}} the <b>bottom-up,</b> as intergovernmental <b>cooperation</b> is lagging behind the development of economic linkages. Vinokurov argues that cooperation in Eurasia should not (and could not) encompass all countries of the continent: rather, it {{should be based on}} multiple overlapping integration projects involving governments, sub-national and supranational institutions. The presence of several centers of power - the EU, China, India, Russia, as a center of attraction of the former Soviet Union, and Turkey, as an emerging leader of the Islamic West Asia, makes the emergence of a single continental integration organization of a supranational nature very unlikely. A network structure of integration, a so-called [...] "spaghetti bowl" [...] of various kinds of multilateral agreements aimed at solving specific problems, is much more probable. Eurasian integration could drive development by integrating energy trade, non-energy trade and transport, capital and labour flows, tourism, and fighting against drug trading and the spread of epidemics. Vinokurov further argues that open regionalism in Eurasia is an economically optimal supplement to regional integration initiatives, in particular to post-Soviet integration.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} the effective and cost-efficient design {{of renewable energy}} sources (RES) support policies in the European Union along some major discussion lines of the European RES policy debate: {{the effectiveness of the}} different national support policies in the member states the cost savings potential of different cost reduction policies for reaching the 2020 RES target the role of market risk exposure and market integration for RES deployment and the cost-efficiency of RES support the role and design of cross-country cooperation mechanisms for efficient RES target achievement. The analysis showed that the effectiveness and efficiency of RES support policies is still low in many European member states but that top runner countries have gained significant experience in tailored RES policy design. The key recommendations for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of RES support policies across Europe are: Reducing policy and market risks, particularly those that have no or little potential to trigger cost-optimised behaviour of RES generators Ensuring long-term commitment and increasing the stability of the regulatory framework for RES Against the background of the risk-averse financial environment and the new budgetary constraints of the recent financial crisis, it has become even more important for governments to take measures to reduce RES financing risks. Without such risk reduction, it seems unlikely that sufficient investments will be attracted to reach the EU 2020 targets. Furthermore, stable and risk sensitive policies could reduce the policy costs for achieving the target by up to 4 billion Euro per year. In addition to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of their national support instruments, policymakers should consider the increased use of cooperation mechanisms that could potentially further decrease the cost of European RES target achievement by 2 - 3 billion Euro per year, at least if the respective cooperation mechanisms do not introduce additional risks and uncertainties. From the analysis in this thesis, it appears that <b>bottom-up</b> <b>cooperation</b> between member states and alignment of regulatory frameworks according to best-practice criteria is a more promising approach than drastic harmonisation measures that will unsettle the market and require another learning period to improve their effectiveness and efficiency. We have seen that RES policy design has gone through a phase of intense policy learning in the last decade. For the more advanced countries, effective and efficient policy design is an increasingly complex issue that requires individual and fine-tuned approaches. The question remains how the countries whose RES markets are lagging behind can be motivated to learn from this process and to improve their support policies and regulatory frameworks despite the existing economic constraints...|$|E
40|$|The {{legacy of}} a colonialist, assimilationist {{educational}} system {{in countries such}} as Bolivia is the under-representation of the indigenous in the large sphere encompassed by the schools - knowledge, teachers, and modes of instruction. Many indigenous students feel alienated from schooling and experience limited academic success. The calculated intervention of transforming traditional knowledge into culturally-relevant curriculum material has been suggested as a way to fortify their identities. Once students are solidly grounded in their indigenous selves, they may have a greater chance to perform better in the academic indices of formal schooling. This thesis describes a pilot study aligned with the mandates of a UNICEF project (EIBAMAZ) to bring intercultural bilingual education to schools in the Bolivian Amazon. Applying the principles of Participatory Action Research and adopting an anti-colonial stance, I explored the traditional knowledge of the Movima indigenous people and codified some of this into culturally-relevant curriculum material. The material was trialed in schools and feedback was obtained from all the participants. Results, implications and reflections from the pilot serve as recommendations to a larger scale indigenous education project. The investigative stage of the pilot revealed story-telling by community elders to be a natural method for them to exchange information. They saw themselves recording the narratives for their children from whom they felt a widening generational gap. When creating curriculum material in the second stage of the project, the needs of both student and teacher were kept as the focal point. Accessing students’ prior knowledge and catching their interest were of utmost importance. The culturally-relevant lessons were ‘put to the test’ in classrooms in semi-urban and rural schools. Differences between the two groups with respect to participation structure and interaction were noted. Teachers discovered their need for more professional training and cultural congruence between teacher-student to be important in imparting such curriculum. The last stage of the project heard voices from different segments of the population on the topic of culture and culturally-relevant curriculum. The study concludes that {{it is not possible to}} create an idealised indigenous curriculum because the Movima people are no longer living in a way that makes it possible to identify a singular culture which is outside and separate from the dominant national culture of Bolivia. Traditional knowledge is difficult to characterise. Rather than being fixed, it is mutable. It derives not just from the knower but from the interaction of the knower and the inquirer. It is dialogic and the research has shown that bringing it into the curriculum might involve a process of dialogue. Indigenising curriculum is possible to do but it requires full community participation which is precisely what makes it difficult. It is not possible to have a place-based curriculum prescribed from the centre. Because it is context based on the locale, it becomes less the role of the Ministry and more the role of the teacher and the community. Though local epistemologies and culture are domains that influence the content and purpose of schooling, there are other complex relationships (political, cultural, religious, social and organizational) involved in educational development. Top-down and <b>bottom-up</b> <b>cooperation</b> and reinforcement are necessary for the provision and sustainment of a culturally-relevant indigenous education. The research suggests that the success of an indigenising project such as this would depend on the extent to which communities can be facilitated and enthused, whether it can offer sufficient development to teachers to reconceptualise their practice and whether these teachers would have the motivation to persist...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} {{a critical}} {{review of the role}} of Local Government in the conservation of biological diversity (or ‘biodiversity’). Whilst {{the vast majority of the}} text relates to NSW, much of the broader commentary may extend to other Australian jurisdictions. The nub of the thesis is that despite the rhetoric in key documents – including the National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia’s Biological Diversity, the NSW Biodiversity Strategy, the National Local Government Biodiversity Strategy and various plans and policies made at the municipal level – the outlook is grim without fundamental policy, legal and fiscal change. The topic is huge but crucial to any person concerned about the mammoth decline of biodiversity in Australia. Whilst being intrinsically transdisciplinary in nature, the thesis attempts to contribute to the ‘new production of knowledge’. ¹ It raises issues, problems, ideas and recommendations. The work is based on: • A literary search until 2001. The long gap between this date and thesis submission is due to a severe illness suffered by the author, which arose in late Dec 2001. ² • Empirical research into: o nine 1998 / 1999 ‘state of environment’ reports prepared for by councils located roughly in or around the ‘NSW South-western Slopes’ bioregion that is recognised for the extremely limited extent of remnant native vegetation; o conservation related clauses in all gazetted ‘comprehensive’ Local Environmental Plans - i. e. those applying to entire Local Government areas - prepared by councils between 1995 and 2000 inclusively and which remain in force; • Personal discussion with various officials and onlookers directly involved in, or concerned about, biodiversity conservation at the municipal level. Brief summaries of each chapter are provided herein. The introduction initiates discussion on (i) the meaning of ‘biodiversity’, including its shift from a scientific concept to a populist expression, (ii) the position of councils in Australian government and (iii) the significance of biodiversity conservation at the local sphere. It also introduces two related concepts that are met throughout the thesis, which arguably erode council conservation capability: Local Government’s ‘historical and cultural baggage’ and the ‘ratepayer ideology’. The following three chapters provide the ‘historical and institutional’ context. Chapter Two focuses on changing societal perspectives towards the biophysical environment, together with resultant statutory and environmental trends that have paralleled the advancement of Local Government. Chapter Three traces the history of NSW Local Government, demonstrating its entrenchment in the political landscape. It examines major changes, especially functional expansion and managerial reform. Chapter Four scrutinises a particular aspect of municipal experience, namely top-down and <b>bottom-up</b> <b>cooperation</b> between neighbouring councils. This chapter adds consideration of state appointed regional bodies that may arguably sideline Local Government. The regional context is fundamental to environmental management due to the inappropriateness of many council boundaries. The next three chapters concentrate on legislative and financial detail. Chapter Five reviews the Local Government Act 1993 (NSW), which provides wide service powers, limited regulatory opportunity and special requirements for council-owned land. Chapter Six explores the land-use planning system under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW), especially the ongoing influence of its urban background. It raises the perennial influence of ‘developmentalism’ in the determination of applications for development, which directly benefits property interests. Recent statutory change, especially in relation to ‘threatened species’ law, may do little more than support informed habitat destruction. A closely related matter is funding, as discussed throughout Chapter Seven. The issue goes beyond insufficiency. It is argued that Local Government’s primary financial source - i. e. rating, a property tax - works against biodiversity conservation. Not only is there no policy rationale to support rating in the conservation context but the system can provide a ‘perverse incentive’ to rural landholders to clear their lands. This problem is exacerbated by the type of valuation and differential rates. The system demands major overhaul, including consideration of increased conditional Commonwealth funding. The following two chapters relate to attitudes towards the biophysical environment that are popular amongst the general community. Chapter Eight considers the provision of vegetated, passive recreational open space whilst Chapter Nine deals with securing and enhancing local amenity. These approaches, however, can be directly inconsistent with biodiversity conservation. Parochial ‘green’ desires of local constituents can lead to environmental damage. Notwithstanding this, Chapter Ten provides some impressive examples of Local Government supporting biodiversity conservation. But these are isolated and rely on committed individuals. Whilst the pervasive prospect throughout this thesis is one of gloom, the concluding chapter builds on previous discussion by presenting ideas and recommendations to improve the role of Local Government in conserving biodiversity. It emphasises the need for regional approaches, improved funding mechanisms and fresh visions. Councils with bigger areas, supported by community structures to maintain ‘grass roots’ public participation, together with massive change to Local Government funding, may provide a desirable path for municipal reform and retention of Australia’s precious biodiversity. The law discussed throughout this work stands at 1 Jan 2003. Major changes since then are noted in the Postscript. ¹ See ch 1 at 2. ² On 31 Dec 2001, after hospitalisation for 9 days, the author was diagnosed as suffering from a malignant brain tumour, known as astrocytoma. It was removed in 2002, followed by heavy radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and a long period of torpor during which I lived the life a cat, sleeping for over twelve hours per day. I returned to this thesis in July 2002, then spending about 30 minutes per day which expanded over time, and recommenced part-time academic work in 2003. I am now convinced that I have left the cancer behind, being one of the fortunate 20 % of astrocytoma sufferers to survive, supported by a medical team of professional excellence...|$|E
40|$|It is {{increasingly}} considered appropriate {{to deal with}} international energy issues, such as achieving energy market stability and energy supply security and countering climate change, on a regional or even global level. The large energy-importing countries in Northeast Asia – China, Japan and South Korea – have also begun discussing establishing cooperation on energy issues although some obstacles are in place. Based on {{the experiences of the}} European Union, strong top-down imposed cooperation helps creating a strong framework that ensures ongoing integration, but is less effective at achieving results for more specific issues. Therefore, establishing energy cooperation in the Northeast Asian countries should start <b>bottom-up,</b> although top-down <b>cooperation</b> should be aimed for at the same time. By focusing on some more concrete topics first, the cooperation that is established {{on the basis of these}} topics could then be used as a basis for further cooperation. Some topics that could have this function are technology transfer on energy efficiency, joint stockpiling, transportation safety, and external policy to enhance bargaining power towards supplier states. Looking at the experiences of the EU, it is more likely that cooperation will be established on other topics than security issues. Therefore, especially technology transfer could play a large role in establishing energy cooperation in Northeast Asia. ...|$|R
