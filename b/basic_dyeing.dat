40|$|An {{introduction}} to the nomenclature and concept of “Romanowsky stains” {{is followed by a}} brief account of the dyes involved and especially the crucial role of azure B and of the impurity of most commercial dye lots. Technical features of standardized and traditional Romanowsky stains are outlined, e. g., number and ratio of the acidic and basic dyes used, solvent effects, staining times, and fixation effects. The peculiar advantages of Romanowsky staining are noted, namely, the polychromasia achieved in a technically simple manner with the potential for stain intensification of “the color purple. ” Accounts are provided of a variety of physicochemically relevant topics, namely, acidic and <b>basic</b> <b>dyeing,</b> peculiarities of acidic and basic dye mixtures, consequences of differential staining rates of different cell and tissue components and of different dyes, the chemical significance of “the color purple,” the substrate selectivity for purple color formation and its intensification in situ due to a template effect, effects of resin embedding and prior fixation. Based on these physicochemical phenomena, mechanisms for the various Romanowsky staining applications are outlined including for blood, marrow and cytological smears; G-bands of chromosomes; microorganisms and other single-cell entities; and paraffin and resin tissue sections. The common factors involved in these specific mechanisms are pulled together to generate a “universal” generic mechanism for these stains. Certain generic problems of Romanowsky stains are discussed including the instability of solutions of acidic dye–basic dye mixtures, the inherent heterogeneity of polychrome methylene blue, and the resulting problems of standardization. Finally, a rational trouble-shooting scheme is appended...|$|E

40|$|The exact {{mechanism}} by which the ordinary acid and <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> stain bacterial protoplasm {{is yet to be}} explained. The leading theories have been staining (1) by chemical union with the protoplasm, (2) by nonspecific physical adsorption onto surfaces, (3) by adsorption onto specific chemical sites, and (4) by solution in protoplasmic constituents. If staining reactions as a whole are considered, each of these theories will explain some particular case of staining. This paper is restricted in its scope to the staining of bacterial protoplasm by common <b>basic</b> and acid <b>dyes.</b> Perhaps the most widely accepted theory of bacterial staining was presented by Stearn and Stearn (1929, 1930), who showed that acid dyes stain bacterial cells best under acid conditions and <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> stain best under basic conditions. This was explained by the amphoteric nature of proteins; thus, acid dyes could react with amino groups, and <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> could react with carboxyl groups, de-pending on the particular state of ionization of the protein. The idea of <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> combining with carboxyl groups of proteins was excellent. However, proo...|$|R

40|$|The pine cone and oak cups pulp {{were used}} as {{low-cost}} adsorbents {{for the removal of}} basic (Basic Red 18) and acidic (Acid Red 111) dyes and Cr (VI) from aqueous solutions. The adsorbents were modified by HNO 3 to improve their biosorption capacity. The adsorbents were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and FTIR spectroscopy. The zeta potential was determined {{as a function of the}} pH, in order to explain the effect of pH on electrostatic adsorption ability of biosorbent. Modification of adsorbents with nitric acid led to an increase in accessibility of some functional groups on the surface or a decrease in negativity of surface charge. The modification of pine cone increased its adsorption capacity for the <b>basic</b> <b>dye,</b> whereas the modification of oak cups pulp decreased the adsorption ability for <b>basic</b> <b>dye</b> to some extent. The adsorption isotherms fitted the Langmuir model. The adsorption capacities were found to be 142. 85, 158. 73, and 156. 20 [*]mg g- 1 for modified and raw pine cone and oak cups pulp, respectively. The acidic dye and Cr (VI) adsorptions were much lower compared to <b>basic</b> <b>dye</b> on all tested adsorbents.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Acid and <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> and food colours have been determined by electroanalytical techniques, i. e., amperometric titration, potentiometry using ion selective electrodes developed here, and differential pulse polarography. Several procedures for {{the determination of the}} food colours Sunset Yellow FCF and Tartrazine in sparkling orangeade, Green S and Tartrazine in sparkling limeade, Amaranth and Green S in blackcurrant health drink, and Chocolate Brown HT, Green S and Tartrazine in sparkling dandelion & burdock have been developed by differential pulse polarography in Britton-Robinson buffer. Tetraphenylphosphonium chloride removes the large polarographic maximum obtained with Tartrazine at pH values greater than 4 and causes the peak potential of the colour to be shifted towards more negative potentials. The addition of tetramethylammonium chloride improves the polarographic baseline for the peaks of colours by suppressing polarographic maxima. The food colours in each drink could be simultaneously determined by the control of pH in addition to the use of tetraphenylphosphonium chloride. PVC and liquid state ion-selective electrodes have been developed for the determination of acid and <b>basic</b> <b>dyes.</b> The electrodes are based on <b>basic</b> <b>dye</b> 12 -tungstosilicate, <b>basic</b> <b>dye</b> tetraphenylborate, tetraphenylphosphonium 12 -tungstosilicate, quinoline phosphomolybdate and CI Basic Orange 30 : 1 -Reineckate. PVC electrodes based on Crystal Violet tetraphenylborate and tetraphenylphosphonium 12 -tungstosilicate have produced satisfactory results for the potentiometric titration of several acid dyes with Crystal Violet and <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> with sodium tetraphenylborate. The response of the electrodes was sufficiently fast that the electrodes could be used in connection with an automatic titrator. In general, the slope factor of these PVC electrodes was Nernstian, but it gradually decreased with time. Liquid state electrodes using a natural rubber membrane containing Crystal Violet 12 -tungstosilicate or Crystal Violet tetraphenylborate as active material dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene have also been applied successfully to the potentiometric titration of dyes. The life of these electrodes is relatively long because of their easy regeneration. Amperometric titration employing differential pulse polarography showed a promising applicability for the determination of dyes. The end points for the titration curves of acid dyes with a standard Crystal Violet solution and <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> with a sodium tetraphenylborate solution were easily determined by a simple graphical method. The high solubility of the precipitate formed causes the curves to be rounded and also the end point to be reached late...|$|R

40|$|MCM- 22 was {{employed}} {{as an effective}} adsorbent for removal of <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> including methylene blue, crystal violet, and rhodamine B from aqueous solution. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms were investigated. The adsorption capacity of MCM- 22 for three dyes follows an order of MB > CV similar to RB. Kinetic studies indicate that the adsorption follows the pseudo second-order kinetics and the adsorption is a two-step diffusion process with film diffusion dominating the process. The adsorption isotherm can be well fitted by both the Langmuir and the Freundlich models. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that the adsorption of <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> on MCM- 22 is an endothennic reaction. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Wild-type {{strains of}} Escherichia coli K- 12 are {{resistant}} to acriflavine. Gene acrA+ which determines resistance to acriflavine is located near the lac region of the chromosome. This gene determines not only resistance to <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> but also resistance to phenethyl alcohol. Acriflavine resistance was transmitted, together with phenethyl alcohol resistance, from a resistant Hfr strain to a sensitive recipient by mating. Reversion of the mutant gene acrA 1 (phenotypically acriflavine-sensitive) to acriflavine resistance {{was accompanied by a}} change from phenethyl alcohol sensitivity to resistance, and conversely the revertants selected for phenethyl alcohol resistance were resistant to acriflavine. A suppressor mutation, sup- 100, closely linked to the acr locus, suppresses the acrA 1 gene (phenotypically acriflavine-resistant), but does not determine resistance to phenethyl alcohol and <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> other than acriflavine. The genetic change in the locus acrA 1 to types resistant to <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> and phenethyl alcohol was accompanied by an increase in resistance to sodium dodecyl sulfate, a potent solvent of lipopolysaccharide and lipoprotein.

40|$|The {{calcification}} of rat hypertrophic cartilage {{slices in}} vitro is markedly inhibited by preliminary exposure to metachromatic and other <b>basic</b> <b>dyes.</b> The dyes are effective at 10 – 3 to 10 – 4 M {{in the absence}} of calcium and phosphate. This inhibition does not occur at the same low dye concentration if calcium and phosphate are present. Neither ion alone is effective in preventing the inhibition. The inhibitory action can be removed by placing slices which have been treated with <b>basic</b> <b>dye</b> in a solution which contains calcium and phosphate ions, plus an acid dye, Orange G. Most acid dyes do not inhibit calcification, except at very high concentrations. Alizarin and quinalizarin are exceptional, and produce marked inhibition at 10 – 3 M, an effect which is perhaps attributable to the tendency of these dyes to form lakes with calcium. Rachitic cartilage slices which no longer calcify in inorganic phosphate as a result of treatment with <b>basic</b> <b>dyes</b> show normal calcification in the presence of organic phosphate esters. These results are discussed in terms of the possibility that chondroitin sulfate ester participates in normal calcification...|$|R

30|$|The {{effect of}} pH on the visible light {{photocatalytic}} degradation of <b>basic</b> <b>dye</b> BCB was studied in pH range 5 – 10 at metal oxide nanomaterial and 1 × 10 − 4 M dye concentration. The {{results showed that}} the rate of decolorization increased with the increase in pH from 5 to 10 (Fig.  8 b). The photocatalytic performance of the metal oxide was attributed to the surface electrical properties, which facilitate the dye adsorption. It is beneficial for the promotion of visible light generated charge carrier, i.e., electron, to the surface, which leads to the formation of hydroxide radical. Moreover, the pH of the dye solution has a substantial influence on the photocatalytic degradation process, so pH 10 is recommended for <b>basic</b> <b>dyes.</b>|$|R
