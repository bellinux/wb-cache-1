50|$|The Movement Action Plan is a {{strategic}} model for waging nonviolent social movements developed by <b>Bill</b> <b>Moyer,</b> a US social change activist.

Housing in the area was segregated in a de facto way, enforced by covenants and real estate practices. This movement ended within a Summit Conference that included Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the years}} after the end of the Vietnam War, protest in the US came to assume more orderly forms, and was {{increasingly}} dominated by the middle-class. When the anti-nuclear power movement made progress after the partial meltdown of Three Mile Island, a rigorously nonviolent strategy—promoted by <b>Bill</b> <b>Moyer</b> and the Movement for a New Society, and embodied in the Clamshell Alliance—was often credited for the advance, and these methods came to dominate the social justice community. This corresponded with the rise of a highly effective police strategy of crowd control called [...] "negotiated management."

A month after the election, Martin was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} on one count of mail fraud and was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and $201,118 to the city in restitution.

25|$|In the 1980s Alpert created The Herb Alpert Foundation and the Alpert Awards in the Arts with The California Institute of the Arts (CalArts). The Foundation {{supports}} {{youth and}} arts {{education as well}} as environmental issues and helps fund the PBS series <b>Bill</b> <b>Moyers</b> on Faith and Reason and later Moyers & Company. Alpert and his wife donated $30 million to University of California, Los Angeles in 2007, to form and endow the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music {{as part of the}} restructured UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture. He gave $24 million, which included $15 million from April 2008, to CalArts for its music curricula, and provided funding for the culture jamming activists The Yes Men. In 2012, the Foundation gave a grant of more than $5 million to the Harlem School of the Arts, which allowed the school to retire its debt, restore its endowment, and create a scholarship program for needy students; in 2013, the school's building was renamed the Herb Alpert Center. In 2016, his foundation also made a $10.1 million donation to Los Angeles City College that will provide all music majors at the school with a tuition-free education, beginning in fall of 2017.

Until his death in October, 2002, <b>Bill</b> <b>Moyer</b> continued to teach his influential eight-stage model for social change movements, the Movement Action Plan, to activists around the US and around the world.

Other former MNS members (Felice Yeskel, Chuck Collins, Betsy Leondar-Wright, Jerry Koch-Gonzalez, Anne Slepian Ellinger, Christopher Mogil Ellinger) were key in founding and sustaining organizations focused on class issues, such as United for a Fair Economy, Class Action, Bolder Giving, and the Program on Inequality and the Common Good. Other MNS alumni have taken leadership in creating a more environmentally friendly and socially conscious business culture, including Shel Horowitz, Herb Ettel, and D. Dina Friedman.|$|R

[...] Seitz compares [...] "Private Violence" [...] to other documentaries about domestic violence, stating that [...] "None can touch the power, sensitivity, and explanatory skill of this one.

[...] <b>Bill</b> <b>Moyer's</b> included {{it among the}} 10 great social justice documentary films of 2014: [...] "The domestic abuse relationship is so uniquely tragic because it happens behind closed doors where it abides by its own twisted rules and illogic.

James Basker also acknowledged this force when he explained why he chose [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] to represent a collection of anti-slavery poetry: [...] "there is a transformative power that is applicable... : the transformation of sin and sorrow into grace, of suffering into beauty, of alienation into empathy and connection, of the unspeakable into imaginative literature." ...|$|E

In the speech, Humphrey proclaimed that the election would be about [...] "common sense, and a time for maturity, strength and responsibility." [...] He set his goals at not simply winning the nomination but winning {{in a way that would}} [...] "unite [...] party" [...] so he could then [...] "unite and govern [...] nation."

500|$|The {{constitution}} was {{a milestone in}} the history of law and the rise of democracy. Irish statesman Edmund Burke described it as [...] "the noblest benefit received by any nation at any time... StanislasII has earned a place among the greatest kings and statesmen in history." [...] It was the first to follow the 1788 ratification of the United States Constitution. Poland and the United States, though geographically distant, displayed similarities in their approaches to the design of political systems. The May 3 Constitution has been called the second constitution in world history. American expert on constitutional law Albert Blaustein called it the [...] "world's second national constitution", and American journalist <b>Bill</b> <b>Moyers</b> wrote that it was [...] "Europe's first codified national constitution (and the second oldest in the world)". British historian Norman Davies calls it [...] "the first constitution of its type in Europe". Together with the Great Sejm, it has been subject to a large body of works by Polish scholars, starting with the still-often cited 19th-century works of Walerian Kalinka and Władysław Smoleński, and continued in the 20th century by Bogusław Leśnodorski.|$|E

In general, however, Dawkins has followed {{the advice of his}} late colleague Stephen Jay Gould and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because [...] "what they seek is the oxygen of respectability", and doing so would [...] "give them this oxygen by the mere act of engaging with them at all". He suggests that creationists [...] "don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public."

40|$|The Movement Action Plan (MAP) {{was created}} by <b>Bill</b> <b>Moyer</b> (1933 - 2002), an {{experienced}} activist engaged in movements for civil rights, peace and the environment, as he believed activists need {{to become aware of}} the roles they and their organisations are playing in the larger social movement in order to become successful. MAP is a practical strategy and action-planning model as well as a “how-to-do it” analytical tool for evaluating and organising social movements. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate if the success of the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation (SSNC) can be explained by the MAP model through a triangulation of methods; quantitative content analysis of the SSNC’s action plans and annual reports (2000 - 2005), as well as qualitative interviews with employees at the SSNC. Throughout the research materials and interviews, the organisation clearly demonstrates that they advocate as effective activists according to Moyer. The overall conclusion from this research is that Moyer’s tools to a great extent already is utilised, and that this could explain the SSNC’s success in transforming from a small group of educated elites into becoming a social movement...|$|R
