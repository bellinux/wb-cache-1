5|$|The Sovereign still {{exercised}} a {{power to}} <b>be</b> <b>reckoned</b> {{with in the}} eighteenth century. The Court remained {{the centre of the}} political world. The King was limited in that he had to choose Ministers who could command a majority in Parliament, but the choice remained his. The leader of an administration still had to command the King's personal confidence and approval. A strong following in Parliament depended on being able to supply places, pensions, and other marks of Royal favour to the government's supporters.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{believed}} she had showed Spain that the French monarchy, {{far from being}} financially ruined and at war with its nobles, remained a glorious force to <b>be</b> <b>reckoned</b> with, capable of financing displays on a stunning scale, backed by a unified court. The point was lost on the grim Duke of Alba, however. His letters reveal his frustration that Catherine’s spectacles kept interrupting the serious business of discussing how to make war on the Protestants. In the end, the Spanish decided the whole meeting been a waste of time, since Catherine had refused to change her policy towards the Huguenots in the slightest. The Huguenots, however, believed that their banishment from the talks between the two negotiating teams meant that Catherine had struck a secret deal with the Spanish to persecute them.|$|E
5|$|In 1992–93, {{the inaugural}} {{season of the}} English Premier League, Norwich City led the league {{for much of the}} season, having been among the {{pre-season}} favourites for relegation, and were eight points clear of the field shortly before Christmas, before faltering in the final weeks to finish third behind the champions, Manchester United, and Aston Villa. They had shown that they were a force to <b>be</b> <b>reckoned</b> with from the very first day of the Premier League season, achieving an impressive 4–2 away win over an Arsenal side who were among the pre-season title favourites in a race finally won by Manchester United. This was a big surprise not least to the media and pundits who had tipped Norwich for a season of struggle.|$|E
50|$|Years <b>were</b> <b>reckoned</b> {{according}} to reigns and cycles. The Reign of Incarnation was all time {{up to the}} American Revolutionary War. The First Reign of our Incarnation was the period between the Revolution {{and the establishment of}} the original Klan, which <b>was</b> <b>reckoned</b> to May 6, 1866 in this scheme. The Reign of our Second Incarnation <b>was</b> <b>reckoned</b> between 1866 and Grand Wizard Nathan Bedford Forrest's dissolution of the Klan, which <b>is</b> <b>reckoned</b> to 1872. The Reign of our Third Incarnation began in 1915. The Klan year, Anno Klan, began in May of each year, and the cycle <b>was</b> <b>reckoned</b> from December of each calendar year.|$|R

5|$|In 1945, Thurman {{attended}} the San Francisco Conference for {{the founding of}} the United Nations as part of an unofficial delegation. The official African-American delegation included W. E. B. Du Bois, founder of the NAACP; Walter Francis White, Executive Secretary of the NAACP; and Mary McLeod Bethune founder of the National Council of Negro Women, but Bethune insisted on sending three additional observers from the NCNW, which included Thurman. After the event, Thurman published a report in the Chicago Defender on April 16, 1945, in which she questioned the limited role that people of color played in the proceedings and pointed out that the large populations of developing countries would become a force to <b>be</b> <b>reckoned</b> with. Thurman, as a representative for the NCNW, {{attended the}} Primer Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres held in Guatemala City, Guatemala, in 1947. The congress addressed many of the issues she supported such as women's rights, internationalism, and peace initiatives. In 1949, she led a delegation of members from the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples to Paris for the Fourth Plenary Session of UNESCO.|$|E
5|$|On 8 February 1963, the Iraqi Regional Branch, led by Ali Salih al-Sa'di, {{took power}} in Iraq by overthrowing Abd al-Karim Qasim. He {{was a far}} more {{formidable}} opponent than al-Kudsi, and the Iraqi Regional Branch managed to take power through an alliance not only with military officers, but also with segments of the middle class. Qasim's downfall changed the rules of Arab politics – the Nasserists had monopolised the Arab nationalist movement since the UAR, but the takeover made the Ba'ath Party a force to <b>be</b> <b>reckoned</b> with. In contrast to the Iraqi regional branch, the Syrian regional branch did not have mass support or a significant support base in the middle class. While Aflaq cautioned the plotters because of the party's lack of support, they failed to share his worries, and launched the coup on 7 March. However, that day the military intelligence raided the apartment where the plotters were planning to assemble. Assad was given the task of reporting to other units that the coup had been postponed to 8 March.|$|E
5|$|Although Hermes o Logios was {{the most}} {{important}} publication for the transmission of progressive ideas to the Greek people, which should ultimately lead to the emancipation and independence, there was hardly any information of signs of an ongoing revolution, at least on the surface. There was the Austrian censure to <b>be</b> <b>reckoned</b> with, as the reactionary minister Klemens von Metternich and his secret police kept a very close eye on the activities of the local Greek community. The lack of items on politics, polity, law and social structures does not indicate an immanent revolution. Several editors were also members of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia and staunch supporters of the struggle for independence, but one can hardly maintain that this fervent patriotism is reflected in the subjects treated inside the periodical. Even in the last years, {{on the eve of the}} Greek War of Independence, in the fields of philology, sciences, philanthropy, etc., nothing out of the ordinary was published. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the contributors of Hermes o Logios dreamed of the liberation of the Greek nation and of an independent state.|$|E
25|$|For those airmen and airwomen whose service {{commenced}} before 3 September 1939, {{the time}} served <b>was</b> <b>reckoned</b> as time-and-a-half. Service on flying duties with the Royal Air Force {{or any other}} Commonwealth Air Force during the Second World War between 3 September 1939 and 2 September 1945 <b>was</b> <b>reckoned</b> as treble time. Service on other than flying duties <b>was</b> normally <b>reckoned</b> as single time, but while embodied within the Royal Air Force or any Commonwealth Air Force during the Second World War, such service <b>was</b> <b>reckoned</b> as double time.|$|R

5|$|There {{were few}} {{airborne}} {{resources available to}} the British Army by mid-1941. The only unit trained and available for an airborne operation was No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion, {{there were very few}} transport aircraft available to transport an airborne force, there were few RAF flight crews with experience of parachute droppings and none with operational experience, and there were no specialized overseas facilities to cater exclusively for airborne operations. However, it had been decided that some form of airborne operation would have to be carried out. The reasons for mounting an operation with such meagre resources were two-fold; firstly a successful raid would demonstrate {{to the rest of the}} world that Britain was still a force to <b>be</b> <b>reckoned</b> with and had not been defeated, and secondly a raid would test the fighting ability of the battalion and its equipment, as well as the RAF's ability to deliver paratroopers at a predetermined location at a required time. The target chosen for the operation was an aqueduct that crossed the Tragino river in the Campania province of southern Italy near the town of Calitri. The aqueduct carried the main water supply for the province of Apulia, which at the time was inhabited by approximately two million Italians and included the strategically important port of Taranto; it was hoped that destroying the aqueduct and depriving the population of their regular water supply would damage their morale, and also have some impact on the Italian war efforts in North Africa and Albania. The aqueduct was a significant distance from the Italian coast, making it unlikely that a sea-borne raiding party could reach it, and it was believed that it was too strongly constructed to be destroyed by aerial bombing; as such, an airborne raid conducted by parachute troops was thought to be the ideal way to eliminate the aqueduct.|$|E

25|$|Further, the Umayyads appear {{not to have}} scouted northward for {{potential}} foes, for if they had, they surely would have noted Charles Martel as a force to <b>be</b> <b>reckoned</b> with in his own account, because of his growing domination of much of Europe from 717: this might have alerted the Umayyads that a real power led by a gifted general was rising {{from the ashes of}} the Western Roman Empire.|$|E

Once again, one of the fastest cars for most of the week, it seemed however that the Brock/Skaife Holden Racing Team car, the Greg Murphy/Lowndes Holden Racing Team car, the Gardner/Crompton Coca-Cola car, and the Alan Jones/Jason Bright/Scott Pruett Komatsu car were forces to <b>be</b> <b>reckoned</b> with.|$|E
25|$|Further, {{unlike his}} father at Tours, Rahman's son in 736–737 knew that the Franks were a real power, and that Charles {{personally}} was a force to <b>be</b> <b>reckoned</b> with. He {{had no intention of}} allowing Charles to catch him unaware and dictate the time and place of battle, as his father had. He concentrated instead on seizing {{a substantial portion of the}} coastal plains around Narbonne in 736 and heavily reinforced Arles as he advanced inland.|$|E

His spin-bowling partnership with Timycen Maruma {{has resulted in a}} series of domestic titles, and in 2008-09 his ten-wicket haul helped Easterns clinch a thrilling one-wicket victory in a low-scoring contest against Northerns at Alexandra Sports Club in Harare that secured the Logan Cup. Utseya enjoyed a steady, if unspectacular, domestic season in 2009-10, though his franchise, Mountaineers dominated the first-class scene.|$|E

Wartime service counted as double time, while half of the time served as a rating or in the ranks could <b>be</b> <b>reckoned</b> as qualifying service for the decoration.

Service in West Africa, natives of West Africa and periods spent on leave excluded, and war service was reckoned two-fold as qualifying service for the decoration.|$|E
25|$|Michael VIII {{was a very}} energetic, {{ambitious and}} capable emperor, who had {{enlarged}} and preserved the Empire and had once again made Byzantium a power to <b>be</b> <b>reckoned</b> with in the region. His army however was still small, and diplomacy was relied upon more than ever. An extortionate tax system supported his ambitious and successful foreign policies of expansion, {{as well as his}} numerous bribes and gifts to various potentates. He had put Byzantium on the road of recovery, but his achievements were still perilously fragile, as events would soon show.|$|E

The 22nd Sentai re-equipped with production Hayates. Though it lacked sufficient high-altitude performance, it performed well at medium and low levels. Seeing action against the USAAF 14th Air Force, it quickly gained a reputation as a fighter to <b>be</b> <b>reckoned</b> with. Fighter-bomber models also entered service. On April 15, 1945, 11 Hayates attacked US airfields on Okinawa, destroying many aircraft on the ground.|$|E
25|$|But in the foray to Powell's Valley, Martin had {{established}} his credentials as a hard-bitten explorer. Daniel Boone {{and his party}} of explorers were stunned in 1769 when, upon their arrival in Powell's Valley, they discovered that Martin and his 20-man party had beaten them there. It was beyond the farthest reaches that Boone and his long hunters had explored. Following Martin's feat, the Albemarle County native became a force to <b>be</b> <b>reckoned</b> with in exploration circles, even though Martin's settlement was soon broken up by the Cherokees, who pushed back against the westernmost settlement yet attempted.|$|E
