It had been necessarily impossible to conceal her mother's name from her. The discovery of her father, if she heard of Regina and Regina's uncle, would be simply a question of time. What might such a man be not capable of doing, what new act of treachery might he not commit, if he found himself claimed by the daughter whom he had deserted? Even if the expression of Mrs. Farnaby's last wishes had not been sacred to Amelius, this consideration alone would have kept him silent, for Sally's sake.|$|E

60|$|The serious {{nature of}} the situation, the indisputable {{certainty}} that Kirke must fail in tracing Magdalen's friends unless he first knew who she really was, had decided the captain on disclosing part, at least, of the truth. Declining to enter into any particulars--for family reasons, which Magdalen might explain on her recovery, if she pleased--he astounded Kirke by telling him that the friendless woman whom he had rescued, and whom he had only known up to that moment as Miss Bygrave--was no other than the youngest daughter of Andrew Vanstone. The disclosure, on Kirke's side, of his father's connection with the young officer in Canada, had followed naturally on the revelation of Magdalen's real name. Captain Wragge had expressed his surprise, but had made no further remark at the time. A fortnight later, however, when the patient's recovery forced the serious difficulty on the doctor of meeting the questions which Magdalen <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> the captain's ingenuity had come, as usual, to the rescue.|$|R
60|$|Gilmore {{had once}} {{consulted}} his uncle,--once in an evil moment, as he now felt,--whether {{it would not}} be well for him to marry Miss Lowther. The uncle had expressed himself as very adverse to the marriage, and would now, on this occasion, <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> some question about it. When the great man arrived the Squire was out, still wandering round among the bullocks and sheep; but the evening after dinner would be very long. On the following day Mr. and Mrs. Fenwick, with Mr. and Mrs. Greenthorne, were to dine at the Privets. If this first evening were only through, Gilmore thought that he could get some comfort, even from his uncle. As he came near the house, he went into the yard, and saw the Prebendary's grand carriage, which was being washed. No; as far as the groom knew, Mr. Chamberlaine had not gone out; but was in the house then. So Gilmore entered, and found his uncle in the library.|$|E

[...] Major Grantly said that he would wait and would see Grace on that afternoon. Mrs. Dale again suggested that he should lunch with her, but this he declined. She then proposed that he should go across and call upon the squire, and thus consume his time. But to this he also objected. He was not exactly in the humour, he said, to renew so old and so slight an acquaintance at that time. Mr. Dale would probably have forgotten him, and would <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> what had brought him to Allington. He would go and take a walk, he said, and come again exactly at half-past three. Mrs. Dale again expressed her certainty that the young ladies would be back by that time, and Major Grantly left the house.|$|E

60|$|Then {{he heard}} someone riding {{along the road}} towards the house. It was the farmer coming home. He was a very worthy man; but he had one great peculiarity--namely, {{that he could not}} bear to see a sexton. If he saw one he was made quite mad. That was why the sexton had gone to say good-day to the farmer's wife when he knew that her husband was not at home, and the good woman {{therefore}} put in front of him the best food she had. But when they heard the farmer coming they were frightened, and the farmer's wife begged the sexton to creep into a great empty chest. He did so, as he knew the poor man could not bear to see a sexton. The wife hastily hid all the beautiful food and the wine in her oven; for if her husband had seen it, he would have <b>been</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> what it all meant.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, {{this man}} Tomkins seemed by some secret means to have gained the {{confidence}} in part, {{if not in}} whole, of almost every one connected with these intrigues.

When he chanced to appear at Woodstock, which always seemed as it were by accident--if he passed through the hall, the knight <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him <b>to</b> take the foils, and was equally certain to be, after less or more resistance, victorious in the encounter; so, in consideration of so many triumphs, the good Sir Henry almost forgave him the sins of rebellion and puritanism. Then, if his slow and formal step was heard in the passages approaching the gallery, Dr. Rochecliffe, though he never introduced him to his peculiar boudoir, <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> meet Master Tomkins in some neutral apartment, and to engage him in long conversations, which apparently had great interest for both.|$|R

60|$|He obeyed, {{so far as}} to go away at once, {{and having}} once started, he did not stop short of the purser's office. He made an excuse of getting greenbacks for some English bank-notes, and then he said casually that he {{supposed}} there would be no chance of having his room on the lower deck changed for something a little less intimate with the sea. The purser was not there to take the humorous view, but he conceived that March wanted something higher up, {{and he was able to}} offer him a room of those on the promenade where he had seen swells going in and out, for six hundred dollars. March did not blench, but said he would get his wife to look at it with him, and then he went out somewhat dizzily to take counsel with himself how he should put the matter to her. She would <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> what the price of the new room would be, and he debated whether to take it and tell her some kindly lie about it, or trust to the bracing effect of the sum named in helping restore the lost balance of her nerves. He was not so rich that he could throw six hundred dollars away, but there might be worse things; and he walked up and down thinking. All at once it flashed upon him that he had better see the doctor, anyway, and find out whether there were not some last hope in medicine before he took the desperate step before him. He turned in half his course, and ran into a lady who had just emerged from the door of the promenade laden with wraps, and who dropped them all and clutched him to save herself from falling.|$|E
6000|$|In {{respect of}} the light {{companionship}} of common usage, however, it is exactly the costume which comes closest to us, and bad taste in that is most jarring and least easily forgiven. There is a certain stage in an observant person's experience of the heedlessness, indolence, and native folly of men and women--and if his observation be conducted in a catholic spirit, he will probably see something of this not merely in others--when the tolerable average sanity of human arrangements strikes him as the most marvellous of all the fortunate accidents in the universe. Rousseau could not even accept the fact of this miraculous result, the provisional and temporary sanity of things, and he confronted society with eyes of angry chagrin. A great lady asked him how {{it was that she}} had not seen him for an age. [...] "Because when I wish to see you, I wish to see no one but you. What {{do you want me to}} do in the midst of your society? I should cut a sorry figure in a circle of mincing tripping coxcombs; they do not suit me." [...] We cannot wonder that on some occasion when her son's proficiency was to be tested before a company of friends, Madame d'Epinay prayed Rousseau to be of them, on the ground that he would <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the child outrageously absurd questions, which would give gaiety to the affair.[219] As it happened, the father was unwise. He was a man of whom it was said that he had devoured two million francs, without either saying or doing a single good thing. He rewarded the child's performance with the gift of a superb suit of cherry-coloured velvet, extravagantly trimmed with costly lace; the peasant from whose sweat and travail the money had been wrung, went in heavy rags, and his children lived as the beasts of the field. The poor youth was ill dealt with. [...] "That is very fine," [...] said rude Duclos, [...] "but remember that a fool in lace is still a fool." [...] Rousseau, in reply to the child's importunity, was still blunter: [...] "Sir, I am no judge of finery, I am only a judge of man; I wished to talk with you a little while ago, but I wish so no longer."[220] ...|$|E
5000|$|Denys Fisher/Mego {{released}} {{a selection of}} 9" [...] figures in the mid-1970s, including the Fourth Doctor, Leela, K-9 (released in 1978 after the first six), the Giant Robot, a Cyberman, a Dalek, and a TARDIS. The Dalek and K-9 have friction drives to allow for movement. The TARDIS has a self-propelled spinning top. The Doctor could be inserted into the TARDIS and the [...] "light" [...] on top was spun. If the red button was hit while the top was spinning, the Doctor [...] "disappeared". If the green button was hit, the Doctor re-appeared. These toys are all extremely rare and difficult to find, especially in near mint or mint condition. The Tom Baker figure {{is the most common}} and can be found in an English or Italian box. A mint (or near mint) Baker figure with the box is worth between $150-500, depending on quality of the figure and the box. The Tom Baker figure with the Italian box is more common (and may sell for as little as $75-200). The other figures, excluding the TARDIS, are worth $500-1200 if they are in near mint quality and have their original box, even if the box is damaged. In May 2006, a Denys Fisher Dalek with box sold for over $1150 on eBay. The TARDIS is usually a bit cheaper at $200-350 (provided it has no damage or any repairs are not noticeable and the box is included). Of course, this is relative and eBay auctions can vary considerably. While a mint Leela may sell for $500-600, one without a box may only sell for $150-200. That said, some items are so rare that even a damaged item, or one with missing pieces, is worth a fair amount. For example, in May 2006, a Leela doll without her loin cloth (and correspondingly, without the attached pouches and knife) but with her original, but highly damaged box, sold for over $350. It really depends on competition, timing and if serious bidding is occurring. Nonetheless, considering these toys sold in the UK for under GBP £10 in the 1970s, their value has gone up nearly 10- to 100-fold and will most likely continue to rise due to the popularity of the new Doctor Who series. Some stress cracks due to time and cannot be avoided, but more serious cracks or discolouration will decrease the value considerably. The more damaged the item is, obviously, the less it is worth. These are very simple toys, as none require batteries, have any flashing lights or speak, but they have become quite collectible. The rarity of the boxes (or high quality boxes) has led to people selling box reproductions. These reproduced boxes can be an alternative as they are less expensive than finding a figure with the original box, although true collectors may not appreciate them. <b>Be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> if the box is original or a reproduction. Along those lines, some of these toys can be repaired. The TARDIS [...] "light" [...] and doors easily broke, but repairs by those with ingenuity or toy-repair skills can be done. Simply re-glueing the light or the doors rarely works for this toy, so more advanced repairs are needed. Flaking damage on the Cyberman suit can be repaired using a high quality silver paint for fabric. Dust on many figures can be removed by air-blown sprays or delicate washing. Leela's hair can be repaired by combing, conditioning and steam-cleaning. Delicate repainting can also be done on some figures. The key is to do just enough repairs, without ruining the essence of the original. Any repair work should be noted in ads (often a seller will simply sell the damaged item and leave repairs to the buyer). If unsure, ask the seller. The Denys Fisher K-9 or Dalek may be initially confused with the talking Palitoy K-9 or Dalek toys. The Palitoy talking toys were {{released a}}round the same time and are also quite collectable. Finding a good quality talking K-9 or Dalek, that speak at a [...] "normal" [...] speed and have their original boxes, can cost anywhere from $200-500. Even without the box, the toy could be worth $100-150 if in good speaking condition. If the toys do not speak, their value drops considerably (not more than $50-100 for a non-speaking Dalek). A working Palitoy K-9 is more rare and may be more costly. Both toys speak via a small vinyl record that is inside or near the battery compartment. The K-9 record is inside the battery compartment and the record can be flipped over, giving K-9 more phrases. The Dalek record is buried within the toy and cannot be removed. The Palitoy K-9 is considerably larger than the Denys Fisher line, so the two cannot be confused when visually compared. The Palitoy Dalek is considerably different from the Denys Fisher Dalek, although it is similar in size. The Palitoy Dalek came in red with black Dalek [...] "spots" [...] or [...] "bumps" [...] and in silver-grey with blue [...] "bumps". The silver/blue Dalek is a bit more rare. Both Palitoy Daleks had black extremities, with a red end on the eye and red suction cup. The Denys Fisher Dalek is also silver/blue, but has a red head and a blue eye piece (with silver gun and suction cup). Palitoy toys also tended to rust and crack.|$|E
