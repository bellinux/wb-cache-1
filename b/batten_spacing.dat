40|$|The thermal {{performance}} of a ventilated pitched roof with tiled coverings is analysed and compared with unventilated roofs. The analysis is carried out {{by means of a}} finite element numerical code, by solving both the fluid and thermal problems in steady-state. A whole one-floor building with a pitched roof is schematized as a 2 D computational domain including the air-permeability of tiled covering. Realistic data sets for wind, temperature and solar radiation are used to simulate summer conditions at different times of the day. The results demonstrate that the <b>batten</b> <b>space</b> in pitched roofs is an effective solution for reducing the solar heat gain in summer and thus for achieving better indoor comfort conditions. The efficiency of the ventilation is strictly linked to the external wind conditions and to buoyancy forces occurring due to the heating of the tiles...|$|R
25|$|The Westport Country Playhouse has a {{counterweight}} fly system currently employing 22 <b>battens,</b> with <b>space</b> {{for future}} installations. The height {{from the stage}} to the grid is 40 feet (12.19m), with an effective fly range from 3 feet 10inches (1.17m) to 38 feet (11.58m). Each arbor is 6 feet tall with a capacity for 1200 pounds (544kg). The locking rail is on the stage right wall, and the loading bridge is 32 feet 3inches (9.83m) above the stage floor.|$|R
50|$|Battens {{are used}} for solid wall insulation. Regularly <b>spaced</b> <b>battens</b> are fitted to the wall, the spaces between them filled with insulation, and {{plasterboard}} or drywall screwed to the battens. This method {{is no longer the}} most popular, as rigid insulation sheets give better insulation (with battens bridging the insulation) and take less time to fit.|$|R
50|$|The bull nosed {{verandah}} awning of Oonooraba {{is supported}} on turned columns with curved brackets, paired toward the principal {{entrance of the}} house. Above the columns are frieze panels, comprising diagonal latticework flanking a central section of vertical battening. The verandah balustrades which are replacements of a cast iron balustrade, are of vertical timber battening with decorative cutouts in regularly <b>spaced</b> <b>battens.</b> Many early lattice screens and timber louvres survive in the verandah openings.|$|R

Although the fly system and grid are designed for loads to be hung parallel to the proscenium, smaller loads can be hung perpendicular using cables independent of the actual arbor system. These have to be flown in and out manually from the grid, so perpendicularly hung loads are generally stationary during performances.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effectiveness of}} the strengthening technique for deficient reinforced concrete columns using steel angles and battens. The compressive strength of concrete was chosen as 9 MPa to represent poor concrete quality. The experiment consisted of a control reinforced concrete column and columns that were strengthened by steel angles and battens. In this study, the effectiveness of different configurations of battens was investigated; different amounts of battens as well as different spacing while maintaining amount of steel. The results showed that both load carrying capacity and ductility of the strengthened columns could be significantly improved. While maintaining the same amount of <b>battens,</b> different <b>spacing</b> does not show significant difference in load carrying capacity but affects ductility. The experimental results showed that using steel angles and battens is effective for strengthening reinforced concrete even when the compressive strength of the concrete is very low...|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} batten, a.k.a. lighting batten, {{may be a}} single-pipe or truss batten. Electric battens typically incorporate steel straps {{that are}} used as brackets {{for the support of}} electrical equipment such as connector strips (raceways). The same straps supporting electrical equipment may also connect the two-pipe arrangement of a truss <b>batten.</b> The center-to-center <b>spacing</b> of electric truss pipe, often from 1.5 to 2.5 ft, is typically greater than for a standard truss batten to allow for the proper mounting and focusing of lighting instruments. It is typical for an electric batten to support thousands of pounds of live load.|$|R
50|$|The {{hotel is}} a good {{regional}} example of a large timber interwar hotel that demonstrates the principal characteristics of its type. Built to provide comfortable accommodation for tourists, its original form and layout is legible and it retains many features including its lounge and coffee room (ballroom) space and evidence of its bars, parlours and retail facilities on the ground floor. On the first floor it retains: largely intact bedrooms, each with wash basin, opening off a central hall and onto wide verandahs; separate male and female bathroom facilities off the rear verandah; and a central guest lounge. Decorative features include ornamental plaster ceilings in the public ground floor <b>spaces,</b> <b>battened</b> sheet ceilings {{to the first floor}} rooms and generously sized timber joinery including built-in cabinets.|$|R
50|$|A narrow {{straight}} {{flight of stairs}} runs from the first floor landing to a small landing in the roof area which is lit by a small skylight. It provides access to two rooms, one to the front (south) side and one to the rear (north) side. The room to the front is lined with wide timber boarding, and has a centrally placed 6 over 6 timber vertical sash window in the gable end. A small access door to the roof space reveals closely <b>spaced</b> <b>battens</b> to the rafters, providing clear evidence that the roof originally had timber shingles. The room to the rear is L-shaped. It has a chimney, but no fireplace, and a single timber sash window to the gable. Walls and ceiling are lined with timber boarding.|$|R
5000|$|The {{function}} of a typical line set is to fly (raise and lower) a slender beam (typically a steel pipe) known as a batten (or a bar in the UK) by hoisting it with lift lines (typically synthetic rope or steel cable). By hanging scenery, lighting, or other equipment to a batten, they in turn may also be flown. A batten {{is said to be}} [...] "flying in" [...] when it is being lowered toward the stage, and [...] "flying out" [...] when it is being raised into the fly <b>space.</b> <b>Battens</b> may be just a few feet in length or may extend from one wing (side) of the stage to the other. A batten is suspended from above by at least two lift lines, but long battens may require six or more lift lines.|$|R
5000|$|Kitawah is a {{large and}} {{imposing}} timber house, high-set on stumps with extensive verandahs and a massive hipped roof covered with Marseilles pattern terracotta tiles. The house has two tall masonry chimneys with high level openings and a skirt of timber <b>battens</b> infilling the <b>spaces</b> between the posts. Much of the garden setting is intact, Kitawah {{is located at the}} back of the large block with driveways to both sides. The front of the block {{is a large}} levelled and grassed area that was formerly a tennis court. The entry staircase is a prominent feature of this elevation, along with a large weatherboard gable with a bold decorative screen in the plane of the bargeboards. Stairs from two sides arrive on a central landing and then a single stair leads to the front verandah, the landing is covered with a simple timber pergola and post and beam-style timber [...] "arches" [...] mark the bottom of the staircases.|$|R
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with wind tunnel testing of an elastic membrane wing intended for micro air vehicles. Erratic flow conditions are a particular problem for the smooth controllability of such vehicles, and so stiff batten structures are imbedded into {{the trailing edge of}} the membrane wing, intended to passively washout under aerodynamic loading. This passive deformation is not always effective however, particularly at higher angles of attack, and so this work is intended to provide some understanding of the complex role of wing structure and flight speed upon aerodynamic performance of membrane wings. Several disparate wing structures are fabricated, with varying <b>batten</b> thicknesses and <b>spacing.</b> Data, in terms of measured aerodynamic loads and structural deformation, is given {{for a wide range of}} relatively low Reynolds numbers. Drastic changes in lift slopes, stalling conditions, and deformation patterns are found for certain combinations of flight speed and wing structure.

50|$|The first {{room at the}} westernmost end of the {{building}} {{is used as a}} laundry and the framing of the walls, and the roof as there is no ceiling, is visible here. The wall studs are housed or notched directly into the end rafter and there is a ridge beam and widely <b>spaced</b> <b>battens.</b> Openings have been made into the shared walls to allow Room Numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5 (refer sketch plan drawing below) to operate as a flat for the owner of the barracks building, containing bath, bed, and living rooms as well as a kitchen. The walls and ceilings of all twelve rooms in the barracks are clad in fibrous cement sheeting. Those on the northern and southern sides have timber cover strips. Those shared are single-skin, with exposed timber framing decorated with rounded cover strips, on each face. Any later openings between rooms have been kept within this framing grid, where the single horizontal rail is approximately 1.8 metres from the floor. Room Numbers 10, 11 and 12 have been joined in a similar way with a small store room having been installed at the easternmost end of the verandah. In addition Room Numbers 8 and 9 have been joined. The internal linings, rails and cover strips have been painted.|$|R
40|$|Recent extreme wind {{events such}} as {{tropical}} cyclones and severe storms have shown that thin steel roof battens fail prematurely at their screw connections to the rafters or trusses. The screw heads connecting the bottom flanges of thin steel roof battens to the rafters or trusses often pull through the roof batten bottom flanges. Since such localised pull-through failures occur in the lower level of roof connections, they often cause {{the loss of the}} entire roofing system during extreme wind events. Therefore detailed experimental and numerical studies were conducted at the Queensland University of Technology, and suitable test, design and strengthening methods were developed to accurately design the roof batten to rafter/truss connections and to enhance the roof batten performances under wind uplift loads. However, the levels of possible damages at community level due to the pull-through failures of roof battens are still unknown. Therefore fragility curves were developed in this study to determine the likely level of roof damage during extreme wind events, based on the governing pull-through failures of thin steel roof battens. Detailed probabilistic analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted for this purpose. Fragility curves were also used to evaluate the effects of roof <b>batten</b> span and <b>spacing</b> and, levels of enhancement that could be achieved with the strengthening method proposed for roof battens. This paper presents the details of this study on the development of fragility curves and the results...|$|R
40|$|Three-legged truss columns {{are basic}} {{structural}} components of many envisioned large outer-space structures. They constitute three longerons ('legs') forming, {{in the column}} cross-section, the vertices of an equiliateral triangle. Their longerons are held together by uniformly <b>spaced</b> <b>battens</b> while a shear web, usually made of diagonals, restrains shear deformation. This work deals with configurations characterized by having relatively stiff battens, longerons which are pinned to the battens and prestressed string diagonals. Considered are only simply-supported slender columns having slender longeron segments and relatively thin and lightly preloaded diagonals. The columns are allowed to have global (overall) {{as well as local}} (longeron segment) geometrical imperfections - not necessarily small ones. Investigated is the static structural behavior of such columns when loaded by purely axial compressive concentrated forces acting at the supports. Addressed are the topics of global and local buckling, post-buckling, imperfection sensitivity, global-local mode interaction, complete non-linear response, limit loads and diagonals slackening and post-slackening. The approach is a theoretical one; a system of non-linear, ordinary differential equations is set up which represents the column, and results, mostly in closed form, are obtained by solving that system for a variety of cases of varying generality. First, a highly idealized case is studied in detail, in which the diagonals are removed and infinite shear rigidity is postulated instead. The results exhibit most of the essential features of the more complicated cases. Next, the case of the undeflected or only-slightly deflected column is considered. Results include the prebuckling behavior, slackening and local buckling loads, global buckling load, initial post-buckling behavior and imperfection sensitivities. Diagonals slackening in a deflecting column is studied next. This is done by means of slackening loci constructed in the load-deflection plane. Solutions are obtained for some special cases of a deflecting column. These include a complete analysis of the locally-perfect case and the cases of small load and high defection. Also obtained is an engineering-oriented load-deflection working relation valid for the most general case but based on generalization rather than on rigorous solution. A torsion-compression mode, dominant in post-slackening, is also analyzed. The work is concluded by investigating the error committed in treating continuous longerons as if they were discontinuous-pinned...|$|R
