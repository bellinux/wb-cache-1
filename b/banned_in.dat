40|$|Introduction Smoking {{rates among}} the general {{population}} and among youth are decreasing in Greece. Low compliance with smoke-free legislation in indoor places in Greece renders non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke, especially when frequenting bars. The aim {{of the current study}} was to identify the factors related to support for smoking <b>bans</b> <b>in</b> bars in Greece. Methods A cross-sectional secondary data analysis was conducted on the 2013 Greek Global Adult Tobacco Survey. Multivariate regression was used to analyze individual factors and their relation to support for the smoking <b>ban</b> <b>in</b> bars. The total sample was nationally representative of the Greek population and included 3961 residents over the age of 15 with 2061 supporting a <b>ban</b> <b>in</b> bars. Results Overall, 50. 5 % (95 % CI: 46. 5 - 54. 4) of Greeks supported the smoking <b>ban</b> <b>in</b> bars. Among them, 1, 832 (74. 9 %, 95 % CI= 70. 1 - 79. 1) were non-smokers and 229 (13. 7 %, 95 % CI= 10. 6 - 17. 5) were smokers. Age over 65 years was significantly related to increased support for the smoking <b>ban</b> <b>in</b> bars compared to those aged 15 - 24 years (p< 0. 05). Belief that secondhand smoke causes lung cancer was significantly related (p< 0. 001) to having increased support for the ban. Increased knowledge of smoking-related harm was significantly related to increased support for the <b>ban</b> <b>in</b> bars (p< 0. 001). Male non-smokers were significantly less likely to support the <b>ban</b> <b>in</b> bars than females (p< 0. 05). Conclusions Increasing knowledge and awareness of smoking-related harm will enhance smoking ban support and compliance, improving tobacco prevention and cessation, especially among the youth and young adults...|$|R

Further, enacting a similar <b>ban</b> <b>in</b> China is not only unrealistic, but also would increase the illegal trade and, therefore, the slaughter of elephants in Africa.

Part II presents the domestic legal and policy implications of an ivory ban, and analyzes the potential difficulties with implementing a similar <b>ban</b> <b>in</b> China. Part III argues that while the United States should stringently regulate the domestic ivory market, a near-complete ban is unreasonable. Further, a similar <b>ban</b> <b>in</b> China is not a practical solution; Chinese officials must consider strategies to optimize existing laws and gain public support...|$|R

5|$|Belugas {{were the}} first whales {{to be kept in}} captivity. Other species were too rare, too shy, or too big. The first beluga was shown at Barnum's Museum in New York City in 1861. For most of the 20th century, Canada was the {{predominant}} source of wild belugas. They were taken from the St. Lawrence River estuary until the late 1960s, after which they were predominantly taken from the Churchill River estuary until capture was <b>banned</b> <b>in</b> 1992. Russia has become the largest provider since it had been <b>banned</b> <b>in</b> Canada. Belugas are caught in the Amur River delta and their eastern coast, and then are either transported domestically to aquariums or dolphinariums in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Sochi, or exported to other countries, such as Canada. Most captive belugas are caught in the wild, since captive-breeding programs are not very successful.|$|E
