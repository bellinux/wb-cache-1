40|$|Abstract Background In the past, {{pedigree}} {{relationships were}} used to control and monitor inbreeding because genomic relationships among selection candidates were not available until recently. The {{aim of this study}} was to understand the consequences for genetic variability across the genome when genomic information is used to estimate <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> and in managing the inbreeding generated in the course of selection on genome-enhanced estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> Methods These consequences were measured by genetic gain, pedigree- and genome-based rates of inbreeding, and local inbreeding across the genome. Breeding schemes were compared by simulating truncation selection or optimum contribution selection with a restriction on pedigree- or genome-based inbreeding, and with selection using estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> based on genome- or pedigree-based BLUP. Trait information was recorded on full-sibs of the candidates. Results When the information used to estimate <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> and to constrain rates of inbreeding were either both pedigree-based or both genome-based, rates of genomic inbreeding were close to the desired values and the identical-by-descent profiles were reasonably uniform across the genome. However, with a pedigree-based inbreeding constraint and genome-based estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> genomic rates of inbreeding were much higher than expected. With pedigree-instead of genome-based estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> the impact of the largest QTL on the <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> was much smaller, resulting in a more uniform genome-wide identical-by-descent profile but genomic rates of inbreeding were still higher than expected based on pedigree relationships, because they measure the inbreeding at a neutral locus not linked to any QTL. Neutral loci did not exist here, where there were 100 QTL on each chromosome. With a pedigree-based inbreeding constraint and genome-based estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> genomic rates of inbreeding substantially exceeded the value of its constraint. In contrast, with a genome-based inbreeding constraint and genome-based estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> marker frequencies changed, but this change was limited by the inbreeding constraint at the marker position. Conclusions To control inbreeding, it is necessary to account for it on the same basis as what is used to estimate <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> i. e. pedigree-based inbreeding control with traditional pedigree-based BLUP estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> and genome-based inbreeding control with genome-based estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{national}} evaluations, direct genomic <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> can {{be considered}} as correlated traits to those for which phenotypes are available for traditional estimation of <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> For this purpose, estimates of the accuracy of direct genomic <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> expressed as genetic correlations between traits and their respective direct genomic <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> are required. Methods We derived direct genomic <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for 2239 registered Limousin and 2703 registered Simmental beef cattle genotyped with either the Illumina BovineSNP 50 BeadChip or the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip. For the 264 Simmental animals that were genotyped with the BovineHD BeadChip, genotypes for markers present on the BovineSNP 50 BeadChip were extracted. Deregressed estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> were used as observations in weighted analyses that estimated marker effects to derive direct genomic <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for each breed. For each breed, genotyped individuals were clustered into five groups using K-means clustering, with the aim of increasing within-group and decreasing between-group pedigree relationships. Cross-validation was performed five times for each breed, using four groups for training and the fifth group for validation. For each trait, we then applied a weighted bivariate analysis of the direct genomic <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> of genotyped animals from all five validation sets and their corresponding deregressed estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> to estimate variance and covariance components. Results After minimizing relationships between training and validation groups, estimated genetic correlations between each trait and its direct genomic <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 0. 39 to 0. 76 in Limousin and from 0. 29 to 0. 65 in Simmental. The efficiency of selection based on direct genomic <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> relative to selection based on parent average information ranged from 0. 68 to 1. 28 in genotyped Limousin and from 0. 51 to 1. 44 in genotyped Simmental animals. The efficiencies were higher for 323 non-genotyped young Simmental animals, born after January 2012, and ranged from 0. 60 to 2. 04. Conclusions Direct genomic <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> show promise for routine use by Limousin and Simmental breeders to improve the accuracy of predicted genetic merit of their animals at a young age and increase response to selection. Benefits from selecting on direct genomic <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> are greater for breeders who use natural mating sires in their herds than for those who use artificial insemination sires. Producers with unregistered commercial Limousin and Simmental cattle could also benefit from being able to identify genetically superior animals in their herds, an opportunity that has in the past been limited to seed stock animals. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this work was to study the impact of both the size of genomic {{reference}} populations and {{the inclusion of a}} residual polygenic effect on dairy cattle genetic evaluations enhanced with genomic information. Methods Direct genomic values were estimated for German Holstein cattle with a genomic BLUP model including a residual polygenic effect. A total of 17, 429 genotyped Holstein bulls were evaluated using the phenotypes of 44 traits. The Interbull genomic validation test was implemented to investigate how the inclusion of a residual polygenic effect impacted genomic estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> Results As the number of reference bulls increased, both the variance of the estimates of single nucleotide polymorphism effects and the reliability of the direct genomic values of selection candidates increased. Fitting a residual polygenic effect in the model resulted in less biased genome-enhanced <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> and decreased the correlation between direct genomic <b>values</b> and estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> of sires in the reference population.

Five-fold cross validation was performed to assess the ability of models to estimate <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for animals in generation 3.

Correlations between <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> estimated on full data and on subsets for the "leave-out" animals varied between 0. 77 – 0. 99.

Highest correlations and most unbiased results were obtained when SNP markers were joined into haplotypes.

40|$|Abstract Background It is {{commonly}} assumed that prediction of genome-wide <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> in genomic selection {{is achieved by}} capitalizing on linkage disequilibrium between markers and QTL but also on genetic relationships. Here, we investigated the reliability of predicting genome-wide <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> based on population-wide linkage disequilibrium information, based on identity-by-descent relationships within the known pedigree, {{and to what extent}} linkage disequilibrium information improves predictions based on identity-by-descent genomic relationship information. Methods The study was performed on milk, fat, and protein yield, using genotype data on 35 706 SNP and deregressed proofs of 1086 Italian Brown Swiss bulls. Genome-wide <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> were predicted using a genomic identity-by-state relationship matrix and a genomic identity-by-descent relationship matrix (averaged over all marker loci). The identity-by-descent matrix was calculated by linkage analysis using one to five generations of pedigree data. Results We showed that genome-wide <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> prediction based only on identity-by-descent genomic relationships within the known pedigree was as or more reliable than that based on identity-by-state, which implicitly also accounts for genomic relationships that occurred before the known pedigree. Furthermore, combining the two matrices did not improve the prediction compared to using identity-by-descent alone. Including different numbers of generations in the pedigree showed that most of the information in genome-wide <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> prediction comes from animals with known common ancestors less than four generations back in the pedigree. Conclusions Our results show that, in pedigreed breeding populations, the accuracy of genome-wide <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> obtained by identity-by-descent relationships was not improved by identity-by-state information. Although, in principle, genomic selection based on identity-by-state does not require pedigree data, it does use the available pedigree structure. Our findings may explain why the prediction equations derived for one breed may not predict accurate genome-wide <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> when applied to other breeds, since family structures differ among breeds. </p...|$|R

40|$|Selecting {{potential}} parental {{lines that}} {{are characterized by}} a superior genetical disposition is an essential requirement in breeding self-pollinating crops. Flawed decisions in parental selection will have major consequences for breeding success. Currently, in breeding programs for self-pollinating crops, data is collected from several sources: observations from field experiments, molecular marker data analysis and pedigree information.

However, including all available information in the statistical analysis could enhance the selection response. The prediction of <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> using best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), which was introduced by Henderson (1984) in animal breeding, is a powerful method for estimating the true genetical disposition of individuals.

The accuracy of genomic selection {{was defined as the}} correlation between estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> calculated using phenotypic data, and genomic <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> The Holstein and Jersey populations were from Australia, whereas the Fleckvieh population (dual-purpose Simmental) was from Austria and Germany. Both a BLUP with a multi-breed genomic relationship matrix (GBLUP) and a Bayesian method (BayesA) were used to derive the prediction equations. The hypothesis tested was that having a multi-breed reference population increased the accuracy of genomic selection. Minimal advantage existed of either GBLUP or BayesA multi-breed genomic evaluations over single-breed evaluations. However, when the goal was to predict genomic <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for a breed with no individuals in the reference population, using 2 other breeds in the reference was generally better than only 1 breed...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} stage of pregnancy on estimates of <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for milk yield and milk persistency in Gyr and Holstein dairy cattle in Brazil. Test-day milk yield records were analyzed using random regression models {{with or without the}} effect of pregnancy. Models were compared using residual variances, heritabilities, rank correlations of estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> of bulls and cows, and number of nonpregnant cows in the top 200 for milk yield and milk persistency. The estimates of residual variance and heritabilities obtained with the models with or without the effect of pregnancy were similar for the two breeds. Inclusion of the effect of pregnancy in genetic evaluation models for these populations did not affect the ranking of cows and sires based on their predicted <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for 305 -day cumulative milk yield. In contrast, when we examined persistency of milk yield, lack of adjustment for the effect of pregnancy overestimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> of nonpregnant cows and cows with a long days open period and underestimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> of cows with a short days open period. We recommend that models include the effect of days of pregnancy for estimation of adjustment factors for the effect of pregnancy in genetic evaluations of Dairy Gyr and Holstein cattle...|$|R
