5|$|In , the Dodgers {{moved from}} the Los Angeles Coliseum, which had a 250-foot left field line, to pitcher-friendly Dodger Stadium. The new park had a large foul {{territory}} and a comparatively poor hitting background. Koufax was an immediate <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> change, lowering his home ERA from 4.29 to 1.75. On June 30 against the expansion New York Mets, Koufax threw his first no-hitter. In the first inning of that game, Koufax struck out three batters on nine pitches to become the sixth National League pitcher and the 11th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish a nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning. With the no-hitter, a 4-2 record, 73 strikeouts, and a 1.23 ERA for June, he was named Major League Baseball Player of the Month Award. It {{would be the only}} time in his career he earned this distinction.|$|E

In the Kentucky Derby he finished fourth, and then, at 13-1 odds, {{went on to win}} the Preakness Stakes on May 21, 2011.

He was retired in 2012 after winning the Clark Handicap in November and currently stands at Darby Dan Farm.|$|E
50|$|Although the Magna Carta is {{commonly}} {{regarded as the}} very first charter giving rise to medieval European constitutionalism, <b>the</b> Charter <b>of</b> Kortenberg {{appears to have been}} far more democratic in nature. This mainly because <b>the</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Magna Carta were only the barons while <b>the</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Charter <b>of</b> Kortenberg included all citizens, expressly 'the rich and the poor' (riken ende armen).|$|R

5|$|Though Stewart {{was named}} the most {{valuable}} player for the Volunteers, multiple Tennessee players had statistically significant games. Volunteer quarterback Peyton Manning finished the game having completed 12 of his 19 pass attempts for 189 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Backup Tennessee quarterback Brandon Stewart completed all three of his pass attempts, accumulating 49 yards in the process. Tennessee receiver Joey Kent was the primary <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Volunteer passing attack, leading all receivers during the game with six receptions for 116 yards. Tennessee's passing touchdowns went to Kendrick Jones, who also had 37 receiving yards and 76 rushing yards; and Marcus Nash, who caught three passes for 54 yards.|$|E
5|$|A few modern {{historians have}} {{considered}} murder as an option. Alison Weir has tentatively suggested William Cecil as organizer of Amy Dudley's {{death on the}} grounds that, if Amy was mortally ill, he had the strongest murder motive {{and that he was}} the main <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ensuing scandal. Against this idea {{it has been argued that}} he would have risked damaging neither Elizabeth's reputation nor his own position. The notion of Sir Richard Verney killing Amy Robsart after long and fruitless efforts to poison her (with and without his master's knowledge) has been revived by George Bernard and by Chris Skidmore on the basis that Verney appears in both the c.1563 chronicle by John Hales (also called Journal of Matters of State) and the 1584 libel Leicester's Commonwealth. This coincidence has as often been evaluated as no more than a tradition of gossip, poison being a stock-in-trade accusation in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|May 9 {{was one of}} {{two times}} Young came within an inning of a shutout by {{pitching}} eight scoreless innings; August 17 against the Cleveland Indians was the other. Young recorded a personal-best eight strikeouts in a seven-inning no-decision on June 2 at Detroit. The closest Young came to a no-hitter was 5⅔ innings of hitless pitching in a road game against the Houston Astros on June 25 before allowing a Craig Biggio single in the sixth inning. Over the course of the season, Young was the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second-highest run support in the majors, trailing only David Wells of the Boston Red Sox. However, he surrendered three runs or less in 22 of 31 starts. After a 2005 season when he went 5–0 with a 3.47 ERA in 11 games during the day and 7–7 with a 4.71 ERA in 20 games at night, he had a career 8–1 record with a 3.31 ERA in 15 day games and 7–8 with a 5.05 mark in 23 games at night.|$|E

5|$|Franklin County, {{which has}} elected Kilroy twice, makes up 87% of the 15th Congressional {{district}}. The 2006 race in Ohio's 15th district gained significant national attention {{as it was}} seen {{as one of a}} handful of seats that Democrats had an opportunity to gain from Republicans. As of mid-October, the race was generally considered to be a toss-up largely due to incumbent Representative Pryce's leadership in the Republican Party. Pryce had not had a close contest since her first election in 1992 and had garnered 10% more of the vote than George W. Bush in 2004. However, Pryce was vulnerable due to Ohio Republican Party (Bob Taft and Bob Ney) scandals, the lagging Ohio economy, her association with controversial Dennis Hastert and Mark Foley, and backlash to Republican support of the Iraq War. Another Ohio Republican scandal in the minds of Ohio voters during the 2006 campaign was the Coingate scandal. Pryce and the Republicans had to keep conservative independent, Charles Morrison, off the ballot to have their best shot at success. A month before the election, Pryce was 12points behind Kilroy. On the eve of the election, some experts, such as Time, considered Pryce the underdog. Kilroy was expected to be the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decade-long migration of conservative voters to suburbs outside of the district.|$|E
