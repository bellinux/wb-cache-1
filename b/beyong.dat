The device not only makes it possible to assess the motion of a solid body forced to slide along closed trajectories across an anisotropic surface but also to directly characterize the frictional force. We made use of the device to measure independently the two components of the frictional force, one tangent to the slider velocity which thus contributes to dissipation, the other perpendicular to the slider velocity which thus does not contribute to dissipation. Moreover, we showed that the perpendicular component is indeed the derivative, with respect to the sliding direction, of the tangential component, even when the anisotropy is large and exhibits a complex pattern <b>beyong</b> the sinusoidal modulation studied previously. Finally, having characterized the frictional force, we determined the resulting slider trajectory in a specific geometry of the driving and observed an excellent agreement with the theoretical trajectory based on the expression of the friction force.

40|$|Abstract: The major {{contribution}} to the anisotropy of {{the temperature of the}} Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation is believed to come from the interaction of linear density perturbations with the radiation previous to the decoupling time. Assuming a standard thermal history for the gas after recombination, only the gravitational field produced by the linear density perturbations present on a Ω = 1 universe can generate anisotropies at low z (these anisotropies would manifest on large angular scales). However, secondary anisotropies are inevitably produced during the nonlinear evolution of matter at late times even in a universe with a standard thermal history. Two effects associated to this nonlinear phase can give rise to new anisotropies: the time-varying gravitational potential of nonlinear structures (Rees-Sciama RS effect) and the inverse Compton scattering of the microwave photons with hot electrons in clusters of galaxies (Sunyaev-Zeldovich SZ effect). These two effects can produce distinct imprints on the CMB temperature anisotropy. We discuss the amplitude of the anisotropies expected and the relevant angular scales in different cosmological scenarios.

The contingent, fragmented and sometimes contradictory positions of haemoglobinopathy counsellors are highlighted as possible examples of these insights. Sociological analysis of the professions is itself amenable to deconstruction which suggest that critiques of the professions which only identify the (very real) repressive tendencies of professional work are in danger of oversimplification and neglect other tendencies within professional roles.

Te prevent degradation of the water resources <b>beyong</b> useful limits, pollution inputs from additional uses must be quite accurately predicted prior to implementation of the new use. The model described in this report was formulated to provide the required predictive capability for the Bear River Basin. Modeling concepts of the hydrologic system are based upon the development of basin relationships describing the hydrologic processes which are linked together by the countinuity-of-mass principle. The salinity flow system is then linked to the hydrologic system based on the assumtion that the various hydrolgoci processes change the chemical concentration in the system by storing, concentrating, diluting, and/or picking up additional salts. These processes are identified specifically for irrigated soils and for small storage reservoirs. The amount of storage dilution, concentration or additional pickup is specified during verification of the model. The system response is then used to predict future responses resulting from additional water resource uses. In this study the model was sythesized on the hybrid computer and applied to the Cache Valley subbasin of the Bear River basin. The ability of the model to predict increased salt concentrations is demonstrated. A method for estimating and filling data gaps is also briefly discussed...|$|E

This survey is the first analysis of the combined distribution of both species and associated morphological characters within the family Phytoseiidae. It reveals the great utility of taxonomic data compilation and associated databases for aspects <b>beyong</b> alpha-taxonomy. The highest number of species of Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) was reported from the East Palearctic region and the lowest from the Neotropical province.

High endemism levels were observed in all the provinces considered, even those where only few species were reported (especially the Neotropical province).

40|$|Lever {{pressing}} of squirrel monkeys postponed brief {{electric shock}} {{according to a}} free-operant shock-postponement procedure. Pressing also produced shock with a probability proportional to {{the duration of the}} current interresponse time in some conditions, or to the fifth ordinally-preceding interresponse time in others. These conditions provided equal frequencies and temporal distributions of response-produced shocks either contingent on or independent of the current interresponse-time duration, respectively. Shock delivered contingent on the current interresponse-time duration resulted in shorter mean interresponse times and higher overall response rates that shock delivered independent of the current interresponse time. In subsequent conditions, response-produced shocks were sufficient to maintain responding following suspension of the postponement procedure only when those shocks were contingent on the current interresponse time. Presenting shock independent of the current interresponse time, conversely, suppressed response rate and ultimately led to cessation of responding {{in the absence of a}} conjoint shock-postponement procedure. These results demonstrate interresponse-time punishment in the absence of any indirect avoidance contingencies based on overall shock-frequency reduction, and strongly support similar interpretation at the more local level of shock-frequency reduction correlated with particular interresponse times. Differential punishment of long interresponse times also provides both an a priori basis for predicting whether a schedule of shock presentation will maintain or suppress responding and a framework for interpreting many of the functional relations between overall response rate and parameters of consequent shock presentation.

The typology for a hospice is one that is both complex and evolving. It must combine the domestic scale of a home with the efficiency and standardization of an institution. The contemporary hospice must also accommodate rituals and beliefs surrounding the end of life that vary greatly from the many cultures that make up the contemporary city.

40|$|Abstract. A {{keloid scar}} is an {{overgrowth}} of dense fibrous tissue that develops around a wound. These scars are raised scars that spread <b>beyong</b> {{the margins of}} the orinigal wound to normal skin by invasion. Keloid tissue consists of both an epithelium and dermal fibroblasts. Recent studies have primarily focused on keloid fibroblasts; however, the precise role of keratinocytes in the invasion process of keloids remains to be identified. Hypoxia is a typical characteristic of keloid scars, as well as other solid tumors. The expression of the transcription factor, hypoxia‑inducible factor‑ 1 α (HIF- 1 α), is mainly induced by hypoxia and is known for its ability to induce proliferative and transformative changes in cells; its expression has been shown to correlate with tumor invasion and metastasis. In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry, fluorescence staining and western blot analysis and demonstrated that HIF‑ 1 α was highly expressed in both the epithelial layer of keloid tissue specimens and in hypoxia‑exposed keratinocytes, which suggested that the keloid keratinocytes underwent epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro. The high expression of mesenchymal markers, such as as vimentin and fibronectin was confirmed, as well as the reduced expression of E‑cadherin and zonula occludens‑ 1 (ZO‑ 1) during this process by detection at the protein and mRNA level. Moreover, siRNA targeting HIF‑ 1 α reversed the changes which had occurred in the morphology of the kera-tinocytes (cells had acquired a fibroblast‑like appearance) and suppressed the invasive ability of the keratinocytes. In conclu-sion, the present findings demonstrate that the hypoxia/HIF‑ 1 α microenvironment provides a favorable environment for keloid‑derived keratinocytes to adopt a fibroblast‑like appear-ance through EMT. This transition may be responsible for the enhanced capacity of keloid keratinocytes to invade, allowing the keloids to extend beyond the wound margin...|$|E
