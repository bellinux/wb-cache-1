25|$|Mah Nà Mah Nà (November 30, 1969) – Mahna Mahna (performed by Jim Henson) and the Snowths were {{featured}} in this song before it was repeated on The Muppet Show. A goof is seen when Jim Henson's head and arm are seen when Mahna Mahna <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the camera.|$|E
25|$|The Babylonian Talmud relates {{that the}} {{practice}} of stepping backward after the Amidah is a reminder of the practice in the Temple in Jerusalem, when those offering the daily sacrifices would walk backward from the altar after finishing. It is also compared to a student who respectfully <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his teacher.|$|E
25|$|On September 5, 2008, Todd and Marty share {{a passionate}} kiss as Todd helps her walk. He initiates the {{intimate}} contact, and viewers, {{as well as}} critics, argued that, given his sexual intimacy issues, {{it was out of}} character for him to be as sexually bold towards Marty; Marty being his rape victim had been the main source of his sexual hangups. On September 23, 2008, the show went further with intimacy between the two and had them almost engage in sex. Todd eventually <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the contact, presumably due to his conscience.|$|E

25|$|Fred {{comes down}} with an illness and is cured by Mr. Lydgate, the newest doctor in Middlemarch. Rosamond, who is well-educated and seeks {{to make a good}} match, decides to marry Lydgate and uses Fred's {{sickness}} as an opportunity to get close to the doctor. Though he initially views their relationship as pure flirtation, Lydgate <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Rosamond after discovering that the town considers them practically engaged. However, after seeing her a final time, he breaks his resolution to abandon his relationship with Rosamond and the two become engaged. At roughly the same time, Casaubon, returned from Rome, suffers a heart attack. Lydgate is brought in to deal with him and informs Dorothea that, in all likelihood, Casaubon only has around fifteen years left if he takes it easy and ceases his studies. Meanwhile, as Fred recovers, Mr. Featherstone becomes ill. On his deathbed, he reveals that he has two wills and tries to get Mary to help him destroy one. Unwilling to be mixed up in the business of his will, she refuses, and Featherstone dies with the two wills still intact.|$|E
500|$|W. L. George {{described}} the fictional Baron as a [...] "comic giant" [...] of literature, describing his boasts as [...] "splendid, purposeless lie {{born of the}} joy of life". Théophile Gautier fils highlighted that the Baron's adventures are endowed with an [...] "absurd logic pushed to the extreme and which <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> nothing". According to an interview, Jules Verne relished reading the Baron stories as a child, and used them as inspiration for his own adventure novels. Thomas Seccombe commented that [...] "Munchausen has undoubtedly achieved ... The Baron's notoriety is universal, his character proverbial, and his name as familiar as that of Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, or Robinson Crusoe." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Hed PE {{signed with}} Suburban Noize Records, {{recording}} their fifth studio album, Back 2 Base X. The album {{was intended as}} a return to the basics of rock music, and did not rely as heavily on studio enhancement as previous releases. The album was released on June 6, 2006, the same day as The Best of (həd) Planet Earth, a compilation album produced by Jive Records without the band's authorization or consent. Back 2 Base X peaked at No.12 on the Independent Albums chart, and at No.154 on the Billboard 200. Allmusic's Rob Theakston wrote that [...] "Back 2 Base X suffers from the same problems as Amerika: it tries to be conceptual in thought à la Tool and vicious in its political commentary à la Fugazi or System of a Down, but somehow falls short by sounding like an angry stoner on a soapbox. It won't win any new fans, but existing fans of (hed) pe's work won't be turning their <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the band in anger anytime soon, either." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{are easily}} more statues in Berlin {{than in any}} other city in the world, but they only unite in failing to give Berlin an artistic air. They stand in long rows on the cornices; they crowd the pediments; they poise on one leg above domes and arches; they shelter {{themselves}} in niches; they ride about on horseback; they sit or lounge on street corners or in garden walks; all with a mediocrity in the older sort which fails of any impression. If they were only furiously baroque they would be something, and it may be from a sense of this that there is a self-assertion in the recent sculptures, which are always patriotic, more noisy and bragging than anything else in perennial brass. This offensive art is the modern Prussian avatar of the old German romantic spirit, and bears the same relation to it that modern romanticism in literature bears to romance. It finds its apotheosis in the monument to Kaiser Wilhelm I., a vast incoherent group of swelling and swaggering bronze, commemorating the victory of the first Prussian Emperor in the war with the last French Emperor, and avenging the vanquished upon the victors by its ugliness. The ungainly and irrelevant assemblage of men and animals <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the imperial palace, and saves itself too soon from plunging over the border of a canal behind it, not far from Rauch's great statue of the great Frederic. To come to it from the simplicity and quiet of that noble work is like passing from some exquisite masterpiece of naturalistic acting to the rant and uproar of melodrama; and the Marches stood stunned and bewildered by its wild explosions.|$|E
