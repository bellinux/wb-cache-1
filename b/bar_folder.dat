40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to evaluating the suitability of implementing a batch-production-oriented manufacturing line. The Characteristic Curve (CC) as introduced by Deming [Deming, D. D., 1959. When to shift to straight-line production. Harvard Business Review 38, 62 - 68. ] is an efficient tool for determining the number of machines belonging to each station in single-model production lines. Because such an approach does not consider set-up times, it is inappropriate for batch-production-oriented lines. A new methodology is presented named Distributed Set-up times Characteristic Curve (DSCC) which enables application of the CC to manufacturing lines organized on a batch-production system. The innovation introduced is an analytical model able to consider frequent set-ups, such as those caused by batch switching. The importance of the proposed technique for production system designers is the speed of analysis and the possibility of avoiding simulations as presented in the case study application, where the optimal organization of a steel pipe manufacturing line is explored. Specifically, by analyzing technical and economical performance indicators, the optimal number of laser bits, curling machines, <b>bar</b> <b>folders</b> and welders belonging to manufacturing stations, along with the suggested size of production batches to be adopted, are evaluated...|$|R
