5|$|The {{original}} Ace Cafe {{was based}} on the North Circular Road. Open 24 hours a day, it catered for late-night party-goers and boy racers. It was a popular place for cars to be hot-wired and stolen, as drivers knew they could make a quick getaway. Regus founder Mark Dixon's first business on returning to Britain after an extended time aboard was a hot-dog stand on the North Circular Road, making his own buns. He grew the <b>business</b> <b>into</b> a full-time bakery which he sold in 1989 for £800,000 (now £).|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the company}} spun-off its box, locks, and packing and moving {{supplies}} <b>business</b> <b>into</b> the PS Orangeco subsidiary; Public Storage {{said this was}} done to avoid {{the risk of losing}} the company's tax-free REIT status if too large a portion of the company's business is no longer related to real estate. This frustrated institutional investors that can only invest in real estate companies and could no longer invest in the new non-real estate subsidiaries. By 1998, Public Storage had $141 million in quarterly revenues, $2 billion in assets and 1,200 facilities in 38 states. Later that year, Public Storage acquired a competing storage company called Storage Trust Realty in a $600 million transaction.|$|E

Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income. In line with the maturing PC business, in July 2013, Microsoft announced that it would reorganize the <b>business</b> <b>into</b> four new business divisions by function: Operating System, Apps, Cloud, and Devices. All previous divisions were diluted into new divisions without any workforce cuts.|$|E
5|$|The {{height of}} the East Terrace was greatly reduced and a roof was erected in the mid-1980s. This work reduced the {{capacity}} to 27,000. Hibs {{was taken over by}} a consortium led by David Duff in 1987. The new regime spent approximately £1 million on executive boxes and refurbishments, but their policy of diversifying the <b>business</b> <b>into</b> property and public houses crippled the club financially when there was an economic downturn in the late 1980s. Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer attempted a takeover of Hibs in June 1990, with the intention of merging the two major Edinburgh football clubs. The Hibs fans protested against this and Mercer was prevented from gaining the 75% shareholding that was needed to close Hibs.|$|E

5|$|Anthony first appears when he poses as {{a member}} of the Walford council to help Eddie eject a {{squatter}} from a premises that they want to move their antiques <b>business</b> <b>into.</b> He then decides to remain in Walford and helps his father set up the business. Anthony buys some candlesticks from Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), though she does not know their true value, but when Cora finds out their true value, she accuses Anthony of scamming her. Eddie sells the candlesticks for £8000, and when Tyler decides to take part in an unlicensed boxing match, Michael convinces Anthony that Tyler will win and that it would be a good idea to place a bet on him, knowing that Anthony suffers with a gambling addiction. Anthony steals £8000 from Eddie's safe, but bets on Tyler's opponent Artie Stiller (Maurice Lee), which leaves Michael unimpressed, as he has researched Artie and found out he is tough. During the fight, however, Tyler narrowly wins so Anthony has to confess to Eddie that he has lost the money. Shortly after he does, Tyler collapses and has a seizure, so is rushed to hospital. Eddie is sickened by Anthony's actions and tells him he wishes he was dying in a hospital bed, rather than Tyler. Distraught, Anthony storms out and attends a party run by Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton), culminating in him kissing her. Afterwards, Anthony returns to the hospital to learn that Tyler has been taken for a life-saving operation and is furious that Eddie was not around. Eddie then admits that his children would be better off without him. Tyler survives and recovers, but the brothers are told by Eddie that Michael set up an unfair fight to punish the family, leading Tyler and Anthony to reject Michael. Eddie then leaves Walford, leaving Tyler and Anthony the antiques business.|$|E
5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company {{was founded}} as the Sewanee Furnace Company, a small mining concern {{established}} in 1852 by Nashville entrepreneurs seeking to exploit Tennessee's rich coal reserves and the 19th century railroad boom. After losing money, {{the business was}} sold to New York investors in 1859 and reorganized as the Tennessee Coal and Rail Company, but {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War the following year saw the fleeting company repossessed by local creditors. It became Tennessee's leading coal extractor over the next decade, mining and transporting coal around the towns of Cowan and Tracy City in the Cumberland Mountains, and soon branched out into coke manufacture. This practice of both extracting and moving coal to market by building private rail tracks was not unusual at the time, as by owning the tracks that served their mines, businesses could undercut rivals at market by saving money on transportation. A Thomas O'Connor purchased the company in 1876 and expanded the <b>business</b> <b>into</b> iron manufacture in order to stimulate coke sales, building a blast furnace near Cowan. The business was subsequently renamed the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company. TCI never again changed its name, despite a later expansion into Alabama following the 1886 purchase of the Birmingham-based Pratt Coal and Iron Company. Such was the industrial importance of Alabama to TCI that in 1895, the company relocated its offices to Birmingham, relegating its native state to relative unimportance.|$|E
