25|$|Görgei was so {{angered by}} the partial failure of that days {{military}} actions (although the Hungarian advancement, they could not breach the enemy lines, deciding {{the fate of the}} battle), that he dismissed Knezić from the lead of the III. corps because of his passivity, but also Asbóth from the lead of the II. corps, although he was the only corps commander, who accomplished his tasks. Allegedly Görgei was angered of him because his troops suffered too many losses during their attack. In their place were put: Colonel József Kászonyi in the lead of the II. corps, and Colonel Károly Leiningen-Westerburg in the lead of the III. corps. While Leiningen will demonstrate to be an excellent choice, Kászonyi's appointment in the place of Asbóth, will show to be an unlucky choice. To change the corps commanders {{in the middle of a}} battle, was also a bad decision, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> worst thing was that he did not kept under a direct control and observation his corps commanders - especially the hesitating Knezić - in order to make them to move in the right moment to the battlefield. He chose to be on the battlefield to encourage his soldiers and officers, task which he accomplished with great success, turning many times the tides of the battle with his presence, personal example and words of encouragement.|$|E

After U2 guitarist the Edge worked individually with Rubin in Los Angeles, the group spent two weeks in September 2006 completing songs with the producer at Abbey Road Studios in London. Later that year, the band released two songs from these sessions on the compilation album U218 Singles: a cover of the Skids' [...] "The Saints Are Coming" [...] with Green Day, and [...] "Window in the Skies". In January 2007, lead singer Bono said U2 intended to take their next album in a different musical direction from their previous few releases. He said, [...] "We're gonna {{continue to be a}} band, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> rock will have to go; maybe the rock has to get a lot harder.

2500|$|Meanwhile, Mushroom {{was eager}} {{to connect with the}} 'new wave' in England and brought over Peter Solley, an English {{producer}} and latter-day Procol Harum member, to produce another Mushroom artist, The Sports. One night Solley saw Jo Jo Zep and the Falcons perform, and on the strength of their new song, [...] "Shape I'm In", asked to produce the group. The first single, [...] "Hit and Run", from the album, Screaming Targets, was pop reggae and reached No.12 on the charts in August 1979. Camilleri said he [...] "never thought 'Hit and Run' would do anything <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> lick was infectious enough – though as a song it was a bit stupid – but it got us a deal all over the world.

Possibly the sardine who lives near the Brittainy coast is sad and discontented because the Norwegian sardine is the proud inhabitant of a larger sea.

6000|$|... "Yes, I have {{no doubt}} you do, John; <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> {{fastenings}} have been tampered with.

It must have been done very often, for if the things had been taken in considerable quantities you would have noticed that the stock was short directly the next order came in. Now I propose we light these two lanterns I have got here, and that we go down and have a look round the hold." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Watson's nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball {{as big as}} your fist, {{which had}} been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, {{and he used to}} do magic with it. He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed everything. So I went to him that night and told him pap was here again, for I found his tracks in the snow. What I wanted to know was, {{what he was going to}} do, and was he going to stay? Jim got out his hair-ball and said {{something}} over it, and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor. It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch. Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same. Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened. But it warn't no use; he said it wouldn't talk. He said sometimes it wouldn't talk without money. I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it wouldn't pass nohow, even if the brass didn't show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every time. (I reckoned I wouldn't say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> hair-ball would take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the difference. Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball would think it was good. He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next morning you couldn't see no brass, and it wouldn't feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball. Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.|$|E
