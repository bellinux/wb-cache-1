40|$|Like all {{bodies of}} law, the public {{international}} law of trade and investment requires an enforcement mechanism. The choices {{to be made in}} designing such a mechanism are many. Parties to trade and investment agreements must decide whether to create an adjudicative body to hear complaints about alleged <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations,</b> or to rely on informal diplomacy. They must decide whether to create formal sanctions for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations,</b> or to rely on each party’s concern for its reputation, and perhaps unilateral retaliatory actions, to discourage breach. If they choose to create an adjudicative body, they must decide who has standing to bring complaints before that body. And if they choose to create a formal sanction for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations,</b> they must select the type of penalty that they will use as well as some mechanism for calibrating its magnitude. A fair amount has been written about various aspects of these issues with specific reference to international economic law, but relatively little has been written from an analytical perspective about what the law and economics literature terms the choice between public and private enforcement of law.

50|$|The {{distinction}} between indemnity and damages is subtle may be differentiated {{by considering the}} roots of the law of obligations: how can money be paid where the defendant is not at fault? The contract before rescission is voidable but not void, so, for a period of time, there is a legal contract. During that time, both parties have legal obligation. If the contract is to be voided ab initio the obligations performed must also be compensated. Therefore, the costs of indemnity arise from the (transient and performed) obligations of the claimant rather than a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> by the defendant.|$|E

40|$|Extend of {{liability}} for {{damage in the}} Commercial Code The general private legal regulation {{of liability}} for damage is stipulated in the Civil Code (hereinafter referred to as "ObčZ"). The Commercial Code (hereinafter referred to as "ObchZ") also contains some provisions regulating damages, mainly those for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contractual <b>obligations</b> and obligations prescribed by the Commercial Code. This regulation of damages shall be used in relations governed by it {{as a matter of}} priority. In order to claim damages according to the Commercial Code, all the following basic preconditions shall be met: - occurrence <b>of</b> damage - <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>obligation</b> - causal relation between occurrence <b>of</b> damage and <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>obligation</b> And at the same time - there are no circumstances excluding liability for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> The Commercial Code stipulates the liability for damage as no-fault liability. It means that the liability relation is not conditioned by fault and occurrence of the above presumptions is enough. Pursuant to s. 379 of ObchZ, "damage" means actual damage and loss profit. Both judicial practice and legal theory consider actual damage as damage to property in the form of reduction of property of an injured party {{as a result of an}} event causing damage.

5000|$|Clause 8 {{said the}} Crown would keep a freight shed in repair, where Canada Steamship’s goods were being stored. This was at St. Gabriel Basin, on a wharf {{of the inner}} harbour of Montreal. Unfortunately, while {{trying to keep the}} shed in repair with an {{oxy-acetylene}} torch, an employee started a fire and burned down the shed. He should have used a hand drill because sparks flew and lit some cotton bales. $533,584 of goods were destroyed, $40,714 belonging to Canada Steamship. Clause 7 said ‘the lessee shall not have any claim… for… damage… to… goods… being… in the said shed.’ Clause 17 said “the lessee shall at all times indemnify ... the lessor from and against all claims ... by whomsoever made ... in any manner based upon, occasioned by or attributable to the execution of these presents, or any action taken or things done ... by virtue hereof, or the exercise in any manner of rights arising hereunder.” Lord Morton of Henryton for the Privy Council said that clause 7 did not exclude negligence liability in clear enough terms and clause 17 was ambiguous and would be construed against the Crown. The Crown could realistically be said to have been strictly liable for damage to the goods (e.g. by <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> to keep the shed in repair) and were therefore negligence should not be covered. He set out these principles.(1) if a clause expressly excludes liability for negligence (or an appropriate synonym [...] ) then effect is given to that. If not, (2) ask whether the words are wide enough to exclude negligence and if there is doubt that is resolved against the one relying on the clause. If that is satisfied then (3) ask whether the clause could cover some alternative liability other than for negligence, and if it can it covers that.|$|E

40|$|Protectionist {{provisions}} of the civil nature in commercial contractual relationships The purpose of this thesis is primarily {{to answer the question}} how and to what extent can be applied in commercial-law relations protectionist {{provisions of}} the civil nature. The main aim of the thesis is to determine at which subjects can protectionist provisions fall and next the thorough identification of these provisions. The thesis also examines the issue of application of civil liability for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> in commercial contractual relationships with the consumer element, specifically liability for delay with payment of a monetary debt. The whole thesis is systematically divided into three main chapters. The first chapter serves primarily as a general introduction to the issue of deliberate protection of weaker contractual party and describes the development of protectionist provisions, where we study two developmental lines. First we study the development of European consumer law on which our law is based and next we focus on the development of Czech legislation. Exceptional attention is dedicated to the genesis of provision § 262, paragraph 4 of the Commercial Code, which we consider as crucial to our theme, becouse this provision make the penetration of civil protectionists provisions in commercial [...] ...|$|E

40|$|García Amador, {{the first}} Special Rapporteur {{on the topic}} of state responsibility, was of the view that in {{international}} law, special circumstances denote situations of exemption from the secondary rule which attaches disadvantageous consequences to <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> under any primary rule. By contrast, his successor, Roberto Ago, advanced the notion that the exceptional circumstances characterise situations of exemption from the obligations arising out of primary rules. In departure from both conceptions, James Crawford, the last Special Rapporteur on the law of state responsibility, submitted that it is only after having established that a certain course of behaviour is contrary to the terms of a prohibition that it becomes possible to enquire whether the actor had a justification for acting as he did. If affirmative, the conduct in question is to be regarded as conduct which neither conforms with the obligation nor constitutes a violation thereof. If negative, then the act amounts to an unjustified wrongdoing and accordingly forms the basis for the operation of the various disadvantageous consequences envisaged by the law of international responsibility. This contribution first examines the process of the development of the notion of exceptional circumstances in the edifice of the law of international responsibility ex delicto. It then shows that from the three competing conceptions, only that advanced by Ago proves capable of accurately accounting for the circumstances of consent, self-defence, and the legitimate application of a countermeasure. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Liability for negligent infliction of {{emotional}} distress (NIED) is often {{taken to be}} a freestanding tort, which guards our interest in emotional tranquility against careless injury. Scope of duty determinations− settling who owes a legal obligation to exercise reasonable care and to whom they owe that obligation− are paramount on this account. Gruesome accidents may traumatize hundreds and even thousands of people. Unless the duty to exercise reasonable care not to inflict emotional harm is carefully controlled, liability will be excessive. In this paper, prepared for a conference on the Restatement 3 rd of Torts, I argue that courts have come to conceptualize NIED doctrine as a doctrine of proximate cause. Proximate cause doctrine takes the existence of obligation for granted, and addresses {{the extent of the}} defendant’s liability for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation.</b> Proximate cause doctrine settles the scope of defendants’ responsibility when defendants have failed to conduct themselves as they should. When courts address NIED liability, they are asking whether and when liability for breach of an antecedently existing duty should extend to encompass the infliction {{of emotional}} harm. In accidents among strangers, the pertinent preexisting duty is the general tort obligation to exercise reasonable care in order to avoid otherwise foreseeable physical harm. Liability for emotional harm is parasitic on the prospect of physical harm. In cases where the parties have a preexisting relationship, the pertinent duties are imposed by other bodies of law (e. g., by contract law). NIED doctrine does not impose new obligations; it extends liability for breach of preexisting obligations. The prospect of excessive liability is the central threat to a flourishing body of law imposing liability for negligently inflicted emotional distress. Conceptualizing NIED liability as proximate cause disarms this threat and arms courts with doctrinal tools devised to construct an appropriate domain of liability...|$|E

40|$|The full {{protection}} and security obligation traditionally requires a State to exercise due diligence to prevent physical damage from being inflicted on foreign investments within its territory, {{and to provide}} a means of redress for aggrieved foreign investors. Recently, tribunals have expanded this application <b>of</b> the <b>obligation</b> such that States are obliged to exercise due diligence to afford legal or regulatory protection to foreign investments. Establishing a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the <b>obligation</b> involves establishing a Stateâs responsibility for its omissions. The law of State responsibility has nuances in respect <b>of</b> establishing a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> non-absolute positive <b>obligations,</b> such as this one. Evidence of the State's knowledge of the need to act, and of its capacity to act, provide the basis on which a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the <b>obligation</b> may be established. Causation is also an element of the proof <b>of</b> a <b>breach,</b> and is to be established by reference to an adequate counter-factual. The standard to which one must establish a breach is contested â as between an objective and subjective standard, or a hybrid â albeit an objective standard of due diligence is preferable. In this context, recent tribunals have fashioned diagnostics for determining a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the <b>obligation</b> which invoke concepts of legitimate expectations, and reasonableness and rationality. Using these diagnostics means that the objective standard of proof is satisfied when an investorâs legitimate expectations are frustrated by the conduct of the State, or when the State fails to act reasonably and in order to achieve rational public policy goals. These diagnostics offer a useful and workable development in the articulation of the standard of proof in relation to a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the full {{protection and}} security obligation. </p...|$|R
