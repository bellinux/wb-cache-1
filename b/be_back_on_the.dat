500|$|After his death, {{friends and}} {{coworkers}} of Blackburn {{came forward to}} compliment his pleasant character and his talent. Friends described Blackburn as having [...] "an impishness his friends came to expect." [...] Coworker Mike Prager called Reid [...] "one of the funniest and most talented journalists in the Pacific Northwest" [...] who [...] "made his job look easy, he was that good." [...] Tom Koenninger, editor of The Columbian, described Blackburn's humor as [...] "wry" [...] and sometimes [...] "acerbic", but elaborated that Blackburn was [...] "gentle, displaying aggression when {{it was necessary for}} him to get close to a subject he was photographing." [...] Commenting on her husband's dedication to photography, Fay Blackburn remarked, [...] "if Reid were alive today, he'd probably <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front line seeking to capture the latest chapter in the mountain's evolution, in spite of the risk."

[...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E

[...] Many teams were unwilling to agree to revenue sharing unless a salary cap was put in place, something which the Major League Baseball Players' Association (MLBPA) adamantly opposed.
