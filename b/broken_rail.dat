5|$|On 22 November 2012, the Land Transport Authority {{carried out}} a ground {{deployment}} exercise with SMRT to test their incident management plans {{in the event of}} a train service disruption. In total, about 135 personnel including representatives from the Singapore Police Force's Transport Command (TransCom) and SBS Transit participated in the exercise. Train service continued as per normal and commuters were not affected by the exercise. Codenamed 'Exercise Greyhound', the exercise went through the scenario of a <b>broken</b> <b>rail</b> on the East West Line at Buona Vista. SMRT had also activated their Rail Incident Management Plan.|$|E
25|$|The {{derailment}} {{was found}} to be due to a <b>broken</b> <b>rail.</b> The Ministry of Transport report criticised the maintenance of the line, especially following a recent increase of the maximum speed of trains over the route. Following the accident the maintenance of the line was improved and plans accelerated for replacing jointed track by continuous welded rail.|$|E
25|$|In early 1984, L1164 {{failed at}} Hernes Oak and {{was struck by}} the relief {{locomotive}} and withdrawn. In 1985, L1163 was involved in a derailment near Drouin after hitting a <b>broken</b> <b>rail</b> at 70mph. The locomotive dug into the ballast and rotated through 180 degrees before rolling down an embankment. Remarkably, the crew climbed from the wreckage without serious injury and the derailed passenger carriages remained upright on the embankment, avoiding loss of life and serious injury among the passengers.|$|E
25|$|Track {{circuits}} {{can detect}} some {{but not all}} <b>broken</b> <b>rails.</b> <b>Broken</b> <b>rails</b> in switches may be in parallel paths, which cannot be detected. Breaks that are not clean breaks {{from top to bottom}} of the rail also cannot be detected. Wiring at the start and finish of track circuits are connected a short distance {{from the end of the}} rails, so that there is a blind spot within which <b>broken</b> <b>rails</b> are not detected.|$|R
40|$|A multivariate {{statistical}} model {{was developed to}} improve the ability to predict the occurrence of <b>broken</b> <b>rails,</b> (aka "service failures"). <b>Broken</b> <b>rails</b> are {{the leading cause of}} major accidents on US railroads and service failures are a frequent cause of delays. The model uses a combination of engineering and traffic data commonly recorded by major railroads. The Service Failure Prediction Model (SFPM) enables railroads to identify the conditions that are predictive of the occurrence of <b>broken</b> <b>rails.</b> This can help them allocate inspection, detection and preventive resources more efficiently, thereby enhancing safety, reducing risk and service interruptions, and potentially extracting more use from their rail assets...|$|R

25|$|The {{derailment}} {{was found}} to be due to a <b>broken</b> <b>rail</b> at a rail joint, where a fatigue crack through the first bolt hole in a running-on rail had progressively developed and a triangular piece of rail had broken out. The sleeper at the joint had previously failed and been replaced with a shallower timber replacement. This replacement had not been well packed, was on a shallow layer of clean ballast and the rubber pad supporting the rail on the adjacent concrete sleeper was missing.|$|E
25|$|The {{block system}} handles all control and {{supervision}} of routes through interlockings including switch (point) control and switch status, for <b>broken</b> <b>rail</b> protection, and tracking of trains with failed (or not equipped for) CBTC. CBTC lines are fully track circuited with power frequency, single-rail track circuits. (Broken-rail protection is only guaranteed {{on one of}} the two rails, however.) Equipment aboard every train identifies the location of the train using wayside transponders as a basis. Once the Zone Controller has determined, based on track circuit information and train localization, that the CBTC train is a single discrete train ("sieved"). The Wayside Zone Controller uses this information to grant movement authorities based on conditions ahead. The CBTC Zone Controller functions then as an overlay which only provides safe separation of trains and cannot do so without interaction from the Wasyide (Legacy) Signaling system. Trains, with CBTC, can then operate closer together, although as before, platform dwell times and train performance are the true limiting factors in terms of headway performance. With the new system, signals and interlockings are still absolutely required, their job being done better by relay interlockings or Solid State Interlocking controllers. The ATS system at the Control Center is not a vital (life-safety) system and serves only to automate the routing of trains based on the overall timetable. The location of the train is also used to inform passengers of arrival times. The MTA's form of CBTC uses a reduced form of the old fixed-block signaling system, requiring that both be maintained at high cost.|$|E

2500|$|At {{approximately}} 5:49 am, an 81-car Wisconsin Central train {{traveling from}} Stevens Point, Wisconsin, to Neenah, Wisconsin, approached {{the city of}} Weyauwega at , traveling on a downward grade. The first 16 cars of the train passed a switch without incident, after which 37 cars behind them derailed {{at the location of}} the switch, at 5:49:32 AM. [...] A subsequent NTSB investigation found the cause of the derailment to be a <b>broken</b> <b>rail</b> within the switch that was the result of an undetected bolt hole fracture. [...] The derailed cars included seven tank cars of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), seven tank cars of propane and two tank cars of sodium hydroxide. The derailment ruptured three of the tank cars, spilling both LPG and propane, which immediately ignited. The conductor of the train cut the train after the first nine cars, and proceeded onward [...] He informed local law enforcement of the hazardous material the train was carrying, and was instructed to tell the fire chief.|$|E

40|$|Rolling contact fatigue (RCF) {{and wear}} are {{inevitable}} in the wheel/rail system, but resulting failures and derailments need not also be inevitable. Understanding why and under which conditions <b>broken</b> <b>rails</b> and derailments {{are likely to}} occur will focus research, inspection and maintenance efforts to minimize their probability. RCF leads to many <b>broken</b> <b>rails,</b> and rails with severe RCF damage are difficult to inspect. Wear {{on the other hand}} reduces the extent of crack growth and hence can be beneficial in some cases. On the other hand, wear changes wheel and rail profiles, may expose virgin material to contact stresses, and reduces the section strength, which may lead to higher stress from bending and torsion. These influences are explored together with case studies of operational derailments. Based on this information and {{the current state of the}} art – both theoretical and practical – a number of issues are raised which need to be addressed through further developments in understanding and mitigating strategies to reduce the risk of failures from RCF and wear...|$|R

The Glen brook bore down a freight of gold and crimson leaves, like fairy shallops. In Mr. James Reese's buckwheat stubble-land, with its beautiful tones of red and brown, a crow parliament was being held, whereat solemn deliberations regarding the welfare of crowland were in progress.

6000|$|Halleck woke {{at daybreak}} from the drowse {{into which he}} had fallen. The train was {{creeping}} slowly over the track, feeling its way, and he heard fragments of talk among the passengers about a <b>broken</b> <b>rail</b> that the conductor had been warned of. He turned to ask some question, when the pull of rising speed came from the locomotive, {{and at the same}} moment the car stopped with a jolting pitch. It settled upon the track again; but the two cars in front were overturned, and the passengers were still climbing from their windows, when Halleck got his bewildered party to the ground. Children were crying, and a woman was led by with her face cut and bleeding from the broken glass; but it was reported that no one else was hurt, and the trainmen gave their helplessness to the inspection of the rotten cross-tie that had caused the accident. One of the passengers kicked the decayed wood with his boot. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I always like a little accident like this, early; it makes us safe the rest of the day." [...] The sentiment apparently commended itself to popular acceptance; Halleck went forward with part of the crowd to see what was the matter with the locomotive: it had kept the track, but seemed to be injured somehow; the engineer was working at it, hammer in hand; he exchanged some dry pleasantries with a passenger who asked him if there was any chance of hiring a real fast ox-team in that neighborhood, in case a man was {{in a hurry to get}} on to Tecumseh.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Train {{accidents}} can {{be directly}} connected to fatal accidents-collision, derailment, Fire, railway crossing accidents-resulting in tremen-dous human casualties. First of all, the railway derailment is not only related to most of railway accidents but also {{it can lead to}} much more catastrophic accompanying train overtured than other factors. Therefore, it is most important factor to ensure railway safety. some foreign countries have applied to the detector machines(e. g., ultrasonic detector car, sleep mode, current detector, optical sensing, optical fiber). Since it was developed in order to prevent train from being derailed. In korea, the existing track method has been used to monitor rail condition using track circuit. However, we found out it impossible for Communication Based Train Control system(CBTC), recent technology to detect rail condition using balise(data transmission devices) without no track circuit. For this reason, it is needed instantly to develop real-time moni-toring system used to detect <b>broken</b> <b>rails.</b> Firstly, this paper presents domestic and international statues analysis of rail breaks technology. Secondly, the composition and the characteristics of the real-time monitoring system. Finally, the evidence that this system could assumed the location and type of <b>broken</b> <b>rails</b> was proved by the experiment of prototype and operation line tests. We concluded that this system can detec...|$|R
