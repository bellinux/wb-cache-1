2500|$|In May 2004, Gaahl again {{received}} a prison sentence, for aggravated assault. He appealed for a reduced sentence, and in February 2005 he was re-sentenced to fourteen {{months in prison}} and ordered to pay the victim 190,000 NOK (about 30,400 US$) in compensation. The incident happened in February 2002 during a late-night party at Gaahl's house in Espedal, when he became involved in a confrontation {{with a man who}} arrived at his house. Gaahl was accused of severely beating the man, collecting his blood into a cup and threatening to make him drink it. Gaahl said [...] "I {{was the one who was}} attacked, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> I punished him too hard. As I always say, when people cross my line and I let them know where the line is many steps before they cross it, and still they choose to cross it, then I will be the one to decide what their punishment will be". He also claimed to have given the man the cup [...] "so that he would not make such a mess in my house with all the blood". In March 2006, Gaahl recorded vocals for Gorgoroth's next album, Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam. According to band members, he was in prison from April to December 2006.|$|E

At {{every one of those}} concerts in England you will find rows of weary people who are there, not because they really like classical music, <b>but</b> because <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> ought to like it. Well, there is the same thing in heaven. A number of people sit there in glory, not because <b>they</b> are happy, <b>but</b> because <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> owe it to their position to be in heaven.
