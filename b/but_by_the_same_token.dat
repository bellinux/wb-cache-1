He knew from his own quaint learning that the garden arrangement was an elaborate and expensive one; he thought it extravagantly improbable that any one would pour out money like water for a joke against him. Having no explanation whatever to offer, he admitted the fact to himself, like a clear-headed man, and waited as he would have done {{in the presence of a}} man with six legs.|$|E

50|$|Natural thorium is {{essentially}} isotopically pure 232Th, {{which is the}} longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium, having a half-life comparable {{to the age of}} the universe. Its radioactive decay is the largest single contributor to the Earth's internal heat; the other major contributors are the shorter-lived primordial radionuclides, which are 238U, 40K and 235U in descending order of their size of contribution. (At the time of the Earth's formation, 40K and 235U contributed much more by virtue of their short half-lives, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>token</b> they have also decayed more quickly, leaving the almost constant contribution from 232Th and 238U predominant.)

50|$|And it is {{necessary}} to acknowledge that, for the new philosophy, there can not be dualism between certainty and security, since speculations connect those who extol it to those who one calls the enemies of society.

Truly, philosophying will become anew a dangerous occupation, as it was in heroic times. The philosophers will anew be the friends of <b>the</b> truth, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> turn, enemies of the gods, enemies of the state, and corrupters of youth. Philosophy will, anew, involve a risk. A selection will then take place.

5000|$|Huckabee {{disagrees with}} aspects of John McCain/Ted Kennedy {{immigration}} reform {{but in a}} May 16, 2006 Washington Post interview he agreed with George W.

To think that we're going to go lock up 12 million people, or even round them up and drive them to the border and let them go, might make a great political speech, but it's not going to happen. What should happen, however, is exactly what I think W. Bush has proposed, and that is that we create a process where people make restitution for the fact they have broken the law." ...|$|E
5000|$|During an {{interview}} with AfterBuzz TV Paevey revealed that the rather unconventional casting process started {{when he was just}} lounging around with his close friends and management team and one of his managers suggested that Paevey should meet with casting director Mark Teschner. Paevey revealed that when he first auditioned for the show, [...] "there was no part. They just wanted some young blood on the show." [...] The producers had the actor come in to read dummy sides quite a few times. He was brought back to audition again for executive producer Frank Valentini and other people from the network. During the audition process, he screen-tested opposite Storms and Chad Duell who played Michael Corinthos. Of his casting, Paevey said, [...] "This is my first series regular role, the first time I have a dressing room with my name on the door. I'm not an ego guy, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>token,</b> I also kind of wanted to my best to fit in quickly."

5000|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, {{political}} affiliations grew in significance and split the subculture, distancing {{the far right}} and far left strands, although many skins describe themselves as apolitical. As a movement that was highly regionalised and excluded by society's moral norms, skinhead culture sometimes attracted some violent and hard-line political elements and was eventually tainted in the mid-1980s by tabloid hysteria of fringe and violent racial elements representing extreme racism. According to Shane Meadows, [...] "It's unfortunate that the racist elements have become such a by-word for skinhead culture. The media has played its part in this, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>token</b> it's clear the fascist element has always been fairly vocal in skinhead culture. The sad bit {{is that the more}} enlightened, anti-fascist aspects have not better promoted themselves." [...] From the 1990s, the style has been adopted by disaffected, Neo-Nazi youths in the former East Germany, Spain, Finland, central European countries, and Eastern European countries such as Russia. However, many skinheads remain influenced by dissident left-wing and center-left type politics or left-wing pro-working class politics that {{have been part of the}} movement since the beginning, particularly in the U.K. and the U.S., while others continue to embrace the subculture as an apolitical working class movement.|$|E
40|$|The major {{challenge}} of econometrics is assessing {{the essentials of}} relationships between empirical phenomena, where {{this has to be}} based on data which could not be collected from controlled experiments. This calls for inference procedures which can handle both exogenous and endogenous explanatory variables. For proper interpretation of econometric inference various assumptions of a technical statistical nature should hold, whereas for some of these conditions their validity cannot be corroborated. Therefore, they simply have to be adopted, either on the basis of conventions or other often highly subjective convictions. In this note we demonstrate that some of these crucial but statistically unveri…able assumptions can be replaced by others, in order to make inferences not only more credible, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> stroke more robust, e¢ cient and accurate as well...|$|R

40|$|In my bachelor's thesis, on {{the basis}} of several case studies I examine the {{relationship}} between text and moving images in an artistic context.

At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time I attempt to ascertain the motivation of contemporary artists using the principle of "text within text". Because this pertains to works created in roughly the last ten years, I frame them within the current social discourse. This entails venturing even into non-artistic spheres, were the principle of the doubling of media is also prolific. These forays then serve as points of reference in the analysis of individual works.
