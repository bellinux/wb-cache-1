60|$|The example afforded, and the {{education}} given to the sentiments, by laying the foundation of domestic existence upon a relation contradictory to the first principles of social justice, must, from {{the very nature of}} man, have a perverting influence of such magnitude, that it is hardly possible with our present experience to raise our imaginations to the conception of so great a change for the better as would be made by its removal. All that education and civilization are doing to efface the influences on character of the law of force, and replace them by those of justice, remains merely on the surface, as long as the citadel of the enemy is not attacked. The principle of the modern movement in morals and politics, is that conduct, and conduct alone, entitles to respect: that not what men are, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> constitutes their claim to deference; that, above all, merit, and not birth, is the only rightful claim to power and authority. If no authority, not in its nature temporary, were allowed to one human being over another, society would not be employed in building up propensities with one hand which it has to curb with the other. The child would really, {{for the first time in}} man's existence on earth, be trained in the way he should go, and when he was old there would be a chance that he would not depart from it. But so long as the right of the strong to power over the weak rules in the very heart of society, the attempt to make the equal right of the weak the principle of its outward actions will always be an uphill struggle; for the law of justice, which is also that of Christianity, will never get possession of men's inmost sentiments; they will be working against it, even when bending to it.|$|E

5000|$|Anurag Kashyap said he {{had wanted}} to make a film on Bihar with the name Bihar for some time but for various reasons it didn't take off. In 2008 he met Zeishan Quadri (the writer of Gangs of Wasseypur) who told him about Wasseypur's story. He found it unreal to believe that mafia {{activity}} and gang war existed at such high level.

5000|$|But then I {{think the}} reason that celebrities would be {{interested}} is because it's a religion that fits pretty well with a celebrity kind of personality. It's very individualistic.

And then the wealth question: These aren't people who need more wealth, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> need, or often want at least, {{is some kind of}} spiritual validation for their wealth and lifestyle, and Scientology is a religion that says it's OK to be wealthy, it's OK to be famous, in fact, that's a sign of your spiritual development.

Zeishan narrated a wide panoply of stories but what really attracted him was not the gang war itself, but the bigger story of the emergence of the mafia.

50|$|Huey, Dewey and Louie are {{practicing}} their animal identification skills for {{a field trip}} with the Junior Woodchucks. This gives Donald an idea: {{he wants to see}} his nephews meet an animal they can't identify, so he can claim to have been a better scout. Donald and his nephews go on a trip to the woods to spot wild animals. Donald heads to Grandma Duck's farm, disguises various animals as fantastical creatures from his own, wild imagination, and sends them off to meet the boys. However, the boys are able to identify each of them as mythological animals. The identifications were: a Gulon, a Mi'raj, a Basilisk, a Catoblepas, a Peryton, a Shadhahvar, an Eale, and a Barometz. Frustrated at this, Donald becomes obsessed with getting to humiliate his nephews, so he runs to Grandma's farm and begins disguising her horse. However, he has mistaken Grandma's new, more sanguine horse for her old, calmer one, and when the horse kicks Donald out of annoyance, everything goes out of control. The boys expect to see perhaps a griffin or a chimaera, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> see is a complete jumble of animal parts. Having to admit that they have finally seen an animal they can't identify, the boys end their trip and head back home. The story ends with Donald claiming he can show his nephews something they certainly can't identify: a genuine rustled-feathered, broken-jacketed Duckburgian peabrain.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{effect of}} MMM crucial to life chances is work capacity; MMM shows a {{cyclical}} pattern of decreasing work capacity and its rewards, further exacerbating the problem. Allen found {{a correlation between}} reduced VO2 max rates among MMM populations and decreased muscular strength and endurance {{in the performance of}} strenuous manual labor. Although personal motivation can have a strong positive impact on individual work performance, better muscular development associated with a history of adequate nutrition increases overall work capacity, irrespective of effort. Among Jamaican cane cutters, those within normal size range cut more cane than those who showed stunting. One cultural variation in this trend was found among MMM Guatemalan workers who put forth work effort comparable to better nourished counterparts, but were likely to engage in resting behavior than in recreational or social activity during off hours. [...] In wage economies where workers get paid in proportion to productive output, reduced work capacity can translate to reduced food security, increasing the risk of MMM. [...] Additionally, malnutrition and infectious disease have a synergistic relationship that can lead to spiraling health deterioration. According to Allen, the incidence of infectious disease does not vary significantly between MMM and adequately nourished populations, but the duration and severity of disease episodes is greater for MMM populations. [...] A key reason for this disparity is that infectious disease often results in poor food intake and nutrient absorption. Not only do sick people generally eat little, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> eat is often of minimal benefit due to nausea and diarrhea.|$|E

Among the members currently are self-identified council communists, anarcho-socialists, DeLeonists, libertarian socialists, and world socialists, both with and without organised affiliations to their political positions.
