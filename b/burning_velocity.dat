The results display that the flame <b>burning</b> <b>velocities</b> of biomass gasification gases are relatively low, and they increase when adding hydrogen, which has a higher flame burning speed. Satisfying effects are achieved under different equivalence ratios, initial temperatures and pressures. Research shows that flame <b>burning</b> <b>velocities</b> improve with the fraction of hydrogen volume increasing. It also suggests that {{with the rise of}} equivalence ratio, the velocities increase first, and then decrease, and they reach the highest when equivalence ratio is stoichiometric; an increase in initial temperature accelerates the <b>burning</b> <b>velocities,</b> while the velocities drop by enhancing the pressures...|$|R

5000|$|A {{premixed}} flame is a flame formed {{under certain}} conditions during the combustion of a premixed charge (also called pre-mixture) of fuel and oxidiser. Since the fuel and oxidiser—the key chemical reactants of combustion—are available throughout a homogeneous stoichiometric premixed charge, the combustion process once initiated sustains itself by way of its own heat release. The majority of the chemical transformation in such a combustion process occurs primarily in a thin interfacial region which separates the unburned and the burned gases. The premixed flame interface propagates through the mixture until the entire charge is depleted. The propagation speed of a premixed flame {{is known as the}} flame speed (or <b>burning</b> <b>velocity)</b> which depends on the convection-diffusion-reaction balance within the flame, i.e. on its inner chemical structure. The premixed flame is characterised as laminar or turbulent depending on the velocity distribution in the unburned pre-mixture (which provides the medium of propagation for the flame).|$|E

Turbulent <b>burning</b> <b>velocity</b> was measured and the variation of flame surface characteristics due to hydrogen addition was analyzed. The {{results show that}} hydrogen addition causes an increase in turbulent <b>burning</b> <b>velocity</b> for lean premixed CH 4 -air mixtures when turbulent level in unburned mixture is not changed. Moreover, the increase of turbulent <b>burning</b> <b>velocity</b> is faster {{than that of the}} corresponding laminar <b>burning</b> <b>velocity</b> at constant equivalence ratio, suggesting that the kinetics effect is not the sole factor that results in the increase in turbulent <b>burning</b> <b>velocity</b> when hydrogen is added. The further analysis of flame surface characteristics and brush thickness indicates that hydrogen addition slightly decreases local flame surface density, but increases total flame surface area because of the increased flame brush thickness. The increase in flame brush thickness that results in the increase in total surface area may contribute to the faster increase in turbulent <b>burning</b> <b>velocity,</b> when hydrogen is added. Besides, the stretched local laminar <b>burning</b> <b>velocity</b> may be enhanced with the addition of hydrogen, which may also contribute to the faster increase rate of turbulent <b>burning</b> <b>velocity.</b> Both the variation in flame brush thickness and the enhancement in stretched local laminar <b>burning</b> <b>velocity</b> are due to the decreased fuel Lewis number when hydrogen is added.

40|$|The {{molecular}} structure of mixed hydrous and anhydrous ethanol {{with up to}} 10 %[*]v n-heptane had been studied.

The result showed that the <b>burning</b> <b>velocity</b> of hydrous ethanol is higher than anhydrous ethanol and n-heptane at stoichiometric, rich, and very rich mixtures. The <b>burning</b> <b>velocity</b> of hydrous ethanol with n-heptane drops drastically compared to the <b>burning</b> <b>velocity</b> of anhydrous ethanol with n-heptane. It is caused by two reasons.

However, in the concentration profiles, ethylene and water are consistently over-predicted by the current mechanism. Ignition delay times of ethanol and dimethyl ether have been measured in the low-pressure shock tube at NUI, Galway at varying fuel concentrations, equivalence ratios and pressures. Laminar <b>burning</b> <b>velocities</b> of ethanol in air have been measured using the flat-flame burner at the Universite de Lorraine at 358 K and 1. 0 atm. Reactions that influence the ignition delay times of ethanol and dimethyl ether include decomposition and hydrogen-abstraction reactions, while those influencing the laminar <b>burning</b> <b>velocities</b> of ethanol involve the secondary ethanol and acetaldehyde radicals.
