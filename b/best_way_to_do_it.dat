500|$|In 1996, Madonna {{starred in}} the film Evita, playing the titular role. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Eva and even {{wrote a letter to}} {{director}} Alan Parker, explaining how she would be perfect for the part. After securing the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader since Evita required the actors to sing their own parts. Lader noted that the singer [...] "had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. Evita is real musical theater— its operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had." [...] From the moment she was signed in the film, Madonna had expressed interest in recording a dance version of [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina". According to her publicist Liz Rosenberg, [...] "since [...] didn't write the music and lyrics, she wanted her signature on that song... I think on her mind, the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> was go in the studio and work up a remix".|$|E

[...] (December 1946) Writer and publisher Lloyd Arthur Eshbach reported Hubbard saying [...] "I'd like to start a religion. That's where the money is." [...] Writer Theodore Sturgeon reported that Hubbard made a similar statement at the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society. Likewise, writer Sam Moskowitz reported in an affidavit that during an Eastern Science Fiction Association meeting on November 11, 1948, Hubbard had said [...] "You don't get rich writing science fiction. If {{you want to get}} rich, you start a religion." [...] Milton A. Rothman also reported to his son Tony Rothman that he heard Hubbard make exactly that claim at a science fiction convention. In 1998, an A documentary titled [...] "Inside Scientology" [...] shows Lyle Stuart reporting that Hubbard stated repeatedly that to make money, [...] "you start a religion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite Gravano's rise {{in status}} to consigliere, Gotti {{continued}} to use Gravano for the task of murder. In May 1988, Gravano and Robert Bisaccia, a New Jersey crime family soldier, murdered Francessco Oliverri for beating a Gambino family crew member to death. Bisaccia shot Oliverri to death while Gravano waited in a stolen get-away car. After Oliverri, John Gotti had finally got around to taking care of Wilfred [...] "Willie Boy" [...] Johnson. Johnson had been a childhood friend of Gotti's and a longtime crew member while Gotti was captain of the Bergin crew. However, at Gotti's RICO trial, Diane Giacalone, the head prosecutor, revealed that Johnson had been an informant for the FBI for years. Johnson refused to testify for the prosecution. In Underboss Gravano claims that Gotti met with Johnson during the trial and informed Johnson {{that as long as}} he never testified against Gotti, he and his family would not be harmed. Johnson would never be allowed to participate in mob matters again, however. Johnson asked Gotti to swear on his dead son, Frank Gotti, who had been killed in an accident years ago. Gotti swore. Now Gotti was having second thoughts. [...] "John discussed how it should go, using me to bounce off ideas about the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> That was my only involvement," [...] Gravano explained. Johnson was shot while walking to his car to go to work {{in front of his house}} in May 1988. In 1990, Gravano was involved in two murders, the first of which was Eddie Garofalo, a demolition contractor who made the mistake of running afoul of the Gambinos. On August 9, 1990, Garofalo was shot to death in front of his home as arranged by Gravano.|$|E
