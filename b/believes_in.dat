5|$|Antoinism <b>believes</b> <b>in</b> a dualistic {{universe}} {{composed of}} a spiritual world governed by the law of God or consciousness, and of a corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence.

The view of the matter is, however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.|$|E
