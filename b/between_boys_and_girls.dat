5|$|When {{thinking}} {{on how to}} write about true love, Akahori considered laughingly that in normal relationships <b>between</b> <b>boys</b> <b>and</b> <b>girls,</b> it eventually tends towards having sex. In order to avoid this, he chose to have a cast of female main characters, but he felt that audiences have experienced this before and that it thus would not be enough. This is when he thought {{up the idea of}} changing the main character from a boy to a girl. Akahori knew this would be a problem, since normally changing a person's gender would cause complications, one of them being that the now-female character would invariably want to return to being male. He knew that there were a few problems that could not be avoided, but he wanted to remove the desire to turn back into a male. For this reason, Akahori devised that the character would not want to turn back into a male if there was the impact of the entire world already having accepted the fact that his gender had changed. To do this, Akahori decided to have the alien who crashed into the character to not only revive the character as a female, but to broadcast this over the entire world, which is what happens at the beginning of Kashimashi. Afterwards, Akahori felt it necessary to expand on the alien's role in the story. At this point in the development process, Akahori felt he could now begin writing the story.|$|E

25|$|Puberty is {{the process}} of {{physical}} changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a girl, the testes in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Physical growth—height and weight—accelerates {{in the first half of}} puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences <b>between</b> <b>boys</b> <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> are the external sex organs.|$|E

25|$|Currently Nigerian {{women are}} making many advancements within their society. In recent years, three male {{dominated}} professions, the Nigerian Medical Association, the Nigerian Bar Association and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria, have been led by female presidents. The subsequent {{creation of the}} National Commission for Women and a ministerial portfolio for Women Affairs provide additional avenues {{for the promotion of}} women's educational issues and the enhancement of {{the role of women in}} national development by way of a statutory body and a Ministry. Today, more children go to school and learn to read and write than in previous decades. As a result, younger persons are much more likely to be literate than older persons. In a survey done by the International Education Statistics measured Nigerian literacy across different 5-year age groups. Among persons aged 15 to 19 years - those who were of primary school age in the 1990s - the literacy rate is 70%. Among persons 80 years or older, only 13% are literate. Additionally, the gap <b>between</b> <b>boys</b> <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> aged 15 to 19 is only 11%.|$|E
25|$|Thinking of virginity as {{a stigma}} disempowered many boys {{because they felt}} deeply ashamed and often tried {{to hide the fact}} that they were virgins from their partners, which for some {{resulted}} in their partners teasing them and criticizing them about their limited sexual techniques. The girls who viewed virginity as a stigma did not experience this shaming. Even though they privately thought of virginity as a stigma, these girls believed that society valued their virginity because of the stereotype that women are sexually passive. This, they said, made it easier for them to lose their virginity once they wanted to because they felt society had a more positive view on female virgins and that this may have made them sexually attractive. Thinking of losing virginity as part of a natural developmental process resulted in less power imbalance <b>between</b> <b>boys</b> <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> because these individuals felt less affected by other people and were more in control of their individual sexual experience. Adolescent boys, however, were more likely than adolescent girls to view their loss of virginity as a positive aspect of their sexuality because it is more accepted by peers.|$|E
25|$|Issues {{of gender}} {{equality}} in education {{have been the}} subject of much debate during the past decades and have become a prominent topic of debate in all countries. In Nigeria, there are large disparities between the education that boys and girls receive. Many girls do not have access to adequate education past a certain age. Currently, the female adult literacy rate (ages 15 and above) for the country was 59.4% in comparison to the male adult literacy rate of 74.4%. It is differences in education that have led to this gap in literacy. According to the Central Bank of Nigeria the gender gap in literacy rates at the rural level <b>between</b> <b>boys</b> <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> was 18.3 percent in favour of the boys overall. However, in the age group 6–9 years (primary school ages) it was only 3.9 percent in favour of boys. This indicates that there is a gender dimension to educational attainment and development in Nigeria. According to the Examination Council of Nigeria (1994) there are still other problems, such as high drop-out rates of females students, poor performance, reluctance on the part of females students to enroll in science-based courses and poor classroom participation Across various geo-political delineations in Nigeria, a greater percentage of school-age girls are needlessly out-of-school, compared with the ratio applicable to boys of same age grouping.|$|E

500|$|The {{music was}} {{developed}} immediately following {{a brief period}} in the mid 1960s where creative authenticity among musical artists and consumer marketing coincided with each other. Before the progressive pop of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable {{to decide on the}} artistic content of their music. Assisted by the mid 1960s economic boom, record labels began investing in artists, giving them freedom to experiment, and offering them limited control over their content and marketing. The growing student market serviced record labels with the word [...] "progressive", being adopted as a marketing term to differentiate their product from [...] "commercial" [...] pop. Music critic Simon Reynolds writes that beginning with 1967, a divide would exist between [...] "progressive" [...] pop and [...] "mass/chart" [...] pop, a separation which was [...] "also, broadly, one <b>between</b> <b>boys</b> <b>and</b> <b>girls,</b> middle-class and working-class." [...] Before progressive/art rock became the most commercially successful British sound of the early 1970s, the 1960s psychedelic movement brought together art and commercialism, broaching the question of {{what it meant to be}} an artist in a mass medium. Progressive musicians thought that artistic status depended on personal autonomy, and so the strategy of [...] "progressive" [...] rock groups was to present themselves as performers and composers [...] "above" [...] normal pop practice.|$|E

There was a demand from existing parents, and prospective ones while Old Stopfordians with both sons and daughters were keen to take advantage of any changes to the entry.
