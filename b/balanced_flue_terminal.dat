5000|$|Balanced flueâ€”Use {{the natural}} draught {{created by the}} hot exhaust, so the flue is as short as possible, usually {{sufficiently}} long to pass through an external wall against or near which the appliance is installed. The <b>balanced</b> <b>flue</b> <b>terminal</b> has both flue outlet and air inlet in close proximity, so any draughts or wind gusts pressure both equally and cancel out in the appliance. Thus the burner flame and even pilot lights are not affected.|$|E
50|$|Valor Fires in Erdington {{developed}} the first {{radiant gas fire}} in 1967, a <b>balanced</b> <b>flue</b> fire in 1973, and a natural flame gas fire in 1978. The Erdington site, owned by Iceland's BDR Thermea, closed in May 2012. The company also built gas cookers; since 2011 {{the company has been}} part of Glen Dimplex, who have a site at Cooper's Bank, south of Gornalwood.|$|R
50|$|They further {{state that}} all tanks must be {{installed}} on a surface {{strong enough to}} support a full storage tank. The surface must be flat, even and fire-resistance, and should extend at least 300mm {{beyond the boundaries of}} the tank. A paving stone surface must be at least 42mm thick, and a concrete surface must be at least 100mm thick. The document also states that the tank should be situated at least 1800mm away from any potential hazards, such as doors, windows, appliance <b>flue</b> <b>terminals,</b> non-fire rated buildings such as garden fences, and at least 760mm from non-fire rated smaller structures such as wooden fences.|$|R
50|$|In {{domestic}} heating systems with pilot lights {{it has been}} estimated that half of the total energy usage is from the pilot light, with each pilot light on average using between 70 and 500 watts of gas power (between 8 and 16 gigajoules/year). The heat from a pilot light in many appliances (furnaces, space heaters, water heaters) is generally released in the same chamber as the primary burner.The energy loss is much smaller for pilot lights in space heaters than other products, because space heaters heat a smaller enclosed space and contribute more significantly to heating the room. The appliance efficiency of a gas fired <b>balanced</b> <b>flue</b> local space heater in pilot light mode is almost equal with the appliance efficiency measured at the reduced power of the appliance, which efficiency is between 65 - 95% based on the low calorific value of the consumed gas, making part of the pilot lights energy consumption into a useful heat.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} is in two parts, the first part {{describes}} an investigation that was undertaken to determine the feasibility and hydrodynamic behaviour of a cold model circulating fluidized bed system proposed for the continuous combustion-gasification of biomass. The design {{is based on the}} principle that the char produced in the gasifier is circulated with the bed material and combusted in a separate reactor to generate the heat required for the gasification process. While high solid circulation rates are required to maintain the heat <b>balance,</b> product and <b>flue</b> gas mixing between the two units must be minimised or eliminated. The design of the circulating bed simply consists of two fluid bed units connected two together via a riser and a downcomer fitted with a non-mechanical valve. Various aspects such as solid circulation rate, gas mixing, solids mixing, and pressure component around the circulating ioop were studied. Results show that the solid circulation and gas mixing are strongly influenced by the riser gas velocity, total solids inventory, and position of the riser from the riser gas jet. Solid circulation fluxes of up to 1 l 5 kg/m 2 s were attained and easily controlled. The flue gas cross...|$|R
40|$|This report {{determines the}} capital and {{operating}} costs of two different oxygen-based, pulverized coal-fired (PC) power plants and compares their economics {{to that of a}} comparable, air-based PC plant. Rather than combust their coal with air, the oxygen-based plants use oxygen to facilitate capture/removal of the plant CO{sub 2 } for transport by pipeline to a sequestering site. To provide a consistent comparison of technologies, all three plants analyzed herein operate with the same coal (Illinois No 6), the same site conditions, and the same supercritical pressure steam turbine (459 MWe). In the first oxygen-based plant, the pulverized coal-fired boiler operates with oxygen supplied by a conventional, cryogenic air separation unit, whereas, in the second oxygen-based plant, the oxygen is supplied by an oxygen ion transport membrane. In both oxygen-based plants a portion of the boiler exhaust gas, which is primarily CO{sub 2 }, is recirculated back to the boiler to control the combustion temperature, and the <b>balance</b> of the <b>flue</b> gas undergoes drying and compression to pipeline pressure; for consistency, both plants operate with similar combustion temperatures and utilize the same CO{sub 2 } processing technologies. The capital and operating costs of the pulverized coal-fired boilers required by the three different plants were estimated by Foster Wheeler and the balance of plant costs were budget priced using published data together with vendor supplied quotations. The cost of electricity produced by each of the plants was determined and oxygen-based plant CO{sub 2 } mitigation costs were calculated and compared to each other as well as to values published for some alternative CO{sub 2 } capture technologies...|$|R
