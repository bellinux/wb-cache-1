40|$|Affective {{neuroscience}} aims {{to understand}} how affect (pleasure or displeasure) is created by brains. Progress is aided by recognizing that affect has both objective and subjective features. Those dual aspects reflect that affective reactions are generated by neural mechanisms, selected in evolution based on their real (objective) consequences for genetic fitness. We review evidence for neural representation of pleasure in the <b>brain</b> (<b>gained</b> largely from neuroimaging studies), and evidence for the causal generation of pleasure (<b>gained</b> largely from <b>brain</b> manipulation studies). We suggest that representation and causation may actually reflect somewhat separable neuropsychological functions. Representation reaches an apex in limbic regions of prefrontal cortex, especially orbitofrontal cortex, influencing decisions and affective regulation. Causation of core pleasure or 'liking' reactions is much more subcortically weighted, and sometimes surprisingly localized. Pleasure 'liking' is especially generated by restricted hedonic hotspot circuits in nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral pallidum. Another example of localized valence generation, beyond hedonic hotspots, is an affective keyboard mechanism in NAc for releasing intense motivations such as either positively valenced desire and/or negatively valenced dread. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{discovery}} of a geometrical algorithm that provides a coherent step by step mechanical account {{of the structure of the}} nervous system, including the vertebrate brain, the spinal cord, the vertebral column, and the spinal nerves.

Neurology does not teach how the <b>brain</b> <b>gained</b> its shape, nor have any causative theories of brain formation been published in recent times. This paper proposes a hypothetical construction based on {{the discovery of}} a simple algorithm which generates topologically the form of the brain, the spinal cord, and the vertebral column by the deformation of a gridded segmented sphere by the inversion of its surface. The hypothetical model is in close analogy with nature: the blastula is a segmented gridded sphere which results from the subdivision of the egg.

40|$|Although all neurons {{carry the}} same genetic information, they vary {{considerably}} in morphology and functions and respond differently to environmental conditions. Such variability results mostly from differences in gene expression. Among {{the processes that}} regulate gene activity, epigenetic mechanisms {{play a key role}} and provide an additional layer of complexity to the genome. They allow the dynamic modulation of gene expression in a locus- and cell-specific manner. These mechanisms primarily involve DNA methylation, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of histones and noncoding RNAs that together remodel chromatin and facilitate or suppress gene expression. Through these mechanisms, the <b>brain</b> <b>gains</b> high plasticity in response to experience and can integrate and store new information to shape future neuronal and behavioral responses. Dynamic epigenetic footprints underlying the plasticity of brain cells and circuits contribute to the persistent impact of life experiences on an individual's behavior and physiology ranging from the formation of long-term memory to the sequelae of traumatic events or of drug addiction. They also contribute to the way lifestyle, life events, or exposure to environmental toxins can predispose an individual to disease. This chapter describes the most prominent examples of epigenetic marks associated with long-lasting changes in the brain induced by experience. It discusses the role of epigenetic processes in behavioral plasticity triggered by environmental experiences. A particular focus is placed on learning and memory where the importance of epigenetic modifications in brain circuits is best understood. The relevance of epigenetics in memory disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease is also addressed, and promising perspectives for potential epigenetic drug treatment discussed...|$|R
