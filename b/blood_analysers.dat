40|$|Mean {{platelet}} volume (MPV), {{measured using}} automated <b>blood</b> <b>analysers,</b> has been appraised {{as a potential}} biomarker in cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. The test, a useful tool in differentiation of thrombocytopenic states, has now been carried out for autoimmune disorders, but data are yet scarce. Controversial results have been obtained in systemic and organ-specific autoimmune disorders. Another test, the immature platelet fraction (IPF) reflects the amount of young, reticulated platelets. IPF is calculated by automated hematology analysis or flow cytometry, and it is usually high in patients with rapid platelet destruction. For both MPV and IPF, standardization of cutoff is a major need. In this review, we focus the current applicability of MPV and IPF as biomarkers in patients with autoimmune diseases...|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} <b>blood</b> <b>analyser,</b> Coulter Counter Model Sr(CC-SR) {{was recently}} introduced in our hospital.

The performance and precision of this <b>blood</b> <b>analyser</b> have been clitically evaluated {{by comparing the results}} obtained from the previous blood cell counter, the Coulter Counter Model Dn (CC-DN), a haemoglobinometer, and a high speed centfugal separator. The results are as follows: 1) The precision and liniarity for readings and dilutions on WBC, RBC, Hgb and Hct by the use of the CC-SR is satisfactory. 2) Good correlation between the measurements by whole blood analysis procedure and micro sample analysis procedure is recognized. 3) The amount of carryover from one sample to the next is negligible for practical purpose. 4) High correlation factors are obtained between the measurements by the CC-SR method and former methods: i. e. 0. 99 for WBC, 0. 93 for RBC, 0. 99 for Hgb and 0. 99 for Hct. 5) For these reason, {{it can be said that}} CC-SR is more useful successive instrument to measure WBC, RBC, Hgb, Hct than the CC-DN and other above mentioned instruments...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Iron {{deficiency}} anaemia (IDA) and anaemia {{of chronic}} disease (ACD) {{are common in}} elderly patients {{but there are no}} standard diagnostic criteria. The reticulocyte haemoglobin equivalent (Ret-He) is routinely measured by modern automated <b>blood</b> <b>analysers</b> and is an early indicator of iron deficiency. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the Ret-He level as calculated by the Sysmex XE- 5000 automated blood analyser is a useful parameter for the diagnosis of IDA in a geriatric hospitalized population. METHODS: In a prospective study, blood samples were collected in 26 geriatric patients with IDA and 111 patients with ACD diagnosed according to generally accepted laboratory and clinical criteria. A blood count including Ret-He, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and standard iron parameters was performed in each patient. RESULTS: Haemoglobin, Ret-He, MCV, MCH and MCHC levels were all significantly lower in IDA as compared to ACD patients. However, the area under the curve (AUC) was greater for MCH (0. 87, 95 % CI 0. 78 - 0. 95) and MCHC (0. 86, 95 % CI 0. 76 - 0. 96) then for Ret-He (0. 828, 95 % CI 0. 73 - 0. 93) and MCV (0. 80, 95 % CI 0. 68 - 0. 91). A Ret-He cut-off value of 26 pg had a sensitivity and specificity based on its optimal combination of 85 % and 69 % respectively. CONCLUSION: Analysis of Ret-He does not perform better than the classical red cell indices such as MCH and MCHC in differentiating IDA and ACD in geriatric patients. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|To measure pH in {{platelet}} concentrates, <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysers</b> {{with different}} calibration principles may be used. In this study, variances observed in pH measurements with {{two types of}} <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysers</b> were investigated. pH was measured in crystalloid solutions (platelet additive solution (PAS-II), phosphate-buffered solutions) and two types of platelet concentrates (containing 100 % plasma, or 65 % PAS-II/ 35 % plasma) with two blood gas analysers: either using liquid and gas calibration (AVL 945), or only liquid calibration (AVL OMNI). These measurements were compared with a reference method. Especially for PAS-II, large variation in pH was observed between AVL 945, AVL OMNI and the reference method: 6. 91 +/- 0. 02, 7. 35 +/- 0. 02 and 7. 188 +/- 0. 010, respectively (mean +/- SD; n = 12, P < 0. 0001, paired t-test). A significant difference in pH was also found for platelet concentrates in 65 % PAS/ 35 % plasma (6. 88 +/- 0. 09 on AVL 945 and 7. 02 +/- 0. 09 on AVL OMNI, n = 134, P < 0. 0001). Comparison with the reference method revealed minor differences with AVL 945, whereas AVL OMNI gave a mean difference in pH of + 0. 17.

40|$|Introduction To obtain strict glucose regulation, an {{accurate}} and feasible bedside glucometry method is essential. We evaluated three {{different types of}} point-of-care glucometry in seriously ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The study was performed as a single-centre, prospective, observational study in a 12 -bed medical ICU of a university hospital. Methods Patients with an expected ICU stay of more than 48 hours were included. Because the reference laboratory delivers glucose values after approximately 30 to 60 minutes, which is too slow to use in a glucose regulation protocol and for calibration of the subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) (CGMS System Gold), we first validated the ICU-based <b>blood</b> gas/glucose <b>analyser</b> ABL 715 (part 1 of the study). Subsequently, part 2 was performed: after inserting (and calibrating) the subcutaneous CGMS, heparinised arterial blood samples were drawn from an arterial line every 6 hours and analysed on both the Precision PCx point-of-care meter using test strips and on the <b>blood</b> gas/glucose <b>analyser</b> ABL 715. CGMS glucose data were downloaded after 24 to 72 hours. The results of the paired measurements were analysed as a scatter plot by the method of Bland and Altman and were expressed as a correlation coefficient. Results Part 1 : Four hundred and twenty-four blood samples were drawn from 45 critically ill ICU patients. The ICU-based <b>blood</b> gas/glucose <b>analyser</b> ABL 715 provided a good estimate of conventional laboratory glucose assessment: the correlation coefficient was 0. 95. In the Clarke error grid, 96. 8 % of the paired measurements were in the clinically acceptable zones A and B. Part 2 : One hundred sixty-five paired samples were drawn from 19 ICU patients. The Precision PCx point-of-care meter showed a correlation coefficient of 0. 89. Ninety-eight point seven percent of measurements were within zones A and B. The correlation coefficient for the subcutaneous CGMS System Gold was 0. 89. One hundred percent of measurements were within zones A and B. Conclusion The ICU-based <b>blood</b> glucose <b>analyser</b> ABL 715 is a rapid and accurate alternative for laboratory glucose determination and {{can serve as a}} standard for ICU blood glucose measurements. The Precision PCx is a good alternative, but feasibility may be limited because of the blood sample handling. The subcutaneous CGMS System Gold is promising, but real-time glucose level reporting is necessary before it can be of clinical use in the ICU.

The analytical method performed failed to assess serum gamma-glutamyl transferase. Descriptive statistics, normality assessment by means of Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, Gaussian range (mean ± 1 · 96 σ), Gaussian range after square root and logarithmic transformation, 2 · 5 th– 97 · 5 th percentile range were computed for each variable. With regard to data distribution, 12 variables out of 19 (glucose, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, total protein, albumin, triglycerides, cholesterol, Ca, P, Mg, Na and K) were normally distributed.

40|$|In {{human and}} {{veterinary}} medicine, arterial and venous haemoglobin oxygen saturations {{are often used}} to estimate the severity of a disease and to guide therapeutic decisions. In veterinary medicine, haemoglobin oxygen saturation (SO(2)) is usually calculated using a <b>blood</b> gas <b>analyser</b> and algorithms developed for humans. It is possible, therefore, that the values obtained in animals may be distorted, particularly in animals with a high haemoglobin oxygen affinity, like young calves. In order to verify this hypothesis, we compared the arterial (SaO(2)) and venous (SvO(2)) haemoglobin oxygen saturations calculated using three different algorithms, and the oxygen exchange fraction (OEF) at the tissue level, which is the degree of haemoglobin desaturation between arterial and venous blood (SaO(2) -SvO(2)), with the values obtained from the whole bovine oxygen equilibrium curve (OEC) determined by a reference method. The <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysers</b> underestimated SvO(2) values; consequently, the OEF was overestimated (by about 10 %). Two methods of reducing these errors were assessed. As the haemoglobin oxygen affinity decreases during {{the first month of}} life in calves a relationship between PO(2) at 50 % haemoglobin saturation (P 50) and age was established in order to correct the calculated values of venous and arterial SO(2), taking into account the estimated position of the OEC. This method markedly reduced the error for SvO(2) and OEF. Secondly, the SO(2) was calculated using a mathematical model taking into account the age of the animal and the specific effects of pH, PCO(2), and temperature on the bovine OEC. Using this method, the mean difference between the OEF values calculated using the mathematical model and those calculated by the reference method was close to zero. The errors produced by <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysers</b> can thus be minimised in two ways: firstly, by simply introducing a P 50 estimated from the age of the calf into the analyser before the measurement; and secondly, by calculating the SO(2) using a mathematical model applied to the bovine OEC.

BG was measured frequently on a <b>blood</b> gas <b>analyser</b> (Bayer Rapidlink). Primary outcome was 100 -day mortality. BG parameters were investigated for possible associations with mortality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 1, 763 patients were included (median age 1. 1 years; IQR 0. 1 - 5. 8). Although admission BG was not associated with mortality, a survival advantage was found in children who showed a reduction in BG on day 1 relative to the admission BG value (p < 0. 001). This remained statistically significant (p = 0. 007) after adjusting for severity of illness. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports an association between early BG profile and mortality in children admitted to PICU, with increased survival in those who demonstrate a fall in BG on day 1 relative to PICU admission. These findings are consistent with a survival advantage of intact BG homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cardiovascular {{prevention}} {{requires a}} diagnostic approach for population-based screening programmes aimed at early identification of modifiable risk factors. Dyslipidaemia, {{which is a}} major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, remains largely undiagnosed and undertreated. Point-of-care testing (POCT) provides immediate results for clinical decision-making, however, quality assessment is essential to ensure system performance requirements. CardioChek PA (CCPA), a portable whole <b>blood</b> <b>analyser</b> for rapid lipid measurement, {{has been on the}} market since 2002 but with limited evidence of performance levels. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess analytical performance issues of the device and possibly contribute to their solution. Methods: Over a 3 -year period, we repeatedly evaluated CCPA accuracy, precision, and discrepancies between instruments and between test strip lots by comparison with laboratory method. At our initial evaluation, the CCPA analyser underestimated total cholesterol (bias 6. 5 %) and gave within-assay CVs above 6 % for all lipid fractions. Our results solicited sequential improvements to the CCPA system by the manufacturer up to the performance level certified by the Cholesterol Reference Method Laboratory Network in 2013 : total error 1. 3 % for total cholesterol and 3. 1 % for high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Conclusions: POCT diagnostic tests need continuous quality management, including both quality control and quality assurance, to monitor the analytical process. A 3 -year external quality surveillance provided information useful in improving POCT performance. As a result, the device is now adequate for use in screening programmes aimed at early detection of lipid disorders...|$|R
