25|$|Mass {{finishing}} is a {{group of}} manufacturing processes that allow large quantities of parts to be simultaneously finished. The goal of this type of finishing is to burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare parts for further finishing, or break off die cast runners. The two main types of mass finishing are tumble finishing, also known as <b>barrel</b> <b>finishing,</b> and vibratory finishing. Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used. Mass finishing can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid lubricants, cleaners, or abrasives, while dry processes do not. Cycle times can be as short as 10minutes for nonferrous workpieces or as long as 2hours for hardened steel.|$|E

40|$|Fused Deposition Modeling {{is one of}} {{the most}} used {{additive}} manufacturing technology to produce prototypes and final parts without geometrical complexity limitations. One of the most limiting aspects of this technology is the obtainable roughness. Frequently, to comply with the component requirements, it is necessary to improve surface quality by finishing operations. <b>Barrel</b> <b>Finishing</b> is typically employed in industry to finish Fused Deposition Modeling components due to the advantage that the part does not need to be clamped and the process parameters are marginally affected by the part shape. The aim of this work is to develop a geometrical model of the deposited filament in order to predict the surface roughness of part after <b>Barrel</b> <b>Finishing</b> operation. The model depends upon the Fused Deposition Modeling process parameters, namely the layer thickness and the deposition angle, and the material removed during <b>Barrel</b> <b>Finishing</b> operation. The estimation of this quantity is measured as function of working time by a profilometer procedure showing an inverse square relationship, as confirmed by the statistical analysis. The proposed formulation is not restricted to average roughness: several parameters are provided. The theoretical models are validated by an experimental campaign. The comparison between modeled and experimental data shows significant reliability by means of statistical analysis. This formulation is a useful tool in Computer Aided Manufacturing step to choose the optimum combination of process parameters in order to obtain the desired results provided by <b>Barrel</b> <b>Finishing</b> operation...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{investigation}} on the hybridization of two technology is proposed: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and <b>Barrel</b> <b>Finishing</b> (BF). FDM {{is able to}} fabricate parts with no complexity limitation but with poor surface roughness and tolerances. The coupling with BF showed the capability to improve both these limiting aspects. A theoretical model has been proposed to predict heights attainable by the hybrid machining. A particular geometry has been designed and fabricated to conduct an experimental campaign to determine effects of process parameters on attainable surface quality. The results evidenced that average roughness remarkably decreases, while tolerances depend upon the deposition angle. Thus a design for manufacturing is proposed, that is a modification of the original virtual model to reduce FDM deviation. A case study has been investigated to verify the method...|$|E

The magnetic flux density in the container could then be varied by the height of the container and the applied voltage. The effect of the magnetic flux density on the finishing characteristics was investigated under various conditions. It was found that the magnetic flux density in the container continuously increased when the upper iron core end of the finishing machine was installed near the cover of the container. Optimum values of the magnetic flux density with respect to the finishing characteristics were obtained, and revealed to vary with respect to the material of the workpieces...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{sheet metal}} {{processes}} the burrs cannot be completely eliminated {{during the process}} but can be minimized by optimization of the process parameters. Hence the deburring often becomes an essential secondary operation. Most of the deburring operations are hand-made and therefore several manufacturers tend to eliminate these tedious and labor-intensive operations due to time and cost issues. Moreover, clamping problems can arise which, together with the deburring forces, can induce dimension alterations and local deformations, particularly for thin sheets. <b>Barrel</b> <b>finishing</b> is an old technique commonly used to improve the surface roughness of complicated parts, but can find interesting applications also in the deburring. Aim of this work is to present an experimental investigation on the deburring of sheet metal performed by barreling.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model to}} describe {{the evolution of the}} roughness profile machined by <b>barrel</b> <b>finishing</b> (BF) operation. It is based on the measure of the material removal (MR) and on the assumptions that no plastic deformation and cutting of peak take place. In order to obtain these information, a morphological procedure has been developed based on the finding of a representative peak of the profile. By this way, it is possible to overcome the common problem of repositioning the instrument on a specific point of the surface, especially if an action takes place. The measurements taken on specimens machined in different conditions satisfied the assumptions and confirmed the capability of the model to predict roughness attainable. An interesting result has been the constant MR per working time. The analysis has been carried out by means of statistical approach demonstrating the reliability of the model. This permits to obtain a desired level of surface roughness just stopping the operation at a specific working time. Especially for BF, it is very useful considering that the inspection in-process is not possible. © Springer-Verlag London 2013...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the production and}} characterization of a controlled electrochemical modification of titanium surfaces, consisting of a two-step anodic spark deposition (ASD) process and a <b>barrel</b> <b>finishing.</b> The treatment was performed on titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V, as most representative titanium alloy used in mechanical and aeronautical applications, where improved adhesion and tribological performances are required. FIB/SEM microstructural observations, nanoindentation, scratch, fretting tests and wear and friction tests were carried out both on laboratory specimens (planar pellets, 1. in. diameter) and on Ti 6 Al 4 V bolts of different shapes and sizes, to investigate {{the effect of a}} three dimensional shape on the correct execution of the electrochemical treatment and on the coating's mechanical performance. The formation of a double layered coating was observed, with a slightly decreased surface hardness and stiffness compared to the metallic substrate and increased scratch and fretting wear resistances, thanks to an excellent adherence to the substrate, an optimal value of the hardness to modulus ratio (H/E) and a marked decrease of the friction coefficient. The proposed coating procedure could be therefore a suitable solution for those applications where low friction, wear resistance under low load sliding contact and corrosion resistance are required. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|The report {{gives an}} {{overview}} about phenomena on corrosion of joined connections based on self-piercing-rivets. With {{the use of}} these components above all the coating of the cutting part of the rivet is endangered. Here the fast attack on the base material of the element is possible during a corrosive load. Additional also the existing gap ranges are endangered. For the available tasks of joined connections the possible types of corrosion are represented, as well as the examined joining processes and the used coating systems are described. With the joined connections the focus is on material-mix aluminum/steel. As joining processes self-piercing-rivets - half tube rivets and solid punching rivets - and bushing rivets are examined. Coatings contain different materials, e. g. aluminum, zinc, tin, organic portions; and different goals e. g. sacrificial anode, basis for finish painting.

In the project various phenomena were found and represented; e. g. decrease and also increase of the static and cyclic strength of before-corroded punch-riveted connections.
