40|$|Abstract:- The {{resistance}} of the wiring between the source computer and destination computer in a computer network makes the line imperfect. Wires placed {{side by side in}} cables also make good capacitors. The line also has some self-inductance but the primary problems are the capacitance and resistance [1]. Increasing the cable capacitance and resistance (a natural occurrence with increased cable length) also increases the distortion of the received signal. Protocols are the set of rules governing the organization and transmission of data on a computer network [2]. The three functions of a protocol consist of determining how handshaking will occur, determining how to implement a communication path, and determining how data will be packaged. There are many protocols in use today and they are always expanding because of technological developments. The process of setting up an exchange of data is referred to as handshaking. Handshaking occurs when the transmitter and receiver engage in a dialog to let each other {{know that there is a}} message to be sent, that the line is free to transmit, and that the message was or was not received. The communication path is the route the data will take from the sender to the receiver. Protocols establish procedures for error detection in case the data does not get to the destination or is corrupted. Computers must know before sending the data how to package the data. Most protocols are <b>bit</b> or character <b>oriented.</b> In order for two computers to communicate they must use the same protocol. Many different protocol...|$|R

40|$|Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) {{nodes and}} passive RFID transponders (tags) have severe {{constraints}} in computing power and hence offer particular {{challenges in the}} provision of e-Security. Passive RFID tags are at the lowest end of the spectrum in the family of devices with constrained computing power and memory. New approaches, differing from the traditional cryptosystems such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman, focusing on reducing complexity while being capable of providing an adequate level of security, are required for such devices. The use of one time codes is particularly appropriate as they guarantee perfect security and offer simple implementation.

It consists of a Built-In Self-Test (BIST) module, a Built-In Address-Analysis (BIAA) module and a Multiplexer (MUX) module. The BISR is designed flexible {{so that it can}} provide four operation modes to SRAM users. The feature of the proposed BISR strategy is that it can save each fault address for only once. To achieve a high repair speedin BIAA module, fault addresses and redundant ones form a one-to-one mapping. Besides, instead of adding spare words, rows, columns or blocks in the SRAMs, users can select normal words as redundancy. This paper proposes BISR strategy for DRAM also. Advantage of Proposed Work is that the BISR can perform <b>bit</b> <b>oriented</b> and word oriented memory analyzing and also it supports self-repair {{strategy with}} selectable redundancy. In the existing paper BISR is implemented for only SRAM, whereas the proposed paper extended it to DRAM. We design word oriented SRAM and DRAM and implement BISR analyzer with selectable redundancy.

40|$|ABSTRACT: HDLC {{controller}} megacell is a {{high performance}} module for the <b>bit</b> <b>oriented,</b> switched, non-switched packet transmission module. The controller fulfills the specifications according to ITU q. 921, X. 25 level 2 recommendations. It supports half duplex and full duplex communication lines, point-to-point and multipoint channels. Furthermore, the controller is designed to permit synchronous, code transparent data transmission. The control information is always {{in the same position}} and specific bit patterns used for control differ dramatically from those representing data that reduces the chances of errors. The data stream and transmission rate is controlled by the network node. In this paper, we have designed, simulated and implemented HDLC controller. This design is coded in a hardware description language (VHDL). The function of coded design is to simulate on simulation software (e. g. modelsim). After simulation, the design is synthesized and translated into a structural architecture, in terms of the components on the target FPGA device (Spartan 3) and perform the post-translate simulation in order to ensure the proper functioning of the design after translation. After the successful simulation of the post-translate model, the design is mapped to the existing slices of the FPGA and the post-map model simulated. The post-map model does not include the routing delays. The objective {{of this paper is to}} run the programmed FPGA at frequency i. e. it Operates up to 155. 52 Mbits/s data rates.

40|$|A process whose {{correctness}} {{depends on}} its adherence to explicit timing constraints is a time dependent process. Applications requiring such processes are found in automated manufacturing and control systems, computer networks and aeronautic systems. Unfortunately, {{there has been little}} theoretical interest in the issues that arise when the explicit temporal performance of a process is considered part of its behavior. Timed Acceptances provides a framework in which time dependent processes can be formally described and analysed. The timed acceptances model supports an explicit representation of time, accounts for nondeterminism, is expressive and forms the basis of a proof system for reasoning about time dependent processes. It consists of a partially ordered domain of time dependent processes and a set of operators. A time dependent process is characterized by its possible execution sequences. An execution sequence consists of a timed trace and the nondeterministic choices the process may make after executing the trace. The temporal behavior of the process is represented by associating an occurrence time with each event it executes. The partial ordering, process containment, represents the notion of one process being less deterministic than another. It can be used to show that a process satisfies its specification. The operators of the algebra are like the CSP operators and are defined with respect to time. As we show, they form a natural and expressive syntax for representing time dependent processes. Using these operators, one can express delays, bounded timing constraints, timeouts, periodic processes, decisions made on the occurrence time of an event and process interaction. The operators enjoy a variety of mathematical properties. Together with process containment, these properties form a powerful proof system for analyzing time dependent processes. We have shown the use of Timed Acceptances in modelling and analyzing various time dependent processes. In particular, it has been applied to the analysis of a timed communication protocol, <b>Bit</b> <b>Oriented</b> Signalling, currently being used at AT 2 ̆ 6 T 2 ̆ 7 s Digital Multiplexed Interface. ...|$|E
40|$|FPGAs are {{reprogrammable}} logic {{devices and}} make the acceleration of specific problems possible by a very close hardware adaption. Many frame grabbers and some digital cameras have an FPGA installed. For such systems {{it is an interesting}} feature {{to reduce the amount of}} image data to minimize the transmission link between camera and computer and the data transferred over the PC bus. Besides, the flexibility of FPGAs allows to change or adapt the data compression method according to the capacity of the communication channel or the required image quality. The ability to establish new compression standards simply by reprogramming the FPGA, as well as to be able to compress large pictures in real time (≥ 30 fps) makes FPGAs in this application field most interesting. The aim of this work is to examine the fitness of FPGAs in the field of image data compression and to determine which resource requirements exist and how much external logic and memory are necessary for a realization. To meet the various system requirements, the work is subdivided into three parts. In the first section FPGAs in combination with an image sensor, which has no dedicated memory added, will be inspected. This limits the choice to point and <b>bit</b> <b>oriented</b> algorithms. An improved binary adaptive arithmetic encoder can be presented that operates with one bit per clock. This implementation enables image compression standards to run in real time. A special hardware adapted algorithm based on the two-point projection was designed to exceed the data troughput up to approx. 580 MByte/sec. The first hardware implementation of the lossless JPEG-LS standard completes this section. The next section deals with FPGA based frame grabbers where additional memory is presented and typical in the minimum size of an acquired image. This external memory allows the use of block oriented algorithms, as e. g. the vector quantization (approx. 44 MByte/sec, 4 X 4), which was long time not possible due to the high resource equirements. Another improvement is the realization of Wavelet coding by means of Embedded Zerotree Wavelets (approx. 23 MByte/sec) and the new JPEG 2000 image compression standard. The latter operates with only approx. 6 MByte/sec because of the complex bit-planer coder used. The last section covers the field of industrial image data reduction, where other limitations for the algorithm and the hardware implementation must be taken into account. For such applications compression algorithms based on psycho-visual techniques are not wanted. To get still high compression results, two special application-oriented solutions are introduced in this work. They have a high data throughput (approx. 32 - 50 MByte/s) and allow a cost-efficient implementation by low resource requirements. The presented results regarding the time response and the resource consumption show that image data reduction is possible in real time using FPGAs. Algorithms not implemented in hardware till now due to their high complexity uses also a PC to full capacity. For these two architectures an improvement can be expected in the near future by ongoing hardware development. The application fields dominated by ASICs can reveal new possible areas for FPGAs by their advantage of reprogramming...|$|E
