40|$|To {{understand}} {{shapes and}} movements of cells undergoing lamellipodial motility, we systematically explore minimal free-boundary models of actin-myosin contractility {{consisting of the}} force-balance and myosin transport equations. The models account for isotropic contraction proportional to myosin density, viscous stresses in the actin network, and constant-strength viscous-like adhesion. The contraction generates a spatially graded centripetal actin flow, which in turn reinforces the contraction via myosin redistribution and causes retraction of the lamellipodial boundary. Actin protrusion at the boundary counters the retraction, and {{the balance of the}} protrusion and retraction shapes the lamellipodium. The model analysis shows that initiation of motility critically depends on three dimensionless parameter combinations, which represent myosin-dependent contractility, a characteristic viscosity-adhesion length, and a rate of actin protrusion. When the contractility is sufficiently strong, cells break symmetry and move steadily along either straight or circular trajectories, and the motile behavior is sensitive to conditions at the cell <b>boundary.</b> <b>Scanning</b> of a model parameter space shows that the contractile mechanism of motility supports robust cell turning in conditions where short viscosity-adhesion lengths and fast protrusion cause an accumulation of myosin in a small region at the cell rear, destabilizing the axial symmetry of a moving cell...|$|R

Annealing at 1550 °C in air for several hours promoted Fe diffusion into LSGM via the grain <b>boundaries.</b> <b>Scanning</b> electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy analyses showed that iron was located at the grain boundary while the grain bulk preserved the LSGM composition. Impedance spectra obtained at low temperature consist of the two usual bulk and grain boundary contributions. A significant increase in total conductivity was observed for the iron-doped samples, the effect being greater for the grain boundary contribution. The total conductivity measured for the iron-containing material revealed a slight decrease with decreasing oxygen partial pressure, suggesting the onset of p-type electronic conduction. Estimates of the p-type electronic conductivity (σp) were obtained by fitting the low temperature impedance spectra to a simple equivalent circuit including one parallel electronic branch.

However imaging the magnetic field remains a challenge and only recently, Burresi et al. [1], managed to apply the technique for imaging the vertical magnetic field component. Newly emerging artificial materials are often designed to have a strong magnetic response. Consequently, characterization of the magnetic near-field with nanoscale resolution has become very relevant. We report mapping of the lateral magnetic near-field distribution in plasmonic nanoantennas by hollow-pyramid probe aperture-SNOM [2]. By means of full-field simulations we investigate how the near-field probe acts as a confined local light source and how it efficiently excites surface plasmon resonances in the nanoantennas. This excitation occurs at lateral magnetic field maxima and affects the detected light intensity, enabling the visualization of the lateral magnetic near-field distribution of surface plasmon modes with subwavelength spatial resolution.

The {{average grain size}} of BN ceramics increases with increase in KCl content (from an average grain size of TO to 80 mu m) {{as a result of}} the increased liquid-phase formation of KCI, at the grain <b>boundaries.</b> Differential <b>scanning</b> calorimetry (DSC) carried out on the KCl-added samples indicates an upward shift in the transition temperature (T-c), from 723 K (for BN) to 734 K (for 5 mol% KCl-added BiV).

The relative permittivity as well as the dielectric loss decrease by more than half of the original values upon the addition of KCI. The relative permittivities of the KCl-added ceramics are comparable with the values predicted by the logarithmic mixture rule.
