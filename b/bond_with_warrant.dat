50|$|During the Japanese {{stock market}} {{boom in the}} late 1980s, {{investment}} bankers persuaded many Japanese companies to raise capital by issuing <b>bonds</b> <b>with</b> <b>warrants</b> attached, although they did not require the funds for operational purposes. Clients were tempted by the potential returns the investment firms said they could generate on stock market investments. However, as stock values fell, companies were in a vicious circle where not only their investments soured, the debt remained after issued warrants expired, weakening the companies' capital base.|$|R
50|$|Consequently, {{this had}} an adverse impact on whole Japanese asset bubble. Firstly, cheap and easily {{available}} loans reduced the funding {{costs for the}} purpose of speculation. Second, stock rises, coupled by low interests rates, reduced the capital costs and aided financing the capital market (e.g. convertible <b>bonds,</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>with</b> <b>warrants,</b> etc.). Third, the combination of a rise in land and stock prices pushed up the value of assets held by corporations, which effectively increased their sources of funding since such these increased the collateral value of the assets.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} use of public debt {{mezzanine}} instruments, which include participating bonds, subordinated bonds, convertible <b>bonds</b> and <b>bonds</b> <b>with</b> <b>warrants,</b> by non-financial corporations and financial corporations in the Czech Republic. It aims to analyse and evaluate use of mezzanine financing instruments {{in the form of}} public debt mezzanine by selected economic entities in the Czech Republic in 2006 – 2012, and identify factors affecting the scope of their utilization. The performed research implies that public debt mezzanine instruments are used in the Czech Republic marginally only. Within the monitored period, these instruments were issued in the total volume of CZK 13. 43 bn (i. e. about EUR 0. 49 bn), where subordinated bonds got a share of CZK 13. 26 bn (i. e. about EUR 0. 48 bn). The share of newly issued public debt mezzanine instruments in the total financial sources of non-financial corporations and financial corporations within the monitored period was on the top in 2009, when it amounted to 0. 08 %. Wider utilization of public debt mezzanine instruments is particularly prevented by the fact that potential issuers are afraid of high costs relating to the process of issuance, but also to the life cycle of such an issue, and they are also afraid of lack of interest of investors (in the case of subordinated bonds and participating bonds), the owners’ fear of extension of control (in the case of convertible <b>bonds</b> and <b>bonds</b> <b>with</b> <b>warrants),</b> or {{the fact that it is}} difficult to estimate the cost of capital (in the case of participating bonds) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Present {{days the}} firms {{have to face}} the {{increasing}} competition, difficult economic conditions and an increasing need for major investments. In these circumstances, even the well managed and highly profitable businesses have limited options for financing growth or strengthening their equity resources. In these conditions, alternative forms of financing such as mezzanine finance {{are becoming more and more}} a supplement to the traditional forms of corporate financing. Mezzanine is a type of financing that combines elements of debt and equity financing, a hybrid construct that makes use of various longstanding instruments. The most important mezzanine financing instruments include: subordinated loans, participating loans, profit participation rights, convertible <b>bonds</b> and <b>bonds</b> <b>with</b> <b>warrants.</b> A common feature of the various instruments is that they can be structured flexibly in many different forms in order to provide solutions for the specific financing requirements of private and listed companies.

40|$|The {{case for}} {{accounting}} separately for the debt and equity {{features of a}} convertible bond is based on two main assumptions: convertible debt can be decomposed into two, or more, fundamental financial instruments, and a convertible bond has the same economic substance as a <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> a detachable <b>warrant.</b> These assumptions are re-examined in this paper where it is shown that it is generally not possible to decompose a convertible bond into fundamental financial instruments, nor {{is it possible to}} form a package of a bond and a detachable warrant that replicates the character of the convertible bond. <br/...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we look at}} two {{competing}} hypotheses to explain IPO underpricing in France when a seasoned offering follows the IPO. The first hypothesis assumes that the initial underpricing is a signal from a high quality firm in the anticipation of a subsequent equity issue at a higher price. The second competing hypothesis assumes that the market transmits to managers their valuation of the company. Our database examines two types of subsequent risky issuances: on the one hand, stocks {{and on the other}} hand, hybrid issuances (such as convertible <b>bonds,</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>with</b> attached <b>warrants,</b> and stocks <b>with</b> attached <b>warrants).</b> Further, in the French market, firms may be introduced through different mechanisms, which are not equally compatible with both hypotheses. We show that the initial underpricing is greater if a stock issuance rather than other security offerings of a convertible nature subsequently follow the IPO. We find evidence in favor of the signaling hypothesis in the case of fixed price IPOs. For the auction-like procedures, we show that the initial investors' demand, rather than post-IPO performance, determines the type of security that is issued, but has no effect on the financing decision itself. The market feedback hypothesis is therefore only weakly supported: a poor market message does not keep managers from expanding, but rather encourages them to use stage financing rather than straight equity.

The SH value of the board <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA satisfied type 8 standard of JIS A 5908 (> 300  N) [19].

Methods: Two hundred human premolars were divided into 4 equal groups. In Group 1 (control), no prophylaxis was done prior to <b>bonding</b> <b>with</b> SEP. In Groups 2 - 4 different prophylaxis pastes, that is, pumice, nonfluoridated and fluoridated pastes were used respectively. After bonding, the samples were debonded using a universal testing machine at a cross head speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Results: The shear bond strength (MPa) for Group 1 - 4 was 5. 99, 7. 51, 7. 57, and 7. 71, respectively. Conclusions: The result shows that the shear bond strength of brackets <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> SEP without prior prophylaxis produces statistically significant lower bond strength as compared to brackets which were <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> prior prophylaxis treatments. The shear bond strengths of orthodontic brackets <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> SEP with prior prophylaxis with various prophylaxis pastes were not statistically different from each other.
