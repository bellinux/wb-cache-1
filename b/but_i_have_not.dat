500|$|Initially {{intended}} to express {{anger at the}} draft, the protests deteriorated into [...] "a virtual racial pogrom, with uncounted numbers of blacks murdered on the streets". The conditions in the city were such that Major General John E. Wool stated on July 16, [...] "Martial law ought to be proclaimed, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> a sufficient force to enforce it".|$|E
500|$|Byron had {{not been}} {{responding}} to Nicolo's letters, which Nicolo mentions in the letter: [...] "It is now almost three years that I am at Athens; and have sent you many letters, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> received any answer". It is possible that Byron did not respond because he was married and, according to the 20th-century Byron biographer Phyllis Grosskurth, [...] "Nicolo {{was the last person}} he would have wanted to hear from." ...|$|E

500|$|Initially {{intended}} to express {{anger at the}} draft, the protests turned into a race riot, with white rioters, predominantly Irish immigrants, attacking black people throughout the city. The official death toll was listed at either 119 or 120 individuals. Conditions in the city were such that Major General John E. Wool, commander of the Department of the East, said on July 16 that [...] "Martial law ought to be proclaimed, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> a sufficient force to enforce it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Speechless" [...] deal with being lost for words because of love. The song opens with Jackson's singing acappella: [...] "Your love is magical, that's how I feel, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> the words here to explain", which Rick de Yampert of The Daytona Beach News-Journal felt the singer [...] " [...] sweetly". The chorus {{includes}} the lines, [...] "Speechless, speechless, that's {{how you make}} me feel. Though I'm with you, I am far away and nothing is for real." [...] A second acappella verse bookends the track.|$|E
500|$|Through {{the winter}} of 1959–60 Grainger {{continued}} to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital [...] went well, but his conducting in the afternoon [...] was, in his own words, [...] "a fiasco". [...] Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie [...] that {{he was working on}} an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott's early songs. [...] His last letters, written from hospital in December 1960 and January 1961, record [...] attempts to work, despite failing eyesight and hallucinations: [...] "I have been trying to write score for several days. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> succeeded yet." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I {{covered this}} scene with {{another one of}} the key {{changing}} into the fat black guy, and the ignition slot turning into Maybellene. I covered a lot more cartoony foreplay scenes with a simple close-up of the fat black man's face with his hand covering his eyes. You can {{get a sense of how}} many scenes had to be altered, by how many times this close-up drawing was used. It got used a lot! At one point the original version [...] "A" [...] of Maybellene existed. Ralph had a print of it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> seen it since I worked on it. We did versions [...] "A," [...] B", and [...] "C," [...] with [...] "C" [...] being the tamest and that is what got into the so-called [...] "X" [...] version of Heavy Traffic. Another scene I can recall doing multiple versions of was the guy in the racing cap, pissing on the fat black guy's ass. This was completely eliminated, causing a jump in the action." ...|$|E
500|$|Olinda's {{position}} was precarious. [...] "He lacked {{the character and}} skills to impose his authority, while the attempts he did make to take control were seen as presumptuous, a usurpation of a position belonging to the emperor alone." [...] The [...] "generation of politicians {{who had come to}} power in the 1830s, following upon the abdication of Pedro I, had learned from bitter experience the difficulties and dangers of government. By 1840 they had lost all faith in their ability to rule the country on their own. They accepted Pedro II as an authority figure whose presence was indispensable for the country's survival." [...] The Liberals took the dispute over lowering the age of majority directly to the populace, inciting them to place pressure on the politicians. The Brazilian people supported lowering the age of majority and a popular song was heard in the streets: [...] "We want Pedro the Second,/ Although he is not of age;/ The nation excuses the law,/ and long live the majority!" [...] As emperor, Pedro II [...] "was the living symbol of the unity of the fatherland [...] This position gave him, in the eyes of public opinion, a higher authority than that of any regent." [...] The Conservatives weren’t opposed to the Liberal plan, and both (including the regent himself, who would inevitably lose his office) wished to end the regency. Olinda asked Pedro II what he thought about the issue of majority, and he simply answered, [...] "I have not thought about that," [...] and continued, [...] "I have already heard about it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> given it any attention." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{airborne}} {{assault on the}} three bridges and Fort Eben-Emael had been an overall success for the Fallschirmjäger of Sturmabteilung Koch; the artillery pieces possessed by Fort Eben-Emael had been disabled, {{and two of the}} three bridges designated to be captured by the sub-units of Sturmabteilung Koch had been captured before they could be destroyed. The capture of the bridges, and the neutralization of the artillery pieces in the Fort allowed infantry and armour from the 18th Army to bypass other Belgian defences and enter the heart of Belgium. In a post-war publication, General Kurt Student wrote of the operation, and the efforts of Group Granite in particular, that [...] "It was a deed of exemplary daring and decisive significance [...] I have studied the history of the last war and the battles on all fronts. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been able to find anything among the host of brilliant actions—undertaken by friend or foe—that could be said to compare with the success achieved by Koch's Assault Group." [...] A number of officers and non-commissioned officers were awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for their participation in the operation, including Lieutenant Rudolf Witzig who led the assault on Fort Eben-Emael in the absence of Koch. Sturmabteilung Koch was expanded after the end of Fall Gelb to become 1st Battalion of the newly formed 1st Airlanding Assault Regiment, which itself consisted of four battalions of Fallschirmjaeger trained as a gliderborne assault force. Hauptmann Koch was promoted to the rank of Major for his part in the operation and assumed command of the 1st Battalion. Due to the destroyed bridges, the 17th Armored Engineer Battalion built a new bridge over the canal on 15 September 1944.|$|E
60|$|It is true <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done many {{considerate}} {{things for}} her, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> done enough.

My going away to the city {{at the very moment}} when my presence was most necessary seemed base desertion. While she had been suffering, longing and lonely, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been feasting.

Its benefits extend to all persons of all races.|$|E
2500|$|Carl Linnaeus {{classified}} the kraken as a cephalopod, designating {{the scientific}} name Microcosmus marinus {{in the first}} edition of his Systema Naturae (1735), a taxonomic classification of living organisms. The creature was excluded from later editions. Linnaeus's later work, Fauna Suecica (1746), calls the creature singulare monstrum, [...] "a unique monster", and says of it Habitare fertur in mari Norwegico, ipse non dum animal vidi, [...] "It is said to inhabit the seas of Norway, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> seen this animal".|$|E

60|$|I {{felt her}} hand {{trembling}} under mine, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> {{the courage to}} look at her. I heard her call my name again a little cry, the very poignancy of pity and distress. It almost unnerved me.|$|R

2500|$|Armenian {{national}} movement, {{also known}} as the [...] "Armenian revolutionary movement", was the Armenian national effort to re-establish an Armenian state in the historic Armenian homelands of eastern Asia Minor and the Transcaucasus. The decline of the Ottoman Empire in part was the result and in part the cause of rise of nationalism among various groups that made up the multi-ethnic and multi-religion Empire. The Russo-Turkish War, which resulted in the independence of Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, provided a model for other aspiring nationalists and revolutionaries. The Hinchak and Dashnak, Armenian revolutionary committees, were formed in Eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire following the Berlin Treaty, which were very much under direct Russian threat. Yet, this is contrasted by Fâ'iz el-Ghusein, who stated, [...] "I have enquired of many Armenians whom I have met, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> found one who said that he desired political independence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Returning to the United States in {{the late}} summer of 1870—as the Franco-Prussian War was starting—Cassatt lived with her family in Altoona. Her father {{continued}} to resist her chosen vocation, and paid for her basic needs, but not her art supplies. Cassatt placed two of her paintings in a New York gallery and found many admirers but no purchasers. She was also dismayed at the lack of paintings to study while staying at her summer residence. Cassatt even considered giving up art, as she was determined to make an independent living. She wrote in a letter of July 1871, [...] "I have given up my studio & torn up my father's portrait, & have not touched a brush for six weeks nor ever will again until I see some prospect of getting back to Europe. I am very anxious to go out west next fall & get some employment, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> yet decided where." ...|$|E

2500|$|Quatrain 2 {{continues}} with the poet confessing about his journey on finding false love. In line 5, the phrase [...] "looked on truth" [...] {{is used in}} terms that the poet has seen what is true. Scholar Stephen Booth has interpreted the line: [...] "I have seen truth, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> properly regarded it." [...] Booth's interpretation gives insight about the poet's disregard for the lover's affection. Line 5 continuing onto line 6 can be interpreted about the poet's journey of promiscuity and finding new lovers. The {{use of the word}} [...] "askance" [...] is used in this case as the poet's disdain with the affairs he has encountered. [...] "Askance and strangely" [...] are used to describe how none of these loves compare to what he had experienced with this young man. The word blenches can be translated into modern English as a flaw. The interpretation of line 7 can mean that these flawed affairs gave me a blink of youth. Booth has multiple interpretations of what this line could possibly mean. His interpretations is that it [...] "rejuvenated [...] and gave [...] another chance to learn by trial and error" [...] or that it [...] "rejuvenated [...] ". The end of this quatrain ends the poets confession of failed attempts of finding the ideal love and starts his confession of love to the young man. The last line is a very powerful way to end the quatrain and start the next section. [...] "Worse essays" [...] is used in this line to describe the failed [...] "experiments" [...] of the poet. The failed experiments proved that the young man is the best love that he has encountered.|$|E
