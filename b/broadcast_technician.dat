50|$|In video applications, a {{vectorscope}} supplements a {{waveform monitor}} {{for the purpose}} of measuring and testing television signals, regardless of format (NTSC, PAL, SECAM or any number of digital television standards). While a waveform monitor allows a <b>broadcast</b> <b>technician</b> to measure the overall characteristics of a video signal, a vectorscope is used to visualize chrominance, which is encoded into the video signal as a subcarrier of specific frequency. The vectorscope locks exclusively to the chrominance subcarrier in the video signal (at 3.58 MHz for NTSC, or at 4.43 MHz for PAL) to drive its display. In digital applications, a vectorscope instead plots the Cb and Cr channels against each other (these are the two channels in digital formats which contain chroma information).|$|E
5000|$|In modern systems, a profanity delay {{can be a}} {{software}} module manually operated by a <b>broadcast</b> <b>technician</b> that puts a short delay (usually thirty seconds) into the broadcast of live content. This gives the broadcaster time to censor the audio (and video) feed. This {{can be accomplished by}} cutting directly to a non-delayed feed, essentially jumping past the undesired moment (something that can be quite jarring to a viewer or listener). In other cases, dedicated hardware units similar to the original digital unit but with improved quality and editing capability can be used. These products can even [...] "build up" [...] delay with difficult program material such as music. Alternatively, a bleep noise or other substitute sound can be inserted. This is more difficult to do with live content, however, and more often appears on recorded material.|$|E
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{economic}} value of technical and fundamental recommendations simultaneously featured on “Talking Numbers, ” a CNBC and Yahoo joint <b>broadcast.</b> <b>Technicians</b> display stock-picking skills, while fundamentalists reveal no value. In particular, technicians overwhelmingly outperform fundamentalists in predicting returns over horizons {{of three to}} nine months and moreover they produce large alpha {{with respect to the}} Fama and French (1993) and momentum benchmarks. Considering market indexes, Treasuries, commodities, and various equity indexes, both schools of recommendation generate poor forecasts. Overall, the evidence shows that proprietary trading rules could, at best, enhance investments in single stocks, while returns on broader assets are unpredictable...|$|R

5000|$|Technical issues {{addressed}} included that of synchronization between transmitters (GPS {{was used}} to supply a 1 Hz and a 10 MHz reference frequency, as well as timing information) and precise control of transmitted frequencies (to within 1 Hz). Identification for each individual transmitter needed to be embedded in the signal for troubleshooting purposes, yet the main data stream on every synchronised transmitter must be identical; this is done by adding a second, low bit rate spread spectrum signal 27-30 dB weaker than the main signal. As this [...] "watermark" [...] identifier is buried under the stronger main signal, multiple repetitions of this same identifier could be received and summed {{in order to provide}} a readable version of the watermark to <b>broadcast</b> <b>technicians.</b> A standard receiver, meanwhile, would see the same signal from all transmitters by design.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, many {{operations}} at an individual broadcast station were handled manually by <b>broadcast</b> engineering <b>technicians</b> {{at the local}} station. Network feeds would arrive by satellite; these would contain time cues to indicate when the station could switch to a prerecorded local station break from a videotape recorder, a local station ID from a character generator or a local program such as a newscast. Syndicated programming would arrive separately, either recorded in advance from satellite for tape delay or transported on prerecorded media. Local advertisements would be stored on tape cartridges ("carts") which {{would need to be}} inserted in the correct timeslots manually. A station could not operate unattended, even if it were merely retransmitting a network television programme originated elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|The three {{essays in}} this {{dissertation}} study either how telecommunications regulation shapes the way media industries are organized or how copyright law constrains the creative works that {{the entertainment industry}} produces. 	Chapter Two analyzes {{the impact of the}} Telecommunications Act of 1996 on local radio markets. Using a unique geographic data set, the chapter calculates the pre- and post- 1996 limits on the number of stations a single firm may own in a locality as actually implemented by the FCC. The limits are surprisingly permissive and vary considerably from city to city. A strong correlation exists between the 1996 increase in the limits and the increase in ownership concentration over the following five years. This correlation, and the variation in the limits on station ownership serve as a natural experiment in increased concentration to study the effects of concentration on various radio-market outcomes. Increased concentration causes an increase in advertising revenue and the number of programming formats offered, but no change {{in the size of the}} listening audience. 	Chapter Three examines copyright law’s treatment of digital sampling, the practice of using fragments of existing music in new music. The chapter describes a model of copyright holders’ and samplers’ incentives. Bargaining may not divide the profit from the sample-based derivative work between upstream and downstream creators in a way that provides musicians in both groups with sufficient incentives to create. The model demonstrates that, under some conditions, assigning the property rights in sample-based works to the upstream copyright owners can backfire. An optimal system for regulating sequential creation would balance the incentives of upstream and downstream creators, to the benefit of both groups. 	Chapter Four returns to the radio industry to estimate the effect of increased ownership concentration on labor markets. Local radio markets with higher ownership concentration employ fewer radio announcers, news reporters, and <b>broadcast</b> <b>technicians.</b> Moreover, those professions experienced smaller wage increases in more concentrated markets. These results suggest that increased concentration poses a threat to localism in radio as large firms shift away from hiring local employees and toward centralized staffing...|$|R
