A multi-body dynamics software, SIMPACK 1, is used to generate a detailed non-linear full vehicle model for simulation and control assessment.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Even since railway vehicles were invented, railway scientists and engineers have been {{putting a lot of}} effort in finding the solution to the fundamental conflict between vehicle stability in the lateral plane and vehicle's capability of negotiating curves. Many configurations of railway bogie vehicles have been proposed and applied to minimise the conflict. The purpose of the research project is i) to create new configurations that can decouple the basic conflict, ii) to investigate dynamic behaviour of the new configurations and iii) to conceive a new mechanism that can improve the dynamics of the new configurations. Three configurations of body-steered bogie vehicles have been set up in the research. The sufficient conditions for them to be capable of perfect steering have been derived. They are called perfect steering vehicles when they satisfy these sufficient conditions. Their curving ability, stability and ride performance have been investigated. To overcome the disadvantages of the perfect steering vehicles, the reconfigurable mechanism has been conceived. The improvement in the dynamic behaviour of the perfect steering vehicles with the reconfigurable mechanism has been demonstrated. A computer program has been developed to undertake the simulation. The steering capability of the perfect steering vehicles is much better than that of conventional bogie vehicles. There are two modes of instability in the perfect steering vehicles: low conicity instability and conventional instability in the perfect steering vehicle. The perfect steering vehicles can decouple the conflict between their conventional stability and curving. The improvement of stability and ride performance of the perfect steering vehicles is, however, limited by the low conicity instability. When the reconfigurable mechanism is applied, a body-steered <b>bogie</b> <b>vehicle</b> can become a perfect steering vehicle when on curves and can become a conventional <b>bogie</b> <b>vehicle</b> when in other circumstances. Low conicity instability can be eliminated when the reconfigurable mechanism is used. This class of vehicles possess the advantages of both conventional bogie vehicles and perfect steering vehicles, and thus, provide a very valuable solution for the fundamental conflicts between the stability and steering ability and between ride performance and stability of railway vehicles. The findings in this thesis have great significance in developing perfect steering vehicles...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} detect and isolate {{component}} faults in a railway suspension system is important for improved train safety and maintenance. An undetected failure in the suspension systems can cause severe wheel-rail wear, reduce ride comfort, worsen passenger safety and increase unexpected maintenance costs. Existing fault detection methods are limited in several respects, such as effectiveness/sensitivity for fault detection, or robustness to external condition changes. This thesis investigates a model-less fault detection and isolation approach using cross correlation and/or relative variance techniques, developed to overcome these limitations. This thesis treats a conventional <b>bogie</b> <b>vehicle</b> with a symmetrical structure. Excited by the track irregularities, {{the dynamics of the}} vehicle are studied under the normal conditions, with an emphasis on the vertical and related motions of the bogies and the carbody. Two fault detection schemes employing data processing using data directly from measurement are discussed. One uses cross correlation evaluation of the basic bogie motions to detect component fault; the other takes advantage {{of the relationship between the}} relative variances of the suspension accelerations. Finally, the fault isolation schemes are assessed based on the comparison of fault detection performances in different conditions. The proposed approach does not require detailed knowledge of the vehiclelbogie and external track irregularities. The effectiveness of the approach is verified by computer simulations in Matlab/Simulink. ...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{computer}} based techniques to model and simulate wheeled rovers on rough natural terrains is considered. Physical models of a prototype vehicle {{can be used}} to test the correlation of the simulations in scaled testing. The computer approaches include a quasi-static planar or two dimensional analysis and design tool based on the traction necessary for the vehicle to have imminent mobility. The computer program modeled a six by six wheel drive vehicle of original kinematic configuration, called the Rocker Bogie. The Rocker Bogie was optimized using the quasi-static software with respect to its articulation parameters prior to fabrication of a prototype. In another approach used, the dynamics of the Rocker <b>Bogie</b> <b>vehicle</b> in 3 -D space was modeled on an engineering workstation using commercial software. The model included the complex and nonlinear interaction of the tire and terrain. The results of the investigation yielded numerical and graphical results of the rover traversing rough terrain on the earth, moon, and Mars. In addition, animations of the rover excursions were also generated. A prototype vehicle was then used in a series of testbed and field experiments. Correspondence was then established between the computer models and the physical model. The results indicated the utility of the quasi-static tool for configurational design, as well as the predictive ability of the 3 -D simulation to model the dynamic behavior of the vehicle over short traverses...|$|E
40|$|Wire rope is a versatile, flexible, {{high-strength}} member {{that is used}} in many mechanical systems. However, due to {{the complexity}} of wire rope, analytical investigations have been relatively limited. Previous attempts to create simplified models of wire rope were not validated with physical testing and used a cumbersome beam-and-shell or beam-and-solid method for simulating the wire rope. An improved LS-DYNA model of 19 -mm diameter 3 x 7 wire rope commonly used in roadside cable guardrail installations has been developed. A Belytschko-Schwer beam element was selected along with material *MAT_ 166. Since wire rope displays internal damping due to friction of strands and wires, low-frequency bending modes of wire rope were damped in the model using the LS-DYNA frequency range command, and high-frequency noise was reducing using the part stiffness damping. The optimum element length based on timestep, accuracy, and computational cost was determined to be between 0. 4 and 0. 8 in. (10 - 20 mm). Dynamic component tests were conducted on wire rope to determine material properties, and consisted of high-speed jerk tests of wire rope constrained at one end, and perpendicular impact of wire ropes constrained at both ends. These tests were simulated and the results compared to the physical tests. The new proposed wire rope model more accurately simulated the wire rope tension and <b>bogie</b> <b>vehicle</b> motion than previously-developed wire rope models. The wire rope was also modeled in full-scale crash test models using a Chevrolet C 2500 pickup model, consistent with NCHRP Report No. 350 TL- 3 impact conditions. Results of the crash test and simulation were compared, the wire rope response was determined to be accurate, though the wire ropes released from the hook bolts prematurely. Nonetheless, wire rope response, vehicle motion and trajectory were accurate. Therefore the new wire rope model was determined to be an improvement over existing models of wire rope and is recommended for use in cable guardrail simulations.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Strong post guardrail systems have long been employed to keep misguided vehicles on the roadway. In order to combat vegetation growth around the posts, many new guardrail installations are being encased in pavement mow strips. By increasing material stiffness of the confining layers around the posts, this practice changes the dynamic response of the guardrail system to the impact of a vehicle. This research aims to analyze existing mow strip configurations by using experimental testing and numerical simulation and to develop predictive, full-scale simulations that enable assessment of the performance of guardrail systems encased in mow strips. To develop a test matrix of mow strip designs in preparation for possible testing, a state of practice survey of Texas Department of Transportation districts is performed. Current mow strip construction methods and designs are gathered. Mow strip dimensions, materials, and depths are considered in addition to the presence of asphalt and grout "leave-out" layers around posts. Seventeen configurations using wood and steel posts embedded in asphalt, concrete, soil, and grout are subjected to dynamic impact testing with a <b>bogie</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Dynamic impact tests from the test matrix are numerically simulated using the nonlinear, dynamic, explicit code LS-DYNA. Modeling of soil, steel, concrete, and grout components is investigated. Results from numerical simulation are validated using experimental test results. Four full-scale mow strip system simulations are assembled using subcomponent models. Impact of a vehicle with a G 4 (1 S) guardrail system is simulated. Results are compared to a full-scale crash test for validation. Enhancements to the simulation are made to increase numerical stability of the vehicle model and improve interaction between the vehicle and guardrail system. In addition, three mow strip guardrail systems are modeled using the G 4 (1 S) system as a baseline case. Concrete mow strip and grout leave-out encasements are also examined. Through numerical simulation of a full-scale crash test it is shown that a concrete mow strip with 457 x 457 mm (18 x 18 in.) grout leave-outs performs at a similar level in a full-scale crash test to an equivalent system with posts embedded only in soil. This system is recommended for a full-scale crash test...|$|E
