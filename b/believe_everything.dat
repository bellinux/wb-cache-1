25|$|Animism is not {{the same}} as pantheism, {{although}} the two are sometimes confused. Some religions are both pantheistic and animistic. One of the main differences is that while animists <b>believe</b> <b>everything</b> to be spiritual in nature, they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united (monism), the way pantheists do. As a result, animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul. In pantheism, everything shares the same spiritual essence, rather than having distinct spirits and/or souls.|$|E
25|$|Miyagawa’s {{works are}} known for their themes of {{exploring}} memory and finding identity. She said once in an interview, “I <b>believe</b> <b>everything</b> we know about ourselves is entirely based on memory—history, science, art, religion are all constructs of human memory.” Her plays are often written in fluid time and space, rather than in a traditional linear timeline. Many of her works draw from Japanese literature and art forms for inspiration and also employ characters that are ghosts. Her works have explored a variety of issues, such as the interactions between Eastern and Western cultures, feminism, drug addiction, and the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|Priscilla {{was always}} keen {{to go to}} Hollywood with Elvis, but he kept telling {{her that he was}} too busy for that and she was made to stay in Memphis. During the filming of Viva Las Vegas, Elvis began an affair with his co-star Ann-Margret. When Priscilla read of these reports in the press, she confronted Elvis. He told her that they were simply rumors to promote the film and that she should not <b>believe</b> <b>everything</b> that she read in the press. For the next few years, Elvis would have {{intimate}} relationships with many of his leading ladies and co-stars, all the while denying their existence to Priscilla. Eventually she was allowed to visit him in Hollywood, but her visits were kept short.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, {{a lawsuit}} exposed a {{possible}} family feud over the chain's corporate leadership. Richard Boyd, one of In-N-Out's vice presidents and co-trustee of {{two-thirds of the}} company stock, accused Lynsi Martinez and allied corporate executives of trying to force out Esther Snyder and attempting to fire Boyd unreasonably. Pre-empting the suit, Martinez, Snyder and Taylor appeared in a December video message to employees, telling them not to <b>believe</b> <b>everything</b> they hear. The company then responded with a lawsuit of its own, alleging Boyd had construction work done on his personal property and charged it to the company, as well as favoring contractors with uncompetitive bids. Boyd was then suspended from his role as co-trustee and Northern Trust Bank of California took his place (as co-trustee) until a hearing set for May 10, 2006. However, in April, the judge dismissed two of In-N-Out's claims against Boyd. A trial date of October 17, 2006, was set but never occurred, and a settlement was reached out of court. Ultimately, Boyd was permanently removed from his role as an employee and co-trustee.|$|E

Throughout the song, Jackson sings in a quick-voice, which some music critics viewed as Jackson [...] "not singing" [...] but [...] "harrumphing". [...] It is a plea to the public to not <b>believe</b> <b>everything</b> in the tabloids; and the lyrics are about media bias and sensational journalism about Jackson and in general. This can be heard in lyrics such as, [...] "Just because you read it in the magazine or see it on the TV screen don't make it factual".|$|E

In September 2012, Stanton confirmed, saying, [...] "What was immediately on the list was writing a second Carter movie. [...] When that went away, everything slid up.

500|$|... "Money" [...] was {{interpreted}} as being directed at Evan Chandler, {{the father of}} the boy who accused Jackson of child sexual abuse.

In [...] "This Time Around", Jackson asserts himself as having been [...] "falsely accused". The song features The Notorious B.I.G. (aka Biggie Smalls) two years before his death in 1997. Jackson worked with Biggie again posthumously in 2001 on Jackson's following album, Invincible on the song [...] "Unbreakable"; this made him the only rapper to appear on multiple Jackson LPs. [...] "Earth Song" [...] was described as a [...] "slow blues-operatic", and its lyrics pertain to environmental concerns. On HIStory, Jackson covered Charlie Chaplin's [...] "Smile" [...] and The Beatles' [...] "Come Together".
