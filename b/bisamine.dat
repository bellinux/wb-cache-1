40|$|Toward gaining {{insight into}} the {{behavior}} of bimetallic catalysts for olefin polymerization, a series of structurally related binuclear zirconium catalysts with <b>bisamine</b> bisphenolate and pyridine bisphenolate ligands connected by rigid teraryl units were synthesized. Anthracene- 9, 10 -diyl and 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetramethylbenzene- 1, 4 -diyl were employed as linkers. Bulky Si^iPr_ 3 and SiPh_ 3 substituents {{were used in the}} position ortho to the phenolate oxygen. Pseudo-C_s and C_ 2 symmetric isomers are observed for the binuclear complexes of <b>bisamine</b> bisphenolate ligands. In general, binuclear catalysts show higher isotacticity compared to the monozirconium analogues, with some differences between isomers. Amine bisphenolate-supported dizirconium complexes were found to be moderately active (up to 1. 5 kg mmol_(Zr) ^(– 1) h^(– 1)) for the polymerization of 1 -hexene to isotactically enriched poly- 1 -hexene (up to 45 % mmmm) in the presence of stoichiometric trityl or anilinium borate activators. Moderate activity was observed for the production of isotactically enriched polypropylene (up to 2. 8 kg mmol_(Zr) ^(– 1) h^(– 1) and up to 25. 4 % mmmm). The previously proposed model for tacticity control based on distal steric effects from the second metal site is consistent with the observed behavior. Both <b>bisamine</b> bisphenolate and pyridine bisphenolate supported complexes are active for the production of polyethylene in the presence of MAO with activities in the range of 1. 1 – 1. 6 kg mmol_(Zr) ^(– 1) h^(– 1) and copolymerize ethylene with α-olefins. Little difference in the level of α-olefin incorporation is observed between mono- and dinuclear catalysts supported with the pyridine bisphenolate catalysts. In contrast, the size of the olefin affects the level of incorporation differently between monometallic and bimetallic catalysts for the <b>bisamine</b> bisphenolate system. The ratio of the incorporation levels with dinuclear vs mononuclear catalysts decreases with increasing comonomer size. This effect is attributed to steric pressure provided by the distal metal center on the larger olefin in dinuclear catalysts...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: First-row metal {{complexes}} often undergo undesir-able one-electron redox processes during two-electron {{steps of}} catalytic cycles. We report the amination of aryl chlorides and bromides with primary aliphatic amines catalyzed by a well-defined, single-component nickel precursor (BINAP) Ni(η 2 -NC-Ph) (BINAP = 2, 2 ′-bis(biphenylphosphino) - 1, 1 ′-binaphthalene) that minimizes {{the formation of}} Ni(I) species and (BINAP) 2 Ni. The scope of the reaction encompasses electronically varied aryl chlorides and nitrogen-containing heteroaryl chlorides, including pyridine, quinoline, and isoquinoline derivatives. Mechanistic studies support the catalytic cycle involving a Ni(0) /Ni(II) couple for this nickel-catalyzed amination and are inconsistent with a Ni(I) halide intermediate. Monitoring the reaction mixture by 31 P NMR spectroscopy identified (BINAP) Ni(η 2 -NC-Ph) as the resting state of the catalyst in the amination of both aryl chlorides and bromides. Kinetic studies showed that the amination of aryl chlorides and bromides is first order in both catalyst and aryl halide and zero order in base and amine. The reaction of a representative aryl chloride is inverse first order in PhCN, but the reaction of a representative aryl bromide is zero order in PhCN. This difference {{in the order of}} the reaction in PhCN indicates that the aryl chloride reacts with (BINAP) Ni(0), formed by dissociation PhCN from (BINAP) Ni(η 2 -NC-Ph), but the aryl bromide directly reacts with (BINAP) Ni(η 2 -NC-Ph). The overall kinetic behavior is consistent with turnover-limiting oxidative addition of the aryl halide to Ni(0). Several pathways for catalyst decomposition were identified, such as the formation of the catalytically inactive <b>bis(amine)</b> -ligated arylnickel(II) chloride, (BINAP) 2 Ni(0), and the Ni(I) species [(BINAP) Ni(μ-Cl) ] 2.

40|$|The {{influence}} of several polymeric additives on specific glucose uptake rate of flocs of a S. cerevisiae strain - S. cerevisiae NRRL Y 265 was studied.

An increase on glucose uptake rate was always observed when comparing with calcium bound flocs. For bis(polyoxyethylenebis(amine)) 20, 000 the increase was only 19 % but for BPA 1, 000 a value of more than 50 % was observed. For Magna Floc LT 25 a two fold increase was measured. The determination of floc size and porosity {{in the presence of the}} additives indicated that, on the basis of these parameters, it was not possible to explain the observed glucose uptake rates. The floc porosites in additive bound flocs were similar and 10 % larger than for calcium bound flocs and glucose uptake rate was larger for the largest flocs - Magna Floc LT 25 bound flocs were the largest followed by BPA t, 000, bis(polyoxyethylene-bis(amine)) 20, 000 and calcium bound flocs. These values disagree with what should be expected in diffusion controlled processes. The calculation of intercellular floc distance indicated that polymeric additives act on the reduction of diffusional limitations by increasing the available flux area for glucose inside the flocs. By analysing different kinds of packings, it was also observed that the packing arrangement for yeast cells in flocs is close to the cubic packing. The simulation of this arrangement for the obtained floc sizes confirmed that the 10 % increase in floc porosity is sufficient to explain the increase in the available flux area...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} investigations upon pseudopeptides {{which were}} conducted to improve {{our understanding of the}} fate of synthetic macromolecules in cells and to develop approaches to influence that fate. The low uptake of molecules across the external cellular membrane is the principal barrier against effective delivery of therapeutic products to within the cell structure. In nature, disruption of this membrane by amphiphilic peptides plays {{a central role in the}} pathogenesis by bacterial and toxin infections. These amphiphilic peptides contain both hydrophobic and weakly charged hydrophilic amino acid residues and upon activation they become integrated into the lipid bilayers of the extracellular or endosomal membranes. The architectures of the pseudopeptides described here were designed to display similar pH dependent membrane rupturing activity to that of peptides derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin HA- 2. This HA protein promotes fusion of the influenza virus envelope with the cell endosome membrane due to a change in conformation in response to the acidic pH of the endosome lumen (pH 5. 0 - 6. 0). The pseudopeptides were obtained by the copolymerisation of L-lysine and L-lysine ethyl-ester with various dicarboxylic acid moieties. In this way a linear polyamide comprising of alternating pendant carboxylic acids and pendant hydrophobic moieties was made. At physiological pH (pH 7. 4), electrostatic repulsion of pendant anionic carboxyl groups along the polymer backbone is sufficient to overcome the intramolecular association of the hydrophobic groups resulting in an extended conformation. At low pH (typically pH 4. 8) loss of charge results in increased intramolecular hydrophobic association and the polymer chain collapses to a compact conformation, leading to precipitation of the polymer. Consequently, a conformation dependent functional property could be made to respond to small changes in the environmental pH. Pseudopepides were investigated for their cytoxicity towards a well known cell line, namely C 26 (colorectal adenocarcinoma) and were shown through the use of a cell viability assay, MTT (3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide) to be well tolerated by C 26 cells over a range of concentrations (2 - 500,μg/ml) at physiological pH (pH 7. 4). A modified version of a shorter 30 -minute coupled enzymatic assay, the LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) assay was used to evaluate the ability of the pseudopeptides to disrupt the membrane of two different cell lines (COS- 1; African green monkey, kidney and A 2780; human ovarian carcinoma) at low pH (pH 5. 5). The cell membrane disruption property of the pseudopeptides was successfully demonstrated for COS-I and A 2780 cell lines at this pH (pH 5. 5). A variety of cell lines were chosen owing to limited availability and to compare the cytotoxic action of these pH responsive psudopeptides towards normal and tumorogenic cell lines. To investigate the intracellular delivery of one of the pseudopeptides, poly (L-lysine iso-phthalamide) and its subcellular location, a Cy 3 <b>bisamine</b> fluorophore was conjugated into its backbone, at ratios of dye:lysine of 1 : 20, 1 : 30, 1 : 40, 1 : 60 and 1 : 80. Native polyacrylacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and high voltage paper electrophoresis (HVPE) studies of the polydyes were conducted and provided evidence that that the Cy 3 <b>bisamine</b> fluorophore was conjugated into the backbone of the polymer, poly (L-lysine iso-phthalamide). The subcellular fate of the fluorescentlylabelled "polydye" (hereafter PD 20) was monitored by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) in CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells cultured in-vitro at various pH values (pH 7. 4 and 5. 0). LSCM images depicting time-dependent internalisation of PD 20 indicated that PD 20 traversed the extracellular membrane of CHO cells cultured in-vitro within ten minutes and migrated towards the endosomal regions where the pH is in the region of 5. 0 to 6. 0. Nuclear localisation of PD 20 was demonstrated in a subpopulation of CHO cells. A further study was completed in CHO and HepG 2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) cells cultured in-vitro using a lower molecular weight polymer to demonstrate that the molecular weight of "polydye" could be tailored to attain nuclear trafficking in cells. Prospective use of this technology encompasses a method of delivering a payload into a living cell based upon the hypercoiling nature of the pseudopeptides studied in this thesis and has led to a patent application (GB 0228525. 2; 20 (2) ...|$|E

Thus 1 effectively promotes the deprotomagnesiation of bIm under mild reaction conditions to give the α-metallated intermediate [{Na(THF) }{(PhSi(NAr*)) Mg(bIm*) }] (2) (bIm * = 2 -N-methylbenzimidazolyl). Analysis of crystallographic and NMR data of 2 combined with DFT calculations show that the metallated C in the bIm* ligands possesses a significant carbenic character. Contrasting with previous studies of benzothiazole (btz), 1 does not react with an excess of bIm even under forcing refluxing conditions. Contrastingly, the amination reactions of equimolar amounts of 1 with pyrrole and 2, 6 -diisopropylaniline allowed the isolation of [{(Ph Si(NAr*) (NHAr*)) Mg(NCH) (THF) Na(THF) }] (3) and [{Na(THF) } {(PhSi(NAr*) (NHAr*)) Mg(NHAr*) (THF) }] (4) respectively as crystalline solids. Highlighting the ability of 1 to act as a polybasic reagent, 3 and 4 are formed {{as the result of the}} deprotonation of two molecules of the relevant amine via its butyl group and one amido arm of the silyl(bisamido) ligand. Similarly, the reactions of 1 with 3 molar equivalents of the relevant amine yielded homoleptic tris(amido) compounds [(THF) NaMg(NCH) ] (5) and [{Na(THF) }{Mg(NHAr*) }] (7), with the concomitant formation of <b>bis(amine)</b> PhSi(NHAr), as a result of the complete amination of 1 using its three basic sites.

Despite their similar constitution, these heteroleptic tris(amido) magnesiates adopt contrasting structures, with the former displaying a contacted ion-pair structure, where Na and Mg are connected by two bridging pyrrolyl anions, whereas the latter gives rise to a solvent-separated ion pair motif. To the best of our knowledge 3 represents the first crystallographically characterized magnesium compound containing an anionic non-substituted form of pyrrole.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{application}} of dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) to identify new DNA-binding compounds, and {{provide insight into the}} factors that are important in DNA recognition. The discovery of new binding motifs and DNA-binding compounds are important to understanding the rules of DNA recognition, and in the long term has the potential to assist on the design of new compounds with therapeutic and biotechnological applications. DCC was used to generate heterocycles functionalised with amidines and carbohydrates in the presence of different oligonucleotides, in order to identify functionality that would increase the affinity of the heterocycles for DNA. Water soluble heterocycle building blocks of quinolines, imidazoles and naphthalamide were synthesised as thiol and disulfide derivatives. The thiol substitution on the quinoline ring was varied in these building blocks, {{and in the case of}} 4 -thioquinoline, included an electron withdrawing trifluoromethyl group. The carbohydrates included glucose and aryl derivatives of the deoxysugar fucose, while the amidines included alkyl, benzyl and aryl groups. Flexible <b>bisamine</b> and bisthiol derivatives with the potential to form DNA bisintercalators were also studied. DCC experiments were conducted using thiol disulfide chemistry in aqueous methanol using either GSSG/GSH at neutral pH or disulfide exchange at basic pH, conditions that have not been used previously for studies with nucleic acids. DCC experiments were conducted to assess the effect of overall charge, substitution of the quinoline ring, the importance of deoxysugars versus glucose, aryl and imidazole rings on DNA-binding. Analysis of both the DNA bound and unbound solutions provided important insights into the features that are important for DNA recognition and allowed the effect of subtle structural features on DNA-binding to be identified. Molecular visualisation of the selected DNA-bound and unbound compounds were used to rationalise the results and propose minor groove and intercalation binding motifs. Flexible amino quinoline Q 4 -Y and guanidine disulfides Q 4 -A 1 and Q 4 -A 2 interacted with DNA. In contrast, neither of the aromatic guanidine disulfides Q 4 -A 2 and Q 4 -A 3 interacted with DNA, suggesting that the aryl groups may interfere with positioning of the amidine near the phosphate backbone. In the case of 7 -trifluoromethyl- 4 -thioquinoline Q 2, the thioglucose derivate Q 2 -S 1 was amplified with DNA, and the relative binding affinity Q 2 -Cys>Q 2 -A 1 >Q 2 - S 1 was determined. This result is consistent with proposed models of intercalation of the structurally related compound, chloroquine, with DNA. In contrast, the rigid arylfucose with 2 -thio quinoline Q 1 -S 2, was amplified in preference to the corresponding benzylic disulfide or glucose derivative. The fucose sugar was shown to be important for DNA-binding, consistent with DNA minor groove binding. The flexible bisthiol derivatives failed to produce any DNA-binding compounds, and experiments with naphthalimides were unsuccessful due to precipitation during the course of the assay. Biostable mimics of the two lead compounds Q 1 -S 2 and Q 2 -S 1 were studied. The thioether analogue of Q 1 -S 2 interacted more strongly with DNA compared to the amide, consistent with minor groove binding. Both 1, 4 - and 1, 5 -triazole analogues of Q 2 -S 1 bound to DNA, with the similar binding profile of the 1,- 4 - triazole to the parent disulfide supporting intercalation as the binding mode...|$|E

Diese Materialien wurden im Hinblick auf einen Einsatz als dünnes, transparentes und elektrisch leitfähiges Elektrodenmaterial untersucht und weiterentwickelt. Das Ziel war es dabei, einen geeigneten Ersatz für das aktuelle Standardelektrodenmaterial Indiumzinnoxid (ITO) zu explorieren. Der erste Teil der Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit dem metallorganischen Precursor Methyltrioxorhenium (MTO). Die Polymerisation von MTO konnte durch den Einsatz verschiedener Basen und Elektronendonoren chemisch katalysiert werden. Dadurch konnte die benötigte Polymerisationstemperatur signifikant abgesenkt werden. Die Polymerisation in Ammoniak verläuft dabei über die Ausbildung mehrerer thermolabiler Zwischenstufen, welche in dieser Arbeit erstmals identifiziert, kristallisiert und röntgenographisch untersucht werden konnten. Dabei konnte nachgewiesen werden, dass die Polymerisation im ersten Schritt über den Diaddukt-Komplex (Bisamin) methyltrioxorhenium initiiert wird. Dieser weist signifikant aktivierte Re-C und Re=O Bindungen auf und geht bei Raumtemperatur im geschlossenen Glaskolben schnell zu einem Oxo-verbrückten Komplex über. Dieser polymerisiert bereits bei 0 °C zu poly-MTO mit interkalierten Ammoniak-Molekülen. Für die Abscheidung von dünnen, leitfähigen Schichten konnte die Polymerisation von MTO bei 110 °C thermisch induziert werden. Dabei wurden mit Hilfe eines Temperaturgradienten von ca. 5 °C reproduzierbar 20 - 200 µm dicke Schichten von polymerem MTO auf Glas abgeschieden. Diese weisen einen metallischen Widerstandsverlauf bei einem spezifischen elektrischen Widerstand von ρ(300 K) = 2, 6 mΩ cm auf. Der zweite Teil dieser Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit verschiedenen Schwefel-Stickstoff-Systemen, allen voran der polymeren Verbindung Polythiazyl ((SN) x). Hier wurden Röntgenbeugungsstudien an Einkristallen von [S 5 N 5]+[FeCl 4]-, [S 3 N 2 Cl]+Cl- und [S 5 N 5]+[AsF 6]- durchgeführt. Anhand von Messungen der physikalischen Eigenschaften von (SN) x-Einkristallen konnte gezeigt werden, dass das Zusammenspiel von magnetischen Momenten in dem quasi-eindimensionalen Supraleiter mit einem externen angelegten Magnetfeld zu einem ungewöhnlichen Verhalten der supraleitenden Sprungtemperatur Tc führt. So steigt Tc in einem schwachen Magnetfeld zunächst leicht an und zeigt erst beim Überschreiten eines kritischen Feldes den erwarteten Abfall. Dieser Effekt kann durch die Polarisation der magnetischen Momente durch das angelegte Magnetfeld erklärt werden. Für die Abscheidung von (SN) x in Form dünner Schichten wurden vier verschiedene Syntheserouten für (SN) x untersucht, optimiert und anschließend miteinander hinsichtlich der Durchführbarkeit, Wirtschaftlichkeit, Reinheit der Produkte und Synthesedauer verglichen. Dabei konnte die (SN) x-Synthese durch die Hydrolyse von S 3 N 3 Cl 3 in Wasser als sicherer, schneller, einfacher und kostengünstiger Zugang zu großen Mengen an polykristallinem (SN) x exploriert werden. Die bei der CVD-Abscheidung erhaltenen dünnen Schichten von (SN) x weisen ein halbleitendes Widerstandverhalten auf. Dieses lässt sich mit einem Modell für Elektronen-Hopping-Prozesse in granularen Metallen beschreiben. Die besten Schichten von (SN) x weisen dabei einen spezifischen elektrischen Widerstand von ρ(300 K) = 6 mΩ cm auf. This work {{deals with}} the synthesis, {{polymerization}} and chemical vapor deposition of polymeric methyltrioxorhenium and polythiazyl. These materials have been investigated and further developed for application as a thin, transparent and electrically conductive electrode material. The aim was to explore a suitable replacement for the current standard electrode material indium tin oxide (ITO). The {{first part of the}} thesis {{deals with the}} organometallic precursor Methyltrioxorhenium (MTO). The polymerization of MTO has been catalyzed chemically by using different bases and electron donors. Throughout this process the required polymerization temperature could be lowered significantly. The polymerization in ammonia proceeds via the formation of several thermolabile intermediates that have been identified, crystallized and studied by X-ray diffraction techniques in this work. Based on this work, it was demonstrated that the polymerization is initiated in the first step via the formation of the diadduct-complex (<b>bisamine)</b> methyltrioxorhenium. This complex has significantly activated Re-C and Re=O bonds, and at room temperature in a closed glass flask it converts quickly to an oxygen-bridged dimeric complex. This complex begins polymerization at 0 °C to poly-MTO with intercalated ammonia molecules. For the deposition of thin conductive layers the polymerization of MTO has been induced thermally at 110 °C. With the aid of a temperature gradient of 5 °C 20 - 200 µm thick layers of polymeric MTO have been deposited reproducibly on glass. These layers have a metallic resistivity behaviour with an electrical resistivity of ρ(300 K) = 2. 6 mΩ cm. The second part of this thesis deals with various sulfur-nitrogen-systems, especially the polymeric compound polythiazyl ((SN) x). Here, X-ray diffraction studies on single crystals of [S 5 N 5]+[FeCl 4]-, [S 3 N 2 Cl]+Cl- and [S 5 N 5]+[AsF 6]- have been performed. Based on measurements of the physical properties of (SN) x single crystals it was shown that the interaction of magnetic moments in the quasi-one-dimensional superconductor with an external applied magnetic field leads to an unusual behaviour of the superconducting transition temperature Tc. At first the superconducting transition temperature slightly increases in a weak magnetic field. Only after crossing a critical magnetic field the expected drop of Tc occurs. This effect {{can be explained by the}} polarization of the magnetic moments due to the applied magnetic field. For the deposition of (SN) x in the form of thin layers four different synthetic routes for (SN) x have been investigated, optimized and compared in terms of feasibility, efficiency, purity of the products and synthesis time. Remarkably, the (SN) x synthesis by the hydrolysis of S 3 N 3 Cl 3 in water has been explored as a safe, fast, easy and cheap access to large amounts of poly-crystalline (SN) x. Via chemical vapour deposition techniques thin layers of (SN) x have been obtained. Measurements show a semiconductive resistivity behaviour of these layers. The curve progression can be described with a model for electron-hopping processes in granular metals. The best layers of (SN) x show a resistivity of ρ(300 K) = 6 mΩ cm...|$|E
