50|$|Euthynnus lineatus, the <b>black</b> <b>skipjack</b> or <b>black</b> <b>skipjack</b> tuna, is {{a species}} of ray-finned bony fish in the family Scombridae. It belongs to the tribe Thunnini, {{better known as the}} tunas.|$|E
50|$|The little tunny's {{markings}} {{allow it}} to easily be distinguished from similar species. It is often confused with the skipjack tuna, the frigate tuna, the Atlantic bonito, and the bullet tuna. Close relatives also include the kawakawa and the <b>black</b> <b>skipjack.</b> The scattering of dark, fingerprint-like spots between the pectoral and pelvic fins cannot be found on any related Atlantic species. The first dorsal fin of the Atlantic bonito is also lower and sloping. Its lack of teeth on the vomer can set it apart from its close Pacific relatives, the kawakawa and the <b>black</b> <b>skipjack.</b> The dorsal fins of the bullet and frigate mackerel are set apart. Unlike the little tunny, the skipjack tuna lacks markings {{on the back and}} has broad, straight stripes on the underside.|$|E
50|$|Today, the {{productive}} reef areas in Piñas Bay, fished by boats from the famous Tropic Star Lodge, {{and the many}} other reefs and islands along the Pacific coast of Panama, particularly Coiba Island in the Gulf of Chiriqui, still have probably the best fishing for black marlin in the Western Hemisphere. Black marlin averaging 200 to 500 lb hunt schools of rainbow runners, <b>black</b> <b>skipjack,</b> and other prey over these structures along with large Pacific sailfish and dorado. Occasional specimens will reach well over 600 lb. Slow trolling with bridle-rigged live skipjack is the predominant technique used to target black marlin by the Tropic Star fleet. At Coiba Island, the Hannibal Banks is among most productive areas where trolling lures is employed successfully.|$|E
40|$|Early life {{stages of}} tuna species were {{investigated}} {{along the northern}} coasts of Tunisia {{in the summer of}} 2010, from 7 to 14 July. A total of 74 stations, distributed on a regular grid, were sampled. Larvae of five tuna species were identified: the Atlantic bluefin tuna, the bullet tuna, the Atlantic <b>black</b> <b>skipjack,</b> the Atlantic bonito and the albacore tuna. Larval distribution patterns show that Atlantic bluefin tuna and albacore tuna usually spawn in offshore oligotrophic waters and Atlantic <b>black</b> <b>skipjack</b> larvae on the continental shelf. The widespread distribution of bullet tuna larvae, suggests that it spawns on the entire continental shelf and over the shelf break. The results from the quotient analysis carried out to characterize the spawning habitat of each species, show that the input of recent surface Atlantic water (AW) masses {{play a key role in}} the spawning strategy of tuna species, particularly in the case of the Atlantic bluefin tuna, whose larvae were mainly caught in the mixed waters resulting from the interaction between recent AW and resident AW, as demonstrated by their preference for salinity values between 36. 9 and 37. 4...|$|E
40|$|Atlantic <b>black</b> <b>skipjack</b> (Euthynnus alletteratus Raf., 1810) {{caught in}} Turkish and North Cypriot waters {{is one of}} the members of the Scombridae, having a wide {{distribution}} in the world, especially in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean, and adjacent seas. It is a fish with commercial value for the Turkish and North Cypriot fisheries. E. alletteratus are mostly caught by purse-seiners in Turkish waters. In North Cypriot waters, Atlantic <b>black</b> <b>skipjack</b> are caught by trolling. In this study, the length frequency distribution and length-weight relationship of 63 specimens between 58 cm (2808 g) and 82. 5 cm (7192 g) caught in Turkish waters in 2003 - 2004 was determined. In addition, total of 41 specimens caught in North Cypriot waters in 2001 were sampled. The fishing methods, the areas of catch, the seasons of catch, and the legislative measures in Turkish and North Cypriot waters were also investigated. RÉSUMÉ La thonine (Euthynnus alletteratus Raf. 1810) est capturée dans les eaux turques et au Nord de Chypre; cette espèce appartient à la famille des Scombridés et se trouve largement répartie dans le monde, notamment dans l’océan Atlantique, la Méditerranée et ses mers adjacentes.

40|$|The <b>black</b> <b>skipjack,</b> Euthynnus lineatus, uses a {{centrally}} located vascular heat exchanger to maintain core body temperatures warmer than ambient sea water. The heat exchanger {{is composed of}} the dorsal aorta, the posterior cardinal vein, and a large vertical rete.

Temperature-insensitive hemoglobin may function in warm-bodied fishes to prevent the premature dissociation of oxygen from hemoglobin as blood is warmed en route to the muscles...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} on the swordfish fishery in the Turkish Aegean Sea are presented. A total of 65 boats (6 - 14 m {{in length and}} 11. 5 - 135 hp in engine power) participated in this fishery from two main fishing ports, Sivrice and Fethiye, and the Datça-Bozburun Peninsula. This fishery is also carried out off Antalya Bay. The total annual swordfish catch was 425 t in 2005. The fishing period for swordfish normally takes place during eight months. However, the main activity is concentrated {{in the spring and}} summer seasons on moonless nights, because of the closed season (between October 1 and January 31) and adverse meteorological conditions. Although, there are various fishing gears and techniques for swordfish, the two main fishing gears used in the Aegean Sea are longline and driftnet. About ten non-target species, bluefin tuna, Atlantic <b>black</b> <b>skipjack,</b> albacore, Mediterranean spearfish, bullet tuna, dolphinfish, manta ray, sunfish, sharks and dolphins were determined from both longlining and drift-netting.

40|$|Spatial {{distribution}} and {{ecology of the}} larvae of three tuna species (Thunnus thynnus, Auxis rochei and Euthynnus alletteratus) were studied during an ichthyoplankton survey {{carried out in the}} Gulf of Gabes (Tunisia) in June and July 2009. A total of 80 stations, distributed on a regular sampling grid, were sampled. The main objectives of this survey were to provide information on tuna larvae distribution in the Gulf of Gabes in relation to the environmental parameters. Regarding small tunas, larvae of A. rochei (bullet tuna) showed the more widespread distribution, being found at both inshore and offshore stations. E. alletteratus (Atlantic <b>black</b> <b>skipjack)</b> larvae were mainly found at the inshore stations covering the wide continental shelf of this region. On the other hand, larvae of the large migratory tuna T. Thynnus (Atlantic bluefin tuna), were mainly recorded at offshore stations, suggesting that spawning possibly takes place mainly near the shelf break. Regarding the biological and physical parameters examined, our results indicate that tuna larvae were mainly collected in oligotrophic and mixed waters resulting from the confluence of surface water of recent Atlantic origin and resident surface Mediterranean waters, as shown by their preference for lower chlorophyll a concentrations (from 1. 4 to 2. 5 mg m- 3) and moderate salinity values (between 37. 35 and 37. 75). Significantly, tuna larvae seemed to avoid the more eutrophic and saltier waters of the gulf situated very close to the coast and around Kerkennah and Djerba islands...|$|E
40|$|An {{oceanographic survey}} {{was carried out}} {{during the summer of}} 2009, from June 25 to July 3 in the Gulf of Gabes. The study area is {{characterized}} by a wide continental shelf. A plankton sampling scheme was carried out to study the structure of the larval fish assemblages that characterizes the surface mixed layer, and to assess the influence of the environmental parameters on their spatial distribution. A total of 36 taxa were identified, 3 classified to the level of genus, 5 to family and 28 to species. The majority of identified fish larvae belonged to demersal species, mainly picarel Spicara smaris (23. 76 % of the total larval fish abundance), followed by red mullet Mullus barbatus (14. 92 %) and several species of the Sparidae family (9. 15 %). Small pelagic species as Sardinella Sardinella aurita and European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus were also abundant (27. 75 %) and dominated the fish larvae community in offshore stations. Five large pelagic species were found among the larvae, including bullet tuna Auxis rochei, Atlantic <b>black</b> <b>skipjack</b> Euthynnus alletteratus, albacore Thunnus alalunga, swordfish Xiphias gladius and the highly migratory Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus. All these apex predator species appear in 38. 5 % of the sampling stations and contribute about 7. 9 % of the total larval catches. The larval fish assemblage of the Gulf of Gabes is predominantly composed of neritic species in correspondence with the shallow depths of the study area. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that larval distributions were mainly conditioned by depth. However, other factors, like hydrographic processes, play also a very important role in shaping the spatial pattern of larval fish distribution...|$|E
40|$|The {{classification}} of the tunas {{throughout the world}} has remained unsatisfactory for many years due chiefly to the difficulties involved in comparing large specimens from many localities. On {{the eastern side of}} the Pacific are found several species which have not been clearly separated from those of the Western and Mid-Pacific. of these forms four play an important role in the fisheries of California, Mexico and Central America. The present study was undertaken in March 1940, to determine the geographical range of these species and the relationships between them and similar ones occurring in the Central, Western and Equatorial Pacific. This was the first essential step in a comprehensive investigation of the tuna populations supporting the California industry. In particular, it was necessary to explore the differences between the bluefin and the oriental tuna and to know whether or not the yellowfin tuna, the skipjack and the albacore are of the same species as those taken in Japanese and Hawaiian waters. If such proved to be the case additional studies would be required to determine if any intermingling occurred between the populations in the different localities. If on the other hand, the species proved to be distinct the Eastern Pacific population might be exploited without regard to the fisheries of Hawaii and Japan. The only comprehensive work on the systematics of the Pacific tunas was published by Kishinouye. He found that separation of the various species required a careful study of the anatomy of these fish. To follow the approach laid down in his paper, a similar detailed anatomical treatment of the problem was required to compare those species supporting the California fishery with Kishinouye's descriptions. Although this work appears to be principally morphological, the great detail in which the anatomy of the Eastern Pacific tunas has been studied will form a firm foundation upon which investigations may be extended into lines more directly applicable to conservation. Concerning the skipjack, this work has demonstrated that within the entire fishing area in the Eastern Pacific extending along the Central and North American coastline from the Equator to California and off-shore to include all the outlying islands, there is but a single species, and specimens from all these areas are furthermore individually indistinguishable from those obtained from Japan and the Hawaiian Islands and described as Katsuwonus pelamis. In the case of the yellowfin tuna a similar conclusion was reached. A single species, Neothunnus macropterus, exists throughout this fishing area, and these fish are individually indistinguishable from the specimens obtained from the Hawaiian Islands, from Japan and from Peru. Here again the range of the species spans the Pacific and extends southward to Callao, on the Peruvian coast. Within this large area distinct populations may exist, but conclusions concerning this must await the analysis of all the data collected. The albacore obtained from Japan and from the Hawaiian Islands likewise proved to be similar to the fish of the North American coastline. All must be considered of the same species, Thunnus germo, with a geographical distribution extending across the north temperate Pacific. The authors agree with Kishinouye that the albacore belongs in the genus Thunnus, and should not be separated therefrom. The bluefin tuna from Southern and Lower California are essentially one species, and until adequate descriptions are available from all localities, must be assigned to the same species as Thunnus thynnus of the Atlantic. Similarly, lacking material from Japan with which to compare directly the local specimens, it was necessary to base this comparison upon these findings and Kishinouye's description of Thunnus orientalis. Although very similar to Thunnus thynnus, T. orientalis (the oriental bluefin) as described by Kishinouye, differs in several respects from the local bluefin, and pending a direct comparison it must be concluded, tentatively, that the two are different, and that the local species is limited in distribution in the Pacific to the Eastern, temperate waters. Lack of time prevented similar studies on the bonito, Sarda velox and S. lineolata, and on the <b>black</b> <b>skipjack,</b> Euthynnus lineatus. It is hoped that these forms may be investigated at some future date. These species are not reported, however, from Mid- and Western Pacific waters and their distribution does not present as great complexities as the other four species mentioned above. Reports from fishermen and an observation by Kishinouye concerning the occurrence of Parathunnus mebachi, in the Eastern Pacific have been confirmed. This fish is very similar to the yellowfin tuna, but differs from it in outline, in the length of the pectoral and the size of the head and eye. The body and head are deeper than in the yellowfin, the pectoral is longer and the eye is conspicuously larger. For this reason, and because the specific name means, in Japanese, "big-eye," we suggest as a common name for this fish, the "big-eyed tuna. " The name is descriptive, and is, moreover, commonly applied by fishermen to this fish. The species was first described by Kishinouye from Japanese waters. Except that it is taken occasionally at the Galapagos Islands and sometimes at Guadalupe Island (Mexico) and in the vicinity, nothing is known of its habitat on this coast. Kishinouye states, p. 444, that it is: "probably widely distributed in the deeper layer of the subtropical region of the Pacific Ocean. " The existing literature does not permit a positive identification of the Pacific tunas. Thus, Jordan and Evermann separate the yellowfin into two species on the basis of the height of the "dorsal and anal lobes," and the length of the pectoral fin. Neothunnus macropterus, with higher dorsal and anal lobes and a longer pectoral, is supposedly abundant "along the coast of tropical Mexico from Cape San Lucas to the Galapagos * * *," whereas N. catalinae, "* * * the northern representative of Neothunnus macropterus, is like the latter in almost all respects except that the fins are less developed. " However, there is no justification for this separation and it is impossible to classify any given specimen on this basis. Kishinouye's monograph, "Contributions to the Comparative Study of the So-called Scombroid Fishes," contains the most complete descriptions extant of the Pacific tunas. When, however, specimens of yellowfin tuna from the American coast were compared with his description of N. macropterus, a number of important differences were found superimposed upon a general, fundamental similarity. To identify positively the yellowfin of this coast, and thus determine the geographical range of the species, it was necessary to secure specimens from Japan for a direct comparison. The results of this comparison indicated a number of discrepancies in Kishinouye's work. These will be discussed when necessary in the text. Specimens of yellowfin tuna, skipjack and albacore were obtained from Japan and the Hawaiian Islands. Specimens of yellowfin tuna only were obtained from Peru. In regard to the origin of these fishes, the Hawaiian specimens were taken in the vicinity of Honolulu, and the Peruvian yellowfin were shipped from, and probably caught in the proximity of, Callao; but of the Japanese specimens it is known only that they were shipped by freight from Japan. This material was compared directly with a large collection of local specimens collected in the course of research trips aboard the "N. B. Scofield" to all parts of the extensive local fishing grounds. All specimens were frozen and retained in cold storage until needed. A comparison of the bluefin tuna from California and from Lower California was also made, and the big-eyed tuna is described for the first time from this coast. Preparatory to this work a study was made of the literature and in particular of Kishinouye's monograph, and a list of all characters used in the {{classification of}} the tunas was compiled. Preliminary dissections of local specimens were then made and characters offering little promise and those not amenable to routine examination were rejected, and others added. The final list was then organized into a procedure standard for the dissection of each species, and a corresponding blank was prepared for every specimen. The method proved very satisfactory and is heartily recommended because it insures continuity and comparability of observations throughout. The comparisons were made as exhaustive as circumstances permitted, in the hope that this publication might serve as a basis for a thorough and permanent classification of the Pacific tunas. Foreseeing the necessity of a more detailed population study of some species, a large number of both external and internal measurements and counts was added to the routine. These, however, will be reserved for a biometrical analysis in a future publication and not discussed herein. In addition routine sketches were made of every organ system examined and the final illustrations were prepared from these without embellishment. of the five species investigated, a representative specimen from each widely separated area (Japan, Hawaii, local, etc.), was photographed...|$|E
