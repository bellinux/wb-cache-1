50|$|Professor <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> {{was also}} known as a fearlessly outspoken critic of {{successive}} military juntas of Burma, and, for not toeing to the official line {{when it comes to the}} history of Burma. <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> often criticized the generals for attempting to rewrite the history of Burma according to the requirements of their propagandas, and his well-researched books on Burma, had often been banned by the authorities or sidelined by publishers for fear of punishments from the paranoid generals.|$|R
50|$|When Ba Maw's pro-Japanese {{government}} {{was established in}} 1942, <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> served as Minister of Land and Agriculture, and he met and married Khin Gyi, sister of Aung San Suu Kyi's mother Khin Kyi. Aung San married Khin Kyi {{about the same time}} shortly after he became Minister of War; the BIA was renamed the Burma Defence Army (BDA). <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> could pass on Japanese intelligence to Thakin Soe who had gone underground in the Delta region in order to organise resistance against the Japanese Occupation. Thakins Thein Pe and Tin Shwe were sent to India to make contact with the British colonial government in exile at Simla. At the end of World War II, after the Japanese had been defeated and the British had returned, <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> became general secretary of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) formed by the CPB, the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP, later renamed the Socialist Party) and the BDA, now renamed the Burma National Army (BNA) and led by his brother-in-law Aung San. <b>Than</b> <b>Tun,</b> unlike Aung San, was not among the six men who founded the CPB on August 15, 1939; Aung San was its first secretary general, with Thakin Soe in charge of mass organisation.|$|R
50|$|In 2000 Fukuoka Asian Culture prize Committee awarded Professor <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> {{the highest}} {{worldwide}} academic award, a Literate of the 11th Fukuoka Asian Culture Prizes in the Academic Prize Category.|$|R
50|$|As an {{organizer}} in Insein District for Dobama Poor Man organization, he undertook secret {{organization for the}} resistance against the Japanese occupation, by communicating with Thakin <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> and Thakin Chit.|$|R
50|$|Professor <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> {{died at the}} age of 83 in 2005 after {{attending}} his close friend, and famous writer Ludu Daw Amar’s birthday party at Taung Lay Lone monastery in Mandalay.|$|R
50|$|She {{was born}} to <b>Tun</b> Shwe and <b>Than</b> Tin in Rangoon, Burma, the {{youngest}} of four children. She attended Methodist English High School and enrolled at Rangoon University for higher education.|$|R
50|$|Thakins <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> and Soe, {{while in}} Insein prison in July 1941, had co-authored the Insein Manifesto which, against the {{prevailing}} {{opinion in the}} Dobama movement, identified world fascism as the main enemy in the coming war and called for temporary co-operation with the British in a broad allied coalition which should include the Soviet Union. Soe had already gone underground to organise resistance against the Japanese occupation, and <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> was able to pass on Japanese intelligence to Soe, while other Communist leaders Thakins Thein Pe and Tin Shwe made contact with the exiled colonial government in Simla, India.|$|R
50|$|<b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> was {{the only}} {{politician}} that nearly matched Aung San in status among his contemporaries and even the British noticed early on {{that he was the}} thinker behind Aung San. He first made his name as the schoolteacher who wrote powerful speeches in both Burmese and English. As a political organiser his skills were unequalled and he had played a pre-eminent role at every stage of Burma's struggle for independence. He was no mere ideologue but a man of extraordinary achievement and energy. <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> has come to be regarded as a fallen idol in the modern history of Burma.|$|R
50|$|Thakin <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> (သခင် သန်းထွန်း) (1911-September 24, 1968) born in Kanyutkwin, British Burma, was a Burmese {{politician}} {{and leader of}} the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) from 1945 until his murder at age 57.|$|R
5000|$|Independence was {{declared}} on January 4, 1948, with the AFPFL, now {{dominated by the}} Socialist Party, in power, and U Nu became prime minister, now that Aung San had been assassinated along with most of his cabinet on July 19, 1947, commemorated since as Martyrs' Day. The CPB was charged with inciting revolt after organising a series of strikes and mass rallies, and orders were issued to arrest the leadership on March 28, 1948. <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> escaped and led his party underground in order to organize armed revolution, and established guerrilla bases in central Burma from the CPB stronghold at Pyinmana. <b>Than</b> <b>Tun,</b> now Chairman of the CPB, sent a number of party members to China to be trained by Chinese revolutionaries. Some of them returned for the peace parley of 1963 when the CPB sent a delegation to Rangoon {{to negotiate with the}} Revolutionary Council government headed by General Ne Win. <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> himself remained in the jungle and was reunited with the so-called [...] "Peking returnees" [...] after the peace talks broke down.|$|R
50|$|The AFPFL was a {{political}} alliance comprising several very different political parties held together by the common leadership of first Aung San and then U Nu. Its first general secretary was the communist leader Thakin <b>Than</b> <b>Tun.</b>|$|R
25|$|While he was War Minister in 1942, Aung San met {{and married}} Khin Kyi, and {{around the same time}} her sister {{met and married}} Thakin <b>Than</b> <b>Tun,</b> the Communist leader. Aung San and Khin Kyi had four children.|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s Goshal was denounced in an inner-party purge, {{labelled}} 'the Liu Shaoqi of Burma' {{and executed}} in the Pegu Yoma on 18 June 1967. He {{had been on}} the losing side in a factional conflict following the return of a section of the party leadership that had been exiled in Beijing. He lost an important vote at the Communist Party politburo meeting of June 1965, where he had argued against Thakin Than Tun's proposal to organize a new party school (Thakin <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> had returned from Beijing, whilst Goshal had been a leader of the party inside Burma. Thakin <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> had proposed setting up a new party school, with teachers trained in China).|$|R
2500|$|It {{soon became}} {{apparent}} that Japanese promises of independence were merely a sham and that Ba Maw was deceived. [...] As the war turned against the Japanese, they declared Burma a fully sovereign state on 1 August 1943, but this was just another facade. [...] Disillusioned, Aung San began negotiations with Communist leaders Thakin <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> and Thakin Soe, and Socialist leaders Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein {{which led to the}} formation of the Anti-Fascist Organisation (AFO) in August 1944 at a secret meeting of the CPB, the PRP and the BNA in Pegu. The AFO was later renamed the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League(AFPFL). Thakin <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> and Soe, while in Insein prison in July 1941, had co-authored the Insein Manifesto which, against the prevailing opinion in the Dobama movement, identified world fascism as the main enemy in the coming war and called for temporary co-operation with the British in a broad allied coalition which should include the Soviet Union.

50|$|Dr. <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> {{became a}} {{lecturer}} in University of Rangoon’s Department of History and Political Science in 1959. In 1965, {{he was promoted}} to the Professor and Head of Department in History at University of Mandalay. Professor <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> left Mandalay in 1982 for University of Tokyo’s Department of South East Asian Studies where he was a Research Fellow and Visiting Professor from 1982 to 1987. Later, he was a visiting professor in Northern Illinois University where he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Literature in 1988. From 1989 to 1990, he was a visiting scholar at the University of Michigan. In 1990 he came back to Burma and worked as a Member of the Myanmar (Burmese) Historical Commission and Emeritus Professor in University of Yangon in the Departments of History and Archeology.|$|R
50|$|Whilst in Insein {{prison in}} July 1941, CPB leaders Thakin <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> and Thakin Soe had co-authored the Insein Manifesto, which, against the {{prevailing}} {{opinion in the}} Burmese nationalist movement led by the Dobama Asiayone, identified world fascism as the main enemy in the coming war and called for temporary cooperation with the British in a broad allied coalition that included the Soviet Union. Soe had already gone underground to organise resistance against the Japanese occupation, and <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> as Minister of Land and Agriculture was able to pass on Japanese intelligence to Soe, while other Communist leaders Thakin Thein Pe and Thakin Tin Shwe made contact with the exiled colonial government in Simla, India. Aung San was War Minister in the puppet administration set up on 1 August 1943 which also included the Socialist leaders Thakin Nu and Thakin Mya.|$|R
50|$|The party {{emerged from}} a split in the Communist Party of Burma in February 1946. Thakin Soe, a former guerrilla leader, had staked claims for the {{leadership}} of the party. He denounced Thakin <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> and Thakin Thein Pe as 'Browderists', charging that the two had taken a compromising stand towards imperialism and opportunistic elements.|$|R

25|$|The AFPFL {{opposed the}} government, leading to {{political}} {{instability in the}} country.

5000|$|Naratheinga Uzana (နရသိင်္ဃ ဥဇနာ, {{also known}} as Naratheinkha Uzana; 1190s-1235) was the regent of Pagan from c. 1231 to 1235. He was crown prince prior to his regency. He is {{regarded}} by some historians G.H. Luce and <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> as king between 1231 and 1235 but others Htin Aung and Michael Aung-Thwin do not accept him as king.|$|R
50|$|Ba Maw was {{afterwards}} declared head of state, and {{his cabinet}} included both Aung San as War Minister and the Communist leader Thakin <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> as Minister of Land and Agriculture {{as well as}} the Socialist leaders Thakins Nu and Mya. When the Japanese declared Burma, in theory, independent in 1943, the Burma Defence Army (BDA) was renamed the Burma National Army (BNA).|$|R
5000|$|Shin Saw (ရှင်စော, {{also known}} as Asaw ( [...] , [...] )) was the chief wife of Prince Naratheinga Uzana of Pagan. Naratheinga is {{regarded}} by some historians such as G.H.

Some historians such as Htin Aung and Michael Aung-Thwin do not recognize Naratheinga as king.|$|R
5000|$|When Thakin Soe's Red Flag Communist Party (Alan Ni Party) {{split from}} the Communist Party of Burma in early 1946, accusing it of revisionism—"Browderism", named after Earl Browder, {{leader of the}} Communist Party of the United States of America—and went underground, <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> and the {{majority}} of Communists continued to cooperate with the AFPFL. However, the rift over strategy, whether to negotiate with the postwar colonial administration or to continue with the threat of general strikes and armed rebellion till full independence was achieved, came to a head after Aung San and others accepted seats in the Executive Council. In July 1946, <b>Than</b> <b>Tun</b> was forced to resign as general secretary, and the CPB, now dubbed the [...] "White Flag" [...] faction, expelled from the AFPFL the following October, after the CPB had accused Aung San and others of selling out to the British and settling for a [...] "sham" [...] independence.|$|R
