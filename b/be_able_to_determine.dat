5|$|On March 31, 2009, a {{full-length}} DVD-quality workprint {{of the film}} without a timecode or watermark, with some unfinished effects shots, a different typeface for titles and casting, and alternate sound effects was leaked online. The studio said it would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> {{the source of the}} leak using forensic marks in the workprint. The FBI and MPAA began investigating the illegal posting. Fox estimated the workprint was downloaded roughly 4.5million times by the time Wolverine was released in theaters. As of 2014, Fox estimates that a minimum of 15 million people downloaded it.|$|E
5|$|Women in {{homosexual}} relationships {{responded to}} this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and identity that developed in Europe and the United States. Following World War II, {{during a period of}} social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals, women developed networks to socialize with and educate each other. Greater economic and social freedom allowed them gradually to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> how they could form relationships and families. With second wave feminism and growth of scholarship in women's history and sexuality in the 20th century, the definition of lesbian broadened, sparking a debate about sexual desire as the major component to define what a lesbian is. Some women who engage in same-sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as bisexual as well, while other women's self-identification as lesbian may not align with their sexual orientation or sexual behavior; sexual identity is not necessarily the same as one's sexual orientation or sexual behavior, due to various reasons, such as the fear of identifying their sexual orientation in a homophobic setting.|$|E

25|$|Phishers are {{targeting}} the customers of banks and online payment services. Emails, supposedly from the Internal Revenue Service, {{have been used}} to glean sensitive data from U.S. taxpayers. While the first such examples were sent indiscriminately in the expectation that some would be received by customers of a given bank or service, recent research has shown that phishers may in principle <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> which banks potential victims use, and target bogus emails accordingly.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, if {{materials}} {{have failed to}} dry out several days after the suspected water event, mold growth is suspected within wall cavities {{even if it is}} not immediately visible. Through a mold investigation, which may include destructive inspection, one should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> {{the presence or absence of}} mold. In a situation where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been compromised, mold remediation may be needed. Mold testing and inspections should be carried out by an independent investigator to avoid any conflict of interest and to insure accurate results; free mold testing offered by remediation companies is not recommended.|$|E
25|$|More subtly, {{we should}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> our next action {{based on the}} results of {{previous}} actions. To do this, Haskell has an operator >>= (pronounced bind) with type IO a → (a → IOnbsp&b) → IOnbsp&b. That is, the operand on the left is an I/O action that returns a value of type a; the operand on the right is a function that can pick an I/O action based on the value produced by the action on the left. The resulting combined action, when performed, performs the first action, then evaluates the function with the first action's return value, then performs the second action, and finally returns the second action's value.|$|E

25|$|For {{the purpose}} of setting {{treatment}} standards and reuse legislation, {{it is important to}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the amount of helminth eggs in an environmental sample with some accuracy. The detection of viable helminth eggs in samples of wastewater, sludge or fresh feces (as a diagnostic tool for the infection helminthiasis) is not straight forward. In fact, many laboratories in developing countries lack the right equipment or skilled staff required to do so. An important step in the analytical methods is usually the concentration of the eggs in the sample, {{especially in the case of}} wastewater samples. A concentration step may not be required in samples of dried feces, e.g. samples collected from urine-diverting dry toilets.|$|E
25|$|A related finding {{indicates}} that slightly older infants can acquire both lexical and grammatical regularities {{from a single}} set of input, suggesting {{that they are able}} to use outputs of one type of statistical learning (cues that lead to the discovery of word boundaries) as input to a second type (cues that lead to the discovery of syntactical regularities. At test, 12-month-olds preferred to listen to sentences that had the same grammatical structure as the artificial language they had been tested on rather than sentences that had a different (ungrammatical) structure. Because learning grammatical regularities requires infants to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> boundaries between individual words, this {{indicates that}} infants who are still quite young are able to acquire multiple levels of language knowledge (both lexical and syntactical) simultaneously, indicating that statistical learning is a powerful mechanism at play in language learning.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} sit upright was an {{important}} requirement for test animals in order that another common fatal injury among human victims, decapitation, could be studied. Additionally, {{it was important for}} researchers to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> to what extent cabin design needed to be modified to ensure optimal survival circumstances. For instance, a dashboard with too little padding or padding which was too stiff or too soft would not significantly reduce head injury over a dash with no padding at all. While knobs, levers, and buttons are essential in the operation of a vehicle, which design modifications would best ensure that these elements did not tear or puncture victims in a crash. Rear-view mirror impact is a significant occurrence in a frontal collision; how should a mirror be built so that it is both rigid enough to perform its task and yet of low injury risk if struck.|$|E

25|$|Controllability and {{observability}} are main {{issues in}} the analysis of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal {{will ever be able to}} control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed stabilizable. Observability instead is related to the possibility of observing, through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller will never <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Rae wrote {{a report}} for the Liberal {{government}} of Dalton McGuinty on post-secondary education, {{commonly referred to as}} the Rae Report. His report called for increased government funding to colleges and universities, and enhanced student aid especially for low-income students. The report also suggested that individual institutions ought to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> what rate of tuition fees to charge, free from government controls, which generated controversy. Student groups including the Canadian Federation of Students have objected, noting the significant recent increases in tuition fees in Ontario under the government of Mike Harris, and the 57 per cent increase in tuition fees during Rae's own tenure as premier. Ontario NDP leader Howard Hampton also criticized the report. Rae defended his report, arguing that low income non-university individuals would not benefit from a tuition freeze/lowering, as well as being forced to bear the tax burden needed to enact it.|$|E
25|$|Taste {{opens with}} Lady Pentweazel who {{believes}} that the works of art, the Venus de' Medici and the Mary de Medici, are sisters in the Medici family. Two other collectors, Novice and Lord Dupe, claim to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the age and value of coins and medals by tasting them while Puff, an auctioneer, convinces them and Sir Positive Bubble that broken china and statuary are worth far more than perfect pieces. Lord Dupe follows this advice by purchasing a canvas with the paint scraped off. The foibles of ignorant art collectors and predatory dealers were presented by Foote in this high burlesque comedy. In order for an audience to appreciate high burlesque, they must understand the standards of true taste before they can recognize the conflict between those standards and the characters. The audience that saw the premier of Taste evidently did not understand this conflict as the play was not successful and only played five performances.|$|E

25|$|Another rather strange {{chapter of}} nineteenth century science that is {{relevant}} {{with regard to}} Egyptomania is Craniology, {{the study of the}} human cranium that claimed to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> an individual's intelligence and even character. Egyptian mummies served as an abundant source for the object of study— skulls. Craniology was especially important with regard of the question, whether Egyptians were black or white, a debate lead in light of the justification of slavery. The key figure for this period seems to be Samuel George Morton who founded the American School of Ethnology. He put forward the theory of Polygenesis claiming that there is not one but several human races who are in a hierarchical order with whites at the top and blacks at the bottom end of the scale. Although science today disapproves of Morton's findings it still revalidated his professional status, because Morton's American School was to a large degree responsible {{for the development of the}} current professional status of the sciences and the renunciation of puritan ideas of monogenesis and the Christian, clerical worldview, common at the time.|$|E
500|$|Durkheim's monograph, Suicide (1897) is {{considered}} a seminal work in statistical analysis by contemporary sociologists. Suicide is {{a case study of}} variations in suicide rates among Catholic and Protestant populations, and served to distinguish sociological analysis from psychology or philosophy. It also marked a major contribution to the theoretical concept of structural functionalism. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than that of Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or psychological) causes. He developed the notion of objective sui generis [...] "social facts" [...] to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study. Through such studies he posited that sociology would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether any given society is 'healthy' or 'pathological', and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or [...] "social anomie".|$|E
500|$|To {{break the}} {{deadlock}} over verification, Macmillan proposed a compromise in February 1959 whereby {{each of the}} original parties {{would be subject to}} a set number of on-site inspections each year. In May 1959, Khrushchev and Eisenhower agreed to explore Macmillan's quota proposal, though Eisenhower made further test-ban negotiations conditional on the Soviet Union dropping its Control Commission veto demand and participating in technical discussions on identification of high-altitude nuclear explosions. Khrushchev agreed to the latter and was noncommittal on the former. A working group in Geneva would eventually devise a costly system of 5–6 satellites orbiting at least [...] above the earth, though it could not say with certainty that such a system would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the origin of a high-altitude test. US negotiators also questioned whether high-altitude tests could evade detection via radiation shielding. Concerning Macmillan's compromise, the Soviet Union privately suggested it would accept a quota of three inspections per year. The US argued that the quota should be set according to scientific necessity (i.e., be set according to the frequency of seismic events).|$|E
