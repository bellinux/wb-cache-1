5|$|Coal balls often {{preserve}} a remarkable {{record of the}} microscopic tissue structure of Carboniferous swamp and mire plants, which would otherwise have <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed. Their unique preservation of Carboniferous plants makes them valuable to scientists, who cut and peel the coal balls to research the geological past.|$|E
5|$|Constantinople and {{neighboring}} provinces also suffered extensive damage.

40|$|We study a {{class of}} t-designs which enjoy {{a high degree of}} regularity. These are the subsets of {{vertices}} of the Johnson graph which <b>are</b> <b>completely</b> regular, in the sense of Delsarte [3]. After setting up the basic theory, we describe the known completely regular designs. We derive very strong restrictions which must hold in order for a design to <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> regular. As a result, we <b>are</b> able to <b>completely</b> determine which symmetric designs <b>are</b> <b>completely</b> regular and which Steiner systems with t = 2 <b>are</b> <b>completely</b> regular...|$|R

5|$|Quarrying ceased in {{the early}} 1960s (1962–1965), when the stones {{extracted}} were no longer of sufficient quality.

5|$|The {{fair amount}} of {{isolated}} fragments and sculptures testify to the many lost works and those that reached us only incompletely, which were clearly of considerable artistic merit.

5|$|A {{shortage}} of 9mm ammunition for the Owen Guns was discovered, apparently because the ammunition {{was in the}} LST that had not <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> unloaded. An emergency airdrop was requested at 10:30. In Port Moresby, the 1st Air Maintenance Company prepared 30 parachutes, each attached to two boxes containing 2,560 rounds of 9mm ammunition, a total of 153,600 rounds. This was loaded onto three USAAF B-24 Liberator bombers at Wards Airfield that took off at 16:55. They arrived over the Finschhafen area after dark at 19:15, where a drop zone in a Kunai patch was marked by men holding hand torches. Of the 115,000 rounds that were dropped, about 112,000 were recovered.|$|E
