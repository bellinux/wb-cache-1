5|$|Vettel {{extended}} his lead to 13 seconds when Hamilton lost time due to struggling {{to pass the}} lapped cars of Senna and Glock. Glock attempted to pass Senna around the outside heading into the first corner {{but was unable to}} move ahead. On lap 37, Glock again attempted to overtake Senna but the two cars collided. The incident caused a puncture on Glock's car that very nearly threw him into the wall and forced him to make a pit stop, though his crew were not ready for him and he lost several seconds as the tyres were brought out. Senna remained on the circuit with a damaged front wing, and made a pit stop on the next lap. Sutil overtook Buemi for seventh place on lap 40. Hamilton was eight tenths of a second quicker than race leader Vettel on the same lap and reduced the gap to 11.9 seconds. Hülkenberg's car emitted <b>blue</b> <b>smoke</b> from the rear on the next lap but disappeared on the 42nd lap. It was announced two laps later that Button, Barrichello, Hülkenberg, Kubica, Petrov, Liuzzi, Sutil, Buemi and de la Rosa were under investigation for exceeding the speed limit during the safety car period.|$|E

In 2007, Lifetime Television adapted four Nora Roberts novels into TV movies: Angels Fall starring Heather Locklear, Montana Sky starring Ashley Williams, <b>Blue</b> <b>Smoke</b> starring Alicia Witt, and Carolina Moon starring Claire Forlani.

25|$|The {{development}} {{consists of}} roughly five major sections. Traveling north to south, the first neighborhood has high-rise residential buildings, the Stuyvesant High School, a Regal Entertainment Group movie theater, and the Battery Park City {{branch of the}} New York Public Library. It is also {{the site of the}} 463-suite Conrad New York luxury hotel, which contains restaurants and bars such as the Loopy Doopy Rooftop Bar, ATRIO Wine Bar Restaurant, Mexican-themed El Vez, and three Danny Meyer-branded restaurants (North End Grill, <b>Blue</b> <b>Smoke,</b> Shake Shack); the hotel has a ballroom and a conference center. Other restaurants located in that hotel, as well as a DSW store and a New York Sports Club branch, were closed in 2009 after the takeover of the property by Goldman Sachs. Former undeveloped lots in the area have been developed into high-rise buildings; for example, Goldman Sachs built a new headquarters at 200 West Street.|$|E

2500|$|... 1961 saw the {{introduction}} of the so-called Clean Oil Regulator “Frischölautomatik”, a system incorporating a separate oil tank and pump to dispense the oil which, in a two-stroke engine, is mixed with the fuel ahead of combustion. The stated purpose was to reduce the characteristic <b>blue</b> <b>smoke</b> emission for which the car was known. This was to be achieved by ensuring that oil was introduced in exactly the correct 1:40 proportion to the fuel, and the device was advertised as a way to improve engine longevity. The timing of this innovation proved unfortunate as the winter of 1962-63 was an exceptionally cold one in Europe. The Auto Union 1000 model experienced an unexpected increase in crankshaft damage because the oil, its viscosity affected by the cold weather, was unable to flow freely through the narrow feeder pipe in the carburettor.|$|E
2500|$|The Kecksburg UFO {{incident}} occurred on December 9, 1965, at Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, United States. A large, brilliant fireball {{was seen by}} thousands in at least six U.S. states and Ontario, Canada. It streaked over the Detroit, Michigan – Windsor, Canada area, reportedly dropped hot metal debris over Michigan and northern Ohio, starting some grass fires, and caused sonic booms in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. It was generally assumed and reported by the press to be a meteor after authorities discounted other proposed explanations such as a plane crash, errant missile test, or reentering satellite debris. However, eyewitnesses in the small village of Kecksburg, about 30 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, claimed something crashed in the woods. A boy said he saw the object land; his mother saw a wisp of <b>blue</b> <b>smoke</b> arising from the woods and alerted authorities. Another reported feeling a vibration and [...] "a thump" [...] {{about the time the}} object reportedly landed. Others from Kecksburg, including local volunteer fire department members, reported finding an object in the shape of an acorn and about as large as a Volkswagen Beetle. Writing resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs was also said to be in a band {{around the base of the}} object. Witnesses further reported that intense military presence, most notably the United States Army, secured the area, ordered civilians out, and then removed an object on a flatbed truck. The military claimed they searched the woods and found [...] "absolutely nothing." ...|$|E
