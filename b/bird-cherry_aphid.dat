40|$|Systemic grass fungal endophytes {{have been}} {{suggested}} to form a mutualistic relationship with their host plants (Clay 1988). Endophytes live asymptomatically within the host tis-sues, receiving protection, nutrients, and vertical transmission to the next plant generation via host seeds. The plant may benefit from endophyte infection through improved drought and flooding tolerance, increased biomass production and improved herbivore resistance, resulting in the improved competitive ability of endophyte-infected individuals compared to uninfected conspecifics. Grass endophytes were first noted because they caused health disorders in livestock grazing on infected forage in the USA and New Zealand in the mid- 20 th century (Ball 1993). Grass endophytes {{have been shown to}} be able to produce toxic alkaloids, thereby negatively affecting a wide variety of invertebrate and vertebrate herbi-vores (Schardl and Phillips 1997). The focus of endophyte studies has been on tall fescue (Festuca elatior = Festuca arundinacea) and mostly, on its cultivar Kentucky 31. We examined how endophyte infection and nutrient availability affects the performance of <b>bird-cherry</b> <b>aphid</b> (Rhopalosiphum padi) in meadow fescue (Lolium pratense = Festuca pratensis).

40|$|Most aphid species Hemiptera: Aphididae are {{parthenogenetic}} between {{periods of}} sexual reproduction. They are also highly polyphenic, with different adult morphs {{occurring in the}} life cycle, piz. winged, wingless, asexual and sexual. It is assumed that aphids born in a parthenogenetic clonal lineage are genetically identical regardless of the final adult form {{with the exception of}} sexual forms). Using the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) we have found that different asexual adult phenotypes winged and wingless of some clones of two cereal aphid species (the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (F.) and the <b>bird-cherry</b> <b>aphid.</b> Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) may be distinguished by {{the presence or absence of}} one or more RAPD-PCR bands. In three of nine clones examined, such differences were found, and Southern blotting and hybridization of the discriminating bands confirmed these to be of aphid origin, rather than due to endosymbiotic bacteria or contaminating fungi. The main 248 and 296 bp bands, in the two species respectively, were sequenced and found to be A/T rich. The smaller band showed 57 % homology with white striated muscle over a stretch of 90 bp. Genomic DNA treated with dimethyl sulphoxide to remove secondary structures still showed differences in RAPD-PCR profiles between winged and wingless morphs within the unusual clones. This discovery may be widespread and therefore it is important to understand the phenomenon in relation to clonal organisms...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBarley yellow dwarf virus-PAV (BYDV-PAV) is a luteovirus {{transmitted}} between {{plants by}} phloem-feeding aphids (e. g. the <b>bird-cherry</b> oat <b>aphid,</b> Rhopalosiphum padi). BYDV-PAV {{is associated with}} yellow dwarf disease in commercial cereals crops (e. g. wheat), often resulting in significant losses of grain yield and quality. Although {{there has been much}} study on the effect of predicted future elevated atmospheric CO 2 (eCO 2) on plants, the impact on plant-virus interactions is relatively understudied. The effect of eCO 2 on the growth, physiology and antioxidant defence systems of BYDV-infected wheat may impact the success of different cereal cultivars in the future. In particular, antioxidants ascorbic acid and glutathione are involved in the plant antioxidant defence system that regulates potentially harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with plant host-virus interactions. This project compared host symptom expression and antioxidant defence systems of two susceptible (Triticum aestivum cv. Yitpi and Revenue) cultivars and a recently released BYDV-resistant (T. aestivum cv. Manning) cultivar of Australian wheat, artificially infected with BYDV-PAV using the aphid vector R. padi, and grown under eCO 2 in growth chambers and in the field-based Australian Grains Free Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (AGFACE) facility in Horsham, Victoria, Australia. BYDV-infection was associated with changes in biomass, total antioxidants, and the proportion of oxidised and reduced antioxidants. Data suggests a disruption of plant antioxidant processes with infection, which could lead to greater vulnerability to further biotic or abiotic stresses. A comparison of infection under eCO 2 of cultivars with variable susceptibility to plant viruses may provide useful information in selection for future breeding for a changing climate...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{possess a}} complex and poorly {{understood}} network of defence mechanisms {{that enable them to}} counteract the effects of abiotic and biotic stress. Aphid phloem feeding is source of biotic stress in plants. Russian wheat aphid and Bird Cherry-Oat aphid feeding cause significant losses in the annual wheat crop, and control by conventional methods such as pesticide application, has proved to be ineffective. Infestation by the Russian wheat aphid has a particularly devastating effect in South Africa. Aphid-resistant wheat cultivars have been identified but an incomplete understanding of the mechanism of the plant’s resistance thwarts the development of improved cultivars. A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method was developed, partially optimised and validated {{in order to determine the}} effect of Russian wheat aphid and Bird Cherry-Oat aphid phloem feeding on the Betta and Betta DN wheat proteome. Differentially expressed proteins that were up or down regulated more than two fold were identified using PDQuest™ Basic software and matched to known wheat proteins stored in the SwissProt protein database on the basis of their molecular mass and isolectric point. Initial analysis of the differential protein expression of Betta and Betta DN wheat in response to Russian wheat aphid and Bird Cherry-Oat aphid phloem feeding at different growth stages revealed that younger plants display higher levels of resistance than older plants. Feeding by the <b>Bird-Cherry</b> Oat <b>aphid</b> does not result in the upregulation of proteins implicated in a defence response, which indicates that the damage incurred by the plant due to feeding by this aphid is not enough to trigger a classic defence response. Feeding by the more damaging Russian wheat aphid resulted in a stress response in susceptible wheat cultivar Betta, and a defence response in resistant wheat cultivar Betta DN. The infestation of Betta DN resulted in the upregulation of putative thaumatins and amylase trypsin inhibitors, indicating that the Betta DN resistance response could be due to the combined effect of protease inhibitors that discourage aphid phloem feeding and the activation of the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid plant defence pathways...|$|R

MadlPraveen VadlaniProducers {{of whole}} wheat {{products}} {{are interested in}} marketing the health-promoting benefits of wheat antioxidants. However, they need a steady crop supply with consistent levels of antioxidants. The variable phenolic content in wheat crops is a problem. The objectives of this research were to 1) identify the factor (s) that contribute the most to the variability in phenolic content, 2) understand the mechanism (s) responsible for phenolic synthesis, and 3) artificially trigger that mechanism (s). Phenolics are hypothesized {{to be part of}} the defense response of hard red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L) to stress. The effect of insect feeding, pathogen infection, and heat stress on phenolics in grains from wheat plants cv. Karl 92 was evaluated. <b>Bird-cherry</b> oat <b>aphid</b> (Rhopalosiphum padi) feeding stress significantly explained the variation in phenolic content. Furthermore, the relative allocation of carbon resources to grain yield/phenolic content was influenced by the stage of the plant at which aphid feeding started to occur. Based on these findings, phenolics were hypothesized to be an active defense response acting through a mechanism known as systemic acquired resistance (SAR). In order to prove this hypothesis, several synthetic elicitors of SAR were tested for their effectiveness at inducing de novo phenolic synthesis in wheat foliage and in mature grains. Elicitors that acted through the salicylic- and jasmonic acid signaling pathways were effective at inducing phenolic synthesis by 49 % and 177 %, respectively, in the leaves 36 hours post spray application. They also elicited a phenolic response in mature grains of up to 21 % induction. Enhancement of the levels of naturally occurring phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity in wheat grains through SAR activation is a value addition strategy that can potentially increase the profitability of hard red winter wheat crops. It can also provide manufacturers of whole wheat with natural antioxidants that can potentially be used to substitute their synthetic counterparts in wheat based products...|$|R
