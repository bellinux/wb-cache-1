Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> in high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets. Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.|$|E
5|$|At 03:45 on 26 May the North Vietnamese began a heavy {{bombardment}} with {{mortar and}} rockets, accompanied by machine-gun and small-arms fire. Immediately following the barrage, Balmoral {{was subjected to}} a ground assault across the open ground from the north-east by a force of up to battalion strength, falling primarily on D Company, commanded by Major Peter Phillips. At {{the same time the}} North Vietnamese conducted a feint on the southern perimeter opposite A Company—under Major Horrie Howard—using Bangalore torpedoes to break through the wire, although the gap was not exploited. Two Centurions that had been sited directly on the main axis of assault but concealed during the day, rolled forward under the cover of darkness. Their machine-guns and canister rounds proved telling during the fighting; the main attack stalled as it reached the wire before being repelled with heavy casualties by the combined firepower of the Australian infantry and tanks. Meanwhile, as sporadic mortar, rocket-propelled grenade and small-arms fire continued, to the south FSB Coral was also hit with suppressing fire from mortars, recoilless rifles and rocket-propelled grenades between 04:15 and 04:30, killing one Australian and wounded another. The defenders at Balmoral then directed fire from helicopter gunships and C-47 Spooky aircraft onto likely assembly areas and mortar <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> locations. Around 05:00 the North Vietnamese finally broke contact and withdrew, removing the majority of their casualties under covering fire as the Australian artillery fired on their escape routes. Clearing patrols from 3 RAR then swept the area at first light but found only six North Vietnamese dead and a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and equipment. The Australians subsequently began the evacuation of their casualties, having lost a further three dead and 14 wounded.|$|E

25|$|During {{the post-war}} period, Lionel {{produced}} a construction set, utilizing a unique component set. While competitive sets used {{nut and bolt}} fasteners, the Lionel set employed round-head aircraft rivets retained with rubber grommets, {{eliminating the need for}} tools. The structural elements were hollow beams of square cross section made from folded and quite thin sheet aluminum, as a consequence subject to destruction if stepped upon. A more substantial folded aluminum <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> was used to form the foundation of most constructions, and additional circular plates could be used to construct larger wheels or pivots. Pulleys, gussets, and splices were also included. The deluxe kits included an electric AC motor with a worm drive and reduction gearset that was powered from household power. While innovative, the lack of general purpose beam members with lots of holes limited the adaptability of the set to complex constructions. Finished assemblies also lacked the robust durability of its principal competition at the time, the Erector Set.|$|E

40|$|Steel column <b>base</b> <b>plates</b> are {{integral}} parts in steel structures. They {{are widely used}} in foundations of various types of structures such as building frames, bridges, transmission towers, light poles and road signs. They spread column forces over a larger contact area and transfer forces to anchor bolts and cementitious grout beneath them. However, gradual thinning of <b>base</b> <b>plates</b> due to corrosion damage reduces their load bearing capacity and subsequently jeopardises the structural integrity of the entire structure. This paper presents a remaining capacity assessment method for steel column bases derived analytically based on a time-dependent corrosion rate model and the yield-line theory. Time dependent moment capacity of <b>base</b> <b>plates</b> is derived analytically {{as a function of}} time and geometric parameters of the plate. Solution to a wide-flange-section-to-column-base plate connection subjected to major axis bending moment is presented. Results of the analytical expression are compared to a three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model and good agreement is obtained. The proposed model may contribute to the prediction of remaining strength and repair schedule of corroded steel column bases...|$|R

In this paper, 4 types of column-foundation sub-assemblages are analytically studied. The sub-assemblages selected here represent various column-foundation configurations and loadings possible in steel MRF buildings. These column-foundation sub-assemblages are subjected to monotonic lateral displacement under axial load. The nonlinear responses of these sub-assemblages provide valuable insights into their possible earthquake performance, which may be useful in developing seismic design criteria for column base connections...|$|R

25|$|In 1966, Serra {{made his}} first sculptures out of nontraditional {{materials}} such as fiberglass and rubber. Serra's earliest work was abstract and process-based made from molten lead hurled in large splashes {{against the wall of}} a studio or exhibition space. In 1967 and 1968 he compiled a list of infinitives that served as catalysts for subsequent work: “to hurl” suggested the hurling of molten lead into crevices between wall and floor; “to roll” led to the rolling of the material into dense, metal logs. He began in 1969 to be primarily concerned with the cutting, propping or stacking of lead sheets, rough timber, etc., to create structures, some very large, supported only by their own weight. His “Prop” pieces from the late 1960s are arranged so that weight and gravity balance lead rolls and sheets. Cutting Device: <b>Base</b> <b>Plate</b> Measure (1969) consists of an assemblage of heterogeneous materials (lead, wood, stone and steel) into which two parallel cuts have been made and the results strewn around in a chance configuration.

500|$|Although the Australian {{position}} {{was not the}} focus of the attack, it too soon came under attack from [...] mortars, killing an American sapper. With the <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> positioned between the Australians and the US 1st Brigade's headquarters there was initial confusion over the source of the rounds, and both Gloztbach and Preece accused the other of firing on their positions. However, after US aircraft arrived overhead to illuminate the battlefield the Australians were able to join the fighting, and they began firing at masses of Viet Cong who had become disorientated and were milling around on the battlefield. Earlier, a number of Australian ambushes had intercepted Viet Cong pathfinder groups and this had largely prevented the communists from conducting a final reconnaissance of their objectives. Unaware of the newly strengthened defences, they had assaulted into the combined firepower of two American field artillery batteries firing over open sights, as well as tanks supported by infantry. Using anti-personnel canister, flechette and splintex rounds, as well as prepositioned banks of Claymore mines, the Americans broke up several assaults with heavy casualties, while the Australians poured small arms fire into the flank of what was now turning into a costly and futile attack.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, ten {{kinds of}} {{chemical}} solvents {{were used to}} immerse the waste printed circuit boards (PCBs). Comparing the effects of chemical swelling solvents on the peeling strength between copper foils and <b>base</b> <b>plates</b> from PCBs, solvent D, solvent F, acetone and water were selected as the typical chemical swelling solvents. After chemical swelling treatment, the monomer liberation degree and scrapping time were further investigated to obtain particles with certain size distribution. The experimental results showed that scrapping after chemical swelling treatment could remarkably increase the monomer liberation degree of metals. The chemical swelling effects of the four solvents were in the sequence solvent D > solvent F > acetone > water. The longer time and higher temperature favored the decrease of peeling strength between copper foils and <b>base</b> <b>plates</b> from PCBs. The copper foils could fall off from the <b>base</b> <b>plates</b> spontaneously after immersing in solvent D at 150 degrees C for 3 h or at 140 degrees C for 5 h.
