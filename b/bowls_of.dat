For {{students in the}} Left Bank, there were restaurants like Flicoteau, on rue de la Parcheminerie, which had no tablecloths or napkins, where diners ate at long tables with benches, and the menu consisted of <b>bowls</b> <b>of</b> bouillon with pieces of meat.

25|$|One {{of the key}} {{features}} of this most successful Attic vase painting style is the mastery of perspective foreshortening, allowing a much more naturalistic depiction of figures and actions. Another characteristic is the drastic reduction of figures per vessel, of anatomic details, and of ornamental decorations. In contrast, the repertoire of depicted scenes was increased. For example, the myths surrounding Theseus became very popular at this time. New or modified vase shapes were frequently employed, including the Nolan amphora (see Typology of Greek Vase Shapes), lekythoi, as well as <b>bowls</b> <b>of</b> the askos and dinos types. The specialisation into separate vase and bowl painters increased.|$|E
25|$|The Archaic period, from 8000–2000 BCE, {{experienced}} warmer climates. Archaic {{peoples in}} West Virginia were hunter-gatherers, who fished and gathered wild berries, nuts, seeds, and wild plants. The megafauna had migrated or died out by this time, so people hunted deer, bear, wild turkeys, rabbits, {{and other small}} game with atlatls and small spears. The atlatls used elaborate stone weights called bannerstones. They used ground-stone implements and flint woodworking tools, as well as <b>bowls</b> <b>of</b> sandstone and soapstone, knives, and net sinkers. In Kanawha Valley, tools were made with Kanawha Black Flint. The Kessell Side Notched point at the St. Albans Site, dated to 7900 BCE, {{is an example of}} a rare, early archaic stone point.|$|E
25|$|The Super <b>Bowls</b> <b>of</b> {{the late}} 2000s and early 2010s are notable for the {{performances}} (and the pedigrees) {{of several of}} the participating quarterbacks, and stagnation (especially on the AFC side) in repeated appearances by the same teams and players.

In addition, Eli Manning (two appearances, two wins), Drew Brees (one appearance, one win), Aaron Rodgers (one appearance, one win), and Joe Flacco (one appearance, one win) have all added Super Bowl championships and Super Bowl MVP awards to their lists of individual accomplishments.|$|E

Each day, the squad leader receives their work assignment for that day, and the squad are then fed according to how they perform. Prisoners in each squad are thus forced to work together and pressure each other to get their task done. If any prisoner is slacking, the whole squad will be punished. Despite this, Solzhenitsyn shows that a surprising loyalty exists among the work gang members, with Shukhov teaming up with other prisoners to steal felt and extra <b>bowls</b> <b>of</b> porridge; even the squad leader defies the authorities by tar-papering over the empty windows at their work site. Indeed, only through such solidarity can the prisoners do anything more than survive from day to day.|$|E
25|$|During the 2nd {{half of the}} 4th century BC, mythological themes {{disappeared}} from the repertoire of Etruscan painters. They were replaced by female heads and scenes of up to two figures. Instead of figural depictions, ornaments and floral motifs covered the vessel bodies. Large figural compositions, like that on a krater by the Den Haag Funnel Group Painter were only produced exceptionally. The originally large-scale production at Falerii lost its dominant role to the production centre at Caere, which had probably been founded by Falerian painters and cannot be said to represent a distinct tradition. The standard repertoire of the Caere workshops included simply painted oinochoai, lekythoi and drinking <b>bowls</b> <b>of</b> the Torcop Group, and plates of the Genucuilia Group. The switch {{to the production of}} black glaze vases {{near the end of the}} 4th century, probably as a reaction to changing tastes of the time, spelt the end of Etrurian red-figure vase painting.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} ceramics in {{the lowest}} levels of occupation contained a distinct pottery style, most associated with early agriculturalists in southern Africa. Much of {{the first phase of}} occupation is dominated by locally produced ceramics, mentioned above, Islamic glazed ware, and Ziwa tradition ceramics. The two notable types of glaze ware includes tin-glazed with a splash painted decoration and a light blue glaze. Contained in the artefact assemblage were two fragments of light blue glaze on a buff body found {{in the lowest}} occupation in addition to small sherds of similar type. Another two imported ceramics were two <b>bowls</b> <b>of</b> different sizes, one 22cm in diameter and the other 28cm in diameter. These were of the same design of a slightly raised ridge found on the inside body and turned out lips, but of differing size. This bowls were characteristic of ceramics found in Period Ia in Kilwa Kisiwani located to the north in Tanzania. It remains unknown as to whether these were imported from Kilwa or produced locally. These ceramic types were only found in the lower levels of occupation.|$|E
