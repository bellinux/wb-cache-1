40|$|Modern {{handheld}} {{devices such}} as smart phones and tablets have become popular for capturing and viewing panoramic images, but navigation in these devices is a challenging task due to small screen size. In this thesis work, investigation is done for {{similarities and differences between}} two user interaction techniques of one-dimensional cubical panorama images. This work is carried out on a fourth generation Apple iPod Touch. The first user interaction technique swipe (drag-based panning) is developed using touch-gestures, while the second technique look-around (device-orientation panning) is developed using motion-sensors such as gyroscope and accelerometer for device-orientation. Both these techniques were implemented for touch-screen devices for an angle of 360 degrees.      In the swipe technique, the navigation is done by using finger movements on the screen, while in the look-around <b>based</b> <b>panning</b> technique the navigation is done by moving the device direction physically in space through an angle of 360 degrees. The experiments were conducted on 20 participants for the two panning techniques. The results have shown that the look-around <b>based</b> <b>panning</b> technique offers a better user interaction compared to swipe <b>based</b> <b>panning</b> technique. Look-around <b>based</b> <b>panning</b> technique is natural and more free to move physically in space. Swipe <b>based</b> <b>panning</b> technique is easy to use in some situations and it does not require any physical space to move around the system. ...|$|R

40|$|Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was {{produced}} by redox polymerization of acrylonitrile and then was modified with 50 % aqueous solutions of H 2 SO 4 or NaOH. Copolymers of acrylonitrile' with acrylic acid, acrylamide or methylenebisacrylamide were prepared by radical polymerization. The structures of these polymers <b>based</b> on <b>PAN</b> were studied by IR-spectroscopy {{in order to determine}} their characteristic groups. The cation exchange capacity is higher in polymers containing more acidic groups (COOH), and for the examined cases the adsorbability was Cu 2 + > Zn 2 + (ion exchange selectivity). The discoloring ability of the examined polymers was studied with aqueous solutions of three dyes, i. e. methylene blue (cationic or basic dye), congo red (direct dye having similarities with anionic dyes) and alizarin yellow (acid dye or anionic monoazo dye). The results are interpreted in terms of electron donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions between the main groups of the polymers and the dyes. The presence of -CONH 2 (having polar character) in the polymers <b>based</b> on <b>PAN,</b> produces favorable interactions with the groups (electron donor or acceptor) of the molecules of the three dyes. The design of new polymer materials <b>based</b> on <b>PAN</b> with increased adsorption ability, could be performed with such a discoloring investigation, especially for methylene blue and alizarin yellow...|$|R
40|$|The {{correspondence}} between theoretical concept and the experimental fracture behaviors of ceramic fibers such as Pitch <b>based</b> and <b>PAN</b> <b>based</b> carbon fibers, alumina and glass fibers were discussed using twisting {{test and the}} loop test. In twisting test under the combined stress, the theoretical value of tensile strength was approximately consistent with the measurement value of that in Pitch based carbon fibers. Thus correspondence was not confirmed in <b>PAN</b> <b>based</b> carbon fibers by the effect of structural anisotropic. In the loop test, the fracture surfaces of alumina, carbon and glass fibers in- dicated a typical pattern containing a line shape, which appeared on the compression side of alumina fibers and on the tension side of carbon and glass fibers. These fracture morphologies are interpreted as being locations of crack initiation (tension side in alumina and compression side in carbon) by bend-breaking.

40|$|Laminar {{composites}} were fabricated from pristine and bromine intercalated pitch based graphite fibers. It {{was found}} that laminar composites could be fabricated using either pristine or intercalated graphite fibers using standard fabrication techniques. The intercalated graphite fiber composites had electrical properties which were markedly improved over both the corresponding pitch <b>based</b> and polyacrylonitrile (<b>PAN)</b> <b>based</b> composites. Despite composites resistivities more than {{an order of magnitude}} lower for pitch based fiber composites, the lightning strike resistance was poorer than that of the <b>Pan</b> <b>based</b> fiber composites. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} mechanical properties of the pitch fibers are more important than electrical or thermal properties in determining the lightning strike resistance. Based on indicated lightning strike tolerance for high elongation to failure materials, the use of vapor grown, rather than pitch based graphite fibers appears promising...|$|R

The main purpose was to provide an {{implementable}} design scenario for underground coal mines using wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The main reason being that given the intricacies in the physical structure of a coal mine, only low power WSN nodes can produce accurate surveillance and accident detection data. The work mainly concentrated on designing and simulating various alternate scenarios for a typical mine and comparing them based on the obtained results to arrive at a final design. The simulations were done in Qulanet- 4. 5 simulator. The bytes send, received, throughput, MAC layer and physical layers were analyzed in the process for all the scenarios.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to compare two multi-speaker spatialization {{techniques}} - Vector <b>Base</b> <b>Panning</b> (VBP) and Ambisonics - on a particular loudspeaker layout. Theory is presented for configurations in the horizontal plane. A way to deal with the elevation effect for such layouts is proposed. A new "local" panning method is introduced. VBP and Ambisonics are compared on a 5. 1 configuration by means of objective simulation and preliminary listening tests on the real-time DSP system Genesis. This study could find recording and mixing applications in home cinema and multimedia. 1 Introduction In the past years, many spatialization systems have been designed. The aim of these systems is to reproduce at the listener's ears various indices that bring information about the position of reproduced sound sources. Among all sound spatialization systems, we will discuss systems using several loudspeakers in the horizontal plane and most particularly the 5. 1 format loudspeaker configurat [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) /Chitosan {{composite}} ultrafiltration membranes {{were prepared}} by filtration of Chitosan solution through <b>PAN</b> <b>base</b> membrane and subsequent curing and treatment with NaOH. The formation of Chitosan layer {{on the surface}} as well as pore walls of <b>PAN</b> <b>base</b> membrane was characterized by different techniques. Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflectance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy studies indicated the formation of Chitosan layer on the surface, whereas determination of pure water permeation, pore size distribution and molecular weight cut off indicated the reduction in pore size due to formation of Chitosan layer on the pore walls of <b>PAN</b> <b>base</b> membrane. It was further observed that these composite membranes had sharperer molecular weight cut off as well as narrower pore size distribution than the corresponding base membrane. The reduction in negative zeta potential of <b>PAN</b> <b>base</b> membrane at pH 9. 0 and observation of positive zeta potential at pH 5. 0 with composite membranes also confirmed the formation of Chitosan layer on the pore walls of base membrane. The composite membranes {{were found to be}} stable in aqueous medium and showed reduction in pure water fluxes measured after filtration of aqueous acidic (pH 3. 0) and basic (pH 11. 0) solution, which was attributed to the swelling of Chitosan layer.
