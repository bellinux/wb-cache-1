5|$|Together {{with the}} Diplodocidae and the Rebbachisauridae, the Dicraeosauridae is nested inside the Diplodocoidea. All {{members of the}} Diplodocoidea are {{characterized}} by their <b>box-shaped</b> snout and narrow teeth restricted to the foremost portion of the jaws. Both the Dicraeosauridae and the Diplodocidae are characterized by bifurcated neural spines of the cervical and dorsal vertebra. In the Dicraeosauridae, the bifurcated neural spines were strongly elongated, a trend reaching its extreme in Amargasaurus.|$|E
5|$|Razer {{made its}} debut in the fourth heat of series two of Robot Wars, which was viewed by almost six million people on BBC Two. It had been {{finished}} late {{the night before the}} recording. Radio interference caused Razer to be hard to control in the Gauntlet stage of the competition, but it successfully navigated the obstacle course and progressed to the Trial. This phase was a robotic football match, wherein Razer scored the first goal to reach the heat semi-final. Its opponent for this one-on-one battle was Inquisitor, a <b>box-shaped</b> robot equipped with a rotating flail. Whilst Razer made the stronger start, crumpling Inquisitor's flail support, the cush drives in its motors sheared after an impact on the arena floor. This rendered Razer immobile and ended a promising run.|$|E
5|$|The {{mail pouch}} was a {{separate}} component to the saddle {{that made the}} Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time consuming detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a mochila, or covering of leather, was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or <b>box-shaped</b> hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.|$|E
5|$|The subfamilies of Dromaeosauridae {{frequently}} {{shift in}} content based on new analysis, but typically consist {{of the following}} groups. A number of dromaeosaurids have not been assigned to any particular subfamily, often because they are too poorly preserved to be placed confidently in phylogenetic analysis (see section Phylogeny below), or because they are basal relative to the primary subdivisions of Dromaeosauridae (Mahakala, for example, is the most primitive known dromaeosaurid and falls outside any named sub-group). The most basal subfamily of dromaeosaurids is often {{found to be the}} Unenlagiinae. This enigmatic group is the most poorly supported subfamily of dromaeosaurids and it is possible that some or all of its members belong outside of Dromaeosauridae. The larger, ground-dwelling members like Buitreraptor and Unenlagia show strong flight adaptations, although they were probably too large to 'take off'. One member of this group, Rahonavis, is very small, with well-developed wings that show evidence of quill knobs (the attachment points for flight feathers) and it is very likely that it could fly. The next most primitive clade of dromaeosaurids is the Microraptoria. This group includes many of the smallest dromaeosaurids, which show adaptations for living in trees. All known dromaeosaurid skin impressions hail from this group and all show an extensive covering of feathers and well-developed wings. Like the unenlagiines, some species may have been capable of active flight. The subfamily Velociraptorinae has traditionally included Velociraptor, Deinonychus, and Saurornitholestes, and while the discovery of Tsaagan lent support to this grouping, the inclusion of Saurornitholestes is still uncertain. The Dromaeosaurinae is usually found to consist of medium to giant-sized species, with generally <b>box-shaped</b> skulls (the other subfamilies generally have narrower snouts).|$|E

25|$|Arellano was {{influenced}} by early Filipino art which uses local motifs and diverse imagery of Philippine flora. Aside from his knowledge on Filipino art was the factor of economy which both helped the architect in having a modern design approach to the theater. Meanwhile, the phrase “on wings of song” gave the structural configuration, a <b>box-shaped</b> auditorium flanked by pavilions on both sides. The mix of modernization and romanticization resulted in A. V. H. Hartendrop labeling it as modern expressionism.|$|E
25|$|Later on, the organistrum {{was made}} smaller {{to let a}} single player both turn the crank and work the keys. The solo organistrum was known from Spain and France, but was largely {{replaced}} by the symphonia, a small <b>box-shaped</b> version of the hurdy-gurdy with three strings and a diatonic keyboard. At about the same time, {{a new form of}} key pressed from beneath was developed. These keys were much more practical for faster music and easier to handle; eventually they completely replaced keys pulled up from above. Medieval depictions of the symphonia show both types of keys.|$|E
25|$|The breast {{reduction}} {{performed with}} the horizontal-scar technique features a horizontal incision along the inframammary fold (IMF) and a nipple-areola complex (NAC) pedicle. To elevate the NAC, the technique usually employs either an inferior pedicle or an inferior-lateral pedicle, and features no vertical incision (like the Anchor pattern). The horizontal-scar technique best applies to the woman whose oversized breasts are too large for a vertical-incision technique (e.g. the lollipop pattern); and it has two therapeutic advantages: no vertical incision-scar to the breast hemisphere, and better healing of the periareolar scar of the transposed NAC. The potential disadvantages are <b>box-shaped</b> breasts with thick (hypertrophied) incision scars, especially at the inframammary fold.|$|E
25|$|The long, <b>box-shaped</b> SIBMAS hull is of {{all-welded}} {{steel construction}} {{and provides the}} crew with protection from small arms fire and artillery fragments. Most SIBMAS variants possess a horizontal roofline, which slopes inwards at the rear. The engine compartment {{is located in the}} rear hull and to the left. Engine components are removed through the hull roof for servicing. Passengers may debark from a large door in the rear hull to the right. Entry doors and firing ports are also present in the sides of the vehicle, and there are three hull roof hatches for observation purposes. Drivers are seated {{at the front of the}} vehicle and provided with a single hatch cover and three large windows. The turret of the SIBMAS AFSV-90 is located near the hull front, immediately behind the driving compartment, and is provided with three large rectangular hatches.|$|E
25|$|At first, Merengue Típico Cibaeño (traditional Cibanian merengue) {{was played}} on {{stringed}} instruments like the tres and cuatro, but when Germans {{came to the}} island in the late 19th century trading their instruments for tobacco, the accordion quickly replaced the strings as lead instrument. Típico groups play a variety of rhythms, but most common are the merengue and the pambiche. In the 1930s–50s a bass instrument was also often used. Called marimba, it resembles the Cuban marímbula, and is a large <b>box-shaped</b> thumb piano with 3-6 metal keys. The main percussion instruments, güira and tambora, {{have been a part}} of the ensemble since the music's inception, and are so important that they are often considered symbolic of the whole country. The güira is a metal scraper believed to be of native Taíno origin, while the tambora is a two-headed drum of African origin. Together with the European accordion, the típico group symbolizes the three cultures that combined to make today's Dominican Republic.|$|E
25|$|During the {{development}} of this vehicle, the ABTU proposed to mount the large, high velocity 152mm cannon on the T-100 in order to give it the capacity to destroy bunkers and other strong fixed fortifications. The plant manager at N°185 proposed to stop {{the development}} of the prototype to use T-100 as a self-propelled gun armed with the 100 and 130mm naval guns. This idea was accepted and on January 8, 1940, the plans of the T-100-X were finalized and sent to the Izhorskyi factory. The T-100-X had a <b>box-shaped</b> fighting compartment and was equipped with the 130mm B-13 naval gun. For mobility, kept the torsion bar suspension system, as was the trend in modern tanks of the day. During {{the development of}} the prototype the shape of the fighting compartment was modified to reduce ammunition loading times. The new design was the SU-100Y (sometimes called T-100 there). The designs of the SU-100Y were sent to the Izhorskyi factory on February 24, 1940 and assembly began on the first of the month. The self-propelled gun was tested {{for the first time on}} March 14. As the Winter War was finished, the SU-100Y never saw combat.|$|E
500|$|Food was {{stacked in}} piles of boxes, and draped with {{camouflage}} nets to resemble trucks: a large <b>box-shaped</b> pile for the truck's body, and smaller piles for the truck's cab and engine. That meant that attractive materials including sugar and cigarettes were dispersed around the desert {{instead of being}} in readily-guarded camps. The most desirable items were therefore put in the [...] "trucks" [...] {{in the middle of}} the areas and hidden in the middle of each stack, and army command accepted the risk of theft.|$|E
500|$|Bertram {{consisted}} both {{in creating}} the appearance of army units where none existed, and in concealing armour, artillery and materiel. Dummy tanks and guns were made mainly of local materials including calico and palm-frond hurdles. Real tanks were disguised as trucks, using light [...] "Sunshield" [...] canopies. Field guns and their limbers were also disguised as trucks, their real wheels visible, under a simple <b>box-shaped</b> [...] "Cannibal" [...] canopy to give {{the shape of a}} truck. Petrol cans were stacked along the sides of existing revetted trenches, hidden in the shadows. Food was stacked in piles of boxes, and draped with camouflage nets, to resemble trucks.|$|E
500|$|To {{protect the}} {{unloading}} transports during the night, Crutchley divided the Allied warship forces into three groups. A [...] "southern" [...] group, {{consisting of the}} Australian cruisers HMAS Australia and , cruiser , and destroyers [...] and , patrolled between Lunga Point and Savo Island to block the entrance between Savo Island and Cape Esperance on Guadalcanal. A [...] "northern" [...] group, consisting of the cruisers , [...] and , and destroyers [...] and , conducted a <b>box-shaped</b> patrol between the Tulagi anchorage and Savo Island to defend the passage between Savo and Florida Islands. An [...] "eastern" [...] group consisting of the cruisers [...] and [...] and two U.S. destroyers guarded the eastern entrances to the sound between Florida and Guadalcanal Islands. Crutchley placed two radar-equipped U.S. destroyers {{to the west of}} Savo Island to provide early warning for any approaching Japanese ships. The destroyer [...] patrolled the northern passage and the destroyer [...] patrolled the southern passage, with a gap of 12–30 kilometres (8–20mi) between their uncoordinated patrol patterns. At this time, the Allies were unaware of all of the limitations of their primitive ship-borne radars, such as the effectiveness of the radar could be greatly degraded by the presence of nearby landmasses. [...] Chicagos Captain Bode ordered his ship's radar to be turned off in the mistaken belief it would reveal his position. [...] He allowed a single sweep every half hour with the fire control radar, but the timing of the last pre-engagement sweep was too early to detect the approaching Japanese cruisers. [...] Wary of the potential threat from Japanese submarines to the transport ships, Crutchley placed his remaining seven destroyers as close-in protection around the two transport anchorages.|$|E
2500|$|Accordions (from 19th century German Akkordeon, from Akkord—"musical chord, concord of sounds") are {{a family}} of <b>box-shaped</b> musical {{instruments}} of the bellows-driven free-reed aerophone type, colloquially {{referred to as a}} squeezebox. A person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist. [...] The concertina and bandoneón are related; the harmonium and American reed organ are in the same family.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Box-shaped</b> {{holes in}} some rocks {{were caused by}} sulfates forming large {{crystals}}, {{and then when the}} crystals later dissolved, holes, called vugs, were left behind. [...] The concentration of the element bromine in rocks was highly variable probably because it is very soluble. [...] Water may have concentrated it in places before it evaporated. [...] Another mechanism for concentrating highly soluble bromine compounds is frost deposition at night that would form very thin films of water that would concentrate bromine in certain spots.|$|E
2500|$|The {{destroyer}} {{also carries}} anti-ship missiles in two 4-cell launchers just {{forward of the}} hangar. It is not confirmed whether the missiles are [...] YJ-85 or YJ-62. Unlike the launchers for previous Chinese anti-ship missiles, the Type 052C launchers are cylindrical rather than <b>box-shaped.</b> Missiles are guided by a Russian MR331 Mineral-ME (NATO codename [...] "Band Stand") fire-control radar atop the bridge and a [...] "Light Bulb" [...] datalink forward of the hangar.

2500|$|The {{station was}} moved in 1975 {{to the newly}} {{constructed}} Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome [...] wide by [...] high, with [...] steel archways. One served as the entry to the dome {{and it had a}} transverse arch that contained modular buildings for the station's maintenance, fuel bladders, power plant, snow melter, equipment and vehicles. Individual buildings within the dome contained the dorms, galley, rec, post office and labs for monitoring the upper and lower atmosphere and numerous other complex projects in astronomy and astrophysics. The station also included the Skylab, a <b>box-shaped</b> tower slightly taller than the dome. Skylab was connected to the Dome by a tunnel. The Skylab housed atmospheric sensor equipment and later a music room.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s {{structural}} engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan, considered the [...] "father of tubular designs" [...] for high-rises, {{realized that the}} dominating rigid steel frame structure {{was not the only}} system apt for tall buildings, marking a new era of skyscraper construction in terms of multiple structural systems. His central innovation in skyscraper design and construction was the concept of the [...] "tube" [...] structural system, including the [...] "framed tube", [...] "trussed tube", and [...] "bundled tube". These systems allow greater economic efficiency, and also allow skyscrapers to take on various shapes, no longer needing to be rectangular and <b>box-shaped.</b> The first building to employ the tube structure was the Chestnut De-Witt apartment building. Over the next fifteen years, many towers were built by Fazlur Rahman Khan and the [...] "Second Chicago School", including the massive [...] Willis Tower. Other pioneers of this field include Hal Iyengar and William LeMessurier.|$|E
2500|$|The {{length of}} the {{resonators}} varies according to the frequency that the bar produces. Vibrations from the bars resonate as they pass through the tubes, which amplify the tone in a manner {{very similar to the}} way in which the body of a guitar or cello would. In instruments exceeding [...] octaves, the length of tubing required for the bass notes exceeds the height of the instrument. Some manufacturers, such as DeMorrow and Malletech, compensate for this by bending the ends of the tubes. This involves soldering smaller straight sections of tubes to form [...] "curved" [...] tubes. Both DeMorrow and Malletech use brass rather than aluminium. Others, such as Adams and Yamaha, expand the tubes into large <b>box-shaped</b> bottoms, resulting in the necessary amount of resonating space without having to extend the tubes. [...] This result is achieved by the custom manufacturer Marimba One by widening the resonators into an oval shape, with the lowest ones reaching nearly a foot in width, and doubling the tube up inside the lowest resonators.|$|E
2500|$|Fishermen use a <b>box-shaped</b> trap {{called a}} pot which {{consists}} of a steel frame covered with a nylon mesh. Each pot weighs [...] and a ship may carry 150 to 300 pots. Fish, usually herring or codfish, are placed inside as bait and then the pot is sunk to the sea floor where the king crab reside. The pots are dropped {{in a straight line}} (known as a [...] "string") for easier retrieval. Red and blue king crabs can be found anywhere between the intertidal zone and a depth of [...] Golden king crabs live in depths between 100 and 400fathoms (180–720m, 600–2400ft). The location of the pot is marked on the surface by a buoy which is later used for retrieval. After allowing the pots to rest on the sea floor (typically one to two days for red and blue king crabs, longer for golden king crabs), the pots are dragged back to the surface using a hydraulic winch with a pulley on the end called a [...] "block." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pannier tanks, in Britain used almost {{exclusively}} by the Great Western Railway, and also common in Belgium, are <b>box-shaped</b> tanks {{carried on the}} sides of the boiler like a pannier is carried by pack animal. Unlike the side tank, they do not go all the way down and there is space between the tank and the running plate. The pannier arrangement lowers the centre of gravity compared to a saddle tank, whilst still allowing easy access to the inside motion that the latter gave. [...] The first Great Western pannier tanks were actually converted from saddle tank locomotives when these were being rebuilt in the early 1900s with the Belpaire firebox. There were difficulties in accommodating the flat top of the latter within an encircling saddle tank which cut down capacity and increased the tendency to overheat the water in the tank. In Belgium, pannier tanks were in use at least since 1866, once again in conjunction with Belpaire firebox locomotives built for the Belgian State and for la Société Générale d'Exploitatation (SGE), a private company grouping smaller secondary lines. Pannier tank locomotives are often seen as iconic of the GWR.|$|E
2500|$|Development of the V10 series Camry and Vista {{began in}} August 1977 {{following}} the 1973 oil crisis and would later cover the 1979 crisis. Automobile manufacturers {{were making the}} inexorable move to downsized, lighter, more fuel efficient cars with better aerodynamic performance. The industry also began wide-scale switching from the rear-wheel-drive layout to the lighter and more compact front-wheel-drive {{in the interest of}} increased fuel economy. With a development focus on exports, particularly to the US, Toyota designed Camry to replace the Corona T130 in many overseas markets. It needed to compete with the compact, front-drive Honda Accord sedan from Japan. Via one-upmanship, Camry exceeded the Accord's wheelbase by [...] and offered larger engines. The design brief also established the compact front-wheel-drive X platform vehicles by General Motors in the US as competitors. In light of this competition—and a first for Toyota—the V10 adopted front-wheel drive with the engine transversely mounted. Between this layout that reduced the size of the engine compartment, the notchback sedan and liftback bodies with rear quarter windows, and the longer wheelbase of —the V10 series was considered spacious for its time and class. Furthermore, by situating the fuel tank underneath the back seat, luggage space is increased. The styling of the V10 followed the <b>box-shaped</b> trends characteristic of the early 1980s. Wind tunnel testing led to the fitment of drag-reducing flush pillars, a flat roofline to reduce wind buffeting, and one-piece front bumper with air dam to direct air flow. Drag coefficient is quoted at [...] for the sedan and [...] for the liftback.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} towers for the 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge featured four deep, <b>box-shaped</b> struts (two {{below the}} roadway and two above), {{as well as}} being tapered from being [...] wide at the base to [...] at the top. The new towers of the replacement span were to be the same width both at the bottom and the top, and were to feature a deep X-bracing system with three -deep single X-brace struts below the road deck and a series of three double-X brace struts of varying depths above the roadway (top being , middle being , and the bottom being [...] ). Tower construction began January 1, 1949, and progressed rapidly. Work went ahead of schedule and by April 1949, the [...] steel cable saddles were prepared for lifting. On April 13, 1949, the north cable saddle on the east tower was bolted into place on a set of shims to allow workers to rivet the top plate into place. Then, disaster struck. That morning, an earthquake measuring 7.1 rattled the Puget Sound region. The earthquake caused the towers to sway [...] from vertical, causing the cable saddle to shear its bolts and fall off the tower [...] The saddle fell [...] below. It missed the pedestal, and plunged straight through a barge, to a final resting spot [...] {{below the surface of the}} Narrows, [...] away from the pedestal. The resulting impact sank the barge, taking a compressor and numerous other tools with it. Divers soon located the cable saddle in a deep hole during a slack tide (the only time divers could operate, and slack tides only occurred at night). After a three-day delay, it was raised to the surface, repaired (the impact bent a corner on it), and reinstalled. The earthquake delayed completion of both the east and west towers on the bridge. After the earthquake's aftershocks subsided, work resumed, and by July 17 both towers were announced as being completed.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, {{next morning}} after breakfast we set out, without imparting our plans to any one, {{and with great}} labour dragged the trough to the water.

The two padded bed-like seats, each with blankets and mattress, he perceived, were boxes, and within he found Mr. Butteridge's conception of an adequate equipment for a balloon ascent: a hamper which included a game pie, a Roman pie, a cold fowl, tomatoes, lettuce, ham sandwiches, shrimp sandwiches, a large cake, knives and forks and paper plates, self-heating tins of coffee and cocoa, bread, butter, and marmalade, several carefully packed bottles of champagne, bottles of Perrier water, and a big jar of water for washing, a portfolio, maps, and a compass, a rucksack containing a number of conveniences, including curling-tongs and hair-pins, a cap with ear-flaps, and so forth.|$|E
60|$|But {{let us look}} at {{the true}} cottages. There are, I imagine, few places in England where the humble homes of the people have so great a charm. Undoubtedly they are darker inside, and not so {{convenient}} to live in as the modern <b>box-shaped,</b> red-brick, slate-roofed cottages, which have spread a wave of ugliness over the country; but they do not offend--they please the eye. They are smaller than the modern-built habitations; they are weathered and coloured by sun and wind and rain and many lowly vegetable forms to a harmony with nature. They appear related to the trees amid which they stand, to the river and meadows, to the sloping downs at the side, and to the sky and clouds over all. And, most delightful feature, they stand among, and are wrapped in, flowers as in a garment--rose and vine and creeper and clematis. They are mostly thatched, but some have tiled roofs, their deep, dark red clouded and stained with lichen and moss; and these roofs, too, have their flowers in summer. They are grown over with yellow stonecrop, that bright cheerful flower that smiles down at you from the lowly roof above the door, with such an inviting expression, so delighted to see you no matter how poor and worthless a person you may be or what mischief you may have been at, that you begin to understand the significance of a strange vernacular name of this plant--Welcome-home-husband-though-never-so-drunk.|$|E
6000|$|Bert, craning {{his neck}} through the cabin port-hole, saw {{the whole of}} that incident, that first {{encounter}} of aeroplane and ironclad. He saw the queer German drachenflieger, with their wide flat wings and square <b>box-shaped</b> heads, their wheeled bodies, and their single-man riders, soar down {{the air like a}} flight of birds. [...] "Gaw!" [...] he said. One to the right pitched extravagantly, shot steeply up into the air, burst with a loud report, and flamed down into the sea; another plunged nose forward into the water and seemed to fly to pieces as it hit the waves. He saw little men {{on the deck of the}} Theodore Roosevelt below, men foreshortened in plan into mere heads and feet, running out preparing to shoot at the others. Then the foremost flying-machine was rushing between Bert and the American's deck, and then bang! came the thunder of its bomb flung neatly at the forward barbette, and a thin little crackling of rifle shots in reply. Whack, whack, whack, went the quick-firing guns of the Americans' battery, and smash came an answering shell from the Furst Bismarck. Then a second and third flying-machine passed between Bert and the American ironclad, dropping bombs also, and a fourth, its rider hit by a bullet, reeled down and dashed itself to pieces and exploded between the shot-torn funnels, blowing them apart. Bert had a momentary glimpse of a little black creature jumping from the crumpling frame of the flying-machine, hitting the funnel, and falling limply, to be instantly caught and driven to nothingness by the blaze and rush of the explosion.|$|E
