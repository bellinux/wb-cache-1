5|$|Southern's {{emergency}} call {{is transferred from}} his superior, Sir William Frazer, to International Rescue. Landing outside the Plutonium Store in Thunderbirds 1 and 2, Scott and Virgil use the Laser Cutter Vehicle to <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> the doors. Inside the vault, Virgil releases Southern from the robot. As the time nears 30 minutes past noon, Scott, in possession of the three bracelets, takes off in Thunderbird 1; he jettisons them over the sea, where they explode harmlessly. On Jeff's orders, Lady Penelope and Parker intercept the Erdman Gang at their rendezvous and use FAB 1's cannon to shoot down the leader, Dempsey and Kenyon before they can escape in a helijet. Southern recovers from his ordeal at the Creighton-Ward Mansion.|$|E
5|$|The badnjak {{should not}} be jumped over or trodden upon, and blowing on its fire is avoided. It {{should not be}} moved when about to <b>burn</b> <b>through,</b> lest the log break at the place most {{consumed}} by the fire, which is usually strongest {{at the center of}} the fireplace; the separation of the log should be a result of the fire only. None of the family members should fall asleep before the log splits, otherwise some of them may die in the coming year, without warning.|$|E
25|$|In {{inertial}} confinement reactors, lasers are fired at a pellet of fuel (often {{made from a}} combination of deuterium and tritium) with the goal of compressing, heating, and igniting the fusion fuel and creating a propagating <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> the compressed fuel plasma so as to burn approximately 30 percent before the compressed fuel, now in a very high temperature plasma state, itself disassembles.|$|E

Because they are so massive, O-type stars have very hot cores and <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> their hydrogen fuel very quickly, so they are the first stars to leave the main sequence.|$|E
25|$|While {{the fast}} ends at nightfall of 9-10 Av, the {{restrictions}} of the Three Weeks and Nine Days continue through noon on 10 Av because the Second Temple continued to <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> {{most of that}} day. When 9 Av falls on Shabbat, when fasting is prohibited, the fast is postponed until 10 Av. In that case, the restrictions of the Three Weeks and Nine Days end with the fast, except for the prohibition against eating meat and drinking wine, which extend until the morning of 10 Av.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{vacuum tubes}} {{are much less}} {{susceptible}} than corresponding solid-state components to transient overvoltages, such as mains voltage surges or lightning, the electromagnetic pulse effect of nuclear explosions or geomagnetic storms produced by giant solar flares. This property kept them in use for certain military applications long after more practical and less expensive solid-state technology was available for the same applications, as for example with the MiG-25. In that plane, output power of the radar is about one kilowatt and it can <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> a channel under interference.|$|E

25|$|The ABL did not <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> or {{disintegrate}} its target. It heated {{the missile}} skin, weakening it, causing failure from high speed flight stress. The laser used chemical fuel similar to rocket propellant {{to generate the}} high laser power. Plans called for each 747 to carry enough laser fuel for about 20 shots, or {{perhaps as many as}} 40 low-power shots against fragile TBMs. To refuel the laser, YAL-1 would have to land. The aircraft itself could have been refueled in flight, which would have enabled it to stay aloft for long periods. Preliminary operational plans called for the ABL to be escorted by fighters and possibly electronic warfare aircraft. The ABL aircraft would likely have had to orbit near potential launch sites (located in hostile countries) for long periods, flying a figure-eight pattern that allows the aircraft to keep the laser aimed toward the missiles.|$|E
25|$|According to Frank Hamilton Cushing, Native American cooking baskets {{used by the}} Zuni (Zuñi) {{developed}} from mesh casings woven to stabilize gourd water vessels. He reported witnessing cooking basket use by Havasupai in 1881. Roasting baskets covered with clay would be filled with wood coals and the product to be roasted. When the thus fired clay separated from the basket, it would become a usable clay roasting pan in itself. This indicates a steady progression from use of woven gourd casings to waterproof cooking baskets to pottery. Other than in many other cultures, Native Americans used and still use the heat source inside the cookware. Cooking baskets are filled with hot stones and roasting pans with wood coals. Native Americans would form a basket from large leaves to boil water, according to historian and novelist Louis L'Amour. As long as the flames did not reach above the level {{of water in the}} basket, the leaves would not <b>burn</b> <b>through.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Hurricane was {{a steady}} gun platform, and had {{demonstrated}} its ruggedness as several were badly damaged yet returned to base. But the Hurricane's construction made it dangerous if it caught fire; the wood frames and fabric covering {{of the rear}} fuselage allowed fire to spread through the rear fuselage structure easily. In addition, the gravity fuel tank in the forward fuselage sat {{right in front of}} the instrument panel, without any form of protection for the pilot. Many Hurricane pilots were seriously burned as a consequence of a jet of flame which could <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> the instrument panel. This became of such concern to Hugh Dowding that he had Hawker retrofit the fuselage tanks of the Hurricanes with a self-expanding rubber coating called Linatex. If the tank happened to be punctured by a bullet, the linatex coating would expand when soaked with petrol and seal it. Some Hurricane pilots also felt that the fuel tanks in the wings, although they were protected with a layer of Linatex, were vulnerable from behind, and it was thought that these, not the fuselage tank, were the main fire risk.|$|E

25|$|Ore {{was brought}} to the surface up a winding shaft outside the coe. The miners' {{equipment}} included picks, hammers and wedges to split the rock, wiskets or baskets to contain it, corves or sledges to drag it to the shaft bottom, and windlasses or stows, to lift it to the surface. In later years underground transport was improved by replacing corves by wagons, often running on wooden or metal rails. A good example of an 18th-century wooden railway {{can be found in the}} Merry Tom mine, near Via Gellia. The miners avoided the need to excavate hard rock whenever they could and where it was unavoidable sometimes resorted to fire-setting. A fire was built against the rock face after mining had finished for the day and allowed to <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> the night. Fragmentation of the heated rock was increased by throwing water on to it. The rule about fire-setting only after the end of the day's work was important because in the confined mines the smoke was deadly. Fire-setting was a skilled technique and was used sparingly for that reason as well as because of the disruption caused by the smoke and the danger from splintering rock.|$|E
25|$|Giger's {{original}} {{design for the}} facehugger was a much larger creature with eyes and a spring-loaded tail. Later, in response to comments from the filmmakers, Giger reduced the creature's size substantially. At first, Giger assumed that the facehugger would wrap around {{the outside of the}} astronaut's helmet, but Scott decided that it would have far more impact if the facehugger were revealed once the helmet was removed. Scott and Giger realised that the facehugger should <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> the helmet's faceplate with its acid blood; subsequent redesigns of the space helmet included a far larger faceplate to allow for this. Dan O'Bannon initially conceived the facehugger as somewhat resembling an octopus, possessing tentacles. However, when he received H. R. Giger's designs, which substituted tentacles with fingerlike digits, he found Giger's design concept to be superior. Since no one was available at the time, O'Bannon decided to design the facehugger prop himself. The technical elements of the musculature and bone were added by Ron Cobb. Giger's initial design for the smaller facehugger had the fingers facing forward, but O'Bannon's redesign shifted the legs to the side. When the foam rubber sculpture of the facehugger was produced, O'Bannon asked that it should remain unpainted, believing the rubber, which resembled human skin, was more plausible.|$|E
500|$|While {{the fire}} bore marked {{similarities}} to the 1957 fire, {{the level of}} contamination was less severe because the HEPA filters in the exhaust system did not <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> (After the 1957 fire, the filter material was changed from cellulose to nonflammable fiberglass). Had the filters failed or the roof (which sustained heavy fire damage) been breached, the release {{could have been more}} severe than the 1957 fire. About [...] of plutonium was in the storage area where the fire occurred, and about [...] total plutonium was in building 776/777.|$|E
50|$|The {{flight was}} also memorable for its {{dramatic}} re-entry. The craft's service module did not separate, so it entered the atmosphere nose-first, leaving cosmonaut Boris Volynov hanging by his restraining straps. As the craft aerobraked, the atmosphere <b>burned</b> <b>through</b> the module. But the craft righted itself before the escape hatch was <b>burned</b> <b>through.</b> Then, the parachute lines tangled and the landing rockets failed, {{resulting in a}} hard landing which broke Volynov's teeth.|$|R

500|$|In the episode's climactic {{fight between}} Reyes and James in a {{fireworks}} factory, a moment sees James <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> a brick wall, {{and the two}} falling [...] into the factory below. The sequence was choreographed with two stunt doubles descending through a fake wall on wires, but {{on the day the}} filming schedule was changed and there was no longer time to set up the wire rig. Instead, the stunt team had the doubles fall through the wall without wires, and land on pads below, which stunt coordinator Tanner Gill said ultimately [...] "worked really effectively". For the subsequent fireworks factory explosion, a practical explosion was created by the series effects team, and then CG fireworks were added by Pixomondo. The practical explosion shook all the stages around the ABC Studios lot.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "facehugger" [...] and its proboscis, {{which was}} made of a sheep's intestine, were {{shot out of the}} egg using {{high-pressure}} air hoses. The shot was reversed and slowed down in editing to prolong the effect and reveal more detail. The facehugger itself was the first creature that H.R. Giger designed for the film, going through several versions in different sizes before deciding on a small creature with humanlike fingers and a long tail. Dan O'Bannon, with help from Ron Cobb, drew his own version based on Giger's design, which became the final version. Cobb {{came up with the idea}} that the creature could have a powerful acid for blood, a characteristic that would carry over to the adult Alien and would make it impossible for the crew to kill it by conventional means such as guns or explosives, since the acid would <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> the ship's hull. For the scene in which the dead facehugger is examined, Scott used pieces of fish and shellfish to create its viscera.|$|E
500|$|The Betty crew soon {{encounters}} Ripley 8. Call recognizes {{her name}} and tries to kill her, suspecting she {{may be used to}} create xenomorphs, but is unaware the creatures have already been cloned. The xenomorphs, having matured, escape confinement by killing off one of their own to use their acidic blood to <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> their enclosures, aware of their blood's acidity from said genetic memory. They then capture Dr. Jonathan Gediman and kill a second scientist. They damage the Auriga and kill some of those people who do not evacuate, including General Perez and Elgyn. Another crew member is cocooned for eggmorphing. Military scientist Dr. Wren reveals that the ship's default command in an emergency is to return to Earth. Realizing this will unleash the xenomorphs on Earth, Ripley 8, the mercenaries, Wren, a Marine named DiStephano and a surviving xenomorph host, Purvis, decide to head for the Betty and use it to destroy the Auriga. Along the way, Ripley 8 discovers a laboratory which contains the grotesque results of the previous seven failed attempts to clone Ellen Ripley. The surviving one begs Ripley 8 to euthanise her; she complies and then incinerates the lab and its contents.|$|E

500|$|... is {{the highest}} level of Fire Style jutsu {{exclusive}} to Itachi and Sasuke's Mangekyō Sharingan, said to be the [...] It is the antipode of Tsukuyomi. Amaterasu produces black flames at {{the focal point of the}} user's vision. Once created, it can continue burning for seven days and seven nights. The flames cannot be extinguished with water or any other normal method; only the user can put the flames out. Said to be [...] "the fires from hell" [...] and to burn as hot as the sun itself, Amaterasu burns virtually any material, including other flames, until nothing but ash remains. However, the flames cannot <b>burn</b> <b>through</b> chakra or materials infused with chakra, as they fail to burn into Naruto's Kurama chakra cloak or through Gaara's chakra-infused sand. This technique can also be sealed within the Sharingan of another person. Beyond mere offence, Amaterasu's flames can be used as a deterrent, with users surrounding themselves in its flames to discourage physical attacks. For more advanced users, they can shape Amaterasu into more specialized configurations. Use of Amaterasu puts a great deal of strain on the user, usually causing their eyes to bleed. For all its lethal potential, Amaterasu burns fairly slowly, allowing targets to remove burning clothes before their body is caught ablaze or, if it is too late for that, remove the burning body parts before it spreads. Other defensive options are pushing the flames away, absorbing them, certain space–time ninjutsu, or being the host of the Ten Tails.|$|E
