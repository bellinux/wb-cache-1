50|$|Type 63 has {{a typical}} tank layout: {{steering}} compartment at the front, fighting compartment {{in the center}} and the engine compartment in the back. Although it is externally similar to PT-76 it has some essential differences from its Soviet equivalent. Instead of a three-man crew on the PT-76, the Type 63 has a four-man crew for better efficiency. Unlike in the PT-76 where the driver's station is located {{in the center of the}} front of the hull, the type 63 has the driver's station located on the left hand side of the front of the hull. The driver has a round hatch with three periscope vision blocks over his station. Gunner and commander have their stations in the left hand side of the turret and the loader has his in the right hand side of the turret. The turret has two hatches. The right turret hatch opens backwards and has a mount for 12.7 mm Type 54 anti-aircraft heavy machine gun. The left turret hatch opens forwards, has a periscope vision block and can be fitted with the 7.62 mm Type 59T anti-aircraft medium machine gun. There's a dome-shaped ventilator behind the hatches. The tank is wider and higher than PT-76. The Type 63 has a flat, boat-like hull similar to the design of the PT-76, apart from a nearly horizontal glacis plate, higher gradient of the bottom of the bow, different engine grills with three separate vertical slot side air inlets on the Type 63, in contrast to the single large inlet with inset vertical <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> on the PT-76. There's also a slight bulge in the center of each side of the hull (hull sides in PT-76 are smooth). Also the tracks are mounted higher and the roadwheels are bigger. The half-egg-shape, cast turret, which is sometimes considered to be a modified Type 62 turret, is actually a modified Type 60 turret. It is placed in the center of the vehicle (unlike in PT-76 which has the turret closer to the front of the vehicle) and has a ventilator dome with a snorkel fitting. Apart from his usual duty of reloading the gun after it has been fired by the gunner, the loader is also responsible for operating the 12.7 mm Type 54 anti-aircraft heavy machine gun mounted on the turret's roof.|$|E
40|$|A shallow solar-pond {{integrated}} with a <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> is investigated theoretically and experimentally under Tanta prevailing weather conditions. A transient mathematical model is presented for the pond. The energy-balance equations for {{various parts of}} the pond are solved analytically using the elimination technique. In order to validate the theoretical model, experiments are performed under the batch mode of heat extraction with a black painted <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> made of stainless steel, with and without vents in the plate, for different masses of water in the upper and lower layers. It is found that the pond-water temperature decreases with increasing vent area; therefore, the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> should be used without vents with shallow depths of the upper water-layer. Experiments have also been carried out using baffle plates made from Al and mica in order to study the effect of the thermal conductivity of the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> on the pond's performance. The average temperature of the pond water is found to be less dependent on the thermal conductivity of the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate.</b> It is also inferred that the present system could provide 88 L of hot water at a maximum temperature of 71 Â°C at 3 : 00 pm with a daily efficiency of 64. 3 % when the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> is used without vents. The pond can retain hot water until 7 : 00 am of the next day at a temperature of 43 Â°C, which can be used for most domestic applications.

40|$|In the {{analysis}} of an acoustic radiation mode of a <b>baffled</b> <b>plate,</b> Rayleigh integral with free space Green’s function is involved. The boundary element method (BEM) {{is one of the}} approaches to compute its modes and radiation efficiencies. In this paper a fast multipole BEM in conjunction with an iterative solver based on the implicit restart Arnold method is proposed to efficiently and accurately evaluate acoustic radiation modes and efficiencies. Even though a 3 D free space Green’s function is used here, a quad tree is used for the hierarchical tree structure of the boundary mesh instead of an oct tree, which can speed up the fast multipole BEM. Similar to the analytical integration of moment evaluations, the analytical integration is also employed to compute the local expansion coefficients which further improves the efficiency of the fast multipole BEM for {{the analysis}} of an acoustic radiation mode of <b>baffled</b> <b>plates.</b> Comparison between numerical and theoretical radiation efficiencies of a <b>baffled</b> circular <b>plate</b> vibrating as a piston shows that the fast multipole BEM proposed here can give results with very good accuracy.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{triangular}} {{design of a}} solar water heater not only enhances the overall gain to the system but also improves the natural convection between the absorbing plate and the water, leading to better performance of the system. A night insulation cover is used at the top surface of the heater to reduce the losses from the system during the off-sunshine hours. Another {{way to reduce the}} losses from the system is by using an insulating <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> in the tank. This plate divides the tank water into two portions, the water above this plate is known as the upper column and below is known as the lower column. The water of the two columns is in contact with each other {{with the help of the}} incoming and outgoing vents provided in the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate.</b> This plate also suppresses losses from the lower column during the off-sunshine hours. In this paper, we have studied the effect of a <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> on the performance ofa triangular built-in-storage solar water heater. To obtain the thermal behavior of the system, the energy balance quations are written at the different nodes, and the well-known finite difference forward time step marching technique is used for their solution. The proposed system is studied by varying the vent area, the water mass in the two columns and under a constant flow rate for different durations. The effects of the thermal conductivity and thickness of the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> on the water temperature are also investigated.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{of a high}} temperature shell and tube heat exchanger and chemical decomposer (thereafter — heat exchanger) with straight tube configuration have been performed using Fluent 6. 2. 16 code to examine flow distribution on the tube side. The heat exchanger can {{be a part of}} sulfur iodine thermochemical water splitting cycle {{which is one of the}} most studied cycles for hydrogen production. Uniformity of the flow distribution in the heat exchanger is very critical because the flow maldistribution among the tube or shell sides can result in decreasing of chemical decomposition and increasing of pumping power. In the current study the flow rate uniformity in the heat exchanger tubes has been investigated. Simulations of the straight tube configuration, tube configuration with <b>baffle</b> <b>plate</b> arrangement and with pebble bed region inside the tubes were performed to examine flow distribution on the tube side.

With the introduction of the <b>baffle</b> <b>plate,</b> there was a noticeable decrease in the flow maldistribution in the tubes.
