500|$|Headlam {{completed}} a flying instructors course in July 1936 {{and joined the}} staff of No.1 FTS. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1March 1937. Commencing in July 1938, {{he was one of}} six students {{to take part in the}} RAAF's first Long Specialist Navigation Course, run by Flight Lieutenants Bill Garing and Alister Murdoch at Point Cook. The course involved several epic training flights that attracted considerable media attention, including a twelve-day, [...] round-Australia trip by three Avro Ansons, one of which was piloted by Headlam, in November. The following month, Headlam led the three Ansons on a six-day journey <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> Central Australia. He subsequently passed the navigation course with a special distinction. On 27January 1939 he was posted to RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, as a flight commander. He served initially with No.2 Squadron, before transferring to No.1 Squadron on 29August. Both units operated Ansons.|$|E
500|$|To {{show the}} side effects Focusyn had on Bart, the animators made slight changes to his face as the episode progressed. It is first seen in the scene where Bart is reading [...] "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Pre-teens": a cheek line is added just under his eyes {{to suggest that he}} is {{starting}} to change. In another scene, Bart can be seen speed reading and later on, the animators drew him with [...] "mini-pupils". The staff discussed whether Bart's pupils would be bigger or smaller than normal while he is on the drug. The writers settled on smaller pupils and, according to Kirkland, [...] "several model sheets were going <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> the fax machines" [...] until the staff were satisfied with the size of Bart's pupils while influenced by the drug. In fact, psychostimulants used to treat ADHD are more likely cause pupils to become bigger (dilated).|$|E
500|$|Edgeworth devoted {{considerable}} {{effort to}} insisting that mathematical proofs were appropriate for all {{schools of thought}} in economics.

[...] The articles focused on a <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> tax incidence and responses by producers. [...] Edgeworth noticed that a monopoly producing a good that had jointness of supply but not jointness of demand (such as first class and economy on an airplane, if the plane flies, both sets of seats fly with it) might actually lower the price seen by the consumer for one of the two commodities if a tax were applied. [...] Common sense and more traditional, numerical analysis seemed to indicate that this was preposterous. [...] Seligman insisted that the results Edgeworth achieved were a quirk of his mathematical formulation. [...] He suggested that the assumption of a continuous demand function and an infinitesimal change in the tax resulted in the paradoxical predictions. [...] Harold Hotelling later showed that Edgeworth was correct and that the same result (a [...] "diminution of price {{as a result of the}} tax") could occur with a discontinuous demand function and large changes in the tax rate.|$|E

2500|$|Bread making {{began with}} the milling of the grain. It was a {{difficult}} and time-consuming task, performed by women. Each household stored its own grain, and {{it is estimated that}} it required at least three hours of daily effort to produce enough flour to make sufficient bread for a family of five. The earliest milling was performed with a pestle and mortar, or a stone quern consisting of a large lower stone that held the grain and a smooth upper stone that was moved <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> the grains (...) [...] This often left small pieces of grit in the flour. The use of the millstone became more widespread during the Iron Age, resulting in greater speed and increased production of flour.

50|$|In {{order for}} the fiber to be made into cloth or clothing, it must be spun (or twisted) into a strand known as yarn. When the yarn is ready and dyed for use {{it can be made}} into cloth in a number of ways. Knitting and crochet are common methods of {{twisting}} and shaping the yarn into garments or fabric. The most common use of yarn to make cloth is weaving. In weaving, the yarn is wrapped on a frame called a loom and pulled taut vertically. This is known as the warp. Then another strand of yarn is worked <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> wrapping <b>over</b> <b>and</b> under the warp. This wrapped yarn is called the weft. Most art and commercial textiles are made by this process.|$|R

2500|$|Throughout the afternoon, Confederate {{engineers}} {{scrambled to}} create a new defensive line 500 yards further south {{at the base of the}} Mule Shoe, while fighting at the Bloody Angle continued day and night with neither side achieving an advantage, until around 12:00 AM on May 13, the fighting finally stopped. At 4 A.M., the exhausted Confederate infantrymen were notified that the new line was ready and they withdrew from the original earthworks unit by unit. The combat they had endured for almost 24 hours was characterized by an intensity of firepower never previously seen in Civil War battles, as the entire landscape was flattened, all the foliage destroyed. An example of this can be found in the Smithsonian Museum of American History: a 22-inch stump of an oak tree at the Bloody Angle that was completely severed by rifle fire. There was a frenzy to the carnage on both sides. Fighting <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>over</b> the same corpse-strewn trenches for hours on end, using single shot muskets, the contending troops were periodically reduced to hand-to-hand combat reminiscent of battles fought during ancient times. Bodies piled up four and five high, and soldiers were forced to pause from time to time and throw corpses over the parapet since they formed an obstacle in the way of the fighting. Dead and wounded men were shot so many times that many of them simply fell apart into unrecognizable heaps of flesh. Surviving participants attempted to describe in letters, diaries, and memoirs the hellish intensity of that day, many noting that it was beyond words. Or, as one put it: [...] "Nothing can describe the confusion, the savage, blood-curdling yells, the murderous faces, the awful curses, and the grisly horror of the melee." [...] Some men claimed to have fired as many as 400 rounds that day. May 12 was the most intensive day of fighting during the battle, with Union casualties of about 9,000, Confederate 8,000; the Confederate loss includes about 3,000 prisoners captured in the Mule Shoe.|$|E

We had once supplied them during a visit with a pipe and tobacco; and when they had smoked and were about to leave, they found themselves confronted with a problem: should they take or leave what remained of the tobacco? The piece of plug was taken up, it was laid down again, it was handed <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>and</b> argued <b>over,</b> till the wife began to look haggard and the husband elderly.

Nei Takauti had taken some, she had no mind for more, plainly conceived it would be a breach of manners to set down the cup unfinished, and ordered her wedded retainer to dispose of what was left.

50|$|Kiss-and-run {{differs from}} full fusion, where the vesicle collapses fully into the plasma {{membrane}} and is then later retrieved by a clathrin-coat-dependent process. The idea of kiss-and-run fusion {{was first introduced}} by Bernard Katz and Jose del Castillo in 1955, who together hypothesized that synaptic vesicles fuse transiently with the plasma membrane. The actual term, kiss-and-run, originated from Bruno Ceccarelli in 1973, when he saw similar results to Katz and del Castillo using an electron microscope examining a frog neuromuscular junction. Today, there is <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> debate <b>over</b> full fusion and kiss-and-run fusion and which model portrays a more accurate picture of the mechanisms behind synaptic release. The increased accumulation of partially empty secretory vesicles following secretion, observed in electron micrographs are the most compelling evidence {{in favor of the}} kiss-and-run model. Accumulation of partially empty vesicles following secretion suggests that during the secretory process, only a portion of the vesicular contents are able to exit the cell, which could only be possible if secretory vesicles were to temporarily establish continuity with the cell plasma membrane, expel a portion of their contents, then detach and reseal.|$|R
