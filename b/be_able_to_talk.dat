5|$|Even {{before the}} Quebec Agreement was signed, Akers had already cabled London with {{instructions}} that Chadwick, Peierls, Oliphant and Francis Simon should leave immediately for North America. They arrived on 19 August, {{the day it}} was signed, expecting to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to American scientists, but were unable to do so. Two weeks would pass before American officials learnt of the contents of the Quebec Agreement. Over the next two years, the Combined Policy Committee met only eight times.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Jerry {{finds out}} from his mother that Elaine knows about the stake out. On {{the day of the}} wedding, Elaine tells Jerry that the reason that she was angry was {{because it was the first}} time she saw him flirt with another woman. They decide that they have to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> more about their {{relationships}} if they wish to remain friends. Elaine then reveals that she has recently met a man using a stake out.|$|E
5|$|Histiaeus now {{gathered}} a large force of Ionians and Aeolians {{and went to}} besiege Thasos. However, he then received {{the news that the}} Persian fleet was setting out from Miletus to attack the rest of Ionia, so he quickly returned to Lesbos. In order to feed his army, he led foraging expeditions to the mainland near Atarneus and Myus. A large Persian force under Harpagus was in the area and eventually intercepted one foraging expedition near Malene. The ensuing battle was hard fought, but was ended by a successful Persian cavalry charge, routing the Greek line. Histiaeus himself surrendered to the Persians, thinking that he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> himself into a pardon from Darius. However, he was taken to Artaphernes instead, who, fully aware of Histiaeus's past treachery, impaled him and then sent his embalmed head to Darius.|$|E

500|$|Also {{present at}} the session was David Crosby of the Byrds. He {{recalled}} his reaction to hearing the completed song: [...] "man, I was a dish-rag. I was floored. It took me several minutes to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> after that." [...] Due to the multiple takes required to perfect the orchestral cacophony and the final chord, the total time spent recording [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] was 34hours. In contrast, the Beatles' debut album, Please Please Me, had been recorded in its entirety in only 10hours, 45minutes.|$|E
500|$|At {{the police}} station, Mulder tests Bruckman's ability by having him handle various objects {{to see what}} they [...] "tell" [...] him. It becomes {{apparent}} that Bruckman's only real psychic talent is an ability to see details of people's deaths. Scully arrives with a key chain bearing the insignia of an investment company that uses astrology to make financial predictions, taken from the doll collector's body - the same key chain was found on two of the other dead fortunetellers. Bruckman knows that the firm is owned by one Claude Dukenfield, not through a psychic revelation but because he coincidentally sold the man an insurance policy recently. He says that Mulder and Scully will not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Dukenfield though, because he has been murdered.|$|E
500|$|Jimmy {{is based}} {{on one of his}} cousins, who was rather {{feminine}} and {{spent most of his time}} playing with girls rather than with boys. Jonny and Plank are inspired by one of Antonucci's childhood friends, a loner who spent most of his time outside with his blanket. He stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, and that he [...] "thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own" [...] and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do. Some wanted Plank to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> smile and blink as if he was alive, but Antonucci insisted that it should be treated as a piece of wood, brought to life by Jonny's imagination.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, New York artist Sophia Wallace {{started work}} on a {{multimedia}} project to challenge misconceptions about the clitoris. Based on O'Connell's 1998 research, Wallace's work emphasizes the sheer scope {{and size of the}} human clitoris. She says that ignorance of this still seems to be pervasive in modern society. [...] "It is a curious dilemma to observe the paradox that on the one hand the female body is the primary metaphor for sexuality, its use saturates advertising, art and the mainstream erotic imaginary," [...] she said. [...] "Yet, the clitoris, the true female sexual organ, is virtually invisible." [...] The project is called Cliteracy and it includes a [...] "clit rodeo", which is an interactive, climb-on model of a giant golden clitoris, including its inner parts, produced with the help of sculptor Kenneth Thomas. [...] "It's been a showstopper wherever it's been shown. People are hungry to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about this," [...] Wallace said. [...] "I love seeing men standing up for the clit [...] Not having access to the pleasure that is your birthright is a deeply political act." ...|$|E
500|$|Marc-Antoine Audette {{said that}} it took the duo {{about four or five}} days of calls to Palin's staff to finally <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to her. They claimed that they started by talking to {{low-level}} people in Alaska and made their way up through Palin's campaign staff. Audette said that at first they didn't think their prank would work, calling it a [...] "mission impossible". He claimed that [...] "after about a dozen calls", the duo [...] "started to realize it [...] might work, because her [...] staff didn't know the name of the French President. They asked us to spell it." [...] Audette and Trudel credited their ability to make their way up through Palin's staff to sounding convincing during the first few calls, always arranging to place the call at a set time, and not leaving a contact number. The four days of calls needed to talk to Palin was quicker compared to some of their other pranks. Audette and Trudel {{said that it}} took them two months to talk to Paul McCartney and one to talk to Bill Gates, but only two days to prank Britney Spears.|$|E
500|$|Visiting Andy in the hospital, Ann {{suddenly}} kisses him, but immediately {{stops and}} guiltily walks out. Later, April, also {{relieved to see}} Andy is fine, finally agrees {{to go out with}} him. After they kiss, Andy decides to be honest and tells her about the earlier kiss with Ann. April angrily storms out, taking back her decision to go out with him. That night, Leslie sits on a bench in the empty Lot 48 and Mark joins her, with both appearing happy to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to each other. Mark tells her that if more people like her worked in local government, he wouldn't be leaving, and gives her plans he drew up for a park at Lot 48 before giving her a goodbye kiss on the cheek and walking way forever. The next day, Ron withdraws from the budget task force and appoints Leslie in his place. As Tom (Aziz Ansari) and his new girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) are clearing out his office, he notices Ron is wearing a red shirt and black pants, the [...] "Tiger Woods" [...] outfit he always wears the day after having sex. Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) then appears and kisses Ron and the two leave together, shocking Tom.|$|E

2500|$|Patrick O'Brian {{once wrote}} [...] "Obviously, I have lived very {{much out of}} the world: I know little of present-day Dublin or London or Paris, even less of post-modernity, post-structuralism, hard rock or rap, and I cannot write with much {{conviction}} about the contemporary scene." [...] This becomes obvious for readers of the Aubrey-Maturin Series, as he adopts a narrative voice contemporary with their setting. Richard Ollard, in examining the general reception to O'Brian's books, suggests that O'Brian's naval officers would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with and recognise Jane Austen's characters.|$|E

[...] "I wanted my villain to have a 'mask,' but <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> and taunt and threaten. So I thought of him being burned and scarred." [...] He also felt the killer should use {{something other than a}} knife, which was too common. [...] "So I thought, How about a glove with steak knives? I gave the idea to our special-effects guy, Jim Doyle." [...] Ultimately two models of the glove were built: one called the [...] "hero glove" [...] used only whenever anything needs to be cut, and the other a stunt glove less likely to cause injury.|$|E
2500|$|Pamuk {{stated that}} he was {{consequently}} subjected to a hate campaign that forced him to flee the country. He returned later in 2005, however, to face the charges against him. In an interview with BBC News, {{he said that he}} wanted to defend freedom of speech, which was Turkey's only hope for coming to terms with its history: [...] "What happened to the Ottoman Armenians in 1915 was a major thing that was hidden from the Turkish nation; it was a taboo. But we have to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the past." [...] However, when Turkish television, CNN TURK asked Pamuk about his speech, he admitted that he said that [...] "Armenians were killed" [...] but he rejected that he said [...] "Turks killed Armenians" [...] and he estimated the number of deaths (as 1 million) in that speech.|$|E
