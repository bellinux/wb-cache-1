25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. I hate to say it, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> wish God had just taken me.|$|E
500|$|On the reveal, Dohring {{said in an}} interview: [...] "I’m {{actually}} glad, Rob told {{us about}} episode six or seven that we would get together. We were like, ‘No way!’ But there was something going on there. We could feel it as actors. It was damn cool – these characters {{had some kind of}} connection. So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes,</b> <b>I</b> feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me." [...] The song [...] "Momentary Thing" [...] by band Something Happens plays during Veronica and Logan's first kiss.|$|E
2500|$|The first combat A-4, {{renamed the}} V-2 (Vergeltungswaffe 2 [...] "Retaliation/Vengeance Weapon 2") for {{propaganda}} purposes, was launched toward England on September 7, 1944, only 21 {{months after the}} project had been officially commissioned. Von Braun's interest in rockets was specifically {{for the application of}} space travel, not for killing people. After hearing the news from London, he said that [...] "the rocket worked perfectly, except for landing on the wrong planet." [...] Satirist Mort Sahl is often credited with mocking von Braun with the paraphrase [...] "I aim at the stars, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> hit London." [...] In fact that line appears in the film I Aim at the Stars, a 1960 biopic of von Braun.|$|E

6000|$|Olivia knitted her brows. [...] "Jacinta {{receives}} him, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> wonder---- Anyhow, I imagine she approves you and {{you might}} find her a useful friend. People come to her when they can't see their way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They don't feel it {{as others}} would. I didn't myself. Even at present I {{may be said}} to be living on charity. <b>But</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> have fancied that in Mr. Morton's case there might be peculiarly {{mitigating}} circumstances." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, I suppose I {{must put}} up with it, as best <b>I</b> can; <b>but</b> really, <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> do envy the colonel's little terrier, which frisks along all day, making {{excursions}} occasionally into the bush, to look for rats or mongooses. He seems to be absolutely tireless, and always ready for anything.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing. <b>But</b> Clementina, <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> {{think you}} don't quite {{understand}} yourself. Don't {{you know that}} you are very pretty and very charming?

6000|$|... "Oh, thank you, I {{would like}} it very much. I have read mine over so often that I know them nearly all by heart. One cannot get tired of really {{beautiful}} things, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> feel that I would like some new books." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Aunt Emma, [...] "I am {{sure she}} will always {{remember}} {{that she is a}} Winslow, and must carry on the family traditions, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> am afraid she gets under bad influences, because of her good nature."

60|$|The picture hangs now in my library, {{where it}} is very much admired by my artistic friends. They have decided {{that it is not a}} Clouet, but an Oudry.
