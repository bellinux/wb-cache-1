5|$|As {{each region}} {{has its own}} {{traditional}} pattern, batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in, such as <b>batik</b> Solo, <b>batik</b> Pekalongan, and <b>batik</b> Madura. Batiks from Java can be distinguished by their general pattern and colours into <b>batik</b> pedalaman (inland <b>batik)</b> or <b>batik</b> pesisir (coastal <b>batik).</b> Batiks which do not fall neatly {{into one of these}} two categories are only referred to by their region. A mapping of <b>batik</b> designs from all places in Indonesia depicts the similarities and reflects cultural assimilation within <b>batik</b> designs.|$|E

5|$|<b>Batik</b> {{garments}} play {{a central}} role in certain Javanese rituals, such as the ceremonial casting of royal <b>batik</b> into a volcano. In the Javanese naloni mitoni ceremony, the mother-to-be is wrapped in seven layers of <b>batik,</b> wishing her good things. <b>Batik</b> is also prominent in the tedak siten ceremony when a child touches the earth for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Sundanese or Priangan <b>Batik</b> is {{the term}} for <b>batik</b> from the Priangan region of West Java and Banten. Although Priangan batiks can use {{a wide range of}} colours, a {{preference}} for indigo is seen in some of its variants. Natural indigo dye made from Indigofera is among the oldest known dyes in Java, and its local name tarum has lent its name to the Citarum river and the Tarumanagara kingdom, which suggests that ancient West Java was once a major producer of natural indigo. Noted Priangan <b>batik</b> is produced in Ciamis, Garut, and Tasikmalaya. Other traditions include <b>Batik</b> Kuningan influenced by <b>batik</b> Cirebon, <b>batik</b> Banten that developed quite independently, and an older tradition of <b>batik</b> Baduy.|$|E

5|$|The most {{traditional}} type of <b>batik,</b> called <b>batik</b> tulis (written <b>batik),</b> is drawn using only the canting.

The whole process may take up to a year; it yields considerably finer patterns than stamped <b>batik.</b>|$|E
5|$|Trade {{relations}} between the Melayu Kingdom in Jambi and Javanese coastal cities have thrived since the 13th century. Therefore, coastal <b>batik</b> from northern Java probably influenced Jambi. In 1875, Haji Mahibat from Central Java revived the declining <b>batik</b> industry in Jambi. The village of Mudung Laut in Pelayangan district is known for producing <b>batik</b> Jambi. <b>Batik</b> Jambi, as well as Javanese <b>batik,</b> influenced the Malaysian <b>batik.</b>|$|E

5|$|Coastal <b>batik</b> is {{produced}} in several areas of northern Java and Madura. In contrast to inland <b>batik,</b> coastal batiks have vibrant colours and patterns inspired by {{a wide range of}} cultures as a consequence of maritime trading. Recurring motifs include European flower bouquets, Chinese phoenix, and Persian peacocks. Noted coastal batiks are produced in Pekalongan, Cirebon, Lasem, Tuban, and Madura. Pekalongan has the most active <b>batik</b> industry.|$|E
5|$|In Subsaharan Africa, Javanese <b>batik</b> was {{introduced}} in the 19th century by Dutch and English traders. The local people there adapted the Javanese <b>batik,</b> making larger motifs with thicker lines and more colours. In the 1970s, <b>batik</b> {{was introduced}} to Australia, where aboriginal artists at Erna Bella have developed it as their own craft.|$|E
5|$|Inland <b>batik</b> or <b>batik</b> kraton (Javanese court <b>batik)</b> is {{the oldest}} form of <b>batik</b> {{tradition}} known in Java. Inland <b>batik</b> has earthy colour such as black, indigo, brown, and sogan (brown-yellow colour made from the tree Peltophorum pterocarpum), sometimes against a white background, with symbolic patterns that are mostly free from outside influence. Certain patterns are reserved for royalty, while other are worn on specific occasions. At a Javanese wedding for example, the bride wears specific patterns at each stage of the ceremony. Noted inland batiks are produced in Solo and Jogjakarta, cities traditionally regarded as the centre of Javanese culture. <b>Batik</b> Solo typically has sogan background and is preserved by the Susuhunan and Mangkunegaran Court. <b>Batik</b> Jogja typically has white background and is preserved by the Yogyakarta Sultanate and Pakualaman Court.|$|E

5|$|Many Indonesian <b>batik</b> {{patterns}} are symbolic. Infants are carried in <b>batik</b> slings decorated with symbols {{designed to bring}} the child luck, and certain <b>batik</b> designs are reserved for brides and bridegrooms, {{as well as their}} families. Some designs are reserved for royalties, and even banned to be worn by commoners. Consequently, a person's rank could be determined by the pattern of the <b>batik</b> he or she wore. Further study to the geometry of symbolism in Indonesian <b>batik</b> showed the applicability of fractal geometry in traditional designs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>batik</b> {{industry}} of Java flourished {{from the late}} 1800s to early 1900s, but declined during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia. With increasing preference of western clothing, the <b>batik</b> industry further declined following the Indonesian independence. <b>Batik</b> has somewhat revived {{at the turn of}} the 21st century, through the efforts of Indonesian fashion designers to innovate <b>batik</b> by incorporating new colours, fabrics, and patterns. <b>Batik</b> has become a fashion item for many Indonesians, and may be seen on shirts, dresses, or scarves for casual wear; it is a preferred replacement for jacket-and-tie at certain receptions. Traditional <b>batik</b> sarongs are still used in many occasions.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Malaysian <b>batik</b> making is {{different}} from those of Indonesian Javanese <b>batik,</b> the pattern being larger and simpler with only occasional use of the canting to create intricate patterns. It relies heavily on brush painting to apply colours to fabrics. The colours also tend to be lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese <b>batik.</b> The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers. Malaysian <b>batik</b> often displays plants and flowers to avoid the interpretation of human and animal images as idolatry, in accordance with local Islamic doctrine. However, the butterfly theme is a common exception.|$|E
