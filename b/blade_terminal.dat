[...] For example, fuse holders for North American class RK fuses have a pin that prevents installation of similar-appearing class H fuses, which have a much lower breaking capacity and a solid <b>blade</b> <b>terminal</b> that lacks the slot of the RK type.|$|E
40|$|Objetivou-se avaliar a distribuição dos fotoassimilados pelos perfilhos do {{cultivar}} Mombaça de Panicum maximum. Os tratamentos experimentais resultaram de um arranjo fatorial 2 x 2 x 3 - dois níveis de inserção da folha (topo e base), dois estádios de desenvolvimento da planta e três momentos de colheita (3, 8 e 24 horas após a exposição da folha ao 14 CO 2). O delineamento utilizado foi inteiramente casualizado, com três repetições. A exposição ao 14 CO 2 teve duração de 20 minutos. Cada planta foi desmembrada em perfilho principal e perfilhos surgidos no primeiro e segundo estádios de desenvolvimento. O perfilho principal foi dividido em: folha adulta, completamente expandida exposta ao 14 CO 2 (bainha mais lâmina), demais folhas adultas (bainha mais lâmina), meristema terminal (folha emergente mais folha em expansão mais meristema apical), base e raiz. A atividade das amostras foi determinada em espectrômetro de cintilação líquida. A percentagem de fotoassimilados 14 C retida na folha exposta não variou com o tempo de colheita, após exposição. Mais da metade da radioatividade recuperada na planta foi retida no perfilho principal. A folha do topo reteve mais assimilados que a folha da base, que translocou maior percentual de assimilados para os perfilhos que a folha do topo. O percentual de assimilados retidos no perfilho principal foi mais alto em plantas do primeiro estádio de desenvolvimento em relação às do segundo estádio. As folhas adultas e a raiz do perfilho principal se constituíram nos seus principais drenos. Apreciável percentagem de assimilados marcados foi encontrada nas folhas adultas não-expostas do perfilho principal. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate the distribution of assimilates produced by {{the top and bottom}} leaves of the main tiller in plants of Monbaçagrass (Panicum maximum), in two stages of plant development, and three harvest times after plant exposure to 14 CO 2 (three, eight and twenty four hours). The experimental treatments were arranged in a 2 X 2 X 3 factorial combination. The experimental design utilized was completely randomized. The exposure time to 14 CO 2 was 20 minutes. Each plant was separated into shoot (main tiller) and tillers developed in the first and second stages of plant development. The shoot was dissected into the following fractions: fully expanded leaves (sheath plus blade), fed leaf (sheath plus <b>blade),</b> <b>terminal</b> meristem (expanding leaves plus emerging leaves plus apical meristem), base and root system. The radioactivity of the samples was determined in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The percentage of 14 C-assimilates retained in the fed leaf did not vary with time of harvesting after exposure. Most of the plant 14 C assimilates were retained in the main tiller, mainly when the fed leaf was the top one, which retained more assimilates than the bottom leaf. The bottom leaf translocated more assimilates to tillers than the top leaf. Percentage assimilates retained in main tiller was higher in plants of the first developmental stage relative to the second one. Sizeable amount of activity was found in non-fed adult leaves of the main tiller, mainly when the bottom leaf was the fed one...|$|E
25|$|Fuses for {{low voltage}} power {{circuits}} may have bolted <b>blade</b> or tag <b>terminals</b> which are secured by screws to a fuseholder. Some blade-type terminals {{are held by}} spring clips. Blade type fuses often {{require the use of}} a special purpose extractor tool to remove them from the fuse holder.|$|R
30|$|The leaf sheaths {{of grass}} species are {{considered}} to function as temporal storage tissues for accumulating excess photoassimilates, and as conducting tissues that connect source leaf <b>blades</b> with <b>terminal</b> sink tissues such as roots and developing leaves (for recent review see Slewinski [2012]). In comparison with the WT, leaf sheaths of lse 1 and les 3 contained significantly larger quantities of starch only in tissues sampled in the morning, and those of lse 2 accumulated larger amounts of starch regardless of leaf age or sampling time (Figure  4 C,D). Soluble sugar levels in leaf sheaths were similar between lse mutants and WT, or were lower in the mutants, except for the fourth leaf sheath of lse 2, in which sucrose levels {{were significantly higher than}} those of WT in both morning and evening.|$|R
50|$|Deep brown {{color on}} {{flattened}} rhizomes which are profusely dichotomously branched. Each is attached by branched root-like structures {{coming out of}} the sides of the rhizomes. Slender main stipes (about 1 cm wide to 30 m long) come from the rhizome which is up to 0.1 m at the widest. Periodically 5 cm wide and 35 cm long flattened leaf-like branches derive from the stipe. They have furrowed surfaces and taper gradually, but then have an oval or rounded float where attached to the stipe. The blade-like branches have notched denticulate edges leading to the <b>terminal</b> <b>blade</b> {{at the tip of the}} stipe, which is separated by several smaller branches.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to insert wiring without the proper tool, but this requires great care to avoid damaging the connectors. For example, pushing a screwdriver {{down the middle of}} the block is a bad practice as it forces the two <b>blades</b> of the <b>terminal</b> post apart, leading to bad contacts. It is also possible to punch-down multiple wires on top of each other in a single post of a punch-down block, but this practice is discouraged because of reliability concerns. If these multiple wires are of different thicknesses (wire gauges), it is even more likely that the thinner wire will develop contact problems. Similarly, stranded wire can be used on punch-down blocks, even though they were originally designed for solid wire connections.|$|R
5000|$|P. californica {{is a large}} {{brown seaweed}} and may grow to about three metres in height. It is {{attached}} to a rocky substrate by its holdfast and has a single, tough, woody stipe or stem up to two metres long and 2 cm (0.8 in) in diameter. It is a long-lived perennial plant which may survive for twenty-five years, and annual growth rings {{can be seen in the}} stipe. There are a number of smooth blades arranged on either side of the top half of the stipe. These are sporophylls and bear reproductive organs called sporangia in which the spores are formed. The <b>terminal</b> <b>blade</b> is linear, has a midrib and is larger than the others, growing up to 90 cm (33 in) long.|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{data were}} {{acquired}} during a flight test in 1995 of a UH- 60 L Black Hawk equipped with Growth Rotor <b>Blades</b> (GRB) performing <b>terminal</b> area operations. Limited acoustic {{data from the}} same aircraft equipped with Standard Rotor Blades (SRB) were also acquired. These data were analyzed and compared with data from a 1993 flight test of a UH- 60 A aircraft to assess differences in acoustics characteristics between {{the two types of}} blades. This paper presents dBA and Sound Exposure Level (SEL) acoustic data from level flight and approach conditions for the GRB, and the SRB, both from this test and the earlier, 1993 test. An expected increase in levels with increase in air speed of the GRB-equipped aircraft was observed in both level flight and approach. Comparisons between the GRB and the SRB data from the same 1995 test show no acoustic improvement in level flight, but a significant improvement in approach for the helicopter equipped with the GRB. Comparisons between GRB data from the 19 [...] ...|$|R
