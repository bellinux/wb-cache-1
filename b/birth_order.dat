5|$|Results {{of studies}} {{comprise}} another {{third of the}} core of Schizophrenia and Genetics. The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop schizophrenia under environmental pressures. The study was not designed to find the genes responsible, but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in tandem.Contextual elements responsible could not be identified, though some, such as an overly protective mother, <b>birth</b> <b>order,</b> natal weight, and social and economic elements were ruled out. Gottesman and Shields found roughly half of identical twins had a shared schizophrenic or non-schizophrenic status, but only one-eleventh of fraternal twins had such a shared diagnosis. MMPI scales coincided among identical twin pairs but not among fraternal twin pairs. The Object Sorting Test showed no useful relations. Those meeker than their twins were more liable to develop schizophrenia where their genes already put them at risk.|$|E

40|$|The paper investigates {{determinants}} of birth weight in Kenya {{in the early}} 1990 s using data from welfare monitoring surveys collected by the Central Bureau of Statistics, Ministry of Planning and National Development. It is shown that immunization of the mother against tetanus during pregnancy has a strong positive effect on birth weight. Other {{determinants of}} birth weight include age of the mother at first <b>birth</b> and <b>birth</b> <b>orders</b> of siblings. It is further shown that birth weight is positively associated with mothers age at first birth and with higher <b>birth</b> <b>orders,</b> with the first born child being significantly lighter than subsequent children. Moreover, birth weights are lower in rural than in urban areas and females are born lighter than males. There is tentative evidence that babies born at the clinics are heavier than babies from the general population...|$|R

25|$|Within families, it {{is often}} {{considered}} inappropriate or even offensive to use the given names of relatives who are senior to the speaker. Instead, it is more customary to identify each family member by abstract hierarchical connections: among siblings, gender and <b>birth</b> <b>order</b> (big sister, second sister, and so on); for the extended family, the manner of relationship (by birth or marriage; from the maternal or paternal side).|$|E

This {{is applied to}} a sample of the marriage and maternity histories from the Census of England and Wales of 1971 and shows: (a) a general increase through the 1950 s and into the 1960 s in period estimates of marriage and parity progression ratios, especially in the progression from first to second birth; (b) a general acceleration of fertility with, again, the second birth interval becoming particularly short and compact; and (c) very steep declines in third and fourth birth progression ratios from the mid- 1960 s. Birth interval distributions altered during the period examined. Decomposition of a progression-based total fertility index shows change in the ratios for lower <b>birth</b> <b>orders</b> to have dominated the fertility upswing and declines in ratios for higher <b>birth</b> <b>orders</b> to have initiated the subsequent decline...|$|R
50|$|A few jurisdictions {{do provide}} for pre-birth orders, {{generally}} in only those cases when the surrogate mother is not genetically {{related to the}} expected child. Some jurisdictions impose other requirements in <b>order</b> to issue <b>birth</b> <b>orders,</b> for example, that the intended parents be heterosexual and married to one another.

40|$|The paper investigates {{birth weight}} and its {{correlates}} in Kenya using nationally representative {{data collected by}} the government in the early 1990 s. I find that immunisation of the mother against tetanus during pregnancy is strongly associated with improvements in birth weight. Other factors significantly correlated with birth weight include age of mother at first <b>birth</b> and <b>birth</b> <b>orders</b> of siblings. It is further found that birth weight is positively associated with mother's age at first birth and with higher <b>birth</b> <b>orders,</b> with the firstborn child being substantially lighter than subsequent children. Newborn infants born in urban areas are heavier than those from rural areas and females are lighter than males. There is evidence suggesting that a baby born at a clinic is heavier than a newborn baby drawn randomly from the general population. Copyright 2009 The author 2008.

25|$|There is no {{consensus}} among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual orientation. Proposed reasons include a combination of genetic factors and environmental factors (including fraternal <b>birth</b> <b>order,</b> where the number of older brothers a boy has increases the chances of homosexuality; specific prenatal hormone exposure, where hormones {{play a role in}} determining sexual orientation as they do with sex differentiation; and prenatal stress on the mother).|$|E
25|$|The {{decline in}} {{economic}} activities {{since the early}} 1980s has made education a luxury to many Nigerians, especially those in rural areas. Because Nigerian parents are known to invest in children according to sex, <b>birth</b> <b>order</b> or natural endowments, girls and boys are not exact substitutes. Often the family can only afford to send one child to school. Because daughters have assumed responsibilities in the home, she {{is less likely to}} be the one to attend school.|$|E
25|$|When Oba Ologun Kutere died (between 1800 and 1805), a {{succession}} struggle ensued between his older son (Osinlokun) {{and his younger}} and preferred son (Adele).

30|$|Nonetheless, the {{practice}} of son preference in reproductive behavior among certain immigrant groups may change across time. Tønnessen and colleagues (2013) demonstrate a changing trend of SRB among Indian immigrants in Norway. In the period between 2006 and 2012, Indian-born women gave birth to more girls than boys at higher <b>birth</b> <b>orders.</b> This result contradicts findings for earlier periods and other Western societies, implying that later immigrant cohorts or immigrants who have resided in the host country {{for a long time}} may have new sex preferences for children.|$|R
25|$|While {{direct support}} {{has not been}} found for these hypotheses, {{evidence}} that favours this theory exists. Further, while percentages of the likelihood of homosexuality have been estimated to be increased by 15–48% per older brother, these odds really account {{for only a few}} percent of the population; thus, this hypothesis cannot be universally applied to the majority of homosexual men. Not all studies have been able to reproduce the fraternal <b>birth</b> <b>order</b> effect. Some did not find any statistically significant difference in either the sibling composition or rate of older brothers of gay and straight men, including large, nationally representative studies in the US and Denmark.|$|E
25|$|Baller (2006) {{examines}} {{family dynamics}} and mobilization for the Revolution in central Massachusetts. He reports that warfare and the farming culture were sometimes incompatible. Militiamen found that {{living and working}} on the family farm had not prepared them for wartime marches and the rigors of camp life. Rugged individualism conflicted with military discipline and regimentation. A man's <b>birth</b> <b>order</b> often influenced his military recruitment, as younger sons went to war and older sons {{took charge of the}} farm. A person's family responsibilities and the prevalent patriarchy could impede mobilization. Harvesting duties and family emergencies pulled men home regardless of the sergeant's orders. Some relatives might be Loyalists, creating internal strains. On the whole, historians conclude the Revolution's effect on patriarchy and inheritance patterns favored egalitarianism.|$|E
25|$|The {{method used}} in Hereditary Genius has been {{described}} as the first example of historiometry. To bolster these results, and to attempt to make a distinction between 'nature' and 'nurture' (he was the first to apply this phrase to the topic), he devised a questionnaire that he sent out to 190 Fellows of the Royal Society. He tabulated characteristics of their families, such as <b>birth</b> <b>order</b> and the occupation and race of their parents. He attempted to discover whether their interest in science was 'innate' or due to the encouragements of others. The studies were published as a book, English men of science: their nature and nurture, in 1874. In the end, it promoted the nature versus nurture question, though it did not settle it, and provided some fascinating data on the sociology of scientists of the time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the outcome of birth and relevant factors among Vietnam foreign-spouse mothers in comparison with Taiwanese mothers. 1664 newborns, that delivered by Vietnam and Taiwanese mothers, born between January 1, 1998 and June 30, 2002 from a southern town in Taiwan were studies. Compared to Taiwanese mothers, Vietnam mothers were found to deliver smaller babies (3035 g vs 3137 g, p< 0. 05) with a higher proportion of low birthweight (7. 1 % vs 4. 8 %). After adjusting for gender, <b>birth</b> <b>orders,</b> term status and maternal age, the risk (Odds Ratio) of delivering low birthweight newborns for Vietnam mothers compared to Taiwanese mothers was 1. 42 (95 %CI= 0. 45 - 4. 50). In a sub-study, from the same population, 101 Taiwanese mothers were matched to 66 Vietnam mothers by maternal age, term status and <b>birth</b> <b>orders.</b> In sub-study, the risk estimation of low birthweight delivery were increased to twofold for Vietnam mothers compared to Taiwanese mothers (OR= 1. 99, 95 %CI= 0. 51 - 7. 69). Further controlling for gender of newborns, food intake, smoking status, and paternal work status, the OR turned into 2. 49 (95 %CI= 0. 53 - 11. 82). This study suggests that maternal origins have potential impact on birth outcomes. Comparing to Taiwanese mothers, Vietnam mothers in Taiwan were having more adverse health and social situations regarding to the pregnancy...|$|R

25|$|Known as the fraternal <b>birth</b> <b>order</b> (FBO) effect, {{this theory}} has been backed up by strong {{evidence}} of its prenatal origin, although no evidence thus far has linked it to an exact prenatal mechanism. However, research suggests {{that this may be}} of immunological origin, caused by a maternal immune reaction against a substance crucial to male fetal development during pregnancy, which becomes increasingly likely after every male gestation. As a result of this immune effect, alterations in later-born males' prenatal development have been thought to occur. This process, known as the maternal immunization hypothesis (MIH), would begin when cells from a male fetus enter the mother's circulation during pregnancy or while giving birth. These Y-linked proteins would not be recognized in the mother's immune system because she is female, causing her to develop antibodies which would travel through the placental barrier into the fetal compartment. From here, the anti-male bodies would then cross the blood/brain barrier (BBB) of the developing fetal brain, altering sex-dimorphic brain structures relative to sexual orientation, causing the exposed son to be more attracted to men over women.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, {{research}} was conducted for [...] "The Recontact Study", funded by the Markle Foundation, which {{examined the effects of}} Sesame Street on adolescents who had watched the show as young children. The subjects had participated in previous studies as preschoolers. When the study's research subjects were statistically equated for parents' level of education, <b>birth</b> <b>order,</b> residence and gender, it found that adolescents who had watched Sesame Street as preschoolers were positively influenced by it. Compared with children who had not watched it regularly, they had higher grades in English, math, and science; read for pleasure more often; perceived themselves as more competent, and expressed lower levels of aggression. The effects were stronger in adolescent boys than in adolescent girls.|$|E
500|$|Iftah Ya Simsim {{inspired}} [...] "a {{flood of}} studies", from scientific research to doctoral or masters theses submitted to Arab, European, and American universities. No studies were {{conducted during the}} show's first five years, largely {{due to lack of}} government cooperation and unsuccessful attempts marred by subjects dropping out of the studies. In 1981, however, the JPPI invited children from Arab countries to Kuwait to access how they assimilated the program. Their attitudes about the show were assessed by education, social, and media specialists, who found that most viewers had benefited from watching it. Parents reported that their children's language use and ability improved, and the JPPI received many letters of appreciation and was commended for their efforts in producing the show. In 1984, in one of the first studies conducted researching the show's effects on its young viewers, Ibrahim Al-Khulaifi compared the relationship between the viewing behavior by the Kuwaiti preschooler of Iftah Ya Simsim and certain developmental and environmental variables. He found that variables such as socioeconomic status, parental education (especially that of the mother), sex, age, year in school, <b>birth</b> <b>order,</b> and family attitudes about the show influenced the frequency of viewing.|$|E

500|$|It is {{possible}} that Vladimir decided that neither Sviatopolk nor Yaroslav would succeed to the Kievan throne after his death, as both Sviatopolk and Yaroslav revolted against their father.

Although Sviatopolk {{is known to have}} been older than Boris and Gleb, the exact <b>birth</b> <b>order</b> of Vladimir's sons is not known and Sviatopolk is alleged in some sources to have been a bastard.

According to Thietmar of Merseburg, Bolesław encouraged Sviatopolk's revolt through his daughter and the latter's wife, though he does not specify the goal of the revolt. Sviatopolk's conspiracy was, in the event, thwarted by Vladimir, who called Sviatopolk and his entourage to Kiev and jailed them in 1013.|$|E
