2500|$|British {{magazine}} The Economist, in May 2016, called Ban [...] "plodding, protocol-conscious and loth {{to stand}} up to the big powers" [...] and [...] "the dullest—and among the worst" [...] secretary-generals. Japanese diplomat Kiyotaka Akasaka defended Ban's understated presence as more quietly Confucian, stating that [...] " [...] behaviour has <b>been</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of the wise man, the sage in Oriental philosophy". One UN official claimed that while Ban would greet world leaders in their native language, he would then read directly from his talking points without small talk. The UN official opined, [...] "Quiet diplomacy? He [...] displayed no skills for that.” South African lawyer Nicholas Haysom also defended Ban, saying that the news media [...] "caricatured [...] as invisible when he made outspoken comments that the media then failed to report".|$|E
2500|$|The areas {{occupied}} by the tsetse fly were largely barred to animal husbandry. Sleeping sickness was dubbed [...] "the best game warden in Africa" [...] by conservationists, who assumed that the land, empty of people and full of game animals, had always <b>been</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Julian Huxley of the World Wildlife Fund called the plains of east Africa [...] "a surviving sector of the rich natural world {{as it was before}} the rise of modern man". They created numerous large reserves for hunting safaris. In 1909 the newly retired president Theodore Roosevelt went on a safari that returned over 10,000 animal carcases to America. Later, much of the land was turned over to nature reserves and national parks such as the Serengeti, Masai Mara, Kruger and Okavango Delta. The result, across eastern and southern Africa, is a modern landscape of manmade ecosystems: farmland and pastoral land largely free of bush and tsetse fly; and bush controlled by the tsetse fly.|$|E
