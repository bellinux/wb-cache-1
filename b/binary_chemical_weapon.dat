In November 2007, it {{successfully completed}} {{destruction of the}} <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> inventory. In January 2012, all chemical weapons had been destroyed at the 7 sites CMA had responsibility for, with 89.75% of the U.S.'s 1997 stockpile eliminated.|$|E
50|$|In the end, the BLU-80/B BIGEYE <b>binary</b> <b>{{chemical}}</b> <b>weapon</b> {{may well}} have been the tipping point in chemical weapons disarmament talks with the then USSR, as the Soviets agreed to significant chemical weapons disarmament agreements immediately after successful operational test results of the BIGEYE resulting from improvements implemented by the U.S. Navy's Naval Air Weapons Center, China Lake.|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} a <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> is the United States Army M687. In the M687, methylphosphonyl difluoride (military name: DF, a Schedule 1 chemical) and a mixture of 2 agents held in {{chambers}} within the munition, separated by a partition. When the weapon is fired, acceleration causes the partition to break, and the precursors are mixed by {{the rotation of the}} munition in flight, producing sarin nerve agent.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Army Chemical Corps was {{reactivated}} in 1976 {{to assess}} and deal with this threat, and with it came the increased desire to acquire a retaliatory chemical capability {{in the form of}} much safer <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons.</b> Initially, the United States was in with the Soviet Union, and then-President Jimmy Carter rejected U.S. Army requests for authorization of the <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> program. The talks deteriorated, and President Carter eventually granted the request Army request. However, at the last minute Carter pulled the provision from the budget. This action left the decision on a retaliatory <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> option to the Ronald Reagan administration.|$|R
50|$|<b>Binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> are <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> {{within the}} scope of the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> Convention and {{therefore}} their production, use and stockpiling is forbidden in most countries, as {{at least one of the}} individual chemicals is likely to be a Schedule 1 chemical for which large scale production is forbidden.|$|R
5000|$|QL is a {{component}} in <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons,</b> mainly VX nerve agent. It, along with Methylphosphonyl difluoride (DF), was {{developed during the}} 1980s in order to replace an aging stockpile of unitary <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons.</b> QL is listed as a [...] "Schedule One" [...] chemical by the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> Convention.|$|R
5000|$|The 2002 movie xXx {{features}} a Soviet-made <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> codenamed [...] "Silent Night", after its supposed ability to render an area silent by killing its inhabitants. In the movie, the chemical {{was acquired by}} the terrorist group Anarchy-99, and their leader, Yorgi, plans to launch missiles containing Silent Night from an autonomous solar-powered submarine called Ahab, {{with the intent to}} sow chaos among civilized nations as they all blame each other for the attacks.|$|E
5000|$|The BLU-80/B BIGEYE {{bomb was}} a {{developmental}} U.S. air-launched <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon.</b> The BIGEYE was a 500-pound class glide bomb with a radar altimeter fuze intended to disperse the binary generated nerve agent VX, made in {{flight from the}} non-lethal chemical components [...] "QL" [...] and sulfur only after aircraft release. The BLU-80-B was designed {{under the auspices of}} the U.S. Navy as a safe chemical weapons alternative in response to chemical weapons (CW) threats from the USSR and other actors. BIGEYE was a genuine tri-Service program led by the U.S. Navy with significant U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force participation. Initially approved in the 1950s, the program persisted into the 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|On 24 February, Malaysia's {{police chief}} Khalid Abu Bakar {{announced}} that a post-mortem toxicology report had found traces of the nerve agent VX on Kim's face. According to experts, the use of VX gas may explain why two assailants were involved, because each assailant [...] "could have wiped two or more precursors" [...] in Kim's face. This {{is referred to as}} a <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon.</b> This method could ensure that the assailants were not themselves killed by the poison, which can be fatal in very small amounts; additionally, smuggling the chemical components into Malaysia separately could have helped avoid detection. Aisyah reported she vomited in the taxi afterward and has continued to feel unwell.|$|E
50|$|Together with {{isopropyl}} alcohol {{it is used}} in some <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> (e.g. M687), as a mixture called OPA which in turn mixed with methylphosphonyl difluoride (known to the military as DF) produces sarin gas.|$|R
50|$|<b>Binary</b> <b>{{chemical}}</b> <b>weapons</b> or munitions are <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> {{which contain}} the toxic agent in its active state as chemical precursors which are significantly less toxic than the agent. This improves {{the safety of}} storing, transporting, and disposing of the weapon. Commonly, firing the munition removes a barrier between two precursors. These react to form the intended agent which is then aerosolized and distributed by a bursting charge.|$|R
50|$|Numbers are {{occasionally}} {{added to}} military symbols to reflect particular preparations. With riot control agents a 1 signifies micropulverized (e.g., CS1), and a 2 signified microencapsulated (e.g., CS2). With biological agents a 1 signifies a wet-type agent (e.g., UL1), and a 2 signifies a dry-type agent (e.g., UL2). <b>Binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> are signified {{by adding a}} 2, as in binary sarin (i.e., GB2).|$|R
5000|$|BIGEYE (an {{acronym for}} Binary Internally Generated {{chemical}} weapon within the [...] "EYE" [...] series of 500 pound canister weapons) was the common {{name for the}} BLU-80/B, a concept conceived during the 1950s. During the 1970s at Pine Bluff Arsenal around 200 test articles were produced. Initial production contracts for the BIGEYE were awarded in June, 1988, to The Marquardt Company of Van Nuys, CA, the project's prime contractor {{for most of the}} program. The original timeline for the U.S. binary chemical weapons program called for the BIGEYE to be deployed by September 1988. President Reagan authorized the spending of more than $59 million in 1986 to revive the binary chemical weapons program. Under the original timeline, the BIGEYE was to be the second <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> to be produced (the first being a binary artillery shell) with binary chemical agent rockets to follow. After a General Accounting Office (GAO) report pointed out numerous flaws in the program the U.S. Senate moved to effectively kill the binary chemical weapons program, including the BIGEYE bomb. In 1989 President George H.W. Bush announced that the U.S. would retain the option to produce such binary weapons. At the time of his announcement, 1992 was the earliest date BIGEYES were expected to be deployed.|$|E
50|$|As the {{stockpile}} of U.S. unitary (live agent) <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> {{began to show}} troubling leakage, the Department of Defense (DoD) became {{acutely aware of the}} safety hazard to military personnel and public backlash this could generate. It is now known that the Soviets experienced the same and likely worse leakage issues with their unitary live agent weapons. With this in mind, the Pentagon insisted that it needed a <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> program to counter and deter a Soviet or third-world chemical attack threat.|$|R
5000|$|Pine Bluff Arsenal stored 90,409 M55 GB rockets, 19,608 M55 VX rockets, 9,378 M23 VX landmines and 3,705 mustard ton containers. It {{was also}} the home for the <b>Binary</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> Facility. The {{facility}} created the two toxic agents that would combine to form VX as well as built the bombs to deliver the nerve agent. Construction of the facility began in the mid-1980s and was mothballed prior to completion in the early 1990s {{as part of the}} <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> treaties [...]|$|R
50|$|The 25 {{year old}} plus, on again off again, BIGEYE bomb program was plagued with {{problems}} and controversy from its outset. Much {{of the controversy}} was based on inaccurate and uninformed analysis by the then Government Accountability Office (GAO). The Army Chemical Corps was accused of interest in <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> only to enhance its recent reactivation; critics also charged the Army was opposed to arms control talks. Also criticized was the entire idea of a modern American <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> program. Such a program, the argument went, would actually encourage others to develop <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons,</b> as opposed to acting as a deterrent.|$|R
5000|$|VX {{can also}} be {{delivered}} in <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> which mix in-flight to form the agent prior to release. Binary VX {{is referred to as}} VX2, [...] and is created by mixing O-(2-diisopropylaminoethyl) O&prime;-ethyl methylphosphonite (Agent QL) with elemental sulfur (Agent NE) as is done in the Bigeye aerial chemical bomb. It may also be produced by mixing with sulfur compounds, as with the liquid dimethyl polysulfide mixture (Agent NM) in the canceled XM736 8-inch projectile program.|$|R
5000|$|Along with nerve agents such as tabun and VX, sarin {{can have}} a short shelf life. Therefore, it is usually stored as two {{separate}} precursors that produce sarin when combined. [...] Sarin's shelf life can be extended by increasing {{the purity of the}} precursor and intermediates and incorporating stabilizers such as tributylamine. In some formulations, tributylamine is replaced by diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), allowing sarin to be stored in aluminium casings. In <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons,</b> the two precursors are stored separately in the same shell and mixed to form the agent immediately before or when the shell is in flight. This approach has the dual benefit of solving the stability issue and increasing the safety of sarin munitions.|$|R
50|$|The M687 is an American 155 mm <b>binary</b> sarin <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> {{artillery}} shell. The {{design was}} standardized in 1976 and production began on December 16, 1987 at Pine Bluff Arsenal, Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Production was halted three years later, following a June 1990 <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> destruction treaty with Russia, and {{the dismantling of}} existing stocks began in November 1997 at Hawthorne Army Depot, Nevada. America's remaining stocks were stored at the Deseret Chemical Depot, Utah, and the Umatilla Chemical Depot (Umatilla County, Oregon).|$|R
50|$|Pine Bluff Former Production Facilities: PBA once housed two {{chemical}} warfare production facilities, and NSCMP {{was charged with}} destroying them {{to comply with the}} CWC. Destroyed in 1999, the BZ Fill Facility filled munitions with the agent BZ, a hallucinogen. In 2003, NSCMP began demolition of the former Pine Bluff Integrated Binary Production Facilities (PB IBPF), designed to produce <b>binary</b> <b>chemicals</b> and fill <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons.</b> These weapons were designed to mix two non-lethal chemicals to form a chemical agent in flight to a target. The DF Production/M20 Canister Fill and Close Facility was the only facility operated. From 1988 to 1990 it produced the binary precursor methylphosphonic difluoride (DF), inserting the chemical into coffee can-sized M20 canisters for use in the M687 155 mm Binary Artillery Projectile. The BLU-80/B Bigeye Bomb Fill Facility, QL Production Facility and DC Production Facility never operated, and all were demolished. The final remaining PB IBPF building, intended to fill binary munitions for the Multiple Launch Rocket System, but never used for that purpose, was reutilized as the Pine Bluff Binary Destruction Facility (PB BDF), to neutralize the <b>binary</b> precursor <b>chemicals</b> DF and QL. After neutralization was completed in October 2006, demolition of the building commenced. Completed on Dec. 28, 2006, it marked the end of the PB IBPF demolition and the last former {{chemical warfare}} production facility destroyed in the United States. This accomplishment was significant since it enabled NSCMP to surpass the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> Convention (CWC) treaty milestone of demolition of all the nation’s former production facilities four months ahead of schedule. Approximately 2,800 tons of metal were recycled from the IBPF.|$|R
50|$|Methylphosphonyl difluoride (DF), {{also called}} methyl difluorophosphite, methylphosphonic difluoride, and difluoromethylphosphine oxide, is a <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> precursor.
