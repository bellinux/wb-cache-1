25|$|When he {{was really}} down, {{depressed}} about things. A relationship had failed. He rang me in a terrible state {{and asked me to}} go down to his house in Frankston. Joan, my wife, said you <b>better</b> <b>go.</b> He sounded really desperate. There wasn't much he could do for such a long time. Of course, when he did start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can understand in those days. The times have changed. It's almost compulsory to be homosexual now.|$|E

Talking to the media after the match, Solo reflected upon the tournament so far, [...] "It was a hard-fought road [...] It hasn't been easy, {{but this is where}} we expected to be.

Howell {{testified that}} after the fire began, Kehoe warned him and three boys to leave the farm, saying [...] "Boys, you are my friends, you {{better get out of}} here, you <b>better</b> <b>go</b> down to the school." [...] Three telephone linemen working near Bath testified that Kehoe passed them on the road toward the school, and they saw him arrive there. He swerved his truck and {{stopped in front of the}} building. In the next instant, according to the linemen, the truck blew up, and one of them was struck by shrapnel. [...] Other witnesses testified that Kehoe paused after stopping and called Superintendent Huyck over before blowing up his truck.|$|E

500|$|Senior {{executives}} at publishers Michael Joseph {{and at the}} Sunday Times, which serialised the book, received threatening phone calls and a visit from private investigator Eugene Ingram, {{who worked for the}} Church. Another private investigator, Jarl Grieve Einar Cynewulf, told Sunday Times journalists that he had been offered [...] "large sums of money" [...] to find a link between Miller and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as the Church reportedly believed that the CIA was driving investigations into its tax affairs in the U.S. According to Cynewulf, Miller's mail and phones were intercepted and his home was under constant surveillance. The newspaper reported that Cynewulf had chased its reporter and photographer through the streets of Bristol, armed with a pistol which he fired at them, saying, [...] "You'd <b>better</b> <b>go</b> now unless you want to end up in a wooden box. Do you want to be another Hungerford martyr?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{initial set}} release date was late 2004, {{and the band}} had to delay the album to January 2005. But as the new target date was approaching, the band again {{discarded}} songs, which they deemed [...] "flat" [...] and [...] "passionless". Sixty songs were written during these sessions, fifty-two of which were ditched. The band started rehearsing the songs for a planned tour, but felt the songs sounded better live compared to their recorded versions: [...] "We realized that we didn't really have the right songs {{and some of them}} were starting to sound better because we were playing them than they did on record, so we thought we <b>better</b> <b>go</b> back and record them again." [...] Guitarist Jonny Buckland has said that the band had pushed themselves [...] "forward in every direction" [...] in making the album, but they felt it sounded like they were going backwards compared to their earlier works.|$|E
500|$|... "Battlefield" [...] is a mid-tempo pop and R ballad. It also {{derives from}} the genres of pop rock and soft rock. The {{instrumentation}} of [...] "Battlefield" [...] consists of a bass, piano, drums, percussion and guitar. [...] "Battlefield" [...] is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 144 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major with Sparks' vocal range spanning from the note of A3 to C6. The song's lyrics revolve around [...] "a tumultuous relationship where neither side wants to compromise", as stated by Jocelyn Vena of MTV News. Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Battlefield" [...] {{is based on the}} [...] "love is war" [...] metaphor. During the chorus, Sparks sings: [...] "I never meant to start a war / You know, I never wanna hurt you / Don't even know what we're fighting for / Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield." [...] Its bridge features the line: [...] "I guess you'd <b>better</b> <b>go</b> and get your armour".|$|E

500|$|Alberta's women, {{especially}} those of the UFA-affiliated United Farm Women of Alberta, were active in the province's moral reform movement. [...] They were also active in seeking the vote: in 1913 a delegation of them arrived at the legislature demanding the vote; Sifton asked them [...] "did you ladies wash up your luncheon dishes before you came down here to ask me for the vote? [...] If you haven't you'd <b>better</b> <b>go</b> home because you're {{not going to get}} any votes from me." [...] In October 1914 another delegation arrived, bearing the signatures of 40,000 people. [...] At that time, the Premier agreed that most traditional objections to extension of the franchise were [...] "played out", but expressed concern at the increases that would result to the cost of elections and uncertainty at whether most of the province's women actually wanted suffrage. [...] In February 1915 a larger delegation arrived at the legislature and occupied the MLAs' seats, demanding that the franchise be extended quickly enough to allow women to vote in the upcoming prohibition referendum; an angry Sifton refused and suggested to the women that if they wanted the vote, they should contact their MLAs and promise that they would use their votes to re-elect them, [...] "which is after all one of the strongest way in which you can appeal to male human nature, as represented in the legislature." [...] Even so, he committed to raising the issue in the legislature after the referendum. [...] On September 17, 1915, he told UFA President James Speakman that he had given instructions for the preparation of a statute [...] "placing men and women in Alberta on the basis of absolute equality so far as Provincial matters are concerned." [...] True to his word, he introduced legislation in the spring of 1916 giving women the vote in all provincial and municipal elections. [...] The Conservatives supported it enthusiastically, and only St. Albert MLA Lucien Boudreau voted against it (though Ribstone Liberal James Gray Turgeon admitted that he was supporting his leader's legislation against his own convictions).|$|E

2500|$|A brilliancy-prize {{game from}} the 1953 Candidates event versus the Soviet {{grandmaster}} Mark Taimanov. Najdorf's enthusiasm for, and virtuosity in conducting, the {{attack against the}} enemy king is well shown here, in a game praised by David Bronstein in his famous book on the tournament. It {{is also a good}} example of learning from one's defeats. Earlier that year, Gligorić had beaten Najdorf with the same system. (...)

All artillery and munitions were sent to Vicksburg. Lovell then sent a last message to the War Department in Richmond, “The enemy has passed the forts. It is too late to send any guns here; they had <b>better</b> <b>go</b> to Vicksburg.” Military stores, ships, and warehouses were then burned. Anything considered useful to the Union, including thousands of bales of cotton, were thrown into the river.|$|E

The EP included the tracks [...] "Ice" [...] and [...] "Amoxycillin" [...] and debuted at No. 1 on the Australian alternative music chart. It remained on that chart for 75 weeks, eventually selling 20,000 copies. Life Was <b>Better</b> <b>went</b> on to receive four nominations at the ARIA Music Awards of 1995.|$|R

In July 1922, Blanding was praised in the press for his [...] "manly qualities in makeup" [...] after he asked the Cleveland team president Somers {{to allow him to}} return to the minor leagues. Blanding told Somers that [...] "he felt that he was not giving value received for his salary and that in justice to the team he thought he had <b>better</b> <b>go</b> back to a minor league." [...] Somers declined the offer, told Blanding to put the defeats behind him and expressed confidence that Blanding would [...] "shake off his hoo-doo." ...|$|E

[...] Hardoff notes that by the terms of the Medicine Lodge Treaty, the Cheyenne-Arapaho reservation had the Arkansas River as its northern boundary. In April 1868, the U.S. Army distributed food provisions due the Cheyennes and Arapahoes at Fort Larned and Fort Dodge, both north of the Arkansas. Further, on August 9, 1868, they had distributed treaty annuities in the form of arms and ammunition at Fort Larned rather than south of the Arkansas.|$|E

[...] Made from eight sections of the Berlin Wall, [...] "Breakthrough" [...] not only serves to commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall, but also to memorialize Churchill's [...] "Sinews of Peace." [...] "I had always wanted to make a sculpture for the Churchill Memorial at Westminster," [...] Sandys said, [...] "and this seemed the perfect moment to do something. [...] Friends in Berlin had come back with tiny little pieces of wall, and I thought, ‘Wouldn't it be great to make a sculpture.’ [...] I thought I'd <b>better</b> <b>go</b> straight [...] while there was some wall left." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Brando made one of the strongest commitments to furthering King's work. Shortly after King's death, he announced that he was bowing out of the lead role of a major film (The Arrangement) (1969) which was about to begin production in order to devote himself to the civil rights movement. [...] "I felt I'd <b>better</b> <b>go</b> find out where it is; {{what it is to be}} black in this country; what this rage is all about," [...] Brando said on the late-night ABC-TV talk show Joey Bishop Show. In A's Biography episode on Brando, actor and co-star Martin Sheen states, [...] "I'll never forget the night that Reverend King was shot and I turned on the news and Marlon was walking through Harlem with Mayor Lindsay. And there were snipers and there was a lot of unrest and he kept walking and talking through those neighborhoods with Mayor Lindsay. It was one of the most incredible acts of courage I ever saw, and it meant a lot and did a lot." ...|$|E
2500|$|United {{won their}} fourth league title in five seasons {{at the end}} of the 1996–97 campaign, made easier by the fact that their rivals were [...] "not up to the job". Under Ferguson, the team made a <b>better</b> <b>go</b> in the Champions League and reached the semi-final stage for the first time in 28 years. United did not advance any further, after defeat by Borussia Dortmund of Germany. Norwegian signings Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Ronny Johnsen were the notable {{additions}} to the squad, with the former ending the season as the club's top goalscorer. In May 1997, Cantona informed Ferguson his decision to retire from football. The player [...] "felt exploited by United's merchandising department" [...] and questioned the ambition of the club, reasons which Ferguson understood. Striker Teddy Sheringham was signed as Cantona's replacement from Tottenham Hotspur, with Blackburn defender Henning Berg the other significant purchase that summer. In the close season, United appointed Keane as their new captain. Ferguson described him as [...] "the best all-round player in the game" [...] after the team's 1997 FA Charity Shield win and believed Keane had [...] "all the right ingredients" [...] to succeed from Cantona.|$|E
