40|$|Abstract. The {{stabilization}} of Hochschild homology of commutative algebras is Gamma homology. We describe a cyclic variant of Gamma homology and {{prove that the}} associated analogue of Connes ’ periodicity sequence becomes almost trivial, because the cyclic version coincides with the ordinary version from homological degree two on. We offer an alternative explanation for this by proving that the <b>B-operator</b> followed by the stabilization map is trivial from degree one on. 1...|$|E
40|$|For every {{connected}} manifold with corners {{we use a}} homology theory called conormal homology, {{defined in}} terms of faces and incidences and whose cycles correspond geometrically to corner's cycles. Its Euler characteristic (over the rationals, dimension of the total even space minus the dimension of the total odd space), χ_cn:=χ_ 0 -χ_ 1, is given by the alternated sum of the number of (open) faces of a given codimension. The main result of the present paper is that for a compact connected manifold with corners X given as a finite product of manifolds with corners of codimension less or equal to three we have that 1) If X satisfies the Fredholm Perturbation property (every elliptic pseudodifferential <b>b-operator</b> on X can be perturbed by a b-regularizing operator so it becomes Fredholm) then the even Euler corner character of X vanishes, i. e. χ_ 0 (X) = 0. 2) If the even Periodic conormal homology group vanishes, i. e. H_ 0 ^pcn(X) = 0, then X satisfies the stably homotopic Fredholm Perturbation property (i. e. every elliptic pseudodifferential <b>b-operator</b> on X satisfies the same named property up to stable homotopy among elliptic operators). 3) If H_ 0 ^pcn(X) is torsion free and if the even Euler corner character of X vanishes, i. e. χ_ 0 (X) = 0 then X satisfies the stably homotopic Fredholm Perturbation property. For example for every finite product of manifolds with corners of codimension at most two the conormal homology groups are torsion free. The main theorem behind the above result is the explicit computation in terms of conormal homology of the K-theory groups of the algebra K_b(X) of b-compact operators for X as above. Our computation unifies the only general cases covered before, for codimension zero (smooth manifolds) and for codimension 1 (smooth manifolds with boundary).

Unfortunately the proof of this result is not correct. In this paper, we present a more general sharp L_p-inequalities for B_n-operators which not only provide a correct proof of the above inequality as a special case but also extend them for 0 ≤ p < 1 as well.

40|$|Given an {{associative}} graded algebra {{equipped with}} a degree + 1 differential we define an A-infinity structure that measures {{the failure of the}} differential to be a derivation. This {{can be seen as a}} non-commutative analog of generalized BV-algebras. In that spirit we introduce a notion of associative order for the differential and prove that it satisfies properties similar to the commutative case. In particular when it has associative order 2 the new product is a strictly associative product of degree + 1 and there is a compatibility between the products, similar to ordinary BV-algebras. We consider several examples of structures obtained in this way. In particular we obtain an A-infinity structure on the bar complex of an A-infinity algebra that is strictly associative if the original algebra is strictly associative. We also introduce strictly associative degree + 1 products for any degree + 1 action on a graded algebra. Moreover, an A-infinity structure is constructed on the Hochschild cocomplex of an associative algebra with a non-degenerate inner product by using Connes' <b>B-operator.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 0 figure...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{propagation}} of singularities (in the sense of C^∞ wave front set) of the solution of a model case initial-boundary value problem with glancing rays for a concave domain on an asymptotically anti-de Sitter manifold. The main result addresses the diffractive problem and establishes {{that there is no}} propagation of singularities into the shadow for the solution, i. e. the diffractive result for codimension- 1 smooth boundary holds in this setting. The approach adopted is motivated by the work done for a conformally related diffractive model problem by Friedlander, in which an explicit solution was constructed using the Airy function. This work was later generalized by Melrose and by Taylor, via the method of parametrix construction. Our setting is a simple case of asympotically anti-de Sitter spaces, which are Lorentzian manifolds modeled on anti-de Sitter space at infinity but whose boundary are not totally geodesic (unlike the exact anti-de Sitter space). Most technical difficulties of the problem reduce to studying and constructing a global resolvent for a semiclassical ODE on ^+, which at one end is a <b>b-operator</b> (in the sense of Melrose) while having a scattering behavior at infinity. We use different techniques near 0 and infinity to analyze the local problems: near infinity we use local resolvent bounds and near zero we build a local semiclassical parametrix. After this step, the `gluing' method by Datchev-Vasy serves to combine these local estimates to get the norm bound for the global resolvent...|$|E
