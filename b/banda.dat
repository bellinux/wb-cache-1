OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the use of psychopathology terms {{in the names of}} rock and roll bands and in their songs or musics. METHOD: Psychopathological terms from the DSM-IV glossary were typed in Portuguese and English on the YouTube page. Bands and music of rock and roll were identified.

Sixty bands used psychiatric and neurology related names (44 bands used psychiatry names and 16 neurology). The names predominant in music were related to substance use. When comparing names and songs of Brazilian and other countries bands no difference was found. CONCLUSION: Rock and Roll bands use with greater frequency psychopathology and psychiatric terms in their names and musics. Brazilian bands held similar results...|$|R

5|$|Taonere <b>Banda</b> was {{the first}} Malawian Paralympic athlete to compete at the quadrennial event. She {{qualified}} for the games by using a wildcard because the country {{did not have any}} athletes who met the qualification standards. <b>Banda</b> spent the 60 days in the buildup to Rio training for the event, but amenities in Malawi were imperfect and she trained on a dusty, uneven running track without standard defined lanes. She stated that it had been her childhood ambition to represent Malawi at a major international sporting event and this was her sole opportunity to prove her athletic abilities in her event, the 1500 metres (T13). <b>Banda</b> was drawn in the first heat on 8 September. She attacked the first lap aggressively taking up a commanding lead, but her initial speed saw her tire in the latter stages and she lost the lead in the last 600 metres of the race to finish fourth. <b>Banda</b> was later disqualified when she was observed to leave her lane during the heat. Nevertheless, she said that when she returned to Malawi, she would encourage people with disabilities to work hard and participate in sporting events.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, the Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) {{was formed}} by the Africans of Nyasaland to promote local {{interests}} to the British government. In 1953, Britain linked Nyasaland with Northern and Southern Rhodesia in what was the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, often called the Central African Federation (CAF), for mainly political reasons. Even though the Federation was semi-independent, the linking provoked opposition from African nationalists, and the NAC gained popular support. An influential opponent of the CAF was Dr. Hastings <b>Banda,</b> a European-trained doctor working in Ghana who was persuaded to return to Nyasaland in 1958 to assist the nationalist cause. <b>Banda</b> {{was elected president of}} the NAC and worked to mobilise nationalist sentiment before being jailed by colonial authorities in 1959. He was released in 1960 and asked to help draft a new constitution for Nyasaland, with a clause granting Africans the majority in the colony's Legislative Council.|$|E
