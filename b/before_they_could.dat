5|$|Amrullah Saleh {{has been}} {{speaking}} and writing extensively {{on these issues}} in both local and international media. He maintains that the Taliban need to disarm and honor {{the integrity of the}} Afghan constitution <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be considered for any reconciliation process.|$|E
5|$|Award of {{the medal}} was {{approved}} for twenty-three men, three of whom died <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> receive this award. Of the twenty recipients, three were holders {{of both the}} Marine Corps Brevet Medal and the Medal of Honor.|$|E

2500|$|A figure {{strode to}} the fissure, no more than man-high yet terror seemed to go <b>before</b> it. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> see the furnace-fire of its eyes from afar; its arms were very long; it had a red [...]|$|R
60|$|They {{said that}} the misery of this shave had gone so far beyond any thing they had ever {{experienced}} <b>before,</b> that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not bear the idea of losing such a chance of hearing a cordial opinion from me on the subject.|$|R
5|$|The Schwere Heeres Panzer Abteilung 501 (s.H.Pz.Abt. 501) {{arrived on}} the Eastern Front with only eight out of 45 tanks operational; these faults were mostly due to {{drive-train}} failures. The first five Tiger IIs delivered to the Panzer Lehr Division broke down <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be used in combat, and were destroyed to prevent capture.|$|E
5|$|Although Duke Andrew {{made every}} effort to capture Queen Constance and King Ladislaus <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> escape, they were able to reach Vienna, Austria. Duke Leopold VI, who was King Emeric's and Duke Andrew's cousin, was willing to give shelter to King Ladislaus, {{although}} Duke Andrew threatened him with an invasion. Ladislaus abruptly died on 7 May 1205. His body was carried to Székesfehérvár, and buried in the Székesfehérvár Basilica.|$|E
5|$|At first, the Japanese bombers {{appeared}} {{to be trying to}} approach and attack Enterprise but turned toward Chicago after six Enterprise CAP fighters began to engage them. Four other CAP fighters chased the 751AG aircraft as they entered the anti-aircraft fire from Chicagos escorting destroyers. Two of the bombers were shot down <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> release their ordnance. Six more were shot down moments later, but not before they dropped their torpedoes.|$|E
60|$|They slowed their pace to a {{stealthy}} walk. Behind {{them and}} beside them was chilly darkness lurking in caverns among black, bare tree-trunks. <b>Before</b> them <b>they</b> <b>could</b> see a nebulous glow {{and hear the}} monotonous voice singing the same words over and over.|$|R
6000|$|... "However, {{it tells}} both ways. I have over forty men here. They have, of course, friends among the porters and others {{working on the}} wharves; and a {{disturbance}} might take place, were I arrested. However, the scoundrels have now got such absolute power that, no doubt, they feel that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> disregard any local rising and, indeed, with the plunder of my store <b>before</b> them, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> reckon on the devotion of {{the greater part of}} the mob of the town." ...|$|R
50|$|In Season 1, Episode 3, {{during the}} search for The Holy Lance, the team claims to have gone to Area 51 <b>before</b> {{deciding}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not gain entry and ultimately abandoning the search. However, it has been {{pointed out that the}} unoccupied guard house that Ashley and Kinga are filmed in front of is not the entrance to Area 51 and that they, in fact, fabricated the shot from another location.|$|R
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{invade the}} Song, the Jurchens reached a peace {{agreement}} with their western neighbors the Tangut Western Xia in 1124. The following year near the Ordos Desert, they captured Tianzuo, the last emperor of the Liao, {{putting an end to}} the Liao dynasty for good. Ready to end their alliance with the Song, the Jurchens began preparations for an invasion.|$|E
5|$|Between March 24 and 25, the VPA 3rd (324th Division) and 101st Regiments {{continued}} their drive towards Huế, after they successfully captured Phu Bai Air Base. At the same time, the 1st Regiment (324th Division) {{along with the}} Viet Cong 4th and 271st Regiments were able to destroy the last elements of the ARVN 147th Marines Brigade and the 15th Ranger Group, <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> board navy vessels anchored off the shores of Huong Thuy, Luong Thien and Ke Sung and Cu Lai.|$|E
5|$|In 1781, Virginia Governor Thomas Jefferson {{promoted}} Clark to {{brigadier general}} {{and gave him}} command of all the militia in the Kentucky and Illinois counties. As Clark prepared to lead another expedition against the British at their allies in Detroit, General Washington transferred {{a small group of}} regulars to assist, but the detachment was disastrously defeated in August 1781 <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> meet up with Clark, ending the campaign.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnetic}} compass existed in China {{back as far}} as the fourth century BC. It was used as much for feng shui as for navigation on land. It was not until good steel needles could be forged that compasses were used for navigation at sea; <b>before</b> that, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not retain their magnetism long enough to be useful. The first mention of a compass in Europe was in 1190 AD.|$|R
60|$|For {{the moment}} it must be confessed that Ben was {{absolutely}} dumfounded, and Major Morris also. They had fully expected to see {{a woman in the}} hands of the regulars <b>before</b> them, and <b>they</b> <b>could</b> scarcely believe the evidence of their own senses.|$|R
6000|$|With {{that they}} had to go. This was still worse than <b>before,</b> <b>they</b> thought. Where <b>could</b> <b>they</b> get such a marvellous boar? They all went about hanging their heads; but when only one day {{remained}} of the three Esben came along. When he saw his brothers' sorrowful looks he cried, 'Hallo, what's the matter now?' ...|$|R
5|$|It wasn't until 2008 that Gygax {{was able}} to finish the second volume of six volumes, Castle Zagyg: The Upper Works, which {{described}} details of the castle above ground. The next two volumes were supposed to detail the dungeons beneath Castle Zagyg. However, <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be written, Gygax died in March 2008. Three months after his death, Gygax Games – a new company formed by Gary's widow, Gail – withdrew all of the Gygax licenses from Troll Lord, and also from Hekaforge.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish {{commander}} Sulzbach made {{a tactical}} error in not attacking either Schack or Eberstein <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> join up, {{even though his}} generals urged him to do so. Instead, he chose to withdraw to Nyborg. The Swedish king was not pleased and immediately sent Gustaf Otto Stenbock to relieve Sulzback of his command. When Stenbock arrived he found the city's defenses wanting and sent a note to the king {{that he could not}} guarantee that he would hold the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{withdrawal}} plan formulated by General Phạm Văn Phú and his General Staff {{was made with}} the belief that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces would stop and consolidate their territorial gains <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> go on the attack again. However, during the spring offensive of 1975, North Vietnamese commanders were more than willing to maneuver their units away from newly captured territories, in order to pursue retreating South Vietnamese units.|$|E
60|$|These tactics were {{faithfully}} carried out. All day the Spaniards followed, as they believed, close {{upon the}} footsteps of the flying foe; but from time to time, from strong advantage spots, arrows were rained upon them, great rocks thundered down, and wild yells rang through the forest. <b>Before,</b> however, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> ascend the slopes and get hand to hand with their enemy, these had retreated, and all was silent as the grave in the woods.|$|R
60|$|Despite his sufferings poor Wilkins rejoiced {{that night}} with his comrades at their good fortune, and it was long <b>before</b> he or <b>they</b> <b>could</b> cease to talk over future plans and take needful rest. At length Buckley rolled himself in his blanket, and lay down.|$|R
5000|$|Sometime {{after the}} Extremis transformation, during {{an attack by}} the new Super-Adaptoid, Stark {{realized}} he could command several armors at once. Building on this, and realizing the world was becoming an increasingly dangerous place, he decided to construct a [...] "team" [...] of Iron Men—hyper-advanced drones that would be under his direct mental command, just as his own armored body. Unfortunately, the [...] "Argonauts" [...] were abused and destroyed <b>before</b> <b>they</b> ever <b>could</b> serve for good. They included: ...|$|R
5|$|Twilight confronts Discord, {{accusing him}} of {{cheating}} since he destroyed the labyrinth <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{get to the end}} of the game. However, Discord counters this by reminding her that, while he had hinted at where the Elements were, he never said anything about them being in the labyrinth. As he disappears and teases the ponies with another storm of chocolate rain, Twilight realizes that a line from Discord's riddle actually refers to Ponyville itself.|$|E
5|$|Universo 2000 {{holds the}} record for the most reigns at three. His second reign is the longest in the title's history at 1,225 days, and he also holds {{the record for}} the longest {{combined}} reign with 2,555 days. Konnan, who was the inaugural champion, holds {{the record for the}} shortest reign at 70 days. Three champions never had a successful title defense: both Garza and Steel left CMLL <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> defend the championship, and Konnan lost the championship in his first defense.|$|E
5|$|When Macpherson's {{squadron}} {{reached the}} high ground an Ottoman patrol saw the light horsemen, but <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> alert the Tiberias garrison, they was quickly cut off and captured. By the time a squadron of the 12th Light Horse Regiment advancing from Semakh, reached the outskirts of Tiberias at 11:30, all approaches were held by squadrons of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnetic}} compass existed in China {{back as far}} as the fourth century BC. It was used as much for feng shui as for navigation on land. It was not until good steel needles could be forged that compasses were used for navigation at sea; <b>before</b> that, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not retain their magnetism for long. The existence of magnetic declination, the difference between magnetic north and true north, was first recognized by Shen Kuo in 1088.|$|R
50|$|Panelists had {{the option}} of passing to the next panelist—or even disqualifying {{themselves}} entirely if they somehow knew the contestant's occupation <b>before</b> the round. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> also request a conference, in which they had a short time for open discussion of ideas about occupations or lines of questioning.|$|R
6000|$|Public-school ethics do {{not demand}} {{that you should}} reply truthfully {{to the spirit of}} a question. The letter of it is all that {{requires}} attention. Dunstable had looked at the lesson. He was looking at it then. Masters should practise exactness of speech. A certain form at Harrow were in the habit of walking across a copy of a Latin author <b>before</b> morning-school. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> then say with truth that they [...] "had been over it." [...] This is not an isolated case.|$|R
5|$|A {{recommendation}} from Burstall helped Baxter secure a research engineer position with Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in Billingham, where a new chemical factory {{had been established}} to make sodium hydroxide. Here he met Lilian May Thatcher, {{who worked as a}} stenographer in nearby Stockton-on-Tees. The two became engaged, but <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> marry, Alexander Fleck had Baxter transferred to ICI's new General Chemicals Division in Widnes as head of the Central Laboratory. Baxter and Lilian were married in the register office in Stockton-on-Tees on 17 August 1931. Three years later they designed and built their own home in Farnworth, where they lived until 1949. They had four children: a daughter, Valerie; an adopted son, Peter; and sons Dennis and Roderick.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} surprisingly fast {{from the}} sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. The First Samnite War from 343 BC to 341 BC was relatively short: the Romans defeated the Samnites in two battles, but {{were forced to}} withdraw <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War. Rome defeated the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius {{and again in the}} Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards {{came the}} Bataan Death March, {{which was the}} forcible transfer, by the Imperial Japanese Army, of 60,000 Filipino and 15,000 American prisoners of war after the three-month Battle of Bataan in the Philippines during World War II. The death toll of the march is {{difficult}} to assess as thousands of captives were able to escape from their guards (although many were killed during their escapes), {{and it is not}} known how many died in the fighting that was taking place concurrently. All told, approximately 2,500–10,000 Filipino and 300–650 American prisoners of war died <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> reach Camp O'Donnell.|$|E
6000|$|Thus {{the whole}} fleet passed {{steadily}} to windward, the object being {{to get to}} such {{a position on the}} [...] "fishing-grounds" [...] <b>before</b> night-fall, that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> put about and sail before the wind during the night, dragging their ponderous trawls over the banks where fish were known to lie.|$|R
50|$|The TWHBEA {{was founded}} in 1935 in Lewisburg, Tennessee {{for the purpose of}} {{registering}} Tennessee Walking Horses and maintaining their bloodlines. The association was originally named the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' Association of America, but was renamed in 1974 to cover the popular show industry. The TWHBEA closed the studbook in 1947, meaning that after that date horses were required to have two registered parents <b>before</b> <b>they</b> themselves <b>could</b> be registered. As of 2017, the TWHBEA has registered more than 520,000 horses, and has approximately 19,000 members.|$|R
50|$|In the peloton Louison Bobet en Jacques Anquetil {{were leading}} the chase. <b>Before</b> Anzegem <b>they</b> <b>could</b> catch the two leaders. Attack of Fred De Bruyne. Rik Van Steenbergen didn't react, but Bobet did. There {{was a new}} leading group: the Frenchman Bobet and the Belgian De Bruyne. Because Bobet was a faster {{sprinter}} and would win from De Bruyne, there was a reaction of Van Steenbergen. Together with Van Looy, Jacques Anquetil and André Darrigade he could close the gap. A group of six rides could sprint for the victory.|$|R
