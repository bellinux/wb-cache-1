5|$|Among ectoparasites, bats carry fleas and mites, {{as well as}} {{specific}} parasites such as bat <b>bugs</b> <b>and</b> bat flies (Nycteribiidae and Streblidae). However, {{they are one of}} the few non-aquatic mammalian orders that do not host lice. This may be due to competition from more effective, specialized parasites which occupy the same niche.|$|E
5|$|Despite its age, Worms Armageddon still {{receives}} periodic updates, {{mainly from}} two programmers known as Deadcode and CyberShadow, recruited by Team17. These updates address <b>bugs</b> <b>and</b> compatibility issues, and also add new features to the game, such as {{support for a}} greater number of worms in a match and support for arbitrarily-sized colour levels. The latest update was on 19 March 2013.|$|E

5|$|Producer Algy Williams hired {{a team of}} {{multimedia}} artists and programmers to help Horse develop Drowned God. Upon its release, the game sold well, but it quickly faded in popularity due to <b>bugs</b> <b>and</b> a lack of patches. Drowned Gods concept and visuals were widely praised, while its gameplay, audio, and puzzles received more varied responses. A planned sequel never came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the {{algorithms}} meant that some calculations, such as arccos0.2, could take up to 15 seconds, whereas the HP-35 was designed to complete calculations in under a second. Accuracy in scientific functions was also limited to around three digits at most, {{and there were a}} number of <b>bugs</b> <b>and</b> limitations.|$|E
5|$|This swift is host {{to feather}} mites {{including}} Eustathia cultrifera, Chauliacia canarisi and C. securigera. Biting parasites include the louse fly Crataerina pacifica, bat <b>bugs</b> <b>and</b> sucking mites. Chewing lice include two species first identified on this swift. Davaineidae tapeworms {{have been found}} as internal parasites.|$|E

40|$|As {{fields are}} being scouted for second-generation bean leaf beetles, stink bugs are being found in greater {{abundance}} than usual during late summer. These stink bugs {{are unlikely to}} cause any economic damage (i. e., damage that would justify an insecticide application). There are three species of stink bugs that are fairly common in Iowa soybean: the green stink bug, brown stink <b>bug,</b> <b>and</b> spined soldier <b>bug.</b> The green stink <b>bug</b> <b>and</b> brown stink <b>bug</b> are both pests and can damage pods. See the August 20, 2001, ICM article on page 121 {{for information on the}} green stink <b>bug</b> <b>and</b> damage to soybean...|$|R
5|$|Among {{the types}} of insects {{consumed}} are many families of beetles, wasps and ants, flies (families Tabanidae and Asilidae), <b>bugs,</b> <b>and</b> caterpillars. Other invertebrates eaten include spiders, millipedes and earthworms. The flame robin consumes small prey items whole, and bashes larger victims against a hard surface repeatedly to break up before eating. The latter group constitute only 0.5% of prey over time—seasonally varying {{from a peak of}} 1.8% in autumn to a low of 0.2% of prey caught in winter.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{agreed that}} the game's {{graphics}} were good, enjoyed Uematsu's score, and several praised the concepts behind the Job and leveling systems. Alongside this, unanimous criticism was laid against the gameplay pace, its convoluted interface, <b>bugs</b> <b>and</b> glitches, and {{the slow pace of}} the story. It was generally seen as a great disappointment both as an MMORPG and a mainline entry in the Final Fantasy series. Later, as part of an interview concerning the game's later development, 1UP.com commented that subsequent patches and overhauls had turned the game into something more playable.|$|E
5|$|Europa Barbarorum {{was first}} {{released}} to the public as an open beta in December 2005. After several more minor releases throughout 2006 which mostly fixed <b>bugs</b> <b>and</b> made small adjustments to the modification, the next major release of Europa Barbarorum was version 0.80 in December 2006. Its changes included the addition of the Sabaean faction, new music, and the inclusion of a new military–industrial complex system. There were three more 0.8-series releases {{during the first half of}} 2007 which primarily made minor adjustments to the modification and fixed bugs. In total, over 135,000 downloads of the 0.80–0.81 versions were tracked.|$|E

5|$|Frog Fractions is a 2012 browser game {{developed}} by Twinbeard Studios, a company composed primarily of founder Jim Crawford. The game, released on October 25, 2012, {{has been described}} as a spoof of the edutainment game genre. In the game, the player begins by controlling a frog to eat <b>bugs</b> <b>and</b> defend fruit. Later on, the player may spend points on upgrades to improve their frog's abilities. The game does not actually teach the player about fractions; the player's score is given in fractions, but no knowledge of them is necessary to play.|$|E
5|$|Game critics praised Giants for {{state-of-the-art}} graphics, humorous story, {{and success}} in blending in one genre with another. Criticisms of the game centered on crippling software <b>bugs</b> <b>and</b> lack of an in-game save feature. The console version rectified some of the flaws found in the PC versions, {{at the cost of}} removing several features. Giants sold poorly initially for both Windows and PlayStation2; however, it sold well afterwards and the game has gained a cult following.|$|E
5|$|Green-head ants are prey for {{a number}} of predators, {{including}} assassin <b>bugs</b> <b>and</b> the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), in the faeces of which have been found worker ants. Birds also eat these ants, including the Australian white ibis (Threskiornis moluccus), black kite (Milvus migrans), masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) and the Australian owlet-nightjar (Aegotheles cristatus). Workers and larvae can be infected by parasites; examined workers were seen with late-stage pupae of an unidentified parasite in their thoraces. In some nests of the green-head ant, some myrmecophilous insects such as the beetle Chlamydopsis longipes are sometimes seen living inside colonies.|$|E

5|$|On December 9, 2010, Symantec {{released}} the 18.5 version through Norton LiveUpdate. However, this update was later pulled due to numerous {{reports on the}} Norton forums that the update is causing system instability and freeze ups during system scans (both full and quick scans). This issue only affects some customers. Users affected by this update are advised to uninstall the product, run the Norton Removal Tool, and reinstall the 18.1 version from http://www.norton.com/nis11. Symantec later fixed the <b>bugs</b> <b>and</b> re-{{released the}} update.|$|E
5|$|Other {{issues with}} regards to crashes, {{temporary}} freezes and long load times were found on single core computers, but these were ultimately addressed in a patch. A second patch, which reduced the amount mining time required to acquire upgrades, fixed some saved game loading issues, and addressed other minor bugs, was also released. On PlayStation 3, a concerning number of players reported that their save files can become corrupted if the game crashes unexpectedly. After community chief Chris Priestly of BioWare asked affected players to provide details about the issue, BioWare released a PlayStation 3 patch designed to combat save <b>bugs</b> <b>and</b> crashes experienced.|$|E
5|$|Prevention mostly {{involves}} eliminating kissing <b>bugs</b> <b>and</b> avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood {{used for}} transfusions. A vaccine {{has not been}} developed as of 2017. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of end–stage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox cause temporary side effects in up to 40% of people including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.|$|E

5|$|Radishes can {{be useful}} as {{companion}} plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash <b>bugs,</b> <b>and</b> ants. They can function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the main crop. Cucumbers and radishes seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums. However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.|$|E
5|$|Reach was {{announced}} at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009 in Los Angeles, California, and the first in-engine trailer was shown at the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards. Players who purchased ODST were eligible {{to participate in a}} Reach multiplayer beta in May 2010; the beta allowed Bungie to gain player feedback for fixing <b>bugs</b> <b>and</b> making gameplay tweaks before shipping the final version. Microsoft gave Reach its biggest game marketing budget yet and created award-winning live-action commercials, action figures, and interactive media to promote the game.|$|E
5|$|Reachs {{multiplayer}} beta {{was open}} to owners of Halo 3: ODST. More than threemillion copies of ODST were sold by November 2009. Bungie estimated between two and three million players for the upcoming Reach beta, compared to the 800,000 that participated in Halo 3s trial. Development schedules forced Bungie to release a six-week-old beta, fraught with <b>bugs</b> <b>and</b> issues already addressed in newer builds. Though concerned that these issues might tarnish the game's image, Jarrard noted that they {{had little choice but}} to ship it as it was and communicate with players concerning the fixes.|$|E
