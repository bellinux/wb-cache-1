50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of esophageal perforation {{could also be}} confirmed by water-soluble contrast esophagram (Gastrograffin), which reveals the location and extent of extravasation of contrast material. Although barium is superior in demonstrating small perforations, the spillage of barium sulfate into the mediastinal and pleural cavities can cause an inflammatory response and subsequent fibrosis and is therefore not used as the primary diagnostic study. If, however, the water-soluble study is negative, a <b>barium</b> <b>study</b> should be performed for better definition.|$|E
40|$|Background/Objective: Hypertrophic pyloric {{stenosis}} (HPS) is the commonest {{indication of}} pediatric surgery in neonatal period and early infancy. There are some clinical and radiological methods for {{the diagnosis of}} HPS. As an example, a positive "olive sign" in the abdominal examination is diagnostic; however, it seems that performing physical examination {{for the detection of}} this sign has been abandoned and that this practice has been replaced by sonography and other paraclinical tests. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the ability of our physicians in finding the palpable olive in clinical examination and the accuracy of sonography and the true positive rate of <b>barium</b> <b>study.</b> "nPatients and Methods: We evaluated 84 patients admitted to our hospital during a 7 -year period in which the final surgical report was HPS. Clinical examination for the right upper quadrant (RUQ) olive like mass, <b>barium</b> <b>study</b> and ultrasound findings of HPS were evaluated. Pediatric residents (junior and senior residents) examined all these cases. Twenty-one patients had a <b>barium</b> <b>study</b> and 81 had a sonography, which was performed by an attending radiologist. Data were evaluated for the diagnostic yield (DY) of all these diagnostic tools. "nResults: The mean age of the patients was 36. 1 days on admission and the male/female ratio was 5. 4 / 1. All the patients had a clinical examination, in which the olive sign was detected in only 13 cases (DY= 15. 5 %, 95 % CI: 12 %- 19 %); 81 patients had a sonography, in 71 of whom HPS was detected (DY = 87. 7 %, 95 % CI: 85 %- 92 %); <b>barium</b> <b>study</b> revealed HPS in 16 of 21 patients (DY = 76. 2 %, 95 % CI: 71. 4 %- 82 %). "nConclusion: Sonography was more precise than clinical examination and <b>barium</b> <b>study</b> in detecting HPS. Due to the crying baby and the distended stomach, less time is spent for clinical examination. Therefore, paraclinical studies such as imaging become the first step in diagnosis and are requested earlier and even as the first diagnostic study on admission. This leads to reduction of doctors' experience in finding the olive sign...|$|E

Certain parasites are seen as filling defects outlined by Barium and Barium examinations {{play an important role}} in the diagnosis of intestinal infections and infestations as compared to other techniques. <b>Barium</b> <b>studies</b> show tapeworms and roundworms as thin, linear filling defects of the bowel. Because roundworms have a developed alimentary tract, barium may outline the parasites’ intestinal tracts on delayed images. In Strongyloidiasis <b>barium</b> <b>studies</b> show intestinal wall oedema, thickening of intestinal folds with flattening, and atrophy of the overlying mucosa. Schistosomiasis caused by infection with flatworms [...] have an appearance resembling colitis ulcerosa, with inflammatory polyps, ulcers, fibrosis, wall thickening, loss of haustration, and stenosis in Barium X-rays. Anisakiasis is demonstrated by Barium X-rays as bowel wall oedema, thickening, ulceration, or stricture due to inflammation. Sometimes worms are seen as long, thread-like, linear filling defects up to 30cm long. In Typhlitis <b>Barium</b> <b>studies</b> show oedema, ulceration, and inflammation of bowel wall resulting in wall thickening.

40|$|Congenital {{duodenal}} obstruction commonly occurs due to malrotation, atresia, stenosis and annular pancreas in decreasing {{order of}} frequency. This {{is a case}} report of a 12 year old male child who presented with complaints of non-projectile vomiting and abdominal distension and pain after meals since 7 years. <b>Barium</b> <b>study</b> showed narrowing of the Duodeno-jejunal(DJ) junction due to hypertrophied ligament of Treitz.

Congenital obstruction of duodeno-jejunal junction due to extrinsic band or due to narrower attachment of ligament of Treitz at duodeno-jejunal flexure is a rare cause of bilious vomiting in the newborn period. A broad attachment of the ligament of Treitz makes a smooth obtuse angle at the duodeno-jejunum junction whereas a narrower insertion creates an acute angle that predisposes to obstruction.
