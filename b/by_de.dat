5|$|As well as {{encouraging}} his nephew's career, de Gray {{took into}} his household two of Hubert Walter's household clerks: David, and Robert of Ruddeby.

50|$|This {{situation}} {{began to}} change when Franciscan missioners arrived from Spain in order to evangelize the Indians. The Franciscans are the responsibles of the establishment of many missions which became in towns later.

5|$|Speed2: Cruise Control is a 1997 American {{disaster}} thriller film, and {{a sequel}} to Speed (1994).

5|$|The de Havilland DH 106 Comet was the world's first {{commercial}} jetliner. Developed and manufactured <b>by</b> <b>de</b> Havilland at its Hatfield Aerodrome, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom headquarters, the Comet1 prototype first flew on 27 July 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four de Havilland Ghost turbojet engines {{buried in the}} wings, a pressurised fuselage, and large square windows. For the era, it offered a relatively quiet, comfortable passenger cabin and showed signs of being a commercial success at its 1952 debut.|$|E

The ditch had been {{excavated}} by 1732, while the chapel, barracks, magazines and countermines were completed in around 1733. The fort {{was an active}} military establishment by 1734.

5|$|The {{shooting}} {{down of the}} plane served as the catalyst for the Rwandan genocide, which began within a few hours. An interim government took over, headed <b>by</b> <b>de</b> facto-leader Colonel Théoneste Bagosora, which began ordering the systematic killing of huge numbers of Tutsi, {{as well as some}} politically moderate Hutu, through well-planned attacks. Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 were killed.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} other related unequivalent tilings, {{such as the}} hexagon-boat-star and MikullaRoth tilings. For instance, if the {{matching}} rules for the rhombus tiling are reduced to a specific restriction on the angles permitted at each vertex, a binary tiling is obtained. Its underlying symmetry is also fivefold {{but it is not}} a quasicrystal. It can be obtained either by decorating the rhombs of the original tiling with smaller ones, or by applying substitution rules, but not <b>by</b> <b>de</b> Bruijn's cut-and-project method.|$|E

5|$|When Meessen {{returned}} to the Netherlands in 1870 he established a short-lived partnership with Abraham Vermeulen and began disseminating his photographs. Selected images were gifted to King William III in an elaborately decorated album in 1871, while more were published <b>by</b> <b>De</b> Bussy in 1875 and exhibited in Paris and Amsterdam. In his final years Meessen worked predominantly as an architect. Collections of his albumen prints, {{some of which were}} hand-tinted or annotated, are held in four institutions in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Aeronautical {{engineering}} {{firms were}} quick {{to respond to the}} Comet's commercial advantages and technical flaws alike; other aircraft manufacturers learned from, and profited by, the hard-earned lessons embodied <b>by</b> <b>de</b> Havilland's Comet. While the Comet's buried engines were used on some other early jet airliners, such as the Tupolev Tu-104, later aircraft, such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, would differ by employing podded engines held on pylons beneath the wings. Boeing stated that podded engines were selected for their passenger airliners because buried engines carried a higher risk of catastrophic wing failure in the event of engine fire. In response to the Comet tragedies, manufacturers also developed various means of pressurisation testing, often {{going so far as to}} explore rapid depressurisation; subsequent fuselage skins were of a greater thickness than the skin of the Comet.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed <b>by</b> <b>de</b> novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, {{even in the absence}} of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E

5|$|By August, Lucien, his {{children}} and Dermide had all suffered from bouts of fever. Doctors saw no cause for alarm and Lucien quickly recovered, as did {{his children}}. Despite the doctors' best efforts, Dermide died on 14 August, {{at the age of}} six. Pauline later came to believe her son's blood had been thinned by the recurrent spells of yellow fever they had suffered in Saint-Domingue. Borghese decided to conceal Dermide's death from his wife until her health improved. Thus, Francesco returned to Frascati and wrote three letters addressed to Pauline: one which announced the onset of Dermide's illness, the second announcing that the illness worsened and the third announcing Dermide's demise. Immediately after receiving the first letter, Pauline began making preparations for her departure from Pisa, in order to reach her son at Frascati. Before this was possible, she became aware of the truth and her suspicions were confirmed <b>by</b> <b>de</b> la Ronde.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{the budget}} led to {{established}} actors being cast in smaller roles, including Adolfo Celi as the villain Valmont and Michel Piccoli as Ginko. John Philip Law was cast as Diabolik as a favour <b>by</b> <b>De</b> Laurentiis after production on Barbarella, which Law was acting in, was postponed due to technical difficulties. Law was initially unfamiliar with the characters in either Barbarella and Diabolik, and read the comic books to understand the characters. Initially, the role of Eva Kant {{was going to be}} played by an unidentified American model, but she was fired before shooting began.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse {{arrived at}} Cap-Français on 15 August. He {{immediately}} dispatched {{his response to}} Rochambeau's note, which {{was that he would}} make for the Chesapeake. Taking on 3,200 troops, De Grasse sailed from Cap-Français with his entire fleet, 28 ships of the line. Sailing outside the normal shipping lanes to avoid notice, he arrived at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay on August 30, and disembarked the troops to assist in the land blockade of Cornwallis. Two British frigates that were supposed to be on patrol outside the bay were trapped inside the bay <b>by</b> <b>de</b> Grasse's arrival; this prevented the British in New York from learning the full strength of de Grasse's fleet until it was too late.|$|E
