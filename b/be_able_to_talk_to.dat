They arrived on 19 August, {{the day it}} was signed, expecting to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> American scientists, but were unable to do so. Two weeks would pass before American officials learnt of the contents of the Quebec Agreement. Over the next two years, the Combined Policy Committee met only eight times.|$|E
500|$|At {{the police}} station, Mulder tests Bruckman's ability by having him handle various objects {{to see what}} they [...] "tell" [...] him. It becomes {{apparent}} that Bruckman's only real psychic talent is an ability to see details of people's deaths. Scully arrives with a key chain bearing the insignia of an investment company that uses astrology to make financial predictions, taken from the doll collector's body - the same key chain was found on two of the other dead fortunetellers. Bruckman knows that the firm is owned by one Claude Dukenfield, not through a psychic revelation but because he coincidentally sold the man an insurance policy recently. He says that Mulder and Scully will not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Dukenfield though, because he has been murdered.|$|E
500|$|Marc-Antoine Audette {{said that}} it took the duo {{about four or five}} days of calls to Palin's staff to finally <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her. They claimed that they started by talking to {{low-level}} people in Alaska and made their way up through Palin's campaign staff. Audette said that at first they didn't think their prank would work, calling it a [...] "mission impossible". He claimed that [...] "after about a dozen calls", the duo [...] "started to realize it [...] might work, because her [...] staff didn't know the name of the French President. They asked us to spell it." [...] Audette and Trudel credited their ability to make their way up through Palin's staff to sounding convincing during the first few calls, always arranging to place the call at a set time, and not leaving a contact number. The four days of calls needed to talk to Palin was quicker compared to some of their other pranks. Audette and Trudel {{said that it}} took them two months to talk to Paul McCartney and one to talk to Bill Gates, but only two days to prank Britney Spears.|$|E

Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina said [...] "If Hillary Clinton were to face a female nominee, {{there are a whole}} set of things that she won't <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about. She won't <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about being the first woman president. She won't <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about a war on women without being challenged.

500|$|Visiting Andy in the hospital, Ann {{suddenly}} kisses him, but immediately {{stops and}} guiltily walks out. Later, April, also {{relieved to see}} Andy is fine, finally agrees {{to go out with}} him. After they kiss, Andy decides to be honest and tells her about the earlier kiss with Ann. April angrily storms out, taking back her decision to go out with him. That night, Leslie sits on a bench in the empty Lot 48 and Mark joins her, with both appearing happy to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> each other. Mark tells her that if more people like her worked in local government, he wouldn't be leaving, and gives her plans he drew up for a park at Lot 48 before giving her a goodbye kiss on the cheek and walking way forever. The next day, Ron withdraws from the budget task force and appoints Leslie in his place. As Tom (Aziz Ansari) and his new girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) are clearing out his office, he notices Ron is wearing a red shirt and black pants, the [...] "Tiger Woods" [...] outfit he always wears the day after having sex. Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) then appears and kisses Ron and the two leave together, shocking Tom.|$|E

It means women are not intimidated by her looks and guys think they might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her. It's a fantastic combination ... people want to be around her; she's fun on a shoot … and she's not stupid, which can be a very annoying trait among some models.|$|E

2500|$|Marcos wanted Aquino to {{stay out}} of politics, however Aquino {{asserted}} his willingness to suffer the consequences declaring, [...] "the Filipino is worth dying for." [...] He wished to express an earnest plea for Marcos to step down, for a peaceful regime change and a return to democratic institutions. Anticipating the worst, at an interview in his suite at the Taipei Grand Hotel, he revealed that he would be wearing a bullet-proof vest, but he also said that [...] "it's only good for the body, but in the head there's nothing else we can do." [...] Sensing his own doom, he told the journalists accompanying him on the flight, [...] "You have to be very ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast. In a matter of a three or four minutes it could be all over, you know, and [...] I may not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you again after this." [...] His last televised interview, with journalist Jim Laurie, took place on the flight just prior to his assassination.|$|E
