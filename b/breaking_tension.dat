40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} constructing prediction intervals for the time point at which a given number of components of a system exposed to degradation fails. The failure process {{with respect to the}} failure times of the components is modeled by a state dependent point process which is an alternative to the nonhomogeneous Poisson process often used in failure analysis. Several failure processes observed at different usually higher stress conditions are incorporated by a link function. Two new simulation- free prediction intervals are proposed. One is constructed with the method and the implicit function theorem applied to the hypoexponential distribution and does not need the construction of confidence sets for the unknown parameters. The other is based on data depth using a recent result for constructing outlier robust confidence sets for general regression. The two new methods are compared with two methods based on classical confidence sets for generalized linear models. The comparison is done by leave-one-out analysis of data coming from failure processes observed at prestressed concrete beams exposed to different cyclic loading where the time points of <b>breaking</b> <b>tension</b> wires were reported...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Internal hernias occur {{frequently}} after laparoscopic gastric bypass. We {{have found}} no data on the relative strength of the various techniques available for closing these defects. The present study was performed to obtain such data to form a theoretical basis for clinical studies. METHODS: Six piglets were operated laparoscopically and four loops of small bowel created in each. These mesenteric gaps were closed over a distance of 40 mm using (1) running 2 - 0 Ethibond® suture, (2) Endo Hernia stapler, (3) fibrin glue (Tisseel®) and (4) controls, where the mesenteric surfaces were rubbed with a sponge and approximated without further intervention. After 6 weeks, the different segments of the mesentery were excised. The tensile strength was measured using continuously increased traction until the closure ruptured. The ordinary mesentery served as the control. The <b>breaking</b> <b>tension</b> and total amount of energy transferred to the tissue were registered. RESULTS: Control areas with rubbed areas developed no adhesions. Suture and staple lines contracted by 30 % in length, whereas the fibrin glued lines were even shorter. Median tensile strength was greatest for the sutured lines (14, 293 mN) and stapled lines (10, 798 mN). Fibrin glued lines were significantly weaker (6, 780 mN, p = 0. 013 and p = 0. 026), but as strong as ordinary mesentery (4, 165 mN). CONCLUSIONS: If ongoing controlled randomized trials show closure to be beneficial, further studies should include staples {{as one of the}} options for the closure of mesenteric defects. The role of fibrin glue needs to be further investigated...|$|E

40|$|Chitin {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in nature, being the main structural {{component of the}} exoskeleton of crustaceans and is non-toxic, biodegradable and biocompatible. These exoskeletons once discarded become an industrial waste creating environmental pollutant. In order to find an alternative use, the present work exploits the extraction of the chitosan from chitin that {{is present in the}} exoskeletons of shrimps Litopenaeus vannamei and crabs Ucides cordatus and transforms it into high valued products, which can help solving the environmental problem as well to provide extra income to the fishermen. One example is the manufacture of nanomembranes from chitosan for the application in medical textiles. Nanomembranes using electrospinning of chitosan solutions (7 % and 5 wt%) with 100 : 0 v/v (TFA/DCM) and 70 : 30 v/v (TFA/DCM) were produced. Morphological properties of chitin and chitosan were studied using SEM, DRX, and thermal properties through TG/DTG and molecular structure by FTIR analysis. TG/DTG showed thermal decomposition of chitosan samples. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated the semi-crystalline structure of chitosan, and highly crystalline structure for chitin. Morphologies of the nanomembranes were also observed from scanning electron micrographs. Results showed that the nanomembranes with 5 % chitosan solutions with 70 : 30 v/v (TFA/DCM) showed facilitation {{in the formation of the}} nanomembranes. The nanomembranes of shrimp and crab with 5 % 70 : 30 v/v (TFA/DCM) had higher <b>breaking</b> <b>tension</b> and breaking extension. With positive results obtained, the present work will help the authorities to organize the fishermen to have consciousness in the collection of exoskeleton waste as well as helping to have a better environment...|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{was aimed}} at study {{of the effect of}} various gaseous {{extinguishing}} media in an environment of increased temperature on the paper and its properties. Paper samples were exposed to elevated temperature in air, CO 2 gas and gas mixtures of N 2 :Ar (1 : 1). The impact of conditions on the mechanical, chemical and optical properties of paper has been studied after exposure of the paper by extinguishing media under elevated temperature. The change of properties was determined immediately after exposure of samples under simultaneous conditions of fire, further one was determined for samples exposed to conditions of dry and wet aging. As a reference sample was used crude paper. Values of elasticity modulus, strength tensile, tearing resistance, the work needed for <b>break</b> <b>tension,</b> the total color difference and pH of samples have been determined. The results showed that every external influence causes at least some change in mechanical, optical and chemical properties such as increased temperature, the effect of extinguishing media or ageing of paper. The gas mixture N 2 :Ar (1 : 1) had the smallest influence on the sample paper, which was worked. Thus this gas mixture could be the best choice for the application in archive environments...|$|R
