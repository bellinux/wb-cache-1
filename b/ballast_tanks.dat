5|$|The same report {{lists the}} {{following}} as some drawbacks to the double-hull design, including higher build costs, greater operating expenses (e.g. higher canal and port tariffs), difficulties in ballast tank ventilation, {{the fact that}} <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> need continuous monitoring and maintenance, increased transverse free surface, the greater number of surfaces to maintain, the risk of explosions in double-hull spaces if a vapor detection system not fitted, and that cleaning <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> is more difficult for double hull ships.|$|E
5|$|These {{analyses}} are conducted when traveling empty, loading and unloading, when partially and fully loaded, and {{under conditions of}} temporary overloading. Places subject to the largest stresses are studied carefully, such as hold-bottoms, hatch-covers, bulkheads between holds, and the bottoms of <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks.</b> Great Lakes bulkers also must be designed to withstand springing, or developing resonance with the waves, which can cause fatigue fractures.|$|E
5|$|The 1960 SOLAS Convention {{sought to}} control {{this sort of}} problem. These {{regulations}} required the upper <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> designed in a manner to prevent shifting. They also required cargoes to be leveled, or trimmed, using excavators in the holds. The practice of trimming reduces {{the amount of the}} cargo's surface area in contact with air which has a useful side-effect: reducing the chances of spontaneous combustion in cargoes such as coal, iron, and metal shavings.|$|E
50|$|These {{models have}} the ability to alter their {{displacement}} by taking on or pumping out water. This can be accomplished {{through the use of a}} piston, inflatable bladder, or through a <b>ballast</b> <b>tank.</b> Boats that use a <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> generally fill the tank by opening a vent at the top, and force the water out by using compressed gas. There are variants that use water pumps for both processes. A liquid gas is dosed into the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> to push water out. Gas-Snort Liquid gas is used to surface the boat in an emergency, otherwise the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> is blown by the use of a snorkel tube at periscope depth and the boat is trimmed to surface to periscope depth with a full <b>ballast</b> <b>tank.</b> RCABS -Recirculated Compressed Air Ballast System. Originally developed by Darnell (UK) in the 1950s, this system uses a rubber bladder as the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> and this is filled with compressed air supplied by a small compressor. The air is taken from the water-tight container (WTC) aft dry space to inflate the bladder.|$|R
50|$|Another system gaining {{popularity}} is the 'Snort System'. A <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> allows water to enter by releasing a vent valve {{on the top}} of the cylinder, allowing the boat to submerge. To surface, a small pump 'Snorts' air from the snorkel tube in the conning tower (sail) into the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank,</b> expelling the water. This system is also equipped with a small tank of compressed gas, which in the event of a fail-safe system operating, usually due to loss of radio signal, the gas is released into the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank,</b> surfacing the boat.|$|R
40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} for {{the requirement}} {{of the degree of}} Bachelor of Engineering in MechanicalA submarine is a vehicle which travels underneath the sea surface by varying its buoyancy. They are powered by diesel engines, whose drawbacks to a large extent are now overcome by nuclear reactors. It travel into the sea by means of <b>ballast</b> <b>tank,</b> so the design of <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> {{is one of the most}} important aspect. It should be design in such a way that the submarine should submerged by partially filling the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank.</b> In this project, we have designed and developed a density variation mechanism of submarine using air chamber and <b>ballast</b> <b>tank.</b> We use the rolling pump which plays a vital role in this mechanism which helps to suck and discharge water into the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank.</b> This helps the submarine to sink inside the water and float it back to surface. In addition, we also implement the pressure relief valve to overcome the drawback of the excess pressure generated in the air chamber and the navigation system which will help the submarine to take a turn in left and right direction. Surely the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> is an engineering master piece that has proved its purpose and might over the years Submarine is a vehicle which travel underneath sea surface by varying its buoyancy.

5|$|After {{the attack}} on Yokosuka, the Nagatos crew removed all {{casualties}} from the ship and conducted limited repairs. Some of the ship's <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> were also flooded {{to give the impression}} that she had been sunk. During the early hours of 2August Nagato was ordered to put to sea to intercept an Allied force. However, this sortie was canceled before she had completed preparations to leave port as the report of Allied ships was determined to be false. On 30August the ship was surrendered to the U.S.Navy. She was one of the target ships for the two atomic bomb tests conducted at Bikini Atoll on 1 and 28July 1946 during Operation Crossroads, and sank there during the night of 29–30July.|$|E
5|$|Swordfishs diving {{depth and}} time {{are not known}} because the records from her sea trials have not survived. Shutting down her boiler, {{retracting}} the funnel and sealing the boiler uptake required about {{a minute and a}} quarter, which included switching over to the electric motors. In marked contrast to contemporary Vickers designs much attention was paid to safety arrangements, including her extensive subdivision. Indicator and telephone buoys, which could be released from inside the submarine were provided together with external air connections and a charged high-pressure line which could provide air to any manned compartment or the living spaces. Furthermore, the main <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> could be blown from either end of the ship.|$|E
5|$|The USCG cited topside damage as a {{reasonable}} alternative reason for Fitzgerald sinking and surmised that {{damage to the}} fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log. Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something broke loose from Fitzgeralds deck. He theorized {{that the loss of}} the vents resulted in flooding of two <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse let water flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage Fitzgerald experienced at 3:30p.m. on November 10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious explanation for why she sank.|$|E

5|$|On December 9, 2003, the Stellamare, a Dutch-owned ship, capsized at the port, killing three Russian crewmembers. The {{ship was}} hauling General Electric {{generators}} when it overturned. The United States Coast Guard determined that poor communication {{resulting from the}} supervisors speaking Dutch while the crew spoke Russian, with English {{being used as a}} relay, was a contributing factor to mismanagement of <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks.</b> In the early spring of 2008 a port employee was arrested for stealing copper. This in turn led to investigations of employee theft which resulted in the arrest of an operations manager and a maintenance foreman for larceny. In 2008 the port received two awards from the Railway Industrial Clearance Association. One award was for customer satisfaction and the other for being the most improved port in the United States for handling heavy lift cargo.|$|E
5|$|The diving {{environment}} {{is limited by}} accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving {{is done in the}} shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect gear configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team.|$|E
5|$|Before World War II, the {{international}} shipping demand for bulk products was low—about 25million tons for metal ores—and {{most of this}} trade was coastal. However, on the Great Lakes, bulkers hauled vast amounts of ore from the northern mines to the steel mills. In 1929, 73 million tons of iron ore was transported on the Lakes, and an almost equal amount of coal, limestone, and other products were also moved. Two defining characteristics of bulkers were already emerging: the double bottom, which was adopted in 1890, and the triangular structure of the <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks,</b> which was introduced in 1905. After World War II, an international bulk trade began to develop among industrialized nations, particularly between the European countries, the United States and Japan. Due to the economics of this trade, ocean bulkers became larger and more specialized. In this period, Great Lakes freighters increased in size, to maximize economies of scale, and self-unloaders became more common to cut turnaround time. The thousand-footers of the Great Lakes fleets, built in the 1970s, were among the longest ships afloat and in 1979, a record 214 million ton of bulk cargo were moved on the Great Lakes.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{in the late}} 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally {{introduced}} into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate {{a wide range of}} water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels.|$|E

25|$|Loading a {{submarine}} was a lengthy process that took weeks. The {{first step was}} to pump the forward <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> empty which elevated the bow out of the water. Once it was dismantled, the <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> were then filled to lower the bow and flood the well deck to allow the submarine to be winched aboard. The well deck's water-tight doors were then closed and the water in the dock was pumped overboard while the submarine settled onto its wooden bilge blocks. The bow was then reassembled and hatch covers were installed over the well deck. These prevented the ship from taking on water during a storm and allowed the crew to perform any necessary maintenance on the submarine while under way.|$|E
25|$|The salvage of {{a vessel}} that is damaged but still afloat is called afloat salvage.

25|$|It is also {{possible}} for ships to discharge ballast at approved shore reception facilities in ports, as article 5 requires that when cleaning or repair of a ships <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> occurs, ports should have adequate reception facilities for the sediments.

40|$|The ballast sediments deposit {{not only}} provide the {{breeding}} ground for the survival organisms, but also affect the weight balance {{of the ship and}} even accelerate the corrosion of the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank.</b> In this work the performance of a ballast water flushing system for the 138, 000 m 3 LNGC (Liquefied Natural Gas Carrier) double bottom cargo ship is studied.

With different injecting velocities at the flushing inlet, the sediments distribution in the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> is investigated and the energy consumption of the circulating pump is studied. The results show that by flushing the ballast water on the bottom, the sediments first accumulate at the far end, with the sediments volume fraction climbs up to 10 – 30 %, before gradually getting removed over time. Further, higher inlet velocity leads to a more rapid decrease of average sediments proportion in the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> over time, but the energy consumption in circulating pump significantly increases as well.

25|$|Discharge {{of cargo}} {{residues}} from bulk carriers can pollute ports, waterways, and oceans.

25|$|Submarines {{typically}} rely {{on speed}} and deck angle (angle of attack) rather than deballasting to surface; they are propelled {{at an angle}} towards the surface. <b>Ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> were almost never blown at depth, and doing so could cause the submarine to rocket to the surface out of control.
