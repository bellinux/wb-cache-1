500|$|Although Hammill {{has written}} the vast {{majority}} of the songs in the band's catalogue, and all of the lyrics, he is keen to stress that the arrangements of the music comes from all the group's members. In 1976, being interviewed for the Melody Maker, he said that [...] "VDGG is a band, a real band... of course [...] is something special, it releases in individual terms parts of us that wouldn't be aired otherwise. In 2013, he reiterated, [...] "Some people don't think Van der Graaf is a democracy, <b>but</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> it's entirely democratic, with everyone having very vocal and forceful opinions." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{mentioned}} jokingly in a 1990 BBC Television {{interview on}} the program Omnibus, that the main theme of the video and the cat metaphor represented that [...] "Pussy rules the world". She added {{that the idea of}} the cat licking the milk and then pour it over, was the director's. [...] "It's great <b>but</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me</b> I fought him on that. I didn't want to do it. I thought it's just so over the top and silly and kind of cliched, an art student or a film student's kind of trick. I'm glad that I gave in to him." ...|$|E
500|$|On 21 February 2011, Olympiacos beat Panathinaikos in Karaiskaki Stadium (2–1), after a {{controversial}} (regarding the referee's decisions) game. After the game, Cisse had a wrangle with Olympiacos' president Evangelos Marinakis. He was beaten by Olympiakos' fans (later called them [...] "barbarians") {{and stated that}} he was going to appeal to the UEFA. He stated also that he had lost his patience with the questionable, according to his opinion, refereeing in Greece: [...] "I will make my decisions <b>but</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> I’ve had enough. I can’t go on under these conditions." [...] One month later, Cissé reached 50 goals as a Panathinaikos player in domestic and European competitions. He celebrated this goal by wearing a T-shirt of Panathinaikos supporters group Gate 13. Cisse left Greece and Panathinaikos after celebrating in a farewell party with him as the DJ and he gave a promise to Panathinaikos fans that he will return.|$|E

2500|$|According to Robert Southey, poet laureate, in his {{response}} to Charlotte, ladies from a good background should be content with an education and a marriage embellished with some decorative talents. Mr Brontë also said {{to one of the}} characters in his The Maid of Kilarney, without one knowing whether it truly reflected a widespread opinion in order to support it or to condemn it: [...] "The education of female ought, most assuredly, to be competent, in order that she might enjoy herself, and be a fit companion for man. <b>But,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> lovely, delicate and sprightly woman, is not formed by nature, to pore over the musty pages of Grecian and Roman literature, or to plod through the windings of Mathematical Problems, nor has Providence assigned for her sphere of action, either the cabinet or the field. Her forte is softness, tenderness and grace." [...] In any case, it seemed to contradict his attitude towards his daughters whom he encouraged even if he was not completely aware of what they did with their time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Drink this, dear," [...] he begged, [...] "and don't be alarmed. It {{sounds very}} terrible, <b>but</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me</b> {{there is nothing}} to be feared." ...|$|E

6000|$|Give my kind {{regards to}} Lady Julia, {{and tell her}} how very [...] much obliged to her I am. I cannot express the {{gratitude}} [...] which I owe to you. <b>But</b> pray <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> my dear Lord De [...] Guest, always very faithfully yours, ...|$|R
6000|$|... “She {{addressed}} me as Mademoiselle, too, so nicely. I {{was struck}} with veneration for her white hair <b>but</b> her face, <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> my dear young Monsieur, has {{not so many}} wrinkles as mine.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Only," [...] said I, [...] "that {{you would}} not {{confound}} them with the others. They may be of the same blood, <b>but,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> they are not of the same nature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad they}} like it, Grace. <b>But,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> {{it will be}} some job for Tom {{to settle down and}} be a staid married man! He was always so full of fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And I have vexed and {{disappointed}} him more!' exclaimed she. 'No wonder he was angry, {{and ready to}} impute anything! <b>But</b> he will <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> he will forgive me, he will take me home.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Em'ly's her name,' said Mr. Omer, 'and she's little too. <b>But</b> if you'll <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> she {{has such}} a face of her own that half {{the women in this}} town are mad against her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I did. What {{else could}} I {{say when he}} asked me? It wouldn't have been civil to have {{told him that his}} time and words were all thrown away. <b>But,</b> Thorne, <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> when a man's heart is sad--sad--sad to the core, a few words from a parson at the last moment will never make it all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's quite {{a commonplace}} occurrence, though I suppose it will {{seem like a}} miracle to you. <b>But,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> it has {{happened}} before. If it hadn't, you and I wouldn't be here now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Why PIGOT, complain, [...] Of this damsel's disdain, [...] Why thus in despair, do you fret? [...] For months you may try, [...] <b>But</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me</b> a sigh, [...] Will never {{obtain a}} coquette.|$|E

6000|$|... "Some day," [...] he said, [...] "I {{probably}} shall. <b>But</b> not yet. <b>Believe</b> <b>me</b> or not, as you choose, {{but there}} are certain positions in which ignorance is the only possible safe state. You are in such a position at the present moment." ...|$|R
60|$|Genius {{may co-exist}} with wildness, idleness, folly, even with crime; <b>but</b> not long, <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> with selfishness, and the indulgence of an envious disposition. Envy is *[Greek: kakistos kai dikaiotatos theos], as I once saw it {{expressed}} somewhere in {{a page of}} Stobaeus: it dwarfs and withers its worshippers.|$|R
6000|$|My tone {{left her}} no {{alternative}} <b>but</b> to <b>believe</b> <b>me.</b> She looked not only bewildered, but alarmed. [...] "Oh, poor man, has he lost himself {{in such a}} dreadful way as that?" [...] she said to herself. [...] "I daren't believe it!" [...] She turned to me. [...] "You have been talking with him for some time. Please try to remember. While Mr. Gracedieu was speaking of Euneece, did he say nothing of Helena's infamous conduct to her sister?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] he said, [...] "you may {{trust me}} in this as though I were your father. I know that such {{publicity}} is painful; <b>but,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> {{it is the best}} that we can do." ...|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE (afraid that he {{has hurt}} her). It has been hard to say and I have done it bunglingly. Ah, <b>but</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> Miss Livvy, {{it is not the}} flaunting flower men love; it is the modest violet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir knight," [...] Mr. Ormskirk said, smiling, [...] "I {{have not}} yet congratulated you on your honour, <b>but,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> I was right glad when I heard the news. You have had but little fighting, I hear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He 'ad a fancy for it," [...] ses Bob Pretty, [...] "and being a 'armless {{amusement}} we let him 'ave his own way.

6000|$|... "Yes, I do. <b>But</b> {{they will}} <b>believe</b> <b>me.</b> I will confess everything.

My whole soul has never consented; it does not consent now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} are; <b>but</b> pray <b>believe</b> <b>me</b> {{that you need}} not be alarmed. I {{do not mean to}} be unhappy. Indeed, I think I may say I am not unhappy; of course I have been unhappy,--very unhappy. I did think that my heart would break. But that has passed away, and I believe I can be as happy as my neighbours. We're all of us sure to have some troubles, as you used to tell us when we were children." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Burton," [...] he protested, [...] "I cannot {{help feeling}} {{a certain amount}} of admiration for your point of view, <b>but,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> you are entirely in the wrong. I beg that you will think this matter over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My own sweet girl, my sister, if you please, any title, so it {{be one of}} fondness, your sweet {{simplicity}} charms me; <b>but,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> it {{cannot be}} as you wish; we cannot remain as we are unless we marry.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You wish {{to leave}} me, Princess," [...] said he; [...] "it is my unhappy fate--you {{are not to}} blame. I consent to your going, <b>but,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> I can give you no {{stronger}} proof of my love than by so doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We've {{got to do}} {{something}} about that child, Ogden. He's been worrying uncle Peter again, and I'm not going to have it.
