5|$|<b>Being</b> <b>like</b> Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. When I joined the Regiment I {{was told that}} the best way to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought you would like to be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me there were a number of the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E
5|$|Next, Cuvier {{identifies}} the taxonomic {{divisions of the}} group, in this case four orders of reptiles, the chelonians (tortoises and turtles), saurians (lizards), ophidians (snakes) and batracians (amphibians, now considered a separate class of vertebrates), describing each group in a single sentence. Thus the batracians {{are said to have}} a heart with a single atrium, a naked body (with no scales), and to pass with age from being fish-like to <b>being</b> <b>like</b> a quadruped or biped.|$|E

Spender tells Kersh that Mulder and Scully could have {{prevented}} their demise, and recommends that they be reassigned to the X-Files before abruptly leaving the room. Heading to the X-Files office in the basement, Spender finds The Smoking Man, who first berates Spender for not <b>being</b> <b>like</b> Mulder and then shoots him in the head.|$|E

Therefore, {{the higher the}} number of senses and vitalities a being has, the more is its capacity to suffer and feel pain. Hence according to Jainism, violence to higher-sensed <b>beings</b> <b>like</b> man, cow, tiger {{and those who have}} five senses and the capacity to think and feel pain attracts more karma than violence to lesser-sensed <b>beings</b> <b>like</b> insects, or single-sensed <b>beings</b> <b>like</b> microbes and plants.|$|R

5|$|The poem {{has three}} eleven-line stanzas which {{describe}} a progression through the season, {{from the late}} maturation of the crops to the harvest and to {{the last days of}} autumn when winter is nearing. The imagery is richly achieved through the personification of Autumn, and the description of its bounty, its sights and sounds. It has parallels in the work of English landscape artists, with Keats himself describing the fields of stubble that he saw on his walk as <b>being</b> <b>like</b> that in a painting.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Orr turned 16 in 1964, {{he was still}} two years away from playing in the NHL and his father Doug was {{dissatisfied}} with the Bruins' treatment of the prospect. Doug had asked the Bruins' Blair for more money for Bobby and was turned down. Doug Orr met Toronto lawyer Alan Eagleson at a juvenile fastball tournament dinner in Parry Sound and asked Eagleson to help out with the situation. Eagleson agreed {{to work with the}} family for free and continued to do so for the next two years. Bobby and Eagleson developed a relationship Orr would later describe as <b>being</b> <b>like</b> brothers. The two soon became a team, discussing Bobby's future plans without his father Doug.|$|E
5|$|The {{secret was}} not kept for long, and Gordon-Cumming demanded a {{retraction}} from the Wilson family, whom he considered {{to blame for}} divulging the news. They refused, and he filed a writ for slander in February 1891. Despite {{the efforts of the}} prince's courtiers to have the matter dealt with by a military court, the case was heard in June 1891. The atmosphere at trial was described as <b>being</b> <b>like</b> a theatre, and Edward was called as a witness, the first time the heir to the throne had been compelled to appear in court since 1411. Gordon-Cumming's senior counsel, the Solicitor General Sir Edward Clarke, did not persuade any of the defendants to change their stories, but he highlighted several inaccuracies and serious discrepancies in their evidence. Despite a strong and well-regarded closing speech by Clarke on Gordon-Cumming's behalf, the judge's summing up was described as biased by some, and the jury found against the lieutenant colonel.|$|E

5|$|When Bart {{finds out}} her secret and reveals {{it to the}} school, her social ranking plummets to a new low until a psychic force tells Lady Gaga that Lisa needs her help immediately. After much soul searching and yelling at Lady Gaga for trying to help, Lisa realizes that her {{outburst}} helped her because she is finally expressing her anger instead of bottling it up inside her, in effect making Lady Gaga's mission successful. Lisa catches Lady Gaga just before she leaves town to apologize, and after being forgiven she and Lady Gaga perform a duet together. With Lady Gaga's assistance, Lisa and the entire town of Springfield realize that being oneself is better than <b>being</b> <b>like</b> anyone else. Just as Lady Gaga's train begins to leave again, Moe runs {{up to her and}} asks if she can help him as well, but Lady Gaga declines, stating that she's not that good. As Moe turns and walks across the train track, a second train hits him.|$|E

Each is a trick, and together they train the reader to sniff out bunk and to reject the unacceptable.|$|E
