50|$|This type of bone-conduction also {{involves}} low frequencies. As a <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> vibrates the skull, {{the bone and}} cartilage of the external ear receives energy, most of which escapes the unoccluded ear. Some of this energy hits the tympanic membrane and combines with inertial bone-conduction, stimulating the inner ear. An example of this occurs when you close your ears and speak- your voice appears to be much lower in frequency.|$|E
50|$|The {{ossicles}} {{are suspended}} {{in the head and}} loosely coupled to the skull. When the head moves, the ossicles move out of phase with the head, but still follow the same cyclic motion.

Putting the <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> on the forehead instead of the mastoid does not significantly create this affect.|$|E

40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{prediction}} that interaural phase differences (IPDs) are converted to interaural level differences (ILDs) with bilateral bone-conduction stimulation {{due to the}} effects of acoustic interference arising from transcranial transmission. Seven normal-hearing listeners judged the lateral position of 3000 - 6000 -Hz pure tones, presented via <b>bone</b> <b>vibrators</b> on the mastoids, as a function of IPD. Evidence for lateralization was obtained in five listeners despite humans being insensitive to IPD in pure tones at these frequencies. The direction of lateralization depended on frequency, as well as IPD, for three listeners. It is argued that {{these findings are consistent with}} the conversion of external IPD to internal ILD during transcranial transmission. Inter-individual variation in lateralization was apparent and no evidence of lateralization was found in two listeners at the frequency tested, which may reflect, at least in part, inter-individual variation in transcranial transmission properties. The notion that external IPD within the waveform fine-structure at high-frequencies does not influence localization with air conduction may not apply to bone conduction due to the acoustic interference effects...|$|R

A secondary consideration addressed in this study was the comparison of the discrimination scores using the three transducers. Performance-intensity functions for spondee thresholds were calculated on 12 normal hearing subjects using two <b>bone</b> conduction <b>vibrators,</b> the Radioear B- 72 and Pracitronic KH- 70, and TDH- 39 earphones.

50|$|The first {{clinical}} {{application of}} titanium was in oral surgery, where implants {{were used for}} retention of dentures. Brånemark sought an acoustic way to evaluate osseointegration. A patient with implants in the jaws was fitted with a <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> {{on one of his}} implants. When tested, the patient experienced very loud sound even at low stimulation levels, indicating sound could propagate very well in the bone.

40|$|Abstract: For {{assessment}} of safety, {{it is necessary}} to measure the maximum possible force exerted by a bone conduction device coupled to the human head. Calibration of bone conduc-tion hearing aids and vibrators in the audiometric range is based on measurement of accelera-tion and force using an artificial mastoid. Extending the measurement to the high audio range was accomplished using a live head. To assess safety of the UltraQuiet tinnitus treatment sys-tem, as an example, acceleration was measured from 5 to 20 kHz on a live human head as com-pared with calibrated levels at 6 kHz on an artificial mastoid and the live head. Using head acceleration and anchoring it to established calibration levels is a means of establishing clini-cal safety. Stimulation in the high audio frequencies at low levels was found to be safe. In con-trast, stimulation with ultrasound requires more energy (approximately 75 - 90 dB re 6 kHz), which may increase the risk of damage to the ear.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{contribution}} of the skull contents to the transmission of bone vibratory stimuli, and to examine the characteristics of such stimuli, we compared auditory thresholds and distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) levels with a <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> placed on various sites of the head, including the eye. The best audiometric thresholds and the highest DPOAE levels were obtained with the vibrator placed on the mastoid of the measuring side, or on the "ultrasound-window" of the temple.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of human hearing under water is debated. Some suggest {{it is by}} air conduction (AC), others by bone conduction (BC), and others {{by a combination of}} AC and BC. A clinical <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> applied to soft tissue sites on the head, neck, and thorax also elicits hearing by a mechanism called soft tissue conduction (STC) or nonosseous BC. The present study was designed to test whether underwater hearing at low intensities is by AC or by osseous BC based on bone vibrations or by nonosseous BC (STC). Thresholds of normal hearing participants to <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> stimulation with their forehead in air were recorded and again when forehead and <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> were under water. A vibrometer detected vibrations of a dry human skull in all similar conditions (in air and under water) but not when water was the intermediary between the sound source and the skull forehead. Therefore, the intensities required to induce vibrations of the dry skull in water were significantly higher than the underwater hearing thresholds of the participants, under conditions when hearing by AC and osseous BC is not likely. The results support the hypothesis that hearing under water at low sound intensities may be attributed to nonosseous BC (STC) ...|$|E
40|$|Hearing by air {{conduction}} (AC) and bone conduction (BC) {{are attributed to}} be the natural ways of stimulating the cochlea. With AC hearing, the cochlea is stimulated by air pressure variations via the ear canal, whereas with BC hearing, sound vibrations are transmitted thru the skull bone to the cochlea. Sensorineural hearing losses are commonly rehabilitated with conventional AC hearing aids in the ear canal, but patients who are suffering from conductive or mixed hearing losses, and who are unable to use AC hearing aids, may instead use bone conduction devices (BCDs). In order to determine the type and degree of hearing loss, the BC hearing thresholds are measured using a <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator,</b> and then analyzed together with the AC hearing thresholds to suggest an appropriate rehabilitation alternative. This thesis deals with two BC hearing related topics.

40|$|Diagnosis {{of hearing}} level in small {{children}} with {{conductive hearing loss}} associated with congenital craniofacial abnormalities, particularly with agenesis of external ear and external auditory meatus is a pressing issue. Conventional methods of assessing hearing {{in the first years}} of life, i. e. registration of brainstem auditory evoked responses to acoustic stimuli in the event of air conduction, does not give an indication of the auditory analyzer’s condition due to potential conductive hearing loss in these patients. This study was aimed at assessing potential of diagnosing the auditory analyzer’s function with registering brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAERs) to acoustic stimuli transmitted by means of a <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator.</b> The study involved 17 children aged 3 – 10 years with normal hearing. We compared parameters of registering brainstem auditory evoked responses (peak V) depending on the type of stimulus transmission (air/bone) in children with normal hearing. The data on thresholds of the BAERs registered to acoustic stimuli in the event of air and bone conduction obtained in this study are comparable; hearing thresholds in the event of acoustic stimulation by means of a <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> correlates with the results of the BAERs registered to the stimuli transmitted by means of air conduction earphones (r = 0. 9).

40|$|SummaryBone {{conduction}} hearing inevitably involves vibration of the {{basilar membrane}} {{in response to}} a pressure gradient {{on either side of the}} membrane. The propagated wave that symbolizes this vibration of the basilar membrane can be triggered intentionally, when a <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> is placed on the mastoid bone, or inadvertently when testing hearing of one ear by air conduction while disregarding transmission of the sound to the other side. When hearing is tested with a <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator,</b> the pathways leading to the basilar membrane can be divided into two main categories. The first type of pathway short-circuits the middle ear and comprises three distinct mechanisms: cochlear fluid inertia, compression of the cochlear walls, and pressure changes exerted via cerebrospinal fluid. In the second type of pathway, the stimulus reaches the basilar membrane via the middle ear, either directly or via the outer ear. Although it is difficult to precisely determine the contribution of each of these pathways to the basilar membrane, bone conduction remains the clinically most reliable way of directly testing cochlear function...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the human capability to use selective auditory attention across the two different hearing pathways, air conduction and bone conduction. Four two channel communication systems were used as a basis for comparison: (1) both channels presented via headphones (left ear and right ear each represent a different channel), (2) two channels presented via loudspeakers placed at 135 ° and 225 °, (3) one channel presented via headphones (both ears) and one channel to <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> (placed at the condoyle), and (4) one channel presented via <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> and one channel via loud speakers (placed at 135 ° and 225 °). The SATASK sentence database was used as auditory stimuli. For the four systems chosen, each channel presented a different sentence, in a different voice, simultaneously. Listeners were assigned a target sentence and asked to record various elements of the SATASK sentence for the target presentation. The results showed that when bone conduction is used as a channel in the communication systems chosen, the speech intelligibility scores were slightly decreased, but the differences were not statistically significant. The only systems where the differences in the scores were significant were the loudspeakers and the system that combined bone conduction and air conduction...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} is to evaluate the electro-acoustic performance of a new audiometric <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator,</b> the B 81 from Radioear Corporation, USA. Comparison will be made with the widely used B 71 which has well-known limitations at low frequencies. Design: The B 81 {{is based on the}} balanced electromagnetic separation transducer (BEST) principle where static forces are counterbalanced so that nonlinear distortion forces are reduced and maximum hearing levels can be increased. Study sample: Maximum hearing level, total harmonic distortion (THD), frequency response, and electrical impedance were measured for six devices of each <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> type on an artificial mastoid. Results: It was found that B 81 reaches 10. 7 - 22. 0 dB higher maximum (@ THD. 6 % or V-in. 6 V-RMS) hearing levels than B 71 for frequencies below 1500 Hz, and had significantly lower THD up to 1000 Hz. There was no statistically significant difference between their frequency response, except a deviation at the mid frequencies (alpha = 0. 01) where B 81 was more efficient and the electrical impedances were practically the same. Conclusions: In general, B 81 had an improved electro-acoustic performance compared to B 71 and is compatible with same audiometers. In particular, B 81 allows for sensorineural hearing loss to be measured at considerably higher hearing levels than with B 71 below 1500 Hz...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{currently}} available methods {{for measuring the}} occlusion effect (OE) of hearing protection devices (HPDs) have limitations. Objective microphonic measurements do not assess bone-conducted sounds directly transmitted to the cochlea. Psychophysical measurements at threshold are biased due to the low-frequency masking effects from test participants’ physiological noise and the variability of measurements based on subjective responses. An auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) procedure {{is used as a}} technique that might overcome these limitations. Participants and Methods: Pure-tone stimuli (250 and 500 [*]Hz), with amplitude modulated at 40 [*]Hz, were presented to twelve adults with normal hearing through a <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> at three levels in 10 -dB steps. The following two conditions were assessed: the unoccluded ear canal and occluded ear canal.

40|$|Introduction: Treacher-Collins {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} craniofacial malformations, narrowing of {{the external auditory canal}} (EAC), and, in 30 % of cases, agenesis of the canal and ossicular chain defects. The use of hearing aids (HA) is not possible in cases in which agenesis or stenosis of the EAC accompanies conductive deafness. In contrast, bone conduction implants such as the Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA®) allow direct stimulation of the cochlea and are thus superior to conventional hearing aids in cases of severe conductive hearing loss. Objective: To present 2 cases of patients with Treacher-Collins syndrome who underwent implantation of BAHA®. Cases Reports: The first patient was a 52 -year-old woman diagnosed with Treacher-Collins syndrome who presented with severe bilateral mixed hearing loss and a history of unsuccessful previous use of a bone contact conduction device. The BAHA® implantation was uneventful, and the post-operative results were good. The second patient was a 14 -year-old girl who was also diagnosed with Treacher-Collins Syndrome with bilateral moderate conductive hearing loss by audiometry. The use of a <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> contact device did not improve her hearing; however, implantation of a BAHA® resulted in a decreased gap postoperatively.

Design: (1) The cochlear promontory motion was measured in cadaver heads using laser Doppler vibrometry while seven different positions around the pinna were stimulated using a bone anchored hearing aid transducer attached using a headband. (2) The BC hearing thresholds were measured in human subjects, with the <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> Radioear B 71 attached to the same seven stimulation positions. Study sample: Three cadaver heads and twenty participants. Results: Stimulation on a position superior-anterior to the pinna generated the largest promontory motion and the lowest BC thresholds. Stimulations on the positions superior to the pinna, the mastoid, and posterior-inferior to the pinna showed similar magnitudes of promontory motion and similar levels of BC thresholds. Conclusion: Stimulations on the regions superior to the pinna, the mastoid, and posterior-inferior to the pinna provide stable BC transmission, and are insensitive to small changes of the stimulation position. Therefore it is reliable to use the mastoid to determine BC thresholds in clinical audiometry.

Twenty young normal-hearing adults (10 male and 10 female) participated in the study. As stimulus, Korean spondee words were presented via one of five skull locations (i. e., jaw angle, condyle, temple, mastoid, and vertex), while the participants wore one of four protection methods (i. e., ear form, ear plug, ear muff, and ear form and muff together) against white noise in one of four noise directions (i. e., 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees). The results showed: 1) {{there was a significant difference}} among the five skull locations with condyle being the most sensitive placement; 2) there was a significant difference among the four protection methods, with the ear form plus ear muff condition (or dual protection) providing the lowest threshold; 3) when exposed to noise from 90 degrees, the significantly lowest threshold was found; 4) there was no significant difference in results by gender.

40|$|Body sway and {{vibration}} {{perception in}} the lower limbs were measured in 32 normal subjects and 25 patients with peripheral neuropathies; nerve conduction studies were also performed in the patients with neuropathies. Body sway was measured by means of force-plate posturography, and three methods {{were used to assess}} vibration perception: a neurothesiometer, a semiquantitative tuning fork, and the <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> of a conventional audiometer. Body sway and vibration perception were increased in the patients with peripheral neuropathies and there was significant correlation between these measures. d These findings, together with the lack of correlation between sway and muscle strength, indicate that the main source of unsteadiness in these patients is the loss of proprioceptive information. Vibration perception and body sway did not correlate with the electrophysiological variables, indicating that these measures assess different aspects of peripheral nerve function. In all subjects there was close correlation between vibration perception as assessed by the neurothesiometer and the audiometer could be used to screen proprioceptive function in patients with balance disorders. In normal subjects age correlated with vibration perception (measured with the neurothesiometer and audiometer) and also with body sway standing on foam.

40|$|Objectives: Auditory {{sensation}} can be elicited by {{air conduction}} (AC) and by bone conduction (BC). It {{is also possible}} to elicit such responses by applying the standard clinical <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> to the skin over soft tissue sites on the head, neck, or thorax of humans and animals. This mode of auditory stimulation has been called soft tissue conduction (STC). This {{study was designed to}} investigate the pathway between soft tissue sites and the ear. Methods: The air in the middle ear was replaced with saline solution in an animal with unique anatomy — the fat sand rat, in which about 70 % of a thin-walled inner ear bulges into the middle ear bulla cavity — while we recorded the audi-tory brain stem responses (ABRs) to AC, BC, and STC stimulation. Results: This replacement of air with saline solution led to a significant improvement in STC threshold. With AC stimu-lation, the ABR threshold was elevated and the latency of the first ABR wave was prolonged. Consistent changes were not seen with BC stimulation. Conclusions: When the air (which has a very low acoustic impedance) that normally surrounds most of the inner ear is replaced with saline solution (which has an acoustic impedance similar to that of soft tissues), the STC threshold is improved. This improvement may be due to improved transmission of acoustic energy from the soft tissues to the inner ear...|$|E

Experimental in vivo study. A total of 18 adult male White New Zealand rabbits, weighing 3. 0 ± 0. 250 Kg and about 6 months old were used. They were fasted 4 h before start of experiment and were off-water even 2 h too. They were divided into 2 groups of bone plate (I) and cement (II) of 9 rabbits each which subsequently divided into 3 subgroups of 1 (I a and II a) month and 2 (Ib and IIb) and 3 (Ic and IIc) months duration in each group. Approach: Under general anesthesia and aseptic condition the craniolateral surface of right radial was exposed and a piece of full thickness from mid-section of radial bone in length of 1 cm was removed using electrical <b>bone</b> <b>vibrator</b> in the all rabbit. The both ends of this bone was stabilized using mini bone plate of 4 holes in the group I, whereas prehardened cylinders of cement were implanted into rabbit radial defects in the group II rabbits. Radiographs were taken on zero days after creation of gap and on 1, 2 and 3 months from each rabbit using parameters such as local changes, stabilization of implant and bone, bone formation and implant biodegradation. Results: Comparison of clinical signs in the I and II indicated that they had similar physical activity and same degree of lameness during observation period of 90 days Radiographyically keeping in view the parameters were used to evaluate the major changes revealed no sign of infection on the edges of each defect and both groups permitted stabilization of the defected bones and maintenance of correct position. The new bone formation and the implant biodegradation in the bone defects could be clearly reflected by the gradually weakened umbral on the radiographs during the whole process one repair in group I was not as perfect as those in cement or group II samples.
