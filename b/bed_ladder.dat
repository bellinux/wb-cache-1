50|$|In {{the morning}} Marty can't find all her animals {{and as the}} bin men had already been, presumes that Melissa has thrown them in the bin. Marty begins to pull off Baba's limbs but as a shocked Melissa climbs up the bunk <b>bed</b> <b>ladder</b> to get to Marty, the ladder breaks and causes her to lose her grip and fall. Melissa gets taken to {{hospital}} where she is visited by Marty, who meets a young artist called Mattie. Marty and her dad return home and she finds her animals were under the bed all along. Marty sews together Baba and takes it to the hospital where Melissa is very thankful. The story ends with Marty saying how much she loves Melissa.|$|E
50|$|The Loft <b>Bed</b> <b>Ladder</b> - The contestants, to {{complete}} the loft bed, must build a ladder out of ABS plumbing pipes. Deen got pipes, but not T joints to make the rungs; some were provided to him so he would not fail. After Andrew lashes out at everyone (Simon in particular) for not reading the instructions to the adhesive when assembling the ladder. Matt fails as he had purchased PVC adhesive instead of ABS adhesive (which {{would mean that the}} adhesion was, at best, only temporary). Cory fails as his adhesive sets before he assembles the whole ladder. Deen also fails when he admitted that he had never closed the adhesive can lid the whole time he was using it, which allowed the adhesive to set. Angela and Simon also fail, though Simon learns an important lesson on reading the instructions.|$|E

Some models also have a privacy curtain for the lower bunk. Because of the need for a ladder and the height of the bed, the top bunk of a bunk bed is not recommended for children under six years of age.|$|R
3000|$|After {{the initial}} period [of fuelbreak construction] …area {{treatments}} would also aim to reduce fuel <b>beds</b> and fire <b>ladders,</b> but probably {{to a standard}} somewhat less strict than the defensible fuelbreak prescription, and without the need to support direct suppression of intense wildfire within these areas…” [...]...|$|R
