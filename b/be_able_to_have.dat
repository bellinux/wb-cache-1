By February 1999, Siemens had given up trying to fix the locomotives, although they had established that the main fault lay in the generators. The issue never reached the courts. On 5 May 1999, the companies announcement that they had reached an agreement for the trains to be returned to Siemens, and NOK485 million be compensated to NSB. This was in addition to NOK80 million which had already been given as discount. In addition to the purchase price, the compensation included interest and coverage for NSB's extra expenses. The locomotives were immediately dismounted of NSB-owned equipment and on 20May sent by ship to Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|That same year, Brian Hodgson, who {{had spent}} many years in Nepal serving as the Assistant Resident, and who had a good {{knowledge}} about Nepal's bio-diversity, culture, and politics, became the new British Resident. Although the British Residents were officially instructed {{to keep out of}} the internal politics of Nepal, the Resident was courted by both the King as well as the Mukhtiyar. Hodgson was waiting for an opportunity to exploit the rift between the Mukhtiyar and the royal family and begin a more aggressive campaign to increase British influence and trading opportunities. Hodgson also believed the large standing army to be a security threat and that the border tensions could be pacified if the King was directly in control, rather than a mukhtiyar who needed to keep {{on the right side of}} the army. By 1834, Hodgson had come to a conclusion that he would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his way so long as Bhimsen was in control of the Nepalese administration; thus he strongly sympathized with the Pande faction, and he wished to install Fateh Jung Shah, who was more favorably disposed to him, as the mukhtiyar. In August 1834, Hodgson proposed to conduct a new commercial treaty between Nepal and Britain, which Bhimsen in principle agreed to but disagreed with several of the clauses. At a time when his authority was diminishing, Bhimsen could not afford to antagonize the Resident; but at the same time, he could not accept his proposals and be seen as subservient to the British by the Nepalese court. Nevertheless, he tried to maintain a friendly and conciliatory attitude toward the Resident, in order to win him as his ally, by loosening the restrictions on his movements and granting direct access to the King.|$|E

25|$|The {{delay in}} {{fertility}} becomes a problem among middle class women when they delay childbirth past their fertility peak. Since fertility peaks {{at a certain}} age, pushing childbirth past that age significantly decreases the probability that certain women will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> children. The media has been an influence on women's fertility choices: popular celebrities who have managed to have children well into their forties and other medical miracles covered in the media oftentimes give women false hope that they themselves will {{also be able to}} bear children later in life. For every success story, however, there are many more disappointments.|$|E

25|$|Once work on {{the actual}} Chrono Cross started, the initial vision beyond {{character}} recruitment was even more expansive. The game initially was intended to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the player recruit any person they encountered, through either interacting or battling them. However, eventually the development team found this to be too ambitious, and narrowed it down to 64 playable characters, and then again down to 45 characters for the final game, which were then drawn by character designer Nobuteru Yūki. The backgrounds of some minor characters were left {{to members of the}} staff. The development team also considered the idea of having each character have their own ending, each with three variant scenarios based on events occurred in the game, leading to over 120 endings, but the idea was scrapped as being not feasible.|$|E
25|$|Overwatch is Blizzard's fourth major {{franchise}} {{and came}} about following the 2014 {{cancellation of the}} ambitious massively multiplayer online role-playing game Titan.

Some elements of Overwatch borrow assets and concepts from the canceled Titan project. After establishing the narrative of an optimistic near-future Earth setting after a global crisis, the developers aimed to create a diverse cast of heroes that spanned genders and ethnicities as part of this setting. Significant time was spent adjusting the balance of the characters, making sure that new players would still <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fun while skilled players would present each other with a challenge.|$|E

Hector had fought in the Cuban Revolution for Fidel Castro, but became disillusioned with the changes brought by communism after Castro came to power. According to Pedro, any mention of Castro in their home would result in a tirade from Hector which earned him a reputation with local informants. As a result, life became difficult for the Zamoras who lived in a small house with a dirt floor. Food was scarce and Zoraida traded on the black market for food.|$|E
