5|$|Amanita onusta, {{commonly}} known as the loaded Lepidella or the gunpowder Lepidella, is a species of fungus in the Amanitaceae family of mushrooms. It is characterized by its small to medium-sized fruit bodies that have white to pale gray caps crowded with roughly conical, pyramidal, or irregular gray warts. The stipe is whitish-gray with woolly or wart-like veil remnants, and at the base is a spindle- or turnip-shaped base that is rooted somewhat deeply in the soil. The species is distributed in eastern North America, from Nova Scotia to Mexico, and may be found growing on the ground in deciduous forests, particularly those with oak, hickory and chestnut. Fruit bodies smell somewhat like <b>bleaching</b> <b>powder,</b> and their edibility is unknown, but possibly toxic.|$|E

500|$|John Hutchinson {{built his}} first factory in 1847 on land between the Sankey Canal and the railway making alkali by the Leblanc process. [...] This was an ideal {{site for the}} factory because all the raw {{materials}} could be transported there by the waterways and railway, and the finished products could similarly be transported {{anywhere else in the}} country or overseas. Further chemical factories were soon built nearby by entrepreneurs including John McClelland, William Gossage, Frederic Muspratt, Holbrook Gaskell and Henry Deacon. [...] The town grew rapidly as housing and social provision was made for the factory workers. Soon the villages of Farnworth, Appleton, Ditton and Upton were subsumed within the developing town of Widnes. Woodend became known as West Bank. The substances produced included soap, borax, soda ash, salt cake and <b>bleaching</b> <b>powder.</b> Other industries developed including iron and copper works. [...] The town became heavily polluted with smoke and the by-products of the chemical processes. [...] In 1888 the town was described as [...] "the dirtiest, ugliest and most depressing town in England" [...] and in 1905 as a [...] "poisonous hell-town".|$|E
50|$|Donkey {{stones were}} made from a mixture of {{pulverised}} stone, cement, <b>bleach</b> <b>powder</b> and water.

40|$|Respiratory {{symptoms}} among hairdressers {{are often}} {{ascribed to the}} use of <b>bleaching</b> <b>powders</b> that contain persulfate salts. Such salts can act as allergens and airway irritants but the mechanisms behind the negative health effects are not fully known. In order to understand why some hairdressers experience respiratory symptoms during, and after, sessions of hair bleaching, it is of importance to characterize how exposure occurs. In this work we used time and particle size resolved instrumentation with the aim to measure the concentration of particles that hairdressers are exposed to during sessions of hair bleaching. We also used filter samples to collect particles for quantitative determination of persulfate (S 2 O 8 (2 -)) content and for analysis by light microscopy. Two different types of <b>bleaching</b> <b>powders</b> were used, one marked as dust-free and one without this marking (denoted regular). The time resolved instrumentation revealed that particles 10 µm) were emitted during application of the bleaching, when both the regular and the dust-free powders were used. The measured level of persulfate, sampled in the breathing zone of the hairdressers, was on average 26 µg m(- 3) when the regular powder was used and 11 µg m(- 3) when the dust-free powder was used. This indicates that use of dust-free powder does not eliminate exposure to persulfates, it only lowers the concentration. We show that the site of sampling, or position of the hairdresser with regards to the hair being bleached, is of high importance in the determination of persulfate levels and exposure. This work focuses on the physical and chemical characterization of the particles released to the air and the results are important for accurate exposure assessments. Accurate assessments may in turn lead {{to a better understanding of}} why some hairdressers experience respiratory symptoms from hair bleaching sessions...|$|R
500|$|Chlorine gas {{was first}} used by French chemist Claude Berthollet to bleach {{textiles}} in 1785. Modern bleaches resulted from further work by Berthollet, who first produced sodium hypochlorite in 1789 in his laboratory {{in the town of}} Javel (now part of Paris, France), by passing chlorine gas through a solution of sodium carbonate. The resulting liquid, known as [...] "Eau de Javel" [...] ("Javel water"), was a weak solution of sodium hypochlorite. This process was not very efficient, and alternative production methods were sought. Scottish chemist and industrialist Charles Tennant first produced a solution of calcium hypochlorite ("chlorinated lime"), then solid calcium hypochlorite (<b>bleaching</b> <b>powder).</b> These compounds produced low levels of elemental chlorine and could be more efficiently transported than sodium hypochlorite, which remained as dilute solutions because when purified to eliminate water, it became a dangerously powerful and unstable oxidizer. Near {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, E. S. Smith patented a method of sodium hypochlorite production involving electrolysis of brine to produce sodium hydroxide and chlorine gas, which then mixed to form sodium hypochlorite. This is known as the chloralkali process, first introduced on an industrial scale in 1892, and now the source of most elemental chlorine and sodium hydroxide. In 1884 Chemischen Fabrik Griesheim of Germany developed another chloralkali process which entered commercial production in 1888.|$|E

500|$|The cap of A.atkinsoniana is [...] wide, and {{depending}} on its age, ranges in shape from convex to flattened, sometimes with a shallow central depression. Its color can vary from whitish to yellowish-white, brownish-gray, brownish-orange to grayish-brown, and is lighter on the margin. The cap surface is covered with {{the remnants of the}} universal veil as small reddish-brown to grayish-brown, easily removable, conical warts. Approaching the edge of the cap, the warts gradually become small, woolly patches. The cap margin is smooth or has faint grooves mirroring the underlying gills, and has partial veil remnants hanging along the edge. The gills are free from attachment to the stem, close to crowded together, moderately broad, yellowish-white, and occasionally have a slight reddish stain. The lamellulae (short gills that do not extend completely from the cap margin to the stem) are truncate (cut off sharply) to attenuate. The stem is [...] long and [...] wide, equal or tapering slightly toward apex, whitish, and [...] to smooth. The basal bulb is club-shaped, - or turnip-shaped, rounded or pointed, usually covered with rings of reddish-brown scales or warts of universal veil remains, often extending up the stem for a short distance. The universal veil on the stem base is quite unusual in Amanita, because it forms warts that extend nearly to the very bottom of the bulb. The stem often roots into the soil beneath the bulb with an elongated cord of mycelium known as a pseudorhiza. The partial veil forms an ring that is somewhat membranous, fragile to moderately persistent, and yellowish-white to pale yellow. Eventually, as the mushroom matures, it collapses on the stem as a thin membrane. The flesh is white, with a weak odor of <b>bleaching</b> <b>powder.</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Persulfate salts are {{components}} of <b>bleaching</b> <b>powders</b> widely used by hairdressers during hair-bleaching procedures. Hairdressers {{are at high}} risk for occupational asthma and rhinitis, and ammonium persulfate is the main etiologic agent. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of ammonium persulfate on human albumin, mast cells, and basophils in order to evaluate a possible effect of ammonium persulfate oxidizing activity in the mechanism of ammonium persulfate-induced occupational asthma. METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was performed on ammonium persulfate-incubated human albumin. The activation of LAD 2 human mast cell and KU 812 human basophil cell lines incubated with ammonium persulfate was evaluated. CD 63 expression on persulfate-in-vitro-incubated blood basophils from nonexposed healthy controls (n = 31) and hairdressers with work-related respiratory symptoms (n = 29) was assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: No persulfate-albumin conjugate was found. An oxidative process on tryptophan and methionine was detected. Ammonium persulfate induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the degranulation of LAD 2 and KU 812 cells. Human basophils from healthy controls, incubated in vitro with ammonium persulfate, showed increased CD 63 expression and ROS production. In hairdressers with ammonium persulfate-caused occupational asthma (positive persulfate challenge), basophil-CD 63 expression was higher than in those with a negative challenge and in healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Ammonium persulfate incubated with human albumin did not generate any adduct but oxidized some amino acids. This oxidizing activity induced human mast cell and basophil activation which might be crucial in the mechanism of persulfate-induced occupational asthma and rhinitis...|$|R
40|$|Occupational asthma among hairdressers {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{for some years}} and cases of work related asthma due to hair bleaches containing persulphates and hair dyes have been reported. The extent of the disease among hairdressers remains unknown. An investigation was carried out on an entire hairdressing salon, which specialised in hair bleaching and colouring and which employed 23 staff. On the basis of history and specific and non-specific bronchial provocation testing, four out of 23 staff {{were found to have}} occupational asthma due to the persulphate salts contained in hair bleaches. Only one of these had a positive skinprick test response to persulphate salts. Tests for non-specific bronchial reactivity to histamine in this work force were more sensitive for the diagnosis of asthma than simple lung function tests or recordings of peak flow rates performed four times daily for three weeks. The response to these agents was studied in greater detail by specific bronchial provocation tests in 14 members of the salon as well as one hairdresser from elsewhere with occupational asthma, three individuals with non-occupational asthma, and four normal subjects. Only those with a history of work related asthma and bronchial hyperreactivity responded positively, confirming that the response to <b>bleach</b> <b>powders</b> was specific. Studies of pulmonary mechanics after challenge showed that the response arose from changes in airway calibre not lung volumes. Measurement of neutrophil chemotactic activity after challenge showed significant rises in those affected, suggesting that mast cells may play a part in the pathogenesis of occupational asthma due to persulphates...|$|R

In this study, three cleaning techniques, boiling bone in water, in <b>bleach,</b> and in <b>powdered</b> detergent/sodium carbonate, were tested for their effect on nuclear and mtDNA recovery from a variety of human and non-human bones. A statistically significant reduction in DNA yields occurred in non-human bones cleaned with bleach, and DNA degradation was apparent electrophoretically.

2500|$|In 1861, the Belgian chemist Ernest Solvay {{developed}} {{a more direct}} process for producing soda ash from salt and limestone {{through the use of}} ammonia. [...] The only waste product of this Solvay process was calcium chloride, and so it was both more economical and less polluting than the Leblanc method. [...] From the late 1870s, Solvay-based soda works on the European continent provided stiff competition in their home markets to the Leblanc-based British soda industry. Additionally the Brunner Mond Solvay plant which opened in 1874 at Winnington near Northwich provided fierce competition nationally. Leblanc producers were unable to compete with Solvay soda ash, and their soda ash production was effectively an adjunct to their still profitable production of chlorine, <b>bleaching</b> <b>powder</b> etc. (The unwanted by-products had become the profitable products). [...] The development of electrolytic methods of chlorine production removed that source of profits as well, and there followed a decline moderated only by [...] "gentlemen's' agreements" [...] with Solvay producers.

[...] The last Leblanc-based soda ash plant closed in the early 1920s.

40|$|Crude {{fish oil}} is an {{important}} ingredient in fish feed for fish farming; {{it can be used}} as functional food or neutraceutical (cod liver oil, EPA/DHA concentrates) or incorporated in healthy foods after refining. Major components of fish oil have positive nutritional properties. Polyunsaturated fatty acids can go up to 40 % with variable proportions of EPA (C 20 : 5) and DHA (C 22 - 6) [ω- 3 fatty acids]. Content of fat soluble vitamins is usually high. Unfortunately, fish oil is also sensitive to degradation products (polymeric and oxidized fat, increased polar content, off-flavor problems…). The beneficial nutritional properties of fish oil are in great contrast with the presence of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins and -furans (PCDDs/PCDFs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mainly originating from the environment. Usual steps for fish oil refining are neutralization, bleaching, winterization (optional) and deodorization. Processing difficulties consist in finding the best operating conditions for an effective removal of unwanted contaminants and a maximal preservation of the nutritional qualities (processing duality). In this work, different adsorbents (filter aid, silica <b>powder,</b> <b>bleaching</b> earth and active carbon) were tested for the best removal of PCDDs/PCDFs and PCBs; it was shown that filter aid, silica and bleaching earth have no significant effect on decontamination while removal of majority non ortho PCBs and PCDDs/PCDFs was possible with active carbon. Mono-ortho PCBs were significantly less absorbed by active carbon. Deodorization was further investigated. Processing temperature had a very pronounced effect on the reduction of PCDDs/PCDFs and PCBs. Already at 210 °C, all of them were removed efficiently to a level below the limit set by European Legislation. But temperature increase was limited by the risk of degradation of EPA/DHA (ω- 3). Combination of active carbon treatment and deodorization was shown to be the best compromise to remove majority of the contaminants and to preserve the nutritional quality of fish oil. At low active carbon dosage and deodorization temperature below 200 °C, the total contamination level of PCDDs/PCDFs and PCBs can be reduced below level imposed by European Legislation...|$|R
