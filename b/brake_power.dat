25|$|A railway {{air brake}} is a railway <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> braking system with {{compressed}} air as the operating medium. Modern trains {{rely upon a}} fail-safe air brake system that is based upon a design patented by George Westinghouse on March 5, 1868. The Westinghouse Air Brake Company was subsequently organized to manufacture and sell Westinghouse's invention. In various forms, it has been nearly universally adopted.|$|E
500|$|The {{class was}} absorbed by British Railways in 1948, and like their Nclass {{counterparts}} {{were given the}} power classification 4MT in 1949. Under British Railways ownership, the class was reclassified from 4MT to 4P5FB in 1953; the [...] "B" [...] denoting the <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> rating when used on unfitted (non-vacuum braked) goods trains. The locomotives at first retained their Southern Railway livery, but No.1876 was the first locomotive to emerge from Ashford works with [...] "British Railways" [...] painted on the tender in Gill Sans lettering. From 1949 to 1950 N1class locomotives were gradually repainted in the British Railways mixed-traffic lined black livery with red, cream and grey lining and the British Railways crest on the tender. Numbering was changed to the British Railways standard numbering system: the prototype became No.31822 and the 1930 batch was allocated the series 3187631880.|$|E
500|$|Initial livery after {{nationalisation}} in 1948 was British Railways {{malachite green}} and [...] "Sunshine yellow" [...] lining and lettering, with British Railways on the tender. No. 34090 Sir Eustace Missenden, Southern Railway was given commemorative malachite green livery that included green-painted wheels with yellow rims {{and the early}} British Railways crest on the tender. The Bulleid numbering system was temporarily retained on the first seventy locomotives {{with the addition of}} an [...] "s" [...] prefix (e.g. s21C101). The classes were given several power classifications in their careers, beginning with 6MT (Mixed Traffic) in 1949. In December 1953 they were reclassified 7P 5FA, the [...] "A" [...] denoting <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> when used on unfitted (non-vacuum braked) goods trains. The rebuilt locomotives retained this classification until all received the classification of 7P6F between November 1957 and November 1961.|$|E

From 1949 to 1950 Nclass locomotives were repainted in the British Railways mixed-traffic lined black livery with red, cream and grey lining and the British Railways crest on the tender. Numbering was changed to the British Railways standard numbering system: the series 3181031875 was allocated to the earlier locomotives, and 3140031414 to the final 15.|$|E
500|$|No.1 Squadron's {{complement}} {{was increased}} {{from six to}} eight aircraft after the British Air Ministry requested in February 1951 that Australia augment its bomber force to partly offset the imminent withdrawal of the RAF's Lincolns to Bomber Command in Europe. In April, No.38 Squadron's four Dakotas relocated to Kuala Lumpur, where they undertook supply drops in cooperation with No.41 Squadron RNZAF. [...] One of No.1 Squadron's Lincolns was written off after overshooting the runway at Tengah on 30November. Wing Commander (later Group Captain) Redmond Green was appointed the new commanding officer of No.90 Wing the following month, replacing Headlam. On 4April 1952, Green participated in a Lincoln sortie in place of an injured pilot. The first aircraft he took off in had to turn back owing to engine failure. The second completed the mission but {{was found to have}} lost <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> as it was returning to Tengah, and there was a danger of the aircraft overrunning the landing strip and sustaining heavy damage; the crew was able to slow the Lincoln on the runway by trailing a parachute from the rear turret upon touching down.|$|E
50|$|Brake force, {{also known}} as <b>Brake</b> <b>Power,</b> {{is a measure of}} braking power of a vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{instantaneous}} <b>braking</b> <b>power</b> is high, e.g. {{several hundred}} kW for several minutes.|$|R
25|$|The {{powertrain}} {{also provides}} regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>power</b> {{of more than}} 60kW which reduces both energy consumption and improves brake lifetime.|$|R
50|$|The brakes are air {{operated}} S-cam brakes with two circuits. The braking system {{is equipped with}} front axle <b>braking</b> <b>power</b> reducing system.|$|R
50|$|Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne derailment, {{another very}} serious railway {{accident}} caused by inadequate <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> {{on a steep}} gradient.|$|E
50|$|The main objection, however, {{was that}} it was not an {{automatic}} brake, i.e. even a minor mishap like a broken coupling left the entire train without any <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> at all.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of railways, it is {{important}} that staff are aware of the brake force of a locomotive so sufficient <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> will be available on trains, particularly heavy freight trains.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two main}} types of disc brake: [...] "mechanical" [...] (cable-actuated) and hydraulic. The {{advantages}} of cable-actuated disc brakes are in their lower cost, lower maintenance, and lighter system weight. [...] Hydraulic disc brakes, on the other hand, offer more <b>braking</b> <b>power</b> and more control over <b>braking</b> <b>power.</b> Cable-actuated were traditionally the only type of disc brake {{that could be used}} with the brake levers found on drop handlebars, but this is no longer the case.|$|R

50|$|In March 2011, models 39625, 3962, and 2206 {{received}} upgrades, {{consisting of}} ABS <b>brakes,</b> <b>power</b> steering, seat belts and the Euro-4 engine as standard equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Pedal feel - Brake {{pedal feel}} {{encompasses}} subjective perception of <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> output {{as a function}} of pedal travel. Pedal travel is influenced by the fluid displacement of the brake and other factors.|$|E
50|$|On 6 August 1975, {{locomotive}} No. 40 189 was hauling {{a freight}} train which was unable to stop {{due to a lack}} of <b>brake</b> <b>power.</b> It was in collision with another freight train at Weaver Junction, Cheshire.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the {{combined}} risks of shortage of <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> and breaking couplings, the speed of freight trains was initially restricted to 25 mph. The brake van was marshalled {{at the rear of}} the train, and served two purposes: ...|$|E

50|$|The enquiry, while {{criticizing the}} lack of <b>braking</b> <b>power</b> on such a massive train, blamed mainly the {{inadequate}} protection of the permanent way work, which should be supplemented by detonators.|$|R
50|$|On 9 October 1869 a Midland Railway {{passenger}} train {{was involved in}} a rear end collision with another train at Long Eaton Junction resulting in seven deaths and another twelve more injured. The investigation blamed fog, inadequate <b>brake</b> <b>power,</b> excessive speed, fogman error for the cause of the collision.|$|E
5000|$|The trains were loose-coupled, had no {{continuous}} brakes, {{and were}} speed-limited to 25 mi/h km/h. The lack of <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> {{was a potential}} hazard and, when approaching a downhill gradient, {{it was necessary to}} stop the train and [...] "pin down" [...] the handbrakes on some of the wagons before proceeding.|$|E
50|$|Two issues always {{added to}} <b>brake</b> <b>power,</b> {{the purpose of}} a brake van: wheels, and weight. Hence, many {{companies}} tried both approaches to improve their brake vans. Brake vans often had a significant amount of ballast, in the form of concrete, cast iron or water tanks built into their structure, to increase the available braking effort.|$|E
50|$|The DMS A {{coach has}} a {{compressor}} and main reservoir tank, which provide {{air to the}} unit via the main reservoir pipe for friction <b>braking,</b> <b>power</b> doors, secondary suspension and pantograph operation.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{standard}} axle [...] "bogies" [...] provide the drive mechanism. Each bogie {{is driven by}} 3-phase alternating current (AC) motor. A third rail provides <b>power.</b> <b>Braking</b> is either regenerative (returning electricity to the grid) with supplemental disc and (emergency) mechanical <b>braking.</b> <b>Power</b> is delivered to the vehicles using brushes or by current carrying wheels.|$|R
5000|$|The cars also {{featured}} a curved windshield, replacing the two piece windshield used on previous models. Passenger compartment heater, electric clock, <b>power</b> <b>brakes,</b> <b>power</b> steering and white sidewall tires were all available as options.|$|R

5000|$|Many British freight trains {{formerly}} had no {{continuous brake}} {{so the only}} available brakes were those on the locomotive and the brake van. Because of this shortage of <b>brake</b> <b>power,</b> the speed was restricted to 25 mph.

50|$|Circle dirt track racing In {{this class}} of racing any kind of bikes are used, most {{commonly}} a hard tail mountain bike with front suspension. Many different modifications are made to track racing bikes, such as reducing bike weight, increasing <b>brake</b> <b>power,</b> trying different cambers (so that when the bike leans the tire is more level with the track thus creating more grip), and trying different gear ratios.|$|E
5000|$|RS - [...] "rally sport" [...] Close-ratio 5-speed, minimal interior, rally suspension, 1.5 Way LSD, (Shortened {{close-ratio}} 5-speed transmission, Auto Air Conditioner, Enkei Wheels, Recaro bucket seat, Brembo <b>brakes,</b> <b>power</b> window {{are available}} as option).|$|R
