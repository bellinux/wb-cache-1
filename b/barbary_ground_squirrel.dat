50|$|The <b>Barbary</b> <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> is {{a colonial}} animal {{and lives in}} family groups in burrows in dry grassland, bushy and rocky areas {{including}} disturbed agricultural land, or in dens among rocks. It needs access to water but is not found in irrigated fields. It tends {{to come out to}} feed {{early in the morning and}} again in the evening, retreating into its burrow during the heat of the day. It feeds on plant material and a major part of its diet is the fruit and seeds of the argan tree (Argania spinosa). If the population builds up and food is scarce, the <b>Barbary</b> <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> may migrate. The females give birth to litters of up to four young, twice a year.|$|E
50|$|Xerini is a {{tribe of}} ground {{squirrels}} occurring in Africa and Asia. With the tribes Marmotini (Holarctic ground squirrels) and Protoxerini (African tree squirrels), they form the subfamily Xerinae. There are three living genera—Xerus, the African ground squirrels; Atlantoxerus, containing the living <b>Barbary</b> <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> of North Africa and some extinct species; and Spermophilopsis, containing the long-clawed ground squirrel of Central Asia.|$|E

40|$|Introduction {{of alien}} herbivores in {{sensitive}} island systems {{has resulted in}} massive effects on vegetation cover, floristic richness and composition of communities; some species can be even totally extirpated by grazing pressure. Goats Capra hircus and wild rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus were introduced in the Canary Islands around 500 B. C. <b>Barbary</b> <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> Atlantoxerus getulus were introduced in 1967. Traditional extensive livestock exploitations have been maintained to the present {{but in the last}} decades the number of goats has sharply increased up to densities of 53 heads/km 2. Overgrazing and trampling have heavily affected eleven island endemic plant species. Some populations have been reduced to less than 10 viable individuals. On the other hand, goat carcasses and wild rabbit and squirrel populations help to maintain populations of three endangered endemic subspecies of birds. This conflict presents important economic and social ramifications: whereas public funds (mainly through European LIFE projects) are devoted to conservation of plant and avian endemic taxa, the number of goats increases rapidly thanks to subventions derived from the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Similar conflicts are apparent in other Mediterranean Basin insular systems. It is urgently necessary to harmonize farming and conservation objectives in the Canary Islands. The impact of goats on the vegetation should be minimized through limitation of grazing in sensitive areas with high degree of endemism. Creation of 'vulture restaurants' may reduce the dependence of scavengers on extensive livestock exploitations. We recommend a careful study of ecological relationships within island communities where non-native species are susceptible of playing a keystonrole as occurs in the Mediterranean Basin archipelagos. © Springer 2006.

50|$|Xerospermophilus is a genus of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> in {{the family}} Sciuridae, {{containing}} four species. The members of this genus were formerly placed in the large <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> genus Spermophilus.

40|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>squirrel,</b> a hibernating {{mammalian}} species, is {{more resistant}} to ischemic brain stress than rat. Gaining insight into the adaptive mechanisms of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> may help us design treatment strategies to reduce brain damage in patients suffering ischemic stroke. To understand the anti-stress mechanisms in <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> neurons, we studied glutamate toxicity in primary cultured neurons of the Daurian <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> (Spermophilus dauricus). At the neuronal level, for the first time, we found that <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> was {{more resistant to}} glutamate excitotoxicity than rat. Mechanistically, <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> neurons displayed a similar calcium influx to the rat neurons in response to glutamate or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) perfusion. However, the rate of calcium removal in <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> neurons was markedly faster than in rat neurons. This allows <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> neurons to maintain lower level of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) upon glutamate insult. Moreover, we found that Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger (NCX) activity was higher in <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> neurons than in rat neurons. We also proved that overexpression of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> NCX 2, rather than NCX 1 or NCX 3, in rat neurons promoted neuron survival against glutamate toxicity. Taken together, our results indicate that <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> neurons are better at maintaining calcium homeostasis than rat neurons and this is likely achieved through the activity of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> NCX 2. Our findings not only reveal an adaptive mechanism of mammalian hibernators at the cellular level, but also suggest that NCX 2 of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> may have therapeutic value for suppressing brain ischemic damage...|$|R

40|$|Burrowing mammals such as <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> are {{considered}} threats to levee integrity, and some authors {{have proposed that}} <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> occurrence on levees might be reduced by habitat modification. We characterized the threat that California <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> pose to levees by summarizing available information on burrow lengths and depths, and we reviewed available information about the efficacy of habitat modification to reduce squirrel occurrence on levees. Burrows of California <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> averaged 8. 2 m in length (range = 0. 9 - 42. 1 m) and 75 cm in greatest depth (range = 33 - 168 cm), indicating that most burrows are not long enough to transect most levees but nonetheless could contribute to “piping” of water through the levee and create voids that trigger collapses of levee soil. There {{is little evidence that}} managing for either short-stature grassland or shrubby vegetation on levees will reduce occurrence of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels,</b> but further research is needed for both approaches. Managing for trees on levees likely will reduce the occurrence of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels,</b> probably because tree-covered habitats create visual obstruction that is avoided by <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels.</b> The presence of nut and fruit crops adjacent to levees increases the occurrence of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> on the levee, probably because these crops provide a rich food resource...|$|R
