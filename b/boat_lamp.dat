Wishing to impress the Archeological Society at their annual ball, Scrooge wishes for the treasure of Collie Baba, and brings the lamp and the Genie {{with him to the}} ball. He is followed by Merlock and Dijon, who violently ambush Scrooge. In the ensuing struggle, Scrooge mistakes a gravy <b>boat</b> for the <b>lamp</b> and leaves the lamp and the Genie behind, after which they both {{fall into the hands of}} Dijon, who is convinced by the Genie to keep the lamp instead of giving it to Merlock.|$|R
