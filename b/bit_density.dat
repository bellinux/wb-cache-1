2500|$|The CD-R, {{originally}} named CD Write-Once (WO), specification {{was first}} published in 1988 by Philips and Sony in the 'Orange Book'. The Orange Book consists of several parts, furnishing details of the CD-WO, CD-MO (Magneto-Optic), and CD-RW (ReWritable). The latest editions have abandoned {{the use of the term}} [...] "CD-WO" [...] in favor of [...] "CD-R", while [...] "CD-MO" [...] were used very little. [...] Written CD-Rs and CD-RWs are, in the aspect of low-level encoding and data format, fully compatible with the audio CD (Red Book CD-DA) and data CD (Yellow Book CD-ROM) standards. [...] (Note that the Yellow Book standard for CD-ROM only specifies a high-level data format and refers to the Red Book for all physical format and low-level code details, such as track pitch, linear <b>bit</b> <b>density,</b> and bitstream encoding.) [...] This means they use Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation, CIRC error correction, and, for CD-ROM, the third error correction layer defined in the Yellow Book. [...] Properly written CD-R discs on blanks of less than 80 minutes length are fully compatible with the audio CD and CD-ROM standards in all details including physical specifications. [...] 80 minute CD-R discs marginally violate the Red Book physical format specifications, and longer discs are noncompliant. [...] CD-RW discs have lower reflectivity than CD-R or pressed (non-writable) CDs and for this reason cannot meet the Red Book standard (or come close). [...] Some hardware compatible with Red Book CDs may have difficulty reading CD-Rs and, because of their lower reflectivity, especially CD-RWs. [...] To the extent that CD hardware can read extended-length discs or CD-RW discs, it is because that hardware has capability beyond the minimum required by the Red Book and Yellow Book standards (the hardware is more capable than it needs to be to bear the Compact Disc logo).|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} of data bits in magnetic recording media at ultrahigh densities is compromised by thermal `flips' [...] magnetic spin reversals [...] of nano-sized spin domains, which erase the stored information. Media that are magnetized {{perpendicular to the}} plane of the film, such as ultrathin cobalt films or multilayered structures, are more stable against thermal self-erasure than conventional memory devices. In this context, magneto-optical memories seem particularly promising for ultrahigh-density recording on portable disks, and <b>bit</b> <b>densities</b> of ∼ 100 Gbit inch^- 2 have been demonstrated using recent advances in the bit writing and reading techniques. But the roughness and mobility of the magnetic domain walls prevents closer packing of the magnetic bits, and therefore presents a challenge to reaching even higher <b>bit</b> <b>densities.</b> Here we report that the strain imposed by a linear defect in a magnetic thin film can smooth rough domain walls over regions hundreds of micrometers in size, and halt their motion. A scaling analysis of this process, based on the generic physics of disorder-controlled elastic lines, points to a simple way by which magnetic media might be prepared that can store data at densities in excess of 1 Tbit inch^- 2.

50|$|HDD data {{transfer}} rate depends upon the rotational speed of the disks and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, increasing density has become the main method to improve sequential transfer rates. Areal density (the number of bits that {{can be stored in}} a certain area of the disk) has been increased over time by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk, and the number of sectors per track. The latter will increase the {{data transfer}} rate for a given RPM speed. Improvement of {{data transfer rate}} performance is correlated to the areal density only by increasing a track's linear surface <b>bit</b> <b>density</b> (sectors per track). Simply increasing the number of tracks on a disk can affect seek times but not gross transfer rates. According to industry observers and analysts for 2011 to 2016, “The current roadmap predicts no more than a 20%/yr improvement in bit density”. Seek times have not kept up with throughput increases, which themselves have not kept up with growth in <b>bit</b> <b>density</b> and storage capacity.|$|E
