5|$|As Messi {{evolved from}} the team's {{symbolic}} captain into a genuine leader, he led Argentina to the knockout stage as group winners. In the quarter-final, they created numerous chances, including a rebound header by Messi, but were repeatedly denied by Colombia's goalkeeper, and ultimately ended the match scoreless, leading to a 5–4 penalty shootout in their favour. At the semi-final stage, Messi excelled as playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side's 6–1 victory over Paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd. Argentina started the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by Chile 4–1 in a penalty shootout after an 0–0 extra-time draw. Faced with aggression from opposing players, including taking a <b>boot</b> <b>to</b> the midriff, Messi played below his standards, though {{he was the only}} Argentine to successfully convert his penalty. At the close of the tournament, he was reportedly selected to receive the Most Valuable Player award but rejected the honour. As Argentina continued a trophy drought that began in 1993, the World Cup and Copa América defeats again brought intense criticism for Messi from Argentine media and fans.|$|E

25|$|During the play-the-ball it is {{customary}} for {{a player}} from the defending team to stand {{directly in front of}} the player playing the ball, called the marker. If no marker is present, the tackled player may tap the ball on his <b>boot</b> <b>to</b> start the next play, instead of the normally required play-the-ball. As the tap is faster to perform than the play-the-ball, giving great advantage to the attack, there is almost always a marker. Usually the person who tackled the player becomes a marker because he is the closest to the tackled player. There may be a maximum of two markers for each play-the-ball, the second standing behind the first.|$|E

The coup—with a black propaganda campaign designed to turn the population against Mosaddeq—forced Mosaddeq from office. Mosaddeq was arrested and tried for treason. Found guilty, his sentence reduced to house arrest on his family estate while his foreign minister, Hossein Fatemi, was executed.

25|$|Shortly after Mankind {{eliminated}} Rocky Maivia {{from the}} match, {{he turned his}} attention to Funk and the two started brawling with each other. This culminated in Mankind using his Cactus clothesline as Funk was against the ropes, knocking both men to the apron. Funk came back into the ring and tried to suplex Mankind, who reversed the maneuver and suplexed Funk over the rope, eliminating him. Mankind did not leave the apron, however, and Undertaker eliminated him with a <b>boot</b> <b>to</b> the floor. Funk then began arguing with the officials {{on the side of the}} ring from which he had been eliminated, and Mankind responded by attacking him to restart the brawl.

25|$|The next {{match was}} the SmackDown!/ECW Elimination Chamber match between The Undertaker, Batista, Big Daddy V (with Matt Striker), Finlay, The Great Khali (with Ranjin Singh) and Montel Vontavious Porter. Batista and Undertaker were {{selected}} to start the match. Undertaker gained control of the match early after tossing Batista over the top rope onto the chamber's steel surface. In the ring, both men were knocked down by delivering a big <b>boot</b> <b>to</b> each other. The third entrant, Big Daddy V, then entered, and dominated both The Undertaker and Batista for some time, until Batista performed a Spinebuster on Big Daddy V. Shortly after, The Undertaker executed a DDT on the steel floor of the chamber on Big Daddy V and Batista pinned him, thus eliminating him. The fourth entrant was The Great Khali, who also dominated upon entering, but was eliminated when he submitted to Gogoplata submission hold. The fifth entrant was Finlay, who gained the advantage over Batista by tossing him into the steel chains of the chamber, and over Undertaker by delivering a Celtic Cross {{to him for a}} near-fall. Finlay also slammed Undertaker's head into a pod, breaking it and causing Undertaker to start bleeding. The sixth entrant, MVP, was attacked by Undertaker when his pod was opened. MVP used a steel chain as a weapon on the other three competitors, until he {{climbed to the top of}} a pod. Undertaker followed and delivered a chokeslam to MVP from the top of the pod onto the ring, which cost MVP the match as Finlay pinned MVP and eliminated him. Later, Hornswoggle passed a shillelagh to Finlay from under the ring, which he used on both Batista and Undertaker. He was soon eliminated by Undertaker who pinned him after a Chokeslam onto the chamber floor. The final two men were Batista and Undertaker.
