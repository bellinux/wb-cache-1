50|$|Explorer II was {{a pistol}} {{version of the}} AR-7. It resembled a Broomhandle Mauser. The {{receiver}} had a built-in pistol grip with no provision for the rifle stock (the internal parts are interchangeable between rifle and pistol). The rear sight of the pistol was an open notch adjustable for windage and elevation. The Explorer II front sight was integral with the <b>barrel</b> <b>shell</b> and was not adjustable. The magazine well {{in front of the}} trigger guard would accept any magazine designed for the rifle. A spare 8-round magazine could be carried inside the grip. The most common barrel was six inches.

In this article, we examine the local stiffness of individual vaults and probe their structural stability with atomic force microscopy under physiological conditions. Our data show that the barrel, {{the central part of}} the vault, governs both the stiffness and mechanical strength of these particles. In addition, we induce single-protein fractures in the <b>barrel</b> <b>shell</b> and monitor their temporal evolution. Our high-resolution atomic force microscopy topographies show that these fractures occur along the contacts between two major vault proteins and disappear over time. This unprecedented systematic self-healing mechanism, which enables these particles to reversibly adapt to certain geometric constraints, might help vaults safely pass through the nuclear pore complex and potentiate their role as self-reparable nanocontainers...|$|E

40|$|The {{modern era}} of thin {{concrete}} shells began in 1922 {{with the construction}} of a 52 -ft-diameter (16 -m), 1. 2 -in. -thick (30 -mm) reinforced concrete dome in Jena, Germany. 1 This revolutionary structure resulted from a collaboration between Walter Bauersfeld, of the German optical company Zeiss, and Franz Dischinger, of the German engineering firm Dyckerhoff and Widmann. Their design and construction technique was introduced to the U. S. by Anton Tedesko, another Dyckerhoff and Widmann engineer. In 1936, while consulting with the Chicago firm of Roberts and Schaefer, Tedesko designed the first large thin concrete shell in the U. S. : a 232 -ft (71 -m) span, 340 -ft-long (104 -m) <b>barrel</b> <b>shell</b> for an ice hockey arena in Hershey, PA. 1 In the three decades following the introduction of thin shells in the U. S., a number of innovative designers, such as Pier Luigi Nervi (Fig. 1), Eduardo Torroja, Vasilii Vlassov, and Felix Candela (Fig. 2), advanced {{the state of the art}} by introducing new design theories and construction techniques and experimenting with shells of different forms. It was during this time that a variety of landmark shells of double curvature, such as hyperbolic and elliptical paraboloids, were constructed (Fig. 3 and 4). Based on the number and variety of shells built from the 1920 s to the early 1960 s, this period can be considere...|$|E

50|$|The {{detachable}} barrel {{is locked}} in place with a dowel at the receiver and a nut at the magazine tube. The barrel and chamber are chrome-coated for increased durability and corrosion protection. The chamber is sealed by rotating the sealing wedge, which locks into the port in the shank of the barrel. Its trigger mechanism is located on a detachable mounting plate. Cartridges are fed from a tubular magazine under the <b>barrel,</b> and <b>shells</b> are ejected {{from the side of}} the receiver. The forearm is located on the magazine, and is connected to the slide frame by two action bars. A blocking lever blocks the forearm when the hammer is cocked.

40|$|Shells are objects {{considered}} as materialization of the curved surface. Despite structural advantages and architectural aesthetics possessed by shells, relative degree of unacquaintance with shell behavior and design is high. Thin shells {{are examples of}} strength through form as opposed to strength through mass; their thin cross-section makes them economical due to low consumption of cement and steel as compared to other roof coverings such as slabs. Current study presents design curves for reinforced concrete open <b>barrel</b> cylindrical <b>shells</b> for different geometric parameters. The analysis is done in two parts namely: i) RC shell subjected to uniformly distributed load that remain constant along its length and curvature of the shell surface; and ii) RC shell subjected to uniformly distributed load varying sinusoidally along its length in addition to different symmetric edge loads present along its longitudinal boundaries. Design charts are proposed for easier solution of shell constants after due verification of results obtained from finite element analysis. Expressions for stress resultants proposed in closed form make the design more simple and straightforward; stress resultants plotted at closer intervals of φ can be useful for detailing of reinforcement layout in RC shells. Axial force-bending moment yield interaction studied on shells under uniformly distributed loads show compression failure, initiating crushing of concrete...|$|R

40|$|Just after World-War II {{building}} materials were scarce, architects and engineers had to design buildings using not much cement and steel. In French an architect, Jacques Couëlle, had invented {{a system with}} céramique infill elements to reduce for structures of concrete the self-weight and need of cement and steel. In the fifties and sixties {{of the twentieth century}} these céramique elements, known as Fusée Céramique elements, were used widely in France, North Africa and the Netherlands, mostly for <b>barrel</b> vaults and <b>shells.</b> Nowadays most of these structures are pulled down and the remaining buildings do not meet the demands of the present concerning climate comfort, insulation and safety. This thesis analyses the structural design of cylindrical Fusée Céramique roofs in the context of those days. The effect of the céramique infill elements for the time dependent deformations, stiffness and load bearing capacity, including second order, is studied. To save the few remaining buildings for the coming generations the possibilities to strengthen these structures with slender light elements of steel are explored. The effect of the strengthening is described for a Fusée Céramique vault, designed and constructed in the past. Reinforced concrete is a widely used building material with many advantages. Unfortunately the production of both reinforcement and cement is quite energy intensive and causes the emission of greenhouse gasses as NO 2, NO and CO 2. Reducing the need of cement is a relative simple way to reduce the emission of these greenhouse gasses. In practice roofs are seldom really flat but curved or at least slightly inclined, to drain rainwater and snow. Structurally curved structures, transferring loads as a surface-active or form-active structural system, are very efficient. The need of material and the self-weight is pretty low. This can be very useful if in the future the potentials of roofs for producing food and energy are used more often and these roofs must be designed for much heavier payloads as usual at the present. For form-active and surface-active roofs of concrete the self-weight and need of steel and cement can be reduced further with light infill elements. This study of the Fusée Céramique system shows that infill elements can save cement, self-weight and reduce the environmental load. The possibilities to save cement and reduce the environmental load with infill elements are studied with respect to the construction techniques of the present. The design of prefabricated cylindrical vaults, composed of segments following a part of a circle and strengthened with slender ties of steel to reduce the bending stresses, is described. To produce prefabricated cylindrical barrel vaults efficiently a positioning of tubes perpendicular to the span is preferable. The effect of this infill concerning the load transfer is analysed. Models of a prefabricated element, with tubes positioned perpendicular to the span, are tested to define the structural bearing capacity of prefabricated barrel vaults...|$|R
