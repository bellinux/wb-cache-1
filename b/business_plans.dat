25|$|The {{autonomy}} of the local corporations, however, remained limited. Important decisions such as the approval of tariff increases, investment decisions, and {{the selection of the}} General Manager of each Local Corporation still required the approval of the central government. Investments are financed by foreign grants channeled through the central government. Furthermore, the Boards of the local corporations often did not play an active role. For example, in Ibb the Board met infrequently, did not discuss the corporation's accounts and was reluctant to even discuss a tariff increase. In 2009 a study recommended to transform local corporations into public companies with clear <b>business</b> <b>plans</b> and more autonomy, but this recommendation was not implemented.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to deliver}} {{insights}} into the field of structuring a <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> for start-up companies and implementing an efficient risk analysis {{in the course of}} <b>business</b> <b>planning.</b> In order to achieve this goal, this thesis challenges the theory with practice to equally reflect both perspectives. The theoretical part first reviews the literature dealing with <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> outlines and, then, presents the author's own systematic methodology to the risk analysis in <b>business</b> <b>planning.</b> The empirical part provides a real-life example of a structured <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> where the risk analysis concept designed by the author is applied.

The risk analysis in a <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> increases its transparency and credibility and, therefore, it should be considered for its inherent part. The application of the risk analysis across the <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> shall follow a systematic approach, which is an adapted version of official risk management standards.
