40|$|The EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), {{from the}} beginning, {{has evolved over}} time. In its last updates, it {{promotes}} the <b>best</b> <b>environmental</b> management <b>practices</b> {{through the development of}} the Sectoral Reference Documents (SRDs) that have to be taken into consideration by the EMAS-registered organizations in assessing their environmental performance. Many organizations and companies have a wide margin to improve their environmental performance. With the aim to improve their eco-efficiency and thus its reputation and the sustainability of their business, many companies want to lower their impact on the environment. To help organizations achieve this goal, the CCR identifies, evaluates, and documents <b>best</b> <b>environmental</b> management <b>practices</b> (BEMPs) for the different sectors, in collaboration with stakeholders. The results of this work are the Sectoral Reference Documents (SRDs) on <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> in <b>environmental</b> management. This activity is part of the European Commission’s work to implement the system of EU management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), a voluntary framework for enterprises and other organizations to evaluate, report, and improve their environmental performance.

30|$|Effective {{regulatory}} frameworks {{are needed}} to protect soils from further pollution input of POPs and other pollutants. Such a framework needs to regulate air emissions from industries and incinerators and should {{require the use of}} best available techniques and <b>best</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>practice</b> (BAT/BEP) for such facilities as stipulated by Article 5 of the Stockholm Convention. In addition, the amendment of soils with contaminated sludge, ashes or sediment needs to be avoided and restricted. To achieve such a protection, regulatory frames such as a regulation for fertilizer and other materials used for soil amendment is needed. The German fertilizer regulation includes limits for some POPs including PCDD/Fs, PCBs and PFOS. The limit for applying fertilizer to pasture land is 8  ng TEQ/kg dm for the sum of PCDD/Fs and PCBs [283].|$|R

Some thirty years ago, in the southwest of France, a group of farmers decided to improve their farming methods, as well as developing new <b>Best</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Practices,</b> such as grass strips along streams and riparian forests. By combining the use of ELECTRE TRI-C multi-criteria model with a GIS, we were able to characterise the contribution of each farming area to the risk of surface water contamination with pesticides.

30|$|The {{situation}} {{in developing countries}} is different. While PCDD/Fs are considered {{within the framework of}} the Stockholm Convention and PCDD/F inventories have been developed in most developing countries, the release of PCDD/Fs has not been reduced due to the lack of improved waste management measures as well as the lack of capacity and funding to implement best available techniques and <b>best</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>practice</b> (BAT/BEP) in industries. A range of updated PCDD/F inventories in developing countries even show an increase in PCDD/F release due to increased consumption and release in uncontrolled incineration processes such as open waste burning [291, 296]. In addition to landfill fires, waste is often burned in backyards and along streets where chicken, goats and cattle forage for food, leading to exposures. Large areas are at risk of becoming contaminated over time leading to exposure, similar to the Campania region in Italy [239].|$|R

40|$|Palm {{oil mill}} has been {{regarded}} as a profit making industry for the past decades. Besides revenue from the palm oil production itself, the abundance of biomass could generate high economic return to the palm oils mill by converting it to value added products. However, the palm oil industry currently suffered various criticisms and negative reports from the international non-government organizations on the environmental issue. This paper presents the development and the applicability of environmental index (EI) for palm oil mill {{in order to enhance}} the competitiveness of the industry. The methodology will include the index development and identify area of weaknesses (hotspot). The index will be able to identify performance of the mills in Environmental aspect against benchmarks and differentiate every mills performance. By this, the mills can easily identify its hotspot and take necessary steps to improve. The system will also benefit the marketing team to market its products (CPO, PKO etc.) to niche markets that seek uptake from mills with lowest footprints (Carbon, water, energy etc.). The results can be used not only to evaluate the performance of an operating process against standard benchmarking but also to establish the <b>best</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> among palm oil industry. It is anticipated that the development of environmental index will be an important instrument for supporting sustainable operation for palm oil mill...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{important}} new mines have been opened in Finland (Suurikuusikko, Talvivaara) while existing ones have upscaled their operations and new mining projects have been started. The mining industry produces the raw materials on which many other industries depend, including the metal, chemical and pulp and paper industries, as well as agriculture {{and a number of}} other sectors. Unavoidably, the metal ore mining has impacts on the environment. Prevention of negative environmental impacts calls for the application of BAT (Best Available Techniques) in the mining, starting from ore prospecting and mine planning and extending to mine closure - throughout the mine life cycle. This publication discusses the environmental aspects of metal ore mines throughout the mine life cycle, ranging from the relevant legislation, emissions and environmental impacts of the mining, to the required environmental surveys, methods and techniques used to decrease emissions and diminish environmental impacts. With Finnish conditions in focus, the publication proposes latest solution models for the <b>best</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> for the metal ore mining. The publication is a joint project between the Geological Survey of Finland, the Kainuu and Lapland Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment, the Regional State Administrative Agency for Northern Finland, the Finnish Association of Extractive Resources Industry and the Finnish Environment Institute. The publication is intended to use in planning, implementing and closing of the mines for operators and permit and supervisory authorities, as well as for consultants...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores {{through a}} case study on a broader and more {{specific}} basis, the historic and more recent development of sustainable management and natural resource practices of a prominent coastal tourism region in Australia, and a representative example of an accredited marine ecotourism operator within that region who has been applying policies and management practices in sustainable marine wildlife tourism. The paper includes the growth and development of marine wildlife tourism {{with an emphasis on}} the region as well as further development of marine wildlife-based sustainable management practices. This also involves a detailed discussion of the practices aboard the enterprise Imagine Cruises, and the visitor experience in attempting to provide <b>best</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>practices</b> and in turn offer positive wildlife and environmental management tactics in contributing in the short term to the sustainability of the dolphin and whale watch industry which operates within the bay and the coastal and marine areas of Port Stephens. The historical development of marine-based and land-based sustainable management policies and practices in Port Stephens are examined in the paper, in a region which has rapidly become a major tourism destination based on abundance of cetacean wildlife, natural attributes and proximity to Sydney, Australia. Through the case review of the historical development of the Port Stephens environment, wildlife conservation and the focus on preservation of the rich natural resources of the region coupled with the advancement and implementation of sustainable policies and practices in nature-based wildlife tourism and especially the cetacean tourism industry, these can be conveyed as factors of importance in the further development of sustainable marine wildlife practices regionally, nationally and potentially influencing decision making on an international level...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an account of}} a questionnaire-based study of {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) and their responses to the current requirements of <b>environmental</b> <b>best</b> <b>practice.</b> The study was based within South Yorkshire. We aim to explore the current relationship between SMEs and the environment and how this affects their concept of `sustainable business'. The main finding reported is that most manufacturing and service organisations surveyed believe environmental issues affect their business. However, meeting environmental requirements is seen as a business cost that is not transferable to customers in terms of added benefits and few organisations could show that it led to a competitive advantage. SMEs have only a generalist awareness of environmental legislation, and information provided by most local support services is not presented in a format that is efficient or effective. Our recommendations are that the assistance provided by local support agencies with regards to <b>environmental</b> <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> should be critically reviewed, and this review should seek to understand the reluctance and real difficulties faced by SMEs in comprehension and implementation of environmental legislation. This paper should therefore be used in conjunction with associated information when considering the best way to help prepare SMEs for greater involvement in <b>environmental</b> <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> and the achievement of sustainable business...|$|R
