50|$|The two central houses, numbers 10 and 11, have a paired {{entrance}} {{with four}} Tuscan columns with a cornice and frieze above them. The central point between {{the windows of}} the first floor has a <b>blind</b> <b>niche.</b>|$|E
50|$|An open {{pediment}} in {{the upper}} fa√ßade is topped by a small cupola. The curvilinear shape of the pediment serves as a graceful finish to the upward movement of the pilasters and the arch entrance. The <b>blind</b> <b>niche,</b> urn-shaped pinnacles and even proportions-overlooking at the top are decorative devices of the upward movement.|$|E
50|$|The best {{preserved}} {{exterior wall}} {{is on the}} southeast side with the main gate made from carefully cut bunter sandstone ashlars to which the drawbridge used to lead. Witnesses thereof are a deep, <b>blind</b> <b>niche,</b> which frames the ogival arch of the gateway and used to house the drawbridge, and the still visible roller holes for the chains. Above the portal are two, angled coats of arms whose details were probably destroyed by French soldiers in 1794. They used to depict the arms of Frederick of Saarwerden and probably the Archbishopric of Cologne.|$|E
50|$|The gateway {{is built}} in red {{sandstone}} with gables {{to the front}} and rear. The west face has a central arch for vehicles and a smaller arch to the south for pedestrians. On each side of the central arch is a <b>blind</b> <b>niche.</b> In the upper storey is a 16-pane window in a Gothic arch. On the east face is one arch, larger than that on the west face. In the upper storey is a central window in a Gothic arch with a rectangular window on each side. In the gable end is another Gothic-shaped window. To the south of the arch is a diminishing turret containing an arched doorway with a small window above it.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} main banking room {{is one of}} {{the best}} preserved monumental banking rooms of its day in the Allentown region. The room occupies the full width of the front wing, and extends back beyond the elevator core. At the rear it is spanned by a balcony that marks the full two stories of the room. The balcony is accented by a <b>blind</b> <b>niche</b> framed by engaged piers and consoles. The room itself is surrounded by a deep, dentillated cornice, similar to that of the exterior, which with the arcaded walls completes the sense of a monumental masonry space common to major banks. One final touch of note are a pair of handsome Art Deco bronze chandeliers with fluted sides that are suspended from the ceiling at each end of the room.|$|E
