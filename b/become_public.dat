5|$|In 1910, {{graduates}} of state-run Shinto schools, such as Kokugakuin University and Kougakkan University, were implicitly allowed to <b>become</b> <b>public</b> school teachers. A {{greater number of}} better-trained priests with educations at state-supported schools, combined with a rising patriotic fervor, is believed by some to have seeded {{an environment in which}} grassroots Emperor worship was possible, even without financial support for local shrines.|$|E
5|$|In January 1531, Campeggio was {{dismissed}} as cardinal protector, {{although it did}} not <b>become</b> <b>public</b> knowledge until May. At first {{it was unclear whether}} Henry VIII intended to appoint a successor, with Giovanni Domenico de Cupis emerging as an active candidate in March 1532. The king favoured Alessandro Farnese (future Pope Paul III), and instructed his ambassadors on 21 March to offer it to Farnese, and then de Cupis or Giovanni del Monte (future Pope Julius III) in the event that Farnese declined or was not approved.|$|E
5|$|Only {{a single}} known {{case of fraud}} {{involving}} a record submitted to BBRC has <b>become</b> <b>public.</b> In autumn 1994, Nigel Pepper, a birdwatcher from Essex, claimed to have recorded a hermit thrush in a garden in Chipping Ongar. Doubts about the record were raised in Birdwatch and BBRC reviewed the record in 2002, but decided that it should stand. In 2009, Pepper revealed in Birdwatch magazine (Birdwatch 204: 46-47) that the record was a deception, made in protest at perceived secrecy surrounding rare birds in the county.|$|E

5|$|Acheson was {{particularly}} worried that allowing {{the details of}} the coup to go public would damage the image of the US. The Rio Pact of 1947 had created the Organization of American States, or OAS, and this body had obtained jurisdiction over regional disputes from the United Nations. In order to achieve this, the US had also committed to a policy of non-intervention {{in the internal affairs of}} other countries. If PBFORTUNE had <b>become</b> <b>public</b> knowledge, the fact that the US was supporting an invasion of a country that was also a member of the OAS would have represented a huge setback to US policy. Thus the State Department promptly ended the operation when they became aware that its cover was blown.|$|E
5|$|Another {{prominent}} {{opponent of}} the Theses was Johann Eck, Luther's friend and a theologian at the University of Ingolstadt. Eck wrote a refutation, intended for the Bishop of Eichstätt, entitled the Obelisks. This was {{in reference to the}} obelisks used to mark heretical passages in texts in the Middle Ages. It was a harsh and unexpected personal attack, charging Luther with heresy and stupidity. Luther responded privately with the Asterisks, titled after the asterisk marks then used to highlight important texts. Luther's response was angry and he expressed the opinion that Eck did not understand the matter on which he wrote. The dispute between Luther and Eck would <b>become</b> <b>public</b> in the 1519 Leipzig Debate.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Bryce {{reported}} that, between 1894 and 1908, {{mortality rates}} at some residential schools in western Canada ranged from 30% to 60% {{over five years}} (that is, five years after entry, 30% to 60% of students had died, or 6–12% per annum). These statistics did not <b>become</b> <b>public</b> until 1922, when Bryce, who was no longer working for the government, published The Story of a National Crime: Being a Record of the Health Conditions of the Indians of Canada from 1904 to 1921. In particular, he alleged that the high mortality rates {{could have been avoided}} if healthy children had not been exposed to children with tuberculosis. At the time, no antibiotic had been identified to treat the disease, and this exacerbated the impact of the illness. Streptomycin, the first effective treatment, was not introduced until 1943.|$|E

Sex with a person under 16 years of age constitutes third degree rape under Oregon law, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. By the time the relationship had <b>become</b> <b>public,</b> however, the statute of limitations had expired, making Goldschmidt immune from any prosecution over the matter.|$|E
5|$|Thrum's Hawaiian Almanac and Annual for 1883 {{reported}} Kalākaua's tour expense {{appropriated by}} the government as $22,500, although his personal correspondence indicates he exceeded that early on, and exact tallies of the trip are not known. Any non-government private expenses or debts would not necessarily have <b>become</b> <b>public.</b> In a letter to Liliuokalani in June, the King stated they were already in danger of running out of funds to complete the trip, and that money was owed to Italy {{for the education of}} the young men who had been entrusted to Moreno. The many awards and decorations he bestowed during the trip cost the kingdom more money.|$|E
5|$|Jill {{begins to}} work for {{cosmetics}} company Jabot and its owner, John Abbott (Jerry Douglas), promotes her to head of merchandising, impressed by her work. They become involved, but she cheated on him with his son, Jack Abbott (Terry Lester). John dumped her and she filed a sexual harassment suit worth $10,000 against Jack when {{he will not be}} with her. She reunites with John and they married in 1982. However, Abbott family housekeeper, Mamie Johnson (Veronica Redd), seemed to be a thorn in Jill's new marriage. Mamie, who wants to protect John, kept and eye on Jill, who had another affair with Jack. Katherine gets a hold of pictures of Jack and Jill and showed them to John, who has a stroke. Jill divorced John in 1986 and gets 20% of Jabot in their settlement, and a seat {{on the board of directors}} after threatening to sell her story turning it into a novel or film. Jill strives at her business, but is later found in her shower having been shot, just as her son Phillip returned to town after years away at boarding school. The three main suspects in the shooting are John, Jack, and Katherine. Jack confesses so that his affair with her won't <b>become</b> <b>public.</b> The real culprit is Sven, a masseur at the Genoa City Hotel. He had been rejected by Jill earlier in the night and shot her after getting drunk. Sven kidnaped Jill and locked her in a meat freezer. Jack rescued her and Sven escaped. Jill and Katherine fight over her son Phillip, who is now a teenager and had a past of acting out. Phillip turned to alcoholism but quit with help from Jill and Katherine. Phillip has sex with Nina Webster (Tricia Cast) and she ends up pregnant. He later died after driving under the influence, devastating both women. Jill hired a former con man Rex Sterling (Quinn Redeker) to seduce Katherine. Rex's real name was Brian Romalotti, father of Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian) and Gina Roma (Patty Weaver). He married Katherine, but Jill then wanted Rex for herself and convinced him to divorce Katherine. In reality, Katherine had been replaced by a look alike Marge Cotrooke who pushed Rex away. He divorced her, and married Jill, but the real Katherine finally returned and reunited with Rex. Rex eventually was shot and killed while Jill began romancing John again.|$|E
