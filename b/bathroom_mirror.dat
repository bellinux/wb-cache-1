25|$|The River Mole flows nearby. As {{its name}} suggests, {{the river in}} places goes {{underground}} due to the chalk bed being dissolved, forming swallow holes (sinkholes). Ian Middleton tells of his father, sometime in the 1950s, the village police officer P.C. Middleton, looking past his <b>bathroom</b> <b>mirror</b> one morning whilst shaving to see a mature oak tree disappear into the ground. It {{turned out that the}} river flowing underground had been gradually wearing away the supporting ground under the tree, forming a giant such hole which had collapsed. The subsequent pit was not filled in until about 1968 approx when it was still 30ft deep and 30ft across. P.C. Middleton also reportedly removed parts from an unexploded V2 rocket which fell in the village during World War II.|$|E

When Myriam entered the office, Lhermitte told her to sit on a chair and wear a blue handkerchief over her eyes. Once Myriam was seated, Lhermitte took a marble plaque she found nearby and smashed it over Myriam's head, and then cut her throat. Nora, who was allegedly Dr. Schaar's favorite goddaughter, was asked to sit in a chair while Lhermitte slit her throat from behind.

The game {{turns out to be}} carom billiards, not pool. When Eddie loses badly, Bert refuses to keep staking him. Sarah pleads with Eddie to leave with her, saying that the world he is living in and its inhabitants are [...] "perverted, twisted, and crippled"; he refuses. Seeing Eddie's anger, Bert agrees to let the match continue at $1,000 a game. Eddie comes back to win $12,000. He collects his $3,000 share and decides to walk back to the hotel. Bert arrives first and subjects Sarah to a humiliating sexual encounter.

40|$|Suggesting that {{bathrooms}} in film {{are primarily}} theorized as transgressive spaces of violence, vulnerability, disorder and disturbing acts, Glen Donnar&# 039;s work adopts a different stance, focusing on {{encounters with the}} self and/as other in <b>bathroom</b> <b>mirrors,</b> whereby the <b>bathroom</b> arguably becomes a space of revelation albeit one which discloses inadequacy, difference and transformation. His chapter explores the many contradictory significances of domestic <b>bathrooms</b> and <b>mirrors</b> for younger men across key depictions from and of the 1980 s in American film. The simultaneously physical and metaphorical, real and unreal characteristics of the <b>mirror</b> disturb <b>bathroom</b> and male protagonist alike, {{in large part because}} of its ambivalent capacity to both reveal and distort. Donnar considers the filmic bathroom finally a revelatory, heterotopic space that can neither conceal nor contain male inadequacy, shame or monstrosity confirmed through the mirrored encounter of the self...|$|R
5000|$|McGrath, {{whose father}} was from New Zealand, was born in Sydney where he was educated at the Fort Street Boys School, and studied {{painting}} at the Julian Ashton School. In 1921 he enrolled in the Faculty of Arts at Sydney University but subsequently transferred to the School of Architecture. In 1924 he published, in a limited edition of 30 copies on Japanese vellum, a book of woodcut illustrations and poetry entitled The Seven Songs of Meadow Lane. McGrath graduated in 1926 Bachelor of Architecture with first class honours and as {{the winner of the}} Wentworth travelling scholarship. This allowed him to move to London where he studied at the Westminster School of Art before taking up a fellowship at Clare College, Cambridge. [...] While at Clare, Mansfield Forbes had McGrath redecorate the interior of the College's house Finella, a large Victorian house on the Cambridge backs, now belonging to Gonville and Caius College. McGrath's bold modernist remodelling of Finella made adventurous use of materials, with copper-clad doors, an aluminium-walled <b>bathroom,</b> <b>mirrored</b> ceilings and a rubberised floor decorated with Pictish motifs.|$|R
500|$|Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank: Chosen {{out of six}} {{unwanted}} pregnancies and {{the first}} child to be legally adopted by a corporation, Truman is unaware that his daily life is broadcast continuously around the world. He has {{a job in the}} insurance business and a lovely wife, but he eventually notices that his environment is not what it seems to be. Robin Williams was considered for the role, but Weir cast Carrey after seeing him in [...] because Carrey's performance reminded him of Charlie Chaplin. Carrey took the opportunity to proclaim himself as a dramatic actor, rather than being typecast in comedic roles. Carrey, who was then normally paid $20 million per film, agreed to do The Truman Show for $12 million. Carrey and Weir initially found working together on set difficult (Carrey's contract gave him the power to demand rewrites), but Weir was impressed with Carrey's improvisational skills, and the two became more interactive. The scene in which Truman declares [...] "this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy" [...] to the <b>bathroom</b> <b>mirror</b> was Carrey's idea.|$|E

5000|$|Overhearing Mary Feur (Miranda Otto) sobbing one day, Claire becomes {{concerned}} when Mary tells her she is afraid she may disappear. When she sees Mary's husband Warren (James Remar), {{a colleague of}} Norman's at the college, dragging a suspicious form {{in the middle of}} the night and putting it in the trunk of his car, she suspects he has killed Mary. Claire decides to investigate. After nobody answers the door, Claire soon witnesses strange occurrences when she is alone in the house and becomes convinced that Mary is dead and haunting her. Desperate to reach Mary's spirit, Claire invites her friend Jody (Diana Scarwid) to join her for a séance in her bathroom. The séance provides no results except for the dog scaring them, so Jody leaves after Claire confides that Norman treats her like a child due to her car accident a year before and the recent departure of their daughter. Claire then cleans out the bathroom, but then returns to it with a full bath tub and a steamy message on the <b>bathroom's</b> <b>mirror</b> that reads [...] "You know". Hysterical, Claire runs downstairs to get the phone when the computer (that turned on by itself after she went upstairs earlier) begins to type [...] "MEF" [...] over and over. Terrified, she then runs to her husband's office at the college where he accuses her of attempting to sabotage his career. She denies it, but then realizes that Warren is there and she confronts him only to find that Mary is with him and alive. Mary visits her the next day and apologizes for the misunderstanding, explaining that she briefly left her husband because of their volatile fights with each other. Claire returns to the therapist she recently began seeing.|$|R

Though he is outwardly chivalrous, his more perverted tendencies inevitably drive away his date over his pleading objections. For instance, he invites the woman to wash up in his bathroom; once she is inside, it becomes obvious that the <b>bathroom</b> <b>mirror</b> is a two-way mirror when he is seen lighting up a cigarette.

5000|$|Tiffany Farrell: Tiffany is Luann's nemesis, a {{physically}} attractive, but shallow and arrogant cheerleader who constantly insults and belittles Luann at every moment. Her {{best friend is}} Crystal. It was hinted that Luann and Tiffany might have been friends in elementary school, but that changed once they got to Junior High. Luann and Tiffany often battle for the attentions of various boys, with Luann almost always coming out on top. In March 2003, Luann and Tiffany formed a brief friendship after winning a volleyball game as a team, but it fell apart due to their ongoing rivalry over Aaron. Tiffany used her cell phone camera {{to take a picture}} of Luann changing in the girls locker room. Initially, she tried to blackmail Luann, but when Luann would not cooperate, Tiffany posted the photo on the internet, embarrassing Luann. With Gunther's help, Luann was able to prove Tiffany took the photo by revealing her reflection in Luann's locker door mirror, causing her to be suspended. In January 2008, her title of Miss Chamber of Commerce was revoked due to her role in TJ's catering scheme to sell meals in fire stations. In January 2009, she helped Luann in a donation to have Delta accompany them to Washington, DC (since Delta would have been unable to go due to the fund of the trip being not enough and one student (Delta) was cut out); Tiffany's help was short-lived since she got tired of being dunked in a dunk tank (the donation's main event). In 2011, she staged a school beauty pageant, which was won by Rosa. The proceeds from the pageant paid for new <b>bathroom</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Despite liking attractive boys, Tiffany mentions to Crystal that she never had an actual boyfriend. However, in 2015, she developed a physical attraction to Gunther, her [...] "study buddy." ...|$|R
