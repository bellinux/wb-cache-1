5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Nablus {{came under}} Jordanian control. Thousands of Palestinian {{refugees}} fleeing from areas captured by Israel arrived in Nablus, settling {{in refugee camps}} {{in and around the}} city. Its population doubled and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city's resources. Three such camps still located within the city limits today are Ein Beit al-Ma', <b>Balata</b> and Askar. During the Jordanian period, the adjacent villages of Rafidia, <b>Balata</b> al-Balad, al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality. The 1967 Six-Day War ended in the Israeli occupation of Nablus. Many Israeli settlements were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s. The restrictions placed on Nablus during the First Intifada were met by a back-to-the-land movement to secure self-sufficiency, and had a notable outcome in boosting local agricultural production.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of 20 September, Chauvel's {{communications}} with his cavalry divisions, were limited to wireless and aircraft. The last aerial reconnaissance on 20 September reported three large fires burning at Nablus railway station, fires burning at the <b>Balata</b> dumps, and the whole Ottoman front line from El Lubban to the Jordan alarmed. They also reported a brigade of British cavalry entering Beisan.|$|E

5|$|On 14 June 827, {{the allied}} fleets sailed from the Bay of Sousse, and {{after three days}} they reached Mazara in southwestern Sicily, where they landed. There they were met with {{soldiers}} loyal to Euphemius, but the alliance soon began to show rifts: a Muslim detachment mistook some of Euphemius' partisans for loyalist troops, and a skirmish ensued. Although Euphemius' troops were ordered to place a twig on their helmets as a distinctive mark, Asad announced his intention to wage the campaign without them. Soon after that, <b>Balata,</b> {{who seems to have}} taken over the functions, if not the title, of the imperial strategos on the island, appeared nearby with a Byzantine force. The two armies clashed on a plain south-east of Mazara, where Asad's men, after exhortations by their leader, gained a victory. <b>Balata</b> retreated first to Enna and from there to Calabria on the Italian mainland, where he may have hoped to gather more troops. Instead, he died there shortly after his arrival.|$|E
5|$|The 5th Light Horse Brigade {{with the}} 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery, had {{advanced}} quickly along the Tulkarm-to-Nablus road {{to attack the}} last resistance outside Nablus and capture the town, between 800 and 900 prisoners and two field guns. The Régiment Mixte de Marche de Cavalerie, with two armoured cars, entered Nablus while the 14th Light Horse Regiment linked with the 29th and 30th Brigades (10th Division, XX Corps) at <b>Balata.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hans-Martin Schenke, {{starting}} from {{an analysis of}} , in which Jesus encounters a Samaritan woman at the town Sychar, made an extensive analysis of the ancient sources, together with {{an examination of the}} site. The curiosity of the Gospel text for scholars lies in the mention of an otherwise unattested town in the field, and the failure of the text to refer to Joseph's Tomb, despite mentioning the field Jacob allotted to Joseph, and Jacob's well. In Schenke's view, {{from the beginning of the}} Hellenistic period down to the 1st century CE, when the author of John's gospel was presumably writing, the grave commemorating Joseph stood by Jacob's Well. This grave was shifted, together with the sacred tree and Jacob's field, sometime between that date and the earliest testimony we have in the Bordeaux itinerary in 333 CE., which locates it elsewhere, by Shechem/Tel <b>Balāṭa.</b>|$|E

It finally ends with {{the entrance to the}} rotunda along with Panganiban Drive and Maharlika Highway.|$|R
50|$|Archbishop Pedro P. Santos {{noted that}} the devotees and pilgrims kept {{increasing}} through the years. In 1960, he dreamt of building a basilica to give honor to Our Lady. Shortly after, through the meditation of the Archbishop Emeritus Teopisto V.

5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of 19 September, {{it was clear that}} the breakthrough attacks in the Battle of Sharon by the XXI Corps had been successful, and the XX Corps was ordered to begin the Battle of Nablus by attacking the well-defended Ottoman front line, supported by an artillery barrage. These attacks continued late into the night and throughout the next day, until the early hours of 21 September when the continuing successful flanking attack by the XXI Corps, combined with the XX Corps assault and aerial bombing attacks, forced the Seventh and Eighth Armies to disengage. The Ottoman Seventh Army retreated from the Nablus area down the Wadi el Fara road towards the Jordan River, aiming to cross at the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, leaving a rearguard to defend Nablus. The town was captured by the XX Corps and the 5th Light Horse Brigade, while devastating aerial bombing of the Wadi el Fara road, blocked that line of retreat. As all objectives had now been won, no further attacks were required of the XX Corps, which captured thousands of prisoners in the area and at Nablus and <b>Balata.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several aerial combats {{occurred}} over Tul Keram, Bireh, Nablus and Jenin on 16 July and attacked a transport column of camels near Arrabe, a train north of Ramin and three Albatros scouts aircraft {{on the ground}} at <b>Balata</b> aerodrome. Near Amman 200 cavalry and 2,000 camels which had been attacked a few days previously, were again attacked, and two Albatros scouts were destroyed during aerial combat over the Wady el Auja.|$|E
25|$|The Washington Post {{commented that}} Israeli policy of {{targeted}} killing during the Second Intifada expanded upon previous policies, targeting not only terrorists {{but also those}} thought to direct or coordinate them. Another controversial killing, which occurred following the Bush Administration's condemnation of the practice, was that of Mahmoud Madani, a leader of Hamas shot while leaving a mosque in the <b>Balata</b> refugee camp. The Israeli military suspected Madani of plotting bombings in Israel.|$|E

6000|$|Nay, to {{this day}} there is one point in our cathedral which, to me, keeps up the {{illusion}} still. As I enter the choir, and look upward toward the left, I cannot help seeing, in the tabernacle work of the stalls, the slender and aspiring forms of the [...] "rastrajo;" [...] the delicate second growth which, as it were, rushes upward from the earth wherever the forest is cleared; and above it, in the tall lines of the north-west pier of the tower--even though defaced, along the inner face of the western arch, by ugly and needless perpendicular panelling--I seem to see the stems of huge cedars, or <b>balatas,</b> or ceibas, curving over, as they would do, into the great beams of the transept roof, some seventy feet above the ground.|$|R
60|$|But {{there were}} warm hearts and kind faces waiting {{us on the}} quay, and good news too. The gentlemen at the Custom-house courteously {{declined}} the least inspection of our luggage; and we were at once away in the train home. At first, I must confess, an English winter was a change for the worse. Fine old oaks and beeches looked to us, fresh from ceibas and <b>balatas,</b> like leafless brooms stuck into the ground by their handles; while the want of light was for some days painful and depressing But we had done it; and within the three months, as we promised. As the king in the old play says, 'What has been, has been, and I've had my hour.' At last we had seen it; and we could not unsee it. We could not {{not have been in}} the Tropics.|$|R
25|$|After the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, the West Bank was annexed by Jordan (1950), and archaeological {{excavations}} in {{the region}} were carried out by its Department of Antiquities, as had been the case throughout the British Mandate in Palestine. Made up of Muslim and Christian officials and headed by the British archaeologist Gerald Lankaster Harding until 1956, field archaeology was conducted primarily by foreigners. Large-scale expeditions included those of the American Schools of Oriental Research at Tell <b>Balata</b> (1956–1964), the British School of Archaeology at Jericho (1952–1958), and the École Biblique at Tell el-Farah (1946–1960) and Khirbet Qumran (1951–1956). Rising nationalistic pressures led to Harding's dismissal in 1956 and thereafter, the Department of Antiquities was headed by Jordanian nationals.|$|E
25|$|On Martinique, {{the storm}} struck {{the east side}} of the island at about 6:00 pm. Throughout the storm, {{frequent}} lightning occurred. Houses, crops and trees across the entire island were obliterated. Especially, the loss of coffee, sugar and cotton crops had a large effect on Martinique's economy. At Ducos, it is noted that only four homes remained following the storm, and at St. Pierre, at least 34people lost their lives. At Fort de France, the main part of the hospital collapsed, crushing to death two artillery men. Also, a military camp in <b>Balata</b> was destroyed, where houses comprising the campus suffered from severe roof damage. A number of soldiers there sustained injuries from airborne wood blanks and beams. All vessels at harbors were lost during the hurricane.|$|E
25|$|Of all the West Bank towns, the IDF General Staff was {{particularly}} concerned about the expected resistance in Nablus, and especially in its Casbah. Hamas and Fatah had launched dozens of suicide bombers. Despite a previous successful raid on <b>Balata,</b> the General Staff still estimated hundreds of armed men would be entrenched in the city, causing the IDF heavy casualties. Two days {{after the start of}} Defensive Shield, an extension of the operation north of Ramallah, to Nablus and Jenin, was approved. Originally, the mission was given to a reserve division, but was later transferred to the more experienced West Bank Division. The division's commander, Brigadier General Yitzhak Gershon, received two regular infantry brigades, the Paratroopers Brigade and the Golani Brigade, along with a reserve armored division. A private contractor allowed the commander of the Paratroopers 890th battalion to use a construction site for training for three days. There was a near-mutiny among one reserve armored platoon, who claimed they were not properly trained for urban warfare. High ranking armor officers eventually talked them into joining the operation.|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} based on glycemic index was suggested in selecting foods for the diabetes patients. A study on glycemic index of selected tuber foods {{has been conducted}} to provide Glycemic Index (GI) of the foods. The tubers including Taro (Xanthosoma violaceum SCHOOT), Yam (Dioscorea aculeata LINN), edible canna (Canna edulis KER), arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea LINN) and sweet potato (Ipomoea <b>balatas</b> POIR) were selected. The foods were analyzed for total sugar and starch after streaming. Ten volunteers (21 - 23 years old) of the nurse 2 ̆ 7 s students of the Panti Rapih Hospital Yogyakarta were provided. They took a night fasting and the blood sample was taken in the next morning. The food tested was given and blood sample was taken at 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after meal. Glucose level of the blood was measured and drawn graphically. GI was measured as the area under the postpradial blood glucose curve for a food expressed {{as a percentage of}} the area after the consumption of reference food (bread).

6000|$|When {{inside the}} Cocal, {{the air is}} full of this amber light. [...] Gradually the eye {{analyses}} the cause of it, and finds {{it to be the}} resultant of many other hues, from bright vermilion to bright green. [...] Above, the latticed light which breaks between and over the innumerable leaflets of the fruit fronds comes down in warmest green. It passes not over merely, but through, the semi-transparent straw and amber of the older leaves. It falls on yellow spadices and flowers, and rich brown spathes, and on great bunches of green nuts, to acquire from them more yellow yet; for each fruit-stalk and each flower-scale {{at the base of the}} nut is veined and tipped with bright orange. It pours down the stems, semi-gray on one side, then yellow, and then, on the opposite side, covered with a powdery lichen varying in colour from orange up to clear vermilion, and spreads itself over a floor of yellow sand and brown fallen nuts, and the only vegetation of which, in general, is a long crawling Echites, with pairs of large cream-white flowers. Thus the transparent shade is flooded with gold. One looks out through it at the chequer-work of blue sky, all the more intense from its contrast; or at a long whirl of white surf and gray spray; or, turning the eyes inland toward the lagoon, at dark masses of mangrove, above which rise, black and awful, the dying <b>balatas,</b> stag-headed, blasted, tottering to their fall; and all as through an atmosphere of Rhine wine, or from the inside of a topaz.|$|R
60|$|Through the Palmiste pillars; {{through the}} usual black Roseau scrub; then under tangled boughs {{down a steep}} stony bank; and {{we were on a}} long beach of deep sand and quartz gravel. On our right the Shore- grapes with their green bunches of fruit, the Mahauts {226} with their poplar-like leaves and great yellow flowers, and the {{ubiquitous}} Matapalos, fringed the shore. On our left weltered a broad waste of plunging foam; in front green mountains were piled on mountains, blazing in sunlight, yet softened and shrouded by an air saturated with steam and salt. We waded our horses over the mouth of the little Yarra, which hurried down through the sand, brown and foul from the lagoon above. We sat down on bare polished logs, which floods had carried from the hills above, and ate and drank-- for our Negroes had by now rejoined us; and then scrambled up the shore back again, and into a trace running along the low cliff, even more beautiful, if possible, than that which we had followed in the morning. Along the cliff tall <b>Balatas</b> and Palmistes, with here and there an equally tall Cedar, and on the inside bank a green wall of Balisiers, with leaves full fifteen feet long and heads of scarlet flowers, marked the richness of the soil. Here and there, too, a Cannon-ball tree rose, grand and strange, among the Balatas; and in one place the ground was strewn with large white flowers, whose peculiar shape told us at once of some other Lecythid tree high overhead. These Lecythids are peculiar to the hottest parts of South America; to the valleys of the Orinoco and Amazon; to Trinidad, as a fragment of the old Orinocquan land, and possibly to some of the southern Antilles. So now, as we are in their home, it may be worth our while to pause a little round these strange and noble forms.|$|R
500|$|Crusader {{and medieval}} sources {{generally}} are, according to Hans-Martin Schenke, highly misleading regarding {{exactly where the}} tomb was situated. He concluded that in the Middle Ages, as earlier, various groups (Jews, Samaritans, Christians and Moslems) at different periods identified different things in different places all as Joseph’s tomb [...] Sometimes <b>Balata,</b> with its spring, seems indicated, as in the following two examples, which identify the tomb not as a structure, but as something by a spring and under a tree. It was evidently a site for Muslim pilgrimage at that time.|$|E
500|$|From {{the start}} of the Second Intifada, Nablus became a {{flash-point}} of clashes between the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Palestinians. The city has a tradition of political activism, as evinced by its nickname, jabal al-nar (Fire Mountain), and, located between two mountains, was closed off {{at both ends of the}} valley by Israeli checkpoints. For several years, movements in and out of the city were highly restricted. The city and the refugee camps of <b>Balata</b> and Askar constituted the center of [...] "knowhow" [...] for the production and operation of the rockets in the West Bank.|$|E
500|$|Joseph's Tomb ( [...] , Qever Yosef, , Qabr Yūsuf) is a funerary {{monument}} {{located at}} the eastern entrance to the valley that separates Mounts Gerizim and Ebal, 300 metres northwest of Jacob's Well, {{on the outskirts of}} the West Bank city of Nablus, near Tell <b>Balata,</b> the site of Shakmu in the Late Bronze Age and later biblical Shechem. One biblical tradition identifies the general area of Shechem as the resting-place of the biblical patriarch Joseph, and his two sons Ephraim and Manasseh. Multiple locations over the years have been viewed as the legendary burial place of Joseph.|$|E
6000|$|What will be {{the future}} of {{agriculture}} in the West Indian colonies I of course dare not guess. The profits of sugar-growing, {{in spite of all}} drawbacks, have been of late very great. They will be greater still under the improved methods of manufacture which will be employed now that the sugar duties have been at least rationally reformed by Mr. Lowe. And therefore, for some time to come, capital will naturally flow towards sugar-planting; and great sheets of the forest will be, too probably, ruthlessly and wastefully swept away to make room for canes. And yet one must ask, regretfully, are there no other cultures save that of cane which will yield a fair, even an ample, return, to men of small capital and energetic habits? [...] What of the culture of bamboo for paper-fibre, of which I have spoken already? It has been, I understand, taken up successfully in Jamaica, to supply the United States' paper market. Why should it not be taken up in Trinidad? Why should not Plantain-meal {318a} be hereafter largely exported {{for the use of the}} English working classes? Why should not Trinidad, and other islands, export fruits- -preserved fruits especially? Surely such a trade might be profitable, if only a quarter as much care were taken in the West Indies as is taken in England to improve the varieties by selection and culture; and care taken also not to spoil the preserves, as now, for the English market, by swamping them with sugar or sling. Can nothing be done in growing the oil-producing seeds with which the Tropics abound, and for which a demand is rising in England, if it be only for use about machinery? Nothing, too, toward growing drugs for the home market? Nothing toward using the treasures of gutta- percha which are now wasting in the <b>Balatas?</b> Above all, can nothing be done to increase the yield of the cacao-farms, and the quality of Trinidad cacao? ...|$|R
