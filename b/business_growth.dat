5|$|Carrick {{is a small}} {{historic}} {{village that}} is primarily a residential settlement for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. Development has been slow and has not changed the town's original 19th century character. The local council's development plan aims to restrict development along Meander Valley road and prevent the merging of Carrick and Hadspen, keeping them as distinct centres. Construction is only planned within the town's boundary, where up to sixty homes could potentially be built under the strategic plan that runs until 2016. The town's development boundary is dictated by the span of sewerage connection. There are few businesses in the town and little incentive for <b>business</b> <b>growth</b> due to the town's small population. The town is in the Meander Valley Council local government area, the Federal Division of Lyons, and the State Division of Lyons.|$|E
5|$|Youngstown's downtown, {{which once}} underscored the community's {{economic}} difficulties, is {{a site of}} new <b>business</b> <b>growth.</b> The Youngstown Business Incubator (YBI), {{in the heart of}} the downtown, houses several start-up technology companies that have received office space, furnishings, and access to utilities. Some companies supported by the incubator have earned recognition, and a few are starting to outgrow their current space. One such company–Turning Technologies–has been rated by Inc. Magazine as the fastest-growing privately held software company in the United States and 18th fastest-growing privately held company overall. In an effort to keep such companies downtown, the YBI secured approval to demolish a row of vacant buildings nearby to clear space for expansion. The project will be funded by a $2 million federal grant awarded in 2006. In 2014, the YBI was ranked as the number 1 university associated business incubator in the world by the Swedish UBII (University Business Incubator Index). In 2015, the YBI was the top University Associated Incubator in North America, and came in second to the Dublin Enterprise & Technology Centre, also known as the Guinness Enterprise Centre, in Dublin.|$|E
