5|$|Using her {{influence}} at The Miami Herald, Douglas wrote columns about poverty: You {{can have}} the most <b>beautiful</b> <b>city</b> {{in the world as}} appearance goes, the streets may be clean and shining, the avenues broad and tree lined, the public buildings dignified, adequate and well kept... {{but if you have a}} weak or inadequate health department, or a public opinion lax on the subject, all the splendors of your city will have not value. In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Committee, with a friend of hers named Elizabeth Virrick, who was horrified to learn that no running water or sewers were connected to the racially segregated part of Coconut Grove. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs. In the two years it took them to get the referendum passed, they worked to set up a loan operation for the black residents of Coconut Grove, who borrowed the money interest-free to pay for the plumbing work. Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.|$|E

25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1921, Snively became a {{candidate}} for mayor of Duluth, was elected, and kept the position {{for a total of}} sixteen years--a record for Duluth mayors. Snively was sixty-one years old when {{he was elected to the}} office, and his first proclamation as mayor was his promise to make Duluth the most <b>beautiful</b> <b>city</b> in the Northwest, if not the country. The completion and promotion of Skyline Parkway, the city's hilltop boulevard, became Snively's personal project throughout his four terms in office. The idea for the city-wide boulevard is credited to William King Rogers of Ohio, who also oversaw construction of its initial segment from 1889 to 1891. After that, work on the boulevard fell off, and was piecemeal at best until Snively came into office. During his administration, the boulevard's expansion served as both a way to beautify the city and provide jobs during tough economic times in the 1930s.|$|E
