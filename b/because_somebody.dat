Due to the vested {{interest}} of the King (who would hold the lands) the actual lunacy or idiocy was determined by a jury, not by an individual judge. Under the Lunacy Act 1845 the Lord Chancellor {{had a right to}} appoint a commission to investigate the insanity of an individual; as part of his role as Keeper of the King's conscience, however, he would only do this when it was beneficial to the lunatic, not simply <b>because</b> <b>somebody</b> had been found insane.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{join the}} {{investigation}} at McKesson’s home. Scully suggests {{a connection between}} the burned body of Ariel McKesson who disappeared in 1956 and her mother, the latest victim. Scully believes that the burned body should be exhumed to potentially learn the connection with the other deaths. Later, the gravediggers already have the coffin excavated when Detective Abbott shows up at the town cemetery.

[...] Five days later, however, an article from The Crescent-News (based in Hornish's birthplace of Defiance, Ohio) quoted Hornish as saying, [...] "I'm still working on something to race in good equipment. Possibilities still exist for this year, but there were a couple of different opportunities that didn't pan out <b>because</b> <b>somebody</b> else brought money to the table." ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{character}} departure was Smalljon Umber, {{played by}} Dean S. Jagger. In an interview, Jagger {{talked about his}} casting: [...] "I prayed for it. When I heard I got the part my knees buckled. It was a life-changing moment." [...] Before becoming a professional actor, Jagger dug trenches and worked at a mattress factory to pay his way through acting school and was a professional rollerblader. Ian Whyte also made his last appearance in [...] "Battle of the Bastards" [...] as the giant, Wun Wun; he had played Gregor Clegane during the show's second season. Special-effects supervisor Joe Bauer said about Whyte's casting as Wun Wun, [...] "We wanted a large performer <b>because</b> <b>somebody</b> who would be 14, 15 feet tall would have more weight and mass to move around, and a person who's a normal size would have {{a very difficult time}} pulling that off".|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} {{the promotion of}} his previous studio album El Rock de Mi Pueblo (2004), Vives ended his music contract with EMI Latin and took a hiatus, for concentrating on supporting local artists as a producer and songwriter. He then met Juanita Santos, the president of Rafael Pombo Foundation, who asked them to present {{a proposal for a}} musical that uses the most iconic poems and fables created by Pombo. Motivated by this, they began to study many books about Pombo and his works. The creation of Pombo Musical began as a studio project in house between old friends, Carlos Ivan Medina, Carlos Huertas and Ernesto [...] "Teto" [...] Ocampo. He stated: [...] "Before we worked musically on some of Rafael Pombo's works, without thinking about making a record, but <b>because</b> <b>somebody</b> had done a melody of Rin Rin". Together with Medina, Vives made a melody for [...] "Modelo Alfabético". On July 24, 2008, Vives released [...] "El Modelo Alfabético", a song based on a poem by Pombo, with influences of cumbia and rock as the album's lead single.|$|E
500|$|On March 13, 2006, Hayes {{announced}} that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices." [...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement. Later in an interview on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, [...] "Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not like that. I know that's your thing, but get your information correct, <b>because</b> <b>somebody</b> might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing.

They sign it <b>because</b> <b>somebody's</b> asked them to sign it." [...] As to the JCPOA Zinni said: [...] "The agreement's fine, if you think it can work.

2500|$|In {{response}} to criticism contending René shouldn't expose {{images of a}} vagina to children, he explains that in this context children wouldn't {{even know what it}} is, and, if they did know, it's because someone else has already shown them what it is. [...] "If the kid recognizes it as something bad — obscene, disgusting — it's <b>because</b> <b>somebody</b> put this idea into his head already." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kelly {{confirmed}} {{the authenticity of}} the pre-stop police audio, in which one officer reports that the driver resembled a recent robbery suspect due to his [...] "wide-set nose." [...] The particular robbery to which the officer referred was unclear, but may have been a July 2 armed robbery at a local convenience store, in which the two suspects were [...] "described as black men with shoulder-length or longer dreadlocks" [...] with no information about estimated height, weight or ages. Goins said, [...] "I can't imagine that it's reasonable suspicion to make a stop <b>because</b> <b>somebody</b> had a broad nose." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for The A.V. Club on January 4, 2006, Hayes was again asked about the episode. He said that he told the creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, [...] "Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not like that. I know that’s your thing, but get your information correct, <b>because</b> <b>somebody</b> might believe that shit, you know?" [...] He then told them {{to take a couple}} of Scientology courses to understand what they do. [...] In the interview, Hayes defended South Park's style of controversial humor, noting that he was not pleased with the show's treatment of Scientology, but conceding that he [...] "understands what Matt and Trey are doing." ...|$|E

[...] "I know that [...] only <b>because</b> <b>somebody</b> has mentioned that, too, already," [...] he told reporters at the time. However, it was later revealed that Ryun and Foley had hosted a joint fundraiser on their street on May 18, 2006, called the [...] "D Street Block Party."

2500|$|SP4 Frederick J. Widmer – Assistant Radiotelephone Operator; Widmer, who {{has been}} the subject of pointed blame, is quoted as saying, [...] "The most {{disturbing}} thing I saw was one boy—and this was something that, you know, this is what haunts me from the whole, the whole ordeal down there. And there was a boy with his arm shot off, shot up half, half hanging on and he just had this bewildered look in his face and like, 'What did I do, what's wrong?' He was just, you know, it's, it's hard to describe, couldn't comprehend.

Jeanette says she has to keep her daughter indoors {{to protect her from}} the dangers in their community. When asked what she worried about, she replied: Just too much killing, innocent kids being shot and being killed, just because they wanted to be outside, you know what I'm saying. It was frightening for your child to go outside. I did used to keep her in because I was just that paranoid, because that's a terrible feeling for your only child to be hurt like that. Likewise, Kathy said the kids in her neighborhood had to hide from the constant shooting. She explained in detail the problems in her neighborhood: Like, sometimes we'll be outside and just hear some gunshots—it be an ugly sight, because you shouldn't—you shouldn't—your kids have to, you know what I'm saying, get up and run from where you live, you know what I'm saying, where you pay rent at just <b>because</b> <b>somebody’s</b> going to act ignorant. 1 A central goal of U.

Once the news surfaced that band members Redfoo and SkyBlu had split, the group went to MTV News to set the record straight. SkyBlu said, [...] "Well, you know, first of all, we're not breaking up.

2500|$|Top-ranked LSU {{defeated}} sixth-ranked, rival Ole Miss, 14–0 {{in a game}} {{dominated by}} defense and penalties. 68,000 fans packed Tiger Stadium to watch the Tigers win their first game against the Rebels since 1950. Ole Miss was LSU's most bitter rival at the time, and fans who heard and read about the Chinese Bandits and Billy Cannon wanted to see them first-hand. [...] "It's not a rivalry <b>because</b> <b>somebody</b> says it is," [...] said Cannon, [...] "or because you've been playing against a team for a long time. It's a rivalry when two good teams meet and either one could walk out the winner. This was a rivalry." [...] Banners were strung around the LSU campus with the words [...] "Go to Hell, Ole Miss." [...] Later, a plane dropped leaflets on campus that read [...] "Go to Hell, LSU."

2500|$|For {{the role}} of the evil Asa and her {{innocent}} descendant Katia, Bava noted: [...] "A strange type was needed, and we chose Steele from pictures." [...] Bava reportedly found Steele difficult to work with. According to Bava, the actress [...] "was somewhat irrational, afraid of Italians. One day she refused to come to the set, <b>because</b> <b>somebody</b> told her I was using a special film-stock that made people appear naked." [...] Steele recalled: [...] "Lord alone knows I was difficult enough. I didn't like my fangs – I had them changed three times. I loathed my wig – I changed that four times. I couldn't understand Italian. I certainly didn't want to allow them to tear open my dress and expose my breasts, so they got a double that I didn't like at all, so I ended up doing it myself – drunk, barely over eighteen, embarrassed and not very easy to be around." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an August 2013 interview, Anson Mount (Cullen Bohannon) {{discussed}} {{the scene with}} the seemingly young daughter (Siobhan Williams, who is actually 23) in the barn: [...] "The network almost made us cut that sex scene out, and we fought for it to stay in. I'm not interested in pure, untainted heroes, just like I'm not that interested in strength. I'm interested in weakness, and I'm interested in what makes <b>somebody</b> human. Just <b>because</b> <b>somebody's</b> had their heart broken doesn't mean that they don't get a hard on every now and then. Okay. It's just realistic. He's out there alone. The only thing he's seen is whores, and half of 'em have syphilis. What's he gonna do?" [...] He added, [...] "The reason the sex is so important in that scene {{is that he has}} to hang her brother the next day and he doesn't even question it. He has {{to get on with the}} railroad. The law is the law. It makes the killing of that boy much more difficult, but he does it. We also had a scene in that episode in which I was reading to her little sister before she went to bed. We didn't have room for it, unfortunately, but that's the kind of stuff that we were trying to set up to make that ending so much more difficult." ...|$|R

5000|$|In the mid-1970s, as Pink Floyd gained {{mainstream}} fame, Waters began feeling increasingly {{alienated from}} their audiences:Audiences at those vast concerts {{are there for}} an excitement which, I think, {{has to do with}} the love of success. When a band or a person becomes an idol, it can have to do with the success that that person manifests, not the quality of work he produces. You don't become a fanatic <b>because</b> <b>somebody's</b> work is good, you become a fanatic to be touched vicariously by their glamour and fame. Stars—film stars, rock 'n' roll stars—represent, in myth anyway, the life as we'd all like to live it. They seem at the very centre of life. And that's why audiences still spend large sums of money at concerts where they are a long, long way from the stage, where they are often very uncomfortable, and where the sound is often very bad.Waters was also dismayed by the [...] "executive approach", which was only about success, not even attempting to get acquainted with the actual persons of whom the band was comprised (addressed in an earlier song from Wish You Were Here, [...] "Have a Cigar"). The concept of the wall, along with the decision to name the lead character [...] "Pink", partly grew out of that approach, combined with the issue of the growing alienation between the band and their fans. This symbolised a new era for rock bands, as Pink Floyd [...] "explored (... the hard realities of 'being where we are'", drawing upon existentialists, namely Jean-Paul Sartre.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, Knight reprised {{the role}} of Ruth in Pirates with the Lyric Opera of Chicago. [...] Chicago radio host Bruce Duffie, {{interviewing}} Knight after seeing that production noted, [...] "Gillian Knight {{is one of those}} great personalities who simply go about their business season after season, giving splendid renditions of various roles, and adding luster to their home companies while not going far afield very often and, thus, passing up the opportunity for real world-wide stardom". During that interview, Knight said, [...] "I'm getting a bit controversial here, but there is a snobbish attitude towards Gilbert and Sullivan in the opera world.... I believe in excellence. [...] Now I believe that if Gilbert and Sullivan is done well... then it is excellent, and it should be in a [...] house". [...] She advised audiences, [...] "Don't close your mind to anything <b>because</b> <b>somebody</b> has said, 'Oh, this is Gilbert and Sullivan,' or, 'This is modern music.'

2500|$|In 2002, {{the band}} signed {{with a small}} New York record company called A Touch of Class for a two-single deal. Their first single [...] "Electrobix" [...] dealt with gay men's obsessions with working out but proved to be less popular than its B-side, a cover version of Pink Floyd's {{progressive}} rock classic [...] "Comfortably Numb". Matronic commented, [...] "It's one of those songs that people were either gonna love or hate, and that's really, really powerful, because it basically means you're evoking a reaction in everyone. The first time I heard it, I thought that if it doesn't make us famous, it'll make us infamous <b>because</b> <b>somebody</b> will shoot us!" [...] Their version of [...] "Comfortably Numb" [...] became a hit in many dance clubs and, after sending Pink Floyd themselves a copy, the Scissor Sisters received positive remarks from the song's original writers Roger Waters and David Gilmour. The song proved to be particularly popular in the UK, where various record labels soon {{took an interest in}} the band. In 2003, they decided they would tour Europe where they believed audiences would be more receptive of them and their music than their native US.|$|E

In New Mexico, DeVille's wife Lisa committed suicide by hanging; DeVille discovered her body. He said:I got {{in a car accident}} because I got crazy. I think I was somewhat taunting death <b>because</b> <b>somebody</b> who I loved very much died. And I found them.

I was in love with another woman and we were going through some hard times, and I got in the car and I wanted to go off the cliff. I was in the mountains in New Mexico... They came right around the corner head on. You know how big a Dodge Ram truck is? I broke my arm in three places and my knee went into the dash board... It was bone to bone...
