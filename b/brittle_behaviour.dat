However, amorphous polymers exhibit <b>brittle</b> <b>behaviour</b> under impact, especially if the component is notched or is too thick relative to a corner radius. The occurrence of brittle failure can be decreased by: increasing the molecular weight, inclusion of rubber phase, inducing orientation in the polymer and reducing internal defects and contaminants.|$|E

The <b>brittle</b> <b>behaviour</b> seems {{to be associated with}} rate dependent weakening of the constitutive parameters (commonly expressed as velocity dependent frictional state variables) and some form of chemical healing of damage that has resulted from the <b>brittle</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The deformation process is exothermic (in the extreme case producing pseudotachylite melts) and involves the generation of dilatancy. The heat generated during deformation together with dilatancy influences the fluid pore pressure in the deforming rock mass.|$|E

A series of numerical analyses incorporating <b>brittle</b> material <b>behaviour</b> has been undertaken, specifically considering deep-seated first-time failure of cuttings in weathered London Clay. Because of progressive failure, the average mobilised strength is between the peak bulk strength and the residual strength. In current practice, parameter selection is often based on Chandler and Skempton's back-analysis of several deep-seated failures in the brown weathered London Clay. This paper considers variation of the critical (minimum) height for delayed deep-seated failure in cuttings in weathered London Clay with slope angle, and variation of mobilised strength with cutting heigh...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{response}} of a two-dimensional liquid foam to a localized air injection is investigated experimentally and theoretically. The experiments show a rich phenomenology, with two essentially distinct behaviours, {{depending on the}} injection conditions. At low flux, the injected air forms a central bubble that grows inside the foam and induces plastic rearrangements, without film rupture. This 'pure swelling' regime is reminiscent of ductile fracture. In this regime, the central bubble shows fingering patterns beyond a certain velocity. The dependence among the swelling rate, the injection overpressure and the other control parameters, namely cell gap, bubble size and foam area, is captured by a simple balance between the pressure drop and bubble/wall friction under a radial assumption. Fingering is successfully modelled by the linear stability analysis of an azimuthal perturbation of the radial model; yield stress becomes an important parameter to determine the finger width. At high injection rate, films are broken and narrow cracks form rapidly through the foam, reminiscent of brittle fracture. Criteria for the transition between ductile and <b>brittle</b> <b>behaviours</b> are investigated, both at the local and global scales...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} into the cause and consequences of an observed <b>brittle</b> <b>behaviour</b> of some starter bars on a construction site in the Netherlands. A few bars suddenly failed when they were bent in order to align them. For the investigation firstly a batch of starter bars that possibly exhibited the same <b>brittle</b> <b>behaviour</b> was traced using a bending test. Both a parameter related to the applied manufacturing process and the nitrogen content of the starter bars, were used to distinguish between probable brittle and ductile starter bars. The fatigue behaviour of the brittle starter bars as well as the ductility of the connection in which these starter bars were used, were investigated experimentally. The fatigue life appeared to be reduced and brittle failures were also observed in the connection where the starter bars are loaded in tension. It could be demonstrated that the structure in which these starter bars were used, still satisfies the requirements. Since the observed <b>brittle</b> <b>behaviour</b> can not be detected by the tests according to the current Dutch Approval Guideline, it is recommended to add an additional bending test, which might be defined using the results of this investigation...|$|E

Summary Discrete Element Method (DEM) is a powerful tool as a digital sandbox simulator to numerically reproduce fault related structures and to analyse the deformation quantitatively. Similar to analogue sandbox experiments, DEM approximates the geologic body as an assembly of particles that can properly simulate the <b>brittle</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the upper crust. We examined the collision process of the Indian sub-continent to the Eurasian Plate by using the DEM. The simulations reproduced the deformation geometry similar to published analogue experiments. Velocity and stresses of each particle extracted from the simulation were quite unstable showing a characteristic feature of the <b>brittle</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the upper crust. A comparison of these results with GPS and in-situ stress data of the eastern Asia suggests that the ductile deformation of the lower crust and mantle may have major roles to control the real deformation. The results also suggest that Tapponnier’s tectonic model may have a strong boundary effect, particularly to the stress field within the model...|$|E
40|$|Concrete has {{the lowest}} ratio between cost and {{strength}} as compared to others available materials and hence {{it is still the}} most widely used materials in construction. However, the <b>brittle</b> <b>behaviours</b> of concrete has affected the reliability and durability of structures. So, steel fibres are suggested adding into conventional concrete to improve the structural behaviours. The structural behaviours of two-span continuous steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) beam were studied in present investigation using non-linear finite-element analysis. Finite element program, Abaqus was adopted to perform the finite element analysis of present investigation. The effects of steel fibres in concrete were modelled by SFRC constitutive model proposed by Lok and Xiao (1999). Initially, the validation and calibration works FE predictions were performed by using experimental results. After the good correlation among FE predictions and experimental results were achieved, parametric modelling was carried out using by two key parameter; stirrups spacing (i. e. stirrups spacing increment, SI) and fibre contents (i. e. volume fraction, Vj). The settings were designed to examine the potential of steel fibres to serve as a part of stirrups. Beside these, other key structural parameter included strength, ductility, cracking propagation and modes of failure were determined through the investigation. The findings showed that the mentioned structural behaviours of beam were improved by inclusion of steel fibres significantly at an optimum amount of fibres dosage...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that better {{understanding}} of events at the tool-workpiece interface will lead to better definition of the boundary conditions for the process models. The deformation of the oxide scale {{on the surface of}} steel being hot worked contributes to the interface complexity. This scale has a complicated microstructure, and can deform or fracture. In hot rolling, the deformation of the scale begins before the steel makes contact with the roll, under the influence of a tensile stress as the roll draws the metal into the roll gap. Tension tests under controlled conditions have been used to simulate this initial deformation and have revealed ductile and <b>brittle</b> <b>behaviour,</b> according to the operating conditions. This behaviour is also very sensitive to small changes in the chemical composition of the underlying steel. This is illustrated for two low-carbon steels. The laboratory observations are complemented by finite element modelling of the tensile deformation, which is capable of reproducing both ductile and <b>brittle</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the oxide scale with the same model. The model is adjusted to mimic the effect of changing the chemical composition of the steel...|$|E

The {{addition of}} fibres, either short or continuous, changes its <b>brittle</b> <b>behaviour</b> to ductile or quasi-ductile with significant improvement in tensile strength, tensile strain, toughness and energy absorption capacities. The binder in the fibre reinforced cement composites (FRCCs) is mainly Portland cement. The recent environmental awareness in construction industry promotes the use of alternative binders to partially or fully replace the cement as its production creates environmental pollution due to release of CO 2 into atmosphere. Recent years have seen a great development in new types of inorganic cementitious binders called “geopolymeric cement” around the world. This prompted its use in concrete, which improves the greenness of ordinary concrete.
