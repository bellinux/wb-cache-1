It can be observed that an interdiffusion region existed between the filler metal and the base metal for the <b>brazed</b> <b>joint</b> of Ni-based filler metals.

The {{results indicate that the}} massive microstructure is granular and fine when Al content is under 15 wt. % in the cast microstructure of Zn-xAl filler metal. Meanwhile, the drawability {{properties of}} the filler metal is excellent. Thus, the massive microstructure become dendritic and coarse when Al content exceeds 15 wt. %. At the same time, the drawability properties of the filler metal become bad. In the microstructure of the <b>brazed</b> <b>joint,</b> the interface layer exists in the interface between the Cu base metal and the brazed seam. The interface layer is mainly consisted of Cu 9 Al 4 and CuAl IMCs. When Al content is under 15 wt. %, the interface layer shape is a visibly serrated edge, so the adhesive strength between the interface layer and the brazed seam is higher and the mechanical property of the <b>brazed</b> <b>joint</b> is excellent.

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{disadvantages}} {{is the lack of}} joint strength as compared to a welded joint due to the softer filler metals used. The strength of the brazed joint is likely to be less than that of the base metal(s) but greater than the filler metal. Another disadvantage is that <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> can be damaged under high service temperatures. <b>Brazed</b> <b>joints</b> require a high degree of base-metal cleanliness when done in an industrial setting.

40|$|The Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) {{consists}} of 1080 conical tubes, which are furnace brazed themselves, manifolds, and surrounding structural jacket making almost four miles of <b>braze</b> <b>joints.</b> Subsequent furnace <b>braze</b> cycles are performed due to localized braze voids between the coolant tubes. SSME nozzle experiences extremely high heat flux (180 mW/sq m) during hot fire. Braze voids between coolant tubes {{may result in}} hot combustion gas escape causing jacket bulges. The nozzle can be disqualified for flight or result in mission failure if the braze voids exceed the limits. Localized braze processes were considered to eliminate braze voids, however, damage to the parent materials often prohibited use of such process. Being the only manned flight reusable rocket engine, it has stringent requirement on the braze process. Poor braze quality or damage to the parent materials limits the nozzle service life. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a laser brazing process to provide quality, localized <b>braze</b> <b>joints</b> without adverse affect on the parent materials. Gold (Au-Cu-Ni-Pd-Mn) based high temperature braze alloys were used in both powder and wire form. Thin section iron base superalloy A 286 tube was used as substrate materials. Different Laser Systems including CO 2 (10. 6 micrometers, 1 kW), ND:YAG (1. 06 micrometers, 4 kW). and direct diode laser (808 nm. 150 W) were investigated for brazing process. The laser process variables including wavelength. laser power, travel speed and angle of inclination were optimized according to bead geometry and braze alloy wetting at minimum heat input level, The properties of laser brazing were compared to that of furnace brazing. Microhardness profiles were used for <b>braze</b> <b>joint</b> property comparison between laser and furnace brazing. The cooling rate of laser brazing was compared to furnace brazing based on secondary dendritic arm spacing, Both optical and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were used to evaluate the microstructures of the braze materials and tube substrate. Metallography of the laser <b>braze</b> <b>joint</b> was compared to the furnace braze. SEM Energy Disperse X-Ray Spectra (EDX) and back scattered imaging were used to analyze braze alloy segregation. Although all of the laser systems, CO 2, ND:YAG, and direct diode laser produced good <b>braze</b> <b>joint,</b> the direct diode laser was selected for its system simplicity, compactness and portability. Excellent laser and braze alloy coupling is observed with powder alloy compared to braze alloy wire. Good wetting is found with different gold based braze alloys. The laser brazing process can be optimized so that the adverse affect on the parent materials can be eliminated. Metallography of the laser <b>braze</b> <b>joint</b> has shown that quality <b>braze</b> <b>joint</b> was produced with laser brazing process. Penetration of the laser braze to the substrate is at neglectable level. Zero penetration is observed. Microstructure examinations shown that no observable changes of the microstructure (grain structure and precipitation) in the HAZ area between laser braze and furnace braze. Wide gaps can be laser brazed with single pass for up to 0. 024 inches. Finer dendritic structure is observed in laser brazing compared with equiaxial and coarser grain of the furnace brazing microstructure. Greater segregation is also found in the furnace braze. Higher hardness of the laser <b>braze</b> <b>joint</b> comparing to furnace braze is observed due to the fast cooling rate and Finer microstructure in the laser <b>brazing.</b> Laser <b>braze</b> <b>joint</b> properties meet or exceed the furnace joint properties. Direct diode laser for thin section tube brazing with high temperature braze alloys have been successfully demonstrated. The laser's high energy density and precise control has shown significant advantages in reducing process heat input to the substrates and provide high quality <b>braze</b> <b>joints</b> comparing to other localized braze process such as torch, TIG, and MPTA processes. Significant cost savings can be realized particularly with localized braze comparing to a full furnace braze cycle...|$|R

50|$|High-quality <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> {{require that}} parts be closely fitted, and the base metals {{exceptionally}} clean {{and free of}} oxides. In most cases, joint clearances of 0.03 to 0.08 mm are recommended for the best capillary action and joint strength. However, in some brazing operations {{it is not uncommon}} to have joint clearances around 0.6 mm. Cleanliness of the brazing surfaces is also important, as any contamination can cause poor wetting (flow). The two main methods for cleaning parts, prior to brazing, are chemical cleaning and abrasive or mechanical cleaning. In the case of mechanical cleaning, it is important to maintain the proper surface roughness as wetting on a rough surface occurs much more readily than on a smooth surface of the same geometry.|$|E
50|$|Manual {{torch brazing}} is a {{procedure}} where {{the heat is}} applied using a gas flame placed {{on or near the}} joint being brazed. The torch can either be hand held or held in a fixed position depending on whether the operation is completely manual or has some level of automation. Manual brazing is most commonly used on small production volumes or in applications where the part size or configuration makes other brazing methods impossible. The main drawback is the high labor cost associated with the method as well as the operator skill required to obtain quality <b>brazed</b> <b>joints.</b> The use of flux or self-fluxing material is required to prevent oxidation. Torch brazing of copper can be done without the use of flux if it is brazed with a torch using oxygen and hydrogen gas, rather than oxygen and other flammable gases.|$|E

In the present work, mechanical reliability of low carbon steel <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> with copper filler metal is investigated and a methodology for failure analysis of <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> using the cohesive zone model (CZM) is presented. Mechanical reliability of the <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> is characterized by strength and toughness. Uniaxial and biaxial strengths of the joints are evaluated experimentally and estimated by finite element method using the ABAQUS software. Microstructural analysis of the joint fracture surfaces reveals different failure mechanisms of dimple rupture and dendritic failure. Resistance of the <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> against crack propagation, evaluated by the single-parameter fracture toughness criterion, shows dependency on the specimen geometry and loading configuration. Fracture of the <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> and the subsequent ductile tearing process are investigated using a two-parameter CZM.

40|$|AbstractBrazing, {{as one of}} {{the major}} {{connection}} technology, has been widely used in different areas such as aviation, aerospace, electronics and chemical industries etc. Sometimes creep fracture {{can be found in the}} <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> when they are used at high temperature. The conventional characterized method for creep properties cannot be used to study the <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> due to their small size. The impression technology has the potential to be used to study the creep properties of <b>brazed</b> <b>joints,</b> since no special requirements are needed for the size and shape of to-be-measured materials. In this investigation, Sn- 3. 5 Ag- 0. 7 Cu/Cu brazed joint is created and its creep properties is measured by impression creep testing. The effect of punching stress and temperature is studied on the impressing depth, which change from 70 to 100 MPa and 80 - 130 oC, respectively. The microstructure of Sn- 3. 5 Ag- 0. 7 Cu/Cu is examined by Optical Microscope (OM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectra (EDS). The results show that the impressing creep depth increases with the rise of temperature and punching stress. Creep resistance of the diffusion region has obvious effect on the creep resistance of the weld. The experimental results can provide the basis for the structural integrity analysis of <b>brazed</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{design for}} regeneratively cooled engine structures was identified. This design uses photochemically machined (PCM) coolant passages. It permits the <b>braze</b> <b>joint</b> {{to be placed}} in a relatively cool area, remote from the critical hot face sheet. The geometry of the passages at the face sheet also minimizes stress concentration and, therefore, enhances the low cycle fatigue performance. The two most promising alloys identified for this application are Inconel 617 and Nickel 201. Inconel 617 was selected because it has excellent creep rupture properties, while Nickel 201 was selected because of its predicted good performance under low cycle fatigue loading. The fabrication of the PCM coolant passages in both Inconel 617 and Nickel 201 was successfully developed. During fabrication of Inconel 617, undesirable characteristics were observed in the <b>braze</b> <b>joints.</b> A development program to resolve this condition was undertaken and led to definition of an isothermal solidification process for joining Inconel 617 panels. This process produced joints which approach parent metal strength and homogeneity...|$|R
40|$|Using {{composite}} filler {{is a very}} potential way {{to braze}} dissimilar material, especially braze metals with ceramics. The composite filler which is added varieties of high temperature alloy, carbon fiber and ceramic particles has a suitable coefficient of thermal expansion. The application of composite filler can release the residual stress caused by mismatch of thermal expansion coefficient in the <b>brazing</b> <b>joints</b> and improve the overall performance significantly. According to the traditional classification method of composite materials, the composite filler is divided into micron-reinforced composite filler and nano-reinforced composite filler, of which the feature and research status are discussed in this text. According {{to the influence of}} different size reinforced phases on microstructure and mechanical property of the <b>brazing</b> <b>joints,</b> nano-reinforced composite filler has more uniform and better structure compared with micron-reinforced composite filler, and higher joint strengh can be obtained by using it. However, the reinforced mechanism is still an open question, and will become the key area of the future research work...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{discusses}} direct resistance projection welding of a multi-core copper cable to a discharge brass terminal. Resistance welding {{was carried out}} with a conventional machine. The upper tungsten electrode, which comes {{into contact with the}} multi-core copper cable, and the lower copper electrode, on which the brass terminal is lying during welding, are described. In the experimental research, the optimum welding parameters for direct welding (i. e. welding without an intermediate layer or a brazing filler material) of the two workpieces concerned were found. The welded joints obtained were subjected to a strength test, and metallurgical and resistance investigations. The strength test showed that the welded joint was quality welded and had higher strength than the <b>brazed</b> <b>joint.</b> With a heat resistance test during current conduction, {{it was found that the}} joint heated much less than the <b>brazed</b> <b>joint.</b> Metallographic investigations of macro-specimens and a chemical analysis at the copperžbrass joining line are described...|$|R
