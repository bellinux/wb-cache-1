5|$|Mark Livolsi realized, as McKenna had on {{the other}} end, that the film worked <b>best</b> <b>when</b> it focused on the Andrea-Miranda storyline. Accordingly, he cut a number of {{primarily}} transitional scenes, such as Andrea's job interview and the Runway staff's trip to Holt's studio. He also took out a scene early on where Miranda complimented Andrea. Upon reviewing them for the DVD, Frankel admitted he hadn't even seen them before, since Livolsi didn't include them in any prints he sent to the director.|$|E
5|$|Pigeonhole sort, {{counting}} sort, radix sort, and Van Emde Boas tree sorting {{all work}} <b>best</b> <b>when</b> the key size is small; for large enough keys, they become slower than comparison sorting algorithms. However, when the key size or the word size is very large {{relative to the}} number of items (or equivalently when the number of items is small), it may again become possible to sort quickly, using different algorithms that take advantage of the parallelism inherent in the ability to perform arithmetic operations on large words.|$|E

5|$|The left-handed Darling was {{a strong}} driver of the ball who showed the batsman the full face of the bat. When necessary, he was a dour defender of his wicket. His fellow players thought that was {{sometimes}} unnecessarily defensive in his approach to batting {{and that he was}} at his <b>best</b> <b>when</b> driving hard. His South Australian and Australian team mate George Giffen thought that no Australian's cut shots travelled faster past point.|$|E

5|$|It also tolerates {{a variety}} of soil conditions. Although young {{specimens}} perform <b>best</b> <b>when</b> planted {{in a mixture of}} peat and either sand or perlite, P.atriplicifolia can thrive in sandy, chalky, or loamy soil, or heavy clay soil with sufficient drainage. It can endure a wide range of soil pH, as well as exposure to salty conditions near oceans. Its deep-feeding taproot makes it especially drought tolerant; for this reason it has seen wide use for xeriscaping in the Intermountain West. Overwatering and over-fertilization can damage its roots and lead to a rapid decline in health. P.atriplicifolia is otherwise generally free from plant pathogens. In cultivation, it is also rarely selected as forage by grazing animals, and so is considered both a deer-resistant and rabbit-resistant plant.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Moorefield was a cavalry {{battle in}} the American Civil War, which took place on August 7, 1864. The {{fighting}} occurred along the South Branch of the Potomac River, north of Moorefield, West Virginia, in Hardy County. The National Park Service groups this battle with Early's Washington Raid and operations against the B Railroad, {{and it was the}} last major {{battle in the}} region before General Philip Sheridan took command of Union troops in the Shenandoah Valley. This Union triumph was the third of three major victories (Battle of Droop Mountain, Battle of Rutherford's Farm, and the Battle of Moorefield) for Brigadier General William W. Averell, who performed <b>best</b> <b>when</b> operating on his own.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{had a good}} {{technique}} for batting. He possessed a fluent, attractive style, and his height allowed him to reach the ball and drive more comfortably than most. His best shots were on the leg side, using his strong wrists to turn the ball away when it was aimed towards his legs. Yardley performed <b>best</b> <b>when</b> his side was in difficulty, and he could play attacking or defensive innings depending on the situation. He bowled intelligently, leading to greater rewards than his gentle style led opponents to expect, but remained a reluctant bowler who was surprised by his own success. He was a good fielder in positions close to the batsmen.|$|E

5|$|After missing {{most of the}} 193435 {{domestic}} season due to injury, McCabe scored an unbeaten 189 in the Second Test of the 193536 tour of South Africa, {{including a}} century in one session, taking Australia {{to the brink of}} a world record-breaking victory on a difficult final-day pitch in poor light before the match was called off. It was one of two Test centuries McCabe made on the tour. The following season, he made five fifties in the first four Tests before scoring a century to help Australia win the deciding final Test against the touring Englishmen. In the First Test of the 1938 tour of England, McCabe played what was regarded as his greatest innings, scoring 232 in four hours, including his last 72 in 28 minutes. Bradman regarded the innings as the greatest batting he ever saw. However, none of McCabe’s three most famous innings resulted in an Australian victory; he has a reputation of being at his <b>best</b> <b>when</b> Australia was in difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose's height, and the {{accuracy}} {{with which he}} bowled, {{made it difficult for}} batsmen to play forward to the ball; instead they were forced to play with their weight going back. His accuracy meant that he was effective if the pitch favoured batsmen. He bowled an effective yorker, and unlike other fast bowlers, used short-pitched deliveries sparingly, although he could bowl a hostile bouncer, and concentrated on bowling a full length aimed at the wickets. Ambrose rarely engaged in verbal sparring with batsmen, although in later years he occasionally inspected the pitch in an area close to the batsman before an innings began and rubbed his hands to suggest that he would enjoy bowling there. He always aimed to concede as few runs as possible when bowling, and frequently berated himself when he offered an easy delivery from which to score. Following his dismissal of a batsman, Ambrose often celebrated by pumping the air with his fists. With Courtney Walsh, Ambrose developed a reputation for performing at his <b>best</b> <b>when</b> his team seemed likely to lose, and he often took wickets in clusters which devastated the opposition. In addition, he was often most effective against the leading batsmen on a team; he was also capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in the techniques of other batsmen.|$|E
5|$|The Ashes {{series was}} the only one of seven series that Australia failed to win since Davidson became the team's {{frontline}} strike bowler in 1957–58. Of the 33 Tests in this period, Australia won 16, lost four, drew 12 and tied one. Davidson missed one of the drawn games through injury and broke down mid-match in another two. In the five years that he and Benaud led Australia's bowling attack, the pair totalled 333 wickets; Davidson 170 at 19.25 and Benaud 163 at 25, and were a major part in Australia's return to the forefront of world cricket. This came after the first four years of Davidson's career saw Australia win none and lose seven matches out of twelve. Often bowling in tandem, Davidson's accuracy also forced opposition batsmen to attack Benaud, leading them to perish from the pressure to raise the run rate. In the four years after Davidson retired, Australia struggled without his wicket-taking ability. Only one of the six series was won and two were lost; in all Australia managed six wins and eight losses in 30 Tests. Davidson was at his <b>best</b> <b>when</b> Australia was on her knees; In the four Test losses during the last five years of his career, he took 32 wickets at an average of just 13.9 including a ten wicket haul. In the Tied Test, he took eleven wickets, the other ten wicket haul in his Test career.|$|E

5|$|The surface {{friction}} tester {{is a small}} {{fifth wheel}} attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure road slipperiness. The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the friction between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the torque produced by {{the rotation of the}} wheel. Surface friction testers are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works <b>best</b> <b>when</b> attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Cain started {{competing}} in 2007, {{and made the}} Australian national team the same year. During Australia's 2009 domestic series, the Australia Cup, an invitation-only series for the top shooters in the country, he earned a bronze, silver and gold medal. That year, he made his national team debut at an international event when he represented Australia at the 2009 ISSF World Cup in South Korea. By early 2010, {{he was looking for}} a sponsor to assist with costs for his international competitions. He set a personal best of 598 out of 600 in the SH-2 prone air event at the 2010 World Cup in Germany, and not long after, set a new personal <b>best</b> <b>when</b> he shot 599 at the same event at the 2010 World Cup in France. He came in first at the 2010 Oceania Shooting Federation Continental Championship. At the 2010 IPC World Shooting Championships in Zagreb, he came in first in the SH-2 prone air event by setting a world record of 600 points, a perfect score. At the 2011 Great Britain International, he finished second in the 10m air rifle prone event. He competed in the United States-hosted International Paralympic Committee World Cup in 2011, finishing fourth in the R5 Air Rifle Prone event with a score of 599. He earned a gold medal in the team event with teammates Jason Maroney and Bradley Mark. In 2012, he trained up to six days a week. At the Australian nationals, he finished second in the prone event behind New Zealander Michael Johnson, and third in the standing event behind fellow Australian Bradley Marks and Johnson.|$|E
