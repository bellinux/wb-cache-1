Rather than single pieces, {{which would require}} the audience to applaud every few minutes, Morricone thought the <b>best</b> <b>idea</b> {{was to create a}} series of suites lasting from 15 to 20 minutes, which form a sort of symphony in various movements – alternating successful pieces with personal favorites. In concert, Morricone normally has 180 to 200 musicians and vocalists under his baton, performing multiple genre-crossing collections of music. Rock, symphonic and ethnic instruments share the stage.|$|E

25|$|Screen shot: Screen {{shots are}} blind shots, {{in which the}} goalie can not find the {{location}} of the puck. Goalies should never anticipate or guess when and where the puck will hit. In the screen shot, another player (usually an opponent, but sometimes the goaltender's own teammate) stands between the shooter and the goaltender, obscuring the goaltender's vision of the shot. On a screen shot, the goaltender must do everything possible to try to see the shot, dropping to the butterfly stance and thrusting their glove out at the sound of a shot is not the <b>best</b> <b>idea</b> in the modern game. Some goalies, such as Ed Belfour or Ron Hextall, went as far as (illegally) punching players in the head or slashing their legs.|$|E

The writers listened to both network executive and fans in order to formulate the <b>best</b> <b>idea</b> as to how to handle the situation. Peterson noted that people wanted [...] "one big transformation".
