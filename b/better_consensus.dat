50|$|Based on {{computer}} models, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) began {{to assess the}} possibility of a widespread severe weather event for November 17 as early as November 12, though too much uncertainty existed at the time to delineate the probability and scale of the event. As models gained a <b>better</b> <b>consensus,</b> the SPC later anticipated substantial increase in atmospheric instability along the periphery of a potential cold front, indicating the risk of damaging wind gusts and tornadoes. Additional confidence over the next 24 hours resulted in a substantial expanding of this risk area into the lower Great Lakes on November 14, valid for Day 4. The overlap of increasing moisture in the atmosphere, wind shear, and high levels of CAPE were expected to contribute to the potential severe weather. The development supercells and later squall lines was anticipated, and was also expected to impact the Mid-Atlantic states. At around midday on November 15, the SPC issued a slight risk for severe weather for the 16th in regions concentrated primarily around Iowa and Missouri, forecasting the possibility of storms particularly during the evening to overnight hours of November 16. The system associated with those storms was to track eastward and strengthen, and as a result the SPC also issued a Day 3 slight risk earlier on November 15 for a large swath of the Eastern United States in effect for November 17. The slight risk included a 30% chance of severe thunderstorm activity was forecast for an area concentrated on Indiana and Ohio.|$|E

Numerous antimicrobial agents with distinct spectrums of action, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics {{have been used in}} its treatment. Surgical techniques, including muscle grafts, the Ilizarov technique, and antibiotic bone cements, have been applied. However, bone infections are still a challenge. Despite the importance of isolation and identification of microorganisms to determine the antimicrobial treatment of bone infections, there are few systematic national studies about the etiological profile of these diseases. This article describes the current knowledge of osteomyelitis and summarizes published national data based on the experience of different Orthopedic and Traumatology Services. In general, S. aureus was described as an important etiological agent; however, the difference in design of national studies makes a comparison between the prevalence of bone infection, the associated risk factors, and the different therapeutic approaches difficult.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{approach to}} predicting the geographical extent of species invasions consists of training {{models in the}} native range and projecting them in distinct, potentially invasible areas.

We propose an alternative approach that involves fitting models with pooled data from all ranges. We show that this pooled approach improves prediction of the extent of invasion of spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) in North America on models based solely on the European native range. Furthermore, it performs equally well on models based on the invaded range, while ensuring the inclusion of areas with similar climate to the European niche, where the species is likely to spread further.

Projections from the pooled models show fewer areas of intermediate climatic suitability than projections from the native or invaded range models, suggesting a <b>better</b> <b>consensus</b> among modelling techniques and reduced uncertainty...|$|E

The experimental annotation of the disorder lags behind the rapidly accumulating number of known protein chains, which motivates the development of computational predictors of disorder. Some of these methods address predictions of certain types/flavors of the disorder and recent years show that consensusbased predictors provide a viable way to improve predictive performance. However, {{the selection of the}} base predictors in a given consensus is usually performed in an ad-hock manner, based on their availability and with a premise that more is better. We perform first-of-its-kind investigation that analyzes complementarity among a dozen recent predictors to identify characteristics of (future) predictors that would lead to further consensus-based improvements in the predictive quality. The complementarity of a given set of three base predictors is expressed by the differences in their predictions when compared {{with each other and with}} their majority vote consensus. We propose a regression-based model that quantifies/predicts quality of the majority-vote consensus of a given triplet of predictors based on their individual predictive performance and their complementarity measured at the residue and the disorder segment levels. Our model shows that improved performance is associated with higher (lower) similarity between the three base predictors at the residue (segment) level and to their consensus prediction at the segment (residue) level. We also show that <b>better</b> <b>consensuses</b> utilize higher quality base methods. We use our model to predict the best-performing consensus on an independent test dataset and our empirical evaluation shows that this consensus outperforms individual methods and other consensus-based predictors based on the area under the ROC curve measure.

Assuming that all agents follow the same union-consistency decision rule as in Cave [1983], we give a sufficient condition on the aggregate statistic of decisions such that the common knowledge of this statistic implies the equality of all decisions. We also prove that if information partitions are finite, an iterative process of public announcement of the statistic, where agents update their decision on the basis of their private information plus the announced value of the statistic, achieves the situation of common knowledge, and hence converges to an equilibrium characterized by equality of decisions. We then show that all admissible statistics are equivalent in informational terms, which is there's no admissible statistic that leads to a <b>better</b> <b>consensus</b> than an other.

Methods: The variability of medical findings focused on the prostate gland (central gland, peripheral and tumoural zones) by two independent experts was firstly evaluated, and secondly compared with a consensus of these two experts. Using a prostate MRI database, experts drew regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to healthy prostate (peripheral and central zones) and cancer using a semi-automated tool. One of the experts then drew the ROI with knowledge of the other expert's ROI.

40|$|Abstract—The {{wisdom of}} crowds {{refers to the}} {{phenomenon}} in which the collective knowledge of a community {{is greater than the}} knowledge of any individual. This paper proposes a network design for the fastest and slowest consensus formation under average node degree restrictions, which is one aspect of the wisdom of crowds concept. Consensus and synchronization problems are closely related to variety of issues such as collective behavior in nature, the interaction among agents as a matter of the robot control, and building efficient wireless sensor networks. However, designing networks with desirable properties is complex and it may pose a multi-constraint and multi-criterion optimization problem. For the purpose of realizing such efficient network topology, this paper presents an optimization approach to design networks for <b>better</b> <b>consensus</b> formation by focusing on the eigenvalue spectral of Laplacian matrix. In both the fastest and slowest networks presented, consensus is formed among local structures first, then on a global scale. This suggests that both local and global topology influence the networks dynamics. These findings are useful for those who seek to manage efficient consensus and synchronization in a setting that can be modeled as a multi-agent system.

40|$|Although many {{successful}} ensemble clustering {{approaches have}} been developed in recent years, there are still two limitations {{to most of the}} existing approaches. First, they mostly overlook the issue of uncertain links, which may mislead the overall consensus process. Second, they generally lack the ability to incorporate global information to refine the local links. To address these two limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel ensemble clustering approach based on sparse graph representation and probability trajectory analysis. In particular, we present the elite neighbor selection strategy to identify the uncertain links by locally adaptive thresholds and build a sparse graph with a small number of probably reliable links. We argue that a small number of probably reliable links can lead to significantly <b>better</b> <b>consensus</b> results than using all graph links regardless of their reliability. The random walk process driven by a new transition probability matrix is utilized to explore the global information in the graph. We derive a novel and dense similarity measure from the sparse graph by analyzing the probability trajectories of the random walkers, based on which two consensus functions are further proposed. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

40|$|Prediction of {{functionally}} important residues in globular proteins from unusual central {{distances of}} amino acids Marek Kochańczyk 1, 2 Background: Well-performing automated protein function recognition approaches usually comprise several complementary techniques. Beside constructing <b>better</b> <b>consensus,</b> their predictive {{power can be}} improved by either adding or refining independent modules that explore orthogonal features of proteins. In this work, we demonstrated how the exploration of global atomic distributions {{can be used to}} indicate functionally important residues. Results: Using a set of carefully selected globular proteins, we parametrized continuous probability density functions describing preferred central distances of individual protein atoms. Relative preferred burials were estimated using mixture models of radial density functions dependent on the amino acid composition of a protein under consideration. The unexpectedness of extraordinary locations of atoms was evaluated in the informationtheoretic manner and used directly for the identification of key amino acids. In the validation study, we tested capabilities of a tool built upon our approach, called SurpResi, by searching for binding sites interacting with ligands. The tool indicated multiple candidate sites achieving success rates comparable to several geometric methods. We also showed that the unexpectedness is a property of regions involved in protein-protein interactions, and thus can be used for the ranking of protein docking predictions.
