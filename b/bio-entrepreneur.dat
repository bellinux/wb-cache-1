An author of about 70 scientific research papers, author, editor, and contributor to many books, and 15 patent applications, Bill was most notable {{for his work}} translating science from the lab in to industry. [...] His recent academic research centred on engineering of antibodies for application in health care, management of environmental pollution, and the derivation and use of novel combinatorial libraries. In early 2015, Bill was celebrated as a pioneering <b>bio-entrepreneur</b> by the University of Aberdeen during a two-day symposium at the Institute of Medical sciences.|$|E
40|$|In {{the modern}} {{healthcare}} and medical sectors corporate bio-pharmaceutical firms continue {{to scale down}} their in-house research and development (R&D) activities in favour of outsourcing the services to bio-tech ventures. These small but, entrepreneurial research-oriented organisations have increased dramatically. They are predominantly owned by <b>bio-entrepreneurs</b> who are extensively experienced scientists. In the science-based industry they operate in, innovation “ecosystems” consisting of global business and social networks are a common feature. As such, they have to consistently exploit them to complement the knowledge gaps in their enterprises. In that context, the paper sets out to investigate five <b>bio-entrepreneurs</b> currently active in biotechnology within the East Midlands region in England. It particularly examines the role performed by their prior-learning and their cumulative science experiences in recognising, assimilating and productively applying science-related knowledge acquired in their innovation “ecosystems”...|$|R

40|$|Biotechnology {{refers to}} the large and growing array of {{scientific}} tools that use living cells and their molecules to make biological products for many different industries. Human and animal health care, agriculture, forestry, environment, and specialty chemicals are among the industries that have benefited most from biotechnology. The economic promise of biotechnology is extraordinary. At present a $ 60 billion sector worldwide, it is estimated to become a market of at least $ 120 billion annually within 10 years. Although this is a high-growth sector, moving a promising research discovery to market is a complex, costly and challenging undertaking. In this paper we have identified and addressed challenges that are unique to a biotechnology startup. The approach used to compile the information included a combination of interviews with Chicago-based <b>bio-entrepreneurs</b> and research using industry journals, business databases and newspaper articles. The challenges of starting a biotechnology company in the US include raising capital, building strategic partnerships, recruiting, motivating and retaining top scientific talent and compliance with regulatory bodies. Running a biotechnology company entail...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This study {{investigates the}} efforts of {{stakeholders}} in a regional innovation system (RIS) to reconstruct the system to enable {{the development of the}} nascent biotechnology industry in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Various institutions and organisations {{played a crucial role in}} effecting these changes. One of the most important changes involved legislation that altered the role that universities play in bridging the gap between research outputs and reaping commercial benefits from such outputs. Following the logic of the regional innovation system, the study focused on the institutional changes, the mechanisms employed to bridge this gap (from creating spin-off firms, and licensing technologies based on university research, to designing programmes to support the development of <b>bio-entrepreneurs).</b> For a comparative perspective from another region that arrived on the biotechnology scene relatively late, the study includes a section on university spin-offs in biotechnology from Hong Kong universities. Since all the efforts to effect the changes to the RIS that would enhance the growth of this promising industry are relatively new, the study faced the usual problems associated with pioneering developments, such as small samples, a complete lack of databases, etc. For this reason, the questionnaire survey and case study methods were used throughout the study. Starting from the general to the specific, the thesis is divided into four complementary parts. Part I comprises the general literature survey and rationale for the study, while Part II narrows the focus to the organisations and mechanisms that connect knowledge creation and knowledge exploitation in the regional context in the Western Cape, South Africa and Hong Kong, China. Part III evaluates early efforts at building a bridge from science to business in the form of bio-entrepreneurship programmes. Part IV takes a micro view, tracking the evolution of biotechnology spin-offs from Western Cape universities, and highlighting the role that institutional changes played in the genesis, growth and, unfortunately, demise of some biotechnology spin-offs. The last section concludes. Throughout the study a familiar refrain repeated itself with respect to the challenges faced by new spin-offs, namely the perennial culprits of a lack of appropriate skills, and funding. From our study, bearing in mind the small scale and the danger of generalisations, it would seem as if the reconstruction of the RIS and related changes in the national innovation system (NIS 1) did not generate the results that the strategy hoped for (at least in the Western Cape, the focus of our study). A beam of light is the relative success achieved with the development and implementation of a bio-entrepreneurship training programme, which laid the foundation to build a more sustainable bridge between the science of biotechnology and the commercial world where the wealth creation opportunities reside...|$|R
