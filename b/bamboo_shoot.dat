Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), melon, apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry.

The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the great}} {{diversity}} within this genus, as of 2017, comprehensive life-history studies of Amphidromus species are still lacking; {{only a few}} observations of behavior of species within the genus exist, and these observations are scattered throughout the literature. A study by Eugen Paravicini (1921) described egg-laying behaviour in Amphidromus palaceus var. pura at Palimanan, West Java. According to Paravicini's observations, in October, 1920, locals from West Java brought in two [...] "nests" [...] containing snails that had just begun depositing their eggs; one snail had folded the exterior leaves of a young <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoot</b> and gummed them together into a pointed cornet. The shoot hung vertically with the narrow end pointed upward, and the wide opening below. The {{upper part of the}} sack was filled with eggs when collected. The snail descended slowly, rotating around its longitudinal axis, and deposited eggs until the entire cavity was filled up. If a crack in the basket exposed eggs to the air, they quickly dried up. Two days after capture, egg-laying was finished, and the snail closed the opening by folding over more leaves. Probably four days were spent in egg-laying, since the cavity was half filled at the start of observations. A second nest of similarly folded mango leaves contained 234 eggs. The volume of eggs in each case greatly exceeded the size of the snail, indicating that the eggs must be encapsulated just before deposition. The capsules were very thin, and dried quickly upon any exposure to the air. October marked the start of the rainy season and probably this is the normal breeding period. Eggs of A. porcellanus were reported by van Benthem Jutting (1950, p.493) to have started hatching only ten days after being laid. Similar nest-building habits have been reported for other species, but no complete study of a life cycle has been published. Up until 1961, no information was available on the cycle of activity, longevity, rate of growth, etc.|$|E

40|$|What are <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoots?</b> <b>Bamboo</b> <b>shoots</b> {{are young}} <b>bamboo</b> stems (culms). They are very nutritious {{and have been}} eaten as a {{vegetable}} {{for thousands of years}} in many Asian countries. There are three types of shoots; spring or summer shoots, winter shoots (very tender) and rhizome shoots. How are they produced? Most bamboos produce new culms once each year, usually in the spring or autumn. By careful management of bamboo plantations a maximum number of shoots can be encouraged to grow each year. They can then be harvested when they are about 15 - 30 cm long, depending on the species. What is the market for <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoots?</b> The market for <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoots</b> is very large. Fresh shoots are very popular in many regions, but it is the export market for canned shoots that holds more potential for growth. Increasing populations of Asian peoples in all countries of the world, and popularity of shoots amongst non traditional consumers, means that the market for shoots is presently growing at a rapid pace and can be expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. What is the role of a <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoots</b> plantation in rural development? A <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoots</b> plantation can bring degraded lands back into production and provide income-generating options for farmers. It is easily adopted because it builds on the inherent plant cultivation skills of the farmers. Bamboos grow better with organic inputs, such as fertiliser, so the production of shoots is not harmful to the environment. Additionally, if established in conjunction with a local shoot-canning unit, benefits to the employees and the wider community will result. How do I establish a <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoots</b> plantation? All that is required to establish a <b>bamboo</b> <b>shoots</b> plantation is land and bamboo propagules. The costs of establishment are thus limited to the cost of the propagules and the labour. Ideally some linkages to shoots processors would be established to guarantee a market for the shoots. Alternatively the plantation may be established in conjunction with a shoot-processing unit. Both could be established as part of one community cooperative and producers and processors would benefit. <b>Bamboo</b> <b>shoots</b> are very nutritious and have been eaten as a vegetable for thousands of years in many Asian countrie...|$|R
