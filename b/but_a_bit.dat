5|$|The {{episode is}} a tribute to the silent films that were played in theaters with musical accompaniment, and 27 minutes of it are entirely dialogue-free. Several types of music are used to express what is not being said; music acts as the narrator. During Giles' {{overhead}} presentation he plays a recorded version of Camille Saint-Saëns' Danse Macabre. Buffy and Riley's love theme is presented for the first time when they kiss in this episode. This composition by Christophe Beck—who composed scores for Buffy regularly—pleased Joss Whedon more than the Buffy and Angel love theme. He considered the Buffy-Riley theme more adult, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more strange and blue than the Buffy-Angel theme: a prediction of where the relationship between Buffy and Riley would go.|$|E
25|$|Goblin Island {{became the}} first in the {{so-called}} Scottish Sequence of six titles, four of which are set largely in Scotland: Goblin Island itself, set on 'Loch Avie', a fictionalised Loch Lomond; Princess in Tatters, set on 'Loch Ruel', which may be Loch Fyne; A Holiday Queen, set at 'Morven' on what appears to be Loch Long; and Schoolgirls and Scouts set at 'Glenleny', which also seems to be on Loch Long, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> further up the loch. Of the other two in the series, Twins of Castle Charming - perhaps Oxenham's rarest title - is set largely in Switzerland, whereas Finding Her Family has some early scenes set in Ealing and mainly takes place in Saltburn.|$|E

500|$|Euryoryzomys emmonsae is {{a fairly}} large, long-tailed rice rat with long, soft fur. The hairs on the back are [...] long. It {{generally}} resembles E.nitidus in these and other characters, but has a longer tail. E.macconnelli is slightly larger and has longer and duller fur. In E.emmonsae, the upperparts are tawny brown, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> darker on the head because many hairs have black tips. The hairs of the underparts are gray at the bases and white at the tips; overall, the fur appears mostly white. In most specimens, there is a patch on the chest where the gray bases are absent. The longest of the vibrissae (whiskers) of the face extend slightly beyond the ears. The eyelids are black. The ears are covered with small, yellowish brown hairs and appear dark brown overall. The feet are covered with white hairs above and brown below. There are six pads on the plantar surface, but the hypothenar is reduced. The ungual tufts, tufts of hair which surround the bases of the claws, are well-developed. The tail is like the body in color above, and mostly white below, but in the [...] nearest the tail tip it is brown below.|$|E

500|$|The miniseries Stakes, which aired {{during the}} show’s seventh season, {{documents}} the reemergence {{of five of}} Marceline’s most powerful vampiric foes: the Fool (voiced by Ron Funches), the Empress Eyes (voiced by Rebecca Romijn), the Hierophant (voiced by Paul Williams), the Moon (voiced by Beau Billingslea), and the Vampire King himself (voiced by Billy Brown). The quintet remerge after Bubblegum tries to extract Marceline’s vampiric essence, {{in an attempt to}} return Marceline to her normal half-demon state. The reappearance of these vampires forces Marceline, Bubblegum, Finn, Jake, and Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) to stake them one-by-one, although the Vampire King is neutralized through a scientific process that removes the vampiric essence from his body. Later, in the ninth season miniseries Elements, Marceline is temporarily transformed by elemental magic into [...] "Marhsmaline the Campfire Queen"a sentient marshmallow creature. In her candy form, Marceline is gregarious and playful, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> naive {{about the nature of the}} new world around her; for instance, when an enraged Flame Princess attacks her, Marceline mistakes the assault for [...] "wrasslin'". At the end of the miniseries, Marceline is returned to her usual self.|$|E
500|$|In {{comparison}} to the previous track on Lotus, [...] "Red Hot Kinda Love", Chris Younie for 4Music wrote that [...] "Make the World Move" [...] is [...] "not the same", but [...] "by no means hugely different." [...] Younie continued {{to say that the}} song is [...] "a bit retro and a bit modern" [...] and [...] "a bit underground <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> mainstream." [...] While he praised the chorus and its memorability, Younie labelled the track as being [...] "lacklustre following 'Red Hot Kinda Love. Sarah Godfrey of The Washington Post described the song as a [...] "strange" [...] dance version of Buffalo Springfield's [...] "For What It's Worth". Robert Copsey wrote that the song did not fulfill his expectations. Michael Gallucci for Popcrush noted that as the fourth song on the album, it [...] "keeps the party going", but is forgettable. The Huffington Posts Mesfin Fekadu criticized [...] "Make the World Move", along with album tracks [...] "Around the World" [...] and [...] "Red Hot Kinda Love", for failing to capture the [...] "fun" [...] in which they are supposed to embody.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Man in the Blue Flannel Pants" [...] {{has been}} {{generally}} received as being average in quality by television critics. The A.V. Clubs Hayden Childs gave the episode an overall rating of B- {{and found that}} the episode [...] "wasn’t particularly funny but neither was it particularly bad." [...] She praised the episode for [...] "a strong storyline" [...] and [...] "elements that often crop up in the better episodes, like a focus that does not stray too far from the Simpson family and a B-plot that works". Despite this, she felt that the [...] "jokes are so low-key and mild that the episode zooms by without raising a single chuckle or smirk." [...] Similarly, Jason Hughes of AOL TV commented that [...] "hile it was a charming enough episode, there were no stand-out moments of clever satire or unexpected twists." [...] Ology's Josh Harrison was slightly more negative and thought the episode was [...] "charming <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a comic flop". He concluded that the episode was nothing special and gave the episode a rating of six out of ten.|$|E

Keller rated the matches {{on a scale}} out of 5 stars, with the main event given a 3 1/4 stars and called a [...] "fine match that fit its slot on the PPV well" [...] but had a finish that he described as [...] "horrible". He gave Jarrett versus Angle 3 1/2 stars with Keller commenting {{that it was a}} [...] "good old-school match ... <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> slow".

500|$|Reviewing {{the track}} for AOL Radio Blog, Voerding wrote [...] "Michele's voice {{is among the}} cast's most versatile, striding {{confidently}} through growls and whispers, proclamations and wavering cries. This single, with the drive of its melody and narrative, is no exception." [...] Kirsten Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called Michele's voice on the song [...] "phenomenal," [...] and commented [...] "I love how her vocals are reined in, and then build up to that wonderful glory note. I seriously got chills while listening to it." [...] She also commented how the song's narrative fit Michele's storyline on the show. Christopher Rosen of Movieline wrote [...] "If you love Lea Michele’s voice, you’ll like [...] "Get It Right." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator said [...] "This one, compared to the instantly catchy “Loser Like Me”, {{is a bit more}} underwhelming, though Lea kills it." [...] Jarret Wieselman of The New York Post said [...] "Lea Michele's voice was on point throughout this soaring ballad, but without that secret ingredient, lyrics like [...] "my best intentions keep making a mess of things" [...] are best left to Rachel's diary." [...] Although she called it [...] "boring" [...] and said it was like every other reflection-ballad performed by Michele, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone said that the song would fit in on Top 40 radio. Melinda Newman of HitFix said the song was [...] "lovely, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> dull." ...|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the film. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com praised the subtle and refreshing humour, noting that [...] "Gowariker shows a flair for light scenes and creating atmospheric nuances" [...] but criticising the loopy screenplay. Verma called it [...] "ultimately a performance-oriented film", stating: [...] "A terrific ensemble cast {{from the world of}} television and theatre collaborate to its feel-good believability which lasts as long as their screen time." [...] She particularly praised Chopra's performance and wrote: [...] "Priyanka Chopra transforms into 12 new skins with astonishing distinction, voice and spirit. The actress reinvents herself into this unique individual every single time ranging from batty, bashful and boisterous. This is simply her show." [...] Sonia Chopra of Sify also gave a mixed review, noting that the film could have been hugely entertaining but was affected by [...] "a repetitive layout and agonising length". She believed that the film was watchable because of Priyanka Chopra's [...] "consistently stellar act"; she carried the film ably on her shoulders and gave [...] "a fun and uninhibited performance." [...] Namrata Joshi of Outlook gave the film 2 stars out of 4. She thought that Chopra played her characters [...] "competently, confidently <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> unevenly" [...] and wrote: [...] "The one trump card for the film is the new queen bee Priyanka Chopra. The film is out-and-out a Priyanka show as she hogs screen time and audience attention with her 12 roles." ...|$|E

Some of his staff had reservations about him. Colonel Alan Vasey, his Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General, asserted that Mackay lacked the ruthlessness to remove Militia officers who were not performing well. Vasey fumed about [...] "that bloody schoolteacher who wants to dot every 'i' and cross every 't'". Many regular officers were embittered by years of slow promotion followed by Prime Minister Robert Menzies ordering that commands in the 6th Division be given to Militia officers. Colonel Frank Berryman considered this [...] "a damn insult to the professional soldier, calculated to split the Army down the centre. We were to be the hewers of wood and the drawers of water. We, the only people who really knew the job, were to assist these Militia fellows". Berryman, who worked closely with Mackay as his chief of staff, held him in high regard. [...] "For moral and physical courage", said Berryman, [...] "few equalled him—none ever surpassed him. He was an educated and most knowledgeable soldier... and extremely patient". His Commander, Royal Australian Artillery, a reservist, Brigadier Edmund Herring, considered Mackay [...] "a most competent and able commander in North Africa and Greece, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> old...

Elena Gorgan of Softpedia said [...] "even with all this, she hardly manages {{to create a}} strong impression [...]., the video fails to break any visual ground, albeit standing on its own as a stylish video." [...] The Daily Mail agreed saying [...] " [...] which {{will no doubt be}} interpreted by fans as an insight into Cheryl's marriage to footballer Ashley Cole.

The net result is, sorry to say it, very regal <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> on the dull side." [...] Lisa McGarry of 'Unreality TV' [...] said the platinum wig was [...] "strange" [...] She also said [...] "if it doesn’t look great, at least it looks shocking." [...] Meanwhile, David Balls of 'Digital Spy' said [...] " [...] this glitzy split-screen affair, Cheryl looks effortlessly classy and glam as she transforms into an Egyptian goddess and - with more success than a certain Mrs. B (Mel B) back in 2001 [...] - shows how to wear a blonde wig without looking like you're on a dirty weekend in the Toon. Perfectly complimenting the song itself, this super-glossy clip also suggests that Cole has a firm eye on global stardom over the next year."
