5|$|Concerns {{over the}} state of the {{environment}} around the most popular parts of the Mont Blanc massif, and the need for visitors to better respect it, were reflected in a statement in 2014 by Jean-Marc Peillex, the mayor of Saint-Gervais, who said:Mont Blanc is a heap of garbage... a mountain covered with the crap, urine and detritus of the last 50 years. The problems are covered up by a nice, white blanket of snow. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to confront people with the reality and to reach those people who abuse the mountain. Following the construction of the new Goûter Hut used by most climbers ascending Mont Blanc, the authorities now strictly enforce a 'no wild-camping' ban above the level of Tête Rousses Hut. Each high altitude hut faces its own individual challenges, often relating to water and energy supply or waste management, and the provision of services to visitors can sometimes conflict with environmental protection. A range of individual solutions for a selection of huts within the massif and elsewhere in the Alps was identified by a project run by Espace Mont Blanc between 2007 and 2013.|$|E

500|$|Virginia's {{condition}} {{might have}} been what prompted the Poe family to move, {{in the hopes of}} finding a healthier environment for her. They moved several times within Philadelphia in the early 1840s and their last home in that city is now preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site in Spring Garden. In this home, Virginia was well enough to tend the flower garden and entertain visitors by playing the harp or the piano and singing. The family then moved to New York sometime in early April 1844, traveling by train and steamboat. Virginia waited on board the ship while her husband secured space at a boarding house on Greenwich Street. By early 1846, family friend Elizabeth Oakes Smith said that Virginia admitted, [...] "I know I shall die soon; I know I can't get well; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to be as happy as possible, and make Edgar happy."

Kingpin is the murderer of Matt's father, and {{the man responsible for}} the hiring of Bullseye, with intention of having the Natchios family murdered. Michael Clarke Duncan signed on for the role in January 2002, though he had been attached far earlier. When Duncan was cast, he weighed 290 pounds. He was asked to gain 40 pounds for the role in order to fit the physique of Kingpin. In order to do this, he would lift weights for 30 minutes a day, and power-lifted with one or two reps a day, as well as eating whatever he wanted. Despite this, Duncan's biggest concern was that he is black, while Kingpin has always been portrayed as white. Also, Duncan provided the voice for Kingpin in [...] He spoke on the fan's loyalty to the source material by saying [...] "they watch movies to say, 'Hey, that's not like the comic book.' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> them to get past that and just see the movie for what it is and see me for what I am—an actor." ...|$|E

It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E
500|$|D'Angelo was {{dissatisfied}} with the direction of R and soul music when conceiving the album. In an interview for Jet, he said that [...] "the term R doesn't mean {{what it used to}} mean.

It's sad—they've turned black music into a club thing." [...] In the liner notes for Voodoo, Saul Williams examined the album's concept and echoes D'Angelo's dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R/soul and hip hop, noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres. In an interview for Ebony, D'Angelo said of his role and influences for Voodoo, [...] "I consider myself very respectful of the masters who came before. In some ways, I feel a responsibility to continue and take the cue from what they were doing musically and vibe on it. That's what I want to do. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to do it for this time and this generation". In the album's EPK, D'Angelo said that Voodoo is [...] "like a funk album.

Both Jam and Lewis were asked by Usher's mother, and then manager, to contribute to 8701s production, during the 2000 MTV Music Awards. According to Jam, his mother had said [...] "Oh my God, Usher's got this track and we thought you guys would be perfect to produce it". Several months later, Jam and Lewis produced the song [...] "Separated", along with multi-platinum producers Ric Atari & Daron Jones (who also wrote the record) to which the producers then turned in to L.A. Reid, who liked the track, {{and asked them to}} produce more. Following this, Usher asked both producers to create a song similar to their 1985 [...] "Tender Love", performed by R vocal group Force MDs. Though he wanted it to be his own unique record, which contains a small similarity, to which Jam and Lewis created [...] "Can U Help Me". Following the completion of 8701, Jam and Lewis were sent back to the studio by Reid to revamp the album's second single [...] "U Remind Me", explaining [...] "we already know he can dance, and he's got the style and that whole thing. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> people to just go, he can sing.|$|E
500|$|In August, Stefani {{filed for}} divorce from her husband Gavin Rossdale after almost {{thirteen}} years of marriage. In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't feel right. [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt like I should do something in music, but what was I going to do? There wasn't enough time. So I {{tried to make a}} record where I was just kind of involved—which is how {{a lot of people do}} it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not feel right and she needed to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think I have enough for probably two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, because I feel like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to keep writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team. The album was completed in January 2016. Stefani revealed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on February 25 that [...] "'four of five' songs" [...] were written in the previous month.|$|E
500|$|On January 28, 2013, a new CGI special titled Powerpuff Girls: Dance Pantsed was {{announced}} to premiere that year, {{though it was}} later delayed to January 20, 2014. The former Beatle Ringo Starr promoted the special on Cartoon Network singing a new original song [...] "I Wish I Was a Powerpuff Girl" [...] with previews {{leading up to the}} airdate. Ringo also voiced a new character named Fibonacci Sequins in the episode. The special was directed by Dave Smith, who directed episodes for the series in the past, and featured the original cast members reprising their roles. This Powerpuff Girls special marked the first time that series creator Craig McCracken had no input. The episode's plot has Mojo Jojo kidnap Fibonacci along with an opera singer and a badger. The girls rescue all of them, and the powerpuff girls defeat Mojo yet again with his kidnapping plan. Not deterred he then goes on to invent an evil video game called [...] "Dance Pants R-EVILution" [...] to take over Townsville. Common Sense Media gave the special 3/5 stars citing the [...] "tasteful update of the original animation style" [...] however recommends it for older kids around the age of 7. GON (Geeked Out Nation) gave the show a B rank and described it as [...] "...a good special with the return of the characters that many of us grew up [...] ", while they said that the special has few flaws.

500|$|During {{the first}} work by Shinichirō Watanabe on Cowboy Bebop, the first image {{that came to}} him was of Spike. Prior to that, Watanabe had the {{character}} of Spike in mind {{for a long time}} beforehand. From that point on, Watanabe [...] "tried to build a story around him, trying to make him cool." [...] Watanabe created Spike as a mirror image of himself: in Watanabe's words, [...] "I don't smoke or drink or fight, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to – so Spike does." [...] Spike forms the main focus on the series, with the central theme being his past and its karmic effect on him. Spike was portrayed as a [...] "typical old-style Japanese man", who would simply do what he wanted and expect others to follow his lead and watch him from the sidelines. Spike's artificial eye was included as Watanabe wanted his characters to have flaws. He was originally going to give Spike an eye patch, but the producers vetoed it. In order to portray him as cool, Toshihiro Kawamoto designed Spike to look [...] "uncool": when he stands still, he has a hunched appearance. This meant that when the character was moving vigorously, he came across as [...] "extra cool". Spike's appearance was primarily based on the main protagonist of Tantei Monogatari, portrayed by famous Japanese actor Yusaku Matsuda. Although Yamadera was a fan of Matsuda's, he avoided imitating his distinctive manner of speaking, noting that it [...] "wouldn't have sounded right" [...] for Spike. Spike's Swordfish II spaceship was created by mecha designer Kimitoshi Yamane. Yamane liked the English biplane torpedo-bomber Fairey Swordfish, which led him to name the Swordfish II after the bomber. The conclusion of Spike's story and his final battle with Vicious were planned by Watanabe well in advance, with each episode featuring them meant to shadow their final confrontation. Some of the staff were unhappy about this approach as a continuation of the series would be difficult. While he considered altering the ending, he eventually settled with his original idea.|$|E
