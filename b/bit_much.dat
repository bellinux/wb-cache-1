5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a <b>bit</b> <b>much.</b>|$|E
25|$|John Levesque, Seattle Post-Intelligencer (April 20, 2001) — Like so many {{characters}} in noir-ish {{films of the}} 1940s and 1950s, Wolfe and Goodwin are ebulliently over the top: loud, proud and full of themselves. It's a <b>bit</b> <b>much</b> for anyone expecting the less theatrical performances of today. And yet it fits remarkably well with today's reality programming. Wolfe, after all, is ruder than anyone on Survivor.|$|E
500|$|Mark Beaumont of NME {{praised the}} album, writing that [...] "by {{the time the}} {{affecting}} acoustic lament 'Butterfly' wafts in like Big Star at a wildlife protection meeting, Pinkerton starts feeling like a truly moving album." [...] Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork awarded the album 7.5 out of 10, writing that [...] "Pinkerton might actually be a <b>bit</b> <b>much</b> for fans who were wooed with the clean production and immediately accessible sound of these guys' debut, but if given a chance, it might surprise even some anti-Weezer folk." ...|$|E

Very often, very high resolution cameras are employed to gain as much direct information as possible. Cryogenic cooling is also common, to minimise noise.

500|$|In May 1968, John Lennon and {{his wife}} Cynthia Lennon {{separated}} after John's affair with Yoko Ono. The following month, Paul McCartney drove out to visit Cynthia and John's son, Julian, at Kenwood, the family's home in Weybridge. Cynthia {{had been part of}} the Beatles' social circle since before the band's rise to fame in 1963; McCartney later said he found it [...] "a <b>bit</b> <b>much</b> for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life." [...] Cynthia Lennon recalled of McCartney's surprise visit: [...] "I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{opinion was}} divided on Aniston's {{performance}} as Claire. TV Guides Matt Mitovich wrote that Aniston [...] "looked sweet, but the role was juuuuust a <b>bit</b> <b>much...</b> over-the-top." [...] Jeremy Medina of Paste {{said that the}} show did not really {{seem to know what}} to do with Aniston in this episode. Tom Stempel for Slant Magazine said 30 Rock was [...] "smart enough" [...] not to make Claire resemble Aniston's former television character, Rachel, from Friends. Further in his review, Stempel said that Claire was a [...] "great choice of character" [...] for Aniston to play, and praised her for knocking the role [...] "out of the park." [...] Kerrie Murphy for The Australian was equally positive noting that Aniston fits in smoothly as Liz's former roommate. Murphy added, [...] "Not only is it a reminder that Aniston is a gifted comic actor [...] With her, the show's regular cast easily hold their own." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the episode}} [...] "Hairography" [...] in which Rachel is badly made-over by Kurt, Mike Hale of The New York Times noted a popular theme amongst critics for {{negatively}} highlighting the way Glee treats its female characters. He {{said that while}} he understood this stance, he generally disagreed with it as the show treats male characters equally poorly. However, he wrote that [...] "it was a <b>bit</b> <b>much</b> when Finn looked at Rachel in her catsuit and frizzy hair and said {{she looked like a}} 'sad clown hooker.' Come on. She looked fantastic." [...] Zap2it's Korbi Ghosh has deemed Rachel's high point on the show romancing of Finn and Puck, commenting: [...] "when we saw Rachel fall for them, she was actually relatable. Likable even. The type-A, uber-talented, self-involved know-it-all who's usually alienating her classmates let her guard down to expose a vulnerable side. And, as a bonus, we got some super solid musical performances from those awkward courtships." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cheech & Chong's Greatest Hit is {{a comedy}} album by Cheech & Chong. The album is a [...] "greatest hits" [...] compilation, {{featuring}} {{some of their}} best known comedy <b>bits.</b> <b>Much</b> to some fans' disliking, some tracks were edited for this release: most notably, the 1:34 track [...] "Dave" [...] is broken into two separate tracks, and is edited down for time. Also, [...] "Earache My Eye" [...] fades out just {{before the start of}} the argument between father and son.|$|R

500|$|She {{lived for}} a few months in a flat Starr owned at 34 Montagu Square, central London, but {{returned}} to Kenwood as Lennon and Ono preferred to live there instead, rather than in isolated Weybridge. Lennon and Cynthia had one last short meeting at Kenwood (with Ono alongside Lennon), where Lennon accused her of having an affair in India, saying she was no [...] "innocent little flower". McCartney visited her and Julian that year, and on the way to Kenwood he composed a song in his head which later became [...] "Hey Jude". Talking about their divorce, McCartney later said: [...] "We'd been very good friends for millions of years and I thought it was a <b>bit</b> <b>much</b> for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life". Cynthia recalled, [...] "I was truly surprised when, one afternoon, Paul arrived on his own. I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us." [...] She was once asked if Lennon had written any songs about their time together, and answered: [...] "It was too sloppy when you were young to dedicate anything to anybody. Macho Northern men didn't do that in those days". In contrast, Lennon said he wrote the 1965 song [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" [...] about an affair he was having, but rendered it in [...] "gobbledegook" [...] so Cynthia would not know.|$|E
500|$|Franks {{said that}} after her stint in 2008, many people {{recognised}} her {{in the street and}} asked if she would return. Scenes showing Phil and Rainie taking the drug crack cocaine in 2010 prompted over 200 complaints from viewers who felt the scenes were inappropriate. The BBC responded by saying [...] "EastEnders in no way—and at no point—glamorises or condones the use of drugs, and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs. [...] We took care to signal the nature of the episode's content to viewers in advance through programme publicity and billings, and the BBC Action Line was trailed following the episode for anyone affected by the issue. In addition to this, our website includes links to organisations who can offer help and advice on this issue. [...] We worked closely with drug and alcohol charities, including Addaction and DrugScope, throughout the editorial process to ensure that we handled the storyline accurately and sensitively." [...] The Daily Mail asked some viewers about the scenes, including one who said, [...] "I was shocked at the content of the episode. The graphic detail of the drug use with Phil and his friend was terrible and in view of the time that the episode was aired, entirely inappropriate. Viewers do not need to see this kind of storyline. Please, BBC, no more of these horrid storylines." [...] Other viewers said, [...] "They look like they're having a good time. They're in danger of making it look appealing." [...] Finally, [...] "It was a <b>bit</b> <b>much.</b> I've found EastEnders distressing over the last month." [...] The Daily Record described the scenes as 'disturbing'.|$|E
500|$|The two Vocal Adrenaline {{performances}} were generally very well received; as noted above, Bell and Chaney used very similar words {{to explain why}} they thought Vocal Adrenaline was [...] "better" [...] than New Directions. [...] "Starships", the first number, was also the more praised of the two: Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said that it [...] "stole the show" [...] for him, and was the best musical number of the night. Flandez called it [...] "an electric and sassy delivery" [...] by Unique, and Strecker asked [...] "is there anything she can't do" [...] before she gave the performance an [...] "A−". Futterman thought it felt [...] "more subdued than the warp-speed of Minaj's hit" [...] though she added that the [...] "stage acrobatics trump everything anyone else does", and Saskin said it [...] "was fun to watch, but the vocals don't add much to the original version". Slezak gave it an [...] "A" [...] grade and praised the [...] "dazzling" [...] choreography of both numbers. [...] "Pinball Wizard" [...] was called [...] "turbo-charged from beginning to end" [...] by Flandez, and both Strecker and Slezak gave the song a [...] "B+" [...] grade; the former's enthusiasm was tempered by the arrangement, which was not very [...] "different from just karaoke of the original", and the dancing on the pinball machines as [...] "a <b>bit</b> <b>much</b> for my taste". Futterman said that Unique [...] "riffs the hell out the song", but added that [...] "the robot dancers of Vocal Adrenaline {{make it hard to}} glean any personality from the performance". Dodge wrote, [...] "This one I'm liking even less than the first", but Saskin said, [...] "Mercedes needs to watch out, because Unique sure can belt it out!" ...|$|E

2500|$|As he was {{struggling}} {{to cope with the}} captaincy and his role as an all-rounder, Shakib gave up the captaincy in July 2010 to focus on his own performance. Mashrafe Mortaza returned to take charge in ODIs. Coach Jamie Siddons explained that [...] "Shakib was the main person behind the decision, he decided it was a <b>bit</b> <b>much</b> for him. His form was down with the bat and he needed a rest." [...] Bangladesh returned to England for the ODI half of their tour. Bangladesh lost the series 2–1, but their victory in the second match was the first time Bangladesh had beaten England in international cricket. While in Europe, Bangladesh were scheduled to play two ODIs against Ireland, and one each against Scotland and Netherlands. The match against Scotland was abandoned and Bangladesh lost one match to each of Ireland and the Netherlands.|$|E
2500|$|... "Mercy" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics.

Friday singles – it's nowhere near as much fun as [...] "Good Friday" [...] or as seductive as [...] "Devil in a New Dress". Amy Sciarretto of Popcrush stated that the track was [...] "great", and that [...] "even with four rappers laying down verses on the song, it's a compact, tightly constructed tune that feels like a series of freestyle raps that flow into one another flawlessly." [...] Corban Goble of Stereogum mused that the song [...] "is a giant, lurching thing where the rappers trade bravado-filled verses around a syrup-music inspired hook." [...] Jayson Rodriguez of XXL stated that [...] "the public may have seen this idea and presentation before, but the music is still next level. It's fitting that Kanye could bring together this cast and execute the finished product this well. Still, Wednesday's spontaneous release of [...] "Cold" [...] was a <b>bit</b> <b>much</b> more exhilarating both musically and dramatically." [...] Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! mused that [...] "the track most likely sounds just as you'd expect, all expensive, epic-sounding production, some slowed-down samples and an aggressive synth beat. There's also an appearance of Kanye's obnoxious new trademark huuuuh?" [...] Kia Makarechi of The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "lyrically, 'Mercy' doesn't have much to it, but it's a competent piece of braggadocio." ...|$|E
