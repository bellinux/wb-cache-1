25|$|The band's sound {{usually has}} {{elements}} of punk rock, pop and alternative rock. I <b>Brought</b> <b>You</b> My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, the band's debut album, features a raw sound that has guitar riffs, very energetic vocals and sometimes screaming. The album {{is considered an}} emo album with strong influences from punk rock and hardcore punk. I <b>Brought</b> <b>You</b> My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love also has some influences from heavy metal. The second album Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge {{was one of the}} albums that launched the emo genre into the mainstream. The band's album The Black Parade lacks the post-hardcore elements featured on the first two My Chemical Romance albums and features elements of pop punk, emo and punk rock. The fourth My Chemical Romance album Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys continues the band's alternative rock and pop punk sound with some new elements of power pop, pop rock and electronic rock.|$|E

Unlike the suzerainty treaty, the Decalogue does not have any witness nor explicit blessings and curses. The fullest account of the Mosaic covenant is given in the book of Deuteronomy.|$|E

500|$|The cabinet {{clashed with}} Brătianu {{when it was}} {{discovered}} that it had been negotiating in secret with the disinherited Prince Carol (a traditional adversary of the PNL) as Ferdinand's health was taking {{a turn for the worse}} (Averescu later claimed that he had been asked by Brătianu: [...] "So, after I have <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> to power, you wish to rise and dominate?"). The PNL withdrew its support, and, through an order signed by Constantin Hiott, Averescu's was replaced by the broad coalition government of Barbu Știrbey, Brătianu's brother-in-law. The general's deposition, confirmed by King Ferdinand on his deathbed, created a vacuum on the Right, soon filled by the Iron Guard, a fascist movement formed by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu (formerly an associate of Cuza's).|$|E

500|$|The Duke of York, an avowed Catholic, was {{twenty-five years}} older than his bride, scarred by {{smallpox}} and afflicted with a stutter. He had secretly converted to Catholicism around 1668. Mary first saw her husband on 23 November 1673 OS, {{on the day of}} their second marriage ceremony. James was pleased with his bride. Mary, however, at first disliked him, and burst into tears each time she saw him. Nonetheless, she soon warmed to James. From his first marriage to the commoner Anne Hyde, who had died in 1671, James had two daughters: Lady Mary and Lady Anne. They were introduced to Mary by James with the words, [...] "I have <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> a new play-fellow". [...] Unlike Lady Mary, Lady Anne disliked her father's new wife.

500|$|The episodes {{were the}} final to feature Lauren Faust as {{executive}} producer. Near {{the end of}} the first season, Faust announced that she had left the series, and for the second season, she stepped down as executive producer, to become consulting producer.

Despite her decreased participation, she still has high hopes for the staff members, stating that [...] "the gaps I have left are being filled by the same amazing artists, writers, and directors who <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> Season1. I'm certain the show will be as entertaining as ever". In addition, a new storyboard editor named Jim Miller was hired for the second season and a majority of the animation was [...] "outsourced" [...] to animation company Top Draw.

Although Baker assisted with the effects in The Exorcist (1973), Dick Smith was the makeup artist who primarily worked on that film, not Baker. Exorcist director William Friedkin was so angry about the poster that, upon seeing it on an associate's wall, he tore it down and ripped it to pieces. Baker, {{who did not know}} about the poster in advance, was horrified by the publicity campaign and publicly apologized for it, claiming: [...] "Dick wanted some help so I first went out to do some work on the dummy whose head turns around 360 degrees.

500|$|After the {{airing of}} the first season's finale, Faust {{announced}} that {{she had left the}} show, and would be credited in the future as Consulting Producer.

Despite leaving, she still has high hopes for the staff members, stating that [...] "the gaps I have left are being filled by the same amazing artists, writers, and directors who <b>brought</b> <b>you</b> Season1. I'm certain the show will be as entertaining as ever". In an interview with New York Magazine, Faust stated her reasons for leaving were a combination of a hectic production schedules and a lack of creative control she had with the series. According to her husband McCracken, Faust's departure was {{due to the fact that}} as a toy company-driven show, [...] "there were things she wanted to do with that series that she just wasn't able to do", and that there is [...] "still some frustration with" [...] not being able to bring some of her ideas to screen.|$|E
500|$|The discography of American {{recording}} artist Toni Braxton consists of seven studio albums, five extended plays, six compilation albums, two remix albums, thirty singles (including three featured singles) and twenty-two music videos. Braxton {{was born in}} Severn, Maryland on October 7, 1968. Her mother, an opera vocalist, encouraged Braxton and her four sisters to sing in church at a young age. In 1990, songwriter Bill Pettaway discovered the sisters and helped them obtain a record deal with Arista Records, as the group titled The Braxtons; the group's debut single, [...] "Good Life", was released the same year. Although the song failed to chart, Braxton's voice {{caught the attention of}} producers, L.A. Reid and Babyface, who signed her to their newly formed LaFace Records. In 1991, Braxton recorded songs for the soundtrack album of 1992 Eddie Murphy film Boomerang. Her solo debut single, [...] "Love Shoulda <b>Brought</b> <b>You</b> Home", reached the top-thirty of the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart and the top-five of the R/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Two years later, her self-titled debut album was issued through LaFace.

[...] Naval Eight's conversion to the Sopwith Triplane in April saw Little begin to score heavily, eventually registering twenty-four victories on the type to bring his total up to twenty-eight by 10July, including twin victories in a day on four occasions. He was the squadron's top scorer with the Triplane, mostly in one particular airframe, N5493, that he christened [...] "Blymp", which also became the nickname of his baby son.

A bar to his DSC had been gazetted on 29June, for [...] "exceptional daring and skill in aerial fighting on many occasions", and he received the French Croix de Guerre on 11July, becoming—along with fellow Australian RNAS ace Roderic (Stan) Dallas—one of the first three British Empire pilots to be so decorated. In August, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order [...] "for exceptional skill and daring", followed by a bar to the decoration in September for [...] "remarkable courage and boldness in attacking enemy machines".
