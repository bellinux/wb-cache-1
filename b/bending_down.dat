They sometimes carry water in their bill to chicks at the nest or even during nest building or egg stages.|$|E
25|$|Woodworkers {{seem to be}} {{evenly divided}} {{on the subject of}} bench positioning. Some {{like to be able to}} access their benches from all sides, while others like their bench against a wall. The {{advantage}} of wall placement - besides the saved space - is that tools can be stored on the wall over the bench, within easy reach. This keeps the tool storage out of the way, and the tools can still be reached without turning around or <b>bending</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E

Some designs from the Denver mint feature corn without a smaller leaf, others feature a small leaf pointing upwards, and still others have the leaf <b>bending</b> <b>down.</b> A set of all three quarters sold on eBay in February 2005 for $300 and initially saw significant increases, such as $1500 for individual coins, but as of August 2012 PCGS lists the value of MS-62 specimens as approximately $150 each.|$|E

25|$|Jessie Willcox Smith {{was born}} in the Mount Airy {{neighborhood}} of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was the youngest girl born to Charles Henry Smith, an investment broker, and Katherine DeWitt Willcox Smith. Jessie attended private elementary schools. At the age of sixteen she was sent to Cincinnati, Ohio to live with her cousins and finish her education. She trained to be a teacher and taught kindergarten in 1883. However, Smith found that the physical demands of working with children were too strenuous for her. Due to back problems, she had difficulty <b>bending</b> <b>down</b> to their level. Persuaded to attend one of her friend's or cousin's art classes, Smith realized she had a talent for drawing.|$|E
500|$|The {{survivors}} {{were interviewed}} {{for the media}} and by investigators about their experience.

500|$|The cover art to [...] "Free Free"/"Super Music Maker" [...] {{was photographed}} by Takashiro Akihisa, who also {{directed}} the accompanying music video for the song, and was revealed on July 18, 2007. There are three different artworks; the normal CD cover featured Suzuki kneeling down, whilst the DVD had her <b>bending</b> <b>down</b> {{with her back}} towards the camera. The artworks {{were placed on the}} back of the jewelcases, and the booklet featured another shot of her looking upwards; when opened, her bottom half is shown on the other side of the book. Additionally, Avex printed the booklets in a special lenticular paper that imitated the LED lights in the background of the photoshoot. This shot was then used as the official vinyl cover, tinted in pink. Taken from the video shoot, an editor for the website Sanspo compared the art to the work of Japanese recording artist Kumi Koda, where he/she described the shoot as [...] "sexy". Another reviewer, reporting from Natalie.mu, commended its [...] "decorative" [...] lights and felt it expressed the songs [...] "technopop" [...] style.|$|E

2500|$|Carimi's Italian surname {{comes from}} his {{paternal}} step-grandfather. His parents are Jewish.

Carimi is a practicing Jew and very committed to his religion, and found time as a youth to both go to his football practices and to attend Madison's Temple Beth-El, a Reform synagogue. [...] By the time of his Bar Mitzvah, he was already so tall that while blessing him, and even with Carimi <b>bending</b> <b>down,</b> the synagogue’s education director had to put his hands on Carimi’s shoulders rather than atop his head. [...] For his Bar Mitzvah project, he helped build a house for Habitat for Humanity while he was in seventh grade. Carimi continued his Jewish studies after his Bar Mitzvah.|$|E
2500|$|According to a 1998 {{article in}} the Auburn Plainsman, the most likely origin of the [...] "War Eagle" [...] cry grew from a 1913 pep rally at Langdon Hall, where {{students}} had gathered {{the day before the}} annual football game against the University of Georgia. [...] Cheerleader Gus Graydon told the crowd, [...] "If we are going to win this game, we'll have {{to get out there and}} fight, because this means war." [...] During the frenzy, another student, E. T. Enslen, dressed in his military uniform, noticed something had dropped from his hat. [...] <b>Bending</b> <b>down,</b> he saw it was the metal emblem of an eagle that had come loose during his wild cheering. [...] Someone asked him what he had found, and Enslen loudly replied, [...] "It's a War Eagle!" [...] The new cry was used by students at the game the following day.|$|E
