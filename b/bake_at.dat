25|$|Romans used tubes {{inside the}} walls to draw smoke out of {{bakeries}} but chimneys only appeared in large dwellings in northern Europe in the 12th century. The earliest extant example of an English chimney is at the keep of Conisbrough Castle in Yorkshire, which dates from 1185 AD. However, they did not become common in houses until the 16th and 17th centuries. Smoke hoods were an early method of collecting the smoke into a chimney (see image). Another step {{in the development of}} chimneys was the use of built in ovens which allowed the household to <b>bake</b> <b>at</b> home. Industrial chimneys became common in the late 18th century.|$|E

40|$|The main {{aim of the}} thesis: Effect of sweetener, {{temperature}} and cooking time on the hydroxymethylfurfural selected bakery products, {{was to determine the}} amount of hy-droxymethylfurfural in sweeteners and dough and biscuits made from them. Sweeteners used were: wheat syrup, corn syrup, date syrup, honey, sucrose, invert sugar and cane molasses. Three baking temperatures (175 °C, 200 °C, 225 °C) were used. Cookies <b>baked</b> <b>at</b> 200 °C and 225 °C, were sensorially evaluated. The highest amounts of HMF were found in invert sugar, less amounts in cane molasses and honey. The amounts of HMF were increasing with temperature baking for invert sugar´s biscuits and date syrup´s biscuits. The firmest biscuits, tested by TIRATEST, were biscuits with sucrose <b>baked</b> <b>at</b> 175 °C. Biscuits <b>baked</b> <b>at</b> 200 °C showed better sensory evaluation of acceptability than the biscuits <b>baked</b> <b>at</b> 225 °C.

60|$|There is {{an equally}} {{strong case for}} a public {{handling}} of bakehouses and the bread supply. Already the public is put to great and entirely unremunerative expense in inspecting and checking weights and hunting down the grosser instances of adulteration, grubbiness and dirt, and with it all the common bakehouse remains {{for the most part}} a subterranean haunt of rats, mice and cockroaches, and the ordinary baker's bread is so insipid and unnutritious that a great number of more prosperous people now-a-days find it advantageous to health and pocket alike to <b>bake</b> <b>at</b> home. A considerable amount of physical degeneration may be connected with the general poorness of our bread. The plain fact of the case is that our population will never get good wholesome bread from the Private Owner's bakehouse, until it employs one skilled official to watch every half-dozen bakers--and another to watch him; and it seems altogether saner and cheaper to abolish the Private Owner in this business also and do the job cleanly, honestly and straightforwardly in proper buildings with properly paid labour as a public concern.|$|E
40|$|The most {{effective}} economical baking conditions w ere determined for foundry cores bonded with the grade 3 Nigerian acacia species exudates.

The result were compared with established standard foundry core property table which showed that the class V iron/steel cores are best made with 3 % acacia bonded silica sand <b>baked</b> <b>at</b> 160 ºC for 1 h. For magnesium cores, sand bonded with 4. 5 % acacia <b>baked</b> <b>at</b> 160 ºC for 1 - 2 h was optimum.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the photocatalytic oxidation of gas-phase trichloroethylene (TCE) and 2 -propanol, at indoor levels, over titanium dioxide (TiO 2) irradiated with light-emitting diodes (LED) under different operational conditions. TiO 2 powder <b>baked</b> <b>at</b> 450 &# 176;C exhibited the highest photocatalytic decomposition efficiency (PDE) for TCE, while all photocatalysts <b>baked</b> <b>at</b> different temperatures showed similar PDEs for 2 -propanol. The average PDEs of TCE over a three hour period were four, four, five, and 51 % for TiO 2 powders <b>baked</b> <b>at</b> 150, 250, 350, and 450 &# 176;C, respectively. The average PDEs of 2 -propanol were 95, 97, 98, and 96 % for TiO 2 powders <b>baked</b> <b>at</b> 150, 250, 350, and 450 &# 176;C, respectively.

Although the LED-irradiated TiO 2 system revealed lower PDEs of TCE and 2 -propanol when compared {{to those of the}} eight watt, black-light lamp-irradiated TiO 2 system, the results for the PDEs normalized to the energy consumption were reversed. Other operational parameters, such as relative humidity, input concentrations, flow rate, and feeding type were also found to influence the photocatalytic performance of the UV LED-irradiated TiO 2 system when applied to the cleaning of TCE and 2 -propanol at indoor air levels...|$|R

50|$|Bread {{is a very}} {{important}} part of the Danish table. It is enjoyed at home, in the workplace or in restaurants and is usually based primarily on rugbrød, which is sour-dough rye bread. It is a dark, heavy bread which is sometimes bought pre-sliced, in varieties from light-colored rye, to very dark, and refined to whole grain. Rugbrød forms the basis of smørrebrød (see above). Many people still <b>bake</b> <b>at</b> home, particularly boller, which are small bread rolls, and often the traditional kringle, which is a pastry filled with Zante currants and remonce paste. The Danish franskbrød (lit: French-bread) are leavened wheat breads, roughly equivalent to white bread. Franskbrød are available in many varieties, ranging from whole wheat to pumpkin, chestnut, or poppy-seed sprinked loaves and loaves containing maize, müsli or honey. Some loaves are made with alternative wheat sorts like emmer or spelt and some contains small amounts of low-gluten grains such rye. Leavened brown loaves are also referred to as franskbrød. People often eat jam with cheese on crusty white bread for breakfast, and also very thin slices of chocolate, called pålægschokolade. Because of the popular rye bread, Danes eat less wheat bread than most other western countries, even though bread is part of most daily meals.|$|E
