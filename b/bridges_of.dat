5|$|Contracts {{to build}} the Fort Henry Bridge were let to the American Bridge Company, a {{subsidiary}} of U.S. Steel, and Dravo Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Costing $6.8million, $1.8million over budget, and taking four years to complete, the Fort Henry Bridge opened to traffic on September 8, 1955 after a ribbon-cutting ceremony with then-governor William C. Marland {{in front of a}} crowd of 55,000 to 60,000 people. The bridge earned an Honorable Mention in 1955 from the National Steel Bridge Alliance, a part of the American Institute of Steel Construction, which recognizes the best steel <b>bridges</b> <b>of</b> the year. At the time of construction, the bridge was only the second tied-arch bridge across the Ohio River.|$|E
5|$|In 1735, Euler {{presented}} {{a solution to}} the problem known as the Seven <b>Bridges</b> <b>of</b> Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of planar graph theory.|$|E

5|$|The roads the Muisca {{merchants and}} xeques used to {{traverse}} the Altiplano and access surrounding areas, were dug {{in the top}} soil without pavement, making them hard to recognise in the archaeological record. The roads leading to the religious sites, such as Lake Tota, were marked with stones surrounding the pathway, which are still visible today. Cable <b>bridges</b> <b>of</b> vines and bamboo connected {{the banks of the}} many rivers of the Andes. The roads crossing the mountains of the Eastern Ranges were narrow, which created a problem for the Spanish conquistadors who used horses to travel long distances.|$|E
5|$|For {{his work}} in the Western film Unforgiven (1992) and the sports drama Million Dollar Baby (2004), Eastwood won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture, as well as {{receiving}} nominations for Best Actor. Eastwood's greatest commercial successes have been the adventure comedy Every Which Way But Loose (1978) and its sequel, the action comedy Any Which Way You Can (1980), after adjustment for inflation. Other popular films include the Western Hang 'Em High (1968), the psychological thriller Play Misty for Me (1971), the crime film Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974), the Western The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), the prison film Escape from Alcatraz (1979), the action film Firefox (1982), the suspense thriller Tightrope (1984), the Western Pale Rider (1985), the war films Where Eagles Dare (1968), Kelly's Heroes (1970), Heartbreak Ridge (1986), the action thriller In the Line of Fire (1993), the romantic drama The <b>Bridges</b> <b>of</b> Madison County (1995), and the drama Gran Torino (2008).|$|E

5|$|In spring, 1813, {{the army}} {{returned}} to the offensive, leaving Portugal and marching northwards through Spain to Vitoria where the French stood in preparation for battle, which took place on 21 June. The Light Division held {{the centre of the}} Allied line, and took the <b>bridges</b> <b>of</b> Villodas and Tres Puentes. The battle proved an overwhelming victory for the British, and the following day the 1/52nd, with the Light Division, were sent in pursuit of the retreating French, skirmishing with the enemy rearguard. In August, volunteers from the 1/52nd were involved in the storming of San Sebastian. The 1/52nd crossed into France on 7 October, when they stormed redoubts above Vera. The 1/52nd also fought in the battles at Nivelle (November 1813), Nive (December 1813) and Orthes (February 1814). During the battle of Orthes, the 52nd led an assault up the ridge under heavy fire, an advance which was later described by Sir Harry Smith as the most majestic he had ever seen.|$|E
5|$|The 4th North Korean Division, meanwhile, had {{constructed}} underwater <b>bridges</b> <b>of</b> sandbags, logs, and rocks, finishing {{the first on}} August 10. 4th Division used it to move trucks and heavy artillery as well as additional infantry and a few tanks across the river. By the morning of August 10, an estimated two KPA regiments were across the river and occupying fortified positions. Supplies continued to stream in through rafts. Task Force Hill mounted its attack, but was once again unable to make progress due to the newly established artillery. Its directive to attack quickly became one to dig in and hold its ground, and by nightfall the entire 4th North Korean Division was across the river. On August 10, elements of 4th North Korean began to move south, outflanking Task Force Hill. The next day, scattered North Korean elements attacked Yongsan. KPA repeatedly attacked at night, when American soldiers were resting and had greater difficulty resisting.|$|E
5|$|The NK 4th Division {{had in the}} {{meantime}} constructed underwater <b>bridges</b> <b>of</b> sandbags, logs and rocks, finishing the first one the day before. It moved trucks and heavy artillery across the river over this bridge, as well as additional infantry and a few tanks. By the morning of 10 August close to two full North Korean regiments were across the river and occupying fortified positions. After a series of unsuccessful counterattacks, the threat to Yongsan necessitated more U.S. reinforcements. As U.S. casualties mounted, a frustrated Walker ordered the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the area. They mounted a massive offensive on Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni beginning at 08:00 on 17 August, unleashing all available heavy weapons: artillery, mortars, M26 Pershing tanks, and airstrikes.|$|E

5|$|The {{surrounding}} {{soils are}} mostly a strong, brown, dry earth, well adapted for arable farming {{and the growing}} of grains of all kinds {{that contributed to the}} area being a mostly farming community until the modern era. Soils were further enriched over the millennia by alluvial deposits from the River Taff. The bedrock under the whole area is predominantly sandstone, dating from both the Devonian period (Old Red Sandstone) and the Triassic (New Red Sandstone) laid down in arid conditions. These may subsequently have been ground down by the Taff valley glacier during the last ice age around 18,000 years ago. Radyr Stone is a Triassic breccia used widely for decorative work in the Cardiff area, including Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff Docks and in the <b>bridges</b> <b>of</b> the Taff Vale Railway.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Streep starred {{opposite}} Clint Eastwood as an unhappily {{married woman}} in The <b>Bridges</b> <b>of</b> Madison County, her biggest critical and commercial {{success of the}} decade. Although her dramas of the late 1990s received a mixed reception overall, she was praised {{for her role as}} a cancer patient in One True Thing (1998). She had acclaimed roles in the 2002 films Adaptation and The Hours, and won a second Emmy Award for the television miniseries Angels in America a year later, though she failed to replicate her earlier success. This changed in 2006, with an Academy Award-nominated role as a ruthless fashion magazine editor in the comedy-drama The Devil Wears Prada. This late-period success led to starring roles in several high-profile films, including the US$609 million-grossing romantic comedy Mamma Mia! (2008), her highest-grossing release, and the comedy-drama Julie & Julia (2009), in which she played Julia Child. These roles re-established Streep's stardom in Hollywood. Her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in the biopic The Iron Lady (2011) earned her another Academy Award for Best Actress. The starring role of Florence Foster Jenkins in the 2016 comedy-drama film of the same name garnered Streep her 20th Oscar nomination, more than any actor or actress in history.|$|E
5|$|The ancient font by {{the west}} door dates from the twelfth century, and has an arcaded basin. The plain pointed arch forms the only {{ornament}} on the font, which has an octagonal ashlar shaft now mounted on a platform, and supporting the octagonal basin. Unfortunately the font has been subject to extensive and clumsy repair. Unusually, it is made of Purbeck marble, which is normally found in churches in south and eastern England; the only other example in Wales is in St David's Cathedral. Documentary {{evidence suggests that the}} massive stem dates from at least the nineteenth century, and stylistic evidence suggests that it is probably a lot earlier; the font basin itself is undoubtedly ancient. Seddon's restoration work in the church commenced in 1869, and included dismantling the font. He carefully cleaned and stored the stonework, and re-erected it on new platform of Radyr conglomerate stone. Radyr Stone is a Triassic breccia used widely for decorative work in the Cardiff area, including Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff Docks and in the <b>bridges</b> <b>of</b> the Taff Vale Railway. The font previously stood on a three step platform, in the same position as it now stands. The font cover is nineteenth century, in oak and wrought iron.|$|E

5|$|With {{the opening}} of the New York – Pennsylvania Joint Bridge Commission, a {{predecessor}} of the current Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, in the 1920s to buy out these bridges from private ownership, the tolls along the <b>bridges</b> <b>of</b> the Delaware were beginning to come to an end. The Commission offered the Bridge Company an offer of $19,542.22 (1920s USD). The company took the offer and under new ownership, the tolls were eliminated. The bridge had more activity after the elimination of tolls and business continued to prosper. With the new owners, the bridge was kept under routine maintenance, and the bridge has continued to maintain a strong structure. Even with the floods from Hurricanes Connie and Diane of 1955 and the 1960s, the bridge survived with little to no structural damage. From May to October 1986, the commission closed the bridge to do some renovations. The wooden deck was replaced, the entire bridge was painted, and new guide rails were constructed. The only thing is that the 3 ton (6000lb) weight limit remained after the revamping. On November 14, 1988, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
