5|$|Tracing {{is divided}} into two forms, common law tracing and {{equitable}} tracing. Common law tracing relies on the claimant having legal ownership of the property, and will fail if the property has been mixed with other property, the legal title has been transferred to the defendant, or the legal title has <b>been</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>by</b> the defendant to any further recipient of the property. Equitable tracing, on the other hand, relies on the claimant having an equitable interest in the property, and can succeed where the property has been mixed with other property.|$|E

25|$|A colonial Assembly {{was created}} in October 1683. New York {{was the last of}} the English colonies to have an {{assembly}}. The assembly passed the Province of New York constitution on October 30, {{the first of its kind}} in the colonies. This constitution gave New Yorkers more rights than any other group of colonists including the protection from taxation without representation. On November 1, 1683, the government was reorganized, and the state was divided into twelve counties, each of which was subdivided into towns. Ten of those counties still exist (see above), but two (Cornwall and Dukes) were in territory purchased by the Duke of York from the Earl of Stirling, and are no longer within the territory of the State of New York, having <b>been</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>by</b> treaty to Massachusetts. While the number of counties has been increased to 62, the pattern still remains that a town in New York State is a subdivision of a county, similar to New England.|$|E

25|$|The federal {{government}} asked on April 6, 1879, {{that the jury}} verdict be set aside {{on the basis of}} the Supreme Court's ruling in Carr v. United States, 98 U.S. 433, (a decision handed down on March 3, after the jury's verdict had been reached). Carr v. United States involved a case where the city of San Francisco, California, transferred title to property within the city to the {{federal government}} even though a private citizen claimed title to the land. The Supreme Court reaffirmed in Carr that the federal government cannot be sued without its consent, that a suit against an officer or agent of the federal government does not bind the government itself, and that courts do not have jurisdiction over title suits against the federal government's officers and agents. Only when property has <b>been</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>by</b> the courts does a private citizen establish a right to establish or reclaim rights to title. But the circuit court in Lee held that much of the decision in Carr was dicta, and reaffirmed the jury decision.|$|E

500|$|Equitable tracing's {{greatest}} strength {{is its ability}} to trace into mixtures of money. Different rules apply in different situations; where the money has been mixed with the money of a trustee, where a trust fund has been mixed with another trust fund (or money belonging to an innocent volunteer), and where money has <b>been</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>by</b> mistake rather than malicious intent. Where the money has been mixed with the money of a trustee, the court's decision depends on the motive of the trustee. Because a trustee is expected to invest trust property and behave honestly, the courts may choose to find that the trustee transferred the money to further the goal of the trust. Since the trustee is assumed to behave honestly, any profits made may be assumed (by this [...] "convenient fiction") to be made by the trust money, and any losses from the trustee's personal funds.|$|E

2500|$|Ukrainian {{officials}} said that Russia had allowed tanks to cross the Russo-Ukrainian border into Donetsk Oblast on 11 June. Internal Affairs Minister Arsen Avakov said [...] "we have observed columns passing with armoured personnel carriers, other armoured vehicles and artillery pieces, and tanks which, according to our information, came across the border and this morning were in Snizhne". He continued by saying Ukrainian forces had destroyed part of the column, and that fighting was still under way. Reuters correspondents confirmed the presence of three tanks in Donetsk city, and the US State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research also said that Russia had indeed sent tanks, along with other heavy weapons, to the separatists in Ukraine. The weapons sent are said to include: a column of three T-64 tanks, several BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers, and other military vehicles. [...] "Russia will claim these tanks were taken from Ukrainian forces, but no Ukrainian tank units have been operating in that area," [...] the State Department said in a statement. [...] "We are confident that these tanks came from Russia." [...] The newly elected Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, {{said that it was}} [...] "unacceptable" [...] for tanks to be crossing into Ukraine. Russia called the reports [...] "another fake piece of information." [...] Nevertheless, the three tanks were later spotted moving through Makiivka and Torez, flying the flag of the Russian Federation. Insurgents confirmed that they had obtained three tanks, but leaders refused to elaborate on how they acquired them; one militant told reporters that they originated [...] "from a military warehouse." [...] The president of the DPR, Denis Pushilin, stated that the three tanks would be stationed in Donetsk city, and that they gave his forces [...] "at least some hope of defending [...] because heavy weapons are already being used against us." [...] Konstantin Mashovets, a former Ukrainian Defence Ministry official, said the tanks had likely been seized by Russian forces in Crimea before making their way into mainland Ukraine. Anton Heraschenko, an advisor to Arsen Avakov, confirmed at a briefing in Kiev that the tanks were once in the possession of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Crimea, and that they had <b>been</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>by</b> sea to Russia before crossing the border into Ukraine.|$|E

This personage, the Merlin of Scotland, and to whom some of the adventures which the British bards assigned to Merlin Caledonius, or the Wild, have <b>been</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>by</b> tradition, was, as is well known, a magician, as well as a poet and prophet.

60|$|The laws of {{inheritance}} seem to {{be nearly}} the same with seminal and bud- varieties. We know how commonly reversion comes into play with both, and it may affect the whole, or only segments of a leaf, flower, or fruit. When the tendency to reversion affects many buds on the same tree, it becomes covered with different kinds of leaves, flowers, or fruit; but {{there is reason to}} believe that such fluctuating varieties have generally arisen from seed. It is well known that, out of a number of seedling varieties, some transmit their character much more truly by seed than others; so with bud-varieties, some retain their character by successive buds more truly than others; of which instances have been given with two kinds of variegated Euonymus and with certain kinds of tulips and pelargoniums. Notwithstanding the sudden production of bud-varieties, the characters thus acquired are sometimes capable of transmission by seminal reproduction: Mr. Rivers has found that moss-roses generally reproduce themselves by seed; and the mossy character has <b>been</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>by</b> crossing from one species of rose to another. The Boston nectarine, which appeared as a bud- variation, produced by seed a closely allied nectarine. On the other hand, seedlings from some bud-variations have proved variable to an extreme degree. (11/159. Carriere 'Production des Varietes' page 39.) We have also heard, on the authority of Mr. Salter, that seeds taken from a branch with leaves variegated through bud-variation, transmit this character very feebly; whilst many plants, which were variegated as seedlings, transmit variegation to a large proportion of their progeny.|$|E
