60|$|Of course, it {{soon became}} {{apparent}} to his employer {{that there was a}} great change for the worse in the youth, whom he not only admired for his frank <b>bearing</b> and <b>strapping</b> appearance, but loved as his deliverer from death. Delicacy of feeling, however, prevented Mr Blurt from alluding to dissipations at which he could only guess.|$|R
40|$|International audienceInsertion of PbII into a {{porphyrin}} <b>bearing</b> 5, 15 <b>straps</b> with a pendant carboxylate {{group led}} to the first homobimetallic porphyrin complex of a divalent metal ion, which belongs to class III/type M in Buchler's classification of metalloporphyrins (see picture). Since the ligand also readily coordinates the isoelectronic BiIII ion, it is of potential interest as a chelator for 212 Pb/ 212 Bi isotope generators...|$|R
5000|$|According to the North China Herald, the Bodyguard wore blue uniforms with scarlet facings {{and green}} {{shoulder}} <b>straps</b> <b>bearing</b> unit identification in Chinese characters. Artillerymen wore light blue uniforms with red facings and trouser stripes. Infantry wore dark green in winter dress with red facings and shoulder straps in regimental colours. In summer all branches wore white uniforms with scarlet facings. All units wore green turbans.|$|R
40|$|As part of {{a program}} aimed at {{introducing}} functionality onto the Tröger's base framework post-synthesis, we investigated the formylation reaction of Tröger's base analogues with Vilsmeier reagents. We found that rather than the anticipated reaction at the aryl rings, these compounds react with Vilsmeier reagents to afford compounds with a modified strap, whereby the apical methylene group {{is replaced by a}} methylene <b>strap</b> <b>bearing</b> an N,N-disubstituted amine. 6 page(s...|$|R
50|$|The {{coloured}} side hat of scarlet, piped {{with gold}}, and rifle green flaps piped with gold with scarlet tipped peak and two buttons, worn by officers and soldiers off duty, was retained {{and continues to}} be listed in the Army's Dress Regulations. Officers caps have an embroidered cap badge, in gold on rifle green cloth, of an oval <b>strap</b> <b>bearing</b> the motto Pro Aris et Focis, in the centre the cypher MYC, and the whole ensigned by St Edward's crown.|$|R
5000|$|Music {{historian}} James Fuld {{notes that}} [...] "the word jingle {{in the title}} and opening phrase is apparently an imperative verb." [...] In the winter in New England in pre-automobile days, it was common to adorn horses' harnesses with <b>straps</b> <b>bearing</b> bells {{as a way to}} avoid collisions at blind intersections, since a horse-drawn sleigh in snow makes almost no noise. The rhythm of the tune mimics that of a trotting horse's bells. However, [...] "jingle bells" [...] is commonly taken to mean a certain kind of bell.|$|R
2500|$|The PLA {{apparently}} never {{devised a}} system of rank, branch or unit insignia of their own, although its personnel did wore a variety of field recognition signs. Berets were worn with the standard PLA cap badge placed above the right eye. Issued in gilt metal for all-ranks, it was sometimes found pinned to Soviet sun hats and Baseball caps. White, red, olive green and black T-shirts stamped with either the PSP crest, the PLA badge or the Party leaders' effigy were commonly worn by Druze fighters. A red brassard of roughly triangular shape and attached to a shoulder <b>strap,</b> <b>bearing</b> the stamped full-colour Progressive Socialist Party crest with the initials [...] "PSP" [...] below and surmounted by the inscription [...] "People's Liberation Army" [...] in Arabic script, was worn on the left arm.|$|R
5000|$|The regimental badge is of a punga tree {{encircled by}} a baggage <b>strap,</b> <b>bearing</b> (above) Queen Alexandra's and (below) 2nd W.W.C (Wellington West Coast) Mtd Rifles. Below {{this is the}} regiments motto [...] "Ake Ake Kia Kaha" [...] meaning [...] "For ever and ever, be strong". This {{was derived from the}} war-cry of the Third (Rough Riders) Contingent of the South African Volunteers (Boer War). The {{original}} prototypes were made of solid copper, but when issued were of blackened gunmetal. The badge is worn on the New Zealand Army rifle green beret, with RNZAC personnel wearing the badge over the RNZAC green patch. Collar badges of the same pattern are worn with No.2 Dress (mess kit), and No.4 Dress (service dress). The QAMR belt has horizontal stripes of black, amber, black. These colours are those of the Taranaki provincial colours which were adopted by the regiment. In 1993, for ceremonial purposes, the traditional mounted rifles slouch hat was reintroduced with a khaki/green/khaki puggaree. The scarlet and blue mess uniform is that of the RNZAC.|$|R
5000|$|Footwear {{was equally}} diverse. Black leather combat boots came from Lebanese Army stocks or were {{provided}} by the Syrians, complemented by Israeli black or brown leather paratrooper boots captured from the Lebanese Forces and Syrian high-top Pataugas olive canvas-and-rubber patrol boots. Several models of civilian sneakers or [...] "trainers" [...] and rubber gumboots were also used by PLA militiamen.

500|$|The {{church is}} built from irregularly {{positioned}} pieces of rubble masonry, and Kennedy added red sandstone dressings in his 1882 work. The nave measures 50feet 3inches long by 17feet 3inches wide (about 15.3 by 5.3m); the chancel {{is the same}} width, and about [...] long. [...] The chapel is 17feet by 20feet 6inches (about 5.2 by 6.25m). There is medieval masonry {{in three of the}} walls: the west wall, and the lower parts of the north and south walls. The roof is made of slate, with a stone bellcote containing one bell at the west end. Inside, the wooden trusses of the roof are visible. The trusses were re-used when the roof was reconstructed. The church is entered through a porch on the south side, added in the 19th century, and a Tudor arch doorway; the porch contains a stone piscina (a water basin), said {{to be part of a}} font dating from the 12th century. [...] An old entrance in the north wall of the nave has been blocked up. [...] Two of the three windows in the north wall are from the 19th century. [...] The third, nearest to the east end, is from the early 17th century and has a square frame. The eight-sided font also dates from the 19th century. The 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire also recorded the existence of an oak poor box, with iron <b>straps,</b> <b>bearing</b> the date of 1740, and a plain silver cup from about 1685.|$|R
