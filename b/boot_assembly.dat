5000|$|The Z-1 suit {{consists}} of a soft upper torso, soft lower torso, glove assembly, <b>boot</b> <b>assembly</b> and hemispherical dome helmet. Z-1 is called a [...] "soft" [...] suit because when unpressurized its primary structures are pliable fabrics, although it does have several hard mobility elements. The suit has a mass of 126 lb, with the suitport interface plate (SIP) it is 154 lb, and with the SIP and Portable Life Support System (PLSS) mock-up it is 162 lb.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Configuration Two" [...] suit, {{to be used}} {{primarily}} for lunar EVAs conducted during the initial 7- to 10-day lunar sortie missions and later for 3 to 6-month lunar outpost missions, will consist of a completely new spacesuit, similar in appearance to both the Mark III and I-Suits designed and tested by ILC Dover in the early 2000s, but will incorporate the arms, legs, gloves, <b>boot</b> <b>assemblies,</b> and helmet from the [...] "Configuration One" [...] suit.|$|R
2500|$|In computing, the Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE, {{sometimes}} pronounced as pixie) specification {{describes a}} standardized client-server environment that <b>boots</b> a software <b>assembly,</b> retrieved from a network, on PXE-enabled clients.

40|$|In August 2009 YAP Films (Toronto) {{received}} {{permission from}} all entities involved {{to create a}} documentary film illustrating {{what it might be}} like to be on the surface of Mars in a space suit during a dust storm or in a dust devil. The science consultants on this project utilized this opportunity to collect data which could be helpful to assess the durability of current space suit construction to the Martian environment. The NDX- 1 prototype planetary space suit developed at the University of North Dakota was used in this study. The suit features a hard upper torso garment, and a soft lower torso and <b>boots</b> <b>assembly.</b> On top of that, a nylon-cotton outer layer is used to protect the suit from dust. Unmanned tests were carried out in the Martian Surface Wind Tunnel (MARSWIT) at the NASA Ames Research Center, with the suit pressurized to 10 kPa gauge. These tests blasted the space suit upper torso and helmet, and a collection of nine candidate outer layer fabrics, with wind-borne simulant for five different 10 min tests under both terrestrial and Martian surface pressures. The infiltration of the dust through the outer fabric of the space suit was photographically documented. The nine fabric samples were analyzed under light and electron microscopes for abrasion damage. Manned tests were carried out at Showbiz Studios (Van Nuys, California) with the pressure maintained at 20 2 kPa gauge. A large fan-created vortex lifted Martian dust simulant (Fullers Earth or JSC Mars- 1) off of the floor, and one of the authors (Lee) wearing the NDX- 1 space suit walked through it to judge both subjectively and objectively how the suit performed under these conditions. Both the procedures to scale the tests to Martian conditions and the results of the infiltration and abrasion studies will be discussed...|$|R
