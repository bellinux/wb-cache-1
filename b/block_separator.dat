50|$|Entering {{from the}} right {{are a series of}} left-moving {{structures}} of the type shown above, separated by varying amounts of horizontal space. Large numbers of these structures are combined with different spacings to represent 0s and 1s in the cyclic tag system's production rules. Because the tag system's production rules are known at the time of creation of the program, and infinitely repeating, the patterns of 0s and 1s at the initial condition can be represented by an infinitely repeating string. Each production rule is separated from the next by another structure known as a rule separator (or <b>block</b> <b>separator),</b> which moves towards the left {{at the same rate as}} the encoding of the production rules.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{document}} understanding {{system in which}} the arrangement of lines of text and <b>block</b> <b>separators</b> within a document are modeled by stochastic context free gram-mars. A grammar corresponds to a document genre; our system may be adapted to a new genre simply by replac-ing the input grammar. The system incorporates an opti-cal character recognition system that outputs characters, their positions and font sizes. These features are combined to form a document representation of lines of text and sepa-rators. Lines of text are labeled as tokens using regular ex-pression matching. The maximum likelihood parse of this stream of tokens and separators yields a functional label-ing of the document lines. We describe business card and business letter applications. 1...|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of June 10, 1903, the {{original}} Seelberg-Cannstatt plant suffered a great fire. All the machinery and 93 finished Mercedes cars, {{a quarter of the}} annual production, were destroyed, together with a small museum with historical items like Daimler-Maybachs first ever motorcycle, the Reitwagen. The displaced workers received haven-salaries and additional bread rations. Neighboring businesses lent workshops, allowing production to continue. DMG created a Relief Fund (one of the first worker insurance schemes) and began building <b>separator</b> <b>blocks</b> in all its plants.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a table detection algorithm using optimization method. We define the table detection problem within the whole page segmentation framework. To reach a good table detection result, we emphasize {{to optimize the}} probabilities of the table region, its neighboring text <b>block</b> and their <b>separator.</b> An iterative updating method is used to optimize the whole page segmentation probability. The training and testing data set for the algorithm include 	 document pages having	 in table entities {{and a total of}} cell entities. Compared with our previous work [12], it raised the accuracy rate to 	 461 - 3 from 9 - 361 and to 13 - 36 from 67 - 36. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{flue gas}} turbine {{discussed}} in this article have relatively backward pneumatic design, low operating efficiency, as well as problems of vibration, catalyst accumulation and fouling etc. It cannot realize better generating power effect because of short running cycle, high failure rate, and low recovery of heat and pressure energy generated of high temperature flue gas. To solve the above problems, this article proposes failure analysis. Flue gas turbine problems appear for the main reasons: the steam of the regeneration standpipe reach the regenerator, lead to catalyst breaking and give rise to a large number of catalyst fines, which causes the third cyclone <b>separator</b> <b>blocked</b> and the flue gas turbine fouled. Then, repair the leakage point of regeneration standpipe, maintain smooth operation,and transform leaf type of flue gas turbine. The flue gas turbine restored power generation status after overhaul. achieve the purpose of high efficiency and long-term stable operation...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} LORASC, a robust algebraic preconditioner for solving sparse linear systems of equations involving symmetric and positive definite matrices. The graph of the input matrix is partitioned by using k-way partitioning with vertex separators into N disjoint domains and a separator {{formed by the}} vertices connecting the N domains. The obtained permuted matrix has a block arrow structure. The preconditioner relies on the Cholesky factorization of the first N diagonal blocks and on approximating the Schur complement corresponding to the <b>separator</b> <b>block.</b> The approximation of the Schur complement involves the factorization of the last diagonal block and a low rank correction obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem or a randomized algorithm. The preconditioner can be build and applied in parallel. Numerical results {{on a set of}} matrices arising from the discretization by the finite element method of linear elasticity models illustrate the robusteness and the efficiency of our preconditioner...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of {{electric}} vehicle (EV) market, the mechanical safety of lithium-ion batteries has become a critical concern for car and battery manufacturers as well as the public. Lithium-ion battery cells consist of cathode, anode, separator and shell casing or aluminum plastic cover. Among them, the shell casing provides substantial strength and fracture resistance under mechanical loading, and the failure of the separator determines onset of internal short circuit of the cell. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, a plasticity and fracture model of the battery shell casing by taking the anisotropic plasticity and stress-state dependent fracture into account was developed. The shell casing model is calibrated and validated at both specimen and component levels. This shell casing model, together with homogenized jellyroll model could predict mechanical behavior of single cylindrical 18650 cell well and could serve for battery pack crash simulation purposes. Another part of this thesis is mechanical test, characterization and modeling of battery separators since the mechanical properties of separators are crucial to internal shorts of lithium-ion batteries. Mechanical properties of commercially available four typical separators that including polypropylene (PP), trilayer (PP-PE-PP), ceramic-coated and nonwoven separators were compared, such as in-plane tensile strength, out-of-plane compression strength and puncture strength. Two distinct failure modes of dry-processed separators under biaxial loading were observed in the tests and used to explain the differences in short circuit characteristics of same cells. A conservative defection-based failure criterion for predicting of onset of short from experimental data was proposed. Numerical model of separator was developed and it succeeded in predicting the response of PP separator under biaxial loading. Owing to the micro porous semi-crystalline nature of widely used PP separator, interrupted tests of PP separator under different in-plane tension including machine direction, transverse direction and diagonal direction were conducted in order to reveal deformation mechanism at the micrometer level. Through scanning electric microscopy (SEM) observation and X-ray diffraction of deformed regions from interrupted test specimens, deformation sequences of micro fibrils and lamellae <b>blocks</b> of PP <b>separator</b> are reported. Lastly, significant mechanical degradation of separator due to charge-discharge cycling was described. by Xiaowei Zhang. Thesis: Ph.
