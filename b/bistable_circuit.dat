5000|$|An {{electronic}} flip-flop, or [...] "latch", or [...] "bistable multivibrator", is {{a circuit}} {{that due to}} high positive feedback is not stable in a balanced or intermediate state. Such a <b>bistable</b> <b>circuit</b> {{is the basis of}} one bit of electronic memory. The flip-flop uses a pair of amplifiers, transistors, or logic gates connected to each other so that positive feedback maintains the state of the circuit in one of two unbalanced stable states after the input signal has been removed, until a suitable alternative signal is applied to change the state. Computer random access memory (RAM) can be made in this way, with one latching circuit for each bit of memory.|$|E
5000|$|Like every latch, the {{fundamental}} collector-base coupled <b>bistable</b> <b>circuit</b> possesses a hysteresis. So, {{it can be}} converted to a Schmitt trigger by connecting an additional base resistor R to one of the inputs (Q1 base in the figure). The two resistors R and R4 form a parallel voltage summer (the circle in the ballock diagram above) that sums output (Q2 collector) voltage and the input voltage, and drives the single-ended transistor [...] "comparator" [...] Q1. When the base voltage crosses the threshold (VBE0 ∞ 0.65 V) in some direction, a part of Q2's collector voltage is added in the same direction to the input voltage. Thus the output modifies the input voltage by means of parallel positive feedback and does not affect the threshold (the base-emitter voltage).|$|E

More complicated designs that use clock signals and that change only on a rising or falling edge of the clock are called edge-triggered [...] "flip-flops". Formally, a flip-flop is called a <b>bistable</b> <b>circuit,</b> because it has two stable states which it can maintain indefinitely. The combination of multiple flip-flops in parallel, to store a multiple-bit value, is known as a register. When using any of these gate setups the overall system has memory; it is then called a sequential logic system since its output can be influenced by its previous state(s), i.e. by the sequence of input states. In contrast, the output from combinational logic is purely a combination of its present inputs, unaffected by the previous input and output states.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research presented in this thesis {{was to investigate the}} effects of wearout processes on the performance and reliability of CMOS <b>bistable</b> <b>circuits.</b> The main wearout process affecting reliability of submicron MOS devices was identified as hot-carrier stress (and the resulting degradation in circuit performance). The effect of hot-carrier degradation on the resolving time leading to metastability of the <b>bistable</b> <b>circuits</b> also have been investigated. Hot-carrier degradation was identified as a major reliability concern for CMOS <b>bistable</b> <b>circuits</b> designed using submicron technologies. The major hot-carrier effects are the impact ionisation of hot- carriers in the channel of a MOS device and the resulting substrate current and gate current generation. The substrate current has been used as the monitor for the hot-carrier stress and have developed a substrate current model based on existing models that have been extended to incorporate additional effects for submicron devices. The optimisation of the substrate current model {{led to the development of}} degradation and life-time models. These are presented in the thesis. A number of <b>bistable</b> <b>circuits</b> designed using 0. 7 micron CMOS technology design rules were selected for the substrate current model analysis. The circuits were simulated using a set of optimised SPICE model parameters and the stress factors on each device was evaluated using the substrate current model implemented as a post processor to the SPICE simulation. Model parameters for each device in the bistable were degraded according to the stress experienced and simulated again to determine the degradation in characteristic timing parameters for a predetermined stress period. A comparative study of the effect of degradation on characteristic timing parameters for a number of latch circuits was carried out. The life-times of the bistables were determined using the life-time model. The <b>bistable</b> <b>circuits</b> were found to enter a metastable state under critical timing conditions. The effect of hot-carrier stress induced degradation on the metastable state operation of the bistables were analysed. Based on the analysis of the hot-carrier degradation effects on the latch circuits, techniques are suggested to reduce hot-carrier stress and to improve circuit life-time. Modifications for improving hot- carrier reliability were incorporated into all the <b>bistable</b> <b>circuits</b> which were re-simulated to determine the improvement in life-time and reliability of the circuits under hot-carrier stress. The improved circuits were degraded based on the new stress factors and the degradation effects on the critical timing parameters evaluated and these were compared with those before the modifications. The improvements in the life-time and the reliability of the selected <b>bistable</b> <b>circuits</b> were quantified. It has been demonstrated that the hot-carrier reliability for all the selected <b>bistable</b> <b>circuits</b> can be improved by design techniques to reduce the stress on identified critically stressed devices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{demonstrate}} a new high-entropy digital element suitable for True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) embedded in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The original idea behind this principle {{lies in the}} randomness extraction on oscillatory trajectory when a <b>bistable</b> <b>circuit</b> is resolving a metastable event.

We propose a new bi-stable structure – Transition Effect Ring Oscillator (TERO) where oscillatory phase can be forced on demand and be reliably synthesized in FPGA. Randomness is represented as a variance of the TERO oscillations number counted after each excitation. Variance is highly dependent on the internal noise of logic cells and can be used easily for reliable instant inner testing of each generated bit. Our proposed mathematical model, simulations and hardware experiments show that TERO is significantly more sensitive to intrinsic noise in FPGA logic cells and less sensitive to global perturbations than a ring oscillator composed from the same elements.

40|$|Complex gene {{regulatory}} circuits contain many {{features that}} are likely to contribute to their operation. It is unclear, however, whether all these features are necessary for proper circuit behavior or whether certain ones are refinements that make the circuit work better but are dispensable for qualitatively normal behavior. We have addressed this question using the phage λ regulatory circuit, which can persist in two stable states, the lytic state and the lysogenic state. In the lysogenic state, the CI repressor positively regulates its own expression by stimulating transcription from the PRM promoter. We tested whether this feature {{is an essential part of}} the regulatory circuitry. Several phages with a cI mutation preventing positive autoregulation and an up mutation in the PRM promoter showed near-normal behavior. We conclude that positive autoregulation is not necessary for proper operation of the λ circuitry and speculate that it serves a partially redundant function of stabilizing a <b>bistable</b> <b>circuit,</b> a form of redundancy we term “circuit-level redundancy. ” We discuss our findings in the context of a two-stage model for evolution and elaboration of regulatory circuits from simpler to more complex forms...|$|E
40|$|Biomolecular {{circuits}} {{with two}} distinct and stable steady {{states have been}} identified as essential components {{in a wide range of}} biological networks, with a variety of mechanisms and topologies giving rise to their important bistable property. Understanding the differences between circuit implementations is an important question, particularly for the synthetic biologist faced with determining which <b>bistable</b> <b>circuit</b> design out of many is best for their specific application. In this work we explore the applicability of Sturm's theorem—a tool from nineteenth-century real algebraic geometry—to comparing ‘functionally equivalent’ bistable circuits without the need for numerical simulation. We first consider two genetic toggle variants and two different positive feedback circuits, and show how specific topological properties present in each type of circuit can serve to increase the size of the regions of parameter space in which they function as switches. We then demonstrate that a single competitive monomeric activator added to a purely monomeric (and otherwise monostable) mutual repressor circuit is sufficient for bistability. Finally, we compare our approach with the Routh–Hurwitz method and derive consistent, yet more powerful, parametric conditions. The predictive power and ease of use of Sturm's theorem demonstrated in this work suggest that algebraic geometric techniques may be underused in biomolecular circuit analysis...|$|E

40|$|Bistable gene {{regulatory}} circuits can adopt {{more than}} one stable epigenetic state. To understand how natural circuits have this and other systems properties, several groups have designed regulatory circuits de novo. Here we describe an alternative approach. We have modified an existing <b>bistable</b> <b>circuit,</b> that of phage λ. With this approach, we used powerful genetic selections to identify functional circuits and selected for variants with altered behavior. The λ circuit involves two antagonistic repressors, CI and Cro. We replaced λ Cro with a module that included Lac repressor and several lac operators. Using a combinatorial approach, we isolated variants with different types of regulatory behavior. Several resembled wild-type λ—they could grow lytically, could form highly stable lysogens, and carried out prophage induction. Another variant could form stable lysogens {{in the presence of}} a ligand for Lac repressor but switched to the lytic state when the ligand was removed. Several isolates evolved toward a desired behavior under selective pressure. These results strongly support the idea that complex circuits can arise during the course of evolution by a combination of simpler regulatory modules. They also underscore the advantages of modifying a natural circuit as an approach to understanding circuit design, systems behavior, and circuit evolution...|$|E
40|$|Activation of cyclin B 1 -cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk 1), {{triggered}} by a positive feedback loop {{at the end of}} G 2, is the key event that initiates mitotic entry. In metaphase, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome-dependent destruction of cyclin B 1 inactivates Cdk 1 again, allowing mitotic exit and cell division. Several models describe Cdk 1 activation kinetics in mitosis, but experimental data on how the activation proceeds in mitotic cells have largely been lacking. We use a novel approach to determine the temporal development of cyclin B 1 -Cdk 1 activity in single cells. By quantifying both dephosphorylation of Cdk 1 and phosphorylation of the Cdk 1 target anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome 3, we disclose how cyclin B 1 -Cdk 1 continues to be activated after centrosome separation. Importantly, we discovered that cytoplasmic cyclin B 1 -Cdk 1 activity can be maintained even when cyclin B 1 translocates to the nucleus in prophase. These experimental data are fitted into a model describing cyclin B 1 -Cdk 1 activation in human cells, revealing a striking resemblance to a <b>bistable</b> <b>circuit.</b> In line with the observed kinetics, cyclin B 1 -Cdk 1 levels required to enter mitosis are lower than the amount of cyclin B 1 -Cdk 1 needed for mitotic progression.

We propose new TERO structure with simplified control adopted for the Actel Fusion FP-GAs. An original {{idea behind the}} principle lies in the randomness extraction on an oscillatory trajectory when a <b>bistable</b> <b>circuit</b> is resolving previous metastable event. Although oscillatory behavior is a well-known issue {{in the field of}} synchronization flip-flops, this feature was not yet been used for the TRNG designs. We are able to excite the oscillatory metastability in the TERO reliably. The number of executed oscillations varies after each excitation. The randomness is represented as a least significant bit of the number of oscillations accordingly. The number of generated oscillations {{is directly related to the}} intrinsic noise of the TERO components. There are three potential random processes that can affect resulting number of oscillations: 1) The actual noise and circuit parameters when excitation pulse forces entering to the oscillatory metastability phase; 2) The jitter accumulation during the oscillatory metastability phase; and 3) The ability of the last pulse to add one more oscillation can also depend on the actual noise conditions. We analyze all three phases that can possibly bring random contribution to final number of oscillations. We enhance an original mathematical model accordingly in terms of the intrinsic noise composition. We attach experimental results from both Actel and Xilinx FPGAs in order to show TERO-based TRNG suitability for the practical use. I...|$|E

It is sometimes used to eliminate noise from a digital signal. Under some circumstances, positive feedback may cause a device to latch, i.e., to reach a condition in which the output is locked to its maximum or minimum state.

40|$|Summary:We present CellLine, a {{simulator}} of {{the dynamics}} of gene regulatory networks (GRN) in the cells of a lineage. From user-defined reactions and initial substance quantities, it generates cell lineages, i. e. genealogic pedigrees of cells related through mitotic division. Each cell’s dynamics is driven by a delayed stochastic simulation algorithm (delayed SSA), allowing multiple time delayed reactions. The cells of the lineage can be individually subject to ‘perturba-tions’, such as gene deletion, duplication and mutation. External interventions, such as adding or removing a substance at a given moment, can be specified. Cell differentiation lineages, where differentiation is stochastically driven or externally induced, can be modeled as well. Finally, CellLine can generate and simulate the dynamics of multiple copies of any given cell of the lineage. As examples of CellLine use, we simulate the following systems: cell lineages containing a model of the P 53 -Mdm 2 feedback loop, a differentiation lineage where each cell contains a 4 gene repressilator (a <b>bistable</b> <b>circuit),</b> a model of the differentiation of the cells of the retinal mosaic required for color vision in Drosophila melanogaster, where the differentiation pathway depends on one substance’s concentration that is controlled by a stochastic process, and a 9 gene GRN to illustrate the advantage of using CellLine rather than simulating multiple independent cells, in cases where the cells of the lineage are dynamically correlated.

30|$|The third type uses {{metastable}} circuits [2, 17 – 22]. This type of TRNG {{is suitable}} for embedded devices because of its small-scale and low-power consumption. The prototypes of these proposed TRNGs were fabricated on CMOS and can generate high-quality random numbers. However, they need an additional dynamic adjustment for the voltage or for the internal elements in the metastable circuit. For example, in [17], a negative feedback loop using a switched capacitor network is used to adjust the DC bias of their proposed <b>bistable</b> <b>circuit.</b> In [19], floating-gate memory is used to adjust the DC bias of the SR latch efficiently. In [18], the bias of the SR latch is controlled by measuring the metastable resolution time. This adjustment needs a dedicated full-custom circuit including analog components, {{which leads to a}} large design cost at the transistor level. Moreover, it is necessary to re-design the circuits when implementing them with different CMOS technology because the TRNGs often do not work as expected under a different CMOS technology. In [20], a structure called transition effect ring oscillator (TERO) was proposed and implemented on an FPGA. TERO retrieves the entropy using the oscillatory metastable operation. A TRNG was implemented by the XOR of two TERO outputs on an FPGA, and the output sequences passed the NIST 800 - 22 tests. TERO structure does not require feedback circuits and is expected to be efficiently fabricated on CMOS. In [22], the stochastic model of TERO was validated by implementation of an 28 -nm CMOS. However, the hardware size and the throughput are not reported.|$|E
40|$|Special issue: Analog Design Issues in Digital VSLI Circuits and Systems; ISBN: 978 - 1 - 4613 - 7795 - 5 Nowadays, {{metastability}} {{is becoming}} a serious problem in high-performance VLSI design, mainly due to the relatively-high probability of error when a <b>bistable</b> <b>circuit</b> operates at high frequencies. As far as we know, there is not any work published that justifies and formally characterizes metastable behavior in dynamic latches. With current technologies, dynamic latches are widely used in high-performance VLSI circuits, mainly due to their lower cost and higher operation speed than static latches. In this work, we demonstrate that dynamic memory cells present an anomalous behavior referred to as metastable operation with characteristics {{similar to those of}} static latches. We perform a suitable generalization of metastability to the dynamic case, applying it to a CMOS dynamic D-latch. A theoretical model will be proposed, allowing the quantification of metastability, and it will be validated through electric simulation with HSPICE. After that, we have compared the metastable behavior of the dynamic latch with its static counterpart, obtaining results about the characteristic parameters of metastability and the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for both kinds of bistable circuits. These results have allowed us to conclude that, unlike metastability windows in static latches, a clearly defined input interval exists which produces an infinite resolution time. Regarding MTBF, the dynamic latch presents a very low MTBF value compared to the static latch. These results show that dynamic latches should not be used in those circuits where the risk of asynchronism between clock and data signals is not negligible.

40|$|Positive {{feedback}} {{is a common}} mechanism in genetic circuits {{and can be used}} to achieve amplification, bistability, and hysteresis. Positive feedback mechanisms have been employed in numerous synthetic biology applications, including {{in the development of a}} modular positive feedback-based gene amplifier by Nistala et al. [1]. The modular design potentially enables use as a component in more complex synthetic gene networks, thus helping to achieve the oft-stated goal of designing well-characterized components that can be used in diverse synthetic biology applications. The positive feedback-based gene amplifier provides amplification of the maximum expression level of a gene product, and increased sensitivity to the inducer. However, the initial analysis by Nistala et al. did not demonstrate that this particular positive feedback mechanism can produce a hysteretic response to an inducer, i. e. exhibit memory of a prior stimulus. Positive feedback in a genetic circuit potentially, but not necessarily, leads to bistability, and a <b>bistable</b> <b>circuit</b> will produce some degree of hysteresis [2]. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to determine under what conditions, if any, the modular positive feedback-based gene amplifier will produce a hysteretic response. A modular gene amplifier with well-characterized hysteretic properties will potentially be a useful asset for synthetic biologists designing more complex networks out of simpler components. A simple mathematical model of gene expression in a positive-feedback system is used predict the conditions for bistability and hysteresis versus a simple graded response. Experiments are performed on the positive feedback-based tetracycline sensor in E. coli using green fluorescent protein (GFP) to measure expression level of the gene product. In the experiments, cells are placed in solutions of various inducer concentrations and grown to a steady-state level of GFP expression. Cells are then resuspended in solutions of lower inducer concentrations and allowed to reach steady state. Hysteresis is observed if the steady-state GFP level depends on the prior induction level of the cell culture. This research shows that the modular positive feedback-based gene amplifier is capable of producing a hysteretic response to a stimulus. The magnitude of the hysteretic response depended on the dilution ratio used to inoculate the cultures. Additionally, the magnitude of the hysteretic response depended partially on the final induction level of the culture, as higher induction levels resulted in a larger proportion of cells exhibiting a high level of GFP fluorescence. The cultures with induction history exhibited bistable GFP expression at all inducer concentrations. Cells exhibiting low GFP fluorescence grew at a faster rate than cells exhibiting high GFP fluorescence. This suggests that low dilution ratios provide more time for cells expressing at a low level to grow before the culture is saturated, and therefore make up a larger proportion of the final culture producing a smaller hysteretic response. These results provide a deeper understanding of the properties of the modular positive feedback-based gene amplifier and the conditions for hysteresis...|$|E
