50|$|Changing gear {{with the}} Wilson box {{relied on the}} control of the <b>brake</b> <b>bands</b> that held each epicyclic's annulus in fixed position. The <b>brake</b> <b>band</b> to be {{selected}} was controlled by a rotating cam, moved by the gear shift lever. Only one band was engaged for each gear selection. This small lever could not provide enough power to engage and lock the <b>brake</b> <b>band,</b> thus the need for the pedal The actual movement of the <b>brake</b> <b>bands</b> was controlled by the 'toggle' mechanism, a distinctive feature of the Wilson design. When the pedal was pressed and released, a series or 'busbar' of finger-like levers were pressed upwards by a strong coil spring, against a series of light linkages or 'operating struts'. The position of each linkage was controlled by the gear selection camshaft. If the cam (for each gear) held the linkage in place, rather than allowing it to swing out of the way, the busbar finger would then press, via the operating strut, onto the toggles controlling the <b>brake</b> <b>bands</b> themselves. These toggles provided the additional leverage necessary to hold the <b>brake</b> <b>band</b> in place, under the force of the coil spring, until the pedal was next pressed. A further characteristic of the Wilson design was the use of self-adjusting nuts on each band, to compensate for wear. The action of engaging and disengaging each band was sufficient to advance the ratchet nuts and so adjust for wear by taking up any slack.|$|R
25|$|A <b>band</b> <b>brake</b> {{consists}} of a band, strap, or cable that wraps around a drum that rotates with a wheel and is pulled tight to generate <b>braking</b> friction. <b>Band</b> <b>brakes</b> appeared as early as 1884 on tricycles. Star Cycles introduced a <b>band</b> <b>brake</b> in 1902 on its bicycles with freewheels. <b>Band</b> <b>brakes</b> are still manufactured for bicycles today.|$|R

50|$|<b>Band</b> <b>brakes</b> can be simple, compact, rugged, and can {{generate}} high force {{with a light}} input force. However, <b>band</b> <b>brakes</b> are prone to grabbing or chatter and loss of brake force when hot. These problems are inherent with the design and thus limit where <b>band</b> <b>brakes</b> are a good solution.|$|R
50|$|This {{was invented}} and {{developed}} by Edgar de Normanville and fitted to 1930s Humber Limited cars. It was broadly {{similar to the}} Wilson, but used direct hydraulic actuation of the <b>brake</b> <b>bands,</b> under control of a steering column lever, and so avoided {{the need for a}} change-gear pedal and the toggle mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The {{drivetrain}} did not {{deviate from}} those of the Sport. So she was a primary drive with gears, a wet multi-plate clutch, a three-speed gearbox and a chain to the rear wheel. That chain was particularly long, and was led therefore a support gear with a tensioning device. The rear brake was a <b>brake</b> <b>band,</b> which was operated by a pedal.|$|R
50|$|Chain brakes prevent {{movement}} of the saw's cutting chain by applying a steel <b>brake</b> <b>band</b> around the driven clutch drum. Clamping force for the <b>brake</b> <b>band</b> is provided by a powerful spring. The chain brake has two purposes. First, {{it can be used}} to secure the chain when changing position, moving between cuts or starting a cold saw, which requires a partly open throttle. This would otherwise lead to uncontrolled chain movement, a major hazard in older saws. Secondly, the chainbrake can activate under kickback conditions to prevent the operator from being struck by a running chain. Being struck by even a static chain may cause serious injury, but anything that can be done to mitigate the usually dreadful injuries caused by contact with a moving chain is of considerable benefit to operators. Kickback injuries usually occur to the head, face, neck and shoulders; when a running chain is involved, such injuries are usually very serious, often disfiguring and sometimes fatal.|$|R

50|$|Manual {{transmissions}} {{are characterized}} by gear ratios that are selectable by locking selected gear pairs to the output shaft inside the transmission. Conversely, most automatic transmissions feature epicyclic (planetary) gearing controlled by <b>brake</b> <b>bands</b> and/or clutch packs to select gear ratio. Automatic transmissions that allow the driver to manually select the current gear are called manumatics. A manual-style transmission operated by computer is often called an automated transmission rather than an automatic, even though no {{distinction between the two}} terms need be made.|$|R

It consisted of the motor, auxiliary motor, drive and steering gear, power transmission and radiator. The auxiliary engine was a four cylinder diesel engine and was used to drive the main generator and the power supply. In case of {{a problem with the}} main motor, the tank could be driven with the auxiliary engine via the auxiliary transmission, over short distances. The transmission was an SLM with 6 forward and 2 reverse gears. The foot brake and parking brake consisted of two <b>brake</b> <b>bands</b> on the left and right sides of the gearbox.

50|$|After {{releasing}} the electro-quirk album Peakahokahoo and alt-country album Hold Yer Horses, Piney married the two styles {{together to create}} folktronic fusion album The Yearling, which combines the twang and heartbreak of country music with eclectic beats, lo-fi synths and found sounds. Album track and single, Of All The Wonderful Things, features Eamon Hamilton from <b>Brakes</b> (<b>band)</b> and British Sea Power. Album track Miss Havisham features in the film You're Not You starring Hilary Swank. The album secured radio sessions with Mark Radcliffe, Marc Riley and Cerys Mathews on BBC Radio 6 Music.

50|$|Synthetic ATF is {{available}} in aftermarket brands, offering better performance and service life for certain applications (such as frequent trailer towing).The use of a lint-free white rag to wipe the dipstick on automatic transmissions is advised so that {{the color of the}} fluid can be checked. Dark brown or black ATF can be an indicator of a transmission problem, vehicle abuse, or fluid that has far exceeded its useful life. Over-used ATF often has reduced lubrication properties and abrasive friction materials (from clutches and <b>brake</b> <b>bands)</b> suspended in it; failure to replace such fluid will accelerate transmission wear and could eventually ruin an otherwise healthy transmission. However color alone is not a completely reliable indication of the service life of ATF as most ATF products will darken with use. The manufacturer's recommended service interval is a more reliable measure of ATF life. In the absence of service or repair records, fluid color is a common means of gauging ATF service life.|$|R

25|$|A rim <b>band</b> <b>brake,</b> as {{implemented}} on the Yankee bicycle by Royce Husted in the 1990s, {{consists of}} a stainless-steel cable, wrapped in a kevlar sheath, that rides in a u-shaped channel {{on the side of}} the wheel rim. Squeezing the brake lever tightens the cable against the channel to produce braking friction. A return spring slackens the cable when the brake lever is released, no adjustment is required, and the brake becomes more forceful when wet. Husted said his inspiration was the <b>band</b> <b>brake</b> used on industrial machinery. The Yankee bicycle only included a rear brake, but that met U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission standards.|$|R

50|$|Shutting off {{the engine}} caused the {{transmission}} oil pressure to rapidly dissipate. If the selector lever was in reverse or moved to reverse after the engine stopped, two mechanical parts combined to provide a parking brake. The reverse unit ring gear was held stationary by the reverse anchor. The drive shaft could still turn causing the reverse unit sun gear and attached rear unit ring gear to rotate {{at a very high}} speed, {{were it not for the}} fact that the rear unit ring gear band was now applied by a heavy spring. Usually, bands are applied by a servo and released by spring pressure, but in this case, the band was held off by the servo and applied by spring pressure (actually, when the engine was running, the band was applied by a combination of spring pressure assisted by oil pressure). With the engine off, this <b>brake</b> <b>band</b> acting on the rear unit ring gear had a tremendous mechanical advantage. Since the rear unit ring gear with its attached reverse unit sun gear and the reverse unit ring gear were both locked to the transmission case, the planet carriers and driveshaft could not turn. As such, it provided an effective driveshaft mounted parking brake to be used alone or supplementing the hand brake.|$|R
50|$|The {{governor}} {{is connected to}} the output shaft and regulates the hydraulic pressure depending on the vehicle speed. The engine load is monitored either by a throttle cable or a vacuum modulator. The valve body is the hydraulic control center that receives pressurized fluid from the main pump operated by the fluid coupling/torque converter. The pressure coming from this pump is regulated and used to run a network of spring-loaded valves, check balls and servo pistons. The valves use the pump pressure and the pressure from a centrifugal governor on the output side (as well as hydraulic signals from the range selector valves and the throttle valve or modulator) to control which ratio is selected on the gearset; as the vehicle and engine change speed, the difference between the pressures changes, causing different sets of valves to open and close. The hydraulic pressure controlled by these valves drives the various clutch and <b>brake</b> <b>band</b> actuators, thereby controlling the operation of the planetary gearset to select the optimum gear ratio for the current operating conditions. However, in many modern automatic transmissions, the valves are controlled by electro-mechanical servos which are controlled by the electronic engine control unit (ECU) or a separate transmission control unit (TCU, also known as transmission control module (TCM).|$|R
