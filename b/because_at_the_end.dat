5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E

Eventually, Joe talked me out of that decision <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the day, I don't want to sabotage Joe or Marvel, and I {{have a lot of respect}} for both of those." [...] Quesada explained this disagreement with Straczynski, stating that their rift was primarily over the [...] "methodology" [...] of how to erase Peter and Mary Jane's marriage, but Straczynski was on board with the editorial mandate of undoing the Parkers' marriage.|$|E

I chose to debut this work in progress, this rough rehearsal, here in Australia because I feel so bad about cancelling on you guys the last time. I'm sorry. You've been so patient, you waited for so long, I feel like I owe you a present, so this is your present... I want to make a disclaimer...

Two different reviews by staff members of Sputnikmusic praised the song. On the first review, Dave de Sylvia said the song was not radio-friendly, but added that [...] "it is beautifully arranged, taking in bouncy Sting-like synthesised strings and an excellent vocal performance." [...] On the second review, Channing Freeman wrote that [...] "Sober" [...] is [...] "one of the few tracks [...] where Clarkson gets away with her vocal restraint, mainly <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> she lets loose and gives one of the best performances of her career, making the two or so minutes of waiting worthwhile."

500|$|The {{success of}} Just Dance {{led to the}} {{development}} of a sequel, Just Dance 2, which focused on adding new features and refinements to the game—such as improvements to its motion tracking system, new game modes, and support for downloadable content. Sales of Just Dance 2 surpassed that of the original; with over 5 million copies as of January 2011, it was the best-selling third-party title for the Wii. Laurent Detoc, CEO of Ubisoft's North American operations, stated that this achievement [...] " [...] the Just Dance brand as a pop culture phenomenon." [...] Poix felt that [...] "there's a pressure within Ubisoft to keep Just Dance enormous, and we think we can make it enormous. But it wasn't like that initially, <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the first one, people—even us—had our doubts that it would last.

500|$|Both Bevin and McConnell were {{critical}} of a February 2014 ruling by U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II that held that {{an amendment to}} the Kentucky Constitution banning same-sex marriage violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Bevin pointed out that Heyburn once worked for McConnell, who supported his nomination to the bench by President George H. W. Bush. Later in the month, Bevin told The Janet Mefford Show, [...] "If it's all right to have same-sex marriages, why not define a marriage– <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the day, a lot of this ends up being taxes and who can visit who in the hospital and there's other repercussions and things that come with it– so a person may want to define themselves as being married to one of their children so that they can then in fact pass on certain things to that child financially and otherwise." [...] Critics charged that Bevin was suggesting that the legalization of same-sex marriage could lead to the acceptance of incestuous relationships; a Bevin spokesperson responded, [...] " [...] sees no comparison between gay marriage and incest. He was discussing the implications of the legal rights related to this issue such as hospital visitations and benefits. To imply otherwise is ridiculous." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Nicholas Meyer {{was brought}} in to direct the sixth film in the series: [...] Roddenberry and he clashed creatively, as Roddenberry felt that having the Enterprise crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer {{described}} a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying:His guys were lined up {{on one side of the}} room, and my guys were lined up on the other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically, I came out of it feeling not very good, and I've not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the day, I was going to go out and make the movie. I didn't have to take him on. Not my finest hour. In Joel Engel's biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a [...] "good job".

500|$|After a few European dates, {{returning}} bassist Tracey Lamb replaced Carrera {{before a}} new {{tour in the}} United States. But more line-up changes were in store for the band <b>because,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of 1992, Cris Bonacci left the band to become a touring musician and then a producer. In 1993, her place as lead guitarist was taken back by Kelly Johnson, who returned after nine years to England from LA, where she had played in a band with Kathy Valentine and written and produced her own music. The plethora of compilations of old Girlschool material that had started {{to be released from}} 1989 kept the band alive on the CD market and guaranteed enough visibility to get a good number of gigs every year in every part of the world, often supporting other NWOBHM acts like Motörhead or Saxon. In this period, the girls were also present at rock festivals all over Europe, both as Girlschool or separately in other outfits. In 1995, Communiqué Records released Girlschool Live, a live album documenting the intense live shows of the band in that period and which included the new tracks [...] "Knife" [...] and [...] "Little Green Men". Girlschool continued their live activity in the 1990s, culminating with a participation to the Wacken Open Air festival on Friday, 6 August 1999.|$|E

50|$|Dailies, in filmmaking, are the raw, {{unedited}} footage shot {{during the}} making of a motion picture.

Alba Iulia is a city located on the Mureş River in Alba County, and since the High Middle Ages, the city has been the seat of Transylvania's Roman Catholic diocese. Between 1541 and 1690 it was the capital of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom and the latter Principality of Transylvania.

2500|$|Mass {{is used in}} the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, the Lutheran Churches (especially in the Church of Sweden, the Church of Norway, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland), by some Anglicans (especially {{those of}} an Anglo-Catholic churchmanship), and in some other forms of Western Christianity. [...] At least in the Catholic Church, the Mass is a longer rite which always {{consists}} of two main parts: the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist, in that order. The Liturgy of the Word consists mainly of readings from scripture (the Bible) and a homily preached by a priest or deacon and is essentially distinct and separate from the sacrament of the Eucharist, which comprises the entirety of the Liturgy of the Eucharist, so the Eucharist itself is only about one half of the Mass. [...] (It is also possible and permissible in the Latin Rite for a priest to consecrate and distribute the Eucharist outside the ritual structure of the Masssuch an event is often called a communion servicebut it is much more common to celebrate a full Mass.) [...] Among the many other terms used in the Catholic Church are [...] "Holy Mass", [...] "the Memorial of the Passion, Death and Resurrection of the Lord", the [...] "Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", and the [...] "Holy Mysteries". The term mass derives from post-classical Latin missa [...] "dismissal", found in the concluding phrase of the liturgy, [...] "Ite, missa est". [...] The term missa has come to imply a 'mission', <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the Mass the congregation are sent out to serve Christ.|$|E

But the writer was unwilling to accede to this suggestion, not only <b>because</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of August he shrank from a laborious effort, but principally because he did not hold that his position in the House of Commons warranted on his part such an interference, since, after all, he was only the comrade in arms of one who chose to be only an independent member of the House. He therefore unaffectedly stated that he thought the office was somewhat above his measure. But Lord George Bentinck would not listen to these representations. 'I don't pretend to know much,' he said, 'but I can judge of men and horses.' It is difficult to refuse those who are themselves setting a constant example of self-sacrifice, and therefore, so far as the labour was concerned, the writer would not have shrunk from the exertion even on the last day of the month of August, and when the particular wish of Lord George was found to be more general than the writer presumed to suppose, he accordingly endeavoured to accomplish the intention.|$|E
