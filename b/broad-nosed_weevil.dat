5000|$|Arostropsis {{is known}} {{only from a}} single fossil, the holotype, {{specimen}} number [...] "C 7968, GPIH 4516", which is housed in the fossil collection of the Geology and Palaeontology Institute and Museum, part of the University of Hamburg. The specimen is composed of a fully complete adult male <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>weevil</b> which has been preserved as an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Baltic amber. [...] Baltic amber dates to between forty and forty-five million years old and the holotype specimen {{was found in the}} Prussian Formation. The Arostropsis holotype was recovered from an amber quarry in Jantarny near the city of Kaliningrad along the Baltic Sea coast in Russia. [...] The fossil was first studied by paleoentomologists Nikolai N. Yunakov and Alexander G. Kirejtshuk, both of the Russian Academy of Sciences. [...] Yunakov and Kirejtshuk's 2011 type description of the new genus and species was published in the online journal ZooKeys. [...] The genus name Arostropsis was coined by Yunakov and Kirejtshuk as a combination of two Greek words rōstron meaning [...] "beak or snout" [...] and opsis which means [...] "resembling (something)" [...] in combination with the negative prefix a. The specific epithet groehni was coined in honor of Carsten Gröhn who first collected the holotype specimen. [...] Arostropsis is {{one of a number of}} broad-nosed weevils described from specimens in Baltic amber. As of the 2011 Yunakov and Kirejtshuk paper, at least eleven species had been described or suggested by paleoentomologists.|$|E

40|$|Austromonticola gen. n. is {{proposed}} {{for a group}} of eight New Zealand alpine <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>weevil</b> species, all of which are here described: A. atriarius sp. n. (type locality: Umbrella Mountains, Central Otago), A. caelibatus sp. n. (type locality: Ohau Range, Mackenzie), A. furcatus sp. n. (type locality: Old Man Range, Central Otago), A. inflatus sp. n. (type locality: Hawkdun Range, Central Otago), A. planulatus sp. n. (type locality: St Marys Range, Central Otago), A. postinventus sp. n. (type locality: Kirkliston Range, South Canterbury), A. mataura sp. n. (type locality: Mt Dick, Otago Lakes) and A. rotundus sp. n. (type locality: Old Man Range, Central Otago). All species occur exclusively above 1000 m elevation in the mountains of Central Otago and South Canterbury in the South Island. A phylogeny of the genus, including six outgroups, was inferred from 33 morphological characters. It resolved the genus as monophyletic, and revealed two strongly supported clades within Austromonticola. DNA sequences of four gene regions were obtained from five species. Of these, the 3 ' end of COI proved to be the most suitable for the identification of specimens. Females of all species have diagnostic secondary sexual structures on the elytra and ventrites. These structures are hypothesised to have evolved to assist with oviposition in and beside cushion plants or by selection for structures to mitigate the costs to females of prolonged mating...|$|E

The genus is endemic to the Atlantic {{forests of the}} states of Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, Brazil and is mainly characterized {{by the presence of}} humped elytra bearing large conical tubercles on the intervals 5, or 3 and 5, or 3, 5 and 7.

40|$|Using {{syntactic}} and semantic {{conventions of}} the taxonomic concept approach (Franz et al. 2015), we describe three newly recognized fossil broad-nosed weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Entiminae) preserved in Early Miocene amber (ca. 20. 4 - 16. 0 mya) from the Dominican Republic: Scelianoma compacta sp. n. sec. Franz & Zhang (2017) (henceforth abbreviated as [FZ 2017]), Tropirhinus palpebratus sp. n. [FZ 2017], and Diaprepes anticus sp. n. [FZ 2017]. The taxonomic assignment of the amber inclusions is grounded in a preceding phylogenetic analysis by Franz (2012). As many as 88 of the 143 therein identified characters were coded for the fossils, whose traits are largely congruent with those present in extant congeners while also differing in ways that justify their new nomenclatural and taxonomic status. We present detailed images, descriptions, and phylogenetically informed diagnoses for the three new species-level entities, along with logically consistent Region Connection Calculus (RCC- 5) alignments of the amended genus-level classifications for Scelianoma Franz and Girón 2009 [FZ 2017], Tropirhinus Schoenherr 1823 [FZ 2017], and Diaprepes Schoenherr 1823 [FZ 2017] - in relation to 2 - 4 preceding classifications published in 1982 - 2012. The description of Scelianoma compacta [FZ 2017] from Hispaniola is indicative of a more widespread historical range of Scelianoma [FZ 2017] than reflected in the extant, southwestern Puerto Rican Scelianoma elydimorpha Franz and Girón 2009 sec. Franz and Girón (2009). The presence of Diaprepes anticus [FZ 2017] in Hispaniola during the Early Miocene suggests an eastward directed process of island colonization and likely speciation of members of Diaprepes [FZ 2017], given that most extant relatives occur throughout the Lesser Antilles. The herein presented data will facilitate more reliable reconstructions of historical biographic processes thought to have played {{a prominent role in}} the diversification of the West Indian and Neotropical mainland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>weevil</b> lineages...|$|E

Accordingly, {{and where}} indicated, previous and newly inferred meanings of taxonomic names are individuated {{according to one}} specific source. Articulations among these concepts and pairwise, logically consistent alignments of original and revisionary classifications are also provided, in addition to conventional nomenclatural provenance information. A phylogenetic revision of the <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>weevil</b> genera Minyomerus Horn, 1876 sec. O'Brien & Wibmer (1982), and Piscatopus Sleeper, 1960 sec. O'Brien & Wibmer (1982) (Curculionidae [non-focal]: Entiminae [non-focal]: Tanymecini [non-focal]) is presented. Prior to this study, Minyomerus sec. O'Brien & Wibmer (1982) contained seven species, whereas the monotypic Piscatopus sec. O'Brien & Wibmer (1982) was comprised solely of P. griseus Sleeper, 1960 sec. O'Brien & Wibmer (1982). We thoroughly redescribe these recognized species-level entities and furthermore describe ten species as new to science: M. bulbifrons sec. Jansen & Franz (2015) (henceforth: [JF 2015]), sp. n., M. aeriballux [JF 2015], sp. n., M. cracens [JF 2015], sp. n., M. gravivultus [JF 2015], sp. n., M. imberbus [JF 2015], sp. n., M. reburrus [JF 2015], sp. n., M. politus [JF 2015], sp. n., M. puticulatus [JF 2015], sp. n., M. rutellirostris [JF 2015], sp. n., and M. trisetosus [JF 2015], sp. n. A cladistic analysis using 46 morphological characters of 22 terminal taxa (5 / 17 outgroup/ingroup) yielded a single most-parsimonious cladogram (L = 82, CI = 65, RI = 82). The analysis strongly supports the monophyly of Minyomerus [JF 2015] with eight unreversed synapomorphies, and places P. griseus sec. O'Brien & Wibmer (1982) within the genus as sister to M. rutellirostris [JF 2015]. Accordingly, Piscatopus sec. Sleeper (1960), syn. n. is changed to junior synonymy of Minyomerus [JF 2015], and its sole member P. griseus sec. Sleeper (1960) is moved to Minyomerus [JF 2015] as M. griseus [JF 2015], comb. n. In addition, the formerly designated type M. innocuus Horn, 1876 sec. Pierce (1913), syn. n. is changed to junior synonymy of M. microps (Say, 1831) [JF 2015] which has priority. The genus is widespread throughout western North America, ranging from Canada to Mexico and Baja California. Apparent patterns of interspecific diversity of exterior and genitalic morphology, varying host plant ranges, overlapping and widely extending species distributions, suggest an early origin for Minyomerus [JF 2015], with a diversification that likely followed the development of North American desert biomes. Three species in the genus – i. e., M. languidus Horn, 1876 [JF 2015], M. microps [JF 2015], and M. trisetosus [JF 2015] – are putatively considered parthenogenetic...|$|E
40|$|The <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>weevil</b> (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Entiminae) fauna of New Zealand is diverse, but the {{taxonomy}} {{of the group}} has been little studied since the work of Thomas Broun in the late 1800 s, despite the economic, evolutionary and conservation interest of the group. This PhD revised {{the taxonomy}} of the species described by Broun in the genus Catoptes Schönherr and placed by Guillermo Kuschel in the genus Irenimus Pascoe. Over 7000 specimens were inspected, including type specimens of previously described species, and a combination of museum and fresh collections representing all major New Zealand regions and habitats. It also inferred relationships between species using molecular phylogenetics, determined species' environmental niche space though analysis of geographic ranges, and investigated possible influences {{on the evolution of}} particular characters. This was conducted within an overall framework of evaluating the group's fulfilment of four criteria that define adaptive radiations, being: 1) common ancestry, 2) phenotypic-environmental correlation, 3) increased fitness, and 4) rapid speciation. The group of species described by Broun in Catoptes was found to be polyphyletic. Irenimus contains only six species; the characters that define the genus being a complete metanepisternal suture, and a broad bevel at the apex of the hind tibia. Three new genera are proposed to accommodate the remainder of species. Austromonticolus new genus contains five species confined to the alpine regions of Central Otago; these are characterised by having a complete metanepisternal suture, and by females having a single bursal sclerite. Alocommatus new genus, containing eight species, can be distinguished by the presence of a narrow furrow surrounding the eye, strongly declivous frons, and strong basal folds on the pronotum; most species are found in Marlborough and North Canterbury. Chalepistes new genus is the most speciose genus, with 53 species, and including the widespread and occasionally economically important species C. aequalis (Broun), C. compressus (Broun) and C. stolidus (Broun). It is distinguished by the absence of a metanepisternal suture, and by having at most a narrow, unclothed bevel at the apex of the hind tibiae. To infer a phylogeny that gives reliable estimates of relationships and dates of divergence, up to four genes (28 S, ArgK, CAD and COI) were sequenced from 316 individuals representing 106 species. A species tree was inferred from these data. Each of the four genera proposed in this research was found to be monophyletic. The genera of the Brachyolus group as proposed by Kuschel form a monophyletic group. Dates of divergence were determined by applying a molecular clock, and these analyses resulted in estimated crown ages of 3. 78 [...] 6. 04 mya for Irenimus, 1. 44 [...] 3. 13 mya for Austromonticolus, 2. 21 [...] 4. 12 mya for Alocommatus and 4. 42 [...] 7. 00 mya for Chalepistes. Analyses of the environmental preferences and distribution of each species showed that Chalepistes occupied the greatest environmental space, and exploited almost all available terrestrial environments in New Zealand. Four sympatric sister species pairs were found; however none of these are considered to be candidates for sympatric speciation due to asymmetrical ranges between the pairs. Little evidence for phenotype [...] environment correlation was found, the exception being a relationship between metatibial length and ecological habit. Sexually dimorphic species were found to have a significantly increased speciation rate, indicating that a form of sexual selection is occurring. The sexual dimorphism in these weevils is unusual in that it is females, as opposed to males, that possess any of five secondary sexual traits that can be exaggerated: 1) interstria 1 {{at the top of the}} elytral declivity prolonged into a tubercle, 2) elytral apex produced posteriorly or ventrally, 3) posterior margin of ventrite 4 developed into a broad lamina, 4) disc of ventrite 5 modified by swellings, tubercles, furrow or concavities, and 5) posterior margin of ventrite 5 being emarginate, with horns surrounding the genital opening in extreme cases. The degree of sexual dimorphism was found to proceed in a progressive fashion, and no correlation between sexually dimorphic traits was detected. Outcomes of this research include greater clarity in the classification of New Zealand Entiminae at the genus level and a modern taxonomic treatment of four genera at the species level. A phylogenetic foundation is produced which, together with the drawing together of geographic and habitat associations, is used here to provide some insights into the macroevolution of Entiminae...|$|E

But perhaps most efficient in destroying developing yellow starthistle seedheads is the larva of the yellow starthistle hairy weevil (Eustenopus villosus). Knapweed root weevil (Cyphocleonus achates) larvae bore into the roots of spotted and to a lesser extentely diffuse knapweed, sometimes killing off the entire plant.|$|R
