We show that R-ratings alter the shape of the distribution of critical reviews, shifting the distribution to the right. Moreover, even after controlling for other influences, R-ratings improve critical reviews, suggesting that producers not only seek <b>box</b> <b>office</b> <b>revenues,</b> but also critical acclaim...|$|R

However, they do better than their contemporaneous non-sequels, more so when they are released sooner (rather than later) after their parents, and when more (rather than fewer) intervening sequels come before them.
