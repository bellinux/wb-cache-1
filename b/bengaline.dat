50|$|<b>Bengaline</b> silk {{sold for}} $2.50 per yard in 1889 but was {{sometimes}} discounted {{to sell for}} $1.25 per yard. A heavy lined, long cloak for infants, with deep <b>bengaline</b> silk embroidery, retailed for $7.98 at a Manhattan, New York clothing shop, in 1893. Diagonal striped dresses featuring the fabric were popular {{in the spring of}} 1912.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bengaline</b> is a woven silk-and-cotton {{material}} {{which became}} fashionable {{for women and}} children to wear in the 1880s and 1890s. It offered the impression of genuine silk but was made with lesser amounts of silk than cotton. Lizzie Borden stated at her December 1892 inquest that {{she was wearing a}} dress made of <b>bengaline</b> silk on the morning she was accused of murdering her father and stepmother.|$|E
50|$|The fabric {{went out}} of fashion when {{completely}} smooth-surfaced materials became popular. Piqué, coachman's whipcord, diagonal serge, and surah are similar to <b>bengaline</b> silk. Surah was once known in France as silk serge.|$|E
30|$|The {{detection}} of Pinaceae resin in Ripolin paints is perhaps surprising, as critical reading of period technical literature seems {{to imply that}} oil-based enamels including resins in their formulations were considered of lower quality, and Ripolin cans, on the contrary, {{were among the first}} and highest quality enamel paints available in the French market [39]. Historically, the highest quality enamels consisted of only stand oil as vehicle. It {{is important to note that}} in the sample set studied, the only non-Ripolin sample analysed, <b>Bengaline</b> bleu outremer (HP 019), was the one for which the highest levels of resin diterpenes were detected.|$|E
30|$|The {{oil-based}} enamel paints, {{all made}} by Ripolin except one ultramarine blue paint made by <b>Bengaline,</b> another French firm; and Lefranc tube paints {{were applied to}} microscope slides using a fixed-thickness applicator to achieve a uniform film of approximately 100 – 200 microns. For this investigation paint samples were taken from films which had been stored at ambient temperature {{in a variety of}} light conditions (dark storage and ambient indoor light) for approximately 6  years. Additional liquid and dried paint samples were taken directly from paint cans for analysis: when well-sealed, some cans have preserved their content in the liquid phase for almost a century. The examined samples cover a broad range of colors and dates of manufacture. 20 Ripolin paint sample cards (“brochures”, each containing 20 – 86 swatches of paint), which represent the entire color range produced by the company in France and roughly cover the period 1897 – 1950, have been gathered and analysed as reported in an earlier study [19]; several examples are discussed here for comparison with the samples from cans. In total, 31 samples of historic reference paints were analyzed for this study. The paint sample from Kandinsky’s Leichtes 1930 (sample # 1, light blue paint from drip at edge), was provided by the MNAM, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris [32], and the sample from Picasso’s Pêcheur assis à la casquette, 1946 (sample # 5 from the back: drip of gray/white under “Antibes” in the artist’s writing) by the Musée Picasso, Antibes [7, 39]. The cold-pressed linseed oil used as a reference in the ESI–MS measurements was prepared by Leslie Carlyle as part of the HART (Historically Accurate Reconstructions Techniques) project [5]; linseed stand oil was Winsor and Newton, collection of AIC.|$|E
