5000|$|Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) is a {{transducer}} for non-contact sound {{generation and}} reception using electromagnetic mechanisms. EMAT is an ultrasonic nondestructive testing (NDT) method {{which does not}} require contact or couplant, because the sound is directly generated within the material adjacent to the transducer. Due to this couplant-free feature, EMAT is particularly useful for automated inspection, and hot, cold, clean, or dry environments. EMAT is an ideal transducer to generate Shear Horizontal (SH) <b>bulk</b> <b>wave</b> mode, Surface Wave, Lamb waves {{and all sorts of}} other guided-wave modes in metallic and/or ferromagnetic materials. As an emerging ultrasonic testing (UT) technique, EMAT can be used for thickness measurement, flaw detection, and material property characterization. After decades of research and development, EMAT has found its applications in many industries such as primary metal manufacturing and processing, automotive, railroad, pipeline, boiler and pressure vessel industries.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose to}} {{describe}} <b>bulk</b> <b>wave</b> functions of fractional quantum HALL states {{in terms of}} correlators of non-unitary b/c-spin systems. These yield a promising conformal field theory analogon of the composite fermion picture of JAIN. Fractional statistics is described by twist fields which naturally appear in the b/c-spin systems. We provide a geometrical interpretation of our approach in which <b>bulk</b> <b>wave</b> functions are seen as holomorphic functions over a ramified covering of the complex plane, where the ramification precisely resembles the fractional statistics of the quasi-particle excitations in terms of branch points on the complex plane. To extend JAIN’s main series, we use the concept of composite fermions pairing to spin singlets, which enjoys a natural description {{in terms of the}} particular c = − 2 b/c-spin system as known from the HALDANE-REZAYI state. In this way we derive conformal field theory proposals for lowest LANDAU level <b>bulk</b> <b>wave</b> functions for more general filling fractions.

Furthermore, our scheme fits together with classifications in terms of K-matrices of effective multilayer theories leading to striking restrictions of these coupling matrices...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{generation}} and characterization of <b>bulk</b> <b>waves</b> in thick aluminum sample using laser-based ultrasonics. Nd-YAG laser is used for ultrasonic generation and He-Ne Laser Heterodyne interferometer is used for detection. Ultrasonic signals thus obtained are quite complicated and difficult to analyse due to different kind of waves (Pressure, Shear and Rayleigh) generated simultaneously. To generate <b>bulk</b> <b>waves,</b> a thick stepped sample of Aluminium is used. The geometry of the sample is such that the center point of each step lies on an arc of a circle. This {{is to ensure that}} the time of flight of the <b>bulk</b> <b>waves</b> is constant for all angles of incidence. The ultrasonic signals obtained with this sample are analysed using continuous wavelet transforms and then the pattern recognition is performed using Moment Invariants. Pressure waves and Shear waves are identified successfully by establishing pattern similarity at different locations within the signal. Both qualitative as well as quantitative analysis has been performed to validate the results. This paper successfully brings out the utility of the wavelet transforms based pattern recognition technique in the analysis of complex transient signals. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple treatment of elastic wave scattering at periodically structured surfaces and interfaces of solids, {{and the existence}} and nature of surface acoustic waves (SAW) and interfacial (IW) waves at such structures. Our treatment is embodied in phenomenological models in which the periodicity resides in the boundary conditions. These yield zone folding and band gaps at the boundary of, and within the Brillouin zone. Above the transverse <b>bulk</b> <b>wave</b> threshold, there occur leaky or pseudo-SAW and pseudo-IW, which are attenuated via radiation into the <b>bulk</b> <b>wave</b> continuum. These have a pronounced effect on the transmission and reflection of bulk waves. We provide examples of pseudo-SAW and pseudo-IW for which the coupling to the <b>bulk</b> <b>wave</b> continuum vanishes at isloated points in the dispersion relation. These supersonic guided waves correspond to embedded discrete eigenvalues within a radiation continuum. We stress the generality of the phenomena that are exhibited at widely different scales of length and frequency, and their relevance to situations {{as diverse as the}} guiding of seismic waves in mine stopes, the metrology of periodic metal interconnect structures in the semiconductor industry, and elastic wave scattering by an array of coplanar cracks in a solid...|$|E

40|$|A {{great deal}} of work on Lamb waves {{has been devoted to}} their {{application}} to materials which are assumed to be elastic and hence have negligible material attenuation (see e. g.

However for materials such as polyethylene, the assumption of elasticity may be invalid as the amplitude of the Lamb waves will decrease with propagation distance, a phenomenon not accounted for in the elastic treatment. From a dispersion curve point of view, the interest lies in determining whether the inclusion of attenuation will greatly change their characteristics. In most, if not all, circumstances the <b>bulk</b> shear <b>wave</b> attenuation for any given material is considerably larger than that for the <b>bulk</b> longitudinal <b>wave.</b> Given that Lamb waves can be modelled by the superposition of such <b>bulk</b> <b>waves,</b> it is believed that the shear wave attenuation will be the dominant factor on the character of the dispersion curves...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of the elastic constants of Inconel- 625 from the analysis of laser-generated ultrasonic <b>bulk</b> <b>waves.</b> A pulsed Nd/YAG laser (1064  nm) is used for ultrasonic generation in a thick stepped Inconel- 625 sample, and a He–Ne laser is used for heterodyne detection of the laser-generated signals. Ultrasonic signals obtained at epicenter and at off-epicenter position of the detection points are analyzed using wavelet transforms. Here, the identification of pressure as well as shear waves and the estimation of their velocities are done successfully. From the estimated velocities, the elastic constants (Young’s modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus, Lames constant and Poisson’s ratio) are calculated. The agreement of these constants with the standard values confirms the identification of shear waves at off-epicenter position. The work presented in this paper brings out the applicability of the study of laser-generated <b>bulk</b> <b>waves</b> for the determination of elastic constants of any bulk material.|$|R
