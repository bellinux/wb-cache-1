5|$|Following the restoration, William Bruce was {{appointed}} Clerk to the <b>Bills</b> <b>in</b> 1660, and Clerk of Supply to the Lords in Council in 1665. Both were lucrative positions, involving collection of fees, from Parliament {{in the first}} case, and from petitioners to the Court of Session in the latter. Meanwhile, Sir Robert Moray had {{established himself as a}} courtier and scientist at Whitehall, London, and employed Bruce as a trusted messenger between Whitehall and the Duke of Lauderdale, Secretary for Scotland.|$|E

50|$|Legislation {{to extend}} {{marriage}} rights to same-sex couples by amending the statute {{has been introduced}} in the Pennsylvania General Assembly several times. In May 2009, State Senator Daylin Leach introduced such a <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> the Senate. State Representative Babette Josephs also introduced a similar <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> the House of Representatives. Both <b>bills</b> remained <b>in</b> committee.

5|$|New York won the {{following}} week against Minnesota before facing the Buffalo <b>Bills</b> <b>in</b> their regular season home finale. Despite holding a significant advantage in time of possession, they lost 17–13, for their third loss in four games. To compound New York's problems, Phil Simms went down with an injury that would sideline him {{for the rest of}} the year. His replacement, Jeff Hostetler, was an unproven career backup, who had thrown a mere 68 passes coming into the season.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{volatile}} issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by gold and silver, or by gold alone. The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard. Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government <b>bills</b> <b>in</b> silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply.|$|E

5|$|Through the 1920s and 1930s, Trotter {{subsided}} into a genteel poverty, {{using the}} Guardian {{as an ongoing}} voice of protest. He lobbied for anti-lynching <b>bills</b> <b>in</b> Congress, with limited success. Even when the House overwhelmingly passed such a bill in 1922, the Southern bloc in the Senate filibustered and effectively killed passage of the bill for three years running. (White Democrats effectively controlled nearly all the Congressional seats apportioned to {{the total population of}} the South, after having disfranchised blacks.) They controlled chairmanships of numerous important committees, which were established by seniority.|$|E
5|$|After socialist {{gains in}} the legislature, the Argentine {{government}} introduced several <b>bills</b> <b>in</b> May 1914 which would have put the battleships up for sale, {{but they were all}} defeated by late June. Following the commencement of the First World War, the German and British ambassadors to the United States both complained to the US State Department; the former believed that the British were going to be given the ships as soon as the ships reached Argentina, and the latter considered it the responsibility of the United States to ensure that the ships never left Argentina's possession. International armament companies attempted to get Argentina to sell to one of the smaller Balkan countries and expected that the ships would then find their way into the war.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Bojić was in his final year at the University of Belgrade and had gotten engaged to his girlfriend, Radmila Todorović. The war {{put a stop to}} his education, and Bojić decided to postpone the marriage until peace was restored. He remained employed at Pijemont until 1915, when he left Belgrade with his family, never to return. While Todorović remained in the city, the Bojićes moved to the town of Aranđelovac in the Serbian interior. Shortly after, they moved to Niš as it was further from the frontlines. There, Bojić worked as a military censor. He wrote articles for the Niš Gazette (Niški glasnik) to pay his family's <b>bills.</b> <b>In</b> early February 1915, Bojić's mother died of cancer, leaving him {{to take care of his}} younger siblings.|$|E

The Senate amendments required the bill to return to the Assembly, which approved the amended version on August 30 {{by a vote of}} 60-16 with 4 Assemblymen not voting. No Assembly members who supported the <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> the first vote opposed the <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> the second vote.

5|$|Before {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, the {{sovereign}} always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Imperial State Crown, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds {{and members of the}} royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from the Bar of the Lords, just outside the chamber. The Clerk of the Parliaments presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker. The Clerk of the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, then read aloud the titles of the <b>bills</b> (<b>in</b> earlier times, the entire text of the bills). The Clerk of the Parliaments, standing on the sovereign's left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.|$|E
5|$|Chelvanayakam was re-elected in the March 1960 {{parliamentary}} election {{which resulted in}} a hung parliament. The new Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake tried to get ITAK's support for his minority government but refused to give into ITAK's demands to end state-sponsored colonisation of Tamil-majority areas by Sinhalese, regional autonomy and the rights of Indian Tamils. As a result, ITAK started negotiations with the opposition SLFP who agreed to introduce the provisions of the B-C pact as <b>bills</b> <b>in</b> parliament. During the negotiations on forming an alternate stable government Chelvanayakam informed the Governor-General that ITAK would support a SLFP government for a full term and as result the Governor-General dissolved parliament.|$|E
5|$|Gillibrand's legal {{representation}} of Philip Morris was again an issue. Her campaign finance records showed {{that she received}} $18,200 from Philip Morris employees for her 2008 campaign, putting her among the top dozen Democrats in such contributions. Questioned during the campaign about her {{work on behalf of}} Philip Morris, Gillibrand stated that she had voted in favor of all three anti-tobacco <b>bills</b> <b>in</b> that session of Congress. She said that she never hid her work for Philip Morris, and she added that as an associate at her law firm, she had had no control over which clients she worked for. The New York Times, reporting on this issue, said that Davis Polk's official policy was that associates were allowed to withdraw from representing clients about whom they had moral qualms.|$|E
