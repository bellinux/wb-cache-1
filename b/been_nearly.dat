5|$|A {{series of}} strong and {{damaging}} aftershocks persisted for about three-and-a-half months. The {{largest in the}} sequence came on May 8. The event caused additional destruction to the northeast of the initial meizoseismal area. Qatur, which had <b>been</b> <b>nearly</b> destroyed by the mainshock, took another serious hit. Other villages (Chaliyan, Givaran, Mir 'Umar, and Ravyan) also experienced major destruction. Shikaryazi was a village in the southeast region {{that had not been}} seriously affected by the mainshock, but experienced heavy damage during the May 8 event. This shock resulted in four additional deaths.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945, one globe {{allegedly}} {{owned by}} Hitler {{was found by}} American soldier John Barsamia among {{the ruins of the}} Kehlsteinhaus ("Eagle's Nest"), a personal retreat near the Bavarian Alps used by Hitler on several occasions before the war. The complex had <b>been</b> <b>nearly</b> completely looted by the time Barsamia arrived. He took the globe home and kept it for 60 years before selling it at an auction in San Francisco in 2007. Bob Pritikin, an entrepreneur from San Francisco, bought the globe for $100,000, five times the original estimated price of $20,000.|$|E

5|$|Persoonia levis {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, {{mainly because of}} {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination is unpredictable, and cuttings have <b>been</b> <b>nearly</b> impossible to strike. Nevertheless, its colourful bark and leaves are attractive horticultural features. Well-drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for the plant in a garden situation. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells and grows fairly readily, albeit slowly, in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England germinated seed as early as 1795.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Marine Provisional Brigade, in {{conjunction}} with Task Force Hill, mounted a massive offensive on Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni on August 17. At first tenacious North Korean defense halted the Marines' push. The North Koreans then mounted a counterattack following this in hopes of pushing the Marines back, but this failed disastrously. By nightfall on August 18, the North Korean 4th Division had <b>been</b> <b>nearly</b> annihilated and Obong-ni and Cloverleaf Hill had been retaken by US forces. The next day, {{the remains of the}} 4th Division withdrew completely across the river. In their hasty retreat, they left a large number of artillery pieces and equipment behind which the Americans used.|$|E
5|$|The Mahdists withdrew to the {{fortified}} town of Rejaf, while Chaltin's column {{marched in}} pursuit for seventeen miles until the occupied town was sighted at about one-thirty in the afternoon. A battery of artillery pieces fired on the Belgians {{as they came}} within range, but the effect was negligible. As the Belgians approached, a hidden force of Mahdists emerged from a ravine near {{the bank of the}} Nile and attacked Chaltin's flank. The commandant realized the threat in time and repulsed the attack without much loss. Chaltin's companies then turned to begin the attack on the town. For several hours Chaltin's companies pushed through the streets and houses of Rejaf, forcing the Mahdists back until by seven o'clock they had <b>been</b> <b>nearly</b> expelled entirely. Only the citadel remained occupied, but by dawn the next morning the remaining Mahdist forces retreated, leaving behind their weapons and munitions.|$|E

5|$|With World War I {{raging in}} Europe, Szilard {{received}} notice on January 22, 1916, {{that he had}} been drafted into the 5th Fortress Regiment, but he was able to continue his studies. He enrolled as an engineering student at the Palatine Joseph Technical University, which he entered in September 1916. The following year he joined the Austro-Hungarian Army's 4th Mountain Artillery Regiment, but immediately was sent to Budapest as an officer candidate. He rejoined his regiment in May 1918 but in September, before being sent to the front, he fell ill with Spanish Influenza and was returned home for hospitalization. Later he was informed that his regiment had <b>been</b> <b>nearly</b> annihilated in battle, so the illness probably saved his life. He was discharged honorably in November 1918, {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began on}} Kirby Muxloe Castle in October 1480, under the {{direction}} of Roger Bowlott, who was Lord Hasting's steward and became the clerk of works for the project. Most of the existing manor house was protected during the work, and probably continued in use while the new castle was built around it. A workshop able to make up to 100,000 bricks a week was constructed by Antony Yzebrond from Flanders. A brook was redirected to feed the new moat and a garden was established alongside the castle. Work intensified in early 1481, with the stonework being supervised by John Cowper, a master mason. The work progressed at speed and, at peak periods, over 40 men were working on the site. It is uncertain exactly how much of the castle was constructed, although at least one corner tower had <b>been</b> <b>nearly</b> completed by 1483 and the ground floor of the gatehouse laid down.|$|E
5|$|When the Secretary of State for Defence {{announced}} the {{contract for the}} vessels, the cost was initially estimated at £3.9billion. The contracts were officially signed one year later on 3 July 2008, after the creation of BVT Surface Fleet through the merger of BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions and VT Group's VT Shipbuilding which was a requirement of the UK Government. At the time of approval the first carrier was expected to enter service in July 2015 and the budget was £4,085m for two ships. The financial crisis led to a decision in December 2008 to slow production, delaying the first ship until May 2016 and the second by two years. This decision alone added £1,560m to the cost. By March 2010 the budget was estimated at £5,900m; taking off the cost of capital led to a MPR10 Capital DEL baseline cost of £5,254m at this time. If the carriers had been abandoned in the 2010 SDSR then the MoD could have cancelled £1.5bn of planned spending on Queen Elizabeth and £1.3bn of planned spending on Prince of Wales, but the loss of VAT exemption meant that cancelling one or two carriers would have overall saved £989m and £2,098m respectively. These long term savings were {{less important than the}} short term costs, there would have <b>been</b> <b>nearly</b> an extra £1bn of expenditure on cancellation costs in the FY11/12 budget. In November 2013 the contract was renegotiated with a budget of £6,200m and BAE agreeing to pay 50% of any cost overruns rather than 10% as previously.|$|E
