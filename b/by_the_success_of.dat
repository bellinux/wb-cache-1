5000|$|Thalberg <b>by</b> <b>the</b> late 19th {{century was}} often only characterised as [...] "Old Arpeggio"; his musical {{innovations}} were unrecognised {{or had been}} forgotten.

5|$|Although {{no longer}} {{employed}} by the New Zealand Company, Heaphy, emboldened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> his report and the public reception to his paintings, sought further opportunities for similar work. From London, he wrote to the company secretary seeking support for exploration of the area inland of Nelson.

Despite this, Heaphy returned to New Zealand and arrived in Nelson on 22 December 1842.|$|E
5|$|Bastei Verlag, enamoured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> Bessy, asked Vandersteen {{to provide}} a second weekly series. With the {{popularity}} of superheroes, especially Batman, in Belgium and Germpany in these years, Vandersteen proposed a spinoff series of Suske en Wiske, based on Jerom, the strongman of the series. Called Wastl in German, 173 stories were produced between 1968 and 1972, with a publication that reached 150,000 copies at its summit. The best of these stories were published in Dutch as well, just like it {{was done with the}} later Bessys, but the weakness of the stories ended the series after only four years.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, the consent decree of 1948 forcing film studios to divest {{themselves}} of theater chains and the competitive pressure of television had caused significant financial distress at MGM. In a gamble {{to save the}} studio, and inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> Paramount Pictures' 1956 Biblical epic The Ten Commandments, studio head Joseph Vogel announced in 1957 that MGM would again move forward on a remake of Ben-Hur. Filming started in May 1958 and wrapped in January 1959, and post-production took six months. Although the budget for Ben-Hur was initially $7 million, it {{was reported to be}} $10 million by February 1958, reaching $15.175 million by the time shooting began—making it the costliest film ever produced up to that time. When adjusted for inflation, the budget of Ben Hur was approximately $ in constant dollars.|$|E

50|$|The {{hotel was}} not an {{immediate}} success. It was leased <b>by</b> <b>the</b> consortium to James Worthington and losses led to the operation being returned to the consortium to run.

5|$|Encouraged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> his frigates in the Java Sea, Pellew mustered a {{significant}} {{force in the}} early autumn of 1806, including four ships of the line, two frigates and a brig with which to eliminate the remaining Dutch squadron. Reaching the Sunda Strait on 23 November, Pellew passed by the port of Bantam and on 27 November reached Batavia, splitting his forces so that the lighter vessels sailed close to shore and the ships of the line remained in deeper water outside the channel entering the harbour. A corvette was captured, {{and the rest of}} the Dutch squadron was taken by surprise, mistaking Pellew's force for a French squadron. By the time their mistake was revealed, the harbour was already blocked and so Captain Vander Sande drove Phoenix ashore, followed by six other warships and 22 merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 the {{newspaper}} La Gazzetta dello Sport established the Giro d'Italia, inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> the Tour de France, {{which started in}} 1903. The first Giro was won by Luigi Ganna, while Carlo Galetti won the two following Giros. In 1912, there was no individual classification, instead {{there was only a}} team classification, which was won by Team Atala. The 1912 Giro is the only time the competition has not had an individual classification. From 1914 onwards the scoring format was changed from a points-based system to a time-based system, in which the cyclist who had the lowest aggregate time {{at the end of the}} race would win. The Giro was suspended for four years from 1915 to 1918, due to the First World War. Costante Girardengo was the winner of the first Giro after the war in 1919.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Hanna and Barbera jointly {{directed}} Puss Gets the Boot, {{which was}} nominated for an Academy Award for Best (Cartoon) Short Subject. The studio wanted a diversified cartoon portfolio, so despite the success of Puss Gets the Boot, Hanna and Barbera's supervisor, Fred Quimby, {{did not want to}} produce more cat and mouse cartoons. Surprised <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> Puss Gets the Boot, Hanna and Barbera ignored Quimby's resistance and continued developing the cat-and-mouse theme. By this time, however, Hanna wanted to return to working for Ising, to whom he felt very loyal. Hanna and Barbera met with Quimby, who discovered that although Ising had taken sole credit for producing Puss Gets the Boot, he never actually worked on it. Quimby then gave Hanna and Barbera permission to pursue their cat-and-mouse idea. The result was their most famous creation, Tom and Jerry.|$|E
50|$|The {{objectives}} of Tugendbund were apparently pedagogical. However, some members, encouraged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish revolt, were persuaded {{that they needed}} more direct military action against France. In April 1809 Friedrich von Katte, former Prussian officer led a revolt in Westphalia aiming to seize Magdeburg. However, he failed to rouse the local population and decamping and scattering his military body of volunteers returned to Berlin, where he was arrested.|$|R

5|$|Meyerbeer's immense wealth (increased <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> his operas) and his {{continuing}} {{adherence to}} his Jewish religion set him apart somewhat {{from many of}} his musical contemporaries. They also gave rise to rumours that his success was due to his bribing musical critics. Richard Wagner (see below) {{accused him of being}} interested only in money, not music. Meyerbeer was, however, a deeply serious musician and a sensitive personality. He philosophically resigned himself to being a victim of his own success: his extensive diaries and correspondence – which survived the turmoil of 20th-century Europe and have now been published in eight volumes – are an invaluable source for the history of music and theatre in the composer's time.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June, the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division {{attacked}} {{with the}} 152nd (Highland) Infantry Brigade.

The Highlanders were counter-attacked by Kampfgruppe von Luck of the 21st Panzer Division during the morning but by midday the village was firmly in British hands. German attention and resources were diverted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> the Highlanders as VIII Corps prepared for further attacks out of the Orne bridgehead.|$|E
