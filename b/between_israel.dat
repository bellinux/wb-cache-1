5|$|Until 2000, non-Muslim {{visitors}} {{could enter}} the Al-Aqsa Mosque {{by getting a}} ticket from the Waqf. That procedure ended when the Second Intifada began. Fifteen years later, negotiation <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> and Jordan might result in allowing visitors to enter once again.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{emphasized}} {{a careful}} {{approach to the}} conflict <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> and the Palestinians; he denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Bush supported Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death.|$|E

5|$|In 1991 Menem {{became the}} first head of state of Argentina to make a {{diplomatic}} visit to Israel. He proposed to mediate <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> and Syria in their negotiations over the Golan Heights.

5|$|Myron Kinberg {{was hired}} as rabbi in 1977. Ordained in Reform Judaism, he had {{previously}} served as a rabbi in Topeka, Kansas for two years, then lived in Israel for two years, before coming to Eugene.

5|$|When the QIZ program {{came into}} being in 1996, {{observers}} regarded it {{as a vehicle to}} support the development of peaceful relations and normalization of commercial ties <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> and the two Arab states (Jordan and Egypt) with which it had signed peace treaties. In both cases, however, a tenuous peace continues to prevail <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> and the two Arab states. Since the conclusion of the JordanIsrael peace treaty in October 1994, large numbers of Jordanians, particularly fundamentalists, those of Palestinian origin, and members of the professional unions continue to oppose normalization with Israel and resist the expansion of commercial relations. With the establishment of 13 QIZs in Jordan, there has been an increase in the volume of bilateral trade, though the overall totals remain modest.|$|E

5|$|In November 2012, {{after a week}} of {{conflict}} <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> and Palestinian militant groups, a ceasefire brokered by Egypt was announced on November 21. UN OCHA says 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. According to an analysis by the New York Times, men ages 20–29, {{who are most likely to}} be militants, are most overrepresented in the death toll.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, Israel: Politics, Myths and Identity Crises was published, a {{collection}} of Orr's essays that also dealt with issues arising from the clash <b>between</b> <b>Israel's</b> secular and Jewish identities. By this time, Orr had moved back to Israel (in 1990).|$|R

5|$|In the 1994 Peace Agreement <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> and Jordan it {{was decided}} that {{operations}} were supposed to be transferred from Eilat Airport to Aqaba Airport. The original plan was to rename Aqaba Airport as Aqaba-Eilat Peace International Airport. The agreement was never followed, however, and an agreement between the two countries in March 1997, stipulated that domestic flights would continue to use Eilat Airport, whilst no further action to move international flights took place.|$|E
5|$|Myths {{continued}} to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem {{from the fact that}} in early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, a claim {{for which there is no}} evidence.|$|E
5|$|The IAF {{began working}} on a SAM {{suppression}} operation {{since the end of}} the Yom Kippur War. Rising tensions <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> and Syria over Lebanon escalated in the early 1980s and culminated in Syria deploying the SAM batteries in the Beqaa Valley. On June 6, 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon, and on the third day of the war, with clashes going on between the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Syrian Army, Israel decided to launch the operation.|$|E

5|$|The Israeli Defense Minister Israel Navon (Doron Tavory) {{moves to}} {{a house on the}} border <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> and the West Bank, with the {{building}} sitting on the Israeli side just next to the dividing line. The Israeli Secret Service views the neighboring lemon grove of Salma Zidane (Hiam Abbass), a Palestinian widow whose family has cared for the area for generations, {{as a threat to the}} minister and his wife. The security forces soon set up a guard post and a fence around the grove. They then obtain an order to uproot the lemon trees.|$|E
5|$|The battles began {{shortly after}} the Israeli {{declaration}} of independence, when Syria shelled Ein Gev {{on the night of}} May 15–16. They were the first military engagement <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> and Syria. On May 18, Syria attacked the Israeli forward position in Samakh (Tzemah), and on May 20 attacked Degania Alef and occupied Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan. The attack on Degania Alef was a failure, after which the Syrian forces attempted to capture Degania Bet. After reaching a stalemate, they retreated to their initial position in Tel al-Qasr, where they remained {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{retained}} {{an active}} {{interest in the}} running of these British institutions abroad; in 1967 he visited the British School in Jerusalem amid the Six-Day War <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> and its Arab neighbours, and in January 1968 visited the Persian institute with the archaeologist Max Mallowan and Mallowan's wife Agatha Christie, there inspecting the excavations at Siraf.

The position became a salaried, professional one, with the numismatist Derek Allen taking on the position.|$|E

5|$|By October 6 the Egyptian naval {{task force}} was at Bab-el-Mandeb where they broke radio silence. When Operation Badr began at 14:00, Rear Admiral Fuad Abu Zikry {{authorized}} the fleet {{to proceed with}} the blockade via a codeword. Egyptian submarines and destroyers intercepted ships traveling through Bab-el-Mandeb destined for Eilat, and all Israeli maritime navigation in the Red Sea ceased. The blockade was a strategic success for Egypt, while the Israeli Navy and Air Force were incapable of lifting the blockade due to the long distance <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> and Bab-el-Mandeb. Mines were laid {{at the entrance to the}} Gulf of Suez to prevent Israel from transporting oil from the Sinai fields to Eilat. Historian Gammal Hammad claims that a blockade was also enforced in the Mediterranean, while other sources dispute this. News of the blockade was censored in Israel.|$|E
5|$|For example, the Security Council passed no resolutions on {{most major}} Cold War conflicts, {{including}} the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–Afghan War. Resolutions addressing more current problems, {{such as the}} conflict <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> and Palestine and Iran's suspected development of nuclear weapons, are also heavily influenced by the veto, actual or threatened. Additionally, the veto applies to {{the selection of the}} UN's Secretary-General, as well as any amendments to the UN Charter, giving the P5 great influence over these processes. Recently China also exercised its VETO on India's Resolution to put Masood Azhar on list of Global terrorist list. He is proclaimed head of Jaish E Mohammad a terror Outfit which is already designated as Global terrorist group by UNSC.|$|E
5|$|George VI's reign saw the {{acceleration}} of {{the dissolution of the}} British Empire. The Statute of Westminster 1931 had already acknowledged the evolution of the Dominions into separate sovereign states. The process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states, known as the Commonwealth, gathered pace after the Second World War. During the ministry of Clement Attlee, British India became the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan in 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India, and became King of India and King of Pakistan instead. In 1950 he ceased to be King of India when it became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations and recognised his new title of Head of the Commonwealth; he remained King of Pakistan until his death. Other countries left the Commonwealth, such as Burma in January 1948, Palestine (divided <b>between</b> <b>Israel</b> and the Arab states) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949.|$|E
