50|$|Sven Gustaf Wingqvist (10 December 1876 - 17 April 1953) was a Swedish engineer, {{inventor}} and industrialist, {{and one of}} {{the founders}} of Svenska Kullagerfabriken (SKF), one of the world's leading <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> and <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> makers. Sven Wingqvist invented the multi-row self-aligning <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> in 1907.|$|R
50|$|Rolling-element {{bearings}} {{are manufactured}} in two forms: <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> slides and <b>roller</b> slides.|$|R
50|$|All bells {{retain their}} cast canons.The timber frame {{dates from the}} early C17, and was {{repaired}} by John Taylor & Co in 1965/6 when the four bells were quarter turned, renovated with new independent crown staples, new fittings for swing chiming consisting of seasoned elm headstocks, wrought iron levers, steel gudgeons, fully enclosed <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> clappers with new joints and <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>rollers.</b> In 1992 the frame was strengthened further by volunteers to a design by Eayre and Smith Ltd to allow for full circle ringing and the necessary additional fittings provided. A service of thanksgiving was held on September 26, 1992.|$|R
50|$|Thrust {{bearings}} {{are used}} to support axial loads, such as vertical shafts. Common designs are Thrust <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> spherical <b>roller</b> thrust <b>bearings,</b> tapered <b>roller</b> thrust <b>bearings</b> or cylindrical <b>roller</b> thrust <b>bearings.</b> Also non-rolling-element bearings such as hydrostatic or magnetic bearings see some use where particularly heavy loads or low friction is needed.|$|R
40|$|Shaftings with {{frictionless}} bearings {{are considered}} in the paper. Determi-nation problems of load limits of supports with <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> and <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are solved. Conditions of installation several bearings in the support are investi-gated. Durability changes of bearings are analyzed. Calculation examples of loads on the supports are given...|$|R
50|$|The <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> and {{cylindrical}} <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> are over-determined, {{having more}} points of contact than required for kinematic determinacy. This leads to decreased precision as the joints wear.|$|R

40|$|These {{tests were}} {{undertaken}} by the Bureau of Standards, {{at the request of}} the Navy Department, to obtain experimental data on the frictional resistance of both <b>ball</b> and <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> at very low speeds and also the loads which they will safely sustain.

5000|$|The ladder-type frame used semielliptical {{leaf springs}} front and rear. Steering {{included}} now <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> instead of <b>roller</b> types, and featured a Pitman arm {{in front of}} the front axle.|$|R
50|$|Compared to <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> and {{ordinary}} <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> needle bearings {{have a greater}} surface area {{in contact with the}} races, so they can support a greater load. They are also thinner, so they require less clearance between the axle and the surrounding structure.|$|R

5000|$|There are two {{designs for}} the 5LM60 input shaft and {{bearings}} (input shaft and main shaft). The first design 1988-1990 has a <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> with a <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> behind it. The second design has a much larger single <b>ball</b> <b>bearing.</b> The first design bearings are reputed to be failure prone. [...] The updated input shaft and bearings carried through to the NV3500.|$|R
50|$|In many applications, rolling-element <b>bearings,</b> such as <b>ball</b> or <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> have {{replaced}} Babbitt bearings. Though such bearings {{can offer a}} lower coefficient of friction than plain bearings, their key advantage {{is that they can}} operate reliably without a continuous pressurized supply of lubricant. <b>Ball</b> and <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> can also be used in configurations that are required to carry both radial and axial thrusts. However, rolling-element bearings lack the beneficial damping and shock-load capability provided by fluid-film bearings, such as the Babbitt.|$|R
50|$|Type-2 {{introduced}} removable shaft receivers for <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> {{and better}} <b>roller</b> angling {{that would have}} allowed one Mini 4WD to bounce in a less traumatic way {{on the walls of the}} tracks (or the shovels of the stick).|$|R
50|$|This type of rotary stage {{includes}} <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> stages, crossed <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> stages, {{and possibly}} others. Any {{of a number}} of different rolling-element bearings may be employed. Typically, a pair of bearings is used and they are preloaded to take up any slack which could result in the stage platform lifting relative to the base.|$|R

50|$|Motorized linear slides such as machine slides, XY tables, roller {{tables and}} some {{dovetail}} slides are bearings moved by drive mechanisms. Not all linear slides are motorized, and non-motorized dovetail slides, <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> slides and <b>roller</b> slides provide low-friction linear movement for equipment powered by inertia or by hand. All linear slides provide linear motion based on bearings, {{whether they are}} <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> dovetail <b>bearings,</b> linear <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> magnetic or fluid bearings. XY Tables, linear stages, machine slides and other advanced slides use linear motion bearings to provide movement along both X and Y multiple axis.|$|R

40|$|Powder {{metallurgy}} (PM) {{consists in}} obtaining pieces of powder metal that are processed at high temperatures and pressure. Due to its characteristic manufacturing process, the materials {{can have a}} specific and controlled porosity, which {{makes it possible to}} obtain porous parts such as <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> gears, and <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> etc. This porosity is what made us think about how easy biofouling would be on these materials and its possible environmental applications...|$|R

50|$|Leonardo da Vinci {{incorporated}} {{drawings of}} <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> in his {{design for a}} helicopter around the year 1500. This is the first recorded use of bearings in an aerospace design. However, Agostino Ramelli {{is the first to}} have published sketches of <b>roller</b> and thrust <b>bearings.</b> An issue with <b>ball</b> and <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> is that the balls or rollers rub against each other causing additional friction which can be reduced by enclosing the balls or rollers within a cage. The captured, or caged, <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> was originally described by Galileo in the 17th century.|$|R

5000|$|The {{second most}} {{important}} part of the rotary union is the bearing. A rotary union may have only one bearing, but multiple bearing are much more common. Roller bearings; such as <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> and tapered <b>roller</b> bearings; or non-roller bearings, like graphite bearings and bronze brushings, may be used in a rotary union. The bearings are always used to allow a part of the joint, either the shaft or the housing, to rotate ...|$|R
