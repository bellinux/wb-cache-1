5|$|In January 2005, Pinker defended Lawrence Summers, {{president}} of Harvard University, whose comments about a gender gap {{in mathematics and}} science angered much of the faculty. Pinker noted that Summers's remarks, properly understood, were hypotheses about overlapping statistical distributions of men's and women's talents and tastes, and that in a university such hypotheses ought to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> empirical testing rather than dogma and outrage. Edge.org ran a debate between Pinker and Elizabeth Spelke on gender and science.|$|E
5|$|In early September Marquis went to Lame Deer for the Cheyenne annual fair. There, Willis Rowland {{helped him}} compile {{a list of}} elderly Cheyennes. Although the Custer {{battlefield}} was on the Crow Reservation, the Crow {{had been on the}} US side during the Great Sioux War of 1876, of which the Custer battle was a part, and so would have no eyewitnesses to the battle, everybody fighting with Custer having been killed. Back in Lodge Grass, Marquis made two important contacts. In November, he had his first meeting with Thomas H. Leforge. Leforge lived among the Crow and had been a scout and interpreter for General Gibbon in the 1876 war. Leforge would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> the first book Marquis succeeded in publishing, Memoirs of a White Crow Indian. The second contact was William H.

The risk assessment comes about {{as the result of}} a joint Europol – EMCDDA report which concluded that BZP needs to be looked at in more detail. The results were published in June 2007. The report concluded that the use of BZP can lead to medical problems even if the long effects are still unknown. Taking this concession as a basis, the European Commission has decided to ask the Council to place BZP under control of the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. On 4 March 2008, the EU requested countries to place BZP under control within a year and France complied in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|Hargest and his brigade {{took part}} in the {{subsequent}} Battle of Crete in May. The 2nd New Zealand Division was under the command of Brigadier Edward Puttick due to Freyberg taking command of Creforce, which consisted of all the Allied troops on Crete. Puttick gave Hargest's brigade the task of defending the airfield at Maleme and its easterly approaches. The 21st Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Andrew, guarded the airfield itself and a neighbouring hill, Point 107, with the other two battalions of the brigade positioned further east while Hargest situated his headquarters at some distance from the airfield. Within days of arriving on Crete, the Allied positions began to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> strafing and bombing attacks by German planes as a precursor to an airborne invasion mounted by German paratroopers of the 1st Parachute Division. The bombing triggered in Hargest an occurrence of his shell shock, rendering him lethargic and confused.|$|E
5|$|In October 1971, the {{journalist}} Numa Sadoul conducted a wide-ranging interview with Hergé, {{in which the}} latter opened up about {{many of the problems}} he had experienced in his personal life. Sadoul planned to publish the interview as a book, but Hergé made many alterations to the transcript, both to improve its prose and to remove sections which cast him in a negative light. Editors at Casterman then removed even further sections, particularly those in which Hergé expressed a negative view of Catholicism. The interview was published as Tintin et moi ("Tintin and I") in 1975. Hergé followed this by agreeing to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> a documentary film produced by Henri Roane, Moi, Tintin ("I, Tintin"), which premiered in 1975.|$|E

5|$|Not every {{question}} or every criminal case was {{eligible for a}} certificate of division. In United States v. Daniel (1821), the Court held that a motion for a new trialas authorized by the § 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789could not <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> a certificate of division; rather, the division would operate {{a rejection of the}} motion. Similarly, in United States v. Bailey (1835), the Court held that {{the question of whether the}} evidence was legally sufficient to support the offense charged could not be certified. In United States v. Briggs (Briggs I) (1847), the Court further limited its jurisdiction to hear criminal certificates of division by holding that the question of whether a demurrer to an indictment should be sustained was to general to be certified.|$|E
5|$|These {{provisions}} {{are similar to}} those set out in section 5 of the Theft Act 1968 in relation to theft. It is clearly a right of property ownership to deal with property as one wishes, including its damage or destruction. However a person setting fire to his own house which is subject to a mortgage can be charged because the mortgagee will have a proprietary right or interest in the property. Property that is abandoned has no owner, and cannot be stolen; it follows that such property cannot <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> a charge of criminal damage.|$|E
5|$|Though {{he was the}} team's second leading scorer, Tanguay {{continued}} to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> trade talks throughout the season. Set to become a restricted free agent in July 2006, the Avalanche chose to trade his negotiating rights to the Calgary Flames at the 2006 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for defenceman Jordan Leopold and two second round draft picks. Tanguay felt that the team chose to trade him after he {{failed to live up}} to the team's expectations in the playoffs even though he {{continued to}} struggle with his knee injury. The Flames quickly signed Tanguay to a three-year contract worth US$15.75 million.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{their initial}} lack of popularity, {{by the late}} 1990s the Treasury's supply of Anthony dollars began to dwindle due to their {{widespread}} use in vending machines (including more than 9,000 stamp machines situated in post offices across the United States) and mass transit turnstiles. Beginning in 1997, several bills were introduced to Congress {{with the intent of}} resuming mintage of small-sized dollar coins to keep up with demand. On March 20 of that year, Arizona Republican Representative Jim Kolbe introduced legislation calling for more dollar coins to be minted. Four months later, on July 24, Republican Representative Michael Castle of Delaware, a member of the House Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, also introduced legislation, calling for the Statue of Liberty to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> the design. On October 21, Minnesota Republican Rod Grams introduced a bill in the Senate, also calling for the mintage of a newly designed dollar coin. The final legislation authorizing the design and production of a new dollar coin was based on Grams' bill. Also on October 21, in a hearing before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade, and Technology, Treasury Department officials gave their support for a new dollar coin, recommending that it be gold-colored with a distinctive edge, to make it easily distinguishable from the quarter-dollar. During this hearing, Philip N. Diehl, then Director of the Mint, estimated that it would take thirty months to begin production of the new coin.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to another}} lockout, the 2012–13 season was delayed until January 2013. The Sedins this time {{remained}} in Canada, as {{they decided that}} would return to Modo only if the entire season again wound up cancelled. In the second month of the season, Henrik recorded his 757th point, surpassing Markus Näslund as the Canucks' all-time leading scorer. Two months later, Daniel also passed Näslund, scoring a goal and an assist in a 3–1 win against the Chicago Blackhawks, ranking the Sedins first and second in team history. Playing in just 47 games due to the lockout-shortened season, Daniel recorded 12 goals and 40 points. He ranked second in team scoring behind Henrik's 45 points. In the playoffs, he added three assists in a four-game defeat to the San Jose Sharks. The series ended on a shorthanded goal due to a penalty assessed to Daniel in overtime. In pursuit of a loose puck in the defensive zone, Daniel bodychecked Sharks forward Tommy Wingels into the boards, resulting in a boarding penalty. The call would later <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> controversy as it was believed {{by many in the}} media, such as National Post journalist Cam Cole, as well as teammates, such as Henrik, that Daniel had made contact with Wingels shoulder-to-shoulder, which according to NHL rules, should not result in a boarding penalty.|$|E

5|$|Most polar {{molecules}} {{have low}} solubility in the hydrocarbon {{core of a}} lipid bilayer and, as a consequence, have low permeability coefficients across the bilayer. This effect is particularly pronounced for charged species, which have even lower permeability coefficients than neutral polar molecules. Anions typically have {{a higher rate of}} diffusion through bilayers than cations. Compared to ions, water molecules actually have a relatively large permeability through the bilayer, as evidenced by osmotic swelling. When a cell or vesicle with a high interior salt concentration is placed in a solution with a low salt concentration it will swell and eventually burst. Such a result would not be observed unless water was able to pass through the bilayer with relative ease. The anomalously large permeability of water through bilayers is still not completely understood and continues to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> active debate. Small uncharged apolar molecules diffuse through lipid bilayers many orders of magnitude faster than ions or water. This applies both to fats and organic solvents like chloroform and ether. Regardless of their polar character larger molecules diffuse more slowly across lipid bilayers than small molecules.|$|E
