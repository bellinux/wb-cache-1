5000|$|The knights' {{tournament is}} held in the Piazza Grande, guided by the Maestro di Campo and preceded by the costume {{characters}} and the town's ancient banners entering the square accompanied {{by the sound of}} trumpets and drums. Some important moments can be defined {{at this stage of the}} event: the highest authorities of the Joust entering the square (the magistrates, the Jury, the quarters' presidents), the performance of flag-wavers, the jousters galloping into the racing field, each knight representing an ancient noble family of Arezzo, the knights' arrangement on the lizza (jousting track), the Herald reading the Challenge of <b>Buratto</b> (a poetic composition written in octaves in the 17th century), the crossbowmen and the soldiers greeting the crowd shouting [...] "Arezzo!", the magistrates' authorization to run the joust and finally the Joust's musicians playing the Saracen Hymn, composed by Giuseppe Pietri (1886-1946).|$|E
5000|$|Then, {{the real}} {{competition}} starts. The jousters {{of the four}} gates (the real protagonists of the event) gallop their horses with lance in rest against the Saracen, an armor-plated dummy representing a Saracen holding a cat-o'-nine-tails in his hand ("Buratto, King of the Indies"). The sequence of charges is drawn on the week preceding the joust during a costume ceremony in Piazza del Comune. It's almost impossible foreseeing what {{the result of the}} joust will be: it depends on the ability, the courage and the good-luck of the eight jousters who alternate on the packed-earth sloping track (the lizza) that runs transversally across Piazza Grande. The competition is won by the couple of knights who hit the Saracen’s shield obtaining the higher scores. The quarter associated to the winning knight receives the coveted golden lance. In the event of a draw between two or more quarters after the standard number of charges (two sets of charges for each jouster), the prize is assigned with one or more deciding charges. At the end of the joust, mortar shots hail the winning quarter. The rules of the tournament are contained in technical regulations that repeat - virtually unchanged - the Chapters for the <b>Buratto</b> Joust dating back to 1677. They are easy to understand, and yet worded {{in such a way as}} to guarantee a long-lasting suspense. The outcome of the fight between the Christian knights and the [...] "Infidel" [...] is undecided until the very last moment due to dramatic turns of events. For instance, jousters may be disqualified if they ride accidentally off the jousting track, or their scores may be doubled if their lance breaks after violently hitting the Saracen.|$|E
50|$|The Lions {{began the}} 2000 {{campaign}} {{with only one}} goal in mind: win the Grey Cup. Six months later, the Lions would fulfill that destiny, but {{the path to the}} 88th Grey Cup {{was one of the most}} adventurous, unpredictable, and memorable ever in CFL history. The year started well enough, with victories over Hamilton and Saskatchewan, but a 35-2 loss to Calgary began a four-game losing streak and a lot of finger-pointing. A win over the Toronto Argonauts halted the slide, but following the game, head coach Greg Mohns resigned to join the XFL. Long-time CFL coach Steve <b>Buratto,</b> who joined the club only two weeks earlier as a receivers coach, was promoted to the top job, and got instant results with a huge 51-4 win over the Argos in the second of back-to-back games. Despite a promising start, the Lions only won one of their next five games to sit at 5-9 on Thanksgiving. Nevertheless, the Lions came together when it counted themost, winning three of their last four heading into the playoffs, and the offence gelling to become the best in the CFL that season. Quarterback Damon Allen broke Ron Lancaster's CFL record for career passing yardage. Lui Passaglia played in a memorable, “Luv Ya Lui” night at his final game at B.C. Place, and also set a CFL record for single season field goal percentage. The Lions finished the year 8-10 and in third place in the Western Division, but were the team other teams did not want to face in the playoffs. A snarly defence started to show its grit, and the Lions roared confidently into Edmonton and emerged with a 34-32 Western semi-final victory, thanks to a Passaglia field goal on the final play. The Lions next faced Calgary in the Western finals, and the Lions steamrolled to a decisive 37-23 win. The Leos' Cinderella season came to a close on November 26, 2000, in the Grey Cup at McMahon Stadium in Calgary, as the Lions won their fourth championship in team history with a nail biting 28-26 victory over the Montreal Alouettes. Running back Robert Drummond won the Grey Cup's Most Valuable Player award, while backfield teammate Sean Millington took home the Grey Cup's Most Valuable Canadian trophy. The Lions' triumph marked the first time a team with a sub-.500 regular season record won the Grey Cup, and it signalled a marvellous end to Lui Passaglia's outstanding, 25-year CFL career.|$|E
40|$|If {{you think}} that white is the only color for lace [...] . think again! My {{research}} focuses {{on a group of}} polychrome Italian laces dating from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The category I have identified in the MMA lace collection is known as “embroidered laces” and includes the techniques of Filet and <b>Buratto.</b> These early lacemaking techniques are often characterized by the use of different materials for the foundation and for the embroidery (textile and metallic threads). Despite the visual variety represented by these Italian laces, they all share the same basic structure of a net foundation, making them a particularly interesting subset to study. While luxury fabrics and historical textiles in general have gained more interest during the last decades, laces are still seriously understudied. It {{is for this reason that}} I would be delighted to contribute to the development of this hitherto neglected field through an analytical approach. My research will concentrate on the technical aspects of the laces, aiming to study and identify their material components through analysis of the diverse types of fibers, dyes, and techniques of lacemaking unique to these examples. From an analytic point of view, the information available concerning Filet and <b>Buratto</b> is limited, as is the proper method of their classification. My project would help fill the gaps in knowledge of these laces, in terms of both technical information and classification methodology. A thorough documentation of these net background Italian laces in the MMA’s collection could become a significant contribution towards making this understudied field more accessible to conservation and curatorial investigation in the future...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE - To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} manufactured shoes specially designed for diabetic patients (Podiabetes by <b>Buratto</b> Italy) to prevent relapses of foot ulcerations. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A prospective multicenter randomized follow-up study of patients with previous foot ulcerations was conducted. Patients were alternatively assigned to wear either their own shoes (control group, C; n = 36) or therapeutic shoes (Podiabetes group, P; n = 33). The number of ulcer relapses was recorded during 1 -year follow-up. RESULTS - Both C and P groups had similar risk factors for foot ulceration (i. e., previous foot ulceration, mean vibratory perception threshold > 25 mV). After 1 year the foot ulcer relapses were significantly lower in P than in C (27. 7 vs. 58. 3 %, P = 0. 009; odds ratio 0. 26 [0. 2 - 1. 54]). In a multiple regression analysis, the use of therapeutic shoes was negatively associated with foot ulcer relapses (coefficient of variation = - 0. 315; 95 % confidence interval = - 0. 54 to - 0. 08; P = 0. 009). CONCLUSIONS - The use of specially designed shoes is effective in preventing relapses in diabetic patients with previous ulceration...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Partial {{atrioventricular}} septal defect (pAVSD) {{is routinely}} repaired {{with a low}} mortality. However, limited data {{are available on the}} long-term follow-up of these patients. The current study was designed to determine long-term survival and morbidity of a large cohort of patients operated on at a single institution. METHODS: From 1975 to 2012, 249 consecutive patients underwent pAVSD repair at the Royal Children’s Hospital. The follow-up data were obtained from hospital records, correspondence with cardiologists and primary care physicians, patient surveys and the state death registry. RESULTS: The early mortality rate was 1. 2 % (3 / 249), while the long-term survival rate was 96 % (95 % CI: 93 – 98 %) at 10 years and 94 % (95 % CI: 89 – 97 %) at 30 years. Freedom from reoperation was 84 % at 10 years and 75 % at 30 years. The most common reoperations were left atrioventricular valve surgery (30 / 249, 12. 1 %), resection of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (12 / 249, 4. 8 %) and closure of residual atrial septal defects (5 / 249, 2. 0 %). Implantation of a permanent pacemaker was required in 3. 2 % (8 / 249) of patients. Despite a substantial reoperation rate, only 43 % of patients older than 18 years of age were seen by a cardiologist within the most recent 2 years of the study period, compared with 80 % of those younger than 18 years (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Repair of pAVSD is performed with a low mortality and excellent long-term survival.
