Pines <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road</b> was once NY135, and its junction with NY134 in Kitchawan was NY135's eastern terminus. From Pines <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road,</b> NY134 bends southward to run alongside a reservoir inlet connecting to Cornell Brook. After about , the route makes a final turn to the east to cross Cornell Brook and reach its east end at an intersection with NY100 (Saw Mill River Road).|$|E

5|$|In 1889 Waterloo Station (renamed from Waterloo Bridge {{station in}} 1886) was {{equipped}} with new signals, which required a gantry spanning all the lines into the station. In return for the LSWR cladding the LNC's entrance on Westminster <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road</b> with white glazed brick, the LNC gave consent for the stanchion supporting the gantry {{to rest on the}} LNC's platform, while reserving the right to demand the gantry be removed. At this time the LSWR also leased a small plot of land west of the Westminster <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road</b> entrance to serve as the site of new offices for the LNC, designed by Cyril Bazett Tubbs.|$|E
5|$|In November 1899, the BS {{announced}} {{a bill for}} the 1900 session. Again, an extension was proposed from Marylebone to Paddington, this time terminating {{to the east of}} the mainline station at the junction of Bishop's Road (now Bishop's <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road)</b> and Gloucester Terrace. A station was planned under Bishop's Road, linked to the mainline station by a subway under Eastbourne Terrace. From Waterloo, an extension was planned to run under Westminster <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road</b> and St George's Road to terminate at Elephant and Castle. The BS would connect there with the C's station as the NC planned two years earlier. A spur was to be provided to a depot and power station that were to be constructed {{on the site of the}} School for the Indigent Blind south of St George's Circus.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} route connecting Laurel and Fort Meade was MD 216. That highway {{was built}} between 1934 and 1939 along a course generally north of modern MD 198. Modern MD 198 was constructed as MD 602 {{as a military}} access project during World War II. The first segment of the new highway, from US 1 to MD 216 near Brock <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road</b> {{in what is now}} Maryland City, was started in 1943 and completed in 1944. This segment included a bridge across the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX) in Laurel and a bridge across the Patuxent River. The remainder of MD 602, from near Brock <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road</b> to the entrance to Fort Meade near the Little Patuxent River, was completed by 1946. When MD 602 was completed, MD 216 was truncated at US 1.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{crossing}} the Smyrna River, DE 9 enters New Castle County and becomes Fleming Landing Road, passing through agricultural areas with some woods {{to the west}} of the Cedar Swamp Wildlife Area. The road runs to the north before curving northwest again. The route turns west onto Taylors <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road</b> and crosses the marshy Blackbird Creek. DE 9 curves to the north-northwest and passes through more rural areas with some residential subdivisions to the west. The route heads to the northwest before turning northeast onto Thomas Corner Road in Mathews Corners, with DE 299 continuing northwest on Taylors <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road</b> towards Odessa, where the Odessa Historic District is located.|$|E
5|$|A {{site for}} the {{replacement}} terminus was bought by the LSWR in 1899, south of the existing site and {{on the opposite side}} of Westminster <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road.</b> It was completed on 8 February 1902, and the LSWR viaduct was widened to serve a greatly enlarged Waterloo station, destroying all traces of the original LNC terminus.|$|E

The march was difficult, {{as some of the}} route ran through thick woods and it was icy, causing horses to slip, and men to break through ice on ponds.|$|E
5|$|NY185 was {{assigned}} on April4, 2008, as a signed replacement for New York State Route910L, an unsigned reference route. It {{is the third}} signed designation that <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road</b> has carried, preceded by New York State Route347 (during the early 1930s) and NY8 (1930s to the 1960s). NY185 originally connected to the Champlain Bridge on its east end; however, that structure was closed and demolished in late 2009. Its replacement opened to traffic in November 2011.|$|E
5|$|NY8 was {{truncated}} {{south to}} Hague , eliminating a lengthy overlap with NY22 and NY9N. Its former routing along <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road</b> became NY903, an unsigned reference route.

5|$|The first {{station was}} a {{temporary}} terminus for the GWR {{on the west}} side of Bishop's <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road,</b> opened on 4 June 1838. The first GWR service from London to Taplow, near Maidenhead, ran from Paddington in 1838. After the main station opened, this became the site of the goods depot. Brunel did not consider that anything less than a grand terminus dedicated to the GWR would be acceptable, and consequently this was approved in February 1853.|$|E
5|$|The new building, also {{designed}} by Cyril Bazett Tubbs, {{was designed for}} attractiveness and modernity to contrast with the traditional gloomy decor associated with the funeral industry. A narrow four-storey office building stood at 188 Westminster <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road.</b> The ground floor was taken up by a large arch leading to a waiting room, an office for general enquiries, and the long driveway leading to the station itself; above this were the LNC's offices and boardrooms.|$|E

The park land was donated to the city in 1911 by Sir Edgar Rennie Bowring on behalf of Bowring Brothers Ltd. on their 100th anniversary of commerce in Newfoundland. The park was officially opened by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught on 15 July 1914.|$|E
5|$|In 1899 the {{location}} of the terminus was blocking the expansion of Waterloo station. After much negotiation, the LSWR reached agreement with the London Necropolis Company, the owners of the cemetery and the railway: in return for the existing site, the LSWR re-equipped the London Necropolis Railway and supplied it with a new station on Westminster <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road.</b> This new building was designed to contrast with other funeral directors' premises by being as attractive as possible. In 1902 the railway moved into the new building, and the earlier station was demolished.|$|E

At Van Cortlandt Park, NY129 becomes residential, passing Croton-Harmon High School as it bends to the northeast. At the junction with Grand Street, NY129 continues northeast on Grand Street, which is a two-lane residential street. The route continues northeast through the village, crossing an intersection with Quaker <b>Bridge</b> <b>Road</b> before becoming a wooded lane in the town of Cortlandt. In Cortlandt, NY129 continues north as Grand Street, paralleling a local creek and entering Croton Dam Plaza.|$|E

50|$|The {{third stage}} of {{construction}} of the bypass was originally projected {{to be completed in}} late 2012, but opened on June 11, 2012 with a ribbon cutting ceremony. With the opening, US 209 was realigned onto the new bypass, US 209 Business was extended from Seven <b>Bridges</b> <b>Road</b> to the new US 209 interchange east of Marshalls Creek and old US 209 along Seven <b>Bridges</b> <b>Road</b> was renumbered to State Route 1019 (SR 1019). Upon opening, Seven <b>Bridges</b> <b>Road</b> will be closed for two to three months for bridge replacement, while the junction with US 209 Business is reconstructed. That portion of the project is slated for completion in early 2013, with a final stage three cost of $18.2 million.|$|R
