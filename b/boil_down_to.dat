25|$|Dennett {{claims that}} {{conventional}} {{explanations of the}} colour change <b>boil</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> either Orwellian or Stalinesque hypotheses, which he says {{are the result of}} Descartes' continued influence on our vision of the mind. In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then goes back and changes that memory in light of subsequent events. This is akin to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, where records of the past are routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This is akin to Joseph Stalin's show trials, where the verdict has been decided in advance and the trial is just a rote presentation.|$|E
25|$|Counterplans: The {{negative}} {{can present}} a counter {{solution to the}} affirmative case's problem {{which may or may}} not go against the resolution. This is generally accompanied by on-case arguments that the counterplan does not solve, as well as disadvantages that link to the affirmative case but not the counterplan. Counterplans narrow down the on-case arguments to: advantages the counterplan can not borrow, the inherency, and the solvency. Upon the negative running a counterplan, most debates <b>boil</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the solvency of the affirmative case, and the disadvantages. Counterplans must be competitive with the plan. This means that the counterplan must either be mutually exclusive with the affirmative (for example, one cannot both increase oil production (a hypothetical plan) and decrease oil production (a hypothetical counterplan) or be undesirable in conjunction with the plan (the negative must win that the inclusion of the plan would cause some form of harm that the counterplan alone would avoid).|$|E

Fogel asserted that part of the problem was Chang's [...] "lack of training as a historian" [...] and another part was [...] "the book's dual aim as passionate polemic and dispassionate history". Fogel also writes: [...] "Dozens of Japanese scholars are now actively engaged in research on every aspect of the war.... Indeed, we know many details of the Nanjing massacre, Japanese sexual exploitation of 'comfort women,' and biological and chemical warfare used in China because of the trailblazing research" [...] of Japanese scholars.|$|E

2500|$|US forces {{sometimes}} employed sophisticated airmobile tactics, using integrated helicopter landings, artillery support, and troop insertions {{to surround}} enemy contacts and close off escape routes. The outstanding mobility {{of the helicopter}} made this possible, and these versatile machines could be sent into action in several configurations (troop transport, gunship, med-evac, heavy lift and supply). Helicopters allowed transport and deployment of infantry, artillery, medical, and supply elements to almost any location, presenting a formidable instrument that enhanced American and ARVN operations. When combined with other aerial elements such as fixed wing air support this combat power was multiplied, and {{opened up a whole}} new dimension of operational maneuver. But helicopters also had several vulnerabilities. They required a vast and expensive [...] "logistical tail" [...] of maintenance, fuel, munitions and bases. No nation except the US could afford such expense- fielding some 12,000 machines in Vietnam, almost half of which were shot down or lost due to accidents. The ability of helicopters to move men and material anywhere was impressive but also meant US and ARVN troops in some instances were heavily dependent on them. Destruction of the helicopter lifeline could derail an operation or maneuver, and the need to air-transport men and material to remote locations meant every new arrival of medevac, supply, transport or troop flights gave the VC/NVA yet another opportunity to cripple missions and machines. Helicopters were also very vulnerable to heavy machine guns, light AA artillery, portable SAMs like the Soviet Strela, and even concentrated small arms fire. According to some historians of airpower (Van Creveld 2011), costs were sometimes not commensurate with gains, and US airmobile operations might <b>boil</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> hugely expensive machines and their support systems chasing a handful of teenagers or second-string militiamen armed with cheap rifles.|$|E
