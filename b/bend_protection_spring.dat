40|$|Research whose {{data has}} been used in this study. This study {{investigated}} willingness to pay for improved water services due to <b>spring</b> <b>protection</b> in Emuhaya District. Semi- structured questionnaires were used to generate qualitative and empirical data on 200 randomly selected respondents using protected and unprotected springs from Emuhaya District of Vihiga County. Contigent valuation method was used for valuation of environmental benefits. Logit model was then adopted to evaluate factors influencing WTP. Findings showed that upto 93 % of respondents were willing to pay inorder to receive satisfactory <b>spring</b> <b>protection</b> services with a mean WTP of Ksh 111. Moreover, the regression results showed that support, membership to group, farm size and time were significant in explaining the variations in the WTP for <b>spring</b> <b>protection.</b> It can be concluded from the study that there was interest among households involved in using springs to participate in the <b>spring</b> <b>protection</b> which implied that they acknowledged importance of water for it is the main natural resource that is vital for improving life. Therefore there was a recommendation on conscious efforts being made to involve the community in the whole planning process of <b>spring</b> <b>protection</b> and cost recovery.

40|$|The {{delineation}} {{of groundwater}} <b>protection</b> zones around <b>springs</b> requires {{the assessment of}} the spring vulnerability, aquifer properties, and preferential infiltration zones in the recharge area. We propose the use of the Vulnerability Estimator for <b>Spring</b> <b>Protection</b> Areas (VESPA) index to quantify spring vulnerability. The VESPA index is based on a joint analysis of discharge, temperature, and electrical conductivity derived from hydrographs. The method requires 1 year of data measured on the spring, and estimates the spring vulnerability for several hydrogeological contexts. No infiltration data in the catchment area is required by the VESPA index. We validated the proposed method using experimental data from 12 test springs, and found that the vulnerability estimated by the VESPA index corresponds to the known vulnerability of the test springs.

40|$|Using a {{randomized}} evaluation in Kenya, we measure health impacts of <b>spring</b> <b>protection,</b> an investment that improves source water quality. We also estimate households' valuation of <b>spring</b> <b>protection</b> and simulate the welfare impacts of {{alternatives to the}} current system of common property rights in water, which limits incentives for private investment. Spring infrastructure investments reduce fecal contamination by 66 %, but household water quality improves less, due to recontamination. Child diarrhea falls by one quarter. Travel-cost based revealed preference estimates of households' valuations are much smaller than both stated preference valuations and health planners' valuations, and are consistent with models in which the demand for health is highly income elastic. We estimate that private property norms would generate little additional investment while imposing large static costs due to above-marginal-cost pricing, private property would function better at higher income levels or under water scarcity, and alternative institutions could yield Pareto improvements.

30|$|In {{terms of}} <b>spring</b> water <b>protection</b> and use, it is {{noted that the}} Ottoman {{management}} mechanisms are still in use today. Ottoman era focused on spring water quality from a societal and religious angle and used it as a rule for water quality <b>protection.</b> The <b>springs</b> have never been regarded as state property but, rather, their ownership was given to the families owning the land where the spring originated from. Thus, it fell on the members of the community to maintain the quality and protection of these water resources. The lack of proper water quality preservation regulations could be explained by the limited water resources at that time where the Ottoman regime itself was dependent on springs as the only water sources available. Accordingly, the efforts were focused on the spring's cleanness and sustainability.|$|R

40|$|In many societies, {{social norms}} create common {{property}} rights in natural resources, limiting incentives for private investment. This paper uses a randomized evaluation in Kenya {{to measure the}} health impacts of investments to improve source water quality through <b>spring</b> <b>protection,</b> estimate the value that households place on <b>spring</b> <b>protection,</b> and simulate the welfare impacts of alternative water property rights norms and institutions, including common property, freehold private property, and alternative “Lockean” property rights norms. We find that infrastructure investments reduce fecal contamination by 66 % at naturally occurring springs, cutting child diarrhea by one quarter. While households increase their use of protected springs, travel-cost based revealed preference estimates of households’ valuations are only one-half stated preference valuations and are much smaller than levels implied by health planners’ typical valuations of child mortality, consistent with models in which the demand for health is highly income elastic. Simulations suggest that, at current income levels, private property norms would generate little additional investment while imposing large static costs due to spring owners’ local market power, but that private property norms might function better than common property at higher income levels. Alternative institutions, such as “modified Lockean” property rights, government investment or vouchers for improved water, could yield higher social welfare. ...|$|R

40|$|During {{the present}} year one more {{instance}} {{has been added}} to a list already considerable and honorable, of disputes successfully settled by special arbitration on the part of Great Britain and the United States. The award of the commission, to which the settlement of five questions relating to the sealing controversy was referred, was made in August. It may be of interest to attempt very briefly to state what was and what was not decided by this award, and to characterize the policy of our government and the arguments of our counsel in view of it. The facts agreed upon between the parties were that the fur seal was largely diminished in numbers and seemed threatened with extinction. But there existed an irreconcilable difference of opinion as to the cause of this, the experts of the United States, most of them, holding that pelagic slaughter was accountable for it, while those of Great Britain maintained that these unhappy results sprang from the unscientific methods of killing on the Pribilof Islands, practiced by the licensees. The question at issue was this: Has the United States acquired, either through an exclusive jurisdiction over the waters of Bering Sea or through a property right in seals breeding there, the right to protect them in the open sea by force, or must such <b>protection</b> <b>spring</b> from the joint action of the two governments? And if the latter is true, what regulations are necessary to accomplish the purpose? The fact that Great Britain was willing to join in the reference of this latter question, is an important one. It indicated clearly, what she had maintained throughout, though not always with sufficient energy to overcome the hampering influences of the British colonies on this continent, that she desired to preserve the seals from threatened extinction, that the real question was one of method, but that she objected to the assertion of exclusive right in the matter by the United States. This fact should be taken as the key to her policy. It certainly made the task of our government simpler and, as may appear later, its second policy of doubtful expediency...|$|R
