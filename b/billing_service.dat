40|$|Since its introduction, Android’s in-app <b>billing</b> <b>service</b> has quickly gained popularity. The in-app <b>billing</b> <b>service</b> {{allows users}} to pay for options, services, subscriptions, and virtual goods from within mobile apps themselves. In-app billing is {{attractive}} for developers because {{it is easy to}} integrate, and has the advantage that the devel-oper {{does not need to be}} concerned with managing financial trans-actions. In this paper, we present the first fully-automated attack against the in-app <b>billing</b> <b>service</b> on Android. Using our prototype, we conducted a robustness study against our attack, analyzing 85 of the most popular Android apps that make use of in-app billing. We found that 60 % of these apps were easily and automatically crack-able. We were able to bypass highly popular and prominent games such as Angry Birds and Temple Run, each of which have millions of users. Based on our study, we developed a defensive technique that specifically counters automated attacks against in-app billing. Our technique is lightweight and can be easily added to existing applications...|$|E

The approach proposed in this paper provides a support for cooperation between services. Our proposition is useful for service architectures that evolve and grow in size constantly. The number of services increases and even services are changing to offer new alternatives. The aim is to provide a flexible way to partially automate the processing of ontology and related mapping evolution management. A case study in Telecom service cooperation illustrates the benefits of our approach.
