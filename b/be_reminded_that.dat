25|$|Benedict XV {{recalled}} the great Apostles of the Gospel who contributed {{much to the}} expansion of missions. He reviewed the recent history of the missions and stated so as the purpose of the apostolic letter. The encyclical first turned to the bishops and superiors in charge of the Catholic missions, noting the need to train local clergy. Catholic missionaries today continue to <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> their goal is a spiritual one which must be carried out in a selfless way.|$|E
25|$|When the 1970 Roman Missal allowed laypeople {{to receive}} both species {{of bread and}} wine, it insisted that priests should use the {{occasion}} to teach the faithful the Catholic doctrine on the form of Communion, as affirmed by the Council of Trent: they were first to <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> they receive the whole Christ when they participate in the sacrament even under one kind alone, and thus are not then deprived of any grace necessary for salvation. The circumstances in which this was permitted were initially very restricted, but were gradually extended. Regular distribution of Communion under both kinds requires {{the permission of the}} bishop, but bishops in some countries have given blanket permission for the administration of Communion in this way.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} half of the Victorian era, there was a more or less {{negative}} view of women's styles of the 1795–1820 period. Some people would have felt slightly uncomfortable to <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> their mothers or grandmothers had once promenaded about in such styles (which could be considered indecent according to Victorian norms), and many would have found it somewhat difficult to really empathize with (or take seriously) the struggles of a heroine of art or literature if they were being constantly reminded that she was wearing such clothes. For such reasons, some Victorian history paintings of the Napoleonic wars intentionally avoided depicting accurate women's styles (see example below), Thackeray's illustrations to his book Vanity Fair depicted the women of the 1810s wearing 1840s fashions, and in Charlotte Brontë's 1849 novel Shirley (set in 1811–1812) neo-Grecian fashions are anachronistically relocated to an earlier generation.|$|E

25|$|The Act {{allowed the}} commissioners to lease the tolls for periods {{of up to}} seven years, and the first lease was granted to Charles Chaplin, one of the commissioners who held ten shares, in January 1770. He agreed to pay a rent of 4 per cent per year to the other shareholders, and to {{contribute}} a maximum of £500 per year towards maintenance costs. If more than £500 was needed, the commissioners were to supply any additional amounts. Although Chaplin had an option to renew the lease after 7 years, {{he did not do}} so, and no other takers could be found. The commissioners then negotiated with Chaplin, and revised terms were agreed. In return for a 99-year lease, he would fund all repairs, pay the salaries of the officers of the canal, and pay 5 per cent interest to the subscribers. Clearly, the 99-year lease was not authorised by the enabling Act, but nobody challenged its legality for over 50 years. Chaplin was not thorough in carrying out his side of the bargain and had to <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> he had not been paying the interest in 1782 and again in 1788.|$|E
500|$|At {{the opening}} of Johor's 12th State Assembly in June 2008, Sultan Iskandar of Johor pledged to reclaim the island [...] "whatever it takes". Speaking impromptu {{at the end of}} a {{prepared}} speech, the Sultan said in Malay: [...] "Let us <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> I do not forget Pulau Batu Puteh. Pulau Batu Puteh is not Singapore's, but it belongs to Johor. It does not matter how long it may take, I will find the way to get back the island, which belongs to Johor." [...] The Menteri Besar of Johor said the state government had [...] "clearly heard" [...] what the Sultan said, but did not elaborate.|$|E
500|$|Music was a {{major part}} of {{everyday}} life. [...] The word itself derives from Greek μουσική (mousike), [...] "(art) of the Muses". Many private and public events were accompanied by music, ranging from nightly dining to military parades and manoeuvres. In a discussion of any ancient music, however, non-specialists and even many musicians have to <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> much of what makes our modern music familiar to us is the result of developments only within the last 1,000 years; thus, our ideas of melody, scales, harmony, and even the instruments we use may not have been familiar to Romans who made and listened to music many centuries earlier.|$|E

500|$|After 10...d6! White can try (and has tried) {{about any}} move that {{supports}} the aforementioned plan. In particular, White has to choose {{if he wants to}} start active operations on the queenside immediately (e.g. Rc1, Qc3, c5), or if he wants to finish his development first (with Be2 and 0-0). The immediate 11.c5!? is a possible pawn sacrifice in order to open some diagonals for the bishops. As Lalic points out, [...] "after 11...dxc5 Black's knight on e5 has lost its support and therefore all tactical motifs based on Qd5 and Bb5+ must be carefully checked". White gets a powerful attack for his pawn but nothing decisive. The same idea can be tried with the preparatory 11.Rc1, and after 11...0-0 12.c5!? dxc5 13.Qd5 Ng6 14.Bg3 White should <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> he has not finished his development with 14...Qf6! and a counter-attack on the b2-pawn. Playing Black, Svidler chose a different path with 11...b6 but his opponent Lesiège nevertheless sacrificed the pawn with 12.c5! bxc5 13.b4 0-0 14.bxc5 Bb7 15.f3 and Svilder chose to destroy his own pawn structure with 15...dxc5!? to activate his pieces and make use of the d-file. The most popular move is 11.Be2, where White delays his queenside play until he has achieved castling. It also gives Black more time to organise a defence on the queenside with b7–b6, either now or after 11...0-0.|$|E
500|$|Peter Gaston of Spin {{wrote that}} the video for [...] "Hard" [...] resembles [...] "Janet Jackson's 'Rhythm Nation' meets Christina Aguilera's 'Dirrty' phase—Rihanna vamps in dimly lit outposts, dodges explosions in the desert, and, quite enticingly, takes a break from boot camp to smother herself with mud. Morale-boosting, indeed!" [...] James Dinh of MTV News showed the video, on a small player, to fans in Times Square in New York City to ask their opinions. Most said she looked [...] "sexy" [...] in the video, and {{agreed that it was}} {{different}} from previous videos and shows where she came from and where she is going in her personal life. Bill Lamb of About.com wrote, [...] "I must confess that I do fail to understand the point of Rihanna humping the gun turret of a pink tank dressed in Mickey Mouse ears. It seems pains were taken to make the setting look like Afghanistan or Iraq with the other actors looking as close to real military personnel as possible." [...] Lamb criticized the video's lack of sensitivity and respect for using an army and weapons of destruction to glamorize war, saying, [...] "Does Def Jam, Rihanna's label, need to <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> this comes on the heels of sadly sending off an additional 30,000 troops from our country to real war? In my mind {{this is one of the}} most tasteless, offensive moves by a major pop artist in recent memory." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Bender's {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt at}} godhood, he encounters a god-like entity in space. Bender first {{wonders if the}} entity is God, because of its awesome power or a computer because it thinks in binary. The entity responds [...] "Possible, I do feel compassion towards all living things" [...] and [...] "Possible, I am user-friendly" [...] respectively, adding [...] "My good chum" [...] to the end both times. Bender eventually theorizes that the entity may have, in fact, been {{the remains of a}} satellite that collided with God, to which the entity replies [...] "Probable". The conversation between them touches on the ideas of predestination, prayer, and the nature of salvation, in what Mark Pinsky referred to as a theological turn to the episode which may cause the viewer to need [...] "to <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> this is a cartoon and not a divinity school class". By the end of the conversation, Bender's questions still have not been fully answered, and he is left wanting more from the voice than it has given him. The character/entity returned, albeit briefly, in the first of the direct-to-DVD installments, Bender's Big Score.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{mutually}} contradictory explanations {{have been}} put forward that rely on psychosomatic effects. On the one hand, a birthday provides a fixed date to focus on, allowing the terminally ill to hold on until the day itself. On the other hand, a birthday also reminds the individual of mortality and offers an occasion {{to look back on}} life. According to the terror management theory, this causes stress which can accelerate death. The uneven mortality rate distribution between men and women, and between more and less successful baseball players, suggests that both {{may play a role in}} the birthday effect: people who have focused on the public sphere of life (for example, career-driven people or professional athletes) might <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> their glory days have passed, while those who lived more in the private sphere (such as stay-at-home parents and amateur sports players) are more aware of what they will lose in death and try to hold on. Related is the [...] "broken promise effect", whereby a person suffering suicidal ideation will wait until a birthday or other significant event to see whether their circumstances will improve.|$|E

2500|$|The Times commented, [...] "there is another, sweeter side to her travails. [...] Miranda loves singing and, despite – {{or perhaps}} because of – the satire, becomes an {{evocation}} of something all humans love to do and have done since before we discovered language. The very act of singing, however dire the sound, makes us feel good." [...] Ballinger noted that the TV show Glee (to which Miranda submitted an [...] "audition" [...] in 2010) is causing a resurgence of interest in singing in schools: [...] "Everyone is talking about Glee and choirs and musical theatre, igniting a flame that has been dimmed for a long time. ... Live performance and musical theatre were almost a lost art ... people need to <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>that</b> it takes a lot more effort to sing than just watching movies or TV shows." [...] Miranda followed up on this idea, saying: [...] "Since I became so famous ... everyone is watching more music and singing more – because everyone wants to be more like me." [...] As the Miranda character matured, its popularity grew especially with younger audiences of the Glee generation, with most of those attending her concerts being teenagers or in their twenties. Ballinger says that she gets the most satisfaction from her live performances.|$|E
