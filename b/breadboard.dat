5|$|Because {{of their}} size, shape, and {{well-defined}} chemical structures, viruses {{have been used}} as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale. Recent examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., using Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles to amplify signals in DNA microarray based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent dimers that act as quenchers. Another example is the use of CPMV as a nanoscale <b>breadboard</b> for molecular electronics.|$|E
5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another <b>breadboard</b> {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E
25|$|The first {{mention of}} radar in the UK was a 1930 {{suggestion}} made by W. A. S. Butement and P. E. Pollard of the Army War Office's Signals Experimental Establishment (SEE). They proposed building a radar system for detecting ships {{to be used}} with shore batteries, and went so far to build a low-power <b>breadboard</b> prototype using pulses at 50cm wavelength (600MHz). The War Office was uninterested and did not provide funding for further development. The matter was mentioned in passing in the January 1931 issue of the Inventions Book of the Royal Engineers.|$|E

50|$|Veroboard {{is similar}} in concept and usage to plug-in <b>breadboard,</b> but is cheaper and more {{permanent}} - connections are soldered and while some limited reuse may be possible, {{more than a few}} cycles of soldering and desoldering are likely to render both the components and the board unusable. In contrast, <b>breadboard</b> connections are held by friction, and the <b>breadboard</b> can be reused many times. However, a <b>breadboard</b> is not very suitable for prototyping that needs to remain in a set configuration for an appreciable period of time nor for physical mock-ups containing a working circuit or for any environment subject to vibration or movement.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{relatively}} large parasitic {{capacitance compared to}} a properly laid out PCB (approx 2pF between adjacent contact columns), high inductance of some connections and a relatively high and not very reproducible contact resistance, solderless <b>breadboards</b> are limited to operation at relatively low frequencies, usually less than 10 MHz, depending {{on the nature of}} the circuit. The relatively high contact resistance can already be a problem for some DC and very low frequency circuits. Solderless <b>breadboards</b> are further limited by their voltage and current ratings.|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the ESA funded project EAP (Electro Active Polymers) an international team of universities and companies led by Kayser Italia Srl has studied and developed applications of EAP to investigate the possibility to monitor and control inflatable and deployable lightweight space structures. Different configurations of EAP have been studied and developed aiming at damping the vibrations of a long inflated-rigidized boom and at the shaping of reflector like structures. Novel configurations of electro-active polymers have been designed and manufactured with the aim of testing their capabilities on <b>breadboards</b> which are representative of space structures. The work on the development and characterization of the EAP configurations is presented first along with experimental data and simulations run with models purposely developed.
