The ModBot finger is a 3 degree of freedom finger that has the capabilities to process force and touch sensation at and along the tip of the finger while retaining all capable movement and degrees of freedom achieved by a human finger. Every piece of the ModBot finger has evolved many times in order to shed weight, lower inertia and achieve a <b>backdrivable</b> system. To achieve a true <b>backdrivable</b> system gears could not be used, due to the backlash, friction had to be reduced to its smallest value, weight was optimized for a high strength to weight ratio and part shapes were carefully engineered to achieve a low inertia, all of this allows for a smooth operating joint.

The focus of this thesis {{is to develop a}} planar biped robot with <b>backdrivable</b> joints so that any mismatch in trajectories and the environment leading to impact can be absorbed without losing stability. For this purpose, we first start with static walking gait co-simulation with Working Model- 2 D and MATLAB. The walk cycle is divided into 12 number of steps. A smooth trajectory is calculated. MATLAB calculates the joint angles at each time step and Working Model 2 D executes that joint angles in the simulation. Later a simple 7 link biped model is considered for the simulation and then made it to walk on ground by applying torques at hip and stance leg ankle. The walking simulations are done in MATLAB. Forward dynamic analysis is used to get the simulation. Torque is applied stance leg ankle, hip and the desired motion is generated. Ground reaction forces are calculated at front and rear leg.

The Mechanized Gait Trainer and the LOKOMAT are two robotic devices {{that have been developed}} to improve gait rehabilitation, but neither provides the facilitation of pelvis movements afforded by traditional methods. In addition, neither device is truly <b>backdrivable.</b> As shown by Hogan and Krebs, <b>backdrivable,</b> impedance-controlled robots are ideal for rehabilitation because of their stable interaction properties. Robots for the arm/shoulder, wrist, ankle, and hand have already been developed. This thesis describes the design of a robot for gait rehabilitation through the facilitation of pelvis movements. Four degrees of freedom (DOF) are actuated: vertical, lateral, and frontal translations as well as the rotation about the vertical axis. Vertical forces support part of the patient's weight. Lateral forces assist the weight shift from stance leg to swing leg and are a part of physiotherapy and treadmill training. (cont.) Frontal forces help pace the subject as on a treadmill. Pelvic rotations can impart energy into the swing leg without direct actuation of the hip and knee muscles. A four DOF mechanism was designed to control these movements, consisting of a three-DOF planar linkage with a vertical prismatic translation. A mockup of the configuration was designed and tested to show that the non-actuated pelvis DOFs are not adversely affected by the device. Design calculations include finding the optimal linkage configuration, selecting ballspline shafts for the vertical DOF, selecting actuators, and designing the robot arm cross-sections and joints.

The ease with which an amputee interprets these haptic cues, however, likely depends on whether their dynamic signal behavior corresponds to expected behaviors—behaviors consonant with a natural limb coupled to the environment. A highly geared motor in a terminal device along with the associated high back-drive impedance influences dynamic interactions with the environment, creating effects not encountered with a natural limb. Here we explore grasp and lift performance with a <b>backdrivable</b> (low backdrive impedance) terminal device placed under proportional myoelectric position control that features referred haptic feedback. Methods We fabricated a back-drivable terminal device {{that could be used}} by amputees and non-amputees alike and drove aperture (or grip force, when a stiff object was in its grasp) in proportion to a myoelectric signal drawn from a single muscle site in the forearm. In randomly ordered trials, we assessed the performance of N= 10 participants (7 non-amputee, 3 amputee) attempting to grasp and lift an object using the terminal device under three feedback conditions (no feedback, vibrotactile feedback, and joint torque feedback), and two object weights that were indiscernible by vision. Results Both non-amputee and amputee participants scaled their grip force according to the object weight. Our results showed only minor differences in grip force, grip/load force coordination, and slip as a function of sensory feedback condition, though the grip force at the point of lift-off for the heavier object was significantly greater for amputee participants in the presence of joint torque feedback.

40|$|Integrating an {{exoskeleton}} as {{the external}} apparatus for a brain-machine interface {{has the advantage}} of providing multiple contact points to determine body segment postures and allowing control to and feedback from each joint. Most current brain-machine interface studies use non-human primates, for example rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), as the research subjects. In order to develop an upper limb exoskeleton for macaques which can provide both data acquisition and motion actuation, this dissertation investigates the mechatronic considerations of developing such a device, including 1) the kinematic modeling and structural design, and 2) the actuator design and control. An exoskeleton is a wearable robot, and is supposed to be attached to the user's body segments. Thus the kinematic structure needs to match the macaque's upper limb as closely as possible, which requires the exoskeleton to be compact and singularity free in workspace, as well as have biomorphic nature joints and firm attachments. In order to provide sufficient output torque and guarantee the user's safety, the actuators of the exoskeleton should be <b>backdrivable,</b> of high power-to-weight ratio, and capable of executing compliant actuation algorithms. Based on the above design requirements, this dissertation presents the development process of an upper limb exoskeleton for macaques from kinematic modeling and analysis, passive exoskeleton prototyping and animal training, compliant actuator design and control, to completion of an actuated exoskeleton and system integration with a brain-machine interface. First an upper limb exoskeleton model is proposed with a redundant shoulder joint to achieve improved manipulability than conventional designs. The advantageous features of the proposed exoskeleton model are demonstrated by a series of kinematic analysis. Then a passive upper limb exoskeleton is fabricated for kinematic model validation, motion characterization and animal training purposes, and its effectiveness is demonstrated by the animal tests. In order to obtain a compact, powerful, <b>backdrivable</b> and torque-reflecting actuator for the actuated exoskeleton, a cable-driven series elastic actuator is designed, and an interactive impedance control algorithm is proposed and experimentally validated.

It suggests that decreasing ankle impedance with muscle fatigue may contribute to an increased probability of ankle injury.

Median frequencies of surface electromyographic (EMG) signals collected from tibialis and triceps surae muscle groups were evaluated to assess muscle fatigue. Using a standard multi-input and multi-output stochastic impedance identification method, multivariable ankle mechanical impedance was measured in two degrees of freedom under muscle fatigue. Results indicate that ankle mechanical impedance decreases in both the dorsi-plantarflexion and inversion-eversion directions under tibialis muscle fatigue. However, the effect of triceps surae on ankle mechanical impedance is uncertain since the current experimental protocol could not effectively induce fatigue in triceps surae. by Shuo Wang. Thesis (S.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of safe human [...] robot {{physical}} interaction, this paper introduces a new method {{for the detection of}} dynamic impacts of flexible-joint robot manipulators with their environment. The objective is to detect external impacts applied to the robot using only proprioceptive information with maximal sensitivity. Several model-based detection methods in robotics are based on the difference, called residual, between the estimated and the actual applied torques. Sensitivity of such methods can be limited by model uncertainties that originate either from errors on experimentally identified model parameters, possibly varying with the operating conditions, or the use of simplified models, which results in a residual dependence on the robot's state. The main contribution of this paper consists of a new adaptive residual evaluation method that takes into account this dependence, which otherwise can lead to a tradeoff between sensitivity and false alarm rate. The proposed approach uses only proprioceptive motor-side measurements and does not require any additional joint position sensors or force/torque sensors. Dynamic effects of a collision on the residual are isolated using bandpass filtering and comparison with a state-dependent dynamic threshold. Adaptive online estimation of filter coefficients avoids the need for extensive experiments for parametric model identification.

With applications in rehabilitation medicine and virtual reality simulation, exoskeletons offer benefits for both disabled and healthy populations. A pilot database defining the kinematics and dynamics of the upper limb during daily living activities was one among several factors guiding the development of an anthropomorphic, 7 -DOF, powered arm exoskeleton. Additional design inputs include anatomical and physiological considerations, workspace analyses, and upper limb joint ranges of motion. The database was compiled from 19 arm activities of daily living. The cable-actuated dexterous exoskeleton for neurorehabilitation (CADEN) - 7 offers remarkable opportunities as a versatile human–machine interface and as a new generation of assistive technology. Proximal placement of motors and distal placement of cable-pulley reductions were incorporated into the design, leading to low inertia, highstiffness links, and <b>backdrivable</b> transmissions with zero backlash. The design enables full glenohumeral, elbow, and wrist joint functionality. Potential applications of the exoskeleton as a wearable robot include: 1) a therapeutic and diagnostics device for physiotherapy, 2) an assistive (orthotic) device for human power amplifications, 3) a haptic device in virtual reality simulation, and 4) a master device for teleoperation.

The large diversity of tasks to carry out, the unstructured environments and the close interaction with humans call for collaborative robots to seamlessly adapt their behaviors so as to cooperate with the users successfully under different and possibly new situations (characterized, for example, by positions of objects/landmarks in the environment, or by the user pose). This paper investigates how controllers capable of reactive and proactive behaviors in collaborative tasks can be learned from demonstrations. The proposed approach exploits the temporal coherence and dynamic characteristics of the task observed during the training phase to build a probabilistic model that enables the robot to both react to the user actions and lead the task when needed.

It introduced a new modality of therapy, offering a highly <b>backdrivable</b> experience with a soft and stable feel for the user. MIT-MANUS proved an excellent fit for shoulder and elbow rehabilitation in stroke patients, showing a reduction of impairment in clinical trials with well over 300 stroke patients. The greatest impairment reduction was observed {{in the group of}} muscles exercised. This suggests a need for additional robots to rehabilitate other target areas of the body. Previous work has expanded the planar MIT-MANUS to include an antigravity robot for shoulder and elbow, and a wrist robot. In this paper we present the "missing link": A hand robot. It consists of a single-degree-of-freedom (DOF) mechanism in a novel statorless configuration, which enables rehabilitation of grasping. The system uses the kinematic configuration of a double crank and slider where the members are linked to stator and rotor; a free base motor, i. e., a motor having two rotors that are free to rotate instead of a fixed stator and a single rotatable rotor (dual-rotor statorless motor). A cylindrical structure, made of six panels and driven by the relative rotation of the rotors, is able to increase its radius linearly, moving or guiding the hand of the patients during grasping. This module completes our development of robots for the upper extremity, yielding {{for the first time a}} whole-arm rehabilitation experience. In this paper, we will discuss in detail the design and characterization of the device. © 2007 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|Human {{motor control}} pathologies, {{such as those}} caused by stroke, can be treated through {{physical}} rehabilitation. The use of robots in therapy environments seems appropriate considering the possibilities they offer for quantification of performance as well as "quality control" between therapy sessions. The research presented in this thesis {{is part of the}} continuing development of robotic applications for physical therapy and neuro-rehabilitation at the Newman Laboratory for Biomechanics and Human Rehabilitation. MIT-MANUS, a robot for shoulder and elbow therapy developed in this lab, introduced this new brand of therapy, offering a highly <b>backdrivable</b> mechanism with a soft and stable feel for the user. The focus here is the development, characterization, and implementation of a robot for wrist rehabilitation, designed to provide three rotational degrees of freedom. The wrist motions of flexion/extension and abduction/adduction are governed by a differential gear mechanism, while pronation and supination of the forearm are actuated by a curved slider attached {{to the rest of the}} mechanism. Through the characterization, the device was found to exhibit some unwanted behavior, largely attributable to the nonlinearities inherent in the system. Efforts to suppress these effects through control are presented along with recommendations for addressing these problems at the design level. (cont.) The alpha prototype has been set up for clinical trials by providing a functional control scheme along with "video game" patient interfaces; initial clinical trials will run in parallel with the development of the next version of the device. If improvements comparable to those seen with the use of MIT-MANUS are seen with the wrist robot, then rehabilitation therapists will have a new and useful tool at their disposal. by James R.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a telerobotic master device consisting of a 7 -axis <b>backdrivable</b> robotic arm, and a pressure-sensitive grip-controller integrated with a Compact Remote Console (CRC), thus creating a highly functional teleoperation station targeted to control a 6 -axis industrial robotic arm and dexterous robotic hand to be used for demolition work in a nuclear setting. We successfully completed the development of one of the world?s smallest brushless motor controllers due partially to funding through this grant. These controllers are used to drive the motors in the master robotic arm. We also completed the development of an improved model of a highly advanced 4 degree-of-freedom arm ? this same arm is the core component in the teleoperation system. The WAM arm and a 3 -axis gimbals were integrated with a commercially available CRC at our consultant?s lab at University of Tennessee. Additional support hardware and software were combined to tie the master control system to an existing industrial robot in the lab. A master controller for a dexterous hand was developed and became {{an integral part of the}} gimbals handle. Control algorithms were developed and the software was written and implemented. The entire system was then debugged and tested. Results of the prototype system are promising. The WAM Arm, gimbals, hand controller and CRC were successful integrated. Testing of the system to control the 6 -axis industrial arm and prototype dexterous hand showed great potential. Relatively simple tasks were successfully performed at slow speeds. Some of the testing was hampered by problems with the slave dexterous hand. This is a prototype hand being developed by Barrett under a different Phase II program. Potential improvements and advancements to the system include improving the control code, and integration of a 2 nd master controller arm in order to drive a 2 nd slave arm and hand. In summary, the device is a complex system with advanced features and could be used as a universal platform for efficient controlling of robotic arms performing remote tasks in unstructured and uncertain environments such as those prevalent in environmental clean up...|$|E
