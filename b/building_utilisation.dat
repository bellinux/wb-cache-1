40|$|Public {{buildings}} and large infrastructure are typically monitored by tens {{or hundreds of}} cameras, all capturing different physical spaces and observing different types of interactions and behaviours. However to date, in large part due to limited data availability, crowd monitoring and operational surveillance {{research has focused on}} single camera scenarios which are not representative of real-world applications. In this paper we present a new, publicly available database for large scale crowd surveillance. Footage from 12 cameras for a full work day covering the main floor of a busy university campus building, including an internal and external foyer, elevator foyers, and the main external approach are provided; alongside annotation for crowd counting (single or multi-camera) and pedestrian flow analysis for 10 and 6 sites respectively. We describe how this large dataset can be used to perform distributed monitoring of <b>building</b> <b>utilisation,</b> and demonstrate the potential of this dataset to understand and learn the relationship between different areas of a building...|$|E

It is also freely available at the ICONDA®CIBlibrary: [URL] government Policy Planning Guidance promotes optimum use of the existing building stock through mixed use in urban centres and encourages conversion of redundant office and retail space into leisure, service or residential uses. Whilst social pressures {{are evident in the}} push to more effectively utilise existing building stock, new building stock also has to meet the commercial requirements of the client, which often translates into maximum occupancy of the building. This is encouraging greater innovation in the design of new buildings to allow change of use throughout the structure’s lifetime. This paper describes the concepts surrounding an adaptable design for new buildings, along with a review of factors influencing the mode of use. The major physical parameters of storey height, building proximity, plan depth, structural design, services, fire safety, cladding and noise abatement are evaluated in the context of adaptable building use. In addition to improved <b>building</b> <b>utilisation,</b> the UK government has identified a weakness in the productivity of the construction industry.

40|$|Green {{building}} (GB) {{is one of}} {{the most}} effective solutions to increase the efficiency of <b>buildings</b> through resource <b>utilisation</b> and recycling, mitigating the negative impact of the construction industry on the environment. As a construction innovation, GB has faced numerous challenges to its penetration into a market crowded with conventional buildings. Studies of GB barriers have been conducted around the world, including the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia, but they are scarce in Vietnam and limited to individual perspectives. This paper identifies 41 barriers to GB in Vietnam from the literature and validates them by a survey of 215 construction professionals and government officers. Principal Component Analysis in Exploratory Factor Analysis is used to reveal that, while legislative and institutional barriers are widely perceived as the most challenging obstacles, social and cognitive barriers as a whole represent the main hindrances involved. Final remarks include policy recommendations for GB adoption in Vietnam and suggestions for further research...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of passive or active solar system {{applications}} is not only high efficient collecting and storing of solar energy but effective distribution the heat around the building spaces as well. The main goal of this work is to analyse and compare two types of solar air collector integrated in an ecological, low-energy, one family building. The first one, is a large volume sunspace located on the south-west {{of the building and}} the second, is a small volume and flat solar panel on the roof. Both collectors are connected with particular rooms by a ventilation system. The components of this system include air flow gaps for natural ventilation and various devices for mechanical ventilation. Some components are controlled {{on the basis of the}} zone¿s air temperature. Numerical analyses have been conducted for selected two-week periods using hourly Polish weather data. The results show that during the selected, coldest winter period, the air temperature inside the collectors does not exceed 20 °C and there is no additional heat flow from the collectors to the rooms. Effective heat gains appear just from March to the end of the heating period. During this period, an additional fan is on and excess energy is transferred to the rooms not only by conduction but by convection as well. The presented results illustrate the differences in heating energy demand and thermal performance of the <b>building.</b> The <b>utilisation</b> of solar energy can reduce heating energy demand and decrease the number of heating hours. Finally the efficiency coefficient of the system was estimated as a function between solar energy gains and heating energy requirements...|$|R
40|$|Tropical climates are {{thermally}} {{uncomfortable and}} are mostly unhealthy to {{the occupants of}} the modern skyscrapers both residential and commercial buildings. The outdoor of air dry bulb temperatures are on the hot side coupled with high relative humidity's. The population living in the tropics, especially in countries like Malaysia, is affluent and can afford to air condition their residences and offices. Installation of air-conditioners is almost synonymous with prestige. This way of living leads to increased electricity usage and energy consumption in the buildings. However, switching- off the air-conditioning {{is not an option}} for the modern day buildings, as it would affect the health of the people as well as their productivity. This paper proposes innovative indoor units that will contribute to energy conservation by utilising principles of partial air-conditioning. The outdoor units can be utilised for clothes drying or for providing hot water to the occupants of the building of residential buildings thus, reducing the energy requirements in the <b>buildings.</b> Thus, the <b>utilisation</b> of partial air-conditioning will lead to enormous savings in energy consumption in the buildings...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} currently pursued in planning sustainable urban environments is the reduction of energy consumption. Strategies for energy and the built environment are given in UK planning policies. Yet the application of such strategies at a local scale requires careful contextual analysis, since local conditions may inhibit, or enhance, benefits that these strategies intend to deliver. More importantly, the permanence of such benefits over time can be disrupted if local conditions are undermined by unpredicted future events. This paper analyses the application of three energy conservation strategies recommended in planning guidance developed by Lancaster City Council for a flagship regeneration project. The strategies are energy-efficient <b>building</b> envelopes, the <b>utilisation</b> of passive solar design principles and the generation of renewable energy. Results from the analysis suggest that {{each one of these}} solutions could be vulnerable to unpredicted future events and that conditions to improve their resilience need to be built in today. The appraisal elicits interdependencies between solutions for energy efficiency and other sustainability solutions such as the quality of the public realm, the local microclimate, air quality and more. The discussion of these links leads to a series of recommendations designed to inform planning guidance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{measurement}} of heat flows {{in the engineering}} field is relevant to thermophysical characteristics of materials {{in the study of}} the behaviour of a wall or the achievement of an energy balance in a <b>building.</b> Nevertheless, the <b>utilisation</b> of heat flowmeters in a thermal circuit has to be accompanied by some precautions, notably for materials which are slightly heat conducting. The perturbation induced by the presence of the heat flowmeter is in fact often difficult to evaluate. An analysis method is proposed that allows the definition of optimum conditions of use of two sensor types in the case of conductive exchanges. This analysis is based on a simplified model considering the heat flowmeter as a resistive and capacitive thermal layer placed in series in the studied system. The modelling of these perturbations demonstrates three influential factors: the type of heat flowmeter, the ratio of the temperature of the surface of the studied system to the outgoing heat flow, and the time scale characterising the studied phenomena. An example of the use of heat flowmeters to measure the thermal effusivity of building materials and the {{measurement of}} the heat flow inside walls of building is presented. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims at {{developing}} a {{decision support system}} for pallet utilisation in the sheet feeder industry. Furthermore, the research project has focused on providing an improvement to {{the current system of}} distribution of the customer order onto pallets. The overall research objectives are to: (i) Establish {{the state of the art}} in areas related to the project; (ii) Identify the key variables such as pallet sizes, truck sizes, material features and customers’ requirements for <b>building</b> the pallet <b>utilisation</b> model; (iii) Develop an analytical approach and a prototype system to improve the utilisation of the pallets and the truck volume; (iv) Validate the developed model and prototype system through real-life case studies and expert opinions. A combination of research methodology approaches has been employed in this research study. Firstly, a familiarisation stage has been conducted through comprehensive literature review and visits to the sponsoring company. The second phase was to conduct semi-structured interviews with the shop-floor operators and operations directors to have a better understanding of the business needs. This was combined with measurements of the trucks and the pallets and internal documentation from the company. In this stage, the researcher also distributed questionnaires to other sheet feeder companies to know if the system could be applied also to more companies. In the third phase, the data gathered were analysed for the subsequent development of the system. Then the system has been developed following the logic rules obtained by analysing the data. Finally, the developed model and system has been validated, through real-life case studies and expert opinions. The developed analytical model has been implemented in a prototype system. The developed system comprises a knowledge-based system, material handling modules, databases and user interface. The developed system for pallet utilisation encompasses pallet database, truck database and material features databases. The developed model and system has the capability to estimate the number of corrugated cardboard sheets that should be loaded per pallet. Additionally the system predicts the number of sheets per stack and the type of pallet that should be used. The system provides the shop-floor operators with an effective tool for pallet utilisation in order to reduce their decision time. Therefore, the developed system provides cost and time savings in terms of improvements of the pallet and vehicle volume utilisation for the preparation and delivery of the corrugated board product. This system has given to the sponsoring company an improvement of 5 % in the way of orders’ management...|$|R
40|$|A Dissertation {{presented}} {{for the final}} examination in MScitecture of University of MoratuwaEnergy {{is one of the}} most vital contributions to the sustainable development strategy of Sri Lanka However, the rising cost of energy generation, the depletion and the unpredictability of the availability of energy resources and the adverse impact of energy generation and its usage on the environment, have been causing much anxiety and great concern from recent times. The entire world has therefore looked up to energy conservation through frugal and efficient use and through the use of alternate renewable energy sources, as a solution to this grave problem. Within this context, buildings have been considered as one of the largest consumers of energy and has therefore been identified as one of the target areas for energy conservation. Statistics have revealed that the proportion of energy consumed for lighting in buildings is much greater than what is consumed individually for providing thermal comfort or other ancillary services. The principle objective in this study is therefore to explore strategies of designing <b>buildings</b> with optimum <b>utilisation</b> of natural light and efficient application of electrical energy for interior lighting. A number of verification experiments on daylighting were carried out for this task, with different types of scale models of office buildings and windows against a few different external characteristics within the control of the designer. Also, an extensive literary survey on the subject of energy efficient artificial lighting was carried out as related to office lighting The survey on daylighting clearly revealed that multiple windows which were inclined, high ground reflectivity together with top lighting where necessary contributed to obtain good quality lighting in buildings. Such an exercise would totally eliminate the need for artificial lighting during the day or reduce it to an absolute minimum in the worst situations The literary survey on artificial lighting, proved beyond any doubt that task lighting combined with minimum ambient lighting was the most efficient approach to artificial lighting of office spaces Also, the daylighting data and the artificial lighting information collectively provided clues to the ways in which the two types of interior lighting could be effectively combined as when necessary. It is quite evident from the total study that artificial lighting is indispensable It is at least needed as a supplementary light to make any shortfalls in natural lighting or to balance the brightness in an interior when there is an excess of natural light in one part of the space. Therefore, daylight efficient building designs and efficient artificial lighting systems would immensely contribute towards energy conservation, environmental protection and the establishment of a sustainable economic system. Accordingly this study has opened new vistas in to the realms of energy efficient architecture relevant to the Sri Lankan situation...|$|R
40|$|With {{environmental}} protection posing {{as the number}} one global problem, man {{has no choice but}} to reduce his energy consumption. One way to accomplish this is to resort to passive and low-energy systems to maintain thermal comfort in buildings. The conventional and modern designs of wind towers can successfully be used in hot arid regions to maintain thermal comfort (with or without the use of ceiling fans) during all hours of the cooling season, or a fraction of it. Climatic design is one of the best approaches to reduce the energy cost in buildings. Proper design is the first step of defence against the stress of the climate. Buildings should be designed according to the climate of the site, reducing the need for mechanical heating or cooling. Hence maximum natural energy can be used for creating a pleasant environment inside the built envelope. Technology and industry progress in the last decade diffused electronic and informatics' devices in many human activities, and also in <b>building</b> construction. The <b>utilisation</b> and operating opportunities components, increase the reduction of heat losses by varying the thermal insulation, optimise the lighting distribution with louver screens and operate mechanical ventilation for coolness in indoor spaces. In addition to these parameters the intelligent envelope can act for security control and became an important part of the building domotic revolution. Application of simple passive cooling measure is effective in reducing the cooling load of buildings in hot and humid climates. Fourty-three percent reductions can be achieved using a combination of well-established technologies such as glazing, shading, insulation, and natural ventilation. More advanced passive cooling techniques such as roof pond, dynamic insulation, and evaporative water jacket need to be considered more closely. The building sector is a major consumer of both energy and materials worldwide, and that consumption is increasing. Most industrialised countries are in addition becoming more and more dependent on external supplies of conventional energy carriers, i. e., fossil fuels. Energy for heating and cooling can be replaced by new renewable energy sources. New renewable energy sources, however, are usually not economically feasible compared with the traditional carriers. In order to achieve the major changes needed to alleviate the environmental impacts of the building sector, it is necessary to change and develop both the processes in the industry itself, and to build a favourable framework to overcome the present economic, regulatory and institutional barriers. This article describes various designs of low-energy buildings. It also, outlines the effect of dense urban building nature on energy consumption, and its contribution to climate change. Measure, which would help to save energy in buildings, is also presented. Built environment Energy savings in buildings Energy-efficient comfort Climate change...|$|R
40|$|This report details {{some of the}} key {{findings}} of a sociological survey that was undertaken in rural Makondo Parish, Lwengo District in Uganda. The cross-sectional survey was carried out between September and November 2011 and covered all the 15 villages in the Parish. The broad aim of the survey was to assess the livelihoods, health, gender and water governance issues in Makondo Parish. Prior to the survey, several preliminary visits were made to the study area, which were then followed by a rigorous literature review on rural water governance, health and livelihoods in Uganda and globally so as to identify the major themes and variables. These themes were then used to develop a quantitative or structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was structured under the following headings: household and interviewer identification; respondents’ characteristics; household livelihoods and well-being, particularly poverty indicators like main source of income, money earned, dwelling type, and number of meals eaten; knowledge of the importance of safe water; access to safe water, such as type of water sources used, access to improved water sources, transportation of water; health issues like water-related diseases suffered, cost to the household of these diseases, steps taken to mitigate against the diseases; knowledge of hand-pump functionality; household water use and management, such as satisfaction with use, conflicts if any and decision-making on use; perceptions of safe water services and systems such as rating of safe water service delivery and why; knowledge of community-based water management systems and capacity <b>building</b> for sustainable <b>utilisation</b> of safe water. The final version was translated into Luganda, the local vernacular so as not to distort the meaning of the questions. This exercise was carried out by the Makerere University Institute of Languages, and the Luganda version was then used to train the Community Health Workers on how to administer and record standardised interviews, such as mastering the intended meaning of each and every question in the questionnaire, the expected data, recording and editing among others. The CHWs were also trained on how to use a GPS (Global Positioning System) unit so as to capture the necessary data for mapping the household locations. After training the CHWs, the questionnaire was piloted in one of the villages in a neighbouring Parish (called Nanywa) and again revised. The actual field work or data collection started with Misaana village in the North-Eastern part of Makondo Parish, then moved on to Luyiiyi-Kate, Luyiiyi-Protazio and ended with Kiguluka, the last village in the Parish on 14 th November 2011. It took between three to four days on average to complete the survey in each village, and the first day of work in each village involved meeting the Village Chairpersons, explaining to then about the WIL Project, objectives of the survey and seeking their support in locating selected households for interviews. After every two-three days of data collection, meetings were held with the interviewers/CHWs to share fieldwork experiences as well as edit field questionnaires. A total of six hundred and six (606) households selected proportionately across the 15 villages in Makondo Parish were covered in the survey. Despite several challenges that were met during the survey, such as failure by interviewers/CHWs to complete their assigned households in time; heavy rains that made driving on the village roads quite difficult especially in Kiteredde, Kiyumbakimu and Kiguluka villages, the survey was a success and data collection ended quite successfully, as the originally targeted sample was attained...|$|R
