6000|$|Well; 'tis as Bickerstaff has guest, Though we {{all took}} it for a jest: Partridge is dead; nay more, he dy'd, Ere he could prove the good 'squire ly'd. Strange, an astrologer should die Without one wonder in the sky; Not one of all his crony stars To pay their duty at his hearse! No meteor, no eclipse appear'd! No comet with a flaming beard! The sun hath rose and gone to bed, Just as if Partridge were not dead; Nor hid himself behind the moon To make a dreadful night at noon. He at fit periods walks through Aries, Howe'er our earthly motion varies; And twice a-year he'll cut th' Equator, As {{if there had been}} no such matter. [...] Some wits have wonder'd what analogy There is 'twixt cobbling[2] and astrology; How Partridge made his optics rise From a shoe-sole to reach the skies. [...] A list the cobbler's temples ties, To keep the hair out of his eyes; From whence 'tis plain the diadem That princes wear derives from them; And {{therefore}} crowns are now-a-days Adorn'd with golden stars and rays; Which plainly shows the near alliance 'Twixt cobbling and the planet's science. [...] Besides, that slow-paced sign Böötes, As 'tis miscall'd, we know not who 'tis; But Partridge ended all disputes; He knew his trade, and call'd it boots.[3] [...] The horned moon,[4] which heretofore Upon their shoes the Romans wore, Whose wideness kept their toes from corns, And whence we claim our shoeing-horns, Shows how the art of cobbling bears A near resemblance to the spheres. A scrap of parchment hung by geometry, (A great refiner in <b>barometry,)</b> Can, like the stars, foretell the weather; And what is parchment else but leather? Which an astrologer might use Either for almanacks or shoes. [...] Thus Partridge, by his wit and parts, At once did practise both these arts: And as the boding owl (or rather The bat, because her wings are leather) Steals from her private cell by night, And flies about the candle-light; So learned Partridge could as well Creep in the dark from leathern cell, And in his fancy fly as far To peep upon a twinkling star. [...] Besides, he could confound the spheres, And set the planets by the ears; To show his skill, he Mars could join To Venus in aspect malign; Then call in Mercury for aid, And cure the wounds that Venus made. [...] Great scholars have in Lucian read, When Philip King of Greece was dead His soul and spirit did divide, And each part took a different side; One rose a star; the other fell Beneath, and mended shoes in Hell.[5] [...] Thus Partridge still shines in each art, The cobbling and star-gazing part, And is install'd as good a star As any of the Caesars are. [...] Triumphant star! some pity show On cobblers militant below, Whom roguish boys, in stormy nights, Torment by pissing out their lights, Or through a chink convey their smoke, Enclosed artificers to choke.

To thee the Bull will lend his hide, By Phoebus newly tann'd and dry'd; For thee they Argo's hulk will tax, And scrape her pitchy sides for wax: Then Ariadne kindly lends Her braided hair to make thee ends; The points of Sagittarius' dart Turns to an awl by heavenly art; And Vulcan, wheedled by his wife, Will forge for thee a paring-knife. For want of room by Virgo's side, She'll strain a point, and sit[6] astride, To take thee kindly in between; And then the Signs will be Thirteen.|$|E

Legge and, later, Lyndhurst Giblin took over the survey. The surveyors climbed to the plateau from Mangana but on some of the later visits they ascended via Avoca and the Ben Lomond Marshes. The nomenclature of features on the mountain were established at this time and were named after members of the survey party and famous explorers of the period. The survey party explored the highlands on the north of the plateau in 1907. Legge had long suspected that the north of the plateau was higher than the trigonometric station on Stacks Bluff (called by him Ben Lomond Fell or Bluff) but was less obviously elevated. Moreover, the area was, at the time, an area so remote and unexplored that Legge described it as 'untrodden as the distant ranges of the west coast'. Lyndhurst Giblin climbed and measured the true summit and named it after Legge. and, in turn, the prominent bluff to the south of the summit was named for Giblin's father - Giblin Fells.|$|E

The association of amphibole with clinopyroxene and no plagioclase in the most primitive samples (Mg-andesites) is consistent with amphibole fractionation from very hydrous magmas at deep crustal levels of the plumbing system, which may have been a key process in intensifying adakite-type affinities in this rock suite. <b>Barometry,</b> combined with frequent disequilibrium features such as oscillatory-zoned and sieve-textured plagioclase crystals with An-rich overgrowths in more evolved samples, implies that final magma differentiation occurred in an open upper crustal magma system that developed progressively stronger compositional modifications during high-level magma storage...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. We have {{collected}} 20 new paleomagnetic sites from the Mount Stuart batholith and the adjacent Beckler Peak stock.

New technology has allowed for microbeads to be loaded with pressure and/or temperature sensitive dyes. These microbeads can be seeded into flow fields {{in order to}} measure the pressure and/or temperature fields in the fluid flow. In addition, the microbeads act as tracer particles to the fluid velocity and therefore, standard PIV techniques can be applied to quantify the velocity of the flow simultaneously with the pressure and/or temperature measurement. Existing studies have investigated the use of polystyrene microbeads for simultaneous flow <b>barometry</b> and velocimetry yet the polystyrene microbeads have a slow response time to changing pressures, making them incapable of resolving accurate pressures in fast flow applications such as wind tunnels. In this contribution, silicon dioxide and oxide-based multi-dye microbeads were characterized and found to have much faster response times than polystyrene-based microbeads. The pressure response times and sensitivity of these microbeads were tested to determine the most viable candidate for future unsteady applications. It will also be shown that the intensity-based approach applied to these microbeads coated on a glass slide can be used to accurately measure pressure with a significantly high measure of precision and low pressure uncertainties down to 106 Pa.

Based on Al-in-hornblende <b>barometry,</b> the batholith records intrusion pressures from ~ 0. 2  GPa in the north (where the volcano-sedimentary cover is intruded) to max. ~ 0. 9  GPa in the southeast. The Al-in-hornblende <b>barometry</b> demonstrates that the Kohistan batholith represents a complete cross section across an arc batholith, reaching from the top at ~ 8 – 9  km depth (north) to its bottom at 25 – 35  km (south-central to southeast). Despite the complete outcropping and accessibility of the entire batholith, there is no observable compositional stratification across the batholith. The geochemical characteristics of the granitoids define three groups. Group 1 is characterized by strongly enriched incompatible elements and unfractionated middle rare earth elements (MREE) /heavy rare earth element patterns (HREE); Group 2 has enriched incompatible element concentrations similar to Group 1 but strongly fractionated MREE/HREE. Group 3 is characterized by only a limited incompatible element enrichment and unfractionated MREE/HREE. The origin of the different groups can be modeled through a relatively hydrous (Group 1 and 2) and of a less hydrous (Group 3) fractional crystallization line from a primitive basaltic parent at different pressures. Appropriate mafic/ultramafic cumulates that explain the chemical characteristics of each group are preserved {{at the base of the}} arc. The Kohistan batholith strengthens the conclusion that hydrous fractionation is the most important mechanism to form volumetrically significant amounts of granitoids in arcs.

40|$|Abstract. The key {{aspects of}} a new method, bubble-image <b>barometry</b> (BIB), which can measure both {{pressure}} and velocity, are described. BIB extends correlation-based particle-image velocimetry techniques to provide simultaneous pressure and velocity measurements over a global domain. The particles used in BIB (gas bubbles) serve two purposes: (i) they are small enough to track the flow and serve as tracers for the velocity field; and (ii) they behave as local pressure sensors by changing their size {{in response to the}} instantaneous pressure field. The present work explores the theoretical and practical issues involved in BIB by first introducing the relation between the bubble-image size and its spatial correlation function. Next, computer-generated bubble images are used to investigate the feasibility of the technique.

Results obtained from the experiment show that BIB is a viable technique for a certain range of bubble sizes...|$|E

40|$|Impact {{cratering}} {{was once}} considered a rare geological process of no, or little, {{importance to the}} evolution of the Solar System and planet Earth. After more than 50 years of space exploration and the discovery of numerous (~ 190 as of October 2016) impact structures on Earth, this view has changed, and {{it is now clear that}} impact craters are in fact one of the most common morphological features on solid bodies in the Solar System. The formation of a (hypervelocity) impact crater involves extreme conditions that cannot be compared with any other natural geological process, with extreme pressures and temperatures causing melting and/or vaporization of both projectile and portions of the target rocks. Upon impact, shock waves are generated at the projectile-target interface, which pass through the target rocks at supersonic velocity. The passage of the shock waves induce irreversible changes, so called shock metamorphic effects in the target rocks, including the formation of high pressure mineral polymorphs, diaplectic glasses, and microdeformation features in minerals. The most investigated of these microstructures are planar deformation features (PDFs) in quartz. These are straight, parallel, closely spaced (2 - 10 µm apart), sets of (when fresh) glass lamellae only naturally formed by impact cratering. PDFs are oriented parallel to specific crystallographic planes, with the most frequently reported orientations being parallel to low Miller-Bravais index planes (e. g., { 10 ‾ 13 }, { 10 ‾ 12 }). The orientation pattern of a PDF population differ depending on the pressure that the host quartz grain was subjected to, meaning that the orientations of PDFs can be used as a shock barometer, allowing e. g., production of shock <b>barometry</b> profiles that illustrate shock attenuation at impact structures. The research presented in this thesis focuses on impact craters, and the process by which they form, impact cratering, with special emphasis on shock metamorphic features in target rocks at the Siljan impact structure (Sweden). The results and discussion highlight the importance of the way datasets of PDF statistics are obtained and processed, using manual and/or automated methods of indexing. The interpretation of the dataset can influence the shock <b>barometry</b> models, and the need for a unified method is discussed. With regards to the Siljan impact structure, the pre-erosional rim-to-rim diameter of the crater was estimated to be on the order of 60 km, based on a combination of shock <b>barometry</b> and numerical simulation, produced by a collision between a ~ 5 km diameter projectile and Earth. Results of the numerical modeling are consistent with a sedimentary thickness overlying the crystalline basement at the time of impact of ~ 2. 5 km, and post-impact erosion of the crater on the order of 3 to 3. 5 km. The thesis also encompasses studies of two other, newly confirmed, Swedish impact structures, Målingen and Hummeln. The possible means of formation for both Målingen and Hummeln had been discussed for many years before the first bona fide evidence for the impact origin of the two structures was presented in papers included in this thesis. Furthermore, terrestrial impact structures with reliable ages (i. e., errors on age of less than 2 %) are discussed in the context of possible variations in the impactor flux to Earth over time. According to the results, there is presently no evidence for the existence of a periodic contribution to the terrestrial impact population...|$|E
40|$|A dike network transecting a {{basement}} of intrusive and metamorphic rocks {{related to the}} Hercynian orogeny is exposed in the Sila Grande (southern Italy). Dike magmatism, similarly to {{other regions of the}} western Mediterranean, such as Sardinia, Corsica, and Catalonia, is of calc-alkaline to alkali-calcic affinity. Zircon U-Pb geochronology indicates that dike magmatism took place between 295 +/- 1 to 277 +/- 1 Ma, after the main late Hercynian emplacement of granitoids (306 +/- 1 Ma). <b>Barometry</b> indicates that the basement underwent exhumation of 8 +/- 3 km before dike injection. The dike network has a geometrical arrangement consistent with a transtensional stress regime that resulted in ductile thinning of the lower crust during the late stage of the Hercynian orogeny and concurrent fracturing of the upper crust that made possible magma ascent through dikes. The proposed tectonic evolution is related to dismemberment of the southern Hercynian belt in the central Mediterranean area as a result of dextral transtension of Gondwana in relation to Laurasia during the Pennsylvanian-Early Permian...|$|E
40|$|Carbon dioxide-rich {{inclusions}} commonly {{occur in}} the banded charnockites and khondalites of southern Kerala {{as well as in}} the incipient charnockites formed by desiccation of gneisses along oriented zones. The combined high density fluid inclusion isochores and the range of thermometric estimates from mineral assemblages indicate entrapment pressures in the range of 5. 4 to 6. 1 Kbar. The CO 2 equation of state <b>barometry</b> closely compares with the 5 plus or minus 1 Kbar estimate from mineral phases for the region. The isochores for the high density fluid inclusions in all the three rock types pass through the P-T domain recorded by phase equilibria, implying that carbon dioxide was the dominating ambient fluid species during peak metamorphic conditions. In order to constrain the source of fluids and to evaluate the mechanism of desiccation, researchers undertook detailed investigations of the carbon stable isotope composition of entrapped fluids. Researchers report here the results of preliminary studies in some of the classic localities in southern Kerala namely, Ponmudi, Kottavattom, Manali and Kadakamon...|$|E
40|$|Free flap {{reconstruction}} of a defect on an extremity with an arteriovenous fistula is a surgical challenge {{due to the}} unique hemodynamic characteristics of an arteriovenous fistula and its potential complications. There is a paucity of evidence in the literature describing free flap reconstructions adjacent to arteriovenous fistulae. We present a successful case of an 86 -year-old man with end-stage renal disease who underwent an anterolateral thigh free flap {{reconstruction of}} a hand defect immediately adjacent to his pre-existing radiocephalic fistula. The free flap recipient vessels used were the dorsal branch of the ulnar artery, {{a tributary of the}} basilic vein and a vena comitans. Recipient veins were carefully chosen based on intra-operative <b>barometry.</b> The free flap reconstruction showed no signs of venous insufficiency or compromise at any stage. The radiocephalic fistula was never disrupted, nor was there any complication regarding the arteriovenous fistula. The patient maintained his regular hemodialysis throughout his care with routine arteriovenous fistula access. The patient was reviewed six months post-op with no complications and he had returned to living independently in his own home. From our experience of this case, pre-existing arteriovenous fistulae should not preclude patients from undergoing free flap reconstructions if indicated...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into review section {{followed}} by an experimental part. The first part focuses on geothermobarometry, illustrates its history and provides its detailed principles. Furthermore, it discusses various possibilities {{of the use of}} different mineral assemblages for purposes of thermometry and <b>barometry.</b> This part puts an emphasis on exchange reactions, the role of solvus in themometry, reactions based on weight transfers, and reactions involving gas phases. A chapter on Macedonian geography and regional geology provides {{a detailed description of the}} Vardar ophiolite belt, which was the source of the samples used in experimental part of the thesis, and its relationship toand other geological units in Macedonia, namely the Eastern Vardar Ophiolite zones, the Kopaonik unit, and the western part of the Vardar Ophiolite zone. Finally, a process of exsolution in subsolidus, which is impostant for the group of pyroxenes, is discussed. The area of interest is the use of the process of exsolution in thermometry. The thermodynamic conditions for exsolution are important features of the exsolution. The experimental part of the thesis includes a description of the samples and results of chemical analyses carried out with an electron probe microanalyzer. Chemical data were processed with two [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{manganese}} on {{the stability of}} ferrosilite relative to fayalite + quartz has been experimentally determined to assess its importance to orthopyroxene <b>barometry.</b> Reaction reversals in a piston-cylinder apparatus were obtained to within 0. 1 -kbar intervals indicating instability of Fs 95 Rh 5 below 10. 3, 10. 9, 11. 4, 12. 2, 12. 9, 13. 7 kbar and Fs 90 Rh 10 below 9. 8, 10. 4, 10. 9, 11. 6, 12. 4 and 13. 2 kbar at 750, 800, 850, 900, 950 and 1000 [deg]C, respectively. Each mole % MnSiO 3 extends the pyroxene stability by approximately 0. 12 kbar relative to FeSiO 3. Electron microprobe analyses of run products indicate a small preference of Mn for pyroxene over olivine with KD Mn-Feopx-oliv = 1. 2 - 1. 5, similar to values observed for natural pairs. Mossbauer spectra are consistent with a random distribution of Mn between the M 1 and M 2 sites in the orthopyroxene. These experimental data allow downward revision of pressure estimates based on the orthopyroxene barometer in areas where Mn is a significant component in orthopyroxene...|$|E
