5000|$|On lap 20, Newgarden {{was able}} to move around Castroneves and pull away, placing himself solidly in the lead.

Derek Warwick and Nigel Mansell collided and had to pit for a puncture and a new nosecone, respectively. Senna was trying very hard to make up for the lost positions, and had gained six places by the start of lap two. He then passed Riccardo Patrese, Thierry Boutsen, Alessandro Nannini and Michele Alboreto to take fourth place on lap four. Meanwhile, Capelli had not only set the fastest lap but also passed Berger - who was already troubled with fuel consumption problems - on lap five to take second place.

50|$|Push {{starting}}, {{also known}} as <b>bump</b> <b>starting,</b> clutch starting, popping the clutch or crash starting is a method of starting a motor vehicle with an internal combustion engine by engaging the manual transmission whilst the vehicle is in motion.

5000|$|ABC {{had always}} had a close {{association}} with the Sopwith aircraft company. They were both at Brooklands and in 1912 a Sopwith with an ABC engine flown by Harry Hawker had won the Michelin Endurance Prize. In December 1918 {{it was announced that}} ABC had transferred the rights for manufacturing and selling motor cycles to Sopwith Aviation Co Ltd, allowing Granville Bradshaw of ABC Motors to focus on design. In 1919 they jointly exhibited the Sopwith 390 cc horizontally opposed twin-cylinder overhead valve (OHV) machine at the annual Motor Cycle show. It aroused a lot of interest with innovative front and rear leaf springs and [...] "expanding" [...] brakes, wet sump lubrication, and a four-speed gearbox. It {{was also one of the}} first motorcycles with a duplex cradle frame. One thing it did not have, however, was any form of starting mechanism; the rider had to [...] "paddle" [...] or <b>bump</b> <b>start</b> to get the engine going. The ABC 400 was made under licence by the Sopwith Aviation & Engineering Co in Kingston-upon-Thames and 2,200 were produced. Later models had improved valve gear, speedometers, and electric lighting. Sidecar outfits were also produced as optional extras.|$|E
5000|$|Chivas is {{best remembered}} however for a sensational second {{place at the}} 1973 Hardie-Ferodo 1000. While co-driving with Peter Brock in the Holden Dealer Team's leading LJ Torana GTR XU-1 the car ran out of fuel {{and had to be}} pushed by Chivas, unaided (as per the rules), along part of pit lane that went {{slightly}} uphill. The exhausted 50-year-old had to be supported by pit crew after the effort of pushing the car in the hot conditions (and being flung aside by an anxious Brock), but the time lost may have cost the Brock/Chivas Torana a Bathurst victory. Chivas was sent a message via his pit board to [...] "GET MAX LAPS", but unfortunately went one lap too far and ran out of fuel at the Reid Park section of the 6.172 km (3.835 mi) Mount Panorama Circuit, though luckily from there most of the over 3 km's back to the pits was downhill. According to popular theory, the car should have coasted into the pits without the need for Chivas to get out and push, but he tried to <b>bump</b> <b>start</b> the car just before he got to the pits hoping there was enough fuel left to re-start, though the car came to a stop about 20 metres short of the pit entry.|$|E

50|$|All {{internal}} combustion engines require {{some form of}} system {{to get them into}} operation. Most piston engines use a starter motor powered by the same battery as runs the rest of the electric systems. Large jet engines and gas turbines are started with a compressed air motor that is geared to one of the engine's driveshafts. Compressed air can be supplied from another engine, a unit on the ground or by the aircraft's APU. Small {{internal combustion}} engines are often started by pull cords. Motorcycles of all sizes were traditionally kick-started, though all but the smallest are now electric-start. Large stationary and marine engines may be started by the timed injection of compressed air into the cylinders — or occasionally with cartridges. Jump starting refers to assistance from another battery (typically when the fitted battery is discharged), while <b>bump</b> <b>starting</b> refers to an alternative method of starting by the application of some external force, e.g. rolling down a hill.|$|R

Whilst he was able to recover these places and get back to second place by lap 8, he could not catch Senna who controlled the gap according to the traffic. Maintaining a lead of 6-10 seconds, Senna slowed on the last lap to make sure he finished without running out of fuel which reduced the gap to the pursuing Prost to just 2.3 seconds at the line. Prost later admitted he had turned up his turbo boost in his fight up to second and although still lapping quicker than most of the field, he was then forced to conserve {{for the rest of the}} race for fear of running dry before the end.|$|R

50|$|Generally, and at Oxford during Eights Week, once a bump has {{occurred}} both crews pull {{over to the}} river bank and take no further part in that race. At Oxford during Torpids a bumping crew pulls over but the bumped crew must continue racing over the entire course and can be bumped {{by more than one}} crew per day. As bumps racing usually takes place on narrow stretches of water, when contact occurs, two or more boats can become tangled up or not clear the river quickly enough, causing the racing line to be blocked. This can be very dangerous and the chance of boats getting damaged is high. To avoid this, the cox of the boat being bumped can concede as soon as slight physical contact occurs or even once it is inevitable. Nonetheless, collisions involving several boats are common. Crews in Torpids tend to concede bumps early to avoid being entangled with the crew that caught them: should they be unable to continue, other boats may row past, overtake and 'bump' the stationary crew. Any crew that has been <b>bumped</b> <b>starts</b> the next race behind the boat or boats that caught it; they switch places. A boat which reaches the finish line without either bumping or being bumped is said to have 'rowed over' and stays in the same position.|$|R

5000|$|Hawthorn won the [...] Formula One Championship despite {{achieving}} {{only one}} win, against four by Moss. Hawthorn won the 1958 French Grand Prix at Reims, in which Musso was fatally injured while {{in second place}} (see Rivalry with Luigi Musso below). Leading easily in the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix at half distance, his 246 engine blew, while at Monza he was a minute ahead of Tony Brooks when his clutch forced him to slow to second place. Hawthorn benefited greatly from the gentlemanliness of Moss, as demonstrated at the 1958 Portuguese Grand Prix at Porto. Hawthorn was disqualified for <b>bump</b> <b>starting</b> his stalled car downhill in the opposite direction, {{on the way to}} a second-place finish. Moss interceded on Hawthorn's behalf and the decision was ultimately reversed. After a pit stop midway through that race, Hawthorn accelerated back through the field to gain an extra point for fastest lap. Moss had failed to respond, possibly doubting Hawthorn could lap so fast with damaged drum brakes. This extra world championship point plus the second place points contributed to Hawthorn winning the championship with a season total just one more than that of Moss. In the final race, the 1958 Moroccan Grand Prix, Hawthorn drove a conservative tactical race aiming to stay ahead of Moss's Vanwall teammates. Brooks's car broke while narrowly leading Hawthorn, and Stuart Lewis-Evans in the third Vanwall crashed after a desperate attempt to move through the field and challenge Hawthorn running third; Evans later died of burns. In the last laps, second-placed Phil Hill slowed and waved Hawthorn through to gain enough points to take the Championship; the first ever to be won by an English driver.|$|R
