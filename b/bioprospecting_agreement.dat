50|$|Negotiations {{that began}} between Washington University and CAH on a <b>bioprospecting</b> <b>agreement</b> failed when Washington University's Walter Lewis {{collected}} Aguaruna medicinal plants and knowledge without a benefit-sharing agreement in place, leading to claims of biopiracy. The CAH terminated {{its relationship with}} Walter Lewis, Washington University, and their US government sponsors.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} Aguaruna were {{involved}} in negotiating a novel <b>bioprospecting</b> <b>agreement</b> with a US-based pharmaceutical multinational, G.D. Searle & Company (then part of Monsanto), {{and a group of}} ethnobotanists from Washington University. The project involved a controversy over violations of the Aguarunas' rights over their genetic and cultural resources and to an equitable share in the potential profits derived from pharmaceuticals based on their traditional knowledge of medicinal plants. The US National Institutes of Health froze funding to the Washington University scientists.|$|E
40|$|Bioprospecting is a {{controversial}} issue, and anthropologists {{and other scientists}} are quick to take sides. The idea of large corporations pumping money into conservation and development programs, while developing {{what could be the}} latest life-saving drug simply sounds too good to be true, and often times is. However, if all parties work together and proceed with caution, these benefits could become more than a fantasy. Looking at case studies from Costa Rica, India, South Africa and Panama this paper attempts to find patterns among successful <b>bioprospecting</b> <b>agreements</b> and note shortcomings and identify risks. This information will be used to suggest how indigenous communities can maximize benefits while protecting their rights in bioprospecting relationships...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBioprospecting {{agreements}} and Payments for Environmental Services (PES) are both {{based on the}} promise of market environmental efficiency. By adapting the concept of the “economy of promises” (developed by Science, Technology and Society scholars, regarding technological innovation) and applying it to institutional and political innovation, this paper analyses the rhetorical dimensions, the performativity, and the implementation of <b>bioprospecting</b> <b>agreements</b> and PES. We argue that the strength of these mechanisms lies in their performativity — in particular, in their ability to shape institutions in a neo-liberal fashion, rather than in their actualisation as markets or their environmental achievements, which are both incomplete and difficult to accomplish. Far from realising the free-market ideal that they are purported to achieve, these mechanisms actually perform incomplete commodification, they require complex institutional arrangements in order to be effective, and they give rise to a low volume of transactions. The economy of promises provides a fresh and complementary reading of the neo-liberalisation of nature as a complex of discursive, institutional and material dimensions...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{research}} and development programs, entry-deterance has manifested itself in preemptive patenting, whereby a monopolist will patent untested research leads to prevent competitors from challenging its position in the market. Our e¤ort studies how the lure of monopoly power impacts 8 ̆ 5 rm behavior in the search for a new product prior to the discovery of a success. We model the research and development process as a compet-itive search through research leads, with the incorporation of competition representing a contribution to the existing literature. We 8 ̆ 5 nd that, in the presence of competition, a 8 ̆ 5 rm may have the incentive to preemptively exclude its competition from searching a portion of the research leads. Such preemptive exclusion increases the probability that a discovery of a success will result in monopoly pro 8 ̆ 5 ts. We discuss the implications of the results for the issue of bioprospecting as a motivation for pharmaceutical 8 ̆ 5 rms to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity. Our 8 ̆ 5 ndings suggest that pharmaceutical 8 ̆ 5 rms are willing to enter <b>bioprospecting</b> <b>agreements</b> with host nations, with the caveat that there may be concern about the ability of host nations to adequately protect the intellectual property rights of the pharmaceutical 8 ̆ 5 rms...|$|R
40|$|For several decades, {{pharmaceutical}} companies {{have engaged in}} bioprospecting activities in developing countries. However, in many cases, these companies have failed to compensate local peoples for their knowledge used {{in the production of}} drugs. Consequently, these activities have been subject to intense scrutiny at the national and international level. This awareness has contributed to the elaboration of international laws and novel bioprospecting initiatives. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), laws that regulate access to genetic resources, and the International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups (ICBGs) are approaches that address unique issues pertaining to bioprospecting of genetic resources. However, these approaches are not flawless. They are experiments that need to be tested and analyzed. The main objectives of this dissertation are to: (1) analyze the relationship between these approaches and how they address the issue of bioprospecting; and (2) identify bioprospecting guidelines to facilitate the implementation of future bioprospecting projects. These objectives are addressed through the analysis of a conceptual framework for the implementation of the ICBGs. According to this framework implementation of the ICBGs should be made according to the following four factors: (1) the CBD, (2) contractual relationships between parties of bioprospecting groups, (3) contractual provisions of <b>bioprospecting</b> <b>agreements,</b> and (4) in-country laws, policies and the organizational structure of the government. These factors have and will continue to affect the implementation of the ICBGs and other bioprospecting groups. A thorough analysis of them {{in the context of the}} ICBGs and in comparison to other projects provides elements for the identification of valuable lessons for future bioprospecting initiatives...|$|R
