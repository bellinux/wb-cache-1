5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Federation {{starship}} Enterprise. In this episode, the Enterprise is caught in a time loop which results in the destruction of the ship and the loss of all hands after a collision with the USS Bozeman. As events re-occur, they <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> a sense of déjà vu and upon investigating, realize their predicament. Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) realizes how to pass a brief message to himself in the next loop, which allows him to save the ship from destruction.|$|E
25|$|Chronic encephalomyelitis, {{which may}} be progressive, can involve {{cognitive}} impairment, brain fog, migraines, balance issues, weakness in the legs, awkward gait, facial palsy, bladder problems, vertigo, and back pain. In rare cases, untreated Lyme disease may cause frank psychosis, which has been misdiagnosed as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Panic attacks and anxiety can occur; also, delusional behavior may be seen, including somatoform delusions, sometimes accompanied by a depersonalization or derealization syndrome, where the patients <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> detached from themselves or from reality.|$|E
25|$|Members {{describe}} {{their sense of}} relaxation and liberation, and the increasing value of restraint and modesty in their lives. Their testimonies show that, paradoxically, it is by becoming aware of their powerlessness and accepting the self's basic limitations that they <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the recovering self's growing power. At the same time, personal responsibility replaces self-pity and the expectation that others will act {{for the good of}} the individual. With these old attitudes, egocentricity and exaggerated, false self-confidence perpetuate the problem which led them to join OA. While their eating disorder was active, many OA members claimed that their experience of self was composed of an obsessive aspiration for perfection which concealed their sense of worthlessness.|$|E

25|$|The next affective {{emotion in}} this {{beginning}} stage is incompetence. Feeling incompetent can spring from multiple {{things in a}} relationship, but during {{the initial stages of}} infidelity a person can experience this on an increased level. Meaning, they begin to notice when their partner does not say thank you for simple things, or they overthink any change made by the unfaithful partner. This can lead to a suspicious partner feeling like they cannot please their significant other and <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> incompetent in the relationship. When someone is having incompetent feelings due to someone else’s actions they begin to resent them creating a build-up and eventually an affective emotion outburst over something small. The faithful partner is not normally aware that their suspicion is the reason they feel incompetent in the relationship, and do not expect to be so irritated by the change of simple things; making it an affective response in this stage of infidelity (Miller, 2017). These unanticipated emotions could lead to more and multiple responses such as this one within the future of the initial stage of infidelity.|$|E

Lennon said, [...] "I just couldn't function, you know? I was so paranoid from them tappin' the phone and followin' me." [...] All this combined made Lennon <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> emotionally withdrawn. Lennon put his suffering aside to write the songs for Mind Games, writing all the songs for it in a week.|$|E
500|$|Lowell {{returned}} to the United States and began his duties at Harvard {{in the summer of}} 1856. Still grieving the loss of his wife, however, he avoided Elmwood, lodging instead in an area known as Professors' Row on Kirkland Street in Cambridge along with his daughter Mabel and her governess Frances Dunlap. Lowell and Dunlap married in 1857. After the death of Lowell's father in January 1861 due to a heart attack, he moved back to Elmwood with his family. Despite avoiding the home for so long, he was pleased to be back. He wrote to his friend Charles Frederick Briggs: [...] "I am back again to the place I love best. I am sitting in my old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... I <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> more like my old self than I have these ten years". However, Elmwood's expenses drained him, with taxes at $1,000 a year. As early as 1867, he considered renting out Elmwood and moving into a smaller home elsewhere but never did. Instead, to ease his financial plight, he began to sell off land in 1870 until only two and a half acres remained.|$|E
60|$|From {{that period}} his penance had become severe.

500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1857, The Atlantic Monthly was established, and Lowell was its first editor. With its first issue in November of that year, he at once gave the {{magazine}} the stamp of high literature and of bold speech on public affairs. In January 1861, Lowell's father {{died of a heart}} attack, inspiring Lowell to move his family back to Elmwood. As he wrote to his friend Briggs, [...] "I am back again to the place I love best. I am sitting in my old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... I <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> more like my old self than I have these ten years." [...] Shortly thereafter, in May, he left The Atlantic Monthly when James Thomas Fields took over as editor; the magazine had been purchased by Ticknor and Fields for $10,000 two years before. Lowell returned to Elmwood by January 1861 but maintained an amicable relationship with the new owners of the journal, continuing to submit his poetry and prose {{for the rest of his}} life. His prose, however, was more abundantly presented in the pages of the North American Review during the years 1862–1872. For the Review, he served as a coeditor along with Charles Eliot Norton. Lowell's reviews for the journal covered a wide variety of literary releases of the day, though he was writing fewer poems.|$|E

This means around-the-clock coverage. Rather {{than having a}} certain deadline for scheduled newscasts to meet, reporters have to file stories {{as fast as they}} can.

2500|$|In {{accordance}} with this policy, Allan was force-fed {{for a full}} week. Forcible feeding was an ordeal described by Pankhurst as a [...] "horrible outrage", and has been likened by women's history scholar June Purvis {{to a form of}} rape. In a later letter to a friend, Allan herself stated that [...] "I did not resist at all ... yet the effect on my health was most disastrous. I am a very strong woman and absolutely sound in heart and lungs, but it was not till 5 months after, that I was able to take any exercise or <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> in my usual health again – the nerves of my heart were affected and I was fit for nothing In the way of exertion ...

The words [...] "in" [...] and [...] "out" [...] should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object's relation to a gravitational center, the Earth. [...] "I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going [...] "outstairs" [...] and [...] "instairs."' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it. But if they try saying in and {{out for a few}} days in fun, they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> real 'reality.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the season}} progresses, the four girls <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{uncertain}} about Alison and whether she is telling them the truth, and Alison begins {{to lose their}} trust. The friendship hits a breaking point when Ali has to identify her so-called [...] "kidnapper", and the girls realize that Alison has lied to them the entire time she has been back. They ultimately decide that she can't be trusted anymore. They then set up a plan to confess everything to the police. However, 'A' stops them before they can go through with the plan, and the liars find out that Alison has gone rogue. Teaming up with Mona, they discover that the police suspect Spencer of killing Bethany Young, and that Mrs. DiLaurentis {{had an affair with}} Bethany Young's father. Mona then tells the girls she thinks that Alison is 'A'. Subsequently, Mona is [...] "killed", and Spencer is arrested for Bethany Young's murder.|$|E
2500|$|Signalman First Class Billy [...] "Badass" [...] Buddusky (Jack Nicholson) and Gunner's Mate First Class Richard [...] "Mule" [...] Mulhall (Otis Young) are {{awaiting}} orders in Norfolk, Virginia {{when they are}} assigned a shore patrol detail escorting a young sailor, Seaman Larry Meadows (Randy Quaid), to Portsmouth Naval Prison near Kittery, Maine. Meadows has drawn a stiff eight-year sentence for the petty crime of trying to steal $40 from a collection box of his Commanding Officer's wife's favorite charity. Despite their initial resentment of the detail, the two Navy [...] "lifers" [...] begin to like Meadows as they escort him on a train ride through the wintry northeastern states; particularly as they know what the Marine guards are like at Portsmouth and the grim reality facing their young prisoner. As the pair <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> sorry for Meadows and the youthful experiences he will lose being incarcerated, they decide to show him a good time before delivering him to the authorities.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{cognitive}} {{responses in}} the young stages of infidelity are incompetence and resentfulness. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity, the feeling of incompetence can lead to cognitive resentment. The partner being cheated on will <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that anything and everything they do is not enough to keep their unfaithful partner from straying which in turn makes them feel incompetent. They may feel incompetent in the ways of love, affection, or sex. Whenever an individual suspects that they are being cheated on they try to change their behavior in hopes of keeping or getting their partner’s attention back onto themselves instead of on the person whom they are having another relationship with (Johnson, 2017). People cheat for many reasons and each of those can cause a faithful person to believe they are not competent enough to be in a romantic relationship. This feeling leads to the resentment of the unfaithful partner’s actions and becomes an ongoing emotion throughout the stages of infidelity instead of simply being a quick and immediate response to a partner’s actions. The accuser begins to anticipate feeling rejected by their significant other, therefore, they have resentful cognitive responses towards the accused.|$|E

2500|$|The {{review in}} The Times issue of 16 May 1928 began, [...] "Another French detective! We islanders might <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> jealous, {{if we did}} not {{remember}} what a start Poe and Gaboriau gave our neighbours". The review questioned, [...] "whether you can make a play out of theoretical analysis. The old melodramas based themselves upon passion: then – shall we say with William Gillette's Sherlock Holmes and Sir Gerald du Maurier's Raffles? – personality usurped its place. A pure problem has not the dramatic force of either. If we do not weary of Poirot shooting questions to left and right, Poirot with uplifted finger expounding his views to a half-circle of listeners, it is because Mr. Charles Laughton, {{with a little help from}} the text, makes a personality out of the fat and sentimental little ratiocinator. His Poirot is an admirable comedy sketch, convincingly gallic." [...] The review stated that Lady Tree had no scope within the part given to her to invest the part of Mrs. Ackroyd with personality but [...] "competence was all that was demanded from her, and from the rest of the cast, and it was generally forthcoming. One actor singled out for praise was Henry Daniell for his [...] "imperturbably natural butler" [...] however his [...] "mystery...was not...analysed enough".|$|E
2500|$|When {{exploring}} {{the etiology of}} bulimia through a socio-cultural perspective, the [...] "thin ideal internalization" [...] is significantly responsible. The thin ideal internalization {{is the extent to}} which individuals adapt to the societal ideals of attractiveness. Studies have shown that young females that read fashion magazines tend to have more bulimic symptoms than those females who do not. This further demonstrates the impact of media on the likelihood of developing the disorder. Individuals first accept and [...] "buy into" [...] the ideals, and then attempt to transform themselves in order to reflect the societal ideals of attractiveness. J. Kevin Thompson and Eric Stice claim that family, peers, and most evidently media reinforce the thin ideal, which may lead to an individual accepting and [...] "buying into" [...] the thin ideal. In turn, Thompson and Stice assert that if the thin ideal is accepted, one could <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable with their body shape or size since it may not necessarily reflect the thin ideal set out by society. Thus, people feeling uncomfortable with their bodies may result in suffering from body dissatisfaction and may develop a certain drive for thinness. Consequently, body dissatisfaction coupled with a drive for thinness is thought to promote dieting and negative effects, which could eventually lead to bulimic symptoms such as purging or bingeing. Binges lead to self-disgust which causes purging to prevent weight gain.|$|E
