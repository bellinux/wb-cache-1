50|$|Earlier {{forms of}} email {{addresses}} on other networks than the Internet included other notations, {{such as that}} required by X.400, and the UUCP <b>bang</b> <b>path</b> notation, in which the address was given {{in the form of}} a sequence of computers through which the message should be relayed. This was widely used for several years, but was superseded by the Internet standards promulgated by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).|$|E
50|$|As UUCP hosts {{were not}} always uniquely named, {{and there was no}} {{official}} global table listing them, although the UUCP Mapping Project was an informal effort to create such a list, actual access to one (e.g., for routing e-mail to it) required the use of a full <b>bang</b> <b>path,</b> which did not follow domain-name-style syntax, unless the particular software being used had been programmed to recognize particular hostnames in a domain style and route to them.|$|E
50|$|The name uucp was a pseudo-domain-style suffix {{used in the}} 1980s when {{identifying}} a hostname not connected directly to the Internet, but possibly reachable through other inter-network gateways. The suffix was appended to a UUCP <b>bang</b> <b>path</b> separated with a dot, e.g., host1!host2!host3.uucp.The suffix prevented messages from being routed via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) in mail exchangers, and it indicated that the hostname preceding it was reachable by UUCP networking. It was not a top-level domain in the Domain Name System (DNS) root.|$|E

5000|$|An {{email address}} {{of this form}} {{was known as a}} <b>bang</b> path.Bang <b>paths</b> of eight to ten {{machines}} (or hops) were not uncommon in 1981, and late-night dial-up UUCP links would cause week-long transmission times. <b>Bang</b> <b>paths</b> were often selected by both transmission time and reliability, as messages would often get lost. Some hosts {{went so far as to}} try to [...] "rewrite" [...] the path, sending mail via [...] "faster" [...] routes—this practice tended to be frowned upon.|$|R
50|$|Usenet {{traffic was}} {{originally}} transmitted over the UUCP protocol using <b>bang</b> <b>paths.</b> These {{are still in}} use within Usenet message format Path header lines. They now have only an informational purpose, and are not used for routing, although {{they can be used}} to ensure that loops do not occur.|$|R
5000|$|Historically all mail {{transfer}} agents (MTAs) added their host {{name to the}} reverse path. In the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) this reverse path {{is also known as}} MAIL FROM, but paths were also used before and outside of SMTP, e.g. as <b>bang</b> <b>paths</b> in UUCP and Usenet (NetNews). All news articles still contain a Path header, example: ...|$|R
5000|$|In general, {{like other}} older e-mail address formats, <b>bang</b> <b>paths</b> {{have now been}} {{superseded}} by the [...] "@ notation", even by sites still using UUCP. A UUCP-only site can register a DNS domain name, and have the DNS server that handles that domain provide MX records that cause Internet mail to that site to be delivered to a UUCP host on the Internet that can then deliver the mail to the UUCP site.|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of local}} {{availability}} of mathematics (LAM) and space time dependent number scaling on physics and, especially, geometry are described. LAM assumes separate mathematical systems as structures at each space time point. Extension of gauge theories to include {{freedom of choice}} of scaling for number structures, and other structures based on numbers, results in a space time dependent scaling factor based on a scalar boson field. Scaling {{has no effect on}} comparison of experimental results with one another or with theory computations. With LAM all theory expressions are elements of mathematics at some reference point. Changing the reference point introduces (external) scaling. Theory expressions with integrals or derivatives over space or time include scaling factors (internal scaling) that cannot be removed by reference point change. Line elements and path lengths, as integrals over space and/or time, show the effect of scaling on geometry. In one example, the scaling factor goes to 0 as the time goes to 0, the big <b>bang</b> time. All <b>path</b> lengths, and values of physical quantities, are crushed to 0 as $t$ goes to 0. Other examples have spherically symmetric scaling factors about some point, $x. $ In one type, a black scaling hole, the scaling factor goes to infinity as the distance, $d$, between any point $y$ and $x$ goes to 0. For scaling white holes, the scaling factor goes to 0 as $d$ goes to 0. For black scaling holes, path lengths from a reference point, $z$, to $y$ become infinite as $y$ approaches $x. $ For white holes, path lengths approach a value much less than the unscaled distance from $z$ to $x. $Comment: 22 pages, 4 figures; to appear in proceedings, Quantum information and computation XI, SPIE conference proceedings, Vol. 8749, May 1 - 3, Baltimore, M...|$|R
