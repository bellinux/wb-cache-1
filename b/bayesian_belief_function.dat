40|$|The {{study of}} {{alternative}} probabilistic transformation (PT) in DS theory has emerged recently as an interesting topic, especially {{in decision making}} applications. These recent studies have mainly focused on investigating various schemes for assigning both the mass of compound focal elements to each singleton {{in order to obtain}} <b>Bayesian</b> <b>belief</b> <b>function</b> for realworld decision making problems. In this paper, work by us also takes inspiration from both Bayesian transformation camps, with a novel evolutionary-based probabilistic transformation (EPT) to select the qualified <b>Bayesian</b> <b>belief</b> <b>function</b> with the maximum value of probabilistic information content (PIC) benefiting from the global optimizing capabilities of evolutionary algorithms. Verification of EPT is carried out by testing it on a set of numerical examples on 4 D frames. On each problem instance, comparisons are made between the novel method and those existing approaches, which illustrate the superiority of the proposed method in this paper.

40|$|International audienceApproximating {{a belief}} {{function}} (with a probability distribution or with another belief function with a restricted number of focal elements) {{is an important}} issue in Dempster-Shafer Theory. The reason is that such approximations are really useful in two different situations: (1) decision making and (2) computational saving. In this paper, we propose to consider the definition of a proxy for a belief function {{as the result of the}} Dempster's combination of two belief functions: The first one is the belief function to approximate and the second one is a <b>Bayesian</b> <b>belief</b> <b>function</b> which encodes a meta-information describing the support of the approximation (i. e. the set of the potential focal elements of the proxy) ...|$|E
40|$|Information {{exchange}} systems {{differ in}} many ways, but all {{share a common}} vulnerability to selfish behavior and free-riding. In this paper, we build incentives schemes based on social norms. Social norms prescribe a social strategy for the users in the system to follow and deploy reputation schemes to reward or penalize users depending on their behaviors. Because users in these systems often have only limited capability to observe the global system information, e. g. the reputation distribution of the users participating in the system, their beliefs about the reputation distribution are heterogeneous and biased. Such belief heterogeneity causes a positive fraction of users to not follow the social strategy. In such practical scenarios, the standard equilibrium analysis deployed in the economics literature is no longer directly applicable and hence, the system design needs to consider these differences. To investigate how the system designs need to change when the participating users have only limited observations, we focus on a simple social norm with binary reputation labels but allow adjusting the punishment severity through randomization. First, we model the belief heterogeneity using a suitable <b>Bayesian</b> <b>belief</b> <b>function.</b> Next, we formalize the users' optimal decision problems and derive in which scenarios they follow the prescribed social strategy. With this result, we then study the system dynamics and formally define equilibrium {{in the sense that}} the system is stable when users strategically optimize their decisions. By rigorously studying two specific cases where users' belief distribution is constant or is linearly influenced by the true reputation distribution, we prove that the optimal reputation update rule is to choose the mildest possible punishment. This result is further confirmed for higher order beliefs in simulations. Comment: 24 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

Once we have a model in either calculus, one can transform it to the other by means of a suitable transformation.

40|$|AbstractIn general, {{combining}} Dempster-Shafer <b>belief</b> <b>functions</b> over a {{frame of}} n elements {{is a problem with}} exponential time complexity in n. This is a consequence of an exponential number of focal elements being generated when the focal elements of the <b>belief</b> <b>functions</b> being combined intersect. In order to avoid this undesirable behavior, we must impose some special structure on the focal sets. Our approach is to work with families of subsets that are closed under intersection. Hence, we present four polynomial time algorithms for combining some particular types of <b>belief</b> <b>functions.</b> In the first case, the case of <b>Bayesian</b> <b>belief</b> <b>functions,</b> we exploit the result that if any <b>belief</b> <b>function</b> is <b>Bayesian,</b> then the resulting <b>belief</b> <b>function</b> is also <b>Bayesian.</b> Thus the resulting <b>belief</b> <b>function</b> has no more than n focal elements. In the second case, the special case of polytomic <b>belief</b> <b>functions</b> over the same partition, we exploit the fact that no new focal elements are created. In the case of exact polytomic <b>belief</b> <b>functions,</b> we exploit the fact that the resulting <b>belief</b> <b>function</b> is also exact polytomic, with no more than n focal sets. Finally, in the case of hierarchical <b>belief</b> <b>functions,</b> we exploit the fact that the resulting <b>belief</b> <b>function</b> has the same hierarchy...|$|R

It is demonstrated that Zhu and Lee's {Zhu: 93 } logical networks and Smets' {Smets: 93 } directed acyclic graphs are unable to capture statistical dependence/independence of bayesian networks {Pearl: 88 }. On the other hand, though Shenoy and Shafer's hypergraphs can explicitly represent bayesian network factorization of <b>bayesian</b> <b>belief</b> <b>functions,</b> they disclaim any need for representation of independence of variables in <b>belief</b> <b>functions.</b> Cano et al. {Cano: 93 } reject the hypergraph representation of Shenoy and Shafer just on grounds of missing representation of variable independence, but in their frameworks some <b>belief</b> <b>functions</b> factorizable in Shenoy/Shafer framework cannot be factored. The approach in {Klopotek: 93 f} on the other hand combines the merits of both Cano et al. and of Shenoy/Shafer approach in that for Shenoy/Shafer approach no simpler factorization than that in {Klopotek: 93 f} approach exists and on the other hand all independences among variables captured in Cano et al. framework and many more are captured in {Klopotek: 93 f} approach. %Comment: 1994 internal repor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Dempster–Shafer (DS) {{theory is}} a {{powerful}} tool for probabilistic reasoning based on a formal calculus for combining evidence. DS theory has been widely used in computer science and engineering applications, but has yet to reach the statistical mainstream, perhaps because the DS <b>belief</b> <b>functions</b> do not satisfy long-run frequency properties. Recently, two of the authors proposed an extension of DS, called the weak belief (WB) approach, that can incorporate desirable frequency properties into the DS framework by systematically enlarging the focal elements. The present paper reviews and extends this WB approach. We present a general description of WB in the context of inferential models, its interplay with the DS calculus, and the maximal belief solution. New applications of the WB method in two high-dimensional hypothesis testing problems are given. Simulations show that the WB procedures, suitably calibrated, perform well compared to popular classical methods. Most importantly, the WB approach combines the probabilistic reasoning of DS with the desirable frequency properties of classical statistics.

The uncertainty about the random message in the first stage is assumed to be probabilized, in agreement with the Bayesian principles. For the uncertainty in the second stage no probabilities are given. The <b>Bayesian</b> and <b>belief</b> <b>function</b> approaches part ways in the processing of uncertainty in the second stage.

40|$|An often {{mentioned}} obstacle {{for the use}} of Dempster-Shafer {{theory for}} the handling of uncertainty in expert systems is the computational complexity of the theory. One cause of this complexity is the fact that in Dempster-Shafer theory the evidence is represented by a <b>belief</b> <b>function</b> which is induced by a basic probability assignment, i. e. a probability measure on the powerset of possible answers to a question, and not by a probability measure on the set of possible answers to a question, like in a Bayesian approach. In this paper, we define a Bayesian approximation of a <b>belief</b> <b>function</b> and show that combining the <b>Bayesian</b> approximations of <b>belief</b> <b>functions</b> is computationally less involving than combining the <b>belief</b> <b>functions</b> themselves, while in many practical applications replacing the <b>belief</b> <b>functions</b> by their <b>Bayesian</b> approximations will not essentially affect the result...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a credal {{representation}} of the set of interval probabilities associated with a <b>belief</b> <b>function,</b> and show how it relates to several classical <b>Bayesian</b> transformations of <b>belief</b> <b>functions</b> through the notion of “focus ” of a pair of simplices. Starting from the interpretation of the pignistic function as the center of mass of the credal set of consistent probabilities, we prove that relative belief and plausibility of singletons and intersection probability can be described as foci of different pairs of simplices in the simplex of all probability measures. Such simplices are associated with the lower and upper probability constraints, respectively. This paves the way for the formulation of frameworks similar to the transferable belief model for lower, upper, and interval constraints...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDiagnostics and prognostics {{of health}} states are {{important}} {{activities in the}} maintenance process strategy of dynamical systems. Many approaches {{have been developed for}} this purpose and we particularly focus on data-driven methods which are increasingly applied due to the availability of various cheap sensors. Most data-driven methods proposed in the literature rely on probability density estimation. However, when the training data are limited, the estimated parameters are no longer reliable. This is particularly true for data in faulty states which are generally expensive and difficult to obtain. In order to solve this problem, we propose to use the theory of <b>belief</b> <b>functions</b> as described by Dempster, Shafer (Theory of Evidence) and Smets (Transferable Belief Model).

40|$|Abstract: Several {{mathematical}} {{models have}} been proposed for the modelling of someone's degrees of belief. The oldest is the Bayesian model that uses probability functions. The upper and lower probabilities (ULP) model, Dempster's model, the evidentiary value model (EVM) and the probability of modal propositions somehow generalize the Bayesian approach. The transferable belief model (TBM) is based on other premises and uses <b>belief</b> <b>functions.</b> None of these models is THE best: {{each has its own}} domain of application. We spell out through examples what are the underlying hypotheses that lead to the selection of an adequate model for a given problem. We give indications on how to choose the appropriate model. The major discriminating criterion is: if there exists a probability measure with known values, use the Bayesian model, if there exists a probability measure but with some unknown values, use the ULP models, if the existence of a probability measure is not known, use the TBM. Dempster's model is essentially a special case of ULP model. The EVM and the probability of modal propositions (provability, necessity [...] .) corresponds to a special use of the <b>Bayesian</b> model.
