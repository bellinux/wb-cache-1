25|$|The {{yellowstripe scad}} is an {{important}} species for commercial and subsistence fisheries throughout its range. Between 1990 and 2010 the FAO reported worldwide catch has ranged between 113,000 and 195,000 t, with a consistent trend towards higher catches. These statistics only include Indonesia, Malaysia and the UAE, suggesting true catch sizes to be higher. Of the countries that report catches to the FAO, Indonesia takes the highest amount, with between 129,000 t and 180,000 t reported each year between 2000 and 2010. Locally yellowstripe scad make up {{a high percentage of}} the catch; in an Indian example, it accounted for up to 36% of total landings in one survey. However, in India overall, yellowstripe scad makes up only 1.5% of total carangid catches. The species is predominantly taken in trawls, however is also caught by gill net, <b>bag</b> <b>net,</b> purse seines or ring nets, and push nets. The species is most abundant during spawning periods in India and consists of 8–13cm individuals. A study on the population dynamics in an Indian fishery during 1994 found there was low fishing pressure on the stocks, however a later assessment found stocks elsewhere in India to be overexploited. The novel use of hydroacoustic sounding to estimate the school size of yellowstripe scad, as well as other scad species, has been trialled with varying levels of effectiveness.|$|E

5000|$|Most of {{the major}} fishing {{companies}} were based at Newlyn, with boats at Mullion. They {{were part of the}} Mounts Bay fishing industry. The names have now long disappeared, but some are still remembered: Bolitho, Leah, William Thomas, the Union and Gull boats employed by Trehair, [...] "Mullion Friends", Coulson and Company, the [...] "United Seining Company", [...] "The Happy Return" [...] employed by Edward Batten, Mullion [...] "Covers", Mullion [...] "Rovers", the [...] "Union". The Seine Boats were heavy oak craft 30 to 40 ft long. They weighed up to 30 tons, and were rowed by six crewmen. In addition the crew included two Net Shooters and a bowman. The boats were directed to the pilchard shoals by the Huer and enclosed by circling them with the nets. At Mullion each boat had an [...] "area of ground" [...] whereby the crew had to cast their nets and complete the enclosure of the shoal or part of the shoal as they drifted. These areas or [...] "Stems" [...] as they were called were marked out on land by large posts in the ground on the cliffside and there was a responsibility to complete the enclosure between the two designated markers before retiring and allowing the next boat to come in and cast their net. This was to prevent arguments. The Net Shooters had the extra responsibility of paying out the nets in an accurate manner without tangling and at the direction of the Master Seiner. The bowman provided additional assistance. A second boat, called the [...] "Volyer" [...] or [...] "Follower", carried the [...] "Tuck Net" [...] which was used to remove the fish from the seine net. The [...] "Tuck Net was the equivalent of a large <b>bag</b> <b>net</b> which made it possible to transfer smaller quantities of fish at a time from the Seine Net to waiting boats before transfer ashore. A smaller boat, called the [...] "Lurker" [...] or [...] "Cock Boat", contained the Master Seiner. The fine mesh Seine Nets, cleaned or barked after each use weighed up to 3 tons each and could be 1200 feet (360 m) long and 60-70 feet (about 20 metres) deep. They were then brought ashore, where they were [...] "baulked" [...] with salt in fish cellars and later casked and transported abroad by the merchants across the Mounts Bay.|$|E
40|$|March 5 - 6, 2009, Bangkok, ThailandTo reduce {{incidental}} {{mortality of}} sea turtles in a pound net, a new releasing system {{was developed to}} allow turtles {{to escape from the}} <b>bag</b> <b>net.</b> The turtle releasing device with flapped vent has already been developed for small-scaled pound nets, but seems ineffective for large-scaled pound nets because the turtles rarely encounter the device in a large <b>bag</b> <b>net.</b> This study examined the validity of the sloping upper panel for guiding sea turtle to the releasing device in the <b>bag</b> <b>net.</b> Tank experiments were performed with three types of experimental bag nets: a box-shaped net with horizontal upper panel, one with square-pyramid shaped upper panels of 10 degrees (10 degrees slope net), and square-pyramid shaped <b>bag</b> <b>net</b> with upper panel of 20 degrees (20 degrees slope net). Five loggerheads in captivity (SCL: 42. 8 cm- 50. 0 cm) were prepared. The turtle swam around after entering the <b>bag</b> <b>net,</b> and about five minutes later it started to push its head up against the upper panel. In the 20 degrees slope net, the turtle moved to the shallowest space of the net. This suggested that the sloping upper panel guided the loggerhead turtle to the releasing device in the <b>bag</b> <b>net</b> of a largescaled pound net...|$|E
40|$|Postlarval {{and small}} {{juvenile}} Penaeus merguiensis were sampled fortnightly by beam trawls on the ebb tides over 4 {{years in the}} Matang mangroves {{on the west coast}} of peninsular Malaysia. Larger juveniles were sampled by <b>bag</b> <b>nets</b> on both the ebb and flood tides every fortnight over 5 years. Rainfall is consistently high throughout the year (> 100 mm in each month) and the annual rainfall ranges from about 1, 800 to 2, 600 mm. Water temperatures ranged from 27 °C to 36 °C and salinity from 14 ‰ to 32 ‰ during this study. Fortnightly catches by beam trawls and <b>bag</b> <b>nets</b> were highly variable but showed a single broad period of postlarval and juvenile recruitment extending from December to May and an extended broad period of juvenile emigration from February to July. Beam trawl catches of postlarvae and juvenile prawns were consistently low between June and August. Higher catches of postlarvae and juveniles were recorded at two sites in close proximity to small adjoining creeks than one with no adjacent creek. Catches of juveniles in <b>bag</b> <b>nets</b> were higher during the day than the night and were correlated with the strength of the water flow. Environmental variables generally accounted for only a small proportion of the variation in catches, even for rainfall. The small proportion of variation explained by environmental variables is probably because of their relatively small seasonal variation in the Matang region. The lack of environmental influence on the catches of P. merguiensis implies that managing the mangrove nursery habitats and fishing pressure may be the main considerations for sustaining their stocks in the Matang region...|$|R

40|$|February 23 - 25, 2010, Phuket, ThailandWe {{developed}} a new releasing system to allow turtles to escape spontaneously from underwater <b>bag</b> <b>net</b> of set nets. This system consists of a turtle releasing device (TRD) which is a square vent (1 m x 1 m) with a flap and a 20 degrees sloping upper panel of the <b>bag</b> <b>net.</b> In this study, we examined the behavior of sea turtles in the experimental <b>bag</b> <b>net</b> and escaping capability through the TRD. The experimental <b>bag</b> <b>net</b> was composed of quadratic-prism shaped upper panels of 20 degrees angle on a box-shaped net (8 m x 8 m, 1. 8 m high in total) and the TRD attached {{on the top of}} the upper panel. Eleven captive loggerhead, six wild green, and twelve captive hawksbill turtles were used. All the loggerhead and green turtles and about half the hawksbill turtles successfully escaped out through the TRD. Loggerhead turtles reached the TRD by pushing their heads up continuously, while green and hawksbill turtles swam to the shallowest position directly along the upper panel and reached the TRD. All loggerhead and green turtles pushed up the flap strongly and escaped out successfully, while half of the hawksbill turtles didn’t push the flap strongly enough to open it...|$|E

Four green turtles (SSCL: 58. 1 - 71. 2 cm) were applied. Behaviour of each green turtle in the net was recorded by an underwater video camera, and the number and duration of successive pushing-up behaviours were confirmed. Detection of pushing-up behaviour was attempted by filtering the time series attitude angle and the ODBA (Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration) of the turtle which were converted from the static surge acceleration or the tri-axial dynamic acceleration. The total number of pushing-up behaviours was 38 times and the total duration was 284 seconds. The most accurate threshold of 35 degrees in attitude angle and 2. 0 m/s 2 in ODBA detected 82 % of all the pushing-up behaviours although it contained non pushing-up behaviours such as quick changes in swimming direction.
