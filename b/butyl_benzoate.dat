40|$|A {{series of}} chloro - {{substituted}} 4 -(ethenyloxy) <b>butyl</b> <b>benzoate</b> and acetate monomers were polymerized in toluene at - 20 and 4 o C using an HCl etherate / ethylaluminum dichloride (EtAlCl 2) initiator {{system in the}} presence and absence of an externally added esters. The systems were evaluated in accordance with established criteria to determine the degree of “livingness” of each system in the presence and absence of the added ester. The effects of the enchainment of the of the ester moiety was studied by comparison with the polymerization characteristics of 4 -(ethenyloxy) butane in the presence and absence of the externally added ester corresponding to the enchained ester moiety. The effect of the “intramolecular” ester on the living nature of the system was studied and {{it was determined that}} the enchained ester moiety is less effective in inducing a living system than the equivalent ester added externally. Further, it was determined that the degree to which an enchained or externally added ester is able to induce “livingness” in a system is directly proportional to the pKa of the conjugate carboxylic acid of the ester...|$|E
40|$|Restricted Access. We report high {{pressure}} studies on a binary system of 4 -(2 '-methyl butyl) phenyl 4 '-n-octyl biphenyl- 4 -carboxylate (CE 8 from BDH) and 4 -n- dodecyloxy biphenyl- 4 '-(2 '-methyl <b>butyl)</b> <b>benzoate</b> (C 12). For the concentration range 0. 32 <X< 0. 62, where X is the weight fraction of C 12, the system shows the following sequence of transitions at room pressure: Isotropic- Cholesteric (Ch) -Twist Grain Boundary (TGB) -Smectic A (A) Smectic C- (C*). For X= 0. 25, the Ch phase transforms {{directly to the}} A phase at 1 bar, {{but there is an}} induced TGB phase between the Ch and A phases at elevated pressures. Analysis of the topology of the pressure-temperature diagram {{in the vicinity of the}} Ch-TGB-A meeting point indicates that is a critical end point rather than a bicritical point as expected from the mean field theory. At X= 0. 64 there is a direct TGB-C* transition at 1 bar, but there appears a pressure induced A phase between the TGB and C* phases. The topology of the phase diagram suggests that the TGB-A-C* meeting point is a bicritical point...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{structure}} and dynamics of pure and mixed liquid aromatic esters is studied through microwave dielectric relaxation spectroscopy in the 200 MHz – 20 GHz frequency range. Methyl, ethyl, propyl and <b>butyl</b> <b>benzoate</b> were studied at 298. 15 K to infer the alkylic chain length effect on solvents properties {{showing that the}} relaxational behaviour for the four esters is properly described with a single Debye type function for the considered range. Methylbenzoate behaviour was also analyzed in the 278. 15 – 358. 15 K temperature range to study the temperature effect on their properties. Experiments on phenyl acetate were carried out to analyze the effect of aromatic ring position on fluid structure. We have also considered the properties at 298. 15 K of different methylbenzoate containing mixed fluids with n-hexane, cyclohexane, 1 -chlorohexane, 1 -hexanol, hexanoic acid and diisopropyl ether to study the effect of different functional groups on fluid structure upon mixing. All the binary mixtures studied are properly described using a bimodal Debye process in the whole composition range. Data are analyzed {{in terms of the}} proposed different species present in the fluids and their evolution with composition for mixtures, and with temperature and chain length for pure esters.

40|$|Studies of the {{migration}} of benzophenone from inks and of model ink components incorporated deliberately into cartonboard {{have been carried out}} at low temperature and during microwave heating. Benzophenone was found in the packaging of four of seven frozen foods examined and this was attributed to its use as a photoinitiator for UV-cured ink. Benzophenone was found to migrate to the packaged food even from polyethylene-coated board, and this was attributed in part to the fact that polyethylene is rather permeable to low molecular weight substances and is not a good barrier to migration. Additional studies were conducted with two other frozen foods by incorporating model ink components into their cartonboard packaging. The substances were benzophenone, benzylbutyl phthalate, <b>butyl</b> <b>benzoate,</b> chlorodecane and dimethyl phthalate. Migration was readily detected after storing the food at - 20 °C for 1 week in the impregnated cartonboard. Migration levels in the food increased only slowly thereafter, up to 1 year, except for the most volatile substances used. Subsequent heating of the frozen food using a microwave oven decreased the concentration of some migrants by volatilization, but increased the concentration of other, less volatile substances by heat-accelerated migration. It is concluded that for inks used to print food contact materials, if the content of low molecular weight volatiles is controlled and if transfer of higher molecular weight components via set-off is controlled also, then migration levels could be kept low in these conditions...|$|E
