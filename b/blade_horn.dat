40|$|The {{morphology}} of cornified structures {{is notoriously}} difficult to analyse {{because of the}} extreme range of hardness of their component tissues. Hence, a correlative approach using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, three-dimensional reconstructions based on x-ray computed tomography data, and graphic modeling was applied to study the morphology of the cornified claw sheath of the domesticated cat {{as a model for}} cornified digital end organs. The highly complex architecture of the cornified claw sheath is generated by the living epidermis that is supported by the dermis and distal phalanx. The latter is characterized by an ossified unguicular hood, which overhangs the bony articular base and unguicular process of the distal phalanx and creates an unguicular recess. The dermis covers the complex surface of the bony distal phalanx but also creates special structures, such as a dorsal dermal papilla that points distally and a curved ledge on the medial and lateral sides of the unguicular process. The hard-cornified external coronary horn and proximal cone horn form the root of the cornified claw sheath within the unguicular recess, which is deeper on the dorsal side than on the medial and lateral sides. As a consequence, their rate of horn production is greater dorsally, which contributes to the overall palmo-apical curvature of the cornified claw sheath. The external coronary and proximal cone horn is worn down through normal use as it is pushed apically. The hard-cornified apical cone horn is generated by the living epidermis enveloping the base and free part of the dorsal dermal papilla. It forms nested horn cones that eventually form the core of the hardened tip of the cornified claw. The sides of the cornified claw sheath are formed by the newly described hard-cornified <b>blade</b> <b>horn,</b> which originates from the living epidermis located on the slanted face of the curved ledge. As the <b>blade</b> <b>horn</b> is moved apically, it entrains and integrates the hard-cornified parietal horn on its internal side. It is covered by the external coronary and proximal cone horn on its external side. The soft-cornified terminal horn extends distally from the parietal horn and covers the dermal claw bed {{at the tip of the}} uniguicular process, thereby filling the space created by the converging apical cone and <b>blade</b> <b>horn.</b> The soft-cornified sole horn fills the space between the cutting edges of <b>blade</b> <b>horn</b> on the palmar side of the cornified claw sheath. The superficial soft-cornified perioplic horn is produced on the internal side of the unguicular pleat, which surrounds the root of the cornified claw sheath. The shedding of apical horn caps is made possible by the appearance of microcracks in the superficial layers of the external coronary and proximal cone horn in the course of deformations of the cornified claw sheath, which is subjected to tensile forces during climbing or prey catching. These microcracks propagate tangentially through the coronary horn and do not injure the underlying living epidermal and dermal tissues. This built-in shedding mechanism maintains sharp claw tips and ensures the freeing of the claws from the substrate...|$|E
50|$|All weapon classes from {{previous}} games (Great Sword, Long Sword, Sword and Shield, Dual <b>Blades,</b> Hammer, Hunting <b>Horn,</b> Lance, Gunlance, Switch Axe, Light Bowgun, Heavy Bowgun and Bow) {{are present in}} the game. The four classes which were not present in Tri (Dual <b>blades,</b> Hunting <b>Horn,</b> Gunlance and Bow) have been revised. The equipment creation and fortification systems received a variety of changes. Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto claimed that this area of the game will keep what was good from Monster Hunter Freedom Unite and Monster Hunter Tri and add new elements.|$|R

40|$|Analytical {{studies were}} {{performed}} to ascertain the feasibility of reducing helicopter rotor induced 4 /rev vibratory forces by means of multicyclic flap control input on a dual control, four bladed rotor system. The dual control consisted of a primary inboard pitch <b>horn</b> <b>blade</b> control and a secondary outboard flap control. Flap control was put in at frequencies greater than the rotor rotational speed...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a cooperative research program joined by ZF Luftfahrttechnik GmbH (ZFL), NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), and Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC) it was agreed to develop and manufacture a fullscale UH- 60 Individual Blade Control (IBC) system to be installed in the LRTA and tested in the NASA National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex. The LRTA is NASA’s new Large Rotor Test Apparatus which was designed to test helicopter and tilt rotors in the 40 - by 80 -foot and 80 - by 120 -foot Wind Tunnels. The objectives of the UH- 60 IBC wind tunnel test program were to demonstrate the feasibility of the IBC system and to quantify the benefits to be gained when applied to and operated with a UH- 60 main rotor. This paper describes the UH- 60 IBC system engineering design, development, manufacturing, and component testing conducted by ZFL. The servo-hydraulic IBC actuators to be installed between the swashplate and <b>blade</b> pitch <b>horn</b> were designed to withstand the control forces produced by a full-scale UH- 60 rotor in a centrifugal field of up to 40 g. They were designed to produce up to ± 6. 0 deg blade pitch motion at the 2 /rev frequency, diminishing to ± 1. 6 deg at the 7 /rev frequency. A set of actuator test specimens was manufactured and fatigue tested with simulation of the control forces and centrifugal load. Prior to the 80 - by 120 -foot wind tunnel testing, that was concluded by the end of September 2001, the complete IBC system was functionally tested (non-rotating and rotating, blades off). This paper discusses the IBC system integration issues as well as the test stand set-up used for actuator and system level testing...|$|R
40|$|A {{full-scale}} {{wind tunnel}} test was recently conducted (March 2009) in the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) 40 - by 80 -FootWind Tunnel to evaluate the potential of an individual blade control (IBC) system to improve rotor performance and reduce vibrations, loads, and noise for a UH- 60 A rotor system [1]. This test {{was the culmination of}} a long-termcollaborative effort between NASA, U. S. Army, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, and ZF Luftfahrttechnik GmbH (ZFL) to demonstrate the benefits of IBC for a UH- 60 Arotor. Figure 1 shows the UH- 60 Arotor and IBC system mounted on the NFAC Large Rotor Test Apparatus (LRTA). The IBC concept used in the current study utilizes actuators placed in the rotating frame, one per blade. In particular, the pitch link of the rotor blade was replacedwith an actuator, so that the blade root pitch can be changed independently. This concept, designed for a full-scale UH- 60 A rotor, was previously tested in the NFAC 80 - by 120 -FootWind Tunnel in September 2001 at speeds up to 85 knots [2]. For the current test, the same UH- 60 A rotor and IBC system were tested in the 40 - by 80 -FootWind Tunnel at speeds up to 170 knots. Figure 2 shows the servo-hydraulic IBC actuator installed between the swashplate and the <b>blade</b> pitch <b>horn.</b> Although previous wind tunnel experiments [3, 4] and analytical studies on IBC [5, 6] have shown the promise to improve the rotor s performance, in-depth correlation studies have not been performed. Thus, the current test provides a unique resource {{that can be used to}} assess the accuracy and reliability of prediction methods and refine theoretical models, with the ultimate goal of providing the technology for timely and cost-effective design and development of new rotors. In this paper, rotor performance and loads calculations are carried out using the analyses CAMRAD II and coupled OVERFLOW- 2 /CAMRAD II and the results are compared with these UH- 60 A/IBC {{wind tunnel test}} data...|$|R
