40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, I {{investigated}} the inter- and intraspecific {{variation in the}} Silene vulgaris/uniflora species-complex (the <b>bladder</b> <b>campions).</b> I {{have focused on the}} effects of past and present hybridization both on a large scale ? over the whole of Europe ? and on a local scale. Silene vulgaris and S. uniflora are perennial herbs and they are interfertile. The results from my studies suggest that hybridization between the closely-related species S. vulgaris and S. uniflora has influenced the evolution of both species in Europe. There is evidence for both ancient (predating the most recent postglacial migrations) and recent (local) gene flow between species and populations. The patterns of variation exhibited in allozyme and chloroplast DNA markers indicate considerable mixing of alleles and haplotypes and it is not possible, from the present results alone, to identify the source areas (refugia) from which northern Europe was recolonized during the postglacial period. On the Baltic island of Öland, a strong paternal effect on seed germination and germination time, in combination with differences in habitat preference, appear to constitute a strong barrier against hybridization and gene flow between the weedy S. vulgaris and the endemic S. uniflora ssp. petraea. My results are congruent with the hypothesis that the endemic subspecies S. uniflora ssp. petraea may have evolved as a result of hybridization between S. vulgaris and S. uniflora ssp. uniflora. It is further suggested that S. vulgaris ssp. glareosa and S. vulgaris ssp. prostrata (from S. Europe) may be better regarded as subspecies within S. uniflora, while S. vulgaris ssp. angustifolia should be retained within S. vulgaris...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of a broader project that {{examines}} three different approaches to evaluating trace metal contamination in urban brownfields: the measure of total soil metals; calculating bioavailable metals; and the use of species as bioindicators of trace metals in soils. Chapter 1 discusses the problems inherent in each approach such as; inconsistent results due to differences in techniques, extrapolation from laboratory to field, and the influence of species differences and environmental conditions. Chapter 2 is a site description measuring biodiversity, community structure and activity of three urban brownfields. The site description was used to select organisms that were subsequently evaluated for their usefulness as bioindicators of trace metals (chapter 3). Of the three plant species used (dandelion, <b>bladder</b> <b>campion,</b> and chicory), dandelion has the possibility of being a suitable bioindicator of Cd, Ni, and Zn, while <b>bladder</b> <b>campion</b> may be suitable for evaluating Cd, Ni, Pb, and Zn...|$|E
40|$|Although plasmid-like {{mitochondrial}} DNA molecules {{have been}} investigated {{in a number of}} cultivated plant species, knowledge about their occurrence and behavior in natural plant populations is scarce. In the <b>bladder</b> <b>campion,</b> Silene vulgaris, a common weed of northern Europe, mt-plasmids of three different sizes were detected in a survey of S. vulgaris populations in southern Sweden. Two of the three plasmids usually occurred together within individual plants and showed large variation in frequency between populations. From F-ST-estimates of plasmids, mitochondrial markers, and nuclear markers it was concluded that the plasmids are predominantly maternally inherited in their natural habitat, as observed in greenhouse experiments. The association between mt-plasmids and mitochondrial haplotype was strong, but not complete, in the natural material. These results indicate that the mt-plasmids of S. vulgaris have evolved toward almost strict maternal inheritance...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the transmission properties and the phenotypic effects of two mitochondrial plasmids {{in a population}} of the <b>bladder</b> <b>campion,</b> Silene vulgaris. In reciprocal crosses between plasmid-free and plasmid-carrying plants, no cases of paternal transmission or loss during maternal transmission were recorded. Neither was any transmission via pollen observed when plasmid-carrying plants of S, vulgaris were used to pollinate plasmid-free plants of the closely related species Silene uniflora. The phenotypic effects of the plasmids were investigated by comparing germination rate, early growth properties, and the gender of plants grown from seeds with and without plasmids. A significant association between plasmid status, on the one hand, and germination propensity and offspring gender, on the other, was found. However, because all plants carrying plasmids in the experiment shared the same cytoplasmic background, the exact contribution of the plasmid to the phenotypic variation could not be determined. Taken together, our experiments show that in S. vulgaris the mt-plasmids are not currently involved in any strong genetic conflict, but that they evolve in close association with their mitochondrial host...|$|E
40|$|Accurate gene {{expression}} measurements are essential {{in studies of}} both crop and wild plants. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) has become a preferred tool for {{gene expression}} estimation. A selection of suitable reference genes for the normalization of transcript levels is an essential prerequisite of accurate RT-qPCR results. We evaluated the expression stability of eight candidate reference genes across roots, leaves, flower buds and pollen of Silene vulgaris (<b>bladder</b> <b>campion),</b> a model plant {{for the study of}} gynodioecy. As random priming of cDNA is recommended for the study of organellar transcripts and poly(A) selection is indicated for nuclear transcripts, we estimated gene expression with both random-primed and oligo(dT) -primed cDNA. Accordingly, we determined reference genes that perform well with oligo(dT) - and random-primed cDNA, making it possible to estimate levels of nucleus-derived transcripts in the same cDNA samples as used for organellar transcripts, a key benefit in studies of cyto-nuclear interactions. Gene expression variance was estimated by RefFinder, which integrates four different analytical tools. The SvACT and SvGAPDH genes were the most stable candidates across various organs of S. vulgaris, regardless of whether pollen was included or not...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that vacuolar compartmentation might {{play an important}} role in naturally selected cadmium tolerance in Silene vulgaris (Moench.) Garcke (<b>Bladder</b> <b>campion).</b> Additionally, a tendency of heavy metals to accumulate in the epidermis has been reported. Since these factors would affect the distribution of cadmium in leaves, we determined the distribution of cadmium in leaves of cadmium tolerant and sensitive ecotypes of Silene vulgaris at different levels of exposure and at different time intervals. Cadmium concentrations were higher in leaves of sensitive plants than in those of cadmium tolerant ones after identical exposure to cadmium for a period of 8 days. The highest cadmium concentrations were found in the lower epidermis of plants of both ecotypes. The amount of cadmium located at the lower epidermis was highest for sensitive plants, although the stomatal density was lower in the sensitive ecotype than in the tolerant one. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is the weak relationship between transpiration (water flow) and element allocation. Our results support the hypothesis that vacuolar storage of cadmium plays an important role in the mechanism of cadmium tolerance in Silene vulgaris...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{like all}} other {{eukaryotic}} organisms carry most of their DNA in the nucleus. In addition, plants also have both chloroplasts and mitochondria that contain their own genetic material. The genomes in chloroplasts and mitochondria control certain vital processes, but most often the organelles act under strict nuclear control. Usually the nuclear and organellar genomes live in "harmony", promoting themselves by helping each other. The mitochondrial and nuclear genomes can, however, sometimes {{end up in a}} conflict of interest. Cytoplasmic male sterility, is an example, where such a conflict may arise; in this case over the sexual development of carrier plants. A factor complicating the organization and control of the genetic material in plants even more, is the existence of mitochondrial plasmids. Mitochondrial plasmids have been reported to show deviations from strict maternal inheritance and to have effects on the sexual development of their carriers. These extrachromosomal genetic elements can be regarded as a third level of genome organization. In plants carrying mitochondrial plasmids conflicts of interest are therefore possible between three genetic actors: the chromosomes in the nucleus, the mitochondrial genome, and the plasmid DNA/RNA. Theoretical models were set up to extend our understanding of how such conflicts can develop and to study which parameters are of importance for the spread and maintenance of mitochondrial plasmids in plant populations. They show that some degree of paternal transmission via pollen is important for the spread of mitochondrial plasmids. The analyses also show that the most likely long-term evolutionary direction is towards plasmids with weak phenotypic effects and a strict maternal mode of transmission. To investigate the parameters for plasmid spread and evolution, we chose to study the naturally occurring weed Silene vulgaris, the <b>bladder</b> <b>campion,</b> a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which carries mitochondrial plasmids. Three different length variants of mitochondrial plasmids of S. vulgaris could be recognized and they were distributed among populations over the whole investigated area of Skåne, the southernmost county of Sweden. The plasmids of S. vulgaris show no deviation from strict maternal inheritance. Neither were any effects detected on their host plants? fitness or sexual development that could be separated from effects caused by the background cytoplasm. The mitochondrial plasmids of S. vulgaris seem to have reached a state of almost perfect maternal transmission and of weak phenotypic effects, as predicted by the models. The existence of male sterility in S. vulgaris cannot be explained by the occurrence of mitochondrial plasmids. However, there is evidence for both cytoplasmic and nuclear genes being involved in sex-determination. In S. vulgaris, as in several other gynodioecious species, so called gynomonoecious (i. e. partially male sterile) individuals are sometimes found. The standard explanation for the occurrence of this third gender is incomplete nuclear restoration of male-sterilizing cytoplasms. Here, an alternative interpretation is given to partial male sterility in S. vulgaris: Heteroplasmy of factors involved in sexual development can produce the mosaic of flowers found in gynomonoecious plants, as well as the differences in gender proportions among offspring from flowers of different types on a single plant...|$|E
