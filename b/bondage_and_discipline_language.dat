50|$|However, the {{majority}} of books in the lesbian paperback fiction genre promoted myths about lesbians and lesbianism. Women who are left without men can be seduced and violated by predatory lesbians (usually butch women). The depictions of lesbianism in prison, the military, and boarding schools was a well-used motif. Lesbianism was often linked to other topics that were seen as salacious or shocking at the time: witchcraft, Satanism, <b>bondage</b> <b>and</b> <b>discipline,</b> orgies, <b>and</b> voyeurism. Many “lesbian” pulps actually depict characters who may now be read as bisexual and who end up in heterosexual relationships {{at the end of}} their stories.

We focus on the lived experience of BDSM participation to further illuminate these sexual practices. A descriptive phenomenological analysis of four interview transcripts was employed, with the purpose of producing a general structural experience of BDSM participation, which aims to further understanding of this complex phenomenon. The essential structures of the BDSM experience are discussed in terms of authentic fantasy, rejection of social norms and non-sexual positive outcomes...|$|R

The study is based on 29 in-depth interviews with self-defined BDSM practitioners and ethnographic fieldwork in Swedish BDSM communities. The article shows that there is a strong preoccupation of gender and equality among Swedish practitioners. They express gender awareness and pro- blematise the practice in relation to societal power structures. For BDSM to fit into a society with a strong egalitarian discourse like Sweden, the practitioners need to reconcile BDSM and gender equality. To defend an interest in BDSM, the practitioners emphasise the voluntariness, the central role of consent, and the defined staging in the practices. By highlighting the consent, the informants thus position themselves against the discourse of BDSM as violent, oppressive and patriarchal...|$|R

Data were analysed according to Grounded Theory methodology. Questions concerning the 'normality' or the 'deviance' of participants' sexual practices were reflected in the answers of the majority of BDSM practitioners. Sexuality was construed as a 'game' with specific rules, and 'pleasure' was associated with extremely intense experiences. The relationship between the partners was considered fundamental, as it gave meaning to the sexual practice. Both dominant and dominated roles were found to be tightly linked to the possession and management of power between partners, which either confirms or reverses the social construction of traditional male and female roles...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes how, {{for over}} a century, Spanish novels have used sadomasochism (the derivation of pleasure through physical and/ or psychological pain) to criticize the Catholic Church from an anticlerical position, to denounce Francoism, and to sublimate the political left’s disillusionment with the post-Franco democratic era into an alternative sexual revolution. First, in the introduction, I review sadomasochism theory, both international and Spanish. Next, chapter one shows how Armando Palacio Valdés’s Marta y María (1883), Emilia Pardo Bazán’s Dulce Dueño (1911), and Victor Ripalda’s El pájaro azul (c. 1930) use “holy sadomasochism” the confluence of religion and sadomasochism, through religious flagellation to promote an anticlerical agenda, especially in relation to women. Chapter two reveals how Juan Marsé’s Si te dicen que caí (Mexico, 1973. Spain, 1976) and Isaac Rosa’s El vano ayer (2004) use representations of sadomasochism in war and politics to denounce Francoism. Chapter three explores {{the possibility of the}} use of BDSM (<b>Bondage</b> <b>and</b> <b>Discipline,</b> Dominance <b>and</b> Submission, Sadism and Masochism) as a sublimation of the left’s desencanto with the democratic era into an alternative sexual revolution in the post-Franco democratic-era erotic novels Pedro Sempere’s Fritzcollage (1982), Almudena Grandes’s Las edades de Lulú (1989), and Luisgé Martín’s La mujer de sombra (2012) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine escort-business with a focus on sales of BDSM-services (<b>Bondage</b> <b>and</b> <b>Discipline,</b> Dominance <b>and</b> Submission, Sadism and Masochism). The study is based on {{qualitative}} interviews with three informants providing BDSM-services, as well as a survey with 96 men who requested domination of escorts (the survey was carried out by an escort in the 1980 s). The analysis of this material resulted in the identification of three themes on which the study centers: The personal experiences of the three escorts, the interaction between the escorts and the clients, and the changes over time when it comes to the performance of BDSM-services. The study has a gender perspective with a focus on feminism and queer-theory. The important conclusions are that there are several differences between prostitution having a focus on BDSM-services and other prostitution. Sexual intercourse is not a common occurrence. Role-playing games involving domination and submission, physical pain, humiliation and fantasies are instead central elements. Due to the security risks submissive services have been assumed not to exist in prostitution. In this study, however, two of the informants present themselves as submissive. Nothing in the empirical material suggests a greater security risk for escorts providing BDSM-services than other sexsellers. Instead, the escorts themselves characterize the phenomenon by straightforwardness, upright communication, and pre-agreed rules of the interaction...|$|R

Studies of the possible impact of legalization mainly have focused on sexually transmitted infections and violence, with little attention {{to change in the}} diversity of sexual services provided. This study examined the practices of sex workers before and after legalization of prostitution. Cross-sectional surveys of comparable samples of female sex workers were conducted in 1991 (N = 200, aged 16 - 46 years) and 2003 (N = 247, aged 18 - 57 years) in Queensland, Australia, spanning a period of major change in regulation of the local industry. In 2003, male clients at brothels and private sole operators (N = 161; aged 19 - 72 years) were also interviewed. Over time, there was a clear increase in the provision of "exotic" sexual services, including <b>bondage</b> <b>and</b> <b>discipline,</b> submission, fantasy, use of sex toys, golden showers, fisting, and lesbian double acts, while "traditional" services mostly remained at similar levels (with substantial decrease in oral sex without a condom). Based on comparisons of self-reports of clients and workers, the demand for anal intercourse, anal play, and urination during sex apparently exceeded supply, especially in licensed brothels. Within this population, legalization of sex work coincided with a substantial increase in diversity of services, but it appears that in the regulated working environments, clients who prefer high risk practices might not dictate what is available to them...|$|R

Methods: A representative sample of 20 094 men and women aged 16 - 69 years (participation rate among eligible people, 66. 2 %) were recruited by landline and mobile phone random-digit dialling and computer-assisted telephone interviews in 2012 - 13. Results: Many respondents (men, 72 %; women, 42 %) had masturbated in the past year. Half (51 %) of the men and 24 % of women had masturbated in the past 4 weeks. In the past year, more than two-fifths of respondents (men, 63 %; women, 20 %) had looked at pornography in any medium. Approximately 15 % of men and 21 % of women had used a sex toy. Digital-anal stimulation with a partner was practised by 19 % of men and 15 % of women, and oral-anal stimulation by 7 % of men and 4 % of women. Sexual role playing or dressing up were engaged in by 7 - 8 %.

40|$|Introduction - The role of {{commercial}} sex in facilitating infection transmission {{is a subject}} of ongoing empirical enquiry, with {{little attention to the}} variety and extent of ‘non-traditional’ commercial services that pose a lesser risk of infection. This study sought to examine the supply and demand {{of a wide range of}} traditional and non-traditional commercial sexual services among sex workers and their clients from Queensland, Australia. Methods - Cross-sectional convenience sampling was used to compare female sex workers in 1991 (n= 200, aged 16 - 46 years) and 2003 (n= 247, aged 18 - 57 years) and from male clients in 2003. The client sample comprised 160 male clients aged between 19 and 72 years. Results - Over the comparison period there was a significant increase in the provision of ‘exotic’ or non-traditional sexual services. In 2003, the availability of <b>bondage</b> <b>and</b> <b>discipline,</b> submission, fantasy, use of sex toys, golden showers, fisting and lesbian double acts had increased dramatically, while ‘traditional’ services had mostly remained at similar levels. Moreover, the proportion of sex workers in some industry sectors providing ‘exotic’ commercial services seem to have risen over time. Conclusion - Undoubtedly, the sex industry has professionalised and now includes more sophisticated and specialized suppliers. As with any commercial business, the diversification of services is largely driven with client demand, with the ‘menu’ being generally broader than the majority of client preferences. However, although clients demands for particular commercial sexual services seems to have been met, with regard to anal sex and anal play, supply has failed to meet client demand.
