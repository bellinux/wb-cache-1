40|$|It is {{well known}} that in fractional-slot {{concentrated}} windings the eddy-current losses in the permanent magnets can be relevant and, for this reason, they must be evaluated in the machine design procedure. The paper investigates the influence of the rotor <b>back-iron</b> resistivity on the rotor eddy-current losses in this machine typology. In particular, a external rotor annulus shape PM machine with fractional-slot non-overlapping concentrated windings is considered. The machine is a scaled representative prototype of starters/generators embedded in aircraft engines. Both the rotor <b>back-iron</b> and permanent magnet eddy-currents are simultaneously considered by means of bi-dimensional transient FEM simulations, including effects of stator slotting, rotor motion and material saturation. The analysis is conducted increasing the rotor <b>back-iron</b> resistivity from an ideal situation of a high-conducting material up to the opposite ideal condition of a non-conducting material. Adjusting the rotor <b>back-iron</b> resistivity, the space MMF harmonic components influence on the machine torque is qualitatively investigated and discussed too...|$|E
40|$|This work is an {{investigation}} into the curvature related potential for flux to flow in the radial direction in the <b>back-iron</b> of laminated axial flux machine cores. Analytical and numerical models are presented. Analysis based on these models has shown that, in practical axial flux machines, the radial component of the flux density can be neglected with respect to the flux density distribution in the core <b>back-iron.</b> It has also been found that if the core permeability, core conductivity and number of poles are sufficiently high then power loss due to curvature related cross-lamination flux is negligible compared to normal eddy current losses. A closed form expression to predict losses due to curvature related radial flux is also presented. This expression allows axial flux machine designers to make quick assessment of the need to consider these losses when designing axial flux machines...|$|E
40|$|The {{secondary}} <b>back-iron</b> plays {{important role}} in performance of single-sided linear induction motors (SLIMs). On one hand, it provides a return path for the primary flux; on the other hand, it is employed as a mechanical support for the secondary sheet. The conductivity of the iron used in the <b>back-iron</b> {{as well as its}} magnetic permeability influence the outputs of the machine, while the magnetic permeability itself is affected by the input frequency and secondary sheet thickness. In this paper, considering all phenomena involved in the SLIM, the output thrust is analytically derived. The normal force is also calculated by using Maxwell equations. Then, the effects of the input frequency and the secondary sheet thickness on the SLIM forces are analyzed. The motor is simulated using 2 D finite element method. Comparing the finite element results with those obtained by analytical analysis confirms the analytical equations derived for the output thrust and the normal force...|$|E

The matrix formulation caters for symmetrical and asymmetrical winding configurations with any phase number, number of layers, varied phase turns, coil pitch and connection. Stator and rotor lamination symmetry, and highly permeable magnetic material are assumed. Torque developed, positive or negative, and stator teeth and <b>back-iron</b> flux can be analysed for any current excitation sequence and shape, involving unipolar, bipolar or {{any combination of}} each current.

40|$|An {{analytical}} procedure for designing mechanical sleeves in surface-mounted High-Speed Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (HS-PMSMs) {{is presented in}} this paper. It {{is based on the}} theory of elastic mechanics and enables the computation of contact pressures between rotor layers (shaft, <b>back-iron,</b> permanent magnets and sleeve) and the Von Mises equivalent stress. The proposed procedure can be combined with the electromagnetic machine analysis, leading to fast and effective HS-PMSM design. This can be accomplished in accordance with different Permanent Magnets (PMs) and/or sleeve materials. Particularly, NdFeB and Ferrite-based PMs are alternatively considered, as well as the employment of Titanium and Carbon-Fiber as sleeve materials. The proposed approach is validated through Finite Element Analysis (FEA), which regards four different HS-PMSM configurations characterized by the same rated power and speed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a linear oscillating generator of cylindrical type for {{hybrid electric vehicle}} application. The focus {{of the study is}} the suggestion of the optimal model and the design rule of the cylindrical linear oscillating generator with permanent magnet in the <b>back-iron</b> translator. The cylindrical topology is achieved using equivalent magnetic circuit considering leakage elements as initial modeling. This topology with permanent magnet in the <b>back-iron</b> translator is described by number of phases and displacement of stroke. For more accurate analysis of an oscillating machine, it will be compared by moving just one-pole pitch forward and backward the thrust of single-phase system and three-phase system. Through the analysis and comparison, a single-phase system of cylindrical topology as the optimal topology is selected. Finally, the detailed design of the optimal topology takes the magnetic saturation effects into account by finite element analysis. Besides, the losses are examined to obtain more accurate results; copper loss in the conductors of machine windings, eddy-current loss of permanent magnet, and iron-loss of specific material of electrical steel. The considerations of thermal performances and mechanical robustness are essential, because they {{have an effect on the}} entire efficiency and the insulations of the machine due to the losses of the high temperature generated in each region of the generator. Besides electric machine with linear oscillating movement requires a support system that can resist dynamic forces and mechanical masses. As a result, the fatigue analysis of shaft is achieved by the kinetic equations. Also, the thermal characteristics are analyzed by the operating frequency in each region. The results of this study will give a very important design rule in the design of linear oscillating machines. It enables us to more accurate machine design and more accurate prediction of machine performances...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, the {{finite element analysis}} validation of a double-stator single-rotor fractional-slot concentrated-winding axial-flux permanent magnet machine with tooth-wound coils. In this particular topology, the flux travels axially through the permanent magnets, from one stator to the opposite, {{so that there is}} no need for any rotor <b>back-iron.</b> In order to guarantee sufficient mechanical stiffness of the rotor, the support of the permanent magnets is made of stainless steel. Three different variants of this support are proposed, with the aim of minimizing the induced losses therein. Machine performances both at no load and at rated load are analyzed by using time-stepped 2 D FEA and losses in the rotor are compared for the different support variants.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, finite element analyses and experimental validation of a Kaman type, fractional-slot concentrated-winding, axial-flux permanent magnet machine with tooth-wound coils. In this particular topology, the flux travels axially through the permanent magnets, from one stator to the opposite, {{so that there}} is no need for any rotor <b>back-iron.</b> Thus, the rotor is an assembly of permanent magnets and a suitably designed holder. In order to guarantee adequate mechanical stiffness, stainless steel has been selected as the holder’s material. Different designs of this holder are investigated, with the aim of minimising the induced losses therein. Both no-load and on-load performances are analysed with 2 D time-stepped FE simulations, with particular attention devoted to rotor losses. A full scale prototype is built, together with two of the previously investigated holder structures. Experimental tests confirm the validity of the design and of the FE simulations...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{modified}} force decoupling method for improved servo {{control of a}} magnetically suspended double-layer single-sided linear induction motor (LIM) is presented. In this study, the primary is magnetically suspended under and moved along the double-layer secondary which consists of an aluminum plate with a <b>back-iron.</b> In order to decoupled the normal and thrust force, analytical expressions for the forces as function of the slip frequency and the primary current are obtained by curve fitting on steady-state FEM results. From these steady-state force models, the required current amplitude and slip frequency are solved for given force setpoints. The setpoints are generated by a position controller which is designed based on a dynamical model of the LIM. The dynamical model is estimated by injecting noise into a transient FE-model and measurements.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} efficiency and mover mass on a double-sided permanent magnet linear synchronous generator (PMLSG) according to its magnetization pattern. When a PMLSG has a lighter mover, it has advantages such as lower cost and other aspects regarding mechanical losses. In general, PMLSGs are used with a vertical PM pattern, but we propose a horizontal PM pattern in this paper because the horizontal PM mover does not need a <b>back-iron</b> for the magnetic path. Electromagnetic field analysis is especially essential when analyzing the characteristics of PMLSGs. For this type of analysis, commercial finite element analysis tools are widely used because they offer convenient user interfaces that provide very accurate analytical results. Based on two-dimensional finite element analysis, we got results for two different patterns and compared them with our experimental results. Finally, {{the results of this}} analysis and the test results obtained confirm the validity of the model and the superiority of the horizontal pattern proposed in this paper...|$|E

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} necessity to improve torque density while simultaneously maintaining high efficiency {{is a constant}} point of concern for electrical machine designers. This is mainly driven by the need for direct-drive solutions in evermore applications. This paper presents a general mesh-free description of the magnetic field distribution in multiple air-gap electromagnetic machines, although the tool is also useful for single air-gap machines, actuators, and other magnetic devices. The used method is based on transfer relations and Fourier theory, which can provide the magnetic field solution for a wide class of 2 -D boundary value problems. This technique is in this paper applied to the rotary multiple air-gap machine with slotless (without slots but with and without rotor <b>back-iron)</b> armature. The presented analysis is compared to finite-element analysis for the multiple-layer winding, which shows the applicability of this method for future optimization. It is shown that multiple air-gap machines make better use of the volume and for short axial lengths where a single-side bearing configuration can be utilized provides a means to improve the achievable torque density...|$|E
40|$|Special {{actuators}} {{are needed}} to control the orientation of large structures in space-based precision pointing systems. Electromagnetic actuators that presently exist are too large in size and their bandwidth is too low. Hydraulic fluid actuation also presents problems for many space-based applications. Hydraulic oil can escape in space and contaminate the environment around the spacecraft. A research study was performed that selected an electrically-powered linear actuator {{that can be used}} to control the orientation of a large pointed structure. This research surveyed available products, analyzed the capabilities of conventional linear actuators, and designed a first-cut candidate superconducting linear actuator. The study first examined theoretical capabilities of electrical actuators and determined their problems with respect to the application and then determined if any presently available actuators or any modifications to available actuator designs would meet the required performance. The best actuator was then selected based on available design, modified design, or new design for this application. The last task was to proceed with a conceptual design. No commercially-available linear actuator or modification capable of meeting the specifications was found. A conventional moving-coil dc linear actuator would meet the specification, but the <b>back-iron</b> for this actuator would weigh approximately 12, 000 lbs. A superconducting field coil, however, eliminates the need for back iron, resulting in an actuator weight of approximately 1000 lbs...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to design a novel magnetic drive and bearing system for a new centrifugal rotary blood pump (CRBP). The drive system consists of two components: (i) permanent magnets within the impeller of the CRBP; and (ii) the driving electromagnets. Orientation of the magnets varies from axial through to 60 ° included out-lean (conical configuration). Permanent magnets replace the electromagnet drive to allow easier characterization. The performance characteristics tested were the axial force of attraction between the stator and rotor at angles of rotational alignment, Ø, and the corresponding torque at those angles. The drive components were tested for various magnetic cone angles, ?. The test was repeated for three backing conditions: (i) non-backed; (ii) steel-cupped; and (iii) steel plate <b>back-iron,</b> performed on an Instron tensile testing machine. Experimental results were expanded upon through finite element and boundary element analysis (BEM). The force/torque characteristics were maximal for a 12 -magnet configuration at 0 ° cone angle with steel-back iron (axial force = 60 N, torque = 0. 375 Nm). BEM showed how introducing a cone angle increases the radial restoring force threefold while not compromising axial bearing force. Magnets in the drive system may be orientated not only to provide adequate coupling to drive the CRBP, but to provide significant axial and radial bearing forces capable of withstanding over 100 m/s 2 shock excitation on the impeller. Although the 12 magnet 0 ° (?) configuration yielded the greatest force/torque characteristic, this was seen as potentially unattractive as this magnetic cone angle yielded poor radial restoring force characteristics...|$|E
