40|$|SFAS 141 (R), Business Combinations, {{includes}} {{significant changes}} to the accounting and disclosure requirements for acquisitions made at less than fair value. Under new rules, acquisition-related gains, asset valuations and shareholders’ equity will be higher in transactions yielding negative goodwill, a financial statement element referred to henceforth as a <b>bargain</b> <b>purchase</b> amount. In years after the acquisition, operating earnings will be reduced as increased asset valuations are amortized or depreciated. Disclosure requirements contained in the revised standard provide financial statement readers with new insights into why firms are able to effect acquisitions at less than fair value. In reviewing 71 acquisitions, we find several reasons {{for the existence of}} such <b>bargain</b> <b>purchase</b> gains, ranging from financial distress of the target, to special characteristics of the acquiring firm, to flaws in the bidding process. These findings have implications for investors, who must analyze <b>bargain</b> <b>purchase</b> transactions, for CFOs and other corporate managers, who must implement the new standard’s provisions, and for regulators, who must determine whether the new standard is being properly applied...|$|R

5000|$|The {{present value}} of the minimum lease {{payments}} (MLP) is {{equal to or greater}} than 90% of the fair market value of leased property. To understand and apply this criterion, you need familiarize yourself with what is included in the minimum lease payments and how the present value is calculated. The minimum lease payments include the minimum rental payments minus any executory cost, the guaranteed residual value, the <b>bargain</b> <b>purchase</b> option, and any penalty for failure to renew or extend the lease. The amount calculated is then discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. However, if the lessee knows the implicit rate used by the lessor and the rate is less than the lessee’s rate, the lessee should use the lessor’s rate to discount the minimum lease payment.|$|R

40|$|During {{the recent}} {{financial}} crisis, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) auctioned {{most of the}} failed banks. A distinguishing character of these failed bank auctions is that the failed banks are sold at discount from the most recent quarter valuation of their reported asset value. A second distinguishing feature of these auctions is that acquirers of these failed banks have frequently reported <b>bargain</b> <b>purchase</b> gain (BPG) compared to regular mergers during the same period. Based on a unique sample of the FDIC-assisted whole-bank transactions in the recent financial crisis, we measure discount using accounting information, investigate what factors lead to larger discount and larger reporting of BPGs, and further {{examine the effects of}} discount on the post-merger performance of the acquiring institutions. Consistent with prior literature, we identify bidding competitiveness and loss sharing agreement as significant determinants. However, DIF reserve ratio, the proxy for the financial condition of the FDIC and relative size between the failed bank and the acquirer, are not found to have significant and consistent relation with discount. As expected, we document that discount can inflate the post-merger profitability of acquirers. Overall, our study provides insights about the intrinsic connection between the discount determinants and the features of the FDIC-assisted failed bank resolution...|$|R

40|$|We {{model and}} compare the {{bargaining}} process between a purchaser of health services, such as a health authority, and a provider (the hospital) in three plausible scenarios: a) the purchaser sets the price, and activity is bargained between the purchaser and the provider: activity bargaining; b) the price is bargained between the purchaser and the provider, but activity is chosen unilaterally by the provider: price bargaining; c) price and activity are simultaneously bargained between the purchaser and the provider: efficient bargaining. We show that: 1) if the bargaining power of the purchaser is high (low), efficient bargaining leads to higher (lower) activity and purchaser's utility, and lower (higher) prices and provider's utility compared to price bargaining. 2) In activity bargaining, prices are lowest, the purchaser's utility is highest and the provider's utility is lowest; activity is generally lowest, but higher than in price bargaining for high bargaining power of the purchaser. 3) If the purchaser has higher bargaining power, this reduces prices and activity in price bargaining, it reduces prices but increases activity in activity bargaining, and it reduces prices but {{has no effect on}} activity in efficient <b>bargaining.</b> <b>bargaining.</b> negotiation. <b>purchasing.</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|During the 1950s, {{the colonial}} {{government}} of Nigeria established local commodity depots {{in many parts}} of the country. The depots served as stores of exchange for goods the government was interested in buying from peasants. The prosperous Western region was one of the world's most prolific producers of cocoa, and the regional government hoped to increase its tax revenues from farmers by regulating the sale of the crop through state-regulated agricultural cooperatives, also known as marketing boards. Most of the products to be sold were to undergo a process of grading, examination, and sometimes <b>bargaining</b> before <b>purchase.</b> Against this backdrop, a farmers' organization was created to represent the interest of the farmers within the new marketing system. Translated from Yoruba, Agbekoya Parapo means [...] "the union of farmers who reject suffering." [...] The association was an heir to an indigenous system of work cooperatives akin to trade unionism and drew on a tradition of occupational guilds that had regulated working standards and policies for centuries in the region. Yoruba workers in various professions traditionally organized themselves into [...] "egbes", peer groups and guilds that protected the interests of their members in situations that required collective action.|$|R

40|$|Convenience {{goods are}} bought without much {{consideration}} or {{effort on the}} part of the consumer. Buyers don't try to get the best <b>bargain</b> when <b>purchasing</b> individual convenience items. Instead, they adapt their store choice habits so that they can expect, on average, good value for money in the long run. Store choice is governed by aggregate information which is received on the price levels of stores. This is embodied in store price images. A store price image is defined in the subsequent paper as a perceived difference between the store's price level and a reference level that consumers expect of stores about which they have no particular information. Store price images are learnt adaptively over time. We propose a theoretical model of store price image adaptation and a two-stage sales response model. According to the latter, a store's price image and advertising determine the number of customers attracted per period. Sales per visit, however, depend only on the prices actually observed in the store. For this sales model, we have studied the optimal price and advertising policy making simple assumptions of cost. Our main interest is the interaction between optimal advertising and price image. It turns out that image improvement is achieved mainly through pricing; increased advertising follows only after the price image has been improved. Therefore, as long as the price image is poor relative to some optimal equilibrium level, a larger portion of the marketing budget should be allocated to lower prices rather than to advertising. In phases where the price image declines towards the equilibrium, however, heavier advertising is profitable. marketing mix, dynamic models, convenience goods, store price image, imperfect information...|$|R
