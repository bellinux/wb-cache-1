5|$|After leaving school, Macartney {{worked for}} a fruit and {{vegetable}} merchant near Sydney's Sussex Street docks, honing his batting skills by practising without pads on a wooden wharf during his lunch <b>break.</b> <b>At</b> this stage in his career, he possessed a copybook technique and defensive style, something he was to discard for an audacious, self-styled and attacking outlook.|$|E

5|$|As cup winners, Napoli {{qualified}} for the 2014 Supercoppa Italiana {{in which they would}} face Serie A champions Juventus. The match had traditionally taken place in August, but Napoli requested it be moved due to their Champions League play-off that month. The fixture was eventually played on 22 December during the league's winter <b>break,</b> <b>at</b> the Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium in Doha, Qatar. It finished 11 after 90 minutes, 22 after extra time, and Napoli won 65 in the penalty shootout.|$|E
5|$|At the Crucible O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Marcus Campbell in {{the last}} 32, Ali Carter {{in the last}} 16, Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals. He reached the final without falling behind even once, and defeated Barry Hawkins 18–12 to win his fifth world title. O'Sullivan's break of 103 in the 15th frame was his 128th century <b>break</b> <b>at</b> the Crucible Theatre, breaking Stephen Hendry's record of 127 Crucible centuries. During the final he extended the record to 131 century breaks. O'Sullivan became the only player to score six century breaks in a World Championship final. He also became only the third player to retain his title at the Crucible after Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry.|$|E
5|$|Born in Harlow, England, Murphy {{began playing}} snooker {{at the age}} of eight after his parents bought him a snooker table for Christmas. He made his first century <b>break</b> <b>at</b> the age of 10 and practised at the Rushden Snooker Centre, where players such as Stephen Hendry, Mark Williams, and Ken Doherty have also played. At the age of 13, he secured a five-year £5,000-a-year {{sponsorship}} deal with the Doc Martens shoe company and stated his ambitions of winning the World Championship and becoming world number one.

5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, {{after the end}} of the Second World War, Hergé was {{continuing}} to produce new instalments of The Adventures of Tintin for the Belgian magazine Tintin, of which he was the artistic director. After completing serialisation of Prisoners of the Sun in April 1949, he ordered his staff to re-serialise one of his old stories, Popol and Virginia, while he took a three-month <b>break.</b> <b>At</b> this point, Hergé was depressed and suffering from a range of physical ailments, including boils and eczema on his hands. Although fed up with The Adventures of Tintin, he felt great pressure on him to continue producing the series for Tintin magazine.|$|E
5|$|In November 1926 the Gangster Squad {{was absorbed}} by the Industrial Squad, with Broderick in command. While {{commander}} of the Industrial Squad, Broderick received acclaim {{for his role in}} quelling an attempted prison <b>break</b> <b>at</b> The Tombs, the Manhattan prison, on November 3, 1926. He faced down two armed convicts, one of them mobster Hyman Amberg, in the Tombs yard after they had already killed two prison officials. Police said that the convicts, who were already wounded, committed suicide as Broderick approached.|$|E
5|$|In an aerotow a powered {{aircraft}} {{is attached}} to a glider with a tow rope. Single-engined light aircraft or motor gliders are commonly used. The tow-plane takes the glider to the height and location requested by the pilot where the glider pilot releases the tow-rope. A weak link is often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the airframe of the tow-plane or the glider. Under extreme loads the weak link will fail before any part of the glider or plane fails. There is a remote chance that the weak link might <b>break</b> <b>at</b> low altitude, and so pilots plan for this eventuality before launching.|$|E

5|$|On October 24, 2006, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Donald and Robert Hughes {{filed a lawsuit}} against Fox Broadcasting Company and the show's executive producer and creator, Paul Scheuring, for copyright infringement, seeking unspecified damages and other costs. They claimed that in 2001, they had sent Fox their manuscript which was based on their own experiences of a prison <b>break</b> <b>at</b> a juvenile facility. In the 1960s, Donald Hughes planned and successfully executed a prison escape for his brother, Robert Hughes, who was wrongfully incarcerated.|$|E

5|$|This match {{featured}} the longest ever first set (and the longest ever tiebreak) in a men's championship match; the 87-minute first set, won by Murray, included four breaks of {{serve in the}} first four games of the match, a 54-shot rally in the sixth game, and the 24-minute tiebreak which lasted up until 12–10; additionally, the tiebreak included two 30-shot rallies. Murray required six set points to win the first set, and required five sets to win the match. Murray said that a toilet <b>break</b> <b>at</b> the end of the fourth set helped him to restore his concentration after Djokovic took the third and fourth sets.|$|E

5|$|A devastating {{outbreak}} of yellow fever struck {{the island of}} Bermuda in April 1864. The island was a major base of operations for Confederate blockade runners, and the epidemic threatened their continued operations there. At the request of Charles Monck, the Governor General of the United Provinces of Canada, Blackburn traveled to Bermuda to aid soldiers and civilians there. Blackburn continued his ministrations until mid-July when he briefly returned to Halifax. The epidemic on the island continued, and Blackburn returned there in September to continue aiding the victims. He remained there until the outbreak abated in mid-October. For his efforts in Bermuda, Blackburn received 100 British pounds and a commendation from Queen Victoria. Although little is known of his actions in Canada {{for the remainder of}} the war, he was rumored to have been part of a plot to incite massive insurrections in New England as a diversion, allowing fellow Confederate agent Thomas Hines to lead a prison <b>break</b> <b>at</b> Camp Douglas in Chicago. When word of the plot was leaked to Union officials, they sent troops to reinforce Boston, Massachusetts, Blackburn's rumored target, quashing his role in the operation.|$|E
5|$|A spine is a sharp, {{needle-like}} structure used {{to inflict}} pain on predators. An {{example of this}} seen in nature is in the Sohal surgeonfish. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine {{on the front of}} each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish. Defensive spines may be detachable, barbed or poisonous. Porcupine spines are long, stiff, <b>break</b> <b>at</b> the tip, and are barbed to stick into a would-be predator. In contrast, the hedgehog's short spines, which are modified hairs, readily bend, and are barbed into the body, so they are not easily lost; they may be jabbed at an attacker.|$|E
5|$|However, {{once on the}} bus, Lisa {{realizes she}} is on the wrong bus and is dropped off in the middle of nowhere. During his lunch <b>break</b> <b>at</b> work, Homer has a {{conversation}} with Lenny and Carl. He tells them that he let Lisa ride the bus alone. Lenny and Carl point out the error of his judgment, and Homer leaves work to go look for her. He heads to the museum and ends up in downtown Springfield. He uses a cherrypicker to get up higher. Homer and Lisa spot each other, but the vehicle's wheels creak backwards and it rolls down a hill. It slides off the edge of a pier at the harbor into a river. Lisa tells the drawbridge operator to close the bridge so Homer can grab on. His head is caught between the two closing halves and he survives with nothing more than a few tire marks across his forehead.|$|E

The Cockayne Syndrome B protein (CSB) (coded for by ERCC6) localizes <b>at</b> double-strand <b>breaks</b> <b>at</b> sites of active transcription, followed by RAD51, RAD51C and RAD52 to carry out homologous recombinational repair using the newly synthesized RNA as a template.|$|R
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} October 9, 2002 and wrapped by March 7, 2003. The quick shoot was only marred by two accidents: as Jack Sparrow steals the Interceptor, {{three of the}} ropes attaching it to the Dauntless did not <b>break</b> <b>at</b> first, {{and when they did}} snap, debris hit Depp's knee, though he was not injured, and the way the incident played out on film made it look like Sparrow merely ducks. A more humorous accident was when the boat Sparrow was supposed to arrive in at Port Royal sank. In October, the crew was shooting scenes at Rancho Palos Verdes, by December they were shooting at Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and in January they were at the cavern set at Los Angeles. The script often changed with Elliott and Rossio on set, with additions such as Gibbs (Kevin McNally) telling Will how Sparrow allegedly escaped from an island – strapping two turtles together with rope made of his back hair – and Pryce was written into the climactic battle to keep some empathy for the audience.|$|E
5|$|The Rosetta Stone is a {{fragment}} of a larger stele. No additional fragments were found in later searches of the Rosetta site. Owing to its damaged state, {{none of the three}} texts is absolutely complete. The top register, composed of Egyptian hieroglyphs, suffered the most damage. Only the last 14 lines of the hieroglyphic text can be seen; all of them are broken on the right side, and 12 of them on the left. The following register of demotic text has survived best; it has 32 lines, of which the first 14 are slightly damaged on the right side. The final register of Greek text contains 54 lines, of which the first 27 survive in full; the rest are increasingly fragmentary due to a diagonal <b>break</b> <b>at</b> the bottom right of the stone.|$|E
5|$|After the Predators' {{regular season}} success in 2005–06, the team bolstered their lineup by {{acquiring}} centre Jason Arnott and winger Jean-Pierre Dumont. In response to Arnott's signing, Kariya {{commented that the}} centre position, as well as size, were weaknesses for the team the previous year, especially when they matched up against the Sharks' top two centres, Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau, in the playoffs. Leading up to the 2006–07 season, the Predators were picked by many analysts in the media (including those from The Globe and Mail and ESPN) to contend for the Stanley Cup. Prior {{to the start of}} the campaign, the Predators announced defenceman Kimmo Timonen as the team's new captain, while naming Kariya and Steve Sullivan as alternates (the two served in that role the previous season, as well, but not on a permanent basis). With Kariya leading the team in scoring, the team boasted the top record in the league by the All-Star <b>break.</b> <b>At</b> the NHL trade deadline, the team further bolstered their lineup by acquiring high-profile centre Peter Forsberg from Philadelphia. Forsberg joined Kariya on the top line, though not consistently. With 76 points (24 goals and 52 assists)—the second highest total in team history—over 82 games, Kariya led the Predators in scoring for a second-straight year. His seven shootout goals (over 11 attempts) tied for second in the league, one behind Erik Christensen of the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Predators continued to improve and finished with a new team record of 51 wins and 110 points. Despite ranking as the second-best team in the West, Nashville seeded fourth in their conference (divisional winners within the conference take the top three seeds; Detroit beat the Predators by three points in the Central Division). Playing against the San Jose Sharks for the second consecutive year, the Predators were once again eliminated in five games. Kariya struggled with two assists during the series.|$|E
