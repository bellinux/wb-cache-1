5|$|The {{court also}} created the plenary power doctrine, holding {{that the federal}} court did not have {{jurisdiction}} <b>because</b> <b>Congress</b> had not passed a law giving jurisdiction to the federal courts or taking away {{the rights of the}} tribe. Crow Dog was the last in a line of sovereignty cases that began with Cherokee Nation; the next major case, United States v. Kagama, (1886), upheld the plenary power of Congress to enact the Major Crimes Act. The plenary power doctrine allowed Congress to enact any law that it wanted to pass, over the opposition of the tribe or tribes affected. Congress subsequently used this power to breach the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the Kiowa by reducing the size of the Kiowa reservation without their consent. The use of this power led to complaints of being subject to a lawmaking body without representation, especially prior to being granted U.S. citizenship in 1924.|$|E

25|$|The first U.S. {{institution}} with central banking responsibilities was the First Bank of the United States, chartered by Congress and {{signed into law}} by President George Washington on February 25, 1791, at the urging of Alexander Hamilton. This was done despite strong opposition from Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, among numerous others. The charter was for twenty years and expired in 1811 under President Madison, <b>because</b> <b>Congress</b> refused to renew it.|$|E

There was a cholera epidemic and there were Indigenous uprisings in Misantla and Yucatán (the Caste War). Mariano Paredes led an armed uprising against the peace treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. In 1849, Leonardo Márquez revolted in favor of Santa Anna, claiming that the latter's resignation was invalid <b>because</b> <b>Congress</b> {{had not been in}} session.|$|E
25|$|California {{justified}} the statute solely on fiscal grounds, and Stevens held that this justification was insufficient. The state {{could have found}} another non-discriminatory way to reduce welfare costs, other than conditioning the welfare benefit amounts of new residents by reference to their length of stay within the state, or their state of prior residence. Moreover, the fact that PRWORA authorized states to set their own benefit levels did not assist in the determining {{the constitutionality of the}} state statute <b>because</b> <b>Congress</b> cannot authorize states to violate the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
25|$|Before 1981, the {{approval}} process of justices was usually rapid. From the Truman through Nixon administrations, justices were typically approved within one month.

25|$|In 1791, the {{government}} granted the First Bank of the United States a charter {{to operate as}} the U.S. central bank until 1811. The First Bank of the United States {{came to an end}} under President Madison <b>because</b> <b>Congress</b> refused to renew its charter. The Second Bank of the United States was established in 1816, and lost its authority to be the central bank of the U.S. twenty years later under President Jackson when its charter expired. Both banks were based upon the Bank of England. Ultimately, a third national bank, known as the Federal Reserve, was established in 1913 and still exists to this day.|$|E
25|$|The bill thus {{established}} {{a system in}} which Southern blacks could lease abandoned and confiscated land, with yearly rent at 6% (or less) of the land's value (assessed for tax purposes in 1860). After three years, they would have the option to buy this land at full price. The Bureau in charge, which became known as the Freedmen's Bureau, was placed under the continuing supervision of the military <b>because</b> <b>Congress</b> anticipated the need to defend black settlements from White Southerners. The bill implicitly rejected plans by Lincoln and others to colonize blacks abroad, or even in segregated regions of the United States—its mandate would have institutionalized black landownership of the same land that had formerly relied on their unpaid labor.|$|E
25|$|Amtrak, the {{national}} passenger rail system, provides service to Jackson. The Amtrak station {{is located at}} 300 West Capitol Street.

It leaves at 5:40p.m., arrives in Memphis at 10 p.m., and in Chicago at 9 a.m. the new day. Efforts to establish service with another long-distance train, the proposed Crescent Star, {{an extension of the}} Crescent westward from Meridian, Mississippi, to Dallas, failed in 2003, <b>because</b> <b>Congress</b> refused any growth in Amtrak routes.|$|E

In December 1959, Zeckendorf won approval to build a 1,000-room hotel and five privately owned office buildings on L'Enfant Plaza. The Redevelopment Land Agency also approved the condemnation and razing of 14 city blocks for construction of the plaza, hotel, and office buildings. Construction was scheduled to begin on January 1, 1961, but was delayed due to unresolved design issues with L'Enfant Promenade, the short time-frame to prepare detailed construction plans, and <b>because</b> <b>Congress</b> had not granted air rights above 9th Street SW to the developers.|$|E

40|$|The Communications Decency Act (CDA) was {{hotly debated}} before its {{eventual}} passage in 1996 <b>because</b> <b>Congress’s</b> {{first attempt to}} regulate pornography on the Internet raised difficult Constitutional questions about the reach, and limits, of the First Amendment. Nearly 20 years later, one of the law’s unfortunate aftereffects, according to Catholic University third-year law student Erin Callahan, is the legal continued existence of the adult pages of Backpage. com, a web site that carries advertising for the sexual trafficking of children and minors. Delivering the second Student Scholars Series lecture of the 2014 - 15 academic year on Feb. 25, Callahan made {{the argument that the}} adult section of Backpage. com should not be protected by the CDA because the site promotes a “speech act,” which is different from protected free speech.

40|$|In {{the last}} fifteen years, the Board of Immigration Appeals has imposed a {{requirement}} that persons seeking asylum based on membership in a particular social group must establish that the social group is “socially visible” throughout society. This Comment argues that the social visibility requirement should be denied administrative deference on several grounds. The requirement should be denied Chevron deference <b>because</b> <b>Congress’s</b> intent behind the Refugee Act of 1980 is clear and unambiguous and, alternatively, the requirement is an impermissible interpretation of the statute. The requirement is also arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedures Act. This Comment argues that courts should instead follow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ definition of a particular social group, in which social visibility {{is one of two}} methods to establish a particular social group. An adoption of this framework would serve Congress’s intent to adhere to the United States’ international obligations...|$|R
500|$|The Supreme Court again {{upheld the}} preclearance {{requirement}} in City of Rome v. United States (1980). The Court held that <b>because</b> <b>Congress</b> had explicit constitutional power {{to enforce the}} Reconstruction Amendments [...] "by appropriate legislation", the Act did not violate principles of federalism. The Court also explicitly upheld the [...] "discriminatory effect" [...] prong of Section 5, stating {{that even though the}} Fifteenth Amendment directly prohibited only intentional discrimination, Congress could constitutionally prohibit unintentional discrimination to mitigate the risk that jurisdictions may engage in intentional discrimination. Finally, the Court upheld the 1975 extension of Section 5 because of the record of discrimination that continued to persist in the covered jurisdictions. The Court further suggested that the temporary nature of the special provisions was relevant to Section 5's constitutionality.|$|E
500|$|In 1946, the United States Congress {{passed the}} District of Columbia Redevelopment Act, which {{established}} the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency and provided for clearance {{of land and}} redevelopment funds in the capital. After a decade of discussion, public comment, legal battles, and negotiations with landowners and developers, the Southwest Urban Renewal Plan was approved in November 1956. New York City developer William Zeckendorf proposed a grand mall along 10th Street SW, extending from Independence Avenue SW to end at a traffic circle at G Street SW. Zeckendorf named this mall L'Enfant Plaza after Pierre Charles L'Enfant, an architect responsible for planning the city of Washington. L'Enfant Plaza was approved for construction in April 1955. In December 1959, Zeckendorf won approval to build a 1,000-room hotel and five privately owned office buildings on L'Enfant Plaza. The Redevelopment Land Agency also approved the condemnation and razing of 14 city blocks for construction of the plaza, hotel, and office buildings. [...] Construction was to have begun on January 1, 1961, but was delayed due to unresolved design issues with L'Enfant Promenade, the short time-frame to prepare detailed construction plans, and <b>because</b> <b>Congress</b> had not granted air rights above 9th Street SW to the developers.|$|E
500|$|An {{article in}} the Maryland Law Review {{authored}} by Christopher Gozdor (a lawyer in the Maryland Attorney General's office) was also critical of the decision, although he was concerned instead with an alleged lack of clarity in the majority opinion. It discussed the case law relating to government speech and examined what it described as the [...] "conditions doctrine", where certain conditions on receiving federal funds were upheld or struck down. The article {{then turned to the}} Rust distinction. Gozdor explained: [...] "The Court distinguished Velazquez from Rust because Rust involved a subsidy to facilitate private expression of the government's message, while Velazquez involved LSC funding that was designed [...] private speech." [...] The critical question for the court was the characterization of the speech that the law promoted. Because advocacy by LSC grantees to change welfare laws was not in advance of the government's own message, the restriction placed on it essentially prohibited a form of private speech. The relationship, Gozdor asserted, that the Court set forth was that the restriction [...] "distorted" [...] private speech. This [...] "distortion principle" [...] was the main criticism of the article (as was Scalia's dissent). Gozdor, agreeing with Scalia's dissent, wrote that the restriction did not create such a distortion of private speech <b>because</b> <b>Congress</b> had still permitted LSC to form affiliate organizations which would be considered [...] "legally separate". Notwithstanding the difficulty of an organization to classify itself as an [...] "affiliate entity" [...] of LSC, Gozdor argued that there was no real prevention of speech when there were ample alternative means of relaying the message.|$|E

500|$|The {{termination}} of paramountcy {{would have in}} principle meant that all rights that flowed from the states' relationship with the British crown would return to them, leaving them free to negotiate relationships with the new states of India and Pakistan [...] "on a basis of complete freedom". Early British plans for the transfer of power, such as the offer produced by the Cripps Mission, recognised {{the possibility that some}} princely states might choose to stand out of independent India. This was unacceptable to the Indian National Congress, which regarded the independence of princely states as a denial of the course of Indian history, and consequently regarded this scheme as a [...] "Balkanisation" [...] of India. The Congress had traditionally been less active in the princely states because of their limited resources which restricted their ability to organise there and their focus on the goal of independence from the British, and <b>because</b> <b>Congress</b> leaders, in particular Mohandas Gandhi, were sympathetic to the more progressive princes as examples of the capacity of Indians to rule themselves. This changed in the 1930s {{as a result of the}} federation scheme contained in the Government of India Act 1935 and the rise of socialist Congress leaders such as Jayaprakash Narayan, and the Congress began to actively engage with popular political and labour activity in the princely states. By 1939, the Congress' official stance was that the states must enter independent India, on the same terms and with the same autonomy as the provinces of British India, and with their people granted responsible government. As a result, it insisted on the incorporation of the princely states into India in its negotiations with British, but the British took the view that this was not in their power to grant.|$|E
500|$|Various {{proposals}} {{were made by}} the B for a railroad between Staten Island and New Jersey. The accepted proposal consisted of a [...] line from the Arthur Kill to meet the Jersey Central at Cranford, through Union County and the communities of Roselle Park and Linden. Construction on this road started in 1889, and the line was finished {{in the latter part of}} that year. Congress passed a law on June 16, 1886 authorizing the construction of a [...] swing bridge over the Arthur Kill, after three years of effort by Erastus Wiman. The start of construction was delayed for nine months by the need for approval of the Secretary of War, and another six months due to an injunction from the State of New Jersey. This required construction to continue through the brutal winter of 1888 <b>because</b> <b>Congress</b> had set a completion deadline of June 16, 1888, two years after signing the bill. The bridge was completed three days early on June 13, 1888, at 3p.m. At the time of its opening, the Arthur Kill Bridge was the largest drawbridge ever constructed in the world. There were no fatalities in the construction of the bridge. On January 1, 1890, the first train operated from Saint George Terminal to Cranford Junction. Once the Arthur Kill Bridge was completed, pressure was brought upon the United States War Department by the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad to have the newly built bridge torn down and replaced with a bridge with a different design, claiming that it was an obstruction for the navigation of the large numbers of coal barges past Holland Hook on the Arthur Kill.
