In persons requiring hospitalization, pulse oximetry, chest radiography and blood tests—including a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, C-reactive protein level, and possibly liver function tests—are recommended. Procalcitonin may help determine the cause and support who should receive antibiotics. Countries with the greatest <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> include India (43million), China (21million) and Pakistan (10million). It {{is the leading cause}} of death among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available. In 2011, pneumonia was the most common reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the U.S. for infants and children.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether the master theses’ subjects in nursing conform to the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> as Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Methods: In this comparative study, 373 researches registered in the lists of school libraries or university web sites as master degree theses in nursing during 2000 - 2005, were investigated. Then, their subjects were compared with the etiology <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> as Disability Adjusted Life Years in Eastern Mediterranean Region published in World Health Organization Report in 2003. Results: The proportion of theses’ topics and the etiology <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases,</b> including intentional and unintentional accidents, sensory disorders, congenital anomalies, gastrointestinal and dental diseases, respiratory diseases, nutritional deficiencies and endocrine disorders was less than optimum. In contrast, the proportion of theses’ topics on cardiovascular, genitourinary, dermatology and musculoskeletal diseases, diabetes mellitus, neoplasms and maternal and antenatal problems was more than the related DALYs. In addition it was optimum for neuropsychological disorders. Conclusion: Most theses’ topics were in accordance with this health index.
