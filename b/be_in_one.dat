In early 1960 the Teachers Guild merged with a splinter group from the more militant High School Teachers Association to form the United Federation of Teachers (UFT).|$|E

25|$|The use of azulejos for the {{decoration}} of antependia (front of an altar), imitating precious altar cloths, is typical for Portugal. The panel may <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> piece, or composed {{of two or three}} sections. They were used in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. Some antependia of the 17th century imitate oriental fabrics (calico, chintz). The golden fringes of the altar cloth were imitated by yellow motifs on the painted border tiles. Excellent examples {{can be found in the}} Hospital de Sta. Marta, Lisbon, or in the church of Almoster and the Convent of Buçaco.|$|E
25|$|In the Japanese {{version of}} every Dragon Ball anime series and {{subsequent}} related media, Goku has been voiced by Masako Nozawa. Toriyama selected Nozawa upon hearing her audition sample, remarking that only Goku could sound like that. Nozawa stated {{that she was}} ecstatic when she got the role because she {{had always wanted to}} <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of Toriyama's works. She said she had to be mindful of the fact that Goku grew up in the mountains and did not know much of the world. Despite having to voice Goku, Gohan, Goten and Burdock, Nozawa claims she is able to instantly get into the respective character simply upon seeing their image. Nozawa explained that she did not read the manga so that she would not know what was coming in the story until recording, making her reactions the same as Goku's.|$|E

25|$|The {{microwave}} frequencies used in microwave ovens are chosen based on regulatory and cost constraints. The {{first is that}} they should <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency bands set aside for non-communication purposes. For household purposes, 2.45 GHz has the advantage over 915 MHz in that 915 MHz is only an ISM band in the ITU Region 2 while 2.45 GHz is available worldwide. Three additional ISM bands exist in the {{microwave frequencies}}, but are not used for microwave cooking. Two of them are centered on 5.8 GHz and 24.125 GHz, but are not used for microwave cooking because of the very high cost of power generation at these frequencies. The third, centered on 433.92 MHz, is a narrow band that would require expensive equipment to generate sufficient power without creating interference outside the band, and is only available in some countries.|$|E
25|$|The Champions Trophy was {{the brainchild}} of Jagmohan Dalmiya, who was ICC {{president}} in the late 1990s. It had a dual aim of spreading the game to emerging nations and raising money for the ICC in between World Cups, thus enabling it to pump more cash into those fledgling cricket countries. The first tournament, labelled as a mini World Cup, was staged in Dhaka in October 1998 and raised more than £10 million. The second, in Nairobi, was a commercial success although the crowds stayed away. By the time the 2002 event was held – and there was disquiet as it was so close to the World Cup five months later – the idea of playing in developing nations had been ditched and as revenue-generation was the main raison d'etre, it needed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the main countries as this allowed the format to be expanded. In 2004 the jamboree moved to England and it became clear the format of group games led to too many meaningless games. By the time the 2006 tournament in India came into view, the event was under fire from some quarters, and at one time there were even hints that India might decline to take part in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Ribbon: It {{is made of}} satin {{or another}} similar {{material}} cloth of any colour and may be multi-coloured as well as have designs on it. The ribbon itself {{must be at least}} 35g (1oz), 4–6cm (1.6–2.4") in width and for senior category a minimum length of 6m (20') (5m (16.25') for juniors). The ribbon must <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> piece. The end that is attached to the stick is doubled for a maximum length of 1m (3'). This is stitched down both sides. At the top, a very thin reinforcement or rows of machine stitching for a maximum length of 5cm is authorized. This extremity may end in a strap, or have an eyelet (a small hole, edged with buttonhole stitch or a metal circle), to permit attaching the ribbon. The ribbon is fixed to the stick by means of a supple attachment such as thread, nylon cord, or a series of articulated rings. The attachment has a maximum length of 7cm (2.8"), not counting the strap or metal ring {{at the end of the}} stick where it will be fastened. Compulsory elements for the ribbon include flicks, circles, snakes and spirals, and throws. It requires a high degree of co-ordination to form the spirals and circles as any knots which may accidentally form in the ribbon are penalised. During a ribbon routine, large, smooth and flowing movements are looked for.|$|E

The French Société Hippique Percheronne de France (Percheron Horse Society of France) registered between 750 and 885 horses in each year between 2007 and 2010.

500|$|Mappings from a 2-sphere to a 2-sphere can be visualized as {{wrapping}} {{a plastic}} bag around a ball and then sealing it. [...] The sealed bag is topologically equivalent to a 2-sphere, as is {{the surface of the}} ball. The bag can be wrapped more than once by twisting it and wrapping it back over the ball. (There is no requirement for the continuous map to be injective and so the bag is allowed to pass through itself.) The twist can <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of two directions and opposite twists can cancel out by deformation. The total number of twists after cancellation is an integer, called the degree of the mapping. As in the case mappings from the circle to the circle, this degree identifies the homotopy group with the group of integers, Z.|$|E
