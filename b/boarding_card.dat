50|$|The Waterloo Air Terminal was a {{passenger}} reception, check-in facility and heliport on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. Used by British European Airways (BEA) and other European airlines between 1953 and 1957 {{when it was}} replaced by the West London Air Terminal. Passengers checked-in and were issued with a <b>boarding</b> <b>card</b> and transported to either London or Northolt Airports using a fleet of coaches.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2011, a Ryanair passenger, Miro Garcia, {{brought a}} claim against Ryanair for unfair surcharges, {{claiming}} that the €40 (£30) surcharge on passengers who failed to print out a <b>boarding</b> <b>card</b> prior to arrival at the airport was unfair. Judge Barbara Cordoba, sitting in the Commercial Court in Barcelona, held that, under international air travel conventions, Ryanair can neither demand passengers turn {{up at the airport}} with their boarding pass, nor charge them €40 (£30) if they do not, and that the fines were abusive because aviation law obliges airlines to issue boarding passes. Judge Cordoba stated that: [...] "I declare abusive and, therefore, null, the clause in the contract by which Ryanair obliges the passenger to take a boarding pass to the airport... the customary practice over the years has been that the obligation to provide the boarding pass has always fallen on the airline". The judge ordered a refund for Mr Garcia and said the fact the company was a low-cost carrier did [...] "not allow it to alter its basic contractual obligations". Ryanair appealed the decision and the Appeals Court in Spain overturned the ruling in November 2011, holding that the surcharge is in compliance with international law.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{shooting}} down, on 12 February 1979, {{killed all}} 59 on board. The real {{target of the}} second attack was General Peter Walls, head of the COMOPS (Commander, Combined Operations), {{in charge of the}} Special Forces, including the SAS and the Selous Scouts. Due to the large number of tourists returning to Salisbury a second flight had been dispatched. General Walls received a <b>boarding</b> <b>card</b> for the second flight, which departed Kariba 15 minutes after the doomed aircraft. No one has been brought to trial or charged with shooting down the aircraft due to amnesty laws passed by both Smith and Mugabe. In a television interview not long after the attack on the first aircraft, Nkomo joked about the incident while admitting ZAPU had indeed been responsible. In his memoirs, Story of My Life, published in 1985, Nkomo later said, [...] "during that interview, the interviewee had asked about what we used to down the planes and I said stones, jokingly in an attempt to avoid answering the question due to military intelligence which demanded secrecy regarding what type of weapons we had acquired from the Soviet Union. They remembered the laugh and not the regret for the shooting down of both aircraft." ...|$|E

40|$|Using the {{check-in}} area of {{a generic}} airport as an example, investigations were carried out as to whether – and if so, how – operational agreements between various process stakeholders {{have an effect on}} traffic progress. Individual passenger prioritisations decide whether a person is treated with priority at the common security control point which is a critical element of the infrastructure. In the model, status group division takes place at <b>boarding</b> <b>card</b> control. Instead of membership to a passenger class or frequent-flier bonus programme, traffic aspects are now the defining factor in guaranteeing priorities. The investigations were carried out using a microscopic fast-time simulation. A variety of strategies recommend themselves with regard to maximising the number of passengers who can actually catch their flight, depending on the capacity load...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this document, Deliverable 4. 1, is to {{describe}} the Current Supply Profile for its further use in different threads by the DATASET 2050 Horizon 2020 coordination and support action. This deliverable comprises the work conducted in order to define and list the door-to-door mobility supply components, as described in task 4. 1. It presents the baseline supply situation with respect to current door-to-door trips within Europe, including an assessment, identification and mode of the mobility services currently available in Europe (airport access/egress times, airport processes times etc.) All the above will allow the DATASET 2050 project partners to determine {{the time required to}} undertake the current processes involved from leaving the place of origin (the "Door") to the point of arrival at the airport (the "Kerb"), from the Kerb to the moment the passenger has had their <b>boarding</b> <b>card</b> scanned immediately prior to embarkation (the "Gate"). The same approach is used for the Gate-to-Gate processes (including connecting flights and the transfer process), and finally Gate-to-Kerb and Kerb-to-Door. The inherent asymmetries of what are, in principle, symmetric processes have been assessed (e. g. : Door-to-Kerb vs. Kerb-to-Door). D 4. 1 directly feeds the supply side of the mobility model that will be run in WP 5 of DATASET 2050...|$|E
