5|$|Authorities rapidly {{ruled out}} the {{possibility}} that ETA had a cell in the island, with police believing the attack had been carried out by a unit that had travelled to the island specifically to carry it out. Initial reports stated that the bombers had set the bomb off with a remote control. Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of ETA to plant the bomb several days before the attack and leave the island. Earlier, Government delegate for Majorca, Ramon Socías, had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca, and were hiding on the island, waiting for the situation to cool down <b>before</b> <b>attempting</b> to leave.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the advance}} to the Hongorai, {{there was a pause}} of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be {{improved}} and supplies to be brought up, <b>before</b> <b>attempting</b> to cross the Hongorai en masse. This allowed Savige to re-evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers. As they waited for the advance to resume, the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and {{there were a couple of}} significant engagements during this time. As a part of these, the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the Hongorai and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as Egan's Ridge, which, due to its location, commanded the main Australian axis of advance.|$|E
5|$|Numerous notable riders {{were present}} in the race peloton, though their reasons for {{attending}} varied slightly. Top stage racers like Cadel Evans, Ivan Basso, Robert Gesink, Vincenzo Nibali, Joaquim Rodríguez, Andy Schleck, and Marco Pinotti were present. Evans' attendance was mainly for racing kilometers <b>before</b> <b>attempting</b> to win the Tour de France. Basso, who likewise planned to peak at the Tour de France, came to the race hoping for overall victory. He named Gesink as a potential rival, and Gesink for his part claimed Basso as a rider he fears. Schleck, Nibali, and Evans were named by one pre-race analysis as possible contenders, but not favorites, due to their plans to be at peak form later in the season.|$|E

5|$|The game {{kicked off}} in the afternoon; heavy rain showers had fallen the day before, causing a slight delay. The first quarter was scoreless, but Navy scored a {{touchdown}} on the first play of the second quarter. Washington answered Navy with a 23-yard touchdown run on the next drive. Near {{the end of the}} second quarter, Navy scored a touchdown on a two-yard run, giving them a 147 halftime lead. The third quarter was a defensive stalemate as neither team scored. Navy fumbled the ball on their own ten-yard line late in the quarter. Four plays afterward, Washington tied the game on a 12-yard touchdown pass. Navy threw an interception at midfield, and Washington drove down to the Navy 20-yard line <b>before</b> <b>attempting</b> a game-winning field goal. The kick missed and the game ended shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|With Cayenne under British control, Topaze {{made all}} speed for Guadeloupe, Lahalle {{intending}} to land his food supplies and reinforcements on French held territory <b>before</b> <b>attempting</b> the return journey to Europe. For nine days Topaze crossed the Caribbean without encountering any British warships, but at 07:00 on 22 January she was spotted approaching Guadeloupe {{from the southwest}} by the brig HMS Hazard under Captain Hugh Cameron, {{which was part of}} a squadron detached from Cochrane's invasion fleet on Barbados to watch the French islands. Although his lookouts had also sighted a French schooner close inshore, Cameron gave orders for his brig to close with the much larger French frigate instead. Within two hours, Hazard was joined by the frigates HMS Cleopatra under Captain Samuel Pechell and HMS Jason under Captain William Maude. Although both ships were smaller than Topaze, together they held a considerable advantage over the overladen French ship.|$|E
5|$|A major {{earthquake}} {{occurs in}} Los Angeles, caused by terrorists detonating explosives at focal points (places where fault lines intersect).

Fort Lesker, U.S. Military base and {{the epicenter of the}} earthquakes, is attacked and taken over by terrorists, who then begin stealing weapons-grade plutonium <b>before</b> <b>attempting</b> to smuggle the weapons out of the U.S. to the Middle East. Kate Warner's father is forced to aid the terrorists by helping them smuggle the weapons with his customs passes. Jack finally kills Madsen when he tries to escape by shooting his speedboat with an M-80 assault rifle, causing it to explode. He also shoots and kills Max, the man behind the events of Season 2 and The Game, who was holding Kate Warner hostage, saving her life but in doing so Max manages to shoot Jack once in the stomach before dying.

5|$|After Juan Ponce de León {{began the}} {{colonization}} process of Puerto Rico, the archipelago became a strategic military location, used by Spain {{to protect its}} colonies and possessions in America. Vessels {{used it as a}} main point for resupplying <b>before</b> <b>attempting</b> long voyages and trading became a key part of economy. However, when the mines and rivers in the main island of Puerto Rico, then known as San Juan Bautista, were depleted Puerto Rico began suffering from shortage of gold and its income was reduced drastically, precipitating a recession. Beginning in the 16th century, the Spanish Crown was forced to issue a monetary support decree to the archipelago known as situado, which was supplied by the Royal banks in Central America, particularly Mexico. However, this aid failed to arrive often, contributing to the economical instability. This was exacerbated by other factors, including the costs of running an efficient military and a lack of commercial prosperity. Natural conditions and disasters also contributed, multiplying the costs of maintaining fortresses while hurricanes damaged haciendas, destroying crops and shortening the amount of laborers.|$|E
5|$|After sinking Majestic, Hersing {{took his}} {{submarine}} to refuel at a Turkish port <b>before</b> <b>attempting</b> the dangerous route through the Dardanelles to Constantinople. While transiting the straits, U-21 was nearly {{pulled into a}} whirlpool but the Germans managed to escape. After arriving in the Ottoman capital, the crew were given a large welcoming ceremony attended by Enver Pasha. U-21 required significant maintenance, and so the crew was given a month of shore leave while the repairs were carried out. Once the repair work was finished, U-21 sortied through the Dardanelles for another patrol. Hersing spotted the Allied munitions ship Carthage, which he sank with a single torpedo. Later on the patrol, a lookout on an Allied trawler spotted U-21s periscope; the Germans had to crash dive to escape from being rammed, but doing so brought them into a minefield. One mine exploded off the U-boat's stern but it caused no significant damage, and U-21 was able to withdraw to Constantinople.|$|E

However, Homer, who is unaware of events, easily knocks him down, allowing Scorpio's soldiers to shoot the agent. A proud Scorpio happily thanks Homer for a job well done. At dinner, Homer proudly tells of his successes at work, but discovers that his family hates Cypress Creek and {{want to go back}} to Springfield. At first, Homer is opposed to this, saying that he has been doing a great job for the first time in his life, but nobody else is happy. Dejected, Homer decides to visit Scorpio back at Globex Headquarters. His visit coincides with an assault by the U.S. military, but Homer still remains oblivious to what is taking place. He finds Scorpio, explains the situation, and asks what to do. Scorpio advises Homer that he should do what is best for his family.|$|E

5|$|Willaumez {{had planned}} to {{resupply}} his squadron at the Cape itself before searching for the China Fleet, but the crew of a merchant ship captured in the South Atlantic informed him that the Dutch governors had surrendered on 10 January 1806 to an expeditionary force under General Sir David Baird and Commodore Popham after five days of fighting. Turning away from the Cape, Willaumez decided to continue operations in the South Atlantic until April, when he put into Salvador in Brazil for supplies. Willaumez was fortunate to have collected this information <b>before</b> <b>attempting</b> to anchor in Table Bay: Popham had ordered all ships and shore facilities to continue to fly the Dutch flag {{in the hope that}} enemy ships would be lured within range of the port's gun batteries. On 4 March this ruse worked successfully when the frigate Volontaire, detached from Willaumez's squadron in December, anchored in the midst of Popham's squadron without realising their identity. Hopelessly outnumbered, Captain Bretel {{had no choice but to}} surrender, the British boarding party discovering 217 British soldiers in the hold, captured by Willaumez from Redmill's convoy.|$|E
5|$|Appalachian State {{continued}} their drive but {{were forced to}} punt after being stopped on 3rd down. Michigan began their drive at the Appalachian State 34-yard line, but a Henne pass was intercepted by Mountaineer defender Leonard Love on the fourth play of the drive. Love returned the ball 26-yards, and Appalachian State began the drive at their own 41-yard line, but were forced to punt after going three-and-out. Michigan got the ball at their own 24-yard line and mounted a nine-play, 43-yard drive to the Appalachian State 33-yard line. On the final play, a fourth and five, Henne's pass fell incomplete, turning the ball over to Appalachian State, who were again quickly forced to punt. After returning the punt to their own 46-yard line, Hart ran the ball 54yards for a touchdown, giving Michigan the lead 32–31 with 4:36 left. Michigan chose to go for two, but the conversion attempt failed. Edwards was picked off on the first play of the ensuing drive, giving Michigan control of the ball at the Appalachian State 43-yard line. Michigan ran five plays <b>before</b> <b>attempting</b> a 43-yard field goal. The attempt was blocked, however, giving Appalachian State control of the ball with 1:37 left. With no timeouts left, the Mountaineers drove 69yards down the field in just over a minute in game time, setting up a Rauch field goal from 24yards out with 26seconds left. The attempt was good, giving Appalachian State a 34–32 lead. Michigan regained control of {{the ball on the}} ensuing kickoff, and a 46-yard pass from Henne to Mario Manningham gave the Wolverines a 37-yard field goal attempt with six seconds left on the clock. The attempt was blocked by Corey Lynch, securing a 34–32 win by the Mountaineers.|$|E
5|$|Indonesian {{artillery}} fire continued to rain {{down on the}} camp, wounding several men and sending the defenders into disarray. Sergeant-Major Williams rushed to the headquarters to order the artillery officer to bombard the taken positions <b>before</b> <b>attempting</b> to organise a counterattack himself. Whilst under heavy Indonesian fire, Williams gathered a section of defenders who had taken refuge in a slit trench and led them towards the captured outer positions. A shell landed among the group and wounded half of them, but Williams and the remainder engaged at least thirty Indonesian infantry who had been firing into the base from the trench in vicious hand-to-hand combat and managed to push them from it with minor casualties. Williams them looked to secure the perimeter, but seeing that the Indonesians were massing for a second attack, {{he sat down in}} a vacated machine gun nest and sprayed the new wave of attackers, who attempted to seize the command bunker, with fire. This was not without cost, and Williams was fortunate to have escaped with a single head wound, which nevertheless blinded him in one eye, though he did not notice this in the heat of battle. Williams then began to receive supporting rifle fire from other British troops in nearby trenches, as well bombardment from the single remaining mortar and some 105mm artillery emplacements from a nearby camp.|$|E
