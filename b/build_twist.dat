40|$|We {{find the}} general {{solution}} to the twisting equation in the tensor bialgebra T(R) of an associative unital ring R viewed as that of fundamental representation for a universal enveloping Lie algebra and its quantum deformations. We suggest a procedure of constructing twisting cocycles belonging to a given quasitriangular subbialgebra H⊂ T(R). This algorithm generalizes Reshetikhin's approach, which involves cocycles fulfilling the Yang-Baxter equation. Within this framework we study a class of quantized inhomogeneous Lie algebras related to associative rings in a certain way, for which we <b>build</b> <b>twisting</b> cocycles and universal R-matrices. Our approach is a generalization of the methods developed for the case of commutative rings in our recent work including such well-known examples as Jordanian quantization of the Borel subalgebra of sl(2) and the null-plane quantized Poincaré algebra by Ballesteros at al. We reveal the role of special group cohomologies in this process and establish the bicrossproduct structure of the examples studied. Comment: 20 pages, LaTe...|$|R

A definitive version was subsequently published at: [URL] analyses have shown that rotations of a rigid body about the principal axis cor- responding to the intermediate principal moment of inertia are unstable. This poses a potential problem for gymnasts who perform double somersaults without twist in a layout configuration. A computer simulation model is used to investigate configurational strategies for controlling such move- ments. It is shown that the <b>build</b> up of <b>twist</b> is not reduced by abduction of the arms but can be controlled by adopting a configuration with sufficient body flexion. For somersaults with a straight body, control in the form of asymmetrical arm abduction accelerations, based upon twist angular velocity and angular acceleration, is capable of preventing a <b>build</b> up of <b>twist</b> providing that the feedback time delay is less than a quarter somersault...|$|R
50|$|The in-line spinner {{is named}} {{for the fact that}} a metal blade {{revolves}} around a central axis (a wire), which may be attached by a clevis (a c-shaped metal piece with holes that accommodates the wire) or by itself. Most in-line spinners have metal weights rigged behind the spinning blade and beads or brass hardware that separates the two for frictionless spinning.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{categorical}} {{approach to the}} dynamical Yang-Baxter equation (DYBE) for arbitrary Hopf algebras. In particular, we introduce {{the notion of a}} dynamical extension of a monoidal category, which provides a natural environment for quantum dynamical R-matrices, dynamical twists, etc. In this context, we define dynamical associative algebras and show that such algebras give quantizations of vector bundles on coadjoint orbits. We <b>build</b> a dynamical <b>twist</b> for any pair of a reductive Lie algebra and its Levi subalgebra. Using this twist, we obtain an equivariant star product quantization of vector bundles on semisimple coadjoint orbits of reductive Lie groups. ...|$|R
5000|$|Around 3000 B.C., {{the sands}} of Captiva started to erode, {{resulting}} in the eventual formation of Sanibel Island. The Gulf of Mexico waters were eight feet lower than they are today. It is said that the first inhabitants of Captiva were The Calusa Indians. The population of the Calusa {{is believed to have}} reached as many as 50,000 people. [...] "Calusa" [...] means [...] "fierce people", and they were described as a war-like people. The Calusa Indians were resistant to colonization and attacked any explorers who came into their territory. Calusa Indians built their houses on stilts without walls. They wove palmetto leaves together to <b>build</b> roves (<b>twisted</b> strands of fibers). The Calusa Indians fished for food on the coast, bays, rivers, and waterways. They did not farm. “The men and boys of the tribe made nets from palm tree webbing to catch mullet, pinfish, pigfish, and catfish. They used spears to catch eels and turtles. They made fish bone arrowheads to hunt for animals such as deer. The women and children learned to catch shellfish like conchs, crabs, clams, lobsters, and oysters.” [...] The Calusa Indians used the shells on the island for utensils, jewelry, tools, weapons, and ornaments.|$|R

For the symmetric group Sn, there is a 1 – 1 correspondence between Σ and the set of all set compositions (or ordered set partitions) of { 1,…,n}. The product on Σ has a simple combinatorial description in terms of set compositions. We study in detail the representation theory of the Solomon–Tits algebra of Sn over an arbitrary field, and show how our results relate to the corresponding results on the Solomon algebra of Sn. This includes the construction of irreducible and principal indecomposable modules, a description of the Cartan invariants, of the Ext-quiver, and of the descending Loewy series.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out into the twist blockage which may occur when yarns pass over guides or other surfaces. The influence of primary physical parameters such as surface curvature, are and length of contact, yarn twist level and tension and yarn/surface friction have been investigated together with secondary parameters such as yarn surface, pressure, angle of approach etc. As a result of these investigations, three mechanisms of blockage have been identified. The first of these occurs especially with doubled yarn in which the components lie {{side by side on the}} guide surface and blocked <b>twist</b> <b>builds</b> up until sufficient torque is developed to turn the yarn over against the couple generated by the components of yarn tension and reaction on the guide surface. In the second mechanism blocking torque is generated by components of friction on the yarn surface at right angles to the yarn axis. These orthogonal friction components may arise from interaction between the topography of the twisted yarn surface and the guide surface or may be generated by forces arising from an angular orientation of yarn to guide. The third mechanism is intermediate between the other two where a singles yarn (or its equivalent) is flattened on the surface and resistance to twist transmission is generated partly by internal friction within the yarn and partly by yarn/guide frictional forces. The main circumstances under which these different mechanisms may operate, have been identified and suggestions made for minimising the blockage of twist...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{geometric}} framework {{that characterizes the}} synchronization problem [...] - the problem of consistently registering or aligning a collection of objects. The theory we formulate characterizes the cohomological nature of synchronization based on the classical theory of fibre bundles. We first establish the correspondence between synchronization problems in a topological group G over a connected graph Γ and the moduli space of flat principal G-bundles over Γ, and develop a discrete analogy of the renowned theorem of classifying flat principal bundles with fix base and structural group using the representation variety. In particular, we show that prescribing an edge potential on a graph is equivalent to specifying an equivalence class of flat principal bundles, of which the triviality of holonomy dictates the synchronizability of the edge potential. We then develop a twisted cohomology theory for associated vector bundles of the flat principal bundle arising from an edge potential, which is a discrete version of the twisted cohomology in differential geometry. This theory realizes the obstruction to synchronizability as a cohomology group of the twisted de Rham cochain complex. We then <b>build</b> a discrete <b>twisted</b> Hodge theory [...] - a fibre bundle analog of the discrete Hodge theory on graphs [...] - which geometrically realizes the graph connection Laplacian as a Hodge Laplacian of degree zero. Motivated by our geometric framework, we study the problem of learning group actions [...] - partitioning a collection of objects based on the local synchronizability of pairwise correspondence relations. A dual interpretation is to learn finitely generated subgroups of an ambient transformation group from noisy observed group elements. A synchronization-based algorithm is also provided, and we demonstrate its efficacy using simulations and real data. Comment: 47 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
