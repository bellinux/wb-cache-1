40|$|Objectives This study {{investigated}} the association between perceived ethnic discrimination and depressive symptoms among <b>biethnic</b> adolescents in South Korea. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study of 4141 <b>biethnic</b> adolescents {{using data from the}} 2012 National Survey of Multicultural Families. Perceived ethnic discrimination was measured using the question “Have you ever been discriminated against or ignored because either of your parents is not a Korean?” with an assessment of depressive symptoms over the past 12 months. Logistic regression was applied to examine potential associations between perceived ethnic discrimination and depressive symptoms. Results Among 4141 <b>biethnic</b> adolescents, 558 (13. 5 %) reported having experienced ethnic discrimination. The most common discriminatory perpetrators were friends (n= 241, 5. 8 %), followed by strangers (n= 67, 1. 6 %). Depressive symptoms were related to experience of ethnic discrimination (odds ratio [OR], 3. 80; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 89 to 4. 98) after adjusting for potential confounders. In an analysis focusing on the perpetrators of discrimination, depressive symptoms were found to be associated with perceived ethnic discrimination from friends (OR, 3. 95; 95 % CI, 2. 75 to 5. 68), teachers (OR, 4. 53; 95 % CI, 2. 16 to 9. 51), family members and relatives (OR, 3. 89; 95 % CI, 1. 59 to 9. 48), neighbors (OR, 2. 48; 95 % CI, 1. 14 to 5. 38), and strangers (OR, 2. 49; 95 % CI, 1. 30 to 4. 79). Furthermore, the OR for depressive symptoms among those exposed to 1, 2, or 3 or more discriminatory perpetrators were 3. 61 (95 % CI, 2. 49 to 5. 24), 3. 61 (95 % CI, 1. 68 to 7. 74), and 6. 69 (95 % CI, 2. 94 to 15. 22), respectively.

40|$|Objectives: In South Korea (hereafter Korea), {{the number}} of {{adolescent}} offspring of immigrants has rapidly increased since the early 1990 s, mainly due to international marriage. This research sought to examine the association between the experience of school violence and mental health outcomes, {{and the role of}} help-seeking behaviors in the association, among <b>biethnic</b> adolescents in Korea. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data of 3627 <b>biethnic</b> adolescents in Korea from the 2012 National Survey of Multicultural Families. Based on the victim’s help-seeking behavior, adolescents who experienced school violence were classified into three groups: ‘seeking help’ group; ‘feeling nothing’ group; ‘not seeking help’ group. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to examine the associations between the experience of school violence and depressive symptoms for males and females separately. Results: In the gender-stratified analysis, school violence was associated with depressive symptoms in the ‘not seeking help’ (odds ratio [OR], 7. 05; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 3. 76 to 13. 23) and the ‘seeking help’ group (OR, 2. 77; 95 % CI, 1. 73 to 4. 44) among male adolescents after adjusting for potential confounders, including the nationality of the immigrant parent and Korean language fluency. Similar associations were observed in the female groups. However, in the ‘feeling nothing’ group, the association was only significant for males (OR, 8. 34; 95 % CI, 2. 82 to 24. 69), but not females (OR, 0. 77; 95 % CI, 0. 18 to 3. 28). Conclusions: This study suggests that experience of school violence is associated with depressive symptoms and that the role of victims’ help-seeking behaviors in the association may differ by gender among <b>biethnic</b> adolescents in Korea...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Cocaine is {{a central}} nervous system {{stimulant}} associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors, morbidity, and mortality. Despite these demonstrated relationships, it {{has been difficult to}} assess the long-term cardiovascular consequences of cocaine use. METHODS: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study provides an opportunity to evaluate the association of lifetime cocaine use with cardiovascular disease risk factors in a randomly sampled <b>biethnic</b> cohort of men and women of varied socioeconomic status, aged 20 to 32 in 1987. RESULTS: More extensive cocaine use experience was associated with being White, older, and less educated, regardless of sex. Higher levels of licit and illicit substance use behavior were reported by those reporting more extensive cocaine experience; however, most cardiovascular disease risk factors such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, hypertension, physical activity, and anthropometric measurements were not related to lifetime cocaine experience. CONCLUSIONS: In this age group, the detrimental cardiovascular effects of cocaine may be limited to acute effects.

Our {{aim was to}} investigate middle {{cerebral artery}} stenosis in the <b>biethnic</b> (Jewish and Arab) population of patients with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack in northern Israel. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: The study population included 1344 patients from the stroke data registry who had been hospitalized in the neurologic department because of acute ischemic stroke (1041) or TIA (303) and had undergone transcranial Doppler sonographic exami-nation during the hospitalization. RESULTS: Of the 1344 patients, 120 (8. 9 %) {{were found to have}} MCA stenosis. The patients with intracranial stenosis were older and had more vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) and vascular diseases (ischemic heart and peripheral vascular disease) than those without intracranial stenosis. Logistic regression analysis revealed that diabetes (P. 002) and peripheral vascular disease (P. 01), but not ethnicity, were independent and significant predictors for the presence of MCA stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: An independent and significant correlationwas foundbetweenMCA stenosis and vascular risk factors (diabetesmellitus) and vascular diseases, thus emphasizing the similarity of intracranial MCA stenosis and other vascular diseases originating from athero-sclerosis. There was no influence of ethnicity on intracranial stenosis in our population. ABBREVIATION: TCD transcranial Doppler sonograph...|$|E

Design: A community-partnered participatory research project. Setting: A low-income, <b>biethnic</b> African American and Latino neighborhood in South Los Angeles. Participants: Adult community residents aged > 18 years. Main Outcome Measures: Household survey and clinical data collection; neighborhood characteristics; neighborhood observations; and community resources asset mapping. Results: We enrolled 206 participants (90 % of those eligible), of whom 205 completed the household interview and examination, and 199 provided laboratory samples. Among enrollees, 82 (40 %) were aged > 50 years and participated in functional status measurement. We completed neighborhood observations on 93 street segments; an average of 2. 2 (SD= 1. 6) study participants resided on each street segment observed. The community asset map identified 290 resources summarized in a Community Resource Guide given to all participants.

Moreover, {{little is known about the}} relationship between obesity and poststroke mortality among Latinos, par-ticularly Mexican Americans (MAs), a subgroup with high rates of severe obesity and incident stroke. 1, 13 For these reasons, we sought to explore the association of BMI and all-cause mortality among patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in a <b>biethnic</b> population–based stroke surveillance study.

Growing evidence also suggests SES gradients in levels of peripheral blood markers of inflammation. However, we know little about potential gender and racial/ethnic differences in associations between SES and inflammation, {{despite the fact that the}} burden of inflammation-related diseases varies by gender and race. The present study examines SES (education and income) gradients in levels of two inflammatory biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), in a <b>biethnic</b> (White and Black) sample of men and women (n = 3549, aged 37 – 55 years) in the USA from the CARDIA Study.

Age-adjusted CRP and IL- 6 levels were inversely associated with education level in each race/gender group except Black males. Income gradients were also observed in each race/gender group for IL- 6 and in White females and males for CRP. In general, differences in CRP and IL- 6 levels between low and high SES groups were reduced in magnitude and significance with the addition of health status, behavioral, and psychosocial variables, although the impact of the addition of model covariates varied across race/gender groups and different SES-inflammation models. Overall, findings indicate SES gradients in levels of inflammation burden in middle-aged White and Black males and females...|$|E
40|$|Catholics {{represent}} almost 5 % of {{the total}} population of Moldavia. Their spiritual identity was formed in opposition to that of the Orthodox majority and according to the universal church dogmata, preached by the missionary priests who reached the territory surrounded by the Carpathians, the Nister, the Black Sea, the Danube and the Milcov as early as the 14 th century. In the Middle Ages, religion was the means of differentiating oneself from the others and not ethnicity. Therefore, the large Catholic communities around Roman and Bacău, of mixed ethnic origin (Hungarian and Romanian) and of different ages (due to the Transcarpathian movement of the population from Transylvania), considered themselves to be Catholics and nothing else until the modern period. Once the ideas of nation and nationality appeared, these <b>biethnic</b> groups were gradually involved in the process of formation of the modern states (Romania and Hungary). The Catholics of other origins, such as Polish, German, Armenian, Rroma, French and Italian are very few and some even became completely Romanian, preserving only their religious identity. As many of the speakers of Hungarian and Romanian (called Csangos by the Hungarians and the Secklers) lived in Moldavia, it was inevitable for them to be subjected to a natural process of becoming Romanian, through school, army and church for the past 150 years.

40|$|Endothelial lipase (EL) plays {{a pivotal}} role in HDL metabolism. We sought to {{characterize}} EL and its interaction with HDL as well as its natural variants genetically, functionally and structurally. We screened our <b>biethnic</b> population sample (n = 802) for selected missense mutations (n = 5) and identified T 111 I as the only common variant. Multiple linear regression analyses in Hispanic subjects revealed an unexpected association between T 111 I and elevated LDL-C (p-value = 0. 012) and total cholesterol (p-value = 0. 004). We examined lipase activity of selected missense mutants (n = 10) and found different impacts on EL function, ranging from normal to complete loss of activity. EL-HDL lipidomic analyses indicated that EL has a defined remodeling of HDL without exhaustion of the substrate and a distinct and preference for several fatty acids that are lipid mediators and known for their potent pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. Structural studies using homology modeling revealed a novel a/b motif in the C-domain, unique to EL. The EL dimer was found to have the flexibility to expand and to bind various sizes of HDL particles. The likely impact of the all known missense mutations (n = 18) on the structure of EL was examined using molecular modeling and the impact they may have on EL lipase activity using a novel structure-function slope based on their structural free energy differences. The results of this multidisciplinary approach delineated the impact of EL and its variants on HDL. Moreover, the results suggested EL to have the capacity to modulate vascular health throug...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Low {{dietary intake}} of the {{essential}} nutrient choline and its metabolite betaine may increase atherogenesis both through effects on homocysteine methylation pathways {{as well as through}} choline's antioxidants properties. Nutrient values for many common foods for choline and betaine have recently become available in the U. S. nutrient composition database. Our objective was to assess the association of dietary intake of choline and betaine with incident coronary heart disease (CHD), adjusting for dietary intake measurement error. Methods We conducted a prospective investigation of the relation between usual intake of choline and betaine with the risk of CHD in 14, 430 middle-aged {{men and women of the}} <b>biethnic</b> Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to assess nutrient intake. Proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate the risk of incident CHD. A regression calibration method was used to adjust for measurement error. Results During an average 14 years of follow-up (1987 – 2002), 1, 072 incident CHD events were documented. Compared with the lowest quartile of intake, incident CHD risk was slightly and non-significantly higher in the highest quartile of choline and choline plus betaine, HR = 1. 22 (0. 91, 1. 64) and HR = 1. 14 (0. 85, 1. 53), controlling for age, sex, education, total energy intake, dietary intakes of folate, methionine and vitamin B 6. No association was found between dietary choline intake and incident CHD when correcting for measurement error. Conclusion Higher intakes of choline and betaine were not protective for incident CHD.

40|$|Background: African Americans (AAs) {{not only}} have higher blood-pressure levels, but also an {{increased}} risk of low weight at birth, compared with European Americans (EAs). In light of fetal programming theories, {{it has been suggested that}} ethnic differences in blood pressure originate in utero. However, most previous studies in <b>biethnic</b> samples have not found a significant inverse association between birth weight and blood pressure in AAs. Methods: In 562 EA and 465 AA adolescent twins of the Georgia Cardiovascular Twin Study, we investigated the potential ethnic difference in the association of blood pressure and birth weight, with the ability to control for potential confounding by familial factors. Results: Blood-pressure levels were significantly higher in AAs compared to EAs, independent of birth weight (P <. 01). After adjustment for parental factors and body mass index, the difference in systolic blood pressure per kg birth weight was - 1. 1 mm Hg (95 % confidence interval, - 2. 7 to 0. 48, P =. 17) in EAs, and - 2. 5 mm Hg (95 % confidence interval, - 4. 7 to - 0. 40, P =. 02) in AAs. A significant ethnic interaction was revealed in paired analysis, where the inverse association remained in AAs, but not in EAs. Associations with diastolic blood pressure were generally weaker and nonsignificant. Conclusions: We showed that low birth weight was associated with an elevated systolic blood pressure in AAs, independent of familial factors. The results also suggest that the association between birth weight and blood pressure may be more pronounced in AAs in adolescence.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness and the definitive published version is available at [URL] Physical activity (PA) attenuates chronic stress and age-related and cardiovascular disease risks, whereby potentially slowing telomere shortening. We aimed to study the association between seven-day objectively measured habitual PA, chronic stress and leukocyte telomere length. METHODS: Study participants were African (n= 96) and Caucasian (n= 107) school teachers of the Sympathetic activity and Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Africans study. All lifestyle characteristics (including PA) were objectively measured. The general health questionnaire and serum cortisol were assessed as psychological and physical measures of chronic stress. Leukocyte telomere length was measured using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Africans had significantly shorter telomeres (p<. 001) and greater psychological distress (p= 0. 001) than Caucasians, whereas no group difference was seen for cortisol levels. Higher age [ß=- 0. 28 (- 0. 40, - 0. 16), p≤ 0. 000], higher alcohol consumption [ß=- 0. 21 (- 0. 36, - 0. 08), p= 0. 003] and increased central obesity [ß=- 0. 17 (- 0. 30, - 0. 03), p= 0. 017] were all significantly associated with shorter telomeres. Habitual PA of different intensity was not significantly associated with markers of chronic stress or telomere length. However, more time spent with light intensity PA time was significantly and independently correlated with lower waist circumference (r=- 0. 21, p= 0. 004); in turn, greater waist circumference was significantly associated shorter telomeres [β=- 0. 17 (- 0. 30, - 0. 03), p= 0. 017]. CONCLUSION: Habitual PA of different intensity was not directly associated with markers of chronic stress and leukocyte telomere length in this <b>biethnic</b> cohort.

40|$|To {{quantify}} {{the effect of}} the apolipoprotein (apo) E polymorphism on the magnitude of postprandial lipemia, we have defined its role in determining the response to a single high-fat meal in a large sample of (N = 474) individuals taking part in the <b>biethnic</b> Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. The profile of postprandial response in plasma was monitored over 8 h by triglyceride, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TGRL) -triglyceride, apo B- 48 /apo B- 100 ratio, and retinyl palmitate concentrations, and the apo E polymorphism was determined by DNA amplification and digestion. The frequency of the apo E alleles and their effects on fasting lipid levels in this sample were similar to those reported elsewhere. Postprandial plasma retinyl palmitate response to a high-fat meal with vitamin A was significantly different among apo E genotypes, with delayed clearance in individuals with an epsilon 2 allele, compared with epsilon 3 / 3 and epsilon 3 / 4 individuals. In the sample of 397 Caucasians, average retinyl palmitate response was 1, 489 micrograms/dl in epsilon 2 / 3 individuals, compared with 1, 037 micrograms/dl in epsilon 3 / 3 individuals and 1, 108 micrograms/dl in epsilon 3 / 4 individuals. The apo E polymorphism accounted for 7. 1 % of the interindividual variation in postprandial retinyl palmitate response, a contribution proportionally greater than its well-known effect on fasting LDL-cholesterol. However, despite this effect on postprandial retinyl palmitate, the profile of postprandial triglyceride response was not significantly different among apo E genotypes. The profile of postprandial response was consistent between the sample of Caucasians and a smaller sample of black subjects. While these data indicate that the removal of remnant particles from circulation is delayed in subjects with the epsilon 2 / 3 genotype, there is no reported evidence that the epsilon 2 allele predisposes to coronary artery disease (CAD). The results of this study provide not only a reliable estimate of the magnitude of {{the effect of the}} apo E polymorphism on various measurements commonly used to characterize postprandial lipemia, but also provide mechanistic insight into the effects of the apo E gene polymorphism on postprandial lipemia and CAD...|$|E

Objective To investigate the association of 4 anthropometric measurements with cardiometabolic risk factors in a UK <b>biethnic</b> sample of South Asians (SAs) and white Europeans (WEs). Patients and Methods Baseline {{data were collected from}} adults of WE and SA origin participating in the Leicester arm of the Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment in People with Screen Detected Diabetes in Primary Care (ADDITION-Leicester) study between August 2004 and December 2007. Overall, 6268 WE and SA adults had measures of body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio assessed between June 18, 2004, and December 4, 2007. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, and dysglycemia were established from venous blood samples using standard definitions. Crude and adjusted (covariates used were age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, and alcohol consumption) odds ratios were calculated using multivariate logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under the curve were used to calculate optimal cut points for the whole cohort and for both ethnic groups. Results Increases in all anthropometric measurements resulted in a higher odds ratio for each of the risk factors in both the crude and adjusted models (P<. 001). The adjusted odds ratios for dyslipidemia, hypertension, and dysglygemia ranged from 1. 30 to 1. 35, from 1. 36 to 1. 52, and from 1. 62 to 1. 75 (P<. 001 for all), respectively, in WEs. The adjusted odds ratio for dyslipidemia, hypertension, and dysglygemia ranged from 1. 50 to 1. 65 (P<. 01), from 1. 40 to 1. 60 (P<. 01), and from 1. 96 to 2. 11 (P<. 001 for all), respectively, in SAs. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for all the anthropometric measurements had low accuracy (P<. 70) for the whole cohort and when stratified by ethnicity and sex.
