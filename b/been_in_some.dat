Halotus' great rise in status, and his subsequent prosperity, may have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> way beneficial in Galba's eyes. Less specifically, the move would certainly have had some degree of benefit for Galba in some way, whether indirectly, or directly, economically or financially.|$|E

5|$|Lana is Sindi (Marisa Warrington) and Penny Watts' (Andrea McEwan) cousin. She {{was born}} in Australia, but her family moved to Canada when she was young. They {{returned}} to Australia a few years later, and Lana began attending Wattle Heights High School, where she was bullied over her sexuality. This led her to transfer to Erinsborough High. Lana finds employment at the Coffee Shop alongside Serena Bishop, whom she befriends. Lana is convinced {{that she had seen}} Serena before, and she realises that Serena had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> photos taken by dodgy photographer Chris Cousens. Lana admits to Serena that she had also been taken in by Chris and that she was not over it. Lana did not get on with Serena's cousin, Sky, and one day they fight at school. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) places them in detention and urges them to work things out.|$|E

5|$|The next year, {{a council}} held at Westminster {{became one of}} the early stages in the king's growing quarrel with Becket over {{criminal}} clerks. The quarrel was sparked by the problem of clergy who committed crimes; Becket supported the Church's position that all clergy, even those in minor orders, could be tried only in ecclesiastical courts. As perhaps as many as a fifth of the population of England may have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> form of clerical orders, including the minor ones, allowing this would have diminished the king's authority. In the past, English law had tried clerks who committed serious offences in the royal courts, but recent changes in canon law were changing this practice. At Westminster, Henry tried to get the leading laymen and bishops to swear to uphold the old customs of England, instead of the newer canon law practices. All the bishops swore, with the reservation that the customs were not in conflict with canon law. Hilary, however, added no qualifiers to his oath. Although the oath supported Becket's position, after the council most of the bishops, including Hilary, were persuaded by the king to support some compromise position, and threw their support behind Henry.|$|E

25|$|Like many German {{doctors who}} had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> way complicit with the Nazi regime's crimes against humanity, Stieve was never held accountable. After the Doctors' Trial at Nuremberg in 1946 led to {{convictions}} of 14 physicians who had conducted experiments on unwilling living subjects in concentration camps, the country's medical profession looked within itself {{to see who}} else among its members had also committed war crimes. In 1948 {{it was announced that}} only several hundred of the country's thousands of physicians had done so, a number that excluded Stieve and many of his fellow anatomists who did their work at universities rather than camps. The profession was worried about the possible loss of teaching physicians to Germany if all who had accepted bodies of the executed for research were imprisoned or otherwise disqualified from practicing or teaching.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{prediction}} {{of the theory}} is the extreme porosity of matter. As supposed by Fatio and Le Sage in 1690/1758 (and before them, Huygens) matter must consist mostly of empty space so that the very small particles can penetrate the bodies nearly undisturbed and therefore every single part of matter can {{take part in the}} gravitational interaction. This prediction has <b>been</b> (<b>in</b> <b>some</b> respects) confirmed {{over the course of the}} time. Indeed, matter consists mostly of empty space and certain particles like neutrinos can pass through matter nearly unhindered. However, the image of elementary particles as classical entities who interact directly, determined by their shapes and sizes (in the sense of the net structure proposed by Fatio/Le Sage and the equisized spheres of Isenkrahe/Darwin), is not consistent with current understanding of elementary particles. The Lorentz/Thomson proposal of electrical charged particles as the basic constituents of matter is inconsistent with current physics as well.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the ensuing}} months, Jung wrote to Freud about the relationship, at first accusing Spielrein of having {{tried unsuccessfully to}} seduce him, and then admitting that he had become romantically {{involved}} with her. [...] He sent a series of letters to Spielrein's mother, writing [...] "no one can prevent two friends from doing as they wish...the likelihood is that something more may enter the relationship".

2500|$|From {{west to east}} across North Africa, {{eight of}} these new Berbers states have been identified, being the kingdoms of: Altava (near present-day Tlemcen); the Ouarsenis (by Tiaret); Hodna; the Aures (southern Numidia); the Nemencha; the Dorsale (at Thala, south of El Kef); Capsus (at Capsa); and, Cabaon (in Tripolitania, at Oea). The eastern-most five of these Berber kingdoms were located within the old Africa Proconsularis, and all eight were within the now defunct Diocese of Africa (314–432), Carthage its capital. Alike in {{situation}} to the newly formed Germanic kingdoms within the fallen Empire in Europe to the north, these Berber kingdoms served two disparate populations: the Romani who were [...] "the settled communities of provincial citizens" [...] and the [...] "barbarians", here the Mauri, [...] "Berber tribes along and beyond the frontier". The Romani contributed the urban resources and fiscal structure for which a civil administration was required, while the Mauri provided fruits of the countryside and satisfied essential military and security requirements. This functional and ethnic duality {{at the core of}} the Berber successor states is reflected in the title of the political leader at Altava (see here above), one Masuna, found on an inscription: rex gent(ium) Maur(orum) et Romanor(um). King Masuna of the Mauri and of the Romans must have <b>been,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> perhaps transformed way, similar to Firmus or Gildo (see above).|$|E
2500|$|With Washington {{clinging}} to a 4-3 lead, Max Scherzer came in on short rest to pitch {{the top of the}} fifth inning for the Nationals – his first relief appearance since the 2013 American League Division Series, when he was with the Detroit Tigers – and quickly got two outs; Cubs officials in the stands later told the press that they were preparing for Scherzer to pitch three or four lockdown innings and preserve Washington′s lead late into the game. Then the inning took a bizarre turn and descended into disaster for Washington. Scherzer gave up consecutive singles to Willson Contreras and pinch-hitter Ben Zobrist and a bases-clearing double to Addison Russell that gave the Cubs a 5-4 lead. [...] The Nationals intentionally walked Jason Heyward, and then Scherzer struck out [...] second baseman Javier Báez for what should have been the third out. However, the third strike got past Wieters, and Báez ran to first on the passed ball. Rather than hold the ball at home to prevent the Cubs from scoring, Wieters tried to throw out Báez at first, and his throw went into right field, allowing Russell to score, Heyward to advance to third, and Báez to reach second, and giving Chicago a 6-4 lead. Wieters asked the umpires to declare the ball dead and the play a strikeout on the grounds of offensive interference, claiming Báez's bat had hit him {{in the back of the}} head on the backswing – a contention confirmed by video evidence – but the umpires made a controversial ruling that even if the bat had struck Wieters, it did not interfere with the play and did not merit a ruling that the ball was dead, and they let the play stand. Next, Cubs pinch-hitter Tommy La Stella reached first base on a catcher's interference call against Wieters, loading the bases, and Scherzer followed that by hitting Jon Jay in the foot with a pitch, sending him to first and forcing in Heyward from third to increase Chicago′s lead to 7-4. Kris Bryant returned to the plate as the tenth Cubs batter of the inning, and popped out on Scherzer′s 28th pitch to bring the shocking inning to a close. After the game, Cubs manager Joe Maddon described the inning as [...] "bizarro world," [...] and Scherzer said, [...] "I′m sure I′ve <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> crazy stuff before, but nothing like that." [...] It was the first time in recorded MLB history, a total of some 2.73 million half-innings, that an intentional walk, a passed-ball strikeout, catcher′s interference, and a hit batsman had ever occurred in a single half-inning.|$|E
