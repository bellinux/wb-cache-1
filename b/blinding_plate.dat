40|$|This report {{examines}} how the 27 cooled labs at NOCS which experience the most passive solar gain {{can be better}} shaded from the sun. The objective is to greatly reduce the cooling load in these labs and hence electricity consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases. Cooling load can also be reduced by minimising heat from equipment and especially low-temperature freezers. Seven plates, on levels 1, 4 and 6, contain labs which have SE and SW outward-looking aspects i. e. away from the courtyards. The SE-facing labs may experience solar gain in the mornings whereas the SW-facing labs may experience solar gain throughout the working day. Currently solar gain is reduced {{by the use of}} double glazing, internal solar-control films and/or various types of internal blinds. To further reduce solar gain it is recommended that external solar-control films and brise soleil (fixed external shades) are installed while possibly retaining the <b>blinds.</b> Outside <b>Plate</b> 671 small trees could provide shade. Specific suggestions are made for labs in each plate, some of which include increasing the overhang of the new roof. The effect of solar shading on natural lighting in the labs will have to be considered in any new arrangement...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental program in which a <b>blind</b> bolted collar <b>plate</b> connection to an unfilled hollow section (HS) column was tested in tension under static loading. The collar plate connection which connects beam flanges to the side face of HS columns is proposed as an alternative connection to a typical face connection, i. e. the extended endplate connection or the T-stub connection (with T-stubs connecting the top and bottom flanges of the beam to the face of the column). The collar plate connection was found to be much stiffer than a typical face connection in the tension region [...] Comparison of the test results and three dimensional finite element (FE) modelling indicates that the FE analysis can be used to predict the connection behaviour with sufficient accuracy. The preliminary investigations for collar plate connection show promising results and form the basis for the development of other blind bolted side connections for applications in the low rise construction industry...|$|R
40|$|Uma das técnicas mais aplicadas para medir tensões residuais em componentes mecânicos é a técnica do furo cego. Esta técnica é de fácil aplicação {{industrial}} e é normalizada pela ASTM E 837. Entretanto, devido à concentração de tensões gerada pelo furo, há restrições quanto à aplicação deste método quando as tensões residuais presentes excedem 0. 3 da tensão de escoamento do material, Sy. Há na literatura trabalhos que avaliam, por elementos finitos, os erros gerados ao se aplicar diretamente estes coeficientes em componentes com altos níveis de tensões residuais. Em alguns casos, o erro pode chegar a 140 %, para tensões da ordem de 0. 9 de Sy. Porém, para retrocalcular as tensões residuais estes trabalhos também usam hipóteses válidas apenas no regime elástico, de forma que os resultados por eles apresentados podem ter imprecisões. Neste trabalho propõem-se novas metodologias numéricas para avaliar a validade da norma ASTM E 837 em regime plástico, através de uma modelagem mais realística do alívio de tensão gerado pela usinagem do furo, evitando o uso de hipóteses linear-elásticas. Estas metodologias são: Estado Equivalente, na qual uma tensão equivalente àquela agindo no componente é aplicada na borda do furo; metodologia Morte de Elementos na qual os elementos presentes na região em que o furo será usinado são eliminados numericamente em vários passos, de forma a simular o processo de usinagem; e a metodologia Tensão Substituta, na qual o material presente na região do furo é substituído pela tensão que nele age, a qual é retirada gradativamente. Foram modeladas em elementos finitos placas com furos passantes e cegos, submetidas a carregamentos uniaxiais e biaxiais, desde 0. 3 Sy até 0. 9 Sy. Além disso, foram utilizados nas simulações materiais tendo limite elástico e de escoamento coincidentes e não coincidentes. Os erros encontrados entre as tensões retrocalculadas e as tensões aplicadas, para todas as situações são menores que encontrados por outros pesquisadores, obtendo-se no pior caso 70 %. Finalmente, conclui-se que as metodologias Tensão Substituta e Morte de Elementos são as que simulam de forma mais próxima da realidade o processo de usinagem de um furo em um placa submetida à altas tensões. One of {{the most}} popular techniques applied to measure residual stresses is the hole-drilling technique. The technique is easy to be applied at industry, and is normalized ASTM E 837. However, due to the stress concentration caused by the machined hole, the technique can not be used if the residual stresses are higher than one third of the material yield strength, Sy. There are several researches articles that evaluate the errors aroused from the use of linear-elastic coefficients in case where plastic strains are present. In general, those articles apply the finite element to simulate the process of drilling the hole and stress relief. In certain case it is showed that the error can reach 140 % of the applied stress. However,those articles use linear-elastics hypothesis and therefore their predictions can also include mistakes. The present work proposes new numerical methodologies to evaluate the usefulness of the hole- drilling technique, as it is described by the ASTM E 387, in the plastic range. The aim is to model the stress relief caused by the hole`s drilling process in a more realistic way, {{in order to avoid the}} use of linear-elastics hypothesis. The proposed methodologies are: Equivalent State, in which is applied in the hole a stress equivalent to that one acting externally on the component; Element Death, in which the drilling process is simulated by eliminating numerically in several steps the material which vanishes during the drilling process, and the Replacement Stress; in which the material in the hole is replaced by the stress that is acting at its walls. Those mentioned methodologies were implemented using a commercial finite element program which simulated plates with through the thickness and <b>blind</b> holes. Those <b>plates</b> have been loaded with three different loadings which varied from 0. 3 to 0. 9 Sy. Two materials with different stress-strain curves have been used. One of them had the elastic limit equal to the yield limit and the other one has those two limits different. In the worst case the errors found were 70 %, which is smaller than those found by others researchers. It was concluded that, the Replacement Stress and the Elements Death methodologies are those that best simulate the process of drilling a hole in a plate which is under high stresses...|$|R
