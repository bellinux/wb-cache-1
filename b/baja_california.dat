5|$|Nora crossed {{an area of}} {{abnormally}} {{warm water}} near {{the west coast of}} the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Peninsula. It restrengthened slightly before making its first landfall near , <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Sur, on September 25. When Nora was inland, the area of the storm located in the Gulf of California began to reintensify. Hurricane Nora then made a second landfall about 60 miles (95 km) south-southeast of San Fernando, <b>Baja</b> <b>California.</b>|$|E

5|$|While Nora stayed off the Pacific {{coast of}} Mexico, the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (National Meteorological Service) issued a {{hurricane}} {{watch for the}} coast between Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán, and Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, and several major ports in the shoreline closed to navigation. As the storm {{moved away from the}} mainland coast and towards the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Peninsula, about 500 people were evacuated from their homes near Cabo San Lucas, <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Sur, and placed in shelters to prepare for the storm's impact. At the same time, in Sonora, another 50 were evacuated from a fishing camp in Guaymas. Meanwhile, the SMN issued tropical storm warnings along the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> coast, as well as hurricane watches and warnings around the entire Gulf of California between Santa Rosalía, <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Sur, and Bahía Kino, Sonora.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Two {{intensified}} over open waters, the season's third {{storm was}} identified on August9. Initially tracking westward, the hurricane turned sharply north, maintaining an intensity of 85mph (140km/h) during its known existence. Briefly slowing on August11, the system quickly picked up forward speed {{as it turned}} northwestward, paralleling the coastline of the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Peninsula. On August14, the hurricane turned north once more; however, it lost its identity the following day {{off the coast of}} <b>Baja</b> <b>California.</b>|$|E
5|$|August 20–21, 1921: A {{tropical}} cyclone moved north from <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> and into Arizona, producing rain in both southern California and Arizona.|$|E
5|$|Branches of the Mexican Red Cross in Guerrero, Oaxaca and Michoacán {{were put}} on alert. The organization's {{national}} emergency response team was on stand-by to assist the most affected areas. Navy helicopters delivered food and water to remote areas of the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> peninsula. The Mexican Red Cross dispatched 2,000food parcels to {{the southern tip of}} <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Sur. In the city of Mulegé, gas supply, which was necessary to run generators, was low, drinking water was gone, and the airstrip was covered with mud. Many homeless residents initially stayed with friends or in government-run shelters. Throughout the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> peninsula, thousands remained without water or electricity two days after the storm, although a pilot from Phoenix prepared to fly to the disaster area with 100gallons (380litres) of water. Other pilots were expected to execute similar flights, as well. The office of <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Sur Tourism stated that minimal damage occurred to the tourism infrastructure, with only minimal delays to airports, roads, and maritime facilities. The Episcopal Relief and Development delivered food, clothing, medicine, and transportation to about 100families, and gave mattresses to about 80families.|$|E

5|$|Following Greg's formation, a {{tropical}} storm warning was issued for the coast of Mexico from Manzanillo, Colima to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, including Islas Marías. The warning was extended to include Lázaro Cárdenas a few hours later. On September6, {{a tropical}} storm warning was issued for locations south of La Paz {{on the east coast}} of <b>Baja</b> <b>California,</b> while {{a tropical storm}} watch was hoisted for areas south of Punta Abreojos on the west coast. A tropical storm warning was then issued for the west coast of <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> south of Cabo San Lázaro. As Greg intensified, a hurricane warning was raised from Arroyo Seco southward, and for the east coast of <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> from La Paz southward. A tropical storm watch was raised from north of La Paz to Loreto. Late on September7, the hurricane warning was reduced to a tropical storm warning as Greg weakened. The watches and warnings were lifted from the east coast of <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> early on September8, and they were subsequently lifted for all areas a few hours later.|$|E
5|$|H. l. leucocephalus (Linnaeus, 1766) is the {{nominate}} subspecies. It {{is found}} in the southern United States and <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Initially, some {{forecasts}} {{predicted the}} storm would strike the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Peninsula as {{a tropical storm}}; a tropical storm watch was briefly issued from Sante Fe to Cabo San Lucas accordingly. Over 100 shelters were opened in the municipalities of Los Cabos, La Paz and Comondú, respectively. In all, Ivo contributed to heavy rainfall across <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Sur; however, damage was not reported.|$|E
5|$|La Reforma is a Plio-Pleistocene caldera on the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Peninsula in Mexico. It is part {{of eleven}} volcanoes in <b>Baja</b> <b>California,</b> which formed with the Gulf of California during the Miocene, about ten million years ago. Previously, a {{volcanic}} arc had existed on the peninsula. The caldera's basement consists of granites and monzonites, formed between the Cretaceous and the Middle Miocene.|$|E
5|$|Nora took {{an unusual}} path, making {{landfall}} twice as a hurricane in <b>Baja</b> <b>California.</b> Weakening quickly after landfall, its remnants lashed the Southwestern United States with tropical-storm-force winds, torrential rain and flooding. The storm was blamed for two direct casualties in Mexico, {{as well as}} substantial beach erosion on the Mexican coast, flash flooding in <b>Baja</b> <b>California,</b> and record precipitation in Arizona. It persisted far inland and eventually dissipated near the Arizona–Nevada border.|$|E
5|$|Prior to landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{initially}} forecast Rick {{to make landfall}} {{in southern}} <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> as a high-end Category2 hurricane, prompting hurricane watches. Officials ordered several hundred residents to evacuate from low-lying areas, although tropical storm warnings replaced the hurricane watches after the storm had weakened. Overall, the damage from Rick was significantly less than initially anticipated. In Mexico, three people {{were killed by the}} storm, one in Oaxaca and two in <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Sur.|$|E
5|$|September 12, 1958– A {{tropical}} storm dissipated over <b>Baja</b> <b>California,</b> spreading rainfall into the state.|$|E

5|$|The black-throated gray warbler breeds {{in western}} North America, its range {{extending}} from southwestern British Columbia along the Pacific coast to northern <b>Baja</b> <b>California,</b> and east to New Mexico and southern Montana. It winters mostly in Mexico, from southern <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> to Oaxaca state. It has spread into parts of Wyoming and Montana only recently, as Juniperus osteosperma {{has expanded its}} range due to a warming climate. Vagrants have been recorded across eastern North America and in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Georgette was a {{short-lived}} tropical storm that struck the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Sur in September 2010. Georgette originated {{from an area}} of disturbed weather over the eastern Pacific on September20. The next day, the system was upgraded into a tropical storm a short distance south of <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Sur. As the storm moved over the peninsula, it weakened to a topical depression. It continued north and as such made landfall on mainland Mexico on September22. Georgette dissipated early the next day while located inland over Sonora. Although officials noted the threat for heavy rainfall across northwest Mexico and <b>Baja</b> <b>California,</b> damage was minimal and no deaths were reported in the country. However, remnant moisture moved into New Mexico, producing flooding that killed one person.|$|E
5|$|A. r. sororia was {{described}} by Robert Ridgway in 1898, and {{is found in the}} mountains of southern <b>Baja</b> <b>California,</b> specifically the Sierra de la Laguna. It is the palest of the coastal subspecies.|$|E
5|$|After no {{tropical}} cyclone activity in July and August, the third tropical storm formed offshore of southwestern Mexico on September3. Like {{the previous two}} {{tropical cyclone}}, this storm had a peak of 50mph (80km/h), and did not intensify further. Tropical Storm Three headed northwestward, and began paralleling the coast of <b>Baja</b> <b>California.</b> On September8, Tropical Storm Three turned abruptly south-southwestward, and dissipated by the next day. The outer rainbands of this system were expected to bring squally weather over the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Peninsula; instead, this storm turned away without causing any impact.|$|E
5|$|Although Darby {{remained}} well offshore, the large {{size of the}} hurricane's circulation prompted the government of Mexico to issue tropical storm warnings for {{the southern tip of}} <b>Baja</b> <b>California.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because Howard {{remained}} {{away from}} land no tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued. One ship, the Strong Virginian, reported sustained winds 42mph (68km/h) at 0600UTC on September4. Along the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Peninsula, 1618ft (4.85.4m) swells were reported. All ships {{were required to}} remain at port due to the rough seas. Heavy rains in the mountainous and Pacific coastal areas of <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> produced flooding which washed out several roads in San José del Cabo. The rains did help increase water levels in some reservoirs in <b>Baja</b> <b>California.</b> An estimated 2,000 hectares of agricultural land was damaged by the storm and 48 households were damaged throughout four communities. State and federal authorities purchased temporary homes for those who needed shelter in the affected areas. The State Civil Protection in Mexico provided rehabilitation {{for a total of}} 393 homes affected by Howard.|$|E
5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} National Hurricane Center's first {{advisory}} on Isis, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Dolores to Puerto Cortés along the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Peninsula. This helped some of the residents get an early start.Early on September 2, the warning was extended from Santa Rosalía to Punta Abreojos, while an additional tropical storm warning was issued from El Dorado to Guaymas. After Isis became a hurricane, officials issued a hurricane warning from Dolores to Punta San Gabriel on the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Peninsula and from El Dorado to Bahía Kino on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Five people drowned {{after their}} cars were {{swept away by}} floodwaters while trying to cross a flooded stream. The floods also damaged 4,000-6,000 homes and {{buildings}} and significantly disrupted water and communications {{for an extended period}} of time. The hurricane's storm surge damaged many boats and yachts in ports along the peninsula's coast, most of them beyond repair. Minor beach erosion was reported at San Felipe, <b>Baja</b> <b>California.</b> As a result, the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Sur municipalities of La Paz, Los Cabos, Loreto, Comondú, and Mulegé were declared national disaster areas. 6,000 people were affected and total damage from the storm was $100 million.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Blanca was the {{earliest}} recorded tropical cyclone {{to make landfall}} in <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> in any given year. Forming as a tropical depression on May31, Blanca initially struggled to organize due to strong wind shear. However, once this abated, the system took advantage of high sea surface temperatures and ample moisture. After becoming a tropical storm on June1, Blanca rapidly intensified on June2–3, becoming a powerful Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; maximum sustained winds reached 145mph (230km/h) at this time. The hurricane's slow motion resulted in tremendous upwelling of cooler water, resulting {{in a period of}} weakening. Blanca gradually recovered from this and briefly regained Category4 status on June6 as it moved generally northwest toward the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> peninsula. Cooler waters and increased shear again prompted weakening on June7 and the system struck <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Sur on June8 as a weak tropical storm. It quickly degraded to a depression and dissipated early the next day.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ignacio {{continued}} to quickly intensify after becoming a hurricane, and reached peak winds of 105mph (165km/h) later on August 24 while located within 30miles (48km/h) {{off the coast}} of <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Sur. Upon reaching peak strength, the hurricane possessed a 12mile (19km) wide eye surrounded by very deep convection. The National Hurricane Center predicted it to attain major hurricane status and potentially reach significantly higher winds if the center remained over open water. However, it turned to the northwest and paralleled the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Peninsula a short distance offshore, resulting in a steady weakening trend due to its interaction with the high terrain. On August 25 Ignacio made landfall just east of La Paz with winds of 80mph (130km/h). It rapidly weakened over land, first deteriorating to a tropical storm 12hours after landfall and later to a tropical depression about a day after moving ashore. Ignacio continued northwestward across the peninsula, and dissipated on August 28 while located in northwestern <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Sur.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane John was the {{eleventh}} named storm, seventh hurricane, and fifth major hurricane of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. Hurricane John developed on August 28 from a tropical wave {{to the south}} of Mexico. Favorable conditions allowed the storm to intensify quickly, and it attained peak winds of 135mph (215km/h) on August 30. Eyewall replacement cycles and land interaction with western Mexico weakened the hurricane, and John made landfall on southeastern <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Sur with winds of 110mph (180km/h) on September 1. It slowly weakened as it moved northwestward through the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> peninsula, and dissipated on September 4. Moisture from the remnants of the storm entered the southwest United States.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Odile is {{tied for}} the most intense landfalling {{tropical}} cyclone on the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Peninsula during the satellite era. Sweeping across the peninsula in September2014, Odile inflicted widespread damage, particularly {{in the state of}} <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Sur, in addition to causing lesser impacts on the Mexican mainland and Southwestern United States. The precursor to Odile developed into a tropical depression south of Mexico on September10 and quickly reached tropical storm strength. After meandering for several days, Odile began to track northwestward, intensifying to hurricane status before rapidly reaching its Category4 hurricane peak intensity on September14. The cyclone slightly weakened before making landfall near Cabo San Lucas with winds of 125mph (205km/h). Odile gradually weakened as it tracked across the length of the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Peninsula, briefly crossing into the Gulf of California before degenerating into a remnant system on September17. These remnants tracked northeastward across the Southwestern United States before they were no longer identifiable on September19.|$|E
5|$|In Odile's {{developmental}} stage, {{its heavy}} rainfall and storm surge inflicted minor coastal damage across southwestern Mexico and three deaths in Oaxaca and Jalisco. The most significant storm impacts {{occurred on the}} <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Peninsula, where damages amounted to approximately MXN$16.6billion (US$1.22billion). Power outages spurred by Odile's intense winds and rain cut electricity to 92%of the population of <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Sur. Severe flooding also occurred, causing rivers to swell and the mass evacuation {{of people out of}} hazardous low-lying areas. The remnants of Odile brought rains and unseasonably powerful thunderstorms to the southwestern United States. In total, Odile led to the deaths of 18people throughout its nine-day existence.|$|E
5|$|In all, Hurricane John {{destroyed}} {{hundreds of}} houses and blew off {{the roofs of}} 160houses on the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> peninsula. Five people were killed, and damage in Mexico amounted to $663million (2006MXN, $60.8million 2006USD).|$|E
5|$|Malcolm J. Rogers {{suggested}} that early highstands of Lake Cahuilla had strong {{effects on the}} spread of ceramics {{in the region of}} California and <b>Baja</b> <b>California,</b> though this is considered untenable today.|$|E
5|$|Nora {{killed two}} in Mexico: an {{electrocution}} by a downed power line in Mexicali, <b>Baja</b> <b>California,</b> and a diver caught in strong underwater currents created by Nora {{off the coast}} of the San Quintin Valley.|$|E
5|$|On July8, Tropical Storm Willa {{developed}} {{south of}} the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> peninsula. It maintained a west-northwestward track throughout its duration, remaining a minimal tropical storm. On July10, the storm dissipated.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone watches and warnings were issued with {{the declaration of}} tropical storm warnings and hurricane watches along portions of {{the east and west}} coasts of the <b>Baja</b> <b>California</b> Peninsula. For several days the advisories were adjusted and amended, and on October 1, a hurricane warning was posted for the west coast of <b>Baja</b> <b>California,</b> from Agua Blanca to San Andresito. By October 2, all watches and warnings were discontinued on the east coast of the peninsula, and the remaining advisories were lifted the next day. High winds and heavy rainfall were anticipated.|$|E
