25|$|Maria Nikolaievna {{was raised}} in the company of her sisters Olga and Alexandra. Their rooms, located {{on the ground floor of}} the Winter Palace, were unpretentious and void of luxury. The girls were {{prescribed}} fresh air in all seasons, and doctors controlled their diet. Classes began at 8:00 AM. Maria’s education was placed under the supervision of the liberal privy Counselor and poet Vasily Zhukovsky, who had previously been Alexandra Feodorovna’s Russian teacher. Zhukovsky remained in close terms with his royal wards until his death. Maria and her sisters received dancing, music and drawing lessons. Her childhood sketchbook (1826–1830) has survived and it is in the hands of her descendants living in the United States. Grand Duchess Maria, who painted fairly well, later made watercolors. She never lost her love for the arts, becoming a benefactress and art collector. Artistically gifted, she showed an early interest in interior design, decorating her rooms with her personal style. She would later make her Palace in St Petersburg one of the most <b>beautiful</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city. All three sisters had musical abilities and were involved in charitable work. From 1835, Grand Duchess Maria was an active member of the patriots' society, which had been founded by Empress Elizabeth Alexeievna.
