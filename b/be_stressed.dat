5|$|Orm was {{concerned}} with priests' ability to speak the vernacular, and developed an idiosyncratic spelling system to guide his readers in the pronunciation of the vowels. He used a strict poetic metre to ensure that readers know which syllables are to <b>be</b> <b>stressed.</b> Modern scholars use these two features to reconstruct Middle English as Orm spoke it (Burchfield 1987, p.280).|$|E
5|$|Dispatch {{is notable}} {{for its use}} of, and the sole {{surviving}} remains of, Fell's Patent Knees. These were a patent innovation from 1839 by Jonathan Fell of Workington, Cumberland, and {{were part of the}} development of the iron and wood composite hull. Ships before this had been built from oak, where the strong curved brackets needed to join the deck into the hull side frames could be found as naturally grown 'knees' from the angles between major branches and the trunk. In the post-Nelsonic era there was a general shortage of shipbuilding timber, particularly oak, one of the few species with strong enough branch attachments to provide knees. Dispatch's hull is of pine, which has weak branches. A number of iron substitutes were developed, Fell's design being one of the later and more advanced forms. It had two advantages over earlier rigid-forged patterns: it provided a degree of flexibility in storms and, most significantly, could <b>be</b> <b>stressed</b> after the hull had been constructed and launched or even loaded, when the hull was under its working load. Together with the diagonal iron strapping, this rendered Dispatch's hull particularly strong and had allowed her to endure at least two collisions.|$|E
5|$|The brigade was {{organized}} as a training brigade preparing Army Reserve and Army National Guard units for deployment. The brigade prepares other units for mobilization and provides training, assistance, {{and support to}} them during pre-deployment exercises, and evaluates performance and progress of these units as they are deploying. Since its reactivation, the brigade has specialized in training provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs) deploying to Afghanistan. In early 2007, the 189th Infantry Brigade, along with the 158th Infantry Brigade, cooperated to train the first 12 PRTs at once at Fort Bragg for three-month training exercises. PRT personnel were trained {{in a wide range}} of scenarios, ranging from hospital repairs to childbirth scenarios and language labs.Afterwards, they conducted a conference on the training, in which it was decided that cultural awareness and language training needed to <b>be</b> <b>stressed</b> for future PRTs. It was during this training that the brigade finally received its distinctive unit insignia and shoulder sleeve insignia on 25 May 2008. In early 2008, the Brigade began training another group of 12 PRTs. Several months later, the Brigades began training the next 12 PRTs for a 270-day deployment to Afghanistan.|$|E

25|$|Written accents {{are also}} used {{occasionally}} in poetry and scripts for dramatic performances to indicate that a certain normally unstressed syllable in a word should <b>be</b> <b>stressed</b> for dramatic effect, or to keep with the metre of the poetry.

50|$|Huenergard (2005:3-4) {{claims that}} <b>stress</b> in Akkadian <b>is</b> {{completely}} predictable. In his syllable typology {{there are three}} syllable weights: light (V, CV); heavy (CVC, CV̄, CV̂), and superheavy (CV̂C). If the last syllable is superheavy, it <b>is</b> <b>stressed,</b> otherwise the rightmost heavy syllable <b>is</b> <b>stressed.</b> If a word contains only light syllables, the first syllable <b>is</b> <b>stressed.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{placement}} of stress {{did not change}} from Classical to Vulgar Latin, and words continued to <b>be</b> <b>stressed</b> on the same syllable they were before. However, the loss of distinctive length disrupted the correlation between syllable weight and stress placement that existed in Classical Latin. Where in Classical Latin {{the place of the}} accent was predictable from the structure of the word, it was no longer so in Vulgar Latin. Stress had become a phonological property and could serve to distinguish forms that were otherwise homophones.|$|E
25|$|The Mont'e Prama scarab was {{considered}} by archaeologists {{to be made}} of ivory or bone, but recent archaeometric analyses make it clear that it is a glazed steatite of Egyptian origin. Careful typological considerations showed that it is a true Egyptian scarab, picturing a stylized lotus ﬂower and dated to 1130-945 BC. Nevertheless, it must <b>be</b> <b>stressed</b> that dating sites and monuments through scarabs is scarcely reliable, given that these small objects can remain in use for many centuries after their production, as demonstrated in several cases.|$|E
25|$|Naultinus {{are also}} kept in captivity by enthusiasts in {{overseas}} countries {{but it should}} <b>be</b> <b>stressed</b> that trade is incredibly difficult, and one must obtain adequate CITES permits for importation and exportation. This process is regulated by the CITES Management Authority, which ascertains whether or not founding stock were obtained by a keeper in a particular country prior to 1981. This is often quite difficult, and usually prohibitive of international trade between Europe (where most stock resides outside of New Zealand) and other countries.|$|E

25|$|The phrases are {{mentioned}} with accents to show where <b>stress</b> <b>is</b> placed. In Latin, most words <b>are</b> <b>stressed</b> at the second-last (penultimate) syllable, called in Latin paenultima or syllaba paenultima. A few words <b>are</b> <b>stressed</b> at the third-last syllable, called in Latin antepaenultima or syllaba antepaenultima.|$|R
25|$|Emphasis and {{contrast}} may override normal stress. Pronouns frequently take stress because of this. In {{a simple question}} like Ĉu vi vídis? ('Did you see?'), the pronoun hardly {{needs to be said}} and is unstressed; compare Né, dónu al mí and ('No, give me). Within a word, a prefix that wasn't heard correctly may <b>be</b> <b>stressed</b> upon repetition: Né, ne tíen! Iru máldekstren, mi diris! ('No, not over there! Go left, I said!'). Because stress doesn't distinguish words in Esperanto, shifting it to an unexpected syllable calls attention to that syllable, but doesn't cause confusion as it might in English.|$|E
25|$|Critics of the Ichthyostraca {{hypothesis}} {{have pointed}} out that even parasitic crustaceans can still be recognised as crustaceans based on their larvae; but that tongue worms and their larvae do not express typical characters for Crustacea or even Euarthropoda. An alternative model notes the extremely ancient Cambrian origins of these animals and interprets tongue worms as stem-group arthropods. A recent morphological analysis recovered Pentastomida outside the arthropods, as sister group to a clade including nematodes, priapulids and similar ecdysozoan 'worm' groups. Adding fossils, they suggested an extinct animal called Facivermis could be closely related to tongue worms. However it should <b>be</b> <b>stressed</b> that these authors did not explicitly test pentastomid/crustacean relationships.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to studying an easier {{version of the}} yeshiva curriculum, the mechina also featured secular studies, another innovation at the time. This was cause for opposition {{from the ranks of}} many rabbis, who were unaccustomed to the idea of secular studies occupying a position in any form of yeshiva. In 1924, however, the Lithuanian government announced its decision to accredit only those rabbinical colleges that possessed a secular studies department. The Rabbinical College of Telshe was the only such institute. It is to <b>be</b> <b>stressed,</b> though, that secular studies did not occupy a place in the yeshiva itself, but only in its mechina.|$|E

50|$|The {{predominant}} {{stress pattern}} in Polish <b>is</b> penultimate <b>stress</b> - {{in a word}} {{of more than one}} syllable, the next-to-last syllable <b>is</b> <b>stressed.</b> Alternating preceding syllables carry secondary stress, e.g. in a four-syllable word, where the primary <b>stress</b> <b>is</b> on the third syllable, there will <b>be</b> secondary <b>stress</b> on the first.|$|R

25|$|As {{a result}} of his {{determination}} to accomplish great victories Haig too often disregarded key factors such as weather, and the condition of the battlefield, placed his objectives beyond the range which his artillery could cover and incorporated in his schemes a role for cavalry which this arm was helpless to accomplish. These shortcomings, it needs to <b>be</b> <b>stressed,</b> were not at all peculiar to Haig.... But the outcome, too often, was British operations directed towards unrealizable objectives and persisted in long after they had ceased to serve any worthwhile purpose. The consequence was excessive loss of British lives, insubstantial accomplishment, and waning morale.|$|E
25|$|Further to {{what has}} been {{mentioned}} it should <b>be</b> <b>stressed</b> that a good well-aged pu'er tea is not evaluated by its age alone. Like all things in life, there will come a time when a pu'er teacake reaches its peak before stumbling into a decline. Due to the many recipes and different processing method used in the production of different batches of pu'er, the optimal age for each age will vary. Some may take 10 years while others 20 or 30+ years. It is important to check the status of ageing for your teacakes to know when they peaked so that proper care can be given to halt the ageing process.|$|E
25|$|Divers {{must avoid}} {{injuries}} caused {{by changes in}} pressure. The weight of the water column above the diver causes an increase in pressure in proportion to depth, {{in the same way}} that the weight of the column of atmospheric air above the surface causes a pressure of 101.3 kPa (14.7 pounds-force per square inch) at sea level. This variation of pressure with depth will cause compressible materials and gas filled spaces to tend to change volume, which can cause the surrounding material or tissues to <b>be</b> <b>stressed,</b> with the risk of injury if the stress gets too high. Pressure injuries are called barotrauma and can be quite painful, even potentially fatal – in severe cases causing a ruptured lung, eardrum or damage to the sinuses. To avoid barotrauma, the diver equalises the pressure in all air spaces with the surrounding water pressure when changing depth. The middle ear and sinus are equalised using one or more of several techniques, which is referred to as clearing the ears.|$|E
50|$|Stress patternsPrimary <b>stress</b> in Tawbuid <b>is</b> either final or penultimate. Most words <b>are</b> <b>stressed</b> unpredictably, {{and in some}} speakers, all {{syllable}}s seem to <b>be</b> equally <b>stressed.</b> Modification in stress {{occurs in}} affective speech (see below). Some syllable patterns have predictable stress. A word containing two adjacent syllables with CVC patterns <b>are</b> <b>stressed</b> on the second of those two syllables, whether final or not.|$|R
50|$|It {{does not}} appear that <b>stress</b> <b>is</b> phonemic, {{but this is not}} certain.

25|$|While the theorem {{that now}} {{bears his name}} was known and {{previously}} utilised by the Babylonians and Indians, he, or his students, are often said to have constructed the first proof. It must, however, <b>be</b> <b>stressed</b> that {{the way in which}} the Babylonians handled Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) cuneiform sources. Because of the secretive nature of his school and the custom of its students to attribute everything to their teacher, there is no evidence that Pythagoras himself worked on or proved this theorem. For that matter, there is no evidence that he worked on any mathematical or meta-mathematical problems. Some attribute it as a carefully constructed myth by followers of Plato over two centuries after the death of Pythagoras, mainly to bolster the case for Platonic meta-physics, which resonate well with the ideas they attributed to Pythagoras. This attribution has stuck down the centuries up to modern times. The earliest known mention of Pythagoras's name in connection with the theorem occurred five centuries after his death, in the writings of Cicero and Plutarch.|$|E
25|$|The {{armament}} of the Phalangites {{is described}} in the Military Decree of Amphipolis. It lists the fines imposed upon the soldiers who fail to maintain their armament or produce it upon demand. Offensive weapons were a pike (sarissa), and a short sword (machaira). The sarissa was over 6m (18ft) in length, with a counterweight and spiked end at the rear called a sauroter; {{it seems to have}} had an iron sleeve in the middle which may mean that it was in two pieces for the march with the sleeve joining the two sections before use. Like the xyston, the sarissa was greatly tapered towards the point. This, along with the sauroter, helped to make the point of balance as far towards the butt of the weapon as possible. It should <b>be</b> <b>stressed</b> that the archaeological discoveries show that the phalangites also used the two-edged sword (xiphos) as well as the traditional Greek hoplite spear (doru/δόρυ), which was much shorter than the sarissa. The sources also indicate that the phalangites were on occasion armed with javelins. The sarissa would have been useless in siege warfare and other combat situations requiring a less cumbersome weapon.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the indigenous Indian architecture which was of the trabeate order, i.e. all spaces were spanned by means of horizontal beams, the Islamic architecture was arcuate, i.e. an arch or dome was adopted {{as a method of}} bridging a space. The concept of arch or dome was not invented by the Muslims but was, in fact, borrowed and further perfected by them from the architectural styles of the post-Roman period. Muslims used a cementing agent in the form of mortar {{for the first time in}} the construction of buildings in India. They further put to use certain scientific and mechanical formulae, which were derived by experience of other civilisations, in their constructions in India. Such use of scientific principles helped not only in obtaining greater strength and stability of the construction materials but also provided greater flexibility to the architects and builders. One fact that must <b>be</b> <b>stressed</b> here is that, the Islamic elements of architecture had already passed through different experimental phases in other countries like Egypt, Iran and Iraq before these were introduced in India. Unlike most Islamic monuments in these countries, which were largely constructed in brick, plaster and rubble, the Indo-Islamic monuments were typical mortar-masonry works formed of dressed stones. It must be emphasized that the development of the Indo-Islamic architecture was greatly facilitated by the knowledge and skill possessed by the Indian craftsmen, who had mastered the art of stonework for centuries and used their experience while constructing Islamic monuments in India.|$|E
