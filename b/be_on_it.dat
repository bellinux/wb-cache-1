In 1994, Michael Howard decided to compile a select list of about 20 prisoners serving life sentences who must never be released, and Straffen's name was said to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> The whole list was published by the News of the World in December 1997; this report confirmed that Straffen would indeed {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison.|$|E
500|$|The {{collaboration}} {{was originally}} {{planned to be}} a remix of the song, while the solo version would have been included on Rihanna's fifth studio album Loud. However, {{in the end it}} made the final cut on the album. Regarding Drake's inclusion on the song, Rihanna told MTV News, [...] "Drake is the hottest rapper out right now and we've always been trying to work together." [...] According to her, when he heard the song he liked it and wrote his verse after three days. Rihanna has further described the song as very youthful, playful and very melodic track; according to her that's why Drake was the perfect choice to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "cause he's a young rapper who has incredible melodies". [...] "What's My Name?" [...] was released as the second single from Loud; it was sent to contemporary hit and rhythmic radio in the United States on October 26, 2010. The single was made available for digital download on November 12 via the iTunes Store. A CD single featuring the song and a remix of it was released on January 21, 2011 in Germany.|$|E
50|$|While Stacy <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the show, she {{eventually}} {{went from being}} the youngest to the oldest and holds {{the record for the}} longest run <b>on</b> <b>it</b> having <b>been</b> <b>on</b> for six seasons, including the pilot. Moosie Drier was part of the cast for five seasons. Renee Sands, Rahsaan Patterson, Kenny Ford, and Ryan Lambert <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> for four seasons each. Several of the other actors, however, like Eric Balfour, Jared Delgin, and Jerry Sharell, left it after only one season. Sharell's departure was said to be due to creative differences with producers Thomas W. Lynch and Gary Biller. In particular, he was unhappy with the show's often bizarre and outlandish story lines. Connie, Devyn, and Jennifer <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> for two seasons each. Martika, Richie, and Sean O'Riordan <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> for three seasons.|$|R

500|$|The {{outcome of}} the 1894 {{elections}} made it increasingly likely that a Republican {{would be the next}} president. At the time, the presidential nominating process started much later than it subsequently would, and McKinley, in quietly organizing his campaign with Hanna's aid in the early months of 1895, was alone among the candidates in acting so early. Other potential Republican candidates were former president Harrison, incoming Speaker of the House Thomas Brackett Reed of Maine, Iowa Senator William B. Allison, and several state favorite sons, such as Illinois Senator Shelby Cullom. If former president Harrison entered the race, he would immediately become a major contender, and uncertainty over his status hung over the race in 1895. At the time, unless there was an incumbent elected Republican president, the nomination was generally not decided until the convention, with state political bosses and delegates exacting a price for their support. A candidate's efforts to gain the nomination did not begin until shortly before the state delegate conventions in the spring of the election year, where fights over the makeup of the delegation often focused on who would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> rather than who delegates would support. McKinley and Hanna decided on a systematic nationwide effort to gain the nomination, employing what onetime presidential adviser Karl Rove—author of a 2015 book on the 1896 race—called [...] "the first modern primary campaign".|$|E
500|$|On February 12, 2012, Lil' Wayne {{said that}} Christina Milian had joined Young Money, and will release her fourth album through Young Money Entertainment. The next day, a song titled [...] "Mr. Valentine" [...] leaked onto the internet. Milian told Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio. [...] "Yeah, I've signed with Young Money. It was pretty awesome. This weekend {{we had a}} big party, a big YMCMB party, and Drake was {{performing}} and we were all up on the stage and Wayne got up there and he announced it himself. And so I was kind of surprised and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is awesome!'" [...] Milian is currently recording her fourth album. [...] "We're just getting started on it," [...] she said. [...] "I've already halfway gotten there and when my mom and I went to Wayne and we played him some of the music, off the second song, he was like, 'I love it. Let's do this deal.' I have some music that's already going to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> and the second half I'm working with them now. [...] When they did a little background check, they saw even the songwriting, {{all that kind of stuff}} adds on top of, alright, she's an actress, she's a pretty face, she can actually sing, but not to mention she's a songwriter. I thought that was cool that they even saw that. [...] They all get on each other's records, so all I have to do is be home with everybody and we'll just do lots of features." ...|$|E
500|$|Shonda Rhimes, series' creator, {{says that}} the {{character}} was envisioned [...] "an old-fashioned tortured hero" [...] and likens him to Heathcliff. Originally set to appear in a multi-episode story arc, Kevin McKidd's contract was extended, securing him a slot as a series' regular of Grey's Anatomy. In July 2008, Entertainment Weekly announced the possibility of McKidd becoming a series' regular, with this possibility eventually being confirmed by People. When asked of how he got involved with the show, McKidd offered the insight: [...] McKidd told BuddyTV, [...] "It's been really great. I was nervous when I started because every job I've ever done before this, I {{have been in the}} job right from day one when everybody's new and getting to know each other. So I was nervous because I had never done this before. And I feel really grateful to the Grey's cast and crew and everyone there, really, because they've been so nice to me and gracious and accepting of me joining the show. The transition was much easier than I thought it might be, which I'm very grateful for." [...] McKidd has told People that he thinks Grey's Anatomy is a great show and he feels lucky to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, said of his addition, [...] "I am excited to have Kevin McKidd joining us for the season, he's been a delight to collaborate with and brings incredible passion, talent and creativity to his work. Plus, he’s already got the ‘Mc’ built into his name so we had to keep him." ...|$|E

500|$|In a late July debate {{sponsored}} by the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, Bevin continued {{to insist that the}} state could not afford the Medicaid expansion authorized by Governor Beshear. He said he was [...] "appalled that one in four Kentuckians now get their health insurance from Medicaid". He then advocated modifying the state's Medicaid system to require those insured by Medicaid to contribute small premiums or co-payments, citing a system similar to Indiana's. The Kentucky General Assembly would have to effect such changes through legislation, but the debate moderator told Bevin he could end the expansion entirely with an executive order. Bevin responded, [...] "And create what degree of chaos?" [...] Alessi then cited Bevin's February promise to end the Medicaid expansion [...] "immediately", to which Bevin replied, [...] "I said I would address it. I didn't say I would end it immediately. Go back and look at what I said." [...] In the post-debate press conference, Lexington Herald-Leader columnist Sam Youngman confirmed that Bevin had said he would [...] "end" [...] the Medicaid expansion. Bevin then said, [...] "Yeah, well, here's the bottom line: We need to address the situation. We need to effectively come up with a program that works for folks." [...] At a September campaign stop at a local Dairy Queen, Bevin promised only to [...] "tweak" [...] Beshear's Medicaid expansion. Later in the month, he told a reporter [...] "e will not continue to enroll people at 138 percent of the federal poverty level ," [...] adding [...] "The bottom line is this: Even if we don't continue to enroll people at 138 percent, there will be the 850-some odd thousand that were on it before the expansion and the other 400-and some odd thousand that are on it right now. They will continue to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> until we come up with a solution. But {{we are not going to}} re-enroll people at 138 percent." [...] In an email to reporters, Bevin's communications director said, [...] "Matt has been consistent on the issue of Medicaid expansion from day one. What he has called for is repeal of Obama's Medicaid expansion by applying to [...] for 1115 waivers (as other states have successfully done) in order to better customize a solution to address the healthcare needs of the commonwealth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rachael Blampied had auditioned 5 {{times for}} Shortland Street, with her last being {{for the role}} of Zlata Waldheim. However Blampied was turned down every time as she looked too similar to one of the core actresses, Beth Allen (who portrayed Brooke Freeman). After she auditioned {{for the role of}} Zlata, {{producers}} decided to utilise their similarities and create the role of Bree – a sister for Brooke, specifically for her. Blampied received a call in mid-2011 asking if she was eager to accept the role. She was extremely pleased with the call, saying; [...] "It's the best phone call an actor can wish for – that they're writing a part for you on a show you really want to <b>be</b> <b>on.</b> <b>It</b> was a complete surprise and totally out of the blue." [...] The character was originally planned to appear nicer but end up being [...] "badder" [...] than Brooke. Blampied started filming her scenes in October 2011. Blampied found her first day of work similar to walking [...] "into a beast" [...] and although she was nervous, she found it was like [...] "a family". In November TVNZ announced that a new addition would be arriving to Brooke's dysfunctional family, with Bree arriving on 9 December. Blampied enjoyed working alongside her screen sister, Allen and Pua Magasiva (who portrayed Brooke's boyfriend Vinnie), saying; [...] "I've had some great scenes with Beth and Pua, which have been enormous fun as they're such generous actors and are heaps of fun to hang out with!" [...] The character was originally envisioned to be killed off {{at the end of her}} stint, but producers were so impressed with Blampied that they rewrote the characters ending by sending her to a psychiatric hospital. Blampied was not aware as to what Bree was to endure throughout her stint but was informed that she was always going to leave after her initial storyline came to an end. She was sad to leave the soap but pleased with her exit, [...] "I was sad to have to leave the show, but it's not a closed exit. One of the writers said to me on my last day, 'Well it's always good to have a crazy in the cupboard.'" [...] Bree made her last appearance on 25 September 2012.|$|E
