The ratio of influent to effluent COD was determined at different retention times. The results indicated that the removal efficiency of each selected compound is affected by the detention time. At low phenol and hydroquinone concentration (from 700 to 1000 mg/L) maximum removal efficiency (over 80 %) was obtained. By further increasing in COD loading rate up to 3000 mg/L, a decrease in COD removal rate was occurred.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade new {{technologies}} are emerging even more for wastewater treatment. Among the new technologies, a recent possible solution regards Moving Bed <b>Biofilm</b> <b>Reactors</b> (MBBRs) that represent an effective alternative to conventional processes. More specifically such systems consist in the introduction of plastic elements inside the aerobic reactor as carrier material {{for the growth of}} attached biomass. Recently, one of the mostly used alternatives is to couple the Moving Bed <b>Biofilm</b> <b>Reactor</b> (MBBR) <b>process</b> with the conventional activated sludge process, and the resulting process is usually called HMBBR (Hybrid MBBR). In the MBBR process the biofilm grows attached on small plastic elements that are kept in constant motion throughout the entire volume of the reactor. Indeed, in such a system, a competition between the two biomasses, suspended and attached, can arise for the availability of the substrates, leading, as a consequence, to a modification in the biokinetic parameters of the two biomasses, compared to that of a pure suspended or attached biomass process. This paper presents the first results of a study aimed at estimating the kinetic heterotrophic constants in a HMBBR pilot plant using respirometric techniques.

40|$|Phosphorus (P) and {{nitrogen}} (N) removal from municipal wastewater is performed {{to prevent or}} reduce eutrophication in the receiving water. Both P and N can be removed physical/chemically as well as biologically. While biological processes have always dominated in N-removal, chemical P-removal is used in many cases. Biological P-removal using {{enhanced biological phosphorus removal}} (EBPR) is normally carried out in suspended culture (activated sludge) processes while biological N-removal (through nitrification and denitrification) can be done in biofilm processes as well. There are, however, potential advantages related to sludge separation and required reactor volumes, which suggest that a pure biofilm process can be an interesting alternative to activated sludge for biological phosphorus {{and nitrogen}} removal. The scope {{of this study was to}} investigate use of the moving bed <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> (MBBR) <b>process</b> for biological phosphorus removal. The goal has been to describe the operating conditions required for biological phosphorus and nitrogen removal in a MBBR operated as a sequencing batch reactor (SBR), and determine dimensioning criteria for such a process. Laboratory scale experiments were performed with constructed wastewater and verified in experiments with municipal wastewater. The results showed that biological phosphorus and nitrogen removal can be achieved in a moving bed <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> operated as a SBR. The required operating conditions will be dependant on the wastewater quality.

It follows that an improved capacity to model a <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> does not necessarily rely on an improved biofilm model, but does rely on an improved mathematical description of the <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> and its components. Existing <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> models typically include a one-dimensional biofilm model, a process (biokinetic and stoichiometric) model, and a continuous flow stirred tank reactor (CFSTR) mass balance that [when organizing CFSTRs in series] creates a pseudo two-dimensional (2 -D) model of bulk-liquid hydrodynamics approaching plug flow. In such a <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> model, the user-defined biofilm area is specified for each CFSTR; thereby, X-carrier does not exit the boundaries of the CFSTR to which they are assigned or exchange boundaries with other CFSTRs in the series.

40|$|A hybrid {{activated}} sludge/biofilm process (IFAS) was investigated.

This process is suitable for upgrading existing activated sludge wastewater treatment plants which are {{no longer able to}} comply with the effluent standards, and in particular in those cases where the existing plant does not nitrify or only nitrify during summer. However, the IFAS processes are relatively new and there are still uncertainties with respect to their design. A main task is to find a rational approach to the design of nitrification in hybrid reactors. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to gain insight the nitrification process in a hybrid reactor and, in particular, to establish the influence of mixed liquor SRT.

In the field of fermentation industry, they are ideal hosts for secondary metabolites and recombinant protein production. At the industrial-scale, equipments usually required for solid-state or submerged fermentation of filamentous fungi have demonstrated their limitations in terms of productivity, mass transfers or products recovery (1, 2). Recently, fungal <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> were designed to combine advantages from submerged and solid-state culture and reveal their usefulness for greater secondary metabolites production relative to submerged culture conditions (3).

40|$|Thesis summary In {{the last}} decade, {{numerous}} single-species <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> of various configurations {{have been implemented}} at lab and pilot scale {{for the production of}} chemicals and biological products. Compared to their counterparts in submerged cultures, these processes benefit from the specific physiology of biofilms, i. e. high robustness of the microbial system, long-term activity, continuous implementation and low ratio size / productivity. However, the risks of biofouling and the lack of analytical tools for the control and the monitoring of biofilms are obstacles for scale-up strategies. Up to now, single-species <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> have been mainly confined to the production of metabolites ranging from low (bulk chemicals) to medium (fine chemicals) added values. In this way, {{there is a need to}} design efficient single-species <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> exhibiting good scalability potentials and intended for the production of high added value compounds. In this work, an experimental single-species <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> has been designed for the production of target molecules derived from metabolic pathways involved in biofilm physiology. On the basis of these criteria, three biological models having good abilities of biofilm formation and secretion performances were selected : -	the gram positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis for the production of surfactin, a surface active metabolite involved in biofilm formation. -	the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei for the production of hydrophobin (HFBII), a surface active protein (7 kDa) involved in adhesion process of spores and mycelium on solid surface. -	the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryaze (engineered strain) for the production of a recombinant protein (Gla::GFP) under the control of the glaB promoter specifically activated in solid-state fermentation. The proposed experimental <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> has the configuration of a trickle-bed bioreactor. The agitation axis of a stirred tank reactor has been removed and replaced by a stainless steel structured packing filling the top of the vessel. The liquid medium, located in the bottom of the vessel is continuously recirculated on the packing element thanks to a peristaltic pump. An ascending air flow is performed above the liquid phase just under the packing element. This thesis reports the screening of the three biological models in the experimental <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor.</b> The results include the characterization of process performances in terms of biofilm formation and secretion of the target molecule under different operating conditions. An original methodology based on high energy X-ray tomography has been developed to non-invasively visualize and quantify the biofilm colonization inside the packing element. This technique has highlighted that biofilm colonization and liquid phase distribution across the packing are strongly interrelated phenomena. The biofilm of B. subtilis occurring by cell aggregation preferentially developed on solid areas wetted by the liquid. Accordingly, optimal operating conditions improving liquid phase distribution have been defined for biofilm colonization. The fungal biofilm of A. oryzae and T. reesei occuring by cell filamentation equally colonize submerged and aerial surfaces of the packing element. Consequently, another configuration of <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> comprising a packing element totally immersed in the liquid medium has been investigated. The production yields of surfactin and hydrophobin in the experimental <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> are respectively 1. 25 and 2. 64 times greater than those of a submerged culture in a stirred tank reactor. This suggests that surface-active molecules involved in biofilm formation have a real interest for the design of single-species <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors.</b> Although the Gla::GFP fusion protein is greater produced in the stirred tank culture, its integrity was preserved in the <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> despite the presence of proteases. This suggests that the quality and the stability of heterologous proteins produced in a fungal <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> are improved compared with a submerged culture. Finally, the implementation of the <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> has led to technological progresses including low energy consumption, no foam formation, continuous processing and simplification of downstream process operations. Further experiments should deepen the understanding of structured phenotypic heterogeneity impact on secretion performances in the <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor.</b> These experiments should consider development of operating conditions allowing for the growth of a thin biofilm homogeneously distributed on the whole surface provided by the packing element in order to optimize nutrients and metabolites mass transfers. The scale-up and the continuous implementation of the process should be also investigated...|$|R

Although <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> always contain an amount of suspended biomass, this biomass is mostly neglected in mathematical models of <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors.</b> This thesis is based on four papers which investigate the role of suspended biomass in <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors.</b> A one-dimensional mathematical model of biofilm and suspended biomass in a continuous stirred tank reac-tor is presented and analyzed in the first paper. The underlying model is a hybrid model of chemostat-like mass balances for the substrate and biomass in the reactor, coupled with a free boundary value problem for the substrate in the biofilm. In a single species single substrate setting, stability conditions for washout and persistence are given. It is found that biofilm and suspended biomass are either both present in the reactor or completel...|$|R
40|$|Abstract AQUASIM is a {{computer}} program for the identification and simulation of aquatic systems. The program includes a one-dimensional multisubstrate and multispecies biofilm model and represents a suitable tool for biofilm simulation. The program {{can be used to}} calculate substrate removal in <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> for any user specified microbial system. One-dimensional spatial profiles of substrates and microbial species in the biofilm can be predicted. The program also calculates the development of the biofilm thickness and of the substrates and microbial species in the biofilm and in the bulk fluid over time. Detachment and attachment of microbial cells at the biofilm surface and in the biofilm interior can be considered, and simulations of sloughing events can be performed. Furthermore, AQUASIM allows pseudo two-dimensional modeling of plug flow <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> by a series of <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> compartments. The most significant limitation of the model is that it only considers spatial gradients of substrates and microbial species in the biofilm in the direction perpendicular to the substratum.

40|$|Abstract：PCBs removal in {{the aged}} {{leachate}} {{by a new}} combination process based on an innovative <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> with natural fiber media, combined coagulation with a two-staged sequencing batch <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> with Luffa Sponges (LS) as the biomass carriers (LS-SBBR), was studied in this paper. The {{results indicated that the}} total PCBs removal in the aged leachate was 51. 97 %, and the PCBs removals are mainly achieved by the removal of trichlorobiphenyls, the PCBs contents in sludge in the two-staged LS-SBBR were consistent with the conclusion that the PCBs removal in liquid phase of the second LS-SBBR was higher than that of the first LS-SBBR...|$|R
40|$|The study {{concerns}} surfactin and/or fengycin {{batch production}} by immobilized cells of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332. Light carriers {{designed for a}} three phase inverse fluidized bed <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> (TPFIBR) were used. With respect to the <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> development, a new support based on iron grafting onto polypropylene foams has been proposed. A suspension solid-state grafting process was applied to graft ferric acetylacetonate onto polypropylene (PP) foams with a density of 0. 3 – 0. 7 g/cm 3. The iron contents grafted onto PP increased with the reaction time and then it tended to level off. The iron contents at 7. 5 and 10 h are 0. 74 and 0. 75 wt...|$|R

All the available methods for treatment of {{pulp and paper}} mill effluent have certain drawbacks. In this work, experiments were conducted to treat the pulp and paper mill effluent using moving bed <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> (MBBR). The wastewater generated by these industries contains high COD, BOD, colour, organic substances and toxic chemicals. This study was carried out on laboratory scale Moving Bed <b>Biofilm</b> <b>Reactor</b> with proflex type biocarriers, where the biofilm grows on small, free floating plastic elements with a large surface area and a density slightly less than 1. 0 g/cm 3.
