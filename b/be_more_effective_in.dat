5|$|There are controlled-release {{versions}} of levodopa. Older controlled-release levodopa preparations have poor and unreliable absorption and bioavailability {{and have not}} demonstrated improved control of PD motor symptoms or a reduction in levodopa-related complications when compared to immediate release preparations. A newer extended-release levodopa preparation does seem to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> reducing fluctuations but in many patients problems persist. Intestinal infusions of levodopa (Duodopa) can result in striking improvements in fluctuations compared to oral levodopa when the fluctuations are due to insufficient uptake caused by gastroparesis. Other oral, longer acting formulations are under study and other modes of delivery (inhaled, transdermal) are being developed.|$|E

5|$|In late 1964 the RAN {{sought the}} Government's {{approval}} to upgrade Melbourne and purchase {{a force of}} 18 Skyhawks and 16 Trackers. The Skyhawks were intended {{to be used to}} provide air defence for the fleet as well as to attack warships and targets on land. While the Naval Board saw maritime strike as being a logical task for the FAA, the RAAF argued that the 24 General Dynamics F-111C aircraft it had ordered would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> this role. Cabinet agreed to the proposal to modernise the carrier and acquire Trackers in November 1964, but delayed a decision on the Skyhawks at that time. Following further lobbying and staff work by the Navy, the Government eventually agreed to purchase ten Skyhawks in early 1965 for a cost of £9.2 million. This order comprised eight single-seat fighter aircraft and a pair of two-seat TA-4 Skyhawk trainers. These aircraft were the first newly built Skyhawks to be sold to a country other than the United States.|$|E
5|$|Alongside her singing, Malouma {{has also}} fought to {{safeguard}} her country's music, urging {{the government to}} create a music school, forming her own foundation in support of musical heritage, and in 2014 creating her own music festival. She has also been active in politics since the 1990s, {{when she began to}} campaign for more democracy. She was elected a senator in 2007, the first politician in her caste, but was arrested the following year after a coup d'état. When elections were again held in 2009, she became a senator for the opposition Ech-Choura party where she was given special responsibilities for the environment. This led in 2011 to her appointment as the IUCN's Goodwill Ambassador for Central and West Africa. In December 2014, she announced she was moving from the opposition to join the ruling party, the Union for the Republic, where she felt she could <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> contributing to the country's progress. Her work has been recognized by the French, who decorated her as a Knight of the Legion of Honor, and the Americans, whose ambassador to Mauritania named her a Mauritanian Woman of Courage.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August, Göring {{read the}} {{reports on the}} losses of 18 August, and unhappy with {{the extent of the}} losses, {{recalled}} both pilots. Hitler's Directive 17 had ordered the Luftwaffe to achieve air superiority, but remain strong enough for when, or rather if, Sea Lion was launched. Moreover, Göring recognised that the Luftwaffe was his power base. A failure would be damaging, but a severe weakening of the Luftwaffe would be far worse. He emphasised to his commanders the need to preserve the Luftwaffe's strength. Essentially, the core theme of the conference was fighter protection. The fighter leaders advocated sweeps to clear the skies in advance of attacks. Other commanders present thought a combination of sweeps and close escort would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> reducing losses. Göring agreed and listed a number of forms that the sweeps could take. The most important tactical change he made was instituting a wholesale purge of older Geschwaderkommodore in favour of younger men. From now on, leaders were to be drawn from the ranks, given responsibility based on skill and experience rather than rank, while allowing them to have a free rein in tactical engagements (a form of aerial Auftragstaktik).|$|E

For example, a hind leg of a grasshopper is still about 12.4 times the size of a single ant and a great resource in itself.|$|E
