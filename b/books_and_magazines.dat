25|$|Concerned {{that the}} sale of items such as bongs and rolling papers, along with <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>magazines</b> devoted to the era's drug culture {{promoted}} and encouraged illegal recreational drug use, {{the board of trustees}} of the village of Hoffman Estates, Illinois, passed an ordinance requiring that vendors of drug paraphernalia obtain a license to do so, as they lacked the power to ban their sale outright. As a condition of that license, they were required to keep a record of the name and address of anyone buying such items for inspection by the police at any time. One of the two stores it applied to, The Flipside, filed suit in federal court for the Northern District of Illinois, seeking to have the ordinance invalidated, claiming its scope was so wide and overbroad as to possibly prevent the store from selling the <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>magazines,</b> thus infringing its First Amendment rights.|$|E

Due to cross-readership, consumer response is not limited by demographics. For example, male readers may subscribe to a series intended for female readers, and so on.

25|$|Erosion : Hill-walking and use {{of other}} public {{rights-of-way}} is an extremely popular use of all the national parks.

Examples include Dovedale in the Peak District. Over-grazing, for example, by sheep on hill and moorland areas, can also reduce vegetation, leading to increased erosion.|$|E
