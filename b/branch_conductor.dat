40|$|In this paper, {{an attempt}} {{has been made}} to develop a new {{algorithm}} for distribution system planning. The proposed algorithm does not require prior knowledge of candidate substation location and can automatically select location of a substation, the optimal feeder configuration and the optimal sizes of branch conductors while satisfying constraints such as current capacity, voltage drop and heuristic rules. Several algorithms are proposed for distribution systems planning. A generalized algorithm is developed for obtaining the optimal feeder path and the optimal location of substation on minimum loss criterion. Heuristic rules are incorporated in the above algorithm. Another algorithm is for <b>branch</b> <b>conductor</b> optimizations. Modified load flow method is also presented in the paper, which can handle composite load models. The load flow algorithm is used for solving radial distribution networks (RDN) and <b>branch</b> <b>conductor</b> optimization algorithm. The load flow algorithm and <b>branch</b> <b>conductor</b> optimization techniques are used as subroutine in the generalized distribution systems planning algorithm. Through numerical example the validity of proposed method is verified. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Selecting {{the optimum}} {{type and size}} of {{conductors}} for planning and optimization of distribution networks {{is an essential part}} of the design process. In this paper, a new and efficient algorithm to the optimal selection of conductors of feeder sections of radial distribution networks is proposed. In optimization procedure, cost of conducting material, cost of energy losses, bus voltage profile and current carrying capacity of conductors are considered. The availability of an adequate amount of electricity and its utilization is essential for the growth and development of the country. Development of distribution systems result in higher system losses and poor voltage regulation. This paper presents optimal <b>branch</b> <b>conductor</b> selection of radial distribution systems using intelligent methods for based of CSA and compared with algorithm PSO to minimize the overall cost of annual energy losses and unavailability of conductors in order to improve productivity.

40|$|International audienceThe {{conductance}} {{through a}} <b>branched</b> <b>conductor</b> placed between two electrodes is analyzed using the Landauer transport formulation {{within the framework}} of the single electron, and the tight binding approximations. Terminal side chains are expressed as self energy terms which map the <b>branched</b> <b>conductor</b> onto an effective linear chain Hamiltonian. The effect of uniform side branches on resonant zero-bias conductance is shown to be analytically solvable and particularly simple, where subtraction or addition of a single terminal site can induce an effective discontinuity in the main linear chain or can effectively decouple the side <b>branch</b> from the <b>conductor.</b> Manipulating the "effective length" of a side branch by a local terminal gate potential, control of the small bias current through the <b>branched</b> <b>conductor</b> is demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|The {{adoption}} of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) {{as a means}} of transportation over conventionally fueled vehicles introduces new challenges to the existing infrastructure of the electrical transmission and distribution system. PHEV battery charging can represent a significant power demand that has the potential to overload electrical distribution components. This study examines the impacts of PHEV charging on household service transformers, distribution conductors and voltage levels of a Central California residential distribution system. The system is simulated using ETAP power system analysis software. Transformers are the most vulnerable to overloads, especially if PHEV charging occurs in clusters. Main feeder conductors will be overloaded if a large amount of high power, quick charging occurs. <b>Branch</b> <b>conductors</b> will not be affected by PHEV charging. Based on current PHEV market projections for the region this study shows that significant equipment overloads are not likely to occur until well after 2017...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Downed <b>conductors,</b> tree <b>branches</b> {{touching}} <b>conductors,</b> {{and failing}} insulators often cause high-impedance faults in overhead distribution systems. The fault currents of these faults are {{much smaller than}} detection thresholds of traditional ground fault detection devices, so reliable detection of these highimpedance faults is challenging. Although fault currents can be much smaller in ungrounded systems than fault currents in multigrounded systems given similar fault conditions, fault detection for ungrounded systems is nevertheless easier. This paper contrasts the differences between high-impedance fault detections for ungrounded and multigrounded systems. The paper explains fault detection of ungrounded distribution systems {{and the issue of}} fault detection sensitivity. The paper also introduces a recent advance in faulted phase selection on these ungrounded systems and demonstrates this advance through a staged fault test example from a utility. I...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} {{field and}} circuit approach in time domain {{is presented in}} this paper for the realistic study of power frequency devices. The field analysis is performed by an explicit, conditionally stable, finite difference scheme that allows the whole procedure to take place in time domain avoiding large, sparse matrix inversions, a significant shortcoming of implicit methods. The circuit equations are also considered in time and are easily coupled to the field analysis technique via <b>branch</b> currents and <b>conductor</b> voltage drops.

Two thermodynamic property programs (GASP/WASP and GASPAK) provide required thermodynamic and thermophysical properties for 36 fluids: helium, methane, neon, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, fluorine, hydrogen, parahydrogen, water, kerosene (RP- 1), isobutene, butane, deuterium, ethane, ethylene, hydrogen sulfide, krypton, propane, xenon, R- 11, R- 12, R- 22, R- 32, R- 123, R- 124, R- 125, R- 134 A, R- 152 A, nitrogen trifluoride, ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, and air. The program also provides the options of using any incompressible fluid with constant density and viscosity or ideal gas. The users can also supply property tables for fluids {{that are not in}} the library. Twenty-four different resistance/source options are provided for modeling momentum sources or sinks in the branches. These options include pipe flow, flow through a restriction, noncircular duct, pipe flow with entrance and/or exit losses, thin sharp orifice, thick orifice, square edge reduction, square edge expansion, rotating annular duct, rotating radial duct, labyrinth seal, parallel plates, common fittings and valves, pump characteristics, pump power, valve with a given loss coefficient, Joule-Thompson device, control valve, heat exchanger core, parallel tube, and compressible orifice. The program has the provision of including additional resistance options through User Subroutines. GFSSP employs a finite volume formulation of mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations in conjunction with the thermodynamic equations of state for real fluids as well as energy conservation equations for the solid. The system of equations describing the fluid network is solved by a hybrid numerical method that is a combination of the Newton-Raphson and successive substitution methods.

40|$|Safety and {{reliability}} {{are two of}} the most important aspects of electric power supply systems. Sensitivity and robustness to detect and isolate faults can influence the safety {{and reliability}} of such systems. Overcurrent relays are generally used to protect the high voltage feeders in distribution systems. Downed <b>conductors,</b> tree <b>branches</b> touching <b>conductors,</b> and failing insulators often cause high-impedance faults in overhead distribution systems. The levels of currents of these faults are often much smaller than detection thresholds of traditional ground fault detection devices, thus reliable detection of these high impedance faults is a real challenge. With modern signal processing techniques, special hardware and software can be used to significantly improve the reliability of detection of certain types of faults. This paper presents a new method for detecting High Impedance Faults (HIF) in distribution systems using real coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) to analyse the harmonics and phase angles of the fault current signals. The method is used to discriminate HIFs by identifying specific events that happen when a HIF occurs.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new theory}} of multiparty session types based on symmetric sum types, by which we can type non-deterministic orchestration choice behaviours. While the original branching type in session types can represent a choice made by a single participant and accepted by others determining how the session proceeds, the symmetric sum type represents a choice made by agreement among all the participants of a session. Such behaviour {{can be found in}} many practical systems, including collaborative workflow in healthcare systems for clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Processes using the symmetric sums can be embedded into the original <b>branching</b> types using <b>conductor</b> processes. We show that this type-driven embedding preserves typability, satisfies semantic soundness and completeness, and meets the encodability criteria adapted to the typed setting. The theory leads to an efficient implementation of a prototypical tool for CPGs which automatically translates the original CPG specifications from a representation called the Process Matrix to symmetric sum types, type checks programs and executes them.
