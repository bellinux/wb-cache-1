5|$|The Cattle Dog breed {{standard}} {{states that it}} should have well-conditioned muscles, even when bred for companion or show purposes, and that its appearance should be symmetrical and <b>balanced,</b> <b>with</b> no individual part of the dog exaggerated. It should not look either delicate or cumbersome, as either characteristic limits the agility and endurance that is necessary for a working dog.|$|E
5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be <b>balanced,</b> <b>with</b> or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} part, titled Payback, Atwood {{examines}} ecological debt. She recounts {{the journey of}} Scrooge in A Christmas Carol but placed in a modern setting. The modern-day Scrooge is visited by the spirits of Earth Day. In the past Scrooge witnesses debts to nature being repaid through animal and human sacrifices and through pestilence in over-crowded or unsustainable populations. In the present Scrooge witnesses current unsustainable practices, over-fishing and deforestation, creating a debt to nature being repaid through effects on the climate and impacts on people. Finally, in the future, Scrooge is shown two versions: one, an eco-friendly human society <b>balanced</b> <b>with</b> environmental systems, and the other, a dystopian future with a disaster affecting the fuel or food resources {{in such a way}} that hyperinflation sets in and renders money useless.|$|E

50|$|Traditional Chinese Veterinary MedicineTraditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine (TCVM) is {{the ancient}} {{veterinary}} {{treatment of animals}} developed {{over a period of}} over 3,500 years and is practiced all over the world. TCVM has rapidly grown as an adjunct therapeutic modality for animals. Chinese philosophical truths based on Taoism are the underpinnings that influence the practice of TCVM. The fundamental truth for health in TCVM is balance—balance within yourself, <b>balance</b> <b>with</b> others, <b>balance</b> <b>with</b> your diet, and <b>balance</b> <b>with</b> nature. TCVM practices include four major fundamental branches: food therapy, acupuncture, herbal therapy, and Tui-Na ("twee-na").|$|R
5|$|The {{years from}} 1949 to 1953 are often {{considered}} {{the highlight of}} Vandersteen's career, when he combined large production with consistent high quality in his stories, the jokes, the many characters, and the graphical aspects, in which the charming quirkiness of the early years was <b>balanced</b> <b>with</b> the more rigorous ligne claire of Hergé. Many of these stories were loosely based on popular classics, ranging from Alexandre Dumas over Buffalo Bill to Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, with as culmination his comic in {{two parts of the}} legend of Till Eulenspiegel, made for Kuifje.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of the H-41 design, Hitler issued a request for a larger battleship and placed no restrictions on gun caliber or displacement. The only requirements were a speed of , horizontal and underwater protection sufficiently strong enough to protect the vessel from all attacks, and a main battery properly <b>balanced</b> <b>with</b> the size of the ship. The results were purely study projects intended to determine the size of a ship with strong enough armor to counter the rapidly increasing power of bombs deployed by the Allies during the war. The Commission did not discuss its activities with Raeder or his successor, Admiral Karl Dönitz, or with other branches in the OKM. As the designs for the H-42, H-43, and H-44 battleships were purely conjectural, no actual work was begun. The German navy did not seriously consider construction on any of the designs, which were so large that they could not have been built in a traditional slipway. Indeed, the Construction Office of the OKM sought to disassociate itself from the projects, which they found to be of doubtful merit and unnecessary for German victory.|$|E
5|$|During Harper's tenure, Canada had {{budgetary}} surpluses from 2006 to 2008 of $13.8 and 9.6 billion respectively. Following the 2008 financial crisis, Canada ran deficits from 2009-2013. The {{deficit was}} $55.6 billion in 2009 and was gradually lowered to $5.2 billion in 2013. In 2014, {{the federal budget}} was <b>balanced</b> <b>with</b> a surplus of $1.9 billion. For the first 11 months of 2015, {{the federal government was}} on track for a $7.5 billion surplus. Following the 2015 federal election and a change in government, the 2015 fiscal year ended in a $1 billion deficit instead. In 2010, Canada had the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7 economies. The Economist magazine stated that Canada had come out the recession stronger than any other rich country in the G7. In 2013, Canada came out with Global Markets Action Plan to generate employment opportunities for Canadians.|$|E

5|$|In June 1940, the Government of Madras {{appointed}} a committee headed by Srinivasa Sastri to frame {{a set of}} general principles for coining words for scientific and technical terms in vernacular languages. The constitution of the committee was strongly condemned by the Madras Presidency Tamil Sangam and its Secretary E. M. Subramania Pillai who felt that Srinivasa Sastri was biased in favour of Sanskrit and hence, Anti-Tamil. The committee submitted its report after three months recommending the retention of the existing Sanskrit loanwords in Tamil and rejecting the need {{for them to be}} replaced. The deliberations of the Sastri Committee provoked widespread agitations in Madras Presidency. The committee was eventually reshuffled by Provincial Education Minister T. S. Avinashilingam Chettiar soon after the demise of Srinivasa Sastri and <b>balanced</b> <b>with</b> the introduction of more members supporting the replacement of Sanskrit loan words.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be <b>balanced</b> <b>with</b> vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with the flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E
