5|$|In February 2015, {{a credit}} dispute between {{universal}} primer technology and DNA barcoding came to light. Verma {{has argued that}} DNA barcoding, a technique independently described by zoologist Paul D N Hebert in 2003, {{is essentially the same}} as universal primer technology (UPT) and that both utilize standardized, short stretch of DNA from mitochondrial genome, amplified using the specific universal primers, to assign the identity of an unknown <b>biological</b> <b>sample</b> to a particular species. Verma claimed that UPT was described earlier than DNA barcoding in his patents, and publication; therefore, it should be fairly credited. However, Hebert argued that he was not aware of UPT because its patents were not visible to the broader scientific community due to a substantial interval from its filing in 2001 to grant in 2006.|$|E

25|$|Nd:YAG lasers are {{frequently}} {{used to build}} optical tweezers for biological applications.

25|$|Knowledge of {{the origin}} of a sample can provide insight into the {{component}} molecules of the sample and their fragmentations. A sample from a synthesis/manufacturing process will probably contain impurities chemically related to the target component.

25|$|Nano-FTIR {{does not}} require special sample {{preparation}} and is typically performed under ambient conditions. It uses an AFM operated in noncontact mode that is intrinsically nondestructive and sufficiently gentle to be suitable for soft-matter and <b>biological</b> <b>sample</b> investigations. Nano-FTIR can be utilized from THz to visible spectral range(and not only in infrared as its name suggests) depending on the application requirements and availability of broadband sources. Nano-FTIR is complementary to Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), SNOM, AFM-IR and other scanning probe methods {{that are capable of}} performing vibrational analysis.|$|E
25|$|ESI has a {{more complex}} {{ionisation}} mechanism, relying heavily on droplet charge excess and as such {{there are many more}} factors to consider when exploring the cause of ion suppression. It has been widely observed that for many analytes, at high concentrations, ESI exhibits a loss of detector response linearity, perhaps due to reduced charge excess caused by analyte saturation at the droplet surface, inhibiting subsequent ejection of gas phase ions from further inside the droplet. Thus competition for space and/or charge may be considered as a source of ion suppression in ESI. Both physical and chemical properties of analytes (e.g. basicity and surface activity) determine their inherent ionisation efficiency. <b>Biological</b> <b>sample</b> matrices naturally tend to contain many endogenous species with high basicity and surface activity, hence the total concentration of these species in the sample will quickly reach levels at which ion suppression should be expected.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} archive <b>biological</b> <b>samples</b> for {{subsequent}} nucleic acid analysis {{is essential for}} tissue specimens and forensic samples. FTA ® Card is a chemically treated filter paper designed for the collec-tion and room temperature storage of <b>biological</b> <b>samples</b> for subse-quent DNA analysis. Its usefulness {{for the preservation of}} <b>biological</b> <b>samples</b> for subsequent RNA analysis was tested. Here, we demon-strate that RNA in <b>biological</b> <b>samples</b> stored on FTA Cards is stable and can be used successfully for RT-PCR and northern blot analysis. RNA stability depends on the storage temperature and the type of bio-logical specimen. RNA in mammalian cells stored on FTA Cards is stable for over one year at temperatures at or below- 20 °C and for two to three months in samples stored at room temperature. For plant leaf, longer storage times (> 5 days) require temperatures at or below- 70 °C following sample application. FTA Cards may constitute a method not only for convenient collection and storage of <b>biological</b> <b>samples</b> but also for rapid RT-PCR analysis of tissue and cell samples...|$|R

25|$|Materials {{that have}} {{dimensions}} {{small enough to}} be electron transparent, such as powdered substances, small organisms, viruses, or nanotubes, can be quickly prepared by the deposition of a dilute sample containing the specimen onto films on support grids. Biological specimens may be embedded in resin to withstand the high vacuum in the sample chamber and to enable cutting tissue into electron transparent thin sections. The <b>biological</b> <b>sample</b> can be stained using either a negative staining material such as uranyl acetate for bacteria and viruses, or, {{in the case of}} embedded sections, the specimen may be stained with heavy metals, including osmium tetroxide. Alternately samples may be held at liquid nitrogen temperatures after embedding in vitreous ice. In material science and metallurgy the specimens can usually withstand the high vacuum, but still must be prepared as a thin foil, or etched so some portion of the specimen is thin enough for the beam to penetrate. Constraints on the thickness of the material may be limited by the scattering cross-section of the atoms from which the material is comprised.|$|E
