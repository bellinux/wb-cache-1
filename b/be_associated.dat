40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the financial crises in Argentina and Turkey {{in order to}} find out whether a set of six major macroeconomic indicators account for these crises or not. Evidence suggests that in Turkey, an increase in domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with the 1992, 1994 and 2001 financial crises, whereas an increase in CPI <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with all crisis episodes. Similarly, a decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with all crises. A fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with financial crises in 1991, 1992 and 1994. An increase in M 1 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> only with the crisis in 1992 and a fall in the volume of exports relative to volume of imports <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with the crisis in 1994. In Argentina, an increase in neither CPI nor domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with any of the financial crises. A decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with all crises, whereas a fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with financial crises in 1991 and 2000.
