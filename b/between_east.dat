5|$|Alexander's legacy {{extended}} beyond his military conquests. His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade <b>between</b> <b>East</b> and West, and vast areas {{to the east}} were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves {{got a sense of}} belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Another {{portion of}} modern VT 14, <b>between</b> <b>East</b> Brookfield and Williamstown center, {{was to be}} {{improved}} by another turnpike corporation, the Williamstown Center Turnpike, which was chartered on November 14, 1803. The charter provided that the road {{be turned over to}} the state after having been in operation for 25 years (later amended to 40 years). The company, however, did not do anything in its first two years of existence and only began laying out the road in 1805.|$|E

5|$|By the 7th century, England {{was almost}} entirely divided into kingdoms {{ruled by the}} Anglo-Saxons, {{who had come to}} Britain two hundred years earlier. The kingdom of Mercia {{occupied}} what is now the English Midlands. Neighbouring kingdoms included Northumbria to the north, East Anglia to the east, and Wessex, the kingdom of the West Saxons, to the south. Essex, the kingdom of the East Saxons, included London and lay <b>between</b> <b>East</b> Anglia and the kingdom of Kent. The earliest Mercian king for whom there is definite historical information is Penda of Mercia, Coenred's paternal grandfather.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{settlement}} recognising {{his claim to}} Morley's music patent, Barley seemingly {{found it difficult to}} enforce his rights, even with his new role as a stationer. Less than half of the known music books published from 1606 to 1613 recognised Barley's rights on the imprint. Barley took Thomas Adams to the Stationers' court in 1609, challenging the copyrights of the music books Adams had published. The court handed down a settlement similar to the one <b>between</b> <b>East</b> and Barley. However, none of the music books Adams published afterward contained any recognition of Barley's patent.|$|E

5|$|NY292 was {{originally}} part of NY39 in the 1920s, which ran from Patterson to Poughkeepsie via West Patterson and East Fishkill. In the 1930 renumbering, {{the portion of}} NY39 <b>between</b> <b>East</b> Fishkill and the western fringe of Patterson was redesignated {{as part of the}} new NY52. Between Patterson and NY22, old NY39 was renumbered to NY311.|$|E
5|$|The NY35 {{designation}} {{remained in}} place until the early 1940s when it was split into two designations: NY383 west of Walworth and NY350 from Walworth to Ontario. As part of the change, NY35B was renumbered to NY383B. NY383 itself was altered on January1, 1949, to end in downtown Rochester. The former routing of NY383 <b>between</b> <b>East</b> Avenue (NY96) in Rochester and NY350 in Walworth became NY286 while NY383B was redesignated as NY286A.|$|E

5|$|The Pakistani {{government}} was severely criticised for its {{handling of the}} relief operations following the storm, both by local political leaders in East Pakistan and in the international media. In the December national elections, the opposition Awami League gained a landslide victory, gaining 160 of the 162 East Pakistani seats. Continuing unrest <b>between</b> <b>East</b> Pakistanis and the central government trigged the Bangladesh Liberation War, which concluded {{with the creation of}} the state of Bangladesh.

5|$|To {{maintain}} control and improve administration, various schemes {{to divide the}} work of the Roman Emperor by sharing it between individuals were tried between 285 and 324, from 337 to 350, from 364 to 392, and again between 395 and 480. Although the administrative subdivisions varied, they generally involved a division of labour <b>between</b> <b>East</b> and West. Each division was a form of power-sharing (or even job-sharing), for the ultimate imperium was not divisible and therefore the empire remained legally one state—although the co-emperors often saw each other as rivals or enemies.|$|E

5|$|An ancient {{division}} <b>between</b> <b>east</b> {{and west}} Wessex {{continued to be}} important in the 9th century; the boundary was Selwood Forest on the borders of Somerset, Dorset and Wiltshire. The two bishoprics of Wessex were Selborne in the west and Winchester in the east. Æthelwulf's family connections seem to have been west of Selwood, but his patronage was concentrated further east, particularly on Winchester, where his father was buried, and where he appointed Swithun to succeed Helmstan as bishop in 852–853. However, he made a grant of land in Somerset to his leading ealdorman, Eanwulf, and on 26 December 846 he granted a large estate to himself in South Hams in west Devon. He thus changed it from royal demesne, which he was obliged to pass on to his successor as king, to bookland, which could be transferred as the owner pleased, so he could make land grants to followers to improve security in a frontier zone.|$|E
