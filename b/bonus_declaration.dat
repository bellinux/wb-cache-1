40|$|Summary. New {{regulations}} and stronger competitions {{have increased the}} demand for stochastic asset-liability management (ALM) models for insurance companies in recent years. In this article, we propose a discrete time ALM model for the simulation of simplified balance sheets of life insurance products. The model incorporates the most important life insurance product characteristics, the surrender of contracts, a reserve-dependent <b>bonus</b> <b>declaration,</b> a dynamic asset allocation and a two-factor stochastic capital market. All terms arising in the model can be calculated recursively which allows an easy implementation and efficient evaluation of the model equations. The modular design of the model permits straightforward modifications and extensions to handle specific requirements. In practise, the simulation of stochastic ALM models is usually performed by Monte Carlo methods which suffer from relatively low convergence rates and often very long run times, though. As alternatives to Monte Carlo simulation, we here propose deterministic integration schemes, such as quasi-Monte Carlo and sparse grid methods for the numerical simulation of such models. Their efficiency is demonstrated by numerical examples which show that the deterministic methods often perform much better than Monte Carlo simulation {{as well as by}} theoretical considerations which show that ALM problems are often of low effective dimension. ...|$|E

50|$|Following {{the success}} of the Superstars and Cannonballs video album, the album was reissued in November 2000, {{containing}} a <b>bonus</b> live album, <b>Declaration,</b> featuring recordings from the concert at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre on 21 May 2000. Including sales of the re-issue, the album has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide, being certified platinum in a number of countries. It became the band's last studio album after Daniel decided to leave in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|The New Order {{recorded}} demos {{twice in}} Los Angeles: First in 1975 with Jeff Spry as lead singer {{and then in}} 1976 with Dave Gilbert as lead singer. Both recordings were later released with a production by Neil Merryweather in 1977 as a single album [...] "The New Order", on the Fun Records/Isadora label and distributed by RCA Records. The album's lo-fi quality {{was the result of}} it being produced from Ron Asheton's inferior cassette copies, instead of the original master tapes. The album was later reissued with different cover art and a <b>bonus</b> track as <b>Declaration</b> Of War in 1987. Declaration Of War was reissued again in 1991, this time on CD.|$|R
