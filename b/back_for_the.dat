5|$|Early script drafts had Henry accidentally kill Louise Mortimer, but {{producers}} {{were never}} satisfied with this development, thinking Henry would have failed if she died. Writers also posited that Henry's father's murder involved revenge {{after he had}} an affair, but the producers and Gatiss {{found it easier to}} mention he died because he learned of Franklin's experiments with the hallucinogenic gas.

5|$|At {{the first}} round of pit stops, Hamilton had a lead of nearly 20seconds over Massa, and fuelled longer than all the other drivers in the points-scoring {{positions}} when he pitted on lap18. Coming out of the pits, Hamilton made an error and was passed by Trulli.

Trulli's teammate Glock stayed out on the track longer than all of the other drivers except Barrichello and Piquet, meaning that when he pitted, he was actually in third position and rejoined the race in eighth. Hamilton regained the lead by lap22 after Massa, Kovalainen, Trulli and Räikkönen made their pit stops, and had in the region of an 11second lead over Massa at the half-way stage of the race. Behind the leaders, fourth-placed Kubica was beginning to catch Kovalainen in third, while Trulli, Räikkönen, Alonso and Vettel battled over the final four point-scoring places.|$|E

5|$|Enraged by this, and by {{accusations of}} fraudulently passing off foreign moths as British, Cribb gave up {{collecting}} {{and left the}} rest of the specimens with his landlady as security for a debt. Here the stories from Manchester University and The Australian Museum, Victoria differ as to whether it was Cribb's pub landlady or the landlady of his lodgings, but either way the result was the same. The debt was not paid on time and when Cribb went <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> moths, which he had already sold to another collector, his landlady had burnt them. Subsequent efforts by other collectors to find more of the moths were unsuccessful, and the three specimens left in existence are thought to be the only representatives of an extinct species.|$|E
5|$|Following Mikan's {{retirement}} in the 1954 off-season, the Lakers struggled but {{still managed to}} win 40 games.

Led by Lovellette's 20.6 points and 13.5 rebounds, they advanced to the Conference Finals in 1956–57.

They had hired Mikan, who had been the team's general manager for the previous two seasons, as head coach to replace Kundla.
