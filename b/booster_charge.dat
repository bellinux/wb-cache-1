25|$|It was {{immediately}} {{apparent that the}} explosions {{were the result of}} an attempted terrorist attack, but it was initially unclear whether the explosions were a serious attempt to repeat 7 July bombings or were merely a symbolic attack or hoax intended to cause panic rather than mass casualties. The explosives used by the bombers consisted of Chapatti flour powder mixed with liquid hydrogen peroxide, detonated by a <b>booster</b> <b>charge.</b> This was not the same explosive mixture used by the bombers in the 7/7 bombings two weeks earlier, which had used TATP. It was later confirmed that substantial improvised explosive devices capable of causing significant numbers of casualties had in fact been involved, but had failed to explode. The explosions were caused by detonators which failed to detonate the main explosive charge. Police later disclosed that some of the devices used had survived the explosions and were available for forensic investigation.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Navy {{continued}} filling armor-piercing shells with explosive D {{after some}} other nations had switched to TNT; but began filling naval mines, bombs, depth charges, and torpedo warheads with burster charges of crude grade B TNT with {{the color of}} brown sugar and requiring an explosive <b>booster</b> <b>charge</b> of granular crystallized grade A TNT for detonation. [...] High-explosive shells were filled with grade A TNT, which became preferred for other uses as industrial chemical capacity became available for removing xylene and similar hydrocarbons from the toluene feedstock and other nitrotoluene isomer byproducts from the nitrating reactions.|$|E

50|$|The {{principle}} {{is most often}} used for detonating insensitive explosive compounds by using stages of less and less sensitive explosive compounds. A simple example is the common industrial detonator, where a very small amount of a sensitive explosive detonates, causing the less sensitive main charge of the detonator to detonate. It may involve additional steps where successively less sensitive compounds trigger a detonation wave in each other, with stages including various types of <b>booster</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|R

50|$|At first, {{picric acid}} {{was used as}} a booster to {{detonate}} TNT, though it was superseded due to the inherent danger of picrate formation. Tetryl replaced picric acid because it is more stable, and was once a very popular chemical for <b>booster</b> <b>charges,</b> particularly during World War II. However, since then Tetryl has largely been replaced by other compositions, e.g. a small cylinder or pellet of phlegmatized RDX (e.g. CH-6 or Composition A-5) or PETN (slightly larger than the actual detonator) into which the detonator itself is inserted.|$|R
5000|$|Coastal Mariner {{was loaded}} with 4040 short tons of munitions at the Naval Weapons Station Earle. [...] The munitions {{included}} 512 tons of actual explosives.

The United States Coast Guard issued a notice to mariners and the United States Department of Fish and Wildlife and the United States Bureau of Commercial Fisheries sent observers. [...] The explosives detonated seventeen seconds after Coastal Mariner slipped below the surface on 14 July 1965.
