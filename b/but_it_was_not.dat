5|$|Bletchley {{had fought}} {{to be the}} centre of the {{proposed}} new city, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> to be. The 1971 Plan for Milton Keynes placed Central Milton Keynes on a completely new hill-top site four miles further north, half way to Wolverton. Bletchley was relegated to the status of suburb.|$|E

5|$|A metal-surfaced {{road from}} US 20 in Rushville to {{north of the}} Niobrara River was {{constructed}} between 1940 and 1948. It was extended south to north of Cravath Lake by 1953. The road {{was removed from the}} highway system map in 1957, and was re-added in 1960, as N-250. A narrow road was extended from N-250 to N-2 around 1981–82, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> part of N-250 until 1996. The routing has not changed significantly since.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} ants {{have been named}} after Clark. The holotype of Polyrhachis clarki was {{originally}} collected by Clark, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> described until 2013. There, {{the author of the}} article named the ant after him. Leptogenys clarki is another ant named after Clark for his contributions towards Australian ants, being described by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler in 1933. Ants he collected that bear his name include Dolichoderus clarki, Plagiolepis clarki and Stigmacros clarki.|$|E
5|$|Another {{educational}} work is De schematibus et tropis sacrae scripturae, which {{discusses the}} Bible's use of rhetoric. Bede {{was familiar with}} pagan authors such as Virgil, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> considered appropriate to teach biblical grammar from such texts, and in De schematibus... Bede argues for the superiority of Christian texts in understanding Christian literature. Similarly, his text on poetic metre uses only Christian poetry for examples.|$|E

5|$|Artillery, supplies, {{and troops}} were all being {{evacuated}} {{across the river}} at this time <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> going as fast as Washington had anticipated and daybreak soon came. A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that there {{did not seem to}} be any American pickets and thus began to search the area. While they were doing this, Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat. At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan. All 9,000 troops had been evacuated with no loss of life.|$|E
5|$|As for Casler's third {{possible}} explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> statistically significant. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{persistently}} programmed {{works that}} did not attract the public, Beecham's musical activities at this time consistently lost money. As {{a result of his}} estrangement from his father between 1899 and 1909, his access to the Beecham family fortune was strictly limited. From 1907 he had an annuity of £700 left to him in his grandfather's will, and his mother subsidised some of his loss-making concerts, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> until father and son were reconciled in 1909 that Beecham was able to draw on the family fortune to promote opera.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{effective}} anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} U.S. ships, plus evasive maneuvers, the bombs from the first nine Vals missed Enterprise. However, at 16:44, an armor-piercing, delayed-action bomb penetrated the flight deck near the aft elevator and passed through three decks before detonating below the waterline, killing 35 men and wounding 70 more. Incoming sea water caused Enterprise to develop a slight list, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a major breach of hull integrity.|$|E
5|$|Beer colour is {{determined}} by the malt. The most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts. Pale lager and pale ale are terms used for beers made from malt dried with the fuel coke. Coke was first used for roasting malt in 1642, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> until around 1703 that the term pale ale was used.|$|E
5|$|Calvin's first {{published}} work was a commentary of Seneca the Younger's De Clementia. Published {{at his own}} expense in 1532, it showed {{that he was a}} humanist in the tradition of Erasmus with a thorough understanding of classical scholarship. His first theological work, the Psychopannychia, attempted to refute the doctrine of soul sleep as promulgated by the Anabaptists. Calvin probably wrote it during the period following Cop's speech, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> published until 1542 in Strasbourg.|$|E

5|$|Coenwulf {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury {{over the issue of}} whether laypeople could control religious houses such as monasteries. The breakdown in {{the relationship between the two}} eventually reached the point where the archbishop was unable to exercise his duties for at least four years. A partial resolution was reached in 822 with Coenwulf's successor, King Ceolwulf, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> until about 826 that a final settlement was reached between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter, Cwoenthryth, who had been the main beneficiary of Coenwulf's grants of religious property.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th century, Dinefwr Castle {{was built}} by Lord Rhys. The castle and grounds were seized by Henry VIII in 1531, and the estate owners, who changed their family surname to Rice, {{subsequently}} had to buy back their property from the Crown. The family were elevated to the peerage of Great Britain as Baron Dynevor. Mary I is documented to have restored some of the land back to the Rhys family, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> until the reign of Charles I that the family fully regained their properties.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decades of the ACLU, Baldwin {{continued}} as its leader. His charisma and energy attracted many supporters to the ACLU board and leadership ranks. Baldwin was ascetic, wearing hand-me-down clothes, pinching pennies, and living on a very small salary. The ACLU was directed by an executive committee, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> particularly democratic or egalitarian. The ACLU's base in New York resulted in its being dominated by people from the city and state. Most ACLU funding came from philanthropies, such as the Garland Fund.|$|E
