2500|$|Norwood {{eventually}} {{decided to}} scrap {{most of the}} project, and instead enlisted Timbaland, with whom the couple had previously worked on Kiley Dean's unreleased Simple Girl album, as the album's main contributor. Impressed by Timaland's input, Norwood rediscovered the musical affection, she had missed on Full Moon and its technical priority. [...] "I made the change because I needed to evolve. I needed to explore my talent and versatility and see if I had another side to me, another sound," [...] she said about collaborating. [...] "I wanted to do my own thing, and I've always {{wanted to work with}} Timbaland [...] and see how my voice would sound over his tracks. It was an edgier Brandy, a sassier sound, but still with a lot of heart and a lot of passion." [...] With the help of Timbaland protégés such as Candice Nelson, Steve [...] "Static" [...] Garrett, and co-producer Walter Millsap III the pair worked on what was tentatively titled B-Rocka — a nickname actually given to her by Jerkins — and originally planned for a Christmas 2003 release.

The song was critically appreciated but achieved mediocre success around the globe, reaching {{the top ten}} of the UK Singles Chart and the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles Sales charts. In Eurasia and Australia, the album's title track served as the album's second single. Released to greater success than [...] "Talk About Our Love" [...] in almost all the countries it was released to, the track reached number eleven in the United Kingdom and made it to top thirty in France and Ireland. In North America, [...] "Who Is She 2 U" [...] was released as the album's second and final single. Suffering from low airplay, the song never {{made it out of}} {{the lower half of the}} Billboard Hot 100 and emerged as one of Norwood's lowest-charting singles yet.

Eleventh track, the soulful and minimalistic [...] "Say You Will" [...] saw a woman ready to settle down, and urging her mate to join her in a domestic life. [...] "How I Feel", a serene, smoky ballad, featured Norwood warning her mate that his busy life was slowly pushing her away. The song was blend of the adult-oriented urban pop of her former albums, and the more ambient, bluesy work she was dabbling with. [...] "Should I Go", based upon Coldplay's song [...] "Clocks", is built on percussive beats, syncopated handclaps and a piano riff. Lyrically, Norwood as the protagonist openly talks about contemplating stepping away from the music business, admitting that she's {{trying to figure out where}} she fits in today.|$|E
