40|$|CO 2 {{sequestration}} {{is one of}} {{the proposed}} methods for reducing anthropogenic CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere and therefore mitigating global climate change. Few studies on storing CO 2 in an aquifer have been conducted on a regional scale. This study offers a conceptual approach to increasing the storage efficiency of CO 2 injection in saline formations and investigates what an actual CO 2 storage project might entail using field data for the Woodbine aquifer in East Texas. The study considers three aquifer management strategies for injecting CO 2 emissions from nearby coal-fired power plants into the Woodbine aquifer. The aquifer management strategies studied are <b>bulk</b> CO 2 <b>injection,</b> and two CO 2 -brine displacement strategies. A conceptual model performed with homogeneous and average reservoir properties reveals that <b>bulk</b> <b>injection</b> of CO 2 pressurizes the aquifer, has a storage efficiency of 0. 46 % and can only last for 20 years without risk of fracturing the CO 2 injection wells. The CO 2 -brine displacement strategy can continue injecting CO 2 for as many as 240 years until CO 2 begins to break through in the production wells. This offers 12 times greater CO 2 storage efficiency than the <b>bulk</b> <b>injection</b> strategy. A full field simulation with a geological model based on existing aquifer data validates the storage capacity claims made by the conceptual model. A key feature in the geological model is the Mexia-Talco fault system that serves as a likely boundary between the saline aquifer region suitable for CO 2 storage and an updip fresh water region. Simulation results show that CO 2 does not leak into the fresh water region of the iv aquifer after 1000 years of monitoring if the faults have zero transmissibility, but a negligible volume of brine eventually gets through the mostly sealing fault system as pressure across the faults slowly equilibrates during the monitoring period. However, for fault transmissibilities of 0. 1 and 1, both brine and CO 2 leak into the fresh water aquifer in increasing amounts for both <b>bulk</b> <b>injection</b> and CO 2 -brine displacement strategies. In addition, brine production wells draw some fresh water into the saline aquifer if the Mexia-Talco fault system is not sealing. A CO 2 storage project in the Woodbine aquifer would impact as many as 15 counties with high-pressure CO 2 pipelines stretching as long as 875 km from the CO 2 source to the injection site. The required percentage of power plant energy capacity was 7. 43 % for <b>bulk</b> <b>injection,</b> 7. 9 % for the external brine disposal case, and 10. 2 % for the internal saturated brine injection case.

Based on Stamey score four patients are continent at the end and nine patients according to the pad count. The average pad count decreased significantly. Remarkable was the high rate of dislocations and revisions and patients' satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: ProACT is a less invasive treatment compared to the AUS.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{clinical}} practice update expert review is to describe the key principles {{in the use of}} surgical interventions and device-aided therapy for managing fecal incontinence (FI) and defecatory disorders. The best practices outlined in this review are based on relevant publications, including systematic reviews and expert opinion (when applicable). Best Practice Advice 1 : A stepwise approach should be followed for management of FI. Conservative therapies (diet, fluids, techniques to improve evacuation, a bowel training program, management of diarrhea and constipation with diet and medications if necessary) will benefit approximately 25 % of patients and should be tried first. Best Practice Advice 2 : Pelvic floor retraining with biofeedback therapy is recommended for patients with FI who do not respond to the conservative measures indicated above. Best Practice Advice 3 : Perianal bulking agents such as intra-anal injection of dextranomer may be considered when conservative measures and biofeedback therapy fail. Best Practice Advice 4 : Sacral nerve stimulation should be considered for patients with moderate or severe FI in whom symptoms have not responded after a 3 -month or longer trial of conservative measures and biofeedback therapy and who do not have contraindications to these procedures. Best Practice Advice 5 : Until further evidence is available, percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation should not be used for managing FI in clinical practice. Best Practice Advice 6 : Barrier devices should be offered to patients who have failed conservative or surgical therapy, or in those who have failed conservative therapy who do not want or are not eligible for more invasive interventions. Best Practice Advice 7 : Anal sphincter repair (sphincteroplasty) should be considered in postpartum women with FI and in patients with recent sphincter injuries. In patients who present later with symptoms of FI unresponsive to conservative and biofeedback therapy and evidence of sphincter damage, sphincteroplasty may be considered when perianal <b>bulking</b> <b>injection</b> and sacral nerve stimulation are not available or have proven unsuccessful. Best Practice Advice 8 : The artificial anal sphincter, dynamic graciloplasty, may be considered for patients with medically refractory severe FI who have failed treatment or are not candidates for barrier devices, sacral nerve stimulation, perianal <b>bulking</b> <b>injection,</b> sphincteroplasty and a colostomy. Best Practice Advice 9 : Major anatomic defects (eg, rectovaginal fistula, full-thickness rectal prolapse, fistula in ano, or cloaca-like deformity) should be rectified with surgery. Best Practice Advice 10 : A colostomy should be considered in patients with severe FI who have failed conservative treatment and have failed or are not candidates for barrier devices, minimally invasive surgical interventions, and sphincteroplasty. Best Practice Advice 11 : A magnetic anal sphincter device may be considered for patients with medically refractory severe FI who have failed or are not candidates for barrier devices, perianal <b>bulking</b> <b>injection,</b> sacral nerve stimulation, sphincteroplasty, or a colostomy. Data regarding efficacy are limited and 40 % of patients had moderate or severe complications. Best Practice Advice 12 : For defecatory disorders, biofeedback therapy is the treatment of choice. Best Practice Advice 13 : Based on limited evidence, sacral nerve stimulation should not be used for managing defecatory disorders in clinical practice. Best Practice Advice 14 : Anterograde colonic enemas are not effective in the long term for management of defecatory disorders. Best Practice Advice 15 : The stapled transanal rectal resection and related procedures should not be routinely performed for correction of structural abnormalities in patients with defecatory disorders...|$|R

As such, treatment can vary immensely depending on the clinical presentations, ranging from behavioral modification to medicinal thera-pies to surgical procedures. First-line management for all urinary incontinence includes lifestyle and behavioral modifications. Historically, treatment options for urgency urinary incontinence were predominantly antimuscarinics, while more recent therapies include oral beta- 3 agonist administration, sacral neuromodulation, onabotulinumtoxinA injection, and posterior tibial nerve stimulation.

40|$|The goal {{of stress}} {{incontinence}} surgery {{is to prevent}} opening of the urethra during increases in intra-abdominal pressure. Greater refinements {{in the understanding of}} the pathophysiology of incontinence and experience with newer treatments have extended surgical thinking beyond the familiar paradigm 2 ̆ 2 to place the urethra in a high retropubic position. 2 ̆ 2 When incontinence is associated with vaginal hypermobility, vaginal support may be sufficient to restore continence if the suburethral vaginal wall is sufficiently strong, an evaluation which must often be made by physical examination alone. However, when the vaginal wall is weak, the urethra will require an alternative form of support, usually a sling. If the urethra is intrinsically deficient, vaginal support may not be sufficient to prevent opening during increased intra-abdominal pressure, and coaptation by sling obstruction or periurethral <b>bulking</b> <b>injection</b> may be required.
