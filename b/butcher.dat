5|$|Other sites {{show more}} circumstantial {{evidence}} of mammoth hunting, such as piled bones bearing <b>butcher</b> marks. Some {{of these sites}} are not closely associated with Clovis points. The Lehner Mammoth-Kill Site and the Dent Site, where multiple juvenile and adult mammoths have been found with <b>butcher</b> marks and in association with Clovis points, were once interpreted as the killing of entire herds by Clovis hunters. However, isotope {{studies have shown that}} the accumulations represent individual deaths at different seasons of the year, and therefore not herds killed in single incidents. Many other such assemblages of bones with <b>butcher</b> marks may also represent accumulations over time, and are therefore ambiguous as evidence for large scale hunting.|$|E

5|$|England won {{the first}} Test with John Snow and David Brown {{claiming}} 13 wickets between them. A draw followed in Lord's, but England won the final match in a dramatic fashion. The West Indies in a seemingly strong position of 219/3 required 84 runs for victory. They suffered a late innings collapse however as <b>Butcher,</b> Sobers and Lloyd fell within 16 minutes, which ultimately led to England winning by 30 runs to win the series 2–0. It seemed that England would begin to dominate the West Indies, {{with many of the}} key West Indian players such as <b>Butcher,</b> Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith retiring in 1969. Illingworth would be the last England captain to win the Wisden Trophy for 31 years.|$|E

5|$|In Escape from <b>Butcher</b> Bay, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} Richard B. Riddick and {{attempts}} {{to break out of}} <b>Butcher</b> Bay prison. The game incorporates elements from video game genres such as first-person shooter, adventure and stealth, and is played primarily from a first-person perspective, though the camera switches to a third-person perspective during certain scenes. Unlike many first-person shooters, the game contains no head-up display; on-screen cues are limited to flashes when a new weapon is selected, and small, white boxes that display the player character's health when damage is taken. Health can be replenished in designated areas throughout the game. By finding cigarette packs hidden in levels, the player can unlock concept art and video files.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to other film tie-in games, which often closely follow {{the events of}} their source material, the development team of Escape from <b>Butcher</b> Bay focused on differentiating the game from The Chronicles of Riddick. They sought to explore Riddick's character in a prison break setting, and took inspiration from films such as Escape from Alcatraz. Starbreeze was also inspired by video games such as GoldenEye 007 and the Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series. The opening sequence, in which Riddick is escorted into <b>Butcher</b> Bay, {{is a tribute to}} Half-Life, and the game's hand-to-hand combat was inspired by Punch-Out!!. Starbreeze focused solely on developing the game's single-player mode, and did not include multiplayer; the company believed that such a mode would require a design team twice as large and another year of development.|$|E

40|$|Zoonotic {{diseases}} {{present an}} ongoing public health concern. Most human infections with zoonoses come from livestock, including pigs, chickens, cattle, goats, sheep and camels. <b>Butchers</b> constitute the high risk {{group in the}} transmission of zoonotic diseases. The educational status and awareness regarding the information, identification and transmission of zoonotic diseases among this high risk group, is critical in controlling the spread of zoonotic diseases. Hence, a study {{has been designed to}} evaluate the educational status, awareness among the <b>butchers</b> regarding the various zoonotic diseases and their modes of transmission and the effluent treatment methods followed by the <b>butchers</b> in and around Proddatur, Andhra Pradesh. The survey revealed that 86 percent of the <b>butchers</b> had high school education and most of them acquired this profession from their ancestors. 60 percent of the <b>butchers</b> were having awareness regarding the commonly occurring zoonotic diseases, 81 percent of <b>butchers</b> identified the disease by observing the lesions and were familiar with their control. Some of the <b>butchers</b> follow the hygienic practices and majority of them (81. 4 %) were interested in attending training programmes pertaining to zoonotic diseases...|$|R
