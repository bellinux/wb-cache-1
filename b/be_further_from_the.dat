5|$|Women {{were not}} {{explicitly}} banned from voting in Great Britain until the 1832 Reform Act and the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act. In England the suffrage movement existed {{before and after}} the 1832 act, but did not form a national organisation until the creation of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1872. Although there were notable exceptions such as the working-class areas of Lancashire, the women's suffrage movement in England was predominantly a middle-class movement. In Wales there were only two narrow bands of wealthy society in the Anglicised north and south coastal areas. Much of the female population of an emerging 19th century Wales was based in the low-waged, densely-populated, industrialised valleys of the south. At first women found work in metalworking and coal extraction, but then faced mass unemployment after the 1842 Mines and Collieries Act had prohibited them from working underground. The coal mining industry, with its absence of pithead baths, led to unpaid women's employment as the need to keep both their homes and the family's menfolk clean became a never ending task. This led to the image of the stoic Welsh Mam, a matriarch of the home, but little could <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> truth in a society controlled by men.|$|E

25|$|The recent anti-Latin resentment in the Empire {{led to the}} Crusader states {{losing their}} {{protection}} from Byzantium. However, whilst the Crusader states should not and did not rely on Byzantium for protection, the Byzantines certainly did in that it kept the aggressive expansionism of Islam in check. This could not <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> truth {{in regards to the}} Principality of Antioch. With the fall of Jerusalem in 1187 to Saladin it was Western Europe that immediately posed a threat to the Empire. A new Crusade was declared by the recently elected Pope Gregory VIII.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a popular}} {{misconception}} among the general public that most Jews went to their deaths passively. Nothing could <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> truth. Jewish resistance to the Nazis comprised not only their armed struggle but also spiritual and cultural opposition which gave the Jews dignity despite the inhumane conditions {{of life in the}} ghettos. Many forms of resistance were present, even though the elders were terrified by the prospect of mass retaliation against the women and children in the case of anti-Nazi revolt. As the German authorities undertook to liquidate the ghettos, armed resistance was offered in over 100 locations on either side of Polish-Soviet border of 1939, overwhelmingly in eastern Poland. The uprisings erupted in 5 major cities, 45 provincial towns, 5 major concentration and extermination camps, as well as in at least 18 forced labor camps. Notably, the only rebellions in Nazi camps were Jewish.|$|E
500|$|Zeta Psi ("Zete") at Dartmouth College {{was founded}} in 1853 as the Psi Epsilon chapter of the {{national}} fraternity, and was the fifth fraternity founded at the college. [...] The fraternity became inactive in 1863, but was revived from 1871 through 1873 after which it again became inactive. [...] The current Psi Epsilon Chapter of Zeta Psi at Dartmouth was established in 1920. [...] In 2001, the Dartmouth chapter was derecognized by the college because [...] "the fraternity harassed specific fellow students and violated ethical standards that Dartmouth student organizations agree to uphold, by periodically creating and circulating among Zeta Psi members 'newsletters' that purported to describe situations, some of them of a sexual nature, of various members of the fraternity and other students." [...] Zeta Psi, meanwhile, countered that [...] "nothing could <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> truth... Dartmouth College lacks jurisdiction to punish Psi Epsilon of Zeta Psi's for alleged violations of its own rules or regulations,". [...] From 2001 to 2006, Zeta Psi continued to operate as an independent fraternity, not officially recognized by Dartmouth College. In January 2007, Dartmouth College announced an agreement that would allow Zeta Psi to reorganize on campus as early as 2009. Part of the agreement dictated that the organization [...] "go dark", with no activities or recruiting, for a period of two years. [...] During these two years, alumni raised millions of dollars and the physical plant was entirely gutted and renovated, with a three-story addition being constructed on the west-side of the house. Also, the basement was enlarged. [...] On October 12, 2009, the Psi Epsilon Association of Zeta Psi Fraternity (Dartmouth Zete's alumni association) announced that 35 undergraduates had joined the newly re-recognized fraternity. [...] , after only little more than a year, Zete has around 60 brothers and counting.|$|E

Folkerts-Landau claimed that the economic prospects after a [...] "yes" [...] vote were [...] "incomprehensible," [...] citing Winston Churchill's 1925 Gold Standard decision and the actions of America's Federal Reserve that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s, as other mistakes of a similar magnitude. The Swiss UBS financial services company supported the position of the Deutsche Bank.|$|E
2500|$|In guided {{missiles}} {{where the}} fins {{can be moved}} to trim the vehicles in different angles of attack, the center of pressure {{is the center of}} pressure of the flow field at that angle of attack for the undeflected fin position. [...] This is the center of pressure of any small change in the angle of attack (as defined above). [...] Once again for positive static stability, this definition of center of pressure requires that the center of pressure <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nose than the center of gravity. [...] This ensures that any increased forces resulting from increased angle of attack results in increased restoring moment to drive the missile back to the trimmed position. [...] In missile analysis, positive static margin implies that the complete vehicle makes a restoring moment for any angle of attack from the trim position.|$|E
2500|$|The International Crimes Tribunal {{set up by}} Bangladesh in 2009 {{to prosecute}} {{surviving}} collaborators of the pro-Pakistani militias in 1971 {{has been the subject}} of strong criticism in Pakistani political and military circles. On 30 November 2015, the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif retreated from earlier positions and said that it denies any role by Pakistan in atrocities in Bangladesh. A statement of the Pakistani Foreign Ministry, after summoning the Acting Bangladeshi High Commissioner, said that [...] "Pakistan also rejected insinuation of complicity in committing crimes or war atrocities. Nothing could <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> truth". The statement marked a growing trend of genocide denial in Pakistan, which picked up pace after controversial Indian academic Sarmila Bose accused the Mukti Bahini of war crimes. Bose has claimed that there is greater denial in Bangladesh of war crimes which were committed by Bengalis against Biharis.|$|E

2500|$|The {{campaign}} {{then moved}} towards the January 19 South Carolina primary, the state which effectively ended McCain's 2000 campaign for President. Unlike 2000, McCain {{had the support}} of much of the state Republican establishment, both in terms of endorsements and campaign staff support. Nevertheless a bit of 2000 surfaced when a group of unknown size called [...] "Vietnam Veterans Against John McCain" [...] set up a website and began sending crude mailers to media members alleging that McCain passed military information to the North Vietnamese during his time as a POW. McCain set up a Truth Squad to combat such attacks and emphasized that he was supported by 75 former POWs. Orson Swindle, who was a POW with McCain, called the flier a [...] "vicious" [...] fraud. [...] "Nothing could <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> truth," [...] Swindle said. [...] "I know because I was there. The truth is, the North Vietnamese offered John McCain early release, and he refused." [...] After that, however, there was {{little in the way of}} dirty tricks during the rest of the campaign.|$|E

[...] The Connecticut Democratic Party filed an FEC complaint against Linda McMahon's campaign in October, claiming the WWE's [...] "Fan Appreciation Day" [...] was an [...] "illegal campaign contribution". The complaint also cited the taping of [...] "Smackdown in Bridgeport Harbor Yard" [...] on Election Day, claiming it intended to suppress voter turnout in a Democratic-leaning community.|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to George Will's [...] "Al Gore's Green Guilt" [...] Roger Revelle—our {{father and}} the [...] "father" [...] of the {{greenhouse}} effect—remained deeply concerned about global warming {{until his death in}} July 1991. That same year he wrote: [...] "The scientific base for a greenhouse warming is too uncertain to justify drastic action at this time." [...] Will and other critics of Sen. Al Gore have seized these words to suggest that Revelle, who was also Gore's professor and mentor, renounced his belief in global warming. Nothing could <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> truth. When Revelle inveighed against [...] "drastic" [...] action, he was using that adjective in its literal sense—measures that would cost trillions of dollars. Up until his death, he thought that extreme measures were premature. But he continued to recommend immediate prudent steps to mitigate and delay climatic warming. Some of those steps go well beyond anything Gore or other national politicians have yet to advocate. [...] Revelle proposed a range of approaches to address global warming. Inaction was not one of them. He agreed with the adage [...] "look before you leap," [...] but he never said [...] "sit on your hands." ...|$|E

2500|$|For unguided rockets {{the trim}} {{position}} is typically zero {{angle of attack}} {{and the center of}} pressure is defined {{to be the center of}} pressure of the resultant flow field on the entire vehicle resulting from a very small angle of attack (that is, the center of pressure in the limit as angle of attack goes to zero). [...] For positive stability in missiles, the total vehicle center of pressure defined as given above must <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nose of the vehicle than the center of gravity. [...] In missiles at lower angles of attack, the contributions to the center of pressure are dominated by the nose, wings, and fins. [...] The normalized normal force coefficient derivative with respect to the angle of attack of each component multiplied by the location of the center of pressure can be used to compute a centroid representing the total center of pressure. [...] The center of pressure of the added flow field is behind the center of gravity and the additional force [...] "points" [...] in the direction of the added angle of attack; this produces a moment that pushes the vehicle back to the trim position.|$|E
