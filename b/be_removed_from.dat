5|$|A simple {{frequency}} allocation {{problem can be}} specified as follows: a number of transmitters in a wireless network must choose a frequency channel on which they will transmit data. To avoid interference, transmitters that are geographically close should use channels with frequencies that are far apart. If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define 'geographically close' and 'far apart', then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism. It should go from the graph of transmitters G, with edges between pairs that are geographically close, to the graph of channels H, with edges between channels that are far apart. While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs that are not close but could interfere because of geographical features can added {{to the edges of}} G. Those that do not communicate at the same time can <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> it. Similarly, channel pairs that are far apart but exhibit harmonic interference can <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the edge set of H.|$|E
