50|$|The ZC3H12B gene is {{composed}} of 19,709 <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> (<b>bp)</b> and contains 5 exons. It {{is located on the}} X chromosome at q12 on the plus strand.|$|R
50|$|Microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), {{also known}} as {{alternative}} nonhomologous end-joining (Alt-NHEJ) {{is one of the}} pathways for repairing double-strand breaks in DNA. As reviewed by McVey and Lee, the foremost distinguishing property of MMEJ is the use of 5-25 <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> (<b>bp)</b> microhomologous sequences during the alignment of broken ends before joining, thereby resulting in deletions flanking the original break. Thus, MMEJ is frequently associated with chromosome abnormalities such as deletions, translocations, inversions and other complex rearrangements.|$|E
5000|$|Orange G {{can be used}} as a color marker {{to monitor}} the process of agarose gel electrophoresis, running {{approximately}} at the size of a 50 <b>Base</b> <b>pair</b> (<b>bp)</b> DNA molecule, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol can also be used for this purpose.

5000|$|Commonly used color markers include Bromophenol blue, Cresol Red, Orange G and Xylene cyanol. Generally speaking, Orange G migrates {{faster than}} bromophenol blue, which migrates faster than xylene cyanol, but the {{apparent}} [...] "sizes" [...] of these dyes (compared to DNA molecules) {{varies with the}} concentration of agarose and the buffer system used. For instance, in a 1% agarose gel made in TAE buffer (Tris-acetate-EDTA), xylene cyanol migrates {{at the speed of}} a 3000 <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> (<b>bp)</b> molecule of DNA and bromophenol blue migrates at 400 bp.

50|$|Given a {{sequence}} of any length, the first step that needs done is to enter the sequence into a sequencing program, have it sequenced, and return <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> (<b>bp)</b> reads of a certain length. Since {{there is not a}} sequencing program that is completely accurate, there will always be some reads which contain errors. The most common sequencing method is the shotgun method, which is the method most probably used on sequence 2. Once a method is decided on, you have to specify the length of the bp reads you would like it to return. In the case of sequence 2, it returned 7-bp reads with all errors made during the process noted in red.|$|E
50|$|Hin {{recombinase}} is a 21kD protein {{composed of}} 198 amino acids that {{is found in}} the bacteria Salmonella. Hin belongs to the serine recombinase family of DNA invertases in which it relies on the active site serine to initiate DNA cleavage and recombination. The related protein, gamma-delta resolvase shares high similarity to Hin, of which much structural work has been done, including structures bound to DNA and reaction intermediates. Hin functions to invert a 900 <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> (<b>bp)</b> DNA segment within the salmonella genome that contains a promoter for downstream flagellar genes, fljA and fljB. Inversion of the intervening DNA alternates the direction of the promoter and thereby alternates expression of the flagellar genes. This is advantageous to the bacterium as a means of escape from the host immune response.|$|E
50|$|After {{subcloning}} {{the human}} nestin gene into plasmid vectors, Dahlstrand et al. determined the nucleotide sequence of all coding regions {{and parts of}} the introns. In order to establish the boundaries of the introns, they used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify a fragment made from human fetal brain cDNA using two primers located in the first and fourth exon, respectively. The resulting 270 <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> (<b>bp)</b> long fragment was then sequenced directly in its entirety, and intron positions precisely located by comparison with the genomic sequence. Putative initiation and stop codons for the human nestin gene were found at the same positions as in the rat gene, in regions where overall similarity was very high. Based on this assumption, the human nestin gene encodes a protein with 1618 amino acids, i.e. 187 amino acids shorter than the rat protein.|$|E

There is a second, less prevalent transcript variant of NHLRC2; this non-coding isoform is 522 bp of retained intron.|$|R
50|$|DNA Nanoball Sequencing {{involves}} isolating DNA {{that is to}} be sequenced, shearing it {{into small}} 400 - 500 <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> (<b>bp)</b> fragments, ligating adapter sequences to the fragments, and circularizing the fragments. The circular fragments are copied by rolling circle replication resulting in many single-stranded copies of each fragment. The DNA copies concatenate head to tail in a long strand, and are compacted into a DNA nanoball. The nanoballs are then adsorbed onto a sequencing flow-cell. Unchained sequencing reactions interrogate specific nucleotide locations in the nanoball by ligating fluorescent probes to the DNA. The color of the fluorescence at each interrogated position is recorded through a high-resolution camera. Bioinformatics are used to analyze the fluorescence data and make a base call, and for mapping the 35-bp mate pair reads to a reference genome. The genome is assembled and any polymorphisms present in the sequence are identified.|$|E
50|$|A <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> (<b>bp)</b> is a unit {{consisting}} of two nucleobases bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. They form {{the building blocks of}} the DNA double helix, and contribute to the folded structure of both DNA and RNA. Dictated by specific hydrogen bonding patterns, Watson-Crick base pairs (guanine-cytosine and adenine-thymine) allow the DNA helix to maintain a regular helical structure that is subtly dependent on its nucleotide sequence. The complementary nature of this based-paired structure provides a backup copy of all genetic information encoded within double-stranded DNA. The regular structure and data redundancy provided by the DNA double helix make DNA well suited to the storage of genetic information, while base-pairing between DNA and incoming nucleotides provides the mechanism through which DNA polymerase replicates DNA, and RNA polymerase transcribes DNA into RNA. Many DNA-binding proteins can recognize specific base pairing patterns that identify particular regulatory regions of genes.|$|E
5000|$|Cre {{recombinase}} is a tyrosine recombinase enzyme {{derived from}} the P1 Bacteriophage. The enzyme uses a topoisomerase I like mechanism to carry out site specific recombination events. The enzyme (38kDa) {{is a member of}} the integrase family of site specific recombinase and it is known to catalyse the site specific recombination event between two DNA recognition sites (LoxP sites). This 34 <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> (<b>bp)</b> loxP recognition site consists of two 13 bp palindromic sequences which flank an 8bp spacer region. The products of Cre-mediated recombination at loxP sites are dependent upon the location and relative orientation of the loxP sites. Two separate DNA species both containing loxP sites can undergo fusion as the result of Cre mediated recombination. DNA sequences found between two loxP sites are said to be [...] "floxed". In this case the products of Cre mediated recombination depends upon the orientation of the loxP sites. DNA found between two loxP sites oriented in the same direction will be excised as a circular loop of DNA whilst intervening DNA between two loxP sites that are opposingly orientated will be inverted. The enzyme requires no additional cofactors (such as ATP) or accessory proteins for its function.|$|E

About 30 polymorphisms are known {{most of which are}} single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP).|$|R
50|$|Assembly {{standard}} 10 {{was developed}} by Tom Knight, and is {{the most widely used}} assembly standard. It involves the use of restriction enzymes. Every BioBrick part is a DNA sequence which is carried by a circular plasmid, which acts a vector. The vector acts as a transport system to carry the BioBrick parts. The first approach towards a BioBrick standard was the introduction of standard sequences, the prefix and suffix sequences, which flank the 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends of the DNA part respectively. These standard sequences encode specific restriction enzyme sites. The prefix sequence encodes EcoRI (E) and Xbal (X) sites, while the suffix sequence encodes SpeI (S) and PstI (P) sites. The prefix and the suffix are not considered part of the BioBrick part. To facilitate the assembly process, the BioBrick part itself must not contain any of these restriction sites. During the assembly of two different parts, one of the plasmids is digested with EcoRI and SpeI. The plasmid carrying the other BioBrick part is digested with EcoRI and Xbal. This leaves both plasmids with 4 <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> (<b>bp)</b> overhangs at the 5’ and 3’ ends. The EcoRI sites will ligate since they are complementary to each other. The Xbal and SpeI sites will also ligate as the digestion produces compatible ends. Now, both the DNA parts are in one plasmid. The ligation produces an 8 base pair ‘scar’ site between the two BioBrick parts. Since the scar site is a hybrid of the Xbal and SpeI sites, it is not recognized by either restriction enzyme. The prefix and suffix sequences remain unchanged by this digestion and ligation process, which allows for subsequent assembly steps with more BioBrick parts.|$|E
