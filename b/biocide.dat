40|$|Introduction. This paper {{discusses}} the most topical {{issues of the}} Biocidal Products Directive (BPD) implementation, in particular, {{the impact on the}} social and health safety on various population groups, environmental safety, trade, manufacturing and their prospectives. The Aim of the Study – to evaluate the development of the <b>biocides</b> market and its participants in Lithuania. The Tasks – to evaluate the impact of the approximation of the laws of Lithuania and the European Union, concerning the placing of <b>biocides</b> on the market and its participants. Methods. Based on the "Methodology for impact of the regulatory laws assessment", the study identifies changes in the <b>biocides</b> market and the activity of its participants. A sample survey of manufacturers of <b>biocides</b> and of the users (personal health care institutions and preventive disinfection and disinfestation enterprises) was conducted. The analysis and evaluation of the available <b>biocides</b> database was also undertaken and SPSS statistics software was used to measure the statistical significance of the results. The market was assessed by the application of the criteria laid down in the BPD, in particular, the number of authorized <b>biocides,</b> distribution of product types, distribution of <b>biocides</b> according to categories of users, distribution of use of identified and notified active substances of <b>biocides.</b> Results. The study demonstrated that the Lithuanian <b>biocides</b> market has changed following the implementation of the BPD: in particular, number of authorized <b>biocides</b> has increased as well as diversity of product types, use of notified active substances in <b>biocides</b> has increased as well as number of <b>biocides</b> intended for professional users. The comparative analysis of the data gathered from participants of the Lithuanian market points to improvements, in particular, the increased access to information by manufacturers in relation to active substances in biocides; in Lithuania manufactured <b>biocides</b> quality confirms the requirements of the BPD; variety of <b>biocides</b> used by preventive disinfection and disinfestation enterprises has expanded; the reduced average number of medical professionals directly contacting with <b>biocides</b> and the trend towards the reduced use of <b>biocides</b> concentrates. Conclusions. The approximation of the laws of Lithuania and the European Union concerning the placing of <b>biocides</b> on the market has had a positive impact on changes in <b>biocides</b> market and on its participants, ensuring public health and environmental safety quality...|$|R

30|$|Microbial {{activity}} offshore {{is managed}} {{by a number}} of different methods. Injection of <b>biocides</b> at the topside and/or to the injection water is the most common method. <b>Biocides</b> suppress microbial growth and activity, particularly in reservoirs where souring is confined to the zone around injection well (Gieg et al. 2011). Common <b>biocides</b> for controlling microbial activity include glutaraldehyde, tetrakis (hydroxymethyl) phosphonium sulfate (THPS), benzalkonium chloride, formaldehyde, and sodium hypochlorite (Videla and Herrera 2005; Kaur et al. 2009). <b>Biocides</b> are relatively simple to administer, however, continued use of them can lead to increase in biocide-resistant microbial communities. <b>Biocides</b> are potentially hazardous to oilfield personnel and the environment and difficult to inject deep into reservoir making treatment of SRB distant from injection well challenging.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Biocides</b> are {{chemical}} substances that can deter or kill the microorganisms responsible for biofouling. The {{rapid expansion of}} the aquaculture industry is having {{a significant impact on}} the marine ecosystems. As the industry expands, it requires the use of more drugs, disinfectants and antifoulant compounds (<b>biocides)</b> to eliminate the microorganisms in the aquaculture facilities. The use of <b>biocides</b> in the aquatic environment, however, has proved to be harmful as it has toxic effects on the marine environment. Organic booster <b>biocides</b> were recently introduced as alternatives to the organotin compounds found in antifouling products after restrictions were imposed on the use of tributyltin (TBT). The replacement products are generally based on copper metal oxides and organic <b>biocides.</b> The <b>biocides</b> that are most commonly used in antifouling paints include chlorothalonil, dichlofluanid, DCOIT (4, 5 -dichloro- 2 -n-octyl- 4 -isothiazolin- 3 -one, Sea-nine 211 ®), Diuron, Irgarol 1051, TCMS pyridine (2, 3, 3, 6 -tetrachloro- 4 -methylsulfonyl pyridine), zinc pyrithione and Zineb. There are two types of risks associated with the use of <b>biocides</b> in aquaculture: (i) predators and humans may ingest the fish and shellfish that have accumulated in these contaminants and (ii) the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. This paper provides an overview of the effects of antifouling (AF) <b>biocides</b> on aquatic organisms. It also provides some insights into the effects and risks of these compounds on non-target organisms...|$|R
25|$|This problem however was {{resolved}} {{with the use}} of so-called self-polishing paints, in which the <b>biocide</b> was released at a slower rate as the seawater reacted with the surface layer of the paint. More recently, copper-based anti-fouling paints have been used because they are less toxic than TBT in aquatic environment, but are only effective against marine animal life, and not so much weed growth. Non-stick coatings contain no <b>biocide,</b> but have extremely slippery surfaces which prevents most fouling and makes it easier to clean the little fouling that does occur. Natural biocides are found on marine organisms such as coral and sponges and also prevent fouling if applied to a vessel. Creating a difference in electrical charge between the hull and sea water is a common practice in the prevention of fouling. This technology has proven to be effective, but is easily damaged and can be expensive. Finally, microscopic prickles can be added to a coating, and depending on length and distribution have shown the ability to prevent the attachment of most biofouling.|$|E
25|$|Plasticized PVC is {{a common}} {{material}} for medical gloves. Due to vinyl gloves having less flexibility and elasticity, several guidelines recommend either latex or nitrile gloves for clinical care and procedures that require manual dexterity and/or that involve patient contact {{for more than a}} brief period. Vinyl gloves show poor resistance to many chemicals, including glutaraldehyde-based products and alcohols used in formulation of disinfectants for swabbing down work surfaces or in hand rubs. The additives in PVC are also known to cause skin reactions such as allergic contact dermatitis. These are for example the antioxidant bisphenol A, the <b>biocide</b> benzisothiazolinone, propylene glycol/adipate polyester and ethylhexylmaleate.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{treating}} the circulating cooling water in large industrial cooling tower systems to minimize scaling and fouling, the water should be filtered to remove particulates, and also be dosed with biocides and algaecides to prevent growths that could {{interfere with the}} continuous flow of the water. Under certain conditions, a biofilm of micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae can grow very rapidly in the cooling water, and can reduce the heat transfer efficiency of the cooling tower. Biofilm can be reduced or prevented by using chlorine or other chemicals. A normal industrial practice is to use two biocides, such as oxidizing and non-oxidizing types to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and to ensure a broader spectrum of attack. In most cases, a continual low level oxidizing <b>biocide</b> is used, then alternating to a periodic shock dose of non-oxidizing biocides.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAntifouling (AF) paints {{are used}} to prevent the {{attachment}} of living organisms to the submerged surfaces of ships, boats and aquatic structures, usually by the release of <b>biocides.</b> Apart from copper, organic booster <b>biocides</b> are the main active components in AF paints, but their use can {{have a negative impact}} on the marine environment. The direct effects of <b>biocides</b> on marine bacteria are poorly known. This work investigates the impact of two <b>biocides,</b> viz. diuron and tolylfluanid, on the growth and the viability of marine microorganisms and on their ability to form biofilms. The <b>biocides</b> in solution were found to inhibit growth of two strains of marine bacteria, viz. Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio vulnificus, at a high concentration (1000 microg ml(- 1)), but only a small effect on viability was observed. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed that the booster <b>biocides</b> decreased biofilm formation by both bacteria. At a concentration of 10 microg ml(- 1), the <b>biocides</b> inhibited cell attachment and reduced biofilm thickness on glass surfaces. The percentage of live cells in the biofilms was also reduced. The effect of the <b>biocides</b> on two diatoms, Fragilaria pinnata and Cylindrotheca closterium, was also evaluated in terms of growth rate, biomass, chlorophyll a content and attachment to glass. The results demonstrate that diuron and tolylfluanid are more active against diatoms than bacteria...|$|R

5000|$|Most {{antifouling}} coatings {{are based}} upon chemical compounds that inhibit fouling. When incorporated into marine coatings, these <b>biocides</b> leech into the immediate surroundings and minimize fouling. The classic synthetic antifouling agent is TBT. Natural <b>biocides</b> typically show lower environmental impact but variable effectiveness. Natural <b>biocides</b> are found {{in a variety of}} sources, including (sponges, algae, corals, sea urchins, bacteria, and sea-squirts), and include toxins, anaesthetics, and growth/attachment/metamorphosis-inhibiting molecules. [...] As a group, marine microalgae alone produce over 3600 secondary metabolites that play complex ecological roles including defense from predators, as well as antifouling protection, increasing scientific interest in the screening of marine natural products as natural <b>biocides.</b> Natural <b>biocides</b> are typically divided into two categories: terpenes (often containing unsaturated ligand groups and electronegative oxygen functional groups) and nonterpenes.|$|R
25|$|Biocides are {{chemical}} substances that deter the microorganisms responsible for biofouling. The {{chemical substances}} {{are incorporated into}} an anti-fouling surface coating, typically through physical adsorption or through chemical modification of the surface. Biofouling occurs on surfaces after formation of a biofilm. The biofilm creates a surface onto which successively larger microorganisms can attach. In marine environments this buildup usually concludes with barnacle attachment. The biocides often target the microorganisms that create the initial biofilm, typically bacteria. Once dead, {{they are unable to}} spread and can detach. Other biocides are toxic to larger organisms in biofouling, such as the fungi and algae. The most commonly used <b>biocide,</b> and anti-fouling agent, is the tributyltin moiety (TBT). It is toxic to both microorganisms and larger aquatic organisms. Biocides are also added to pool water, drinking water, and liquid lines for cooling electronics to control biological growth.|$|E
25|$|The {{deterioration}} of wood occurred at typically vulnerable areas, {{such as the}} exposed end grain of arches and muntins and where wood members intersect. The humidity in the building was a contributing factor to wood deterioration. The level of moisture in the building was exacerbated by two conditions. First, the building’s natural ventilation system had been removed in a past repair. The ventilators, which were originally located in the low wall area, had been filled in, and some ridge ventilators were inoperable. The air flow through the ventilators, which would have assisted in the evaporation of water, was not occurring. Second, the penetration of rain water from {{the exterior of the}} building, because of inadequate or deteriorated waterproofing, had increased the level of moisture in the wood. The copper sheathing that had originally capped the arch exteriors, in addition to acting as a moisture barrier, may have been acting as a <b>biocide</b> through copper oxides inhibiting wood rot.|$|E
500|$|It {{is often}} {{impractical}} to store and use poisonous chlorine gas for water treatment, so alternative methods of adding chlorine are used.

These compounds are stable while solid and may be used in powdered, granular, or tablet form.

40|$|A 1999 {{desk study}} assesses the {{environmental}} risks of 93 industrial or other non-agricultural pesticides. The risks for aquatic ecosystems are emphasised, and various data on use pattern, dosages, emissions, physicochemistry, environmental fate and ecotoxicity are listed. The <b>biocides</b> {{have not been}} included {{in any of the}} environmental policy spearheads for <b>biocides</b> in the Netherlands, primarily due to lack of data. This lack is partially confirmed by the present study: e. g. experimental data on the effects to purification processes in sewage treatment plants are available for only four substances. This study also shows that 11 <b>biocides</b> can have an adverse impact on aquatic organisms (e. g. 2, 2 -dibromo- 3 -nitrilopropionamide as a slimicide in paper industries) and that 11 <b>biocides</b> probably have no adverse impact on aquatic organisms (e. g. zinc oxide as antifouling). A group of 17 <b>biocides</b> cannot be characterised for the environmental impact - although emission to surface water is indicated -, because there are no models, no ecotoxicological data or no data on the actual yearly industrial or domestic use. Some of these <b>biocides</b> are very toxic as seen in acute toxicity tests in the laboratory (e. g. disodium cyanodithioimido carbonate). As the environmental risk assessments in this study reflect realistic worst-case conditions, a follow-up study will be aimed at adequate risk assessments under more general conditions. In this way, the assessments for the potentially hazardous 11 <b>biocides</b> will be specified by a more precise exposure assessment and additional ecotoxicity data, if available. More precise data on the actual use of <b>biocides</b> by industries are also required...|$|R
2500|$|Marine Biofouling is {{described}} as the undesirable buildup of microorganisms, plants, and animals on artificial surfaces immersed in water. Significant buildup of biofouling on marine vessels can be problematic.

Biocides can be either synthetic, such as tributyltin (TBT), [...] or natural, which are derived from bacteria or plants. TBT was historically the main <b>biocide</b> used for anti-fouling coatings, but more recently TBT compounds have been considered toxic chemicals which have negative effects on human and environment, and have been banned by the International Maritime Organization.

40|$|First, {{the status}} of <b>biocides</b> {{monitoring}} in Germany and other EU countries was evaluated.

To get a broader picture a first international workshop on <b>biocides</b> monitoring was organised {{on behalf of the}} German Environment Agency (UBA) and the NORMAN association. Main topics were prioritisation of <b>biocides</b> for inclusion in monitoring programmes, practical issues regarding sampling and analysis, and monitoring data evaluation. Based on a proposal from a previous project a prioritisation approach for <b>biocides</b> was optimised and executed. Compounds are evaluated for potential direct or indirect emissions, their potential to cause adverse effects, and their relevance for an occurrence in environmental compartments (e. g. water phase, suspended particulate matter, biota). Depending on the compartment, substance-specific properties relevant for partitioning between media, persistence and/or bioaccumulation are considered. To achieve a broader coverage of <b>biocides</b> in monitoring activities a proposal for a <b>biocides</b> monitoring programme was elaborated.
