50|$|Distinct vocalizations {{are used}} {{depending}} on whether they are for inter-group communication of extra-group communication. For inter-group communication, a short distance call is used, while for an extra-group communication call, a loud, shrill long distance call is used. Specific vocalizations are used when an adult <b>buffy-headed</b> <b>marmoset</b> discovers a source of food with others. Younger ones respond by running towards the calling marmoset, while expressing vocalizations of excitement. The dominant female will sometimes also express these vocalizations of excitement. If the food is not given, the female and younger marmosets will stay near the adult <b>buffy-headed</b> <b>marmoset</b> while conveying short vocalizations, to display their presence and express a need for food.|$|E
50|$|The <b>buffy-headed</b> <b>{{marmoset}}</b> (Callithrix flaviceps) is a {{rare species}} of marmoset endemic to the rainforests of south-eastern Brazil. It occurs in southern Espírito Santo and possibly northern Rio de Janeiro and its distribution extends into Minas Gerais.|$|E
50|$|Feliciano Miguel Abdala Private Natural Heritage Reserve (Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural Feliciano Miguel Abdala), {{formerly}} the Fazenda Montes Claros {{and then the}} Caratinga Biological Station, is a privately-owned sustainable use protected area {{in the state of}} Minas Gerais, Brazil. It contains an example of Atlantic Forest biome. The reserve is home to rare <b>buffy-headed</b> <b>marmosets</b> and to one of the last wild populations of northern muriqui woolly spider monkeys.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} the {{long-term}} study of the muriquis began Abdala was in his 70s. Besides the forest, his farm included an active coffee plantation and cattle ranch, and employed over 20 families whose houses were on the farm. Abdala put up researchers in his farmhouse until a small vacated house {{on the edge of}} the forest had been renovated. This house became the Caratinga Biological Station (Estação Biológica de Caratinga) in May 1983. The biological station was supported by Abdala, the Federal University of Minas Gerais, the World Wildlife Fund and the Brazilian Foundation for the Conservation of Nature (FBCN). Researchers found <b>buffy-headed</b> <b>marmosets,</b> an endangered species, as well as healthy populations of brown howler and tufted capuchin monkeys.|$|R
50|$|The {{average weight}} {{of an adult}} <b>buffy-headed</b> <b>marmoset</b> can range in weight {{anywhere}} between 119g to 710g. These marmosets have a low metabolic rate, {{as well as an}} enlarged cecum that allows consumption of food that is high in fiber.|$|E
50|$|Protected {{birds in}} the reserve include the red-browed amazon (Amazona rhodocorytha), white-necked hawk (Leucopternis lacernulatus), Atlantic black-breasted {{woodpecker}} (Celeus torquatus tinnunculus), rufous-brown solitaire (Cichlopsis leucogenys), purple-winged ground dove (Claravis godefrida), black-bellied thorntail (Discosura langsdorffi), Salvadori's antwren (Myrmotherula minor) and brown-backed parrotlet (Touit melanonotus).Protected mammals include the maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus), Atlantic titi (Callicebus personatus), northern muriqui (Brachyteles hypoxanthus), <b>buffy-headed</b> <b>marmoset</b> (Callithrix flaviceps), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and cougar (Puma concolor capricornensis).Other protected species include the black uruçu (Melipona capixaba) and pinthous mimic white (Moschoneura pinthous methymna).|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} small size, buffy-headed {{marmosets}} {{are susceptible to}} a wide range of predators. Common threats include ocelots, anacondas, and hawks, but many other animals such as toucans prey on them. The <b>buffy-headed</b> <b>marmoset</b> has four distinct patterns of predator avoidance. Primarily, buffy-headed marmosets avoid aerial predators through low-intensity alarm signals, emitting soft, closed-mouth whistles to warn other group members. A secondary behavior in dealing with aerial threats is a high-intensity alarm. These marmosets will send out a half-mouthed, open whistle to alert other members to take cover under branches or trees, sometimes immediately ceasing movement for the purpose of avoiding exposure. This pattern of avoidance is instinctive, and at times can result in these primates leaping downward from canopy to canopy in 10m jumps.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of the first long-term field study of the <b>buffy-headed</b> <b>marmoset,</b> Callirhrix flaviceps, a rare primate species with a small natural range in southeastern Brazil. The introductory discussion {{presents the}} species {{in the context of a}} review of the available literature on the taxonomy, evolution, behaviour and ecology of the primates of the family Callitrichidae. The study animals, study site and methodology are then described. A detailed description of seasonal fluctuations in the abundance and distribution of dietary resources at the site provides a frame of reference for the analysis of the study group's behaviour. General patterns in the group's use of time and space are outlined in the context of these variables and comparisons are made with other callitrichid species. A number of behavioural strategies are identified. A more detailed analysis of seasonal patterns in the group's foraging and feeding behaviour emphasizes the systematic nature of its exploitation of resources. The gum-feeding adaptation of the marmosets is seen as having far-reaching implications for many aspects of their behaviour and ecology. Behavioural specialisations for the capture of certain types of prey and the exploitation of secondary and disturbed forest habitats are also proposed. It is concluded that most features of the group's foraging behaviour support predictions drawn from optimality models, in the context of an overall 'time-minimising' strategy in particular. As much of the behavioural repertoire of this species appears to be broadly similar to that of other callitrichids, these findings offer a number of important insights into their ecological adaptations...|$|E
