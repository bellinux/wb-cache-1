5|$|Stunned, the {{remaining}} Chili Peppers, {{who had no}} suitable replacement for Frusciante, hired Arik Marshall to play {{the remaining}} dates after being forced to reschedule. Upon returning to Hollywood, the band placed {{an ad in the}} L.A. Weekly for open guitar auditions, which Kiedis considered to be a waste of time. After several months of unsuccessfully looking for a suitable guitarist, drummer Chad Smith suggested Dave Navarro. He had always been the band's first choice, but had <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> following the 1991 breakup of Jane's Addiction. Navarro eventually accepted the position after productive jam sessions.|$|E

This was Evans' second album as a leader, since New Jazz Conceptions, recorded two years earlier.

25|$|In June 2006, Nature {{launched}} {{an experiment in}} parallel open peer review: some articles that had been submitted to the regular anonymous process were also available online for open, identified public comment. The results were less than encouraging â€“ only 5% of authors {{agreed to participate in}} the experiment, and only 54% of those articles received comments. The editors have suggested that researchers may have <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to take part and were reluctant to make their names public. The knowledge that articles were simultaneously being subjected to anonymous peer review may also have affected the uptake.|$|E
25|$|On February 26, 2008 Houston Dynamo President Oliver Luck {{revealed}} the planned negotiations {{to the media}} stating that the Houston Dynamo would be managed in majority by original owners Anschutz Entertainment Group (who held 50% of ownership) along with newfound partners Gabriel Brener, head of Brener International Group, and multiple World and Olympic boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya (each with 25% ownership). De La Hoya has been seen wearing Dynamo colors on his boxing uniform with a small Houston Dynamo logo on his right leg in a fight against boxer Steve Forbes. He has also pledged to help find Dynamo a soccer-specific stadium, though he has <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> with training to participate significantly in Dynamo decision-making.

500|$|Several {{prominent}} Founders are {{notable for}} not {{participating in the}} Constitutional Convention. Thomas Jefferson was abroad, serving as the minister to France (nonetheless, Jefferson, {{in a letter to}} John Adams, would describe the delegates approvingly as a gathering of [...] "demi-gods"). John Adams was in Britain, serving as minister to that country, but he wrote home to encourage the delegates. Patrick Henry refused to participate because he [...] "smelt a rat in Philadelphia, tending toward the monarchy." [...] Also absent were John Hancock and Samuel Adams. Many of the states' older and more experienced leaders may have simply <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> with the local affairs of their states to attend the Convention, which had originally been planned to strengthen the existing Articles of Confederation, not to write a constitution for a completely new national government.|$|E

Donald of the CSIRO wrote: [...] "He has a truly enquiring mind, a constant capacity for lateral thinking, and an encyclopaedic knowledge {{of many things}} but of manners parasitological above all.

2500|$|In a later {{report to}} Robertson (24 Dec) Haig {{accepted}} the blame, {{stating that the}} troops had been tired {{as a result of}} the attack on Bourlon Wood which he had ordered. Esher had warned Haig (28 October) that Rawlinson was criticising Charteris (known as [...] "the Principal Boy"), and reported that he had told Rawlinson that Charteris had [...] "no influence" [...] over Haig and his information had never let him down. Derby warned Haig (7 December) to sack Charteris, as the War Cabinet and General Staff were displeased at his exaggerated claims of German weakness. Haig took responsibility and defended Charteris. After the battle, the press baron Lord Northcliffe reduced his support of Haig. He had recently been offended on a visit to GHQ, when Haig had <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to pay much attention to him. A Times editorial [...] "A Case for Inquiry" [...] (12 Dec) criticised Charteris for his [...] "fatuous estimates" [...] of German losses and morale and called for the sacking of [...] "every blunderer" [...] at GHQ. Haig assumed Lloyd George had inspired the article.|$|E
2500|$|Roberts {{had asked}} the CIGS John French {{to come and see}} him at Ascot on 19 March; French had <b>been</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> but invited Roberts to visit him when next in London. On the morning of 21 March Roberts and French had an acrimonious {{telephone}} conversation in which Roberts told French that he would share the blame if he collaborated with the Cabinet's [...] "dastardly" [...] attempt to coerce Ulster, and then, after French told him that he would [...] "do his duty as a soldier" [...] and obey lawful orders, put the phone down on him. Soon after, Roberts received a telegram from Hubert Gough, purporting to ask for advice, although possibly designed to goad him into further action. Roberts requested an audience with King George V, who told him that Seely (Secretary of State for War), to whom the King had recently spoken, had complained that Roberts was [...] "at the bottom" [...] of the matter, had incited Gough, and had called the politicians [...] "swine and robbers" [...] in his phone conversation with French. Roberts indignantly denied this, claiming that he had not been in contact with Gough for [...] "years" [...] and that he had advised officers not to resign. Roberts' claim may not be the whole truth as Gough was on first name terms with Roberts' daughter and later gave her copies of key documents relating to the Incident.|$|E
