After they step out on the balcony, the man draws a toothpick {{from his pocket and}} hands it to her with an upwards nod, which she reciprocates. After looking out for another few seconds she clasps his neck lightly and they step back inside.|$|E
5|$|Marge and {{the kids}} wake up to find {{themselves}} back in Springfield, now in ruins (except Springfield Elementary School, much to Bart's chagrin). They find Moe Szyslak, who {{is dressed in a}} <b>bathrobe,</b> a traffic cone and bullets and has become self-proclaimed Emperor of Springfield (although his leadership was unsuccessfully challenged by Barney). Just then, Russ Cargill reappears on the giant screen, and announces to the people of Springfield that placing the dome over Springfield was a mistake, and the government has commenced Operation: Soaring Eagle, an ill-named plan which involves killing them all. A helicopter lowers a small but powerful bomb down a rope {{through a hole in the}} dome. While Homer climbs to the top of the dome, the townspeople attempt to climb the rope to escape through the still-opened hole, but Homer slides down the rope and knocks them off along with the bomb. After reconciling with Bart, Homer drives a motorcycle along the dome, inspired by the earlier carnival attraction. As a passenger of the motorcycle, Bart throws the bomb through the hole; seconds later it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town. Cargill arrives personally and prepares to shoot Homer with a shotgun, but Maggie knocks him unconscious with a boulder. The town finally praises and forgives Homer, who rides into the sun rise with Marge and Maggie, whereupon the townspeople restore Springfield to normal. As a symbol of their gratitude, the Simpsons and their friends begin to rebuild the family's house.|$|E

25|$|LAPD detectives {{investigating}} the case quickly concluded that Rasmussen {{had been killed}} by a burglar. Rasmussen's attire (a <b>bathrobe,</b> nightgown, and panties) suggested she was not expecting visitors. Although a maid in a neighboring unit reported hearing screaming and fighting earlier in the day, she did not recall gunshots. She thought the whole event had been a domestic dispute and did not call police. It appeared that the perpetrator had been in the process of taking electronic equipment when Rasmussen had come upon him or them and, as a result, jewelry had been left behind and the vehicle taken as a getaway. The abandoned BMW was recovered a week later; it yielded no new evidence. The only other thing that appeared to have been taken from the home was the couple's marriage license.|$|E
25|$|Even {{when not}} under indictment, he {{prepared}} for inevitable charges (knowing the FBI was watching him). Almost {{every day he}} would return from his residence to his mother's apartment at 225 Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village and emerge dressed in a <b>bathrobe</b> and pajamas or a windbreaker and shabby trousers. Accompanied by one or two bodyguards, he crossed {{the street to the}} Triangle Civic Improvement Association — a dingy storefront club that served as his headquarters — where he played pinochle and held whispered conversations with his associates. Regular visitors to the Triangle included senior Genovese caporegimes Liborio Bellomo, John Ardito, Tino Fiumara, Ernest Muscarella and Daniel Leo. From Gigante's 1990 indictment and after his incarceration (in La Tuna, Texas) these men ran the crime family, with all major choices authorized by Gigante from his prison cell.|$|E

500|$|... "Wintour's {{approach}} hit a nerve—this {{was the way}} {{real women}} put clothes together (with the likely exception of wearing multi-thousand-dollar T-shirts)," [...] one reviewer says. On the June 1989 cover, another model was shown in wet hair, with just a <b>bathrobe</b> and no apparent makeup. Photographers, makeup artists, and hairstylists got credited along with the models. In August 2014, Gigi Hadid paid tribute to Wintour's first cover.|$|E

The video begins with the man waking up in his apartment at noon. He conducts various experiments to create music, and finally finishes a robotic mannequin that plays the drums. This is interspersed with shots of Miike Snow band members driving a car with Wyatt singing in the backseat. Happy with his invention, the man then walks outside in his <b>bathrobe,</b> headphones and sunglasses past three frolicking teenagers, and hugs one of them.

The video premiered online in September 2009, before being released to the iTunes Store on 9 October 2009. Regarding the video, Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music remarked: [...] "It's basically what Santa does on his days off." ...|$|E
500|$|When Balzac was {{exhibited}} in 1898, the negative reaction was not surprising. The Société rejected the work, {{and the press}} ran parodies. Criticizing the work, Morey (1918) reflected, [...] "there may come a time, and doubtless will come a time, when it will not seem outre to represent a great novelist as a huge comic mask crowning a <b>bathrobe,</b> but even at the present day this statue impresses one as slang." [...] A modern critic, indeed, indicates that Balzac is one of Rodin's masterpieces.|$|E

A man (Jason Schwartzman) lies on a hotel bed in a yellow <b>bathrobe,</b> watching the black-and-white American war film Stalag 17 and reading the newspaper.

She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell her she could come, the man consents nevertheless.

500|$|The show {{began with}} a woman dressed in an 18th-century white nightgown who talked to the {{audience}} briefly before disappearing. There was a video introduction in which different people told their dreams. At {{the end of the}} video, Spears appeared sleeping in a bubble.

She started rotating in a similar way to a target girl while starting to perform [...] "Oops!...I Did It Again" [...] with her dancers. [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] was performed next with Spears captured by her dancers. She left the stage for a costume change while her dancers performed. [...] "Overprotected" [...] was performed next with Spears (dressed in a futuristic version of one of Elvis Presley's jumpsuit) surrounded by laser lights. The video backdrop showed images of a bald Spears, with her hair growing as the song went along. In the next section, a giant musical box was raised, and Spears emerged from the middle as a ballerina to perform [...] "Born To Make You Happy".

2500|$|Wilson spent a {{great deal}} of the two years {{following}} his father's June 1973 death secluded in the chauffeur's quarters of his home; sleeping, abusing alcohol, taking drugs (including heroin), overeating, and exhibiting self-destructive behavior. He attempted to drive his vehicle off a cliff, and at another time, demanded that he be pushed into and buried in a grave he had dug in his backyard. During this period, his voice deteriorated significantly as a result of his mass consumption of cocaine and incessant chain smoking. Previously, Wilson claimed that he was preoccupied with [...] " [...] drugs and hanging out with Danny Hutton" [...] (whose house became the center of Wilson's social life) during the mid-1970s. John Sebastian often showed up at Wilson's Bel Air home [...] "to jam", and recollected: [...] "It wasn't all grimness." [...] Although increasingly reclusive during the day, Wilson spent many nights at Hutton's house fraternizing with Hollywood Vampire colleagues such as Alice Cooper and Iggy Pop, who were mutually bemused by an extended Wilson-led singalong of the folk song [...] "Shortnin' Bread"; other visitors of Hutton's home included Vampires Harry Nilsson, John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and Keith Moon. Micky Dolenz recalls taking LSD with Wilson, Lennon, and Nilsson, where Wilson [...] "played just one note on a piano over and over again". On several occasions, Marilyn Wilson sent her friends to climb Hutton's fence and retrieve her husband. Jimmy Webb reported Wilson's presence at an August 2, 1974 session for Nilsson's [...] "Salmon Falls"; he kept in the back of the studio playing [...] "Da Doo Ron Ron" [...] haphazardly on a B3 organ. Later that month, he was photographed at Moon's 28th birthday party (held on August 28 at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel) wearing only his <b>bathrobe.</b> Sometime in 1974, Wilson interrupted a set by jazz musician Larry Coryell at The Troubadour by leaping onto stage and singing [...] "Be-Bop-A-Lula", again wearing slippers and a <b>bathrobe.</b>|$|E
