40|$|On April 20, 2005, the President of the United States {{signed a}} {{sweeping}} legislative {{overhaul of the}} consumer bankruptcy system. The <b>bankruptcy</b> reform <b>legislation</b> {{is based on an}} empirical assertion: that sophisticated debtors with the means to re-pay their debts were instead filing for bankruptcy and acquiring a discharge, thereby abusing the bankruptcy system. This Article presents the results of an empirical study of bankruptcy court doctrine in consumer exemptions proceedings over a twenty-year period. The findings suggest a serious empirical flaw in the premise of the <b>bankruptcy</b> reform <b>legislation.</b> The study shows that the bankruptcy system minimizes abuse by valuing property exemptions to decrease the amount of the discharge for sophisticated debtors and increase the amount of the discharge for unsophisticated debtors. The data show that the presence of sophistication reduces a debtor’s chance of success in an exemptions proceeding by as much as 87. 8 %. Courts systematically value exemptions to impose costs on the “can-pay” debtor. This pattern of abuse minimization emerged endogenously, without the prompting of hierarchical, exogenous forces such as Congressional or appellate court directives. These findings suggest that Congress has misunderstood the complex nature of the bankruptcy system, misdiagnosed the problem of consumer credit, and applied the wrong remedy. The Article concludes with a preliminary attempt to re-focus analysis of debt regulation around a “no-fault”...|$|R

This paper explores the effects of such a reform in a model where, in contrast to previous work, bankruptcy options and production are explicitly taken into account. Our findings indicate that means testing would not improve upon current bankruptcy provisions and, at best, leaves aggregate filings, output, and welfare unchanged. Put simply,given already existing provisions, the introduction of an efficient means test would not bind. However, we do find that a tightening of existing bankruptcy laws, {{in the form of}} lower Chapter 7 asset exemptions, can be welfare improving.

40|$|This Article {{considers}} the recent {{decline of the}} class action by comparing earlier, parallel developments in the law of business reorganizations. Until the 1930 s, the equity receivership was the procedural device used to reorganize firms in financial distress, because a receivership, like a class action, could achieve a binding group resolution among dispersed claimants. Although initially viewed favorably, the receivership came under sustained attacks from political, academic, and judicial critics. These critics, like today’s critics of the class action, challenged {{the legitimacy of the}} receivership process. In particular, they painted the lawyers in receivership cases as conflicted actors who placed their own interests above the interests of claimants — much as class action lawyers are sometimes portrayed. These criticisms led to <b>bankruptcy</b> reform <b>legislation</b> in the New Deal era that sharply constrained reorganization practice. Yet, the New Deal-era restrictions on reorganization practice were rejected a generation later with the adoption of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Article proposes two explanations for the revival of reorganization law after a generation in decline. First, the practical needs that had driven the development of the receivership as a device for resolving the financial distress of firms did not dissipate simply because that device was hobbled. Instead, lawyers and courts attempted to find other, more cumbersome and inefficient pathways for achieving the same ends. Second, the control and supervision of lawyers was integral to the revival of business reorganization practice. Partly out of concern about actually deterring lawyer misconduct and partly out of concern about addressing the perception of lawyer misconduct, those who worked to revive the bankruptcy system understood the need to include institutions that seek to check excessive influence by lawyers in the process. The Article draws on these developments to suggest possible routes for the future development of the class action and aggregate litigation more generally...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} is concerned with explaining cross-national performance of small business and entrepreneurs in advanced economies.

40|$|Abstract: Many {{commentators}} {{argue that}} uncertainty about taxes, government purchases and other policy matters deepened {{the recession of}} 2007 - 2009 and slowed the recovery. To investigate this issue we develop a new index of policy-related economic uncertainty and estimate its dynamic relationship to output, investment and employment. Our index averages several components that reflect the frequency of news media references to economic policy uncertainty, the number of federal tax code provisions set to expire in future years, {{and the extent of}} forecaster disagreement over future inflation and federal government purchases. The index spikes near consequential presidential elections and after major events such as the Gulf wars and the 9 / 11 attack. Index values are very high in recent years with clear jumps around the Lehman <b>bankruptcy</b> and TARP <b>legislation,</b> the 2010 midterm elections, the Eurozone crisis and the U. S. debt-ceiling dispute. We also construct an index of European economic policy uncertainty mirroring our American news-based index. VAR estimates show that an increase in policy uncertainty equal to the actual change between 2006 and 2011 foreshadows large and persistent declines in aggregate outcomes, with peak declines of 3. 2 % in real GDP, 16 % in private investment and 2. 3 million in aggregate employment...|$|R

5000|$|In {{response}} to mismanagement of the city's finances, Congress abolished the mayor-council form of city government in 1871. The new District of Columbia Organic Act abolished the city charters of the City of Washington, Georgetown, and the County of Washington, and merged {{them into a}} single territorial government. The office of governor was created, {{as well as an}} 11-member council, a locally elected 22-member assembly, and a board of public works. On March 16, 1871, Alexander Robey Shepherd was appointed vice chair of the Board of Public Works. Governor Henry D. Cooke rarely attended board of public works meetings, allowing Shepherd to dominate the body's deliberations. Shepherd rapidly spend millions of dollars improving the city's infrastructure. Shepherd's business sold street lights, and thus it was no surprise that his infrastructure improvements involved extending street lighting throughout the city. Shepherd was appointed governor on September 13, 1873. His tenure, however, was brief. Spending on his improvements, estimated at a then-staggering $6.5 million, rose to $9 million.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of {{personal}} costs of bankruptcy for CEOs in Norway. If these costs are substantial, they can incentivize CEOs to hedge against bankruptcy. The practical implications can be severe for the firms’ different stakeholders. We study a sample of 1, 446 CEOs in 1, 023 Norwegian firms declared bankrupt between 2009 and 2013. The thesis comprises four main analyses examining personal costs in various forms: First, CEO replacement incurs a personal cost in terms of reputational damage. As such, we analyze determinants of CEOs´ replacements prior to bankruptcy. Second, those not attaining a new CEO position after bankruptcy suffer costs in terms of lower status. Therefore, we address the employment changes for our sample CEOs. Third, we address the compensation loss imposed on the CEOs prior to bankruptcy. Fourth, we investigate compensation loss for CEOs that occurs after the bankruptcy. These analyses are intended to give a profound understanding of how CEOs in Norway are affected by bankruptcy. We argue that the sum of CEOs´ personal costs of bankruptcy in Norway are sparse. Consequently, we find {{no evidence to support}} the existence of CEO hedging behavior in Norway. Compared with previous research, we find a relatively small share of CEOs being replaced prior to bankruptcy (14 % annually). Further, we observe a marginal reduction of NOK 50 thousand in compensation prior to bankruptcy. In addition, we find a compensation loss after bankruptcy for those not finding new employment as CEOs, but it only amounts to NOK 536 thousand over their lifetime. However, we find that only a relatively small fraction of our sample attains a new CEO position after bankruptcy (20 %). This thesis complements other research in Sweden and the U. S. on the same issue. Notably, it is the first examination of Norwegian <b>bankruptcies</b> (and <b>legislation).</b> Under Norwegian legislation, all bankrupt companies cease to exist. In both Sweden and the U. S. however, firms can continue as a going-concern and sustain their business. Moreover, most larger restructurings in Norway are settled in out-of-court negotiations and not registered, resulting in a sample mostly consisting of small firms. These distinctions can also explain differences in results between our study and previous research...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} using legal {{structures}} to protect property {{from those who}} might otherwise have some claim to it is an idea with deep roots. The trust device is one such legal structure, and its evolution as an asset protection device has not been without controversy. The recent and noticeable break with the traditional denial of self-settled trust protections is one such area of modern controversy, but not the only notable recent development. The self-setted asset protection trust movement is accompanied by the recent completion of two major law reform projects. The drafting and recommendation for state adoption of a Uniform Trust Code is one such project. The Restatement (Third) of Trusts is the second. Taken together, these developments have recently affected and will undoubtedly continue to influence the evolution of trust asset protection. This article considers these developments and their potential impact on the future course of trust asset protection. Among the observations presented {{is the idea that}} the UTC holds a significant place in the development of trust asset protection - not so much because of the conclusions its drafters reached as to particular rules, but more because of the express invitation the UTC presents to state legislatures to ponder their own trust protections and corresponding placement in the modern asset protection community. Finally, this article provides insights into both the current and evolving status of trust asset protection by relating the noted reform projects to several trust protection developments seen in the last decade or so. That exploration proceeds from a recognition of interest group politics as related to the UTC movement. The discussion progresses to an evaluation of potential ideological influences on the future course of trust asset protections. Along the way, consideration is given to the federal influences on that course. Those influences are at least in part derived from the potential repeal of estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes, recent <b>bankruptcy</b> reform <b>legislation,</b> and the status of the federal/state Medicaid program. Among the observations presented is the idea that these ideological and federal concerns push in multiple directions, often {{at the same time and}} in a conflicting manner, with a very uncertain but potentially significant effect on the future evolution of trust asset protection...|$|R
