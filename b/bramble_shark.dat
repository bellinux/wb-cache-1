5|$|The <b>bramble</b> <b>shark</b> is {{not known}} to pose a danger to humans. It is caught {{incidentally}} by commercial fisheries in bottom trawls and on fishing line, {{as well as by}} sport anglers. In the eastern Atlantic, this species is processed into fishmeal but has little commercial significance. Its liver oil is highly valued in South Africa as medicine, whereas in India the oil is considered poor and is used to coat canoes to discourage woodboring beetles. Historical accounts suggest that <b>bramble</b> <b>shark</b> numbers in the northeastern Atlantic have fallen markedly since the 18th and 19th centuries, such as that it is now extremely rare off northern Europe and in the Mediterranean. This decline has been attributed to fishing pressure, to which this species may be highly vulnerable as large, deep-sea sharks generally have slow growth rates and long lifespans. Regarding the species as a whole, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks sufficient data for an assessment beyond Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|Records of the <b>bramble</b> <b>shark</b> {{are fairly}} rare and {{originate}} from widely scattered locations in tropical and temperate waters worldwide, {{save for the}} eastern Pacific Ocean. Most {{have come from the}} eastern Atlantic and western Indian Oceans, where its range extends from the North Sea and the British Isles to southern Mozambique, including the Mediterranean Sea. In the western Atlantic, this species is represented by a handful of specimens from Massachusetts, North Carolina, Louisiana, Tobago, Brazil, and Argentina. In the Indo-Pacific, it is known from Oman, India, southern Japan, southern Australia, New Zealand, and possibly Kiribati.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bramble</b> <b>shark</b> has a thick, {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} somewhat flattened head. The snout is blunt and shorter than {{the width of the}} mouth, with widely spaced nostrils that are preceded by small flaps of skin. The eyes lack nictitating membranes; the tiny spiracles are located well behind them. The wide, curved mouth bears very short furrows at the corners. There are 20–26 upper and 22–26 lower tooth rows; each tooth is knife-like, with a single main cusp and up to three cusplets on either side. There are five pairs of gill slits, with the fifth pair the longest.|$|E

5|$|The diet of the <b>bramble</b> <b>shark</b> {{includes}} smaller sharks, bony fishes, and crabs, {{which this}} slow-moving species may capture via suction. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing litters of 15–52 pups.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. However, its population has declined substantially in the northeastern Atlantic since the 18th and 19th centuries, likely because of overfishing.|$|E
