25|$|Future MBT (FMBT) was {{originally}} a new tank design {{that was to}} be developed from scratch for induction in 2025 and beyond. The FMBT and the programme would have focused on weight reduction in the design and was to be a lighter tank of 50 tons,. However, the idea was dropped as no major <b>breakthrough</b> <b>technology</b> was realised in tank design that needed a complete design from scratch. As such it was decided to take the Arjun Mk II and upgrade the tank with new upgrades (suggested and followed by Israel's Merkava tanks). Future tanks are expected {{to be based on the}} Arjun and will incorporate new technologies just as most other tanks.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBreakthrough {{technologies}} are technologies that introduce radically new capabilities or a performance increase {{of at least}} an order of magnitude. Examples are the turbojet, inertial navigation, and autonomous driving. However, a remarkable pattern for these technologies is that their feasibility {{seems to have been}} initially contested. Existing approaches for technology assessment such as the Technology Readiness Levels {{do not seem to be}} adequate for capturing the subtle dimension of assessing the potential of <b>breakthrough</b> <b>technologies,</b> as they rather focus on technological maturity. Important aspects such as performance, enabling systems, and contextual factors are not taken into account. This paper addresses the principle feasibility of <b>breakthrough</b> <b>technologies</b> by looking at what arguments for and against principle feasibility were/are used and how the feasibility question was resolved. For this purpose, we reconstruct past and ongoing principle feasibility debates of four exemplary <b>breakthrough</b> <b>technologies</b> using a technology conceptual model and argument maps. For the four technologies analysed, we conclude that sufficient expected performance was a key issue debated in all cases, whereas physical effects and working principles were issues for <b>breakthrough</b> <b>technologies</b> with a relatively low maturity. Principle feasibility issues for <b>breakthrough</b> <b>technologies</b> seem to be resolved by introducing new component technologies and working principles. For future work, we propose the use of case and field studies in order to explore contextual feasibility criteria for <b>breakthrough</b> <b>technologies</b> such as injection into existing system architectures, enabling systems, and market readiness...|$|R

2500|$|Two {{weeks after}} the album's debut, A 3D music video was {{released}} for the title track, [...] "MaFi Noum," [...] becoming the first 3D Music Clip in the Middle East. The music video was produced by two professional teams from the US and the UK {{in collaboration with the}} Lebanese W Production Group; this required extensive research of 3D techniques as to familiarize the Middle East crew with the <b>breakthrough</b> <b>technology,</b> including the handling of sophisticated 3D equipment and digital cameras that were used for the shoot. Directed by Waleed Nassif, the video was created by Sony, and produced by Rotana. The opening sequence of the video features Season 1 Arabs' Got Talent contestant, Abdelmalek Al Baljani, from Morocco, in a break dance solo. During his appearance on Arab's Got Talent, Najwa was impressed by Al Baljani's abilities and promised on Live TV to cast him in her next video. The three-day shoot took place in Northern Lebanon, at Nahr Ibrahim, in the Kesserwan area of Basateen Al Ossi, Jeita Grotto, and at the studio of Mansourieh. The 3D music video premiered at the ABC Achrafieh theatre in Lebanon on July 25th 2011 and was played in 600 3D Sony showrooms and outlets, throughout the Arab world. A 2D version was also released for Television and Youtube. The [...] "MaFi Noum" [...] 3D clip had one of the largest production budgets in the Middle East.|$|E

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding the {{evolution}} and emergence of technology domains remains a challenge, particularly so for potentially <b>breakthrough</b> <b>technologies.</b> Though {{it is well}} recognized that emergence of new fields is complex and uncertain, to make decisions amidst such uncertainty, one needs to mobilize various sources of intelligence to identify known–knowns and known–unknowns {{to be able to}} choose appropriate strategies and policies. This competitive technical intelligence cannot rely on simple trend analyses because <b>breakthrough</b> <b>technologies</b> have little past to inform such trends, and positing the directions of evolution is challenging. Neither do qualitative tools, embracing the complexities, provide all the solutions, since transparent and repeatable techniques need to be employed to create best practices and evaluate the intelligence that comes from such exercises. In this paper, we present a hybrid roadmapping technique that draws on a number of approaches and integrates them into a multi-level approach (individual activities, industry evolutions and broader global changes) that can be applied to <b>breakthrough</b> <b>technologies.</b> We describe this approach in deeper detail through a case study on dye-sensitized solar cells. Our contribution to this special issue is to showcase the technique as part of a family of approaches that are emerging around the world to inform strategy and policy...|$|R
