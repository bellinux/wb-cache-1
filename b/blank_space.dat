5|$|The {{book had}} a sacramental rather than {{educational}} purpose. Such a large, lavish Gospel {{would have been}} left on the high altar {{of the church and}} removed only for the reading of the Gospel during Mass, with the reader probably reciting from memory more than reading the text. It is significant that the Chronicles of Ulster state the book was stolen from the sacristy, where the vessels and other accoutrements of the Mass were stored, rather than from the monastic library. Its design seems to take this purpose in mind; that is, the book was produced with appearance taking precedence over practicality. There are numerous uncorrected mistakes in the text. Lines were often completed in a <b>blank</b> <b>space</b> in the line above. The chapter headings that were necessary to make the canon tables usable were not inserted into the margins of the page. In general, nothing was done to disrupt the look of the page: aesthetics were given priority over utility.|$|E

25|$|A hybrid marker, {{also known}} as a {{referencing}} exit marker or REM, is a more recently developed line marker used as a directional marker by the diver placing it, and seen as a cookie by others. They are rectangular with slots like the arrow and cookie forms for attachment to a line, and have a relatively large <b>blank</b> <b>space</b> on one end to add identification on one side and to write on the other side. Referencing exit markers are asymmetrical so can be used to show the direction which the diver came from.

2500|$|Lingnan {{school of}} {{painting}} (Jyutping: Ling5 naam5 waa2 paai3; Traditional Chinese: 嶺南畫派), also called Cantonese school of painting, is a distinctive style of painting invented primarily by Cantonese artists. It originated in 19th century, founded by Gou Gim-fu (a Cantonese) {{and several of}} his associates. This style combined the ink wash painting shared by all Han Chinese and watercolor painting, also with the influence from impressionism. It emphasizes leaving <b>blank</b> <b>spaces</b> and the use of bright colors, in stark contrast to less colorful ink wash painting. For example, [...] "The Flames of the Eastern Battlefield" [...] used watercolor to paint bright red colors in the background. This, alongside the <b>blank</b> <b>spaces</b> in the painting, gives potential alternative interpretations of the <b>blank</b> <b>spaces,</b> which could look like either smoke or clouds.|$|R

Hamdani's mother, Talat, has campaigned for the Memorial to acknowledge her son as a police cadet and first responder.

25|$|Meanwhile, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that the club would fold, but a threadbare United team completed the 1957–58 season, with Busby's assistant Jimmy Murphy standing in as manager; he had not travelled to Belgrade {{as he was in}} Cardiff managing the Welsh national team at the time. A team largely made up of reserve and youth team players beat Sheffield Wednesday 3–0 in the first match after the disaster. The programme for that match showed simply a <b>blank</b> <b>space</b> where each United player's name should have been. With seven players dead (Duncan Edwards died just over 24 hours later), and with only Harry Gregg and Bill Foulkes fit to play out of the surviving players, United were desperate to find replacements with experience, so Murphy signed Ernie Taylor from Blackpool and Stan Crowther from Aston Villa. Three players, Derek Lewin, Bob Hardisty and Warren Bradley, were transferred to United on short-term contracts by non-League club Bishop Auckland. Bradley {{was the only one of}} the three players to play for the first team, and the only one to sign a permanent contract. The remaining places in the team were filled by reserve players including Shay Brennan and Mark Pearson.|$|E

500|$|The Canadian Arctic Expedition was {{the brainchild}} of Vilhjalmur Stefansson, a US-based, Canadian-born {{anthropologist}} of Icelandic extraction who had spent most of the years between 1906 and 1912 studying Inuit life in the remote Arctic Canada. His fieldwork had resulted in the first detailed information on the life and culture of the Copper Inuit, the so-called [...] "blond Eskimos". Stefansson had returned home with plans for another expedition to continue his Arctic studies, and obtained promises of financial backing totalling US$45,000 (around US$750,000 in 2010) from the National Geographic Society (NGS) in Washington and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. However, he wanted to extend his plans to include geographical exploration in the Beaufort Sea, then a <b>blank</b> <b>space</b> on the world's maps.

500|$|Another stanza {{appears to}} be part of the {{separate}} cycle of poems associated with Llywarch Hen. The third interpolation is a poem entitled [...] "Dinogad's Smock", a cradle-song addressed to a baby named Dinogad, describing how his father goes hunting and fishing. The interpolations are thought to have been added to the poem after it had been written down, these stanzas first being written down where there was a space in the manuscript, then being incorporated in the poem by a later copier who failed to realise that they did not belong. The Strathcarron stanza, for example, is the first stanza in the B text of the Book of Aneirin, and Jackson suggested that it had probably been inserted on a <b>blank</b> <b>space</b> at the top of the first page of the original manuscript. According to Koch's reconstruction, this stanza was deliberately added to the text in Strathclyde.|$|E
