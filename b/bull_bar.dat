25|$|The FJ Crawler {{was first}} offered in 2007 (for the 2008 model year) {{and is the}} result of a {{collaboration}} between Dealer Services International (DSI), known for building high quality custom packages for new vehicle dealers, and ARB, who has a long history building rugged off-road products. For participating Toyota new vehicle dealerships, the FJ Crawler could be special ordered for customers who were looking for a vehicle that is even more rugged and off-road ready than a standard Off-Road Package factory option would provide. The FJ Crawler package included an ARB Front <b>Bull</b> <b>Bar</b> Bumper, an Old Man Emu 3-inch suspension lift to support the added weight of the ARB bumper and to allow for the 17-inch Pro Comp wheels with either 33 or 35-inch off-roading tires. The FJ Crawler was able to be customized in many ways with many optional accessories to achieve the customers satisfaction. For example, the FJ Crawler could be ordered in any factory color for the current model year. The customer could choose from 3 different wheel choices, 3 different tire choices, and could even choose the exact springs and shocks used in the Old Man Emu suspension to achieve the desired ride/performance quality. There was also the option of adding accessories such as a Warn winch, IFP driving lights which would be mounted to the ARB bumper, a fog light kit for the ARB bumper, and an ARB roof rack for storing gear and other items. Other options included a cat-back exhaust system, a high flow intake, as well as side steps. Also, because of variances in aftermarket tire sizes, speedometer calibration was provided to ensure correct vehicle speed and mileage are recorded.|$|E

50|$|When {{an outside}} bar {{appears in a}} retrace of a strong trend, rather than acting as a range bar, it does show strong {{trending}} tendencies. For instance, a bear outside bar in the retrace of a bull trend is a good signal that the retrace will continue further. This is explained {{by the way the}} outside bar forms, since it begins building in real time as a potential <b>bull</b> <b>bar</b> that is extending above the previous bar, which would encourage many traders to enter a bullish trade to profit from a continuation of the old bull trend. When the market reverses and the potential for a <b>bull</b> <b>bar</b> disappears, it leaves the bullish traders trapped in a bad trade.|$|E

50|$|Some armored cars {{in certain}} {{countries}} may be cleared to have flashing warning lights or sirens. Most armored cars have a <b>bull</b> <b>bar</b> or extra strong bumper to ram blockades or other road objects if under attack. They normally have CCTV cameras which are watched by the driver, {{recorded in the}} van and also recorded at a remotely located control room in case the in-van recordings are stolen by thieves or attackers.|$|E

50|$|Effectively outlawing {{traditional}} metal fabricated <b>bull</b> <b>bars,</b> the {{new legislation}} {{has led to the}} development of more pedestrian-friendly products. Various manufacturers have undertaken development using softer, energy absorbing materials. However the overhead of testing has prevented many designs from coming to market.|$|R
50|$|After public {{concerns}} {{about the safety of}} <b>bull</b> <b>bars</b> led to governmental pressure on SUV and 4x4 vehicle manufacturers, the Transport Research Laboratory developed a series of tests designed to ensure that minimum safety standards are met on vehicles fitted with them. This test has now become embodied within European Directive 2005/66/EC, coming into force in May 2007.|$|R
50|$|Operators {{may also}} make {{decisions}} on a particular bus type or components based on the particular terrain operated in. Some hillier areas may select different powertrain options. Areas with many low-bridges may have more single deckers than double deckers. Operators in humid climates may select air-conditioning as standard. A particular difficulty with double-deckers is trees striking the kerb-side top front corner. Manufacturers, or operators - post delivery, may fit a <b>bull</b> <b>bar</b> type arrangement to protect {{this part of the}} bodywork.|$|E
5000|$|Specialized bumpers, {{known as}} [...] "bull bars" [...] or [...] "roo bars", protect {{vehicles}} in rural environments from collisions with large animals. However, {{studies have shown}} that such bars increase the threat of death and serious injury to pedestrians in urban environments, because the <b>bull</b> <b>bar</b> is rigid and transmits all force of a collision to the pedestrian, unlike a bumper which absorbs some force and crumples. In the European Union, the sale of rigid metal bull bars which do not comply with the relevant pedestrian-protection safety standards has been banned.|$|E
50|$|The {{camera is}} always {{accompanied}} by a white station wagon or by a black or, more commonly a white, silver or brown Nissan X-Trail, staffed by an un-sworn police officer (not a contractor) {{who is responsible for}} assembling and dissembling the unit, supervising it and operating the accompanying laptop in the car for the few hours that it is deployed at a location. The Nissan X-Trail usually has a <b>bull</b> <b>bar</b> and spotlights on it and a large, thick antenna. The camera stays usually for about 4 to 5 hours. There are currently 25 in circulation in Perth.|$|E
50|$|A more {{commercial}} {{application of}} the nerf bar is for convenience purposes on a pickup truck or sport utility vehicle. It may act as a step to ease entry and exit from the vehicle, or to help prevent damage to the vehicle when crossing rocks off-road.

5000|$|Stockmen {{traditionally}} ride horses, use working {{dogs and}} a stockwhip for stock work and mustering, but motorised vehicles are increasingly used. Sometimes the vehicles {{that are used}} are four-wheel drive (4WD) [...] "paddock-bashers", which are often old unregistered utilities. These vehicles may also be modified by removing the top and fitting roll and <b>bull</b> <b>bars</b> for <b>bull</b> or buffalo catching.|$|R

A small selection of optional extras were available such as six-spoked aluminium wheels, <b>bull</b> <b>bars,</b> roof rails and privacy glass. The functional interior design included cup holders, quarter pockets, and split rear seats which fold completely flat providing a surprisingly large carrying capacity for such a small vehicle.|$|R
50|$|At an October 1983 {{court hearing}} a police video taken on 18 August 1983 {{was shown to}} the court. It showed {{the bodies of the}} four people killed {{instantly}} - two men and two women - in the makeshift mortuary set up {{at the back of the}} motel. It also showed the damage to the bar area of the motel, with clothes and boots embedded in the ground under the truck and near its bloodstained <b>bull</b> <b>bar,</b> from which the officer who took the video said many of the dead had been pulled. Crabbe, charged with five counts of murder at the hearing, sat expressionless as the video was shown.|$|E

The car is blue from the Blue Marlin fish {{and they have the}} Blue Marlin logo throughout the car. Some of the features that the Blue Marlin included were altimeters, power windows, disk brakes, leather gear knob and steering wheel, central locking, leather trim, chrome handles and sidesteps, 16" [...] alloy wheels, limited-slip differential, anti-lock brakes (ABS), power steering, CD and cassette players, flares, and a limited edition <b>bull</b> <b>bar.</b> Only 500 were made.|$|E
5000|$|A bullbar or push bumper (also roo bar or {{nudge bar}} in Australia, moose bumper in Canada, and push bar, <b>bull</b> <b>bar,</b> brush guard, grill guard or cattle pusher in the United States) is a device {{installed}} {{on the front of}} a vehicle to protect its front from collisions, whether an accidental collision with a large animal in rural roads, or an intentional collision with another vehicle in police usage. They range considerably in size and form, and are normally composed of welded steel or aluminium tubing, or, more recently, moulded polycarbonate and polyethylene materials. The [...] "bull" [...] in the name refers to cattle, which in rural areas sometimes roam onto rural roads and highways.|$|E
50|$|Ute musters {{are often}} mis-represented as being {{attended}} by yobbos who {{just like to}} drink, {{this is no longer}} the case, but instead an outlet for enthusiastic ute owners to show off their pride and joy in their vehicles which are personalised with lights, stickers, <b>bull</b> <b>bars,</b> and various after-market add-ons. They are generally held to raise money for towns, charities and local causes, and have run in conjunction with agricultural shows or Bachelor and Spinster Balls which raise money for local charities.|$|R
50|$|Testing in 2001 {{showed that}} steel <b>bull</b> <b>bars</b> {{could lead to}} greater risk of injury. Later studies carried out by MIRA, one of the UK's leading testing-facilities, may have proved that the latest {{development}} of a vehicle Frontal Protection System can make many 4x4 vehicles safer {{in the event of}} front-end collisions with pedestrians or cyclists. Calculations based on these tests show that if fitted to a current large 4x4 vehicle, an FPS could save lives and reduce serious pedestrian-injuries.|$|R
50|$|Off-road {{vehicles}} often utilize aftermarket off-road bumpers made {{of heavy}} gauge metal {{to improve the}} road clearance, maximize departure angles, clear larger tires and ensure additional protection from the elements. The same as <b>bull</b> <b>bars</b> off-road bumpers feature a rigid construction and transmit all force of a collision to the object that they bump on, which is more dangerous for pedestrians than factory plastic bumpers. The legality of the aftermarket off-road bumpers varies significantly {{from country to country}} (from state to state in the USA).|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{changes were made}} by Nine for the 3rd series. Of the {{original}} hosts from SBS, only Steve Pizzati made the move, with new hosts Shane Jacobson & Ewen Page (editor-in-chief of Top Gear Australia magazine) replacing Warren Brown & James Morrison. while former Australian cricketer Shane Warne was added as an occasional guest reviewer. The test track at Camden Airport was redesigned and the 'Star Car' was replaced. The Proton Satria Neo used in the first 2 series on SBS made way for a more 'Australian' Ford XF Falcon Ute complete with <b>bull</b> <b>bar,</b> UHF CB aerial and stickers. (Nine also changed {{the name of the}} celebrity car challenge from 'Star In A Bog-Standard Car' to 'Star In A Car').|$|E

50|$|The European and British {{versions}} {{were installed}} with standard headlight washers and rear fog lights, so that other drivers {{could see them}} in inclement weather and at night. European models also received glass-lens halogen headlights that could have the distance the light was projected adjusted from an electric switch installed on the dashboard, and also received speed sensitive, variable effort power steering, and both items were standard installed. The Australian-spec sedan and wagon were equipped with the rear fog light, but not the headlight washers. The British and Europeans could also install a front bumper <b>bull</b> <b>bar</b> and an 8 mm thick steel sump guard that extended from the bottom edge of the front bumper to the front suspension. The Europeans could not get an in-dash cupholder located in the small space below the HVAC controls and above the stereo, found in the Australian, USA and Japanese models. In that location instead is a clock, and a button to deploy an electric radio antenna, if so equipped. Clocks are integrated with the OEM stereo internationally.|$|E

5000|$|Studies {{have shown}} that using bull bars {{increases}} the risk of death and serious injury to pedestrians. This is because the <b>bull</b> <b>bar</b> is rigid, and so transmits all the force to the pedestrian, unlike a bumper which resists some force and crumples. Due to the number of deaths and injuries caused by the rigid fronts of cars, often with metal bullbars (2,000 deaths and 18,000 serious accidents per year in Europe, according to official studies in the UK), the sale of new metal bullbars which did not comply with the European Union Directive was banned. However, in the United Kingdom the sale and refitting of second-hand bars manufactured before 2007 or the use of pre-2007 bars already fitted is permitted as per the current MOT guidelines: [...] "It is not illegal for vehicles to be fitted with bull bars, although the Department would not recommend their fitment unless it has been shown, through compliance with specified safety standards, that they do not pose an additional risk of injury to pedestrians or other vulnerable road users. There are no plans for legislation to require bull bars that are already fitted to be removed." ...|$|E
