25|$|Coastal fishing {{villages are}} often {{somewhat}} isolated, and sited around a small natural harbour which provides {{safe haven for}} a village fleet of fishing boats. The village needs to provide a safe way of landing fish and securing boats {{when they are not}} in use. Fishing villages may operate from a beach, particularly around lakes. For example, around parts of Lake Malawi, each fishing village has its own <b>beach.</b> If a <b>fisherman</b> from outside the village lands fish on the beach, he gives some of the fish to the village headman. Village fishing boats are usually characteristic of the stretch of coast along which they operate. Traditional fishing boats evolve over time to meet the local conditions, such as the materials available locally for boat building, the type of sea conditions the boats will encounter, and the demands of the local fisheries.|$|R
