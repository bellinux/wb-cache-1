5|$|Lewis and Audrey {{decide to}} go on holiday {{together}} and Lewis offers to pay for himself. Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly wrote that Lewis' renewed relationship with Audrey and their plans {{to go on a}} round-the-world cruise would cause a feud between her and David. Audrey's money is tied up in the salon, so she asks David to sign it back to her so she can pay for the holiday. However, David refuses to sign the salon <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> thinks Lewis might be planning another fraud. Kilkelly said Lewis tries to play peacemaker and suggests postponing the trip until he can save the money himself, but Audrey insists David will co-operate and she tears up their contract.|$|E

60|$|The men needed {{not to be}} urged; {{they were}} quite as anxious as their {{commander}} to win the races and bent their <b>backs,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> expressed it, until the oars seemed about to break. Glynn sat on the after thwart, and did good service on this occasion.|$|R

5|$|Leaving the building, Jeff finds all {{the pages}} in the {{envelope}} to be blank. He returns {{to the office of}} Dr. Duncan who tells him that he wanted to teach him a lesson although Jeff gets his car keys <b>back.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> is about to leave campus, Jeff runs into Pierce and Troy, and shows his ability to make people feel better about themselves through advice and encouragement. The others join, and Jeff admits to being a fraud. He says that he does not have the test answers, and that he will probably flunk next day's test. The group has now taken a liking to him, and they invite him back in. The episode ends with a dedication to the recently deceased John Hughes, whose film The Breakfast Club had been repeatedly referenced throughout the episode.|$|E
5|$|The seventh {{match was}} a {{standard}} match between Shawn Michaels and Chris Masters. The match started with Masters applying the Masterlock on Michaels. After breaking the hold, Michaels delivered a clothesline and knife edged chops. Masters, however, dominated Michaels, focusing {{on his back}} by powerbombing Michaels several times. He also lifted Michaels vertically {{in the air and}} stalled him there before slamming him down. Michaels fought <b>back,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> delivered a Diving Elbow Drop. Masters was able to lock in the Masterlock once more. Michaels tried to use the corners to break the hold, but Masters kept it locked on. Michaels then leaped over the top rope and landed on the ring apron, causing the referee to order Masters to break the hold. Michaels countered with a Sweet Chin Music, thus Michaels got the pinfall victory over Masters.|$|E
5|$|Vincent begins {{creating}} {{the painting of}} the church and soon spots the beast inside. The Doctor demands that Amy stay <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> enters the church alone, but she and Vincent both agree they should help the Doctor. Vincent is able to save the Doctor and Amy, describing the beast's actions as they hide in the confessionals. The Doctor soon realises from Vincent's description that the beast is blind, the likely reason it was abandoned on Earth, and is frightened of its surroundings. The beast is impaled on Vincent's easel when it tries to lunge at the artist. The Doctor attempts to soothe the dying creature while Vincent empathises with its pain. After the creature dies, the three return outside the church and Vincent describes the night sky as he envisions it.|$|E
50|$|As {{hosts of}} the 1966 World Cup, England {{did not have}} to partake in a {{rigorous}} qualifying campaign, and Ramsey experimented with other left <b>backs</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> shaped a squad for the tournament. As it neared, Wilson achieved some domestic success when Everton won the FA Cup at Wembley.|$|R

25|$|Sir Alan warned Ruth {{that she}} had made a mistake by not {{bringing}} Ansell <b>back,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had felt he was most at fault for the loss, but decided to spare her since most had agreed she had been a very good project manager, and it was noted that Velocity would have easily defeated Invicta had their campaign been targeted correctly.|$|E

25|$|Ambrose made a Nationwide Series {{return at}} the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course's Nationwide Children's Hospital 200.

He rallied to finish in 7th place but was spun out by Parker Kligerman after the checkered flag for previous contact during the race.|$|E
25|$|Inconstant {{returned}} to England in July that year, sailing again in November bound for Toulon to join Samuel Hood's fleet. She was briefly commanded by Captain George Cockburn in 1794, {{but he was}} succeeded by Thomas Fremantle in January 1795. Under Fremantle, {{and as part of}} the fleet under Admiral William Hotham, she fought against the 80-gun Ça Ira on 10 March 1795. The Ça Ira’s massive superiority in firepower soon forced Fremantle to fall <b>back.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> did so, HMS Agamemnon, commanded by Captain Horatio Nelson, surged past to continue the fight. This was a prelude to the Naval Battle of Genoa, fought over the next few days.|$|E
60|$|The {{older man}} shrank <b>back</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> had been struck. He stared. His lower jaw dropped. A dark flush reddened his cheek.|$|R
60|$|Beam. You bore {{yourself}} in {{that as it}} became you, as one who was a witness to himself of his own courage; and while, by necessary care of others, you were forced to decline fighting, shewed how much you did despise the man who sought the quarrel: 'Twas base in him, so <b>backed</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is here, to offer it, much more to press you to it.|$|R

25|$|Later, in October, one of Insolents boats hit a rock, {{with the}} result that her captain and three seamen drowned. The purser's {{daughter}} was on the boat and one of the seaman swam for the shore, carrying her on his <b>back.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> swam her clothes became sodden and he informed the young woman that unless she agreed to let him remove her clothes he could not carry her further. She refused, stating that she preferred to die than compromise her virtue. He swam on for a bit with her, still clothed, on his back, but eventually, exhausted, he had to let her go and watch her drown.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 offseason, the A's traded {{promising}} young star OF Carlos González, closer Huston Street and starting pitcher Greg Smith for Matt Holliday of the Colorado Rockies. On January 6, 2009, Jason Giambi signed a one-year, $4.6 {{million contract with}} a 2nd year option. Giambi said {{he was glad to}} be <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> put on his old number 16. Also signed were infielders Orlando Cabrera of the Chicago White Sox and Nomar Garciaparra of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The first half of the season the team played relatively poor, but finished the second half strong, yet still posting a losing record. Holliday was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals for prospects and Giambi was released in August after spending time on the DL.|$|E
25|$|Around {{this time}} her son Kwame was very ill. The {{following}} month, Queen Elizabeth II made her {{first visit to}} Ghana. While inspecting the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and President Nkrumah passed by the boy's bed. Since he {{had a picture of}} his parents displayed on his bedside table, the Duke of Edinburgh, who had visited Kumasi previously and had met Peggy Appiah, turned <b>back,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was leaving, to send his regards. President Nkrumah's reported anger at being embarrassed in this way -this was the husband of a foreign head of state sending a greeting to the wife of a man Nkrumah had in political detention – was reportedly {{one of the reasons that}} Kwame Appiah's doctor was deported.|$|E

25|$|The Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories (AMGOT) {{used the}} {{remnants}} of the previous fascist government, especially the Polizia and Carabinieri, to suppress the black market. Since their pay was irregular and most of their income was bribes from major black marketeers, they focused their attention on minor operators. On 2 September 1943, Giuliano was caught at a Carabinieri check point transporting two sacks of black market grain. While trying to negotiate his release in return for surrendering the grain, Giuliano drew his gun when another black marketeer was apprehended. When one of the officers raised his weapon, Giuliano shot and killed him. He was shot in the <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> fled. After the escape and an operation arranged by his family, he hid out in the family home.|$|E
25|$|The Grand Dukes {{were loaded}} into a truck that already held four common criminals and six Red Guardsmen. At 1:20 am on 28 January, {{they left the}} prison. They drove towards the river by the Field of Mars, where the truck stalled. While the driver was trying to restart it, one of the convicts tried to run and {{was shot in the}} <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> fled. The truck {{eventually}} began running again, and they drove to the Peter and Paul Fortress. The prisoners were roughly pushed from the truck into the Trubetskoy bastion. They were told to remove their shirts and coats, {{despite the fact that it}} was almost 20 degrees below zero. By then they had no doubt what was about to occur and the Grand Dukes embraced each other for the last time.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} week in Ireland Essex mounted a lavish pageant of English chivalry during the Garter Feast at Dublin on St George's Day, April 23. It was a pointed display of the values he felt were ignored at Elizabeth's Court. In London the Queen had chosen a muted {{version of the same}} ceremony, owing to the hardships of the war, and on hearing the reports from Dublin she granted the {{valuable}} mastership of wards to Cecil rather than the Earl. There was more humiliation for Essex when he rode north to Drogheda to inspect the famous 1,200 strong Flanders regiment, now commanded by Arthur Chichester. Essex charged the parading troops with his mounted staff, but they chose not to see the joke and stood firm, forcing him to pull his horse <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was pricked in the backside with a pike.|$|E
