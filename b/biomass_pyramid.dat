40|$|Although the {{existence}} of robust inverted <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramids</b> seem paradoxical, they have been observed in planktonic communities, and more recently, in pristine coral reefs. Understanding the underlying mechanisms which produce inverted <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramids</b> provides new ecological insights, and for coral reefs, may help mitigate or restore damaged reefs. We present three classes of predator-prey models which elucidate mechanisms that generate robust inverted <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramids.</b> The first class of models exploits well-mixing of predators and prey, the second class has a refuge (with explicit size) for the prey to hide, and the third class incorporates the immigration of prey. Our models indicate that inverted <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramids</b> occur when the prey growth rate, prey carrying capacity, biomass conversion efficiency, the predator life span, or the immigration rate of prey fish is sufficiently large. In the second class, we discuss three hypotheses on how refuge size can impact the amount of prey available to predators. By explicitly incorporating a refuge size, these can more realistically model predator-prey interactions than refgue models with implicit refuge size. Comment: 24 page, 2 figure...|$|R
50|$|One {{problem with}} <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramids</b> {{is that they}} can make a trophic level appear to contain more energy than it {{actually}} does. For example, all birds have beaks and skeletons, which despite having mass are not typically digested by the next trophic level.|$|R
40|$|What would reef fish {{communities}} {{look like}} without humans? Effective ecosystem management and con- servation requires {{a clear understanding}} of community structure and the processes that drive it. Relatively undisturbed reef fish communities appear to be inverted <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramids</b> (IBPs) with greater biomass of large-bodied predatory fishes compared to smaller fishes at lower trophic-levels. However, the processes that might give rise to IBPs are subject to debate. In this thesis I show that <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramids</b> and size spectra are equivalent and interchangeable representations of community structure. Key constraints on the slopes of size spectra – particularly mean community predator-to-prey-mass ratio (PPMR) – also constrain the shapes of <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramids,</b> meaning that IBPs are unlikely for closed communities. There are surprisingly few quantitative descriptions of <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramids,</b> and PPMR has not been estimated on reefs. I undertook a detailed case-study and quantify fish community size-structure using underwater vi- sual surveys and empirically estimate PPMR using stable isotopes at a relatively undisturbed island chain in Haida Gwaii, BC. I observe an IBP, but the PPMR estimate suggests that the community should be a stack or bottom-heavy. There is 4 - 5 times more biomass at the largest body-sizes than would be expected given observed PPMR. I hypothesise that the most plausible explanation is energetic subsidies. Using the same fish assemblage I show how two foundational components of habitat complexity (substrate rugosity and kelp canopy characteristics) shape fish community size-structure. Higher kelp canopy cover and den- sity leads to more biomass across all size classes, whereas higher substrate rugosity boosts the biomass of smaller-bodied fishes and leads to a more even distribution of biomass across size classes. Finally, I step back to the global scale and estimate baseline biomass spectra for the world’s reef fishes, accounting for local ecological variation. Current reef fish biomass is {{less than half of the}} baseline expectation and 90 % of the largest (> 1 kg), most functionally-important, individuals are absent. In addition to providing the first global description of how humans have shaped reef <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramids,</b> my thesis gives new insight into how size-based processes underlie the structure and function reef fish communities...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, {{the only}} {{examples}} of inverted biomass pyramids {{have been in}} freshwater and marine planktonic communities. In 2002 and 2008 investigators documented inverted biomass pyramids for nearly pristine coral reef ecosystems within the NW Hawaiian islands and the Line Islands, where apex predator abundance comprises up to 85 % of the fish biomass. We build a new refuge based predator-prey model to study the fish biomass structure at coral reefs and investigate the effect of fishing on biomass pyramids. Utilizing realistic life history parameters of coral reef fish, our model exhibits a stable inverted <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramid.</b> Since the predators and prey are not well mixed, our model does not incorporate homogeneous mixing and the inverted <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramid</b> {{is a consequence of}} the refuge. Understanding predator-prey dynamics in nearly pristine conditions provides a more realistic historical framework for comparison with fished reefs.

40|$|Coral reefs {{around the}} world have {{experienced}} a dramatic decline during the past 25 years. Overfishing is believed to play a major role. There is significant interest in stabilizing and restoring damaged reefs, and first steps include understanding the functioning of reefs in their natural state and examining the effects of fishing. The isolated Kingman and Palmyra reefs are believed to provide a baseline for the natural state of coral reefs. At Kingman, it was recently discovered that apex predators constitute 85 % of the total fish biomass. This is in sharp contrast to most reefs, where the prey biomass substantially dominates the total fish biomass. The recent study at the two pristine reefs also indicates that the predator:prey fish biomass ratio is an increasing function of reef size. Based on these field observations, we model the fish biomass structure at a pristine coral reef. Since the prey hide from predators in the coral, a key component of our model is a refuge. Our model yields both the inverted <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramid</b> and the increasing dependence of the predator:prey biomass ratio on reef size. Thus, refuge may provide a general new mechanism in ecology to create an inverted <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramid,</b> that does not require mass action interactions between predators and prey. We add various forms of fishing to our model, and show that sufficiently high fishing pressure with quite general types of fishing transforms the inverted <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramid</b> to be bottom heavy. We also show a counterintuitive result that prey fishing alone has the same effect. ...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{conservation}} requires rigorous baselines of pristine {{conditions to}} assess the impacts of human activities and to evaluate the efficacy of management. Most coral reefs are moderately to severely degraded by local human activities such as fishing and pollution as well as global change, hence {{it is difficult to}} separate local from global effects. To this end, we surveyed coral reefs on uninhabited atolls in the northern Line Islands to provide a baseline of reef community structure, and on increasingly populated atolls to document changes associated with human activities. We found that top predators and reef-building organisms dominated unpopulated Kingman and Palmyra, while small planktivorous fishes and fleshy algae dominated the populated atolls of Tabuaeran and Kiritimati. Sharks and other top predators overwhelmed the fish assemblages on Kingman and Palmyra so that the <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramid</b> was inverted (top-heavy). In contrast, the <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramid</b> at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati exhibited the typical bottom-heavy pattern. Reefs without people exhibited less coral disease and greater coral recruitment relative to more inhabited reefs. Thus, protection from overfishing and pollution appears to increase the resilience of reef ecosystems to the effects of global warming...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} that the strengths of interactions among populations in biological communities form patterns that are crucial for system stability requires clarification of the precise form of these patterns, how they come about, and why they influence stability. We show that in real food webs, interaction strengths are organized in trophic loops {{in such a way}} that long loops contain relatively many weak links. We show and explain mathematically that this patterning enhances stability, because it reduces maximum "loop weight" and thus reduces the amount of intraspecific interaction needed for matrix stability. The patterns are brought about by <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramids,</b> a feature common to most ecosystems. Incorporation of <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramids</b> in 104 food-web descriptions reveals that the low weight of the long loops stabilizes complex food webs. Loop-weight analysis could be a useful tool for exploring the structure and organization of complex communities...|$|R

40|$|Thomas Schelling {{proposed}} a simple spatial model to illustrate how, even with relatively mild assumptions on each individual's nearest neighbor preferences, an integrated city would likely unravel to a segregated city, {{even if all}} individuals prefer integration. Many authors assumed that the segregation which Schelling observed in simulations on very small cities persists for larger, realistic size cities. We describe how different measures {{can be used to}} quantify the segregation and unlock its dependence on city size, disparate neighbor comfortability threshold, and population density. We develop highly efficient simulation algorithms and quantify aggregation in large cities based on thousands of trials. In particular, we show that for the values of disparate neighbor comfortability threshold used by Schelling, the striking global aggregation Schelling observed is strictly a small city phenomenon. Along the way we prove that in the Schelling model, in the process of evolution, the total perimeter of the interface between the different agents always decreases, which provides a useful analytical tool to study the evolution. At the isolated reef Kingman, it was recently discovered that apex predators constitute 85 % of the total fish biomass. This is in sharp contrast to most reefs, where the prey biomass substantially dominates the total fish biomass. The recent study at the two pristine reefs, Kingman and Palmyra also indicates that the predator:prey fish biomass ratio is an increasing function of reef cover. Based on these field observations, we model the fish biomass structure at a pristine coral reef. We introduce a new refuge based mechanism for predator-prey interaction with an explicit dependence on refuge size. Our refuge based model does not assume mass action interaction between predators and prey and may provide a new mechanism in ecology to produce inverted biomass pyramids. Our model yields both the inverted <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramid</b> and the increasing dependence of the predator:prey biomass ratio on reef cover.

40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) were acknowledged globally as effective tools {{to mitigate the}} threats to oceans caused by fishing. Several studies assessed the effectiveness of individual MPAs in protecting fish assemblages, but regional assessments of multiple MPAs are scarce. Moreover, empirical evidence {{on the role of}} MPAs in contrasting the propagation of non-indigenous-species (NIS) and thermophilic species (ThS) is missing. We simultaneously investigated here the role of MPAs in reversing the effects of overfishing and in limiting the spread of NIS and ThS. The Mediterranean Sea was selected as study area as it is a region where 1) MPAs are numerous, 2) fishing has affected species and ecosystems, and 3) the arrival of NIS and the northward expansion of ThS took place. Fish surveys were done in well-enforced no-take MPAs (HP), partially-protected MPAs (IP) and fished areas (F) at 30 locations across the Mediterranean. Significantly higher fish biomass was found in HP compared to IP MPAs and F. Along a recovery trajectory from F to HP MPAs, IP were similar to F, showing that just well enforced MPAs triggers an effective recovery. Within HP MPAs, trophic structure of fish assemblages resembled a top-heavy <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramid.</b> Although the functional structure of fish assemblages was consistent among HP MPAs, specie...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{recovery}} of historic community assemblages on reefs {{is a primary}} objective {{for the management of}} marine ecosystems. Working under the overall hypothesis that, as fishing pressure increases, the abundance in upper trophic levels decreases followed by intermediate levels, we develop an index that characterizes the comparative health of rocky reefs. Using underwater visual transects to sample rocky reefs in the Gulf of California, Mexico, we sampled 147 reefs across 1200 km to test this reef health index (IRH). Five-indicators described 88 % of the variation among the reefs along this fishing-intensity gradient: the biomass of piscivores and carnivores were positively associated with reef health; while the relative abundances of zooplanktivores, sea stars, and sea urchins, were negatively correlated with degraded reefs health. The average size of commercial macro-invertebrates and the absolute fish biomass increased significantly with increasing values of the IRH. Higher total fish biomass was found on reefs with complex geomorphology compared to reefs with simple geomorphology (r 2 = 0. 14, F= 44. 05, P< 0. 0001) and the trophic <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramid</b> also changed, which supports the evidence of the inversion of biomass pyramids along the gradient of reefs’ health. Our findings introduce a novel approach to classify the health of rocky reefs under different fishing regimes and therefore resultant community structures. Additionally, our IRH provides insight regarding the potential gains in total fish biomass that may result from the conservation and protection of reefs with more complex geomorphology...|$|E
50|$|When {{energy is}} {{transferred}} from one trophic level to the next, typically only ten percent is used to build new biomass.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{properly}} assess human impacts and appropriate restoration goals, baselines of pristine conditions on coral reefs are required. In Saudi Arabian {{waters of the}} central Red Sea, widespread and heavy fishing pressure has been ongoing for decades. To evaluate this influence, we surveyed the assemblage of offshore reef fishes in both this region {{as well as those}} of remote and largely unfished southern Sudan. At comparable latitudes, of similar oceanographic influence, and hosting the same array of species, the offshore reefs of southern Sudan provided an ideal location for comparison. We found that top predators (jacks, large snappers, groupers, and others) dominated the reef fish community biomass in Sudan’s deep south region, resulting in an inverted (top-heavy) <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramid.</b> In contrast, the Red Sea reefs of central Saudi Arabia exhibited the typical bottom-heavy pyramid and show evidence for trophic cascades in the form of mesopredator release. Biomass values from Sudan’s deep south are quite similar to those previously reported in the remote and uninhabited Northwest Hawaiian Islands, northern Line Islands, Pitcairn Islands, and other remote Pacific islands and atolls. The findings of this study suggest that heavy fishing pressure has significantly altered the fish community structure of Saudi Arabian Red Sea reefs. The results point towards the urgent need for enhanced regulation and enforcement of fishing practices in Saudi Arabia while simultaneously making a strong case for protection in the form of marine protected areas in the southern Sudanese Red Sea...|$|E

25|$|Pyramid {{structure}} {{can vary}} across ecosystems and across time. In some instances <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramids</b> can be inverted. This pattern is often identified in aquatic and coral reef ecosystems. The pattern of biomass inversion {{is attributed to}} different sizes of producers. Aquatic communities are often dominated by producers that are smaller than the consumers that have high growth rates. Aquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of secondary growth as exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, {{they are able to}} reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years. Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for <b>pyramids</b> with <b>biomass</b> inverted. Energy <b>pyramids,</b> however, will always have an upright pyramid shape if all sources of food energy are included and this is dictated by the second law of thermodynamics.|$|R

Socioeconomic systems are stratified into a social hierarchy (the social stratification of societies), and all systematic classification schemes (taxonomies) are hierarchical.

40|$|Abstract. Detritivores are small- to {{medium-sized}} invertebrates that comminute {{and break}} down organic {{materials such as}} leaves, twigs and roots, especially within or upon the soil surface, or nearby. Detritivores constitute {{the majority of the}} invertebrate <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramid</b> in most environments and provide a key role in organic matter turnover; they also provide alternative food for polyphagous predators that can be active in pest control on crops. Many arthropod taxa are detritivores in soil and litter layers. Here, we focus on the bioindicator potential of three key detritivore groups: slaters, millipedes and oribatid mites. There are possibly 300 species of slaters (terrestrial isopods or Oniscidea) in Australia with 13 of these being introduced, mostly from north-western Europe. These non-native species are the dominant species in disturbed environments such as intensively managed forests and agricultural fields. Slaters are promising indicators of landscape disturbance, soil contamination and tillage. Millipedes are potentially important indicators of stress in agricultural landscapes, given their sensitivity to litter and soil moisture gradients and to physical and chemical perturbations. However, because there is a close association between the millipede fauna and moist plant communities in Australia, they are generally absent from drier landscapes and, therefore, their use as bioindicators in agricultural environments here is problematic. An exception to this association is the increasingly ubiquitous introduced Black Portuguese millipede. This species is tolerant of much drier conditions than most natives, and is likely to change the nature of nutrient cycling processes in pastures and native grasslands in much of southern Australia. Oribatid mites are present in all Australian terrestrial ecosystems. The few studies that have examined their response to disturbance and land use in Australia are consistent with the body of work conducted outside Australia. This consistent response means that the oribatids may be developed as indicators in agricultural, pasture and forested environments. However, the paucity of information on oribatids over appropriate spatial scales in Australia makes the use of this group extremely difficult at this time...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 85 - 95) In many marine ecosystems worldwide, overfishing is {{a prominent}} cause in removing large predatory fishes from ecological communities. Fluctuation in {{the abundance of}} higher trophic level species can transform an ecosystem???s structure and function by altering trophic interactions through density-mediated top-down control. Accordingly, understanding {{the extent to which}} humans indirectly influence a community through altering predator abundance is of critical importance. Thus, during the summer of 2013 and 2014 the impacts of fishing on the trophic structure and community assemblage of kelp forest fishes were examined within the Southern California Bight. In 2013, I tested whether decreased abundance through fishing for higher trophic level predators relieves predation pressure on lower trophic level prey. Using a combination of underwater survey techniques, density (no. fish/ 100 m 2) and biomass (g/ 100 m 2) of conspicuous fish species were sampled inside and outside of three long-standing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) off La Jolla, Santa Catalina Island, and Anacapa Island, California. I found that secondary carnivore and herbivore/omnivore trophic levels significantly decreased outside of MPAs. Inversely, the primary carnivore trophic level biomass increased outside of MPAs. Species-level results revealed a lower abundance outside MPAs of large kelp bass (> 25 cm) and higher densities of its prey, kelp perch. My results show overall fish trophic level changes due to fishing pressure, and provide support for a weakening of top-down control on the kelp perch population through the removal of predatory fishes outside MPAs. To investigate the possible return of the historically overfished apex predator of the kelp forest fish community, I censused the giant sea bass (Stereolepis gigas) population at eight sites off Santa Catalina Island from mid-June through mid-August, 2014. Three possible spawning aggregations were identified at the sites Twin/Goat, The V???s, and Little Harbor. The giant sea bass population at these sites primarily consisted of individuals 1. 2 - 1. 3 m long (total length, TL) with small and probably newly mature fish (estimated to be 10 - 11 years old) observed in aggregations. However, larger individuals 1. 8 - 1. 9 m TL accounted {{for the majority of the}} population biomass. Overall, mean spawning stock biomass of giant sea bass was 36. 3 kg/ 1000 m 2. Providing a general comparison of mean biomass among the trophic levels of kelp forest fishes off Santa Catalina Island revealed a nearly top-heavy <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramid.</b> The relatively high abundance of giant sea bass provides evidence that this species is recovering at kelp forests off Santa Catalina Island, and possibly throughout the Southern California Bight. The removal or recovery of predators can greatly influence an ecosystem. As more recent studies suggest that indirect community effects of fishing and protection can take up to decades to detect, it is necessary to document the continued changes on the structure, function, and dynamics of the kelp forests and rocky reefs off southern California...|$|E

Early efforts to reconstruct baselines {{resulted in the}} controversial suggestion that pristine coral reefs have inverted trophic pyramids, with disproportionally large top predator biomass. The validity of the coral reef inverted trophic pyramid has been questioned, but until now, was not resolved empirically. We use data from an eight-year tag-recapture program with spatially explicit, capture-recapture models to re-examine the population size and density of a key top predator at Palmyra atoll, the same location that inspired the idea of inverted trophic <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramids</b> in coral reef ecosystems. Given that animal movement is suspected to have significantly biased early biomass estimates of highly mobile top predators, we focused our reassessment on the most mobile and most abundant predator at Palmyra, the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos). We estimated a density of 21. 3 (95 % CI 17. 8, 24. 7) grey reef sharks/km 2, which is {{an order of magnitude}} lower than the estimates that suggested an inverted trophic pyramid. Our results indicate that the trophic structure of an unexploited reef fish community is not inverted, and that even healthy top predator populations may be considerably smaller, and more precarious, than previously thought...|$|R

Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of protected areas for increasing fish abundance or provided insight into the natural abundance and structure of reef fish communities in remote areas. Recently, high apex predator densities (. 100, 000 individuals?km 22) and biomasses (. 4 tonnes?ha 21) have been reported for some remote islands suggesting the occurrence of inverted trophic <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramids.</b> However, few studies have critically evaluated {{the methods used for}} sampling conspicuous and highly mobile fish such as sharks. Ideally, UVC are done instantaneously, however, researchers often count animals that enter the survey area after the survey has started, thus performing non-instantaneous UVC. Methodology/Principal Findings: We developed a simulation model to evaluate counts obtained by divers deploying noninstantaneous belt-transect and stationary-point-count techniques. We assessed how fish speed and survey procedure (visibility, diver speed, survey time and dimensions) affect observed fish counts. Results indicate that the bias caused by fish speed alone is huge, while survey procedures had varying effects. Because the fastest fishes tend to be the largest, the bias would have significant implications on their biomass contribution. Therefore, caution is needed when describing abundance, biomass, and community structure based on non-instantaneous UVC, especially for highly mobile species such as sharks...|$|R

40|$|Our {{ability to}} predict {{community}} responses to environmental stress remains limited. To address this issue, I investigated how species abundance, community composition and food-web structure varied across abiotic gradients (principally disturbance and habitat size) in New Zealand streams. In surveys, community composition, biomass and richness were all {{strongly influenced by}} flood-related habitat disturbance, although disturbance influenced each trophic level via different mechanisms. Experiments indicated that macroinvertebrate prey communities were primarily structured by physical disturbance effects, whereas predatory fish communities were structured by physical disturbance effects and disturbance-mediated changes to prey communities. Prey community biomass and composition affected fish species identity and abundance and an in situ stream channel experiment suggested that prey communities were structured by trade-offs between resisting biotic interactions in physically stable environments and successfully exploiting highly disturbed habitats. The prey community traits associated with different disturbance regimes then directly influenced the composition and predatory impact of the resultant fish communities. In addition to disturbance-mediated biotic interactions, abiotic gradients also provided strong selection pressures on predatory fish communities. In particular, disturbance and habitat size strongly influenced predator community responses (e. g., biomass and maximum body size) in surveys and experiments. However, a habitat’s capacity to support predator community biomass was largely determined by its size. Food-web structure changed with habitat size; small streams supported more prey than predator biomass, whereas large streams had inverted <b>biomass</b> <b>pyramids</b> (i. e., more predator than prey biomass). Similar relationships between food-web structure and habitat size were found in grassland and forested streams, but terrestrial invertebrate subsidies meant that forested streams supported more predator biomass per unit area than grassland stream food webs. My results indicate that human actions resulting in habitat loss (e. g., water abstraction or river impoundment) and increases in flood-related disturbance events (e. g., climate change) {{are likely to have}} significant impacts on stream food webs, ultimately leading to habitats that support smaller fish communities (i. e., less biomass, smaller body size). This means that ecologists and managers will need to consider the separate, interactive and indirect effects of disturbance and habitat size on ecological communities if we are to accurately predict and manage food-web responses to global environmental change...|$|R

The trophic pyramid roughly represents the biomass (usually measured as total dry-weight) at each level. Plants generally have the greatest biomass. Names of trophic categories are shown {{to the right of}} the pyramid. Some ecosystems, such as many wetlands, do not organize as a strict pyramid, because aquatic plants are not as productive as long-lived terrestrial plants such as trees. Ecological trophic pyramids are typically one of three kinds: 1) pyramid of numbers, 2) <b>pyramid</b> of <b>biomass,</b> or 3) <b>pyramid</b> of energy.|$|R

In {{this study we}} investigate the particular effects of overfishing on the structure and function of the southern Benguela food web, using two models with different underlying assumptions: the spatialized, size-based individual-based model, OSMOSE, and the trophic mass-balance model, Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE). Starting from the same reference state of the southern Benguela upwelling ecosystem during the 1990 s, we compare {{the response of the}} food web to scenarios of overfishing using these two modelling approaches. A scenario of increased fishing mortality is applied to two distinct functional groups: i) two species of Cape hake, representing important target predatory fish, and ii) the forage species anchovy, sardine and redeye. In these simulations, fishing mortality on the selected functional groups is doubled for 10 years, followed by 10 years at the initial fishing mortality. We compare the food web states before the increase of fishing mortality, after 10 years of overfishing and after a further 10 years during which fishing was returned to initial levels. In order to compare the simulated food web structures with the reference state, and between the two modelling approaches, we use a set of trophic indicators: the mean trophic level of the community and in catches, the trophic <b>pyramid</b> (<b>biomass</b> per discrete trophic level), and the predatory/forage fish biomass ratio. OSMOSE and EwE present globally similar results for the trophic functioning of the ecosystem under fishing pressure: the biomass of targeted species decreases whereas that of their potential competitors increases. The reaction of distant species is more diverse, depending on the feeding links between the compartments. The mean trophic level of the community does not vary enough to be used for assessing ecosystem impacts of fishing, and the mean trophic level in the catch displays a surprising increase due to the short period of overfishing. The trophic pyramids behave in an unexpected way compared to trophic control theory. because at least two food chains with different dynamics are intertwined within the food web. We emphasize the importance of biomass information at the species level for interpreting dynamics in aggregated indicators, and we highlight the importance of competitive groups when looking at ecosystem functioning under fishing disturbance. Finally, we discuss the results within the scope of differences between models, in terms of the way they are formulated, spatial dimensions, predation formulations and the representation of fish life cycles...|$|R
