5|$|A {{physical}} examination and medical history {{are generally not}} enough to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious bursitis; aspiration of the <b>bursal</b> fluid is often required for this, along with a cell culture and Gram stain of the aspirated fluid. Septic prepatellar bursitis may be diagnosed if the fluid is {{found to have a}} neutrophil count above 1500 per microliter, a threshold significantly lower than that of septic arthritis (50,000 cells per microliter). A tuberculosis infection can be confirmed using a roentgenogram and urinalysis.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} issues {{that can occur}} with horses' legs that may not necessarily cause lameness. Stocking up {{is an issue that}} occurs in horses that are held in stalls for multiple days after periods of activity. Fluid collects in the lower legs, producing swelling and often stiffness. Although it does not usually cause lameness or other problems, prolonged periods of stocking up can lead to other skin issues. Older horses and horse with heavy muscling are more prone to this condition. A shoe boil is an injury that occurs when there is trauma to the <b>bursal</b> sac of the elbow, causing inflammation and swelling. Multiple occurrences can cause a cosmetic sore and scar tissue, called a capped elbow, or infections. Shoe boils generally occur when a horse hits its elbow with a hoof or shoe when lying down. Windpuffs, or swelling {{to the back of the}} fetlock caused by inflammation of the sheaths of the deep digital flexor tendon, appear most often in the rear legs. Soft and fluid-filled, the swelling may initially be accompanied by heat and pain, but can remain long after the initial injury has healed without accompanying lameness. Repeated injuries to the tendon sheath, often caused by excessive training or work on hard surfaces, can cause larger problems and lameness.|$|E

50|$|Infectious <b>Bursal</b> Disease (IBD) is a {{viral disease}} in poultry. Typically, the virus attacks the bursa of young birds, {{preventing}} {{development of the}} immune system.|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{disease is}} {{associated}} to bird age {{with the greatest}} <b>bursal</b> mass, which occurs between 3 and 6 weeks of age. The greatest <b>bursal</b> mass is mostly {{a result of a}} large population of maturing IgM-bearing B-lymphocytes (lymphoblasts), the main target of infection. Young birds at around two to eight weeks of age that have highly active bursa of Fabricius are more susceptible to disease. Birds over eight weeks are resistant to challenge and will not show clinical signs unless infected by highly virulent strains.|$|E

5000|$|Infectious <b>bursal</b> disease, IBD (also {{known as}} Gumboro disease, {{infectious}} bursitis and infectious avian nephrosis) {{is a highly}} contagious disease of young chickens caused by infectious <b>bursal</b> disease virus (IBDV), [...] characterized by immunosuppression and mortality generally at 3 to 6 weeks of age. The disease was first discovered in Gumboro, Delaware in 1962. It is economically important to the poultry industry worldwide due to increased susceptibility to other diseases and negative interference with effective vaccination. In recent years, very virulent strains of IBDV (vvIBDV), causing severe mortality in chicken, have emerged in Europe, Latin America, South-East Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Infection is via the oro-fecal route, with affected bird excreting high levels of the virus for approximately 2 weeks after infection.|$|E

50|$|Infectious <b>bursal</b> disease virus (IBDV) {{was first}} {{discovered}} in Gumboro in 1962, and thus {{has been known}} as Gumboro disease.

50|$|In Dugesia {{the ovaries}} are ventrally situated, they start {{just behind the}} brain, usually {{at the level of}} the fourth {{intestinal}} branch. The <b>bursal</b> canal runs on the right side of the copulatory apparatus and above the atrium. Like some Neppia species, Dugesia have a third layer of longitudinal musculature over the vaginal area of the <b>bursal</b> canal. This feature is not present in other triclads. Another feature shared with Neppia is the presence of a glandular area at the transicional area between the seminal vesicle and the ejaculatory duct, although in Dugesia these glands are concentrated at the diaphragm, a structure not present in any other genera. Ball proposed that the presence of this glands was a synapomorphy of Dugesia and Neppia. The absence of these glands in some Neppia species (N. jeanneli, N. montana and N. schubarti) is thought to be a secondary loss.|$|E
50|$|Subacromial {{impingement}} is {{not free}} of criticism. First, the identification of acromion type shows poor intra- and inter-observer reliability. Second, a computerized three-dimensional study failed to support impingement by any portion of the acromion on the rotator cuff tendons in different shoulder positions. Third, most partial-thickness cuff tears do not occur on <b>bursal</b> surface fibers, where mechanical abrasion from the acromion does occur. Fourth, {{it has been suggested}} that <b>bursal</b> surface cuff tears could be responsible for subacromial spurs and not the opposite. And finally, there is growing evidence that routine acromioplasty may not be required for successful rotator cuff repair, which would be an unexpected finding if acromial shape had a major role in generating tendon lesions. In summary, despite being a popular theory, the bulk of evidence suggest that subacromial impingement probably does not play a dominant role in many cases of rotator cuff disease.|$|E
50|$|Histological {{examination}} of nodules {{shows that they}} consist of a shell of fibrous tissue surrounding a center of fibrinoid necrosis. Pea-sized nodules have one centre. Larger nodules tend to be multilocular, with many separate shells or with connections between the necrotic centres. Individual necrotic centres may contain a cleft or several centres of necrosis may all open on to a large <b>bursal</b> pocket containing synovial fluid.|$|E
50|$|MRI imagining {{can reveal}} fluid {{accumulation}} in the bursa and assess adjacent structures. In chronic cases caused by impingement tendinosis and tears in the rotator cuff may be revealed. At US, an abnormal bursa may show (1) fluid distension, (2) synovial proliferation, and/or (3) thickening of the <b>bursal</b> walls. In any case, {{the magnitude of}} pathological findings does not correlate with {{the magnitude of the}} symptoms.|$|E
50|$|The {{freshwater}} gastropod genus Marstonia {{is composed}} of 15 small (shell height < 5.0 mm), ovate- to elongate-shelled species. Marstonia differs from the other eight North American nymphophiline genera in that the (female) oviduct and <b>bursal</b> duct join well in front of (instead of behind) the posterior wall of the pallial cavity. It has also been resolved as a well supported sub-clade within its subfamily based on mtDNA sequences.|$|E
50|$|The central organ for B cell {{development}} in birds is the Bursa of Fabricius. The {{function of the}} bursa was discovered when it was surgically removed from neonatal chicks and this led to an impaired antibody response to Salmonella typhimurium. It {{is now clear that}} the bursa is the primary site of B cell lymphopoeisis and that avian B cell development has some unique properties compared to human or mouse models.Almost all the B cell progenitors in the bursa of 4-day-old chickens express IgM on their cell surface. Studies have shown that B cells of 4 - 8 week old birds are derived from 2 - 4 allotypically committed precursor cells in each follicle. <b>Bursal</b> follicles are colonized by 2-5 pre-bursal stem cells and these undergo extensive proliferation after they are committed to an allotype. Expression of IgM is controlled by a biological clock as opposed to the <b>bursal</b> microenvironment. Moreover, the source of all B cells in adult birds was determined to be a population of self-renewing sIg+ B cells.|$|E
