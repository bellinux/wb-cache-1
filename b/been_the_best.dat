5|$|The Scottish Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year (often {{called the}} SFWA Footballer of the Year, or simply the Scottish Footballer of the Year) is an annual award {{given to the}} player who is adjudged to have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> {{of the season in}} Scottish football.|$|E
5|$|Garcia's {{best season}} came in 1954 when the Indians won a league record 111 games. Baseball {{historian}} Stephen Lombardi said that Garcia may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> AL pitcher that year. Garcia remained with the Indians until 1959, but never duplicated the success he had achieved in 1954. In his last five seasons with Cleveland, {{he finished with}} losing records three times. After leaving the Indians, Garcia spent a season with the Chicago White Sox and a season with the Washington Senators.|$|E
5|$|The Reg Hayter Cup for the NatWest PCA Player of the Year is {{an annual}} cricket award. It is {{presented}} to the player who is adjudged to have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> {{of the year in}} English county cricket. The award has been given since the 1970 season and the winner is chosen by a vote amongst the members of the players' trade union, the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA). With the exception of the first year, when a joint award was made, the award has been bestowed upon one individual each season. The winning player is awarded the Reg Hayter Cup, named after a sports journalist who was {{also a member of the}} Marylebone Cricket Club, a Lord's Taverner, and a life-member of Surrey County Cricket Club.|$|E

5|$|This {{was the end}} of U.S. air support, {{the last}} American {{aircraft}} departing Cambodian airspace on 15 August. From the beginning of Operation Breakfast the U.S. Air Force had dropped 539,129 tons of ordnance on Cambodia, 257,465 tons of which had been dropped during the last six months of the operation. During 1974, Cambodia continued to collapse. More than half of the population had become refugees and malnutrition and disease stalked a nation that had once <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> fed in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|After the 1917 Finnish {{independence}} and the Civil War, the other Scandinavian countries would have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> candidates for a political alliance. Swedo-Finnish cooperation represented a rich vein of shared history {{in the culture of}} both nations, and the Swedish-speaking Finns had a common language with Swedes. During the Civil War, however, Sweden briefly occupied the Åland Islands and later supported the local movement that wanted to secede from Finland and join the islands to Sweden. The dispute was resolved by the League of Nations in 1921 and the Åland remained Finnish, but were granted autonomy. Other obstacles to closer relations were the ongoing language strife on the status of the Swedish language in Finland. Sweden had also opposed the upper-class resistance movement against Russification. As a result, young Finnish men received their military training in Germany, generating the Jäger Movement. Nevertheless, Finnish–Swedish relations improved considerably before the Winter War.|$|E
5|$|The next day's {{stage was}} preceded by a minute's silence, and ridden as a {{procession}} in Weylandt's memory. In keeping with convention, there was no competitive racing. Each of the 23 teams took {{to the front of}} the peloton for about 15 minutes, and the remaining Leopard Trek squad, along with Farrar, were allowed to finish first with their arms around each other. Millar led the rest of the field across the line a few seconds later. No results for the stage were recorded, and it did not count towards the general classification or any of the points competitions. After the stage, instead of any podium presentations, the four jersey classification leaders (Millar, Alessandro Petacchi, Gianluca Brambilla, and Jan Bakelants) appeared on stage with the Leopard Trek team to lead another moment of silence. Subsequently, Farrar and the remaining Leopard Trek squad all decided to leave the race. Feillu did not want to leave the Giro, feeling that continuing to race would have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> way to honor Weylandt, but he did not mind acquiescing to his teammates' will. For most of them, the decision was based on a desire to attend Weylandt's funeral, which took place nine days after his death. Members of the Giro squad served as pallbearers. Other teammates, as well as Farrar, members of Weylandt's former team , and Giro director Angelo Zomegnan were all in attendance, along with hundreds of cycling fans assembled outside the chapel.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, war films, musicals and {{historical}} dramas {{have been the}} most popular genres, but franchise films have been among the best performers in the 21st century. Seven Harry Potter films and five films from Peter Jackson's Middle-earth series are included in the nominal earnings chart, while the Star Wars and Pirates of the Caribbean franchises feature prominently. There is also continued interest in the superhero genre: Batman and Superman from DC Comics and films based on the Marvel Comics brand, such as Spider-Man, X-Men and films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, have generally done well. The only films in the top ten that are not adapted from a pre-existing property or a sequel are the top two, Avatar and Titanic, both directed by James Cameron. Animated family films have performed consistently well, with Disney films enjoying lucrative re-releases prior to the home-video era. Disney also enjoyed later success with films such as Frozen (the highest-grossing animated film), Zootopia and The Lion King, as well as with its Pixar brand, of which the Toy Story and Finding Nemo films have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> performers. Beyond Disney and Pixar animation, the Shrek, Ice Age and Despicable Me series have met with the most success.|$|E
5|$|UK Sport, the {{organisation}} responsible for distributing National Lottery funding to elite sport, set Team GB {{a target of}} winning three medals, of any colour, at the Vancouver Games; two more than the single silver medal won in Turin by Shelley Rudman. If achieved this would have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> performance by a British Winter Olympics team since 1936 when a gold, silver and bronze medal were won. The target was set following £6.5 million of funding {{in the four years}} leading up to the Games. Whilst no particular events were targeted as potential sources of medals, the success of British athletes in the previous four years was taken into account when setting the target; the men's curling team and the two-woman bobsleigh team, Nicola Minichiello and Gillian Cooke, won world championships, and in 2008 Kristan Bromley became the first man in the history of bob skeleton to win the World Championship, European Championship and World Cup in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{at the end}} of the 19th century, the Brazilian {{abolitionist}} leader Joaquim Nabuco {{said that}} Rio Branco was—of all the politicians who held the office during PedroII's reign—the most fitted to the post of President of the Council of Ministers. Nabuco considered him one of the greatest statesmen of the Empire. However, he also argued that as a leader, a lawmaker, and a creator of doctrines, there were many other politicians far better than Rio Branco. But unlike all the others, who were brilliantly accomplished in one or a few skills, but lacking in many others, Rio Branco was good—though unexceptional—in all. In other words, he was a competent generalist. Nabuco's view was that due to Rio Branco's lack of first-rate abilities, he would not have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> leader in troubled times—such as the anarchy which existed during PedroII's minority, or {{at the end of}} a period of chaos when strong action was needed to rebuild. Rio Branco was, however, the perfect choice in a time of peace and stability where his multiple skills could shine. His ability exactly fit the situation in Brazil when he became President of the Council of Ministers in 1871.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Optimum {{band and}} band {{combination}} for retrieving total nitrogen, water and fiber content in tealeaves with remote sensing data is investigated based on regressive analysis. Based on actual measured data of total nitrogen, fiber and water content in tealeaves {{as well as}} remotely sensed visible to near infrared reflectance data with 5 nm of wavelength steps and ASTER/VNIR onboard Terra satellite, regressive analysis <b>is</b> conducted. As <b>the</b> results, it <b>is</b> found that 1045 nm <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> wavelength for retrieving total nitrogen content while 945 nm <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> wavelength for fiber content retrieval.
