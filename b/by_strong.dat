5|$|High cliffs, sandbars {{and piles}} of pebbles testify to the {{existence}} of strong wave action on the northeastern shore, which was influenced <b>by</b> <b>strong</b> northwesterly winds.

50|$|The {{development}} of the cavus foot structure seen in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease has been previously linked to an imbalance of muscle strength around the foot and ankle. A hypothetical model proposed by various authors describes a relationship whereby weak evertor muscles are overpowered <b>by</b> <b>stronger</b> invertor muscles, causing an adducted forefoot and inverted rearfoot. Similarly, weak dorsiflexors are overpowered <b>by</b> <b>stronger</b> plantarflexors, causing a plantarflexed first metatarsal and anterior pes cavus.|$|R
5|$|As it {{had been}} two decades since much silver was {{regularly}} deposited for striking into coins, {{the fact that the}} United States had been on a bimetallic standard since 1792 was often forgotten.

5|$|As the UK economy {{continues}} {{to recover from the}} downturn experienced in 2008–10, Manchester compares favourably to other geographies according to the latest figures.

The city experienced a relatively sharp {{increase in the number of}} business deaths, the largest increase of all the Core Cities, however this was offset <b>by</b> <b>strong</b> growth in new businesses which resulted in a strong net growth.|$|E
5|$|At the storm's initial {{landfall}} {{in southern}} Florida, heavy rains and strong winds caused extensive damage to crops, particularly to avocado and citrus. As the strengthening hurricane {{moved to the}} northwest through the Gulf of Mexico, it generated strong surf that caused severe damage to coastal areas across western Florida. At its second landfall, hurricane force winds were produced across a wide swath of the coast. Agricultural lands in coastal regions of Mississippi and Alabama were damaged <b>by</b> <b>strong</b> winds and heavy rain. The hurricane caused one indirect death and $228,500 in total damages across its path.|$|E

5|$|August 24, 1893 — Hog Island is {{washed away}} <b>by</b> <b>strong</b> storm surge {{associated}} with a tropical storm of unknown strength.

5|$|Cornerback Fernando Bryant led the team's pass defense. He {{finished}} {{the season with}} 51 tackles and two interceptions. He was supported <b>by</b> <b>strong</b> safety Marcus Spencer, who led the Crimson Tide in interceptions with four. Alabama's sole All-Southeastern Conference selection was punter Daniel Pope, a senior who averaged a school-record 44 yards per kick {{during the regular season}} and was second nationally in net punting at 40.8 yards per kick. Of his 60 punts, 20 were inside the opponents' 20-yard line. None were blocked.|$|E

5|$|Food webs exhibit {{principles}} of ecological emergence through {{the nature of}} trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., primary predators). Theoretical and empirical studies identify non-random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time. Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked <b>by</b> <b>strong</b> interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability. Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, the Fascist {{government}} {{attempted to}} have the Italian national flag redesigned by having the fasces, the symbol used by the Fascist movement, included in the flag. However, this attempt by the Fascist government to change the Italian flag to incorporate the fasces was stopped <b>by</b> <b>strong</b> opposition to the proposal by Italian monarchists. Afterwards, the Fascist government raised the national tricolour flag along with a Fascist black flag in public ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Janet {{made its}} final {{landfall}} in the Mexican state of Veracruz between {{the cities of}} Nautla and Veracruz as a Category2 hurricane at 2200UTC on September29. In Nautla, communications were cut <b>by</b> <b>strong</b> winds from the hurricane. The strong winds also caused a relief plane to crash, causing five deaths. Heavy rains in the Tampico, Tamaulipas area added to floods caused by hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year. The resulting flood was reported by the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans {{to be one of}} the worst natural disasters in Mexican history. In Tampico, 16in (410mm) of rain was reported. The floods contributed to a localized typhoid fever and dysentery outbreak, causing over 1,000people to evacuate out of the city to prevent further spreading of the diseases. An additional 36,000people were being cared for in concentration centers. Although located south of where Janet made landfall, areas of Veracruz were inundated <b>by</b> <b>strong</b> storm surge, including the city's main streets and port. Operations along a railroad stretching from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City were stopped, after having just reopened due to Hurricane Hilda.|$|E

5|$|LTP can {{be induced}} either <b>by</b> <b>strong</b> tetanic {{stimulation}} {{of a single}} pathway to a synapse, or cooperatively via the weaker stimulation of many. When one pathway into a synapse is stimulated weakly, it produces insufficient postsynaptic depolarization to induce LTP. In contrast, when weak stimuli are applied to many pathways that converge on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, the individual postsynaptic depolarizations generated may collectively depolarize the postsynaptic cell enough to induce LTP cooperatively. Synaptic tagging, discussed later, may be a common mechanism underlying associativity and cooperativity. Bruce McNaughton argues that any difference between associativity and cooperativity is strictly semantic.|$|E
5|$|Newfoundland is {{also known}} for its fog which occurs most often {{in the spring and}} early summer because of the {{contrast}} between sea and air temperatures.

5|$|Prior to 2015, only 32 {{individuals}} {{had been}} recorded in western Europe, {{the majority in}} Finland and Sweden, but in October and early November 2016 at least 232 were reported.

The UK Met Office suggested that the influx of accentors was driven <b>by</b> <b>strong</b> and persistent easterly winds from Siberia, partially driven by a high-pressure area centred over Scandinavia.
