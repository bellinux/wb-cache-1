5|$|In the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, the Ivory Coast {{were drawn}} {{in a group}} with Nigeria, Mali and underdogs Benin. Drogba scored two goals in the group stage, opening the scoring in the 4–1 win over Benin, {{as well as in}} the 3–0 win over Mali. In the quarter-finals, Drogba was on the score sheet once again in the 5–0 win over Guinea with the last four goals coming in the final twenty minutes. The semi-final was a rematch of the 2006 final against Egypt, but it was to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road for Drogba and the Ivory Coast, losing 4–1 to the {{eventual}} champions. On 9 February, Drogba lost 4–2 to hosts Ghana and thus ended their run in the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, the US 2nd Infantry Division, {{with several}} armor and antiaircraft {{artillery}} units, {{was ordered to}} proceed to the Far East. The next day, MacArthur requested that the 2nd Division be brought to full war strength, if possible, without delaying its departure. He also reiterated his need of the units required to bring the four infantry divisions already in the Far East to full war strength. He detailed these as four heavy tank battalions, 12 heavy tank companies, 11 infantry battalions, 11 field artillery battalions, and four antiaircraft automatic weapons battalions per division. By August 7, the US 9th Infantry Regiment was operational in Korea, and {{had been sent to}} the Naktong Bulge area. However it would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> month before the rest of the 2nd Infantry Division arrived in Korea.|$|E

50|$|Termination, as used by Quaternary geologists, oceanographers, and paleoclimatologists <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{period of}} time during an glacial cycle {{when there is a}} {{relatively}} rapid transition from full glacial climates to full interglacial climates. For the Quaternary period, terminations are numbered using Roman numerals from the most recent termination as “I” and with increasing value, e.g. “II”, “III”, and so forth, into the past. Termination I, also known as the Last Glacial Termination, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Marine isotope stage 2; Termination II <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Marine Isotope Stage 6; Termination III <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Marine Isotope Stage 8; Termination IV <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Marine Isotope Stage 10, and so forth.|$|R

25|$|On 10 March, Israeli forces {{secured the}} Southern Negev, {{reaching}} {{the southern tip}} of Palestine: Umm Rashrash on the Red Sea (where Eilat was built later) and taking it without a battle.

25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} {{has been that the}} critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs.

They would shout back at us and that would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story.

25|$|In 1916 {{progress}} was further hindered with the New Zealand Government Railways (NZR) changing its mind {{on how the}} line was to connect with their line at Kakahi station. This meant that the Egmont Box Company would need to spend a very large {{amount of money to}} change the route to that now required to join up with the NZR line at Kakahi. This was money the company did not have and nor did the Tongariro Timber Company. Tudor Atkinson tried very hard to obtain the necessary capital but from this time onwards it was to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scheme as far as the Tongariro Timber Company and Egmont Box Company were concerned.|$|E

25|$|Rime {{was hired}} as coach ahead of the 1977 season, which ended in only a single win, last place {{in the league and}} relegation. The {{following}} season would see Rosenborg play a local derby {{for the first time in}} twelve years, against Strindheim, and the club management was worried that the relegation would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club's position as the city's premier team. The club moved its offices into a German barracks from the war, located outside Lerkendal and Eggen was again hired as coach. The season saw the break-through of three young players—Øivind Husby, Ola By Rise and Knut Torbjørn Eggen—and ended with Rosenborg winning the league and being promoted and Eggen becoming top scorer.|$|E
25|$|Major {{replaced}} the Poll Tax with the Council Tax and oversaw successful British {{involvement in the}} Gulf War. Despite a recession, Major led the Conservatives to a surprise victory in 1992. The events of Black Wednesday in 1992, party disunity over the European Union and several scandals involving Conservative politicians led to Labour under Tony Blair winning a landslide election victory in 1997. Labour had shifted its policies closer to the political centre, under the new slogan 'New Labour'. The Bank of England was given independence over monetary policy and Scotland and Wales were both given a devolved Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly respectively. A devolved power sharing Northern Ireland Executive was established in 1998, believed by many to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Troubles.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR)- {{which was}} slow in {{accepting}} diesels- {{finally decided to}} retire its steam fleet, which was {{the largest in the}} world at that time, and buy a large order of diesels. Baldwin bid, expecting its lifelong loyal customer to help keep Baldwin in business by buying at least some Baldwin diesels. General Motors' EMD division, however, gave the PRR an exceptional deal on new, reliable GP9s, so the PRR— which was in a financial pinch itself— sent the business to GM. This one lost deal proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line, and—after 125 years of continuous production—Baldwin closed most of its Eddystone plant. It produced no more locomotives after 1956, instead concentrating on heavy construction equipment. More than 70,500 locomotives had been produced when production ceased in 1956.|$|E

25|$|During {{the relief}} attempt Vere was {{inspecting}} the English trenches when heavy fighting broke {{out as a}} sally was launched on the position. The Spanish were repelled but Vere was severely injured when a bullet went through his head beneath his eye and became embedded in his skull. For Vere it would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war but the bullet was removed as he took up rest in Ryswick and {{was not able to}} take to the field again {{by the end of the}} year. As a consequence of Vere's wound the young Frederick Henry who was only eighteen years old took over Vere's command, while Horace Vere (brother to Francis) took over the English troops in the field. The Earl of Leicester arrived at the siege in late August in case Francis' wound was mortal and needed to fill in his command but this was denied by Queen Elizabeth I.|$|E
25|$|During this time, Li Si and Zhao Gao fell out, and Li Si was executed. Zhao Gao {{decided to}} force Qin Er Shi {{to commit suicide}} due to Qin Er Shi's incompetence. Upon this, Ziying, a nephew of Qin Er Shi, ascended the throne, and {{immediately}} executed Zhao Gao. Ziying, seeing that increasing unrest was growing among the people and that many local officials had declared themselves kings, attempted to cling to his throne by declaring himself one king among all the others. He was undermined by his ineptitude, however, and popular revolt broke out in 209 BC. When Chu rebels under the lieutenant Liu Bang attacked, a state in such turmoil could not hold for long. Ziying was defeated near the Wei River in 207 BC and surrendered shortly after; he was executed by the Chu leader Xiang Yu. The Qin capital was destroyed the next year, and this is considered by historians to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qin empire. Liu Bang then betrayed and defeated Xiang Yu, declaring himself Emperor Gaozu of the new Han dynasty on 28 February 202 BC. Despite the short duration of the Qin dynasty, it was very influential {{on the structure of}} future dynasties.|$|E
25|$|The company {{continued}} {{to develop new}} text adventure games, expanding in size to over 100 employees at its peak; by 1984, they had sold over $10 million in game software. Their success drew writer Douglas Adams, who had loved Zork, to help produce two games through them: the first based on Douglas Adams' popular Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and an original work called Bureaucracy. The company also attempted to expand into business software, writing the relational database program Cornerstone, released in 1985; though Cornerstone was well-received, its release was {{at a time of}} a slump in software sales, and the company lost a significant amount of money on the title, as well as divided the company internally on progress going forward. Struggling for funding, Infocom was bought by Activision in 1986 and returned to adventure game development, but following that, the increased power of home microcomputers and graphic-driven games saw the demand for Infocom titles decline. Infocom was late to add graphics to its games as to be able to compete with other titles until 1987. By 1989, the Infocom division at Activision had been reduced to 10 employees, and was ultimately shuttered; Activision would continue to develop some text adventure games inhouse using the Infocom brand but with no connection to the original team. The demise of Infocom is considered to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commercial age for interactive fiction, but its legacy would remain; the Z-machine remains a popular source for running non-commercial interactive fiction games developed in more modern tools such as Inform.|$|E
