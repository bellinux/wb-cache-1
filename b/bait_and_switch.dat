25|$|In the 1970s, Klass heaped praise on {{astronomer}} and UFO investigator Allan Hendry's The UFO Handbook, but Hendry objected {{strongly to}} Klass's modus operandi, which Hendry argued consisted of suppressing and distorting evidence, unscientific reasoning, ad hominem attacks, smear campaigns, scientific <b>bait</b> <b>and</b> <b>switch</b> tactics, and seemingly refusing to evaluate evidence that conflicted with his preconceptions. Nuclear physicist and UFO researcher Stanton T. Friedman also frequently jousted with Klass.|$|E
25|$|The {{second major}} area of social {{influence}} research is compliance. Compliance refers to {{any change in}} behavior that {{is due to a}} request or suggestion from another person. The foot-in-the-door technique is a compliance method in which the persuader requests a small favor and then follows up with requesting a larger favor, e.g., asking for the time and then asking for ten dollars. A related trick is the <b>bait</b> <b>and</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E
500|$|The release {{also drew}} criticism. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who {{independently}} released his sixth album Ghosts I-IV under a Creative Commons licence the following year, thought {{it did not}} go far enough, calling it [...] "very much a <b>bait</b> <b>and</b> <b>switch,</b> {{to get you to}} pay for a MySpace-quality stream as a way to promote a very traditional record sale." [...] Singer Lily Allen called it [...] "arrogant", saying: [...] " [...] millions of pounds. It sends a weird message to younger bands who haven't done as well. You don't choose how to pay for eggs. Why should it be different for music?" [...] In the Guardian, journalist Will Hodgkinson wrote: [...] "Spare a thought for the thousands upon thousands of bands and singers who, nowhere near Radiohead's levels of fame and fortune, now have pretty much no chance of ever making a living from their music." [...] Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth told the Guardian the release [...] "seemed really community-oriented, but it wasn't catered towards their musician brothers and sisters, who don’t sell as many records as them. It makes everyone else look bad for not offering their music for whatever." ...|$|E
50|$|As Sugimoto {{approached}} Weaver from behind, Weaver radioed he {{was attacked}} and cut {{inside of the}} turn to present a more difficult shot. McGuire eased up on his turn rate {{in an effort to}} draw the attacker off of his wingman and onto himself. Sugimoto took the <b>bait</b> <b>and</b> <b>switched</b> his attack to McGuire. As Sugimoto approached from behind, McGuire rapidly increased his turn rate. This extremely dangerous maneuver, performed at an altitude of only 300 ft (contrary to McGuire's own dictates never to engage at a low altitude), caused McGuire's P-38 to stall. It snap rolled inverted and nosed down into the ground. Despite the low altitude, McGuire nearly pulled out successfully; had he jettisoned his drop tanks {{at the start of the}} dogfight, he might have managed it. McGuire was killed on impact.|$|R
5000|$|Over the years, {{there have}} been many {{instances}} where trailers give misleading representations of their films. They may give the impression that a celebrity who only has a minor part in the film {{is one of the main}} cast members, or advertising a film as being more action-packed than it is. These tricks are usually done to draw in a larger audience. Sometimes the trailers include footage not from the film itself. This could be an artistic choice, or because the trailer was put together before the film's final cut, but at other times it is to give the audience a different impression of the movie. Then trailers could be misleading in a 'for the audience's own good' kind of way, in that a general audience would not usually see such a film due to preconceptions, <b>and</b> by <b>bait</b> <b>and</b> <b>switching,</b> they can allow the audience to have a great viewing experience that they would not ordinarily have. However, the opposite is true too, with the promise of great trailers being let down by mediocre films. An American woman sued the makers of Drive because their film [...] "failed to live up to its promo's promise", although her lawsuit was dismissed.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{because of the}} investigator’s concern {{about the lack of}} information in the area of consumer fraud and the recent development individualized learning systems. The study examined the knowledge of 59 college home economics women students attending the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and 76 home extension club women from Dawson County, Nebraska. The study had the following purposes: (1) To examine current knowledge levels of learning in the following areas of consumer fraud of college home economics women students and home extension club women: a. false advertising and false labeling b. misrepresentation of prices c. <b>bait</b> advertising <b>and</b> <b>switch</b> d. something for nothing e. selling under false pretenses, (2) To examine knowledge, comprehension and application levels of learning about fraud after respondents are exposed to the individualized learning packet materials, (3) To determine if individualized learning packet produces a significant change in the knowledge, comprehension and application levels of learning concerning consumer fraud. Designing the study involved developing an examination, individualized learning packet, and background questionnaire; selecting the sample; and collecting the data. A one hundred question examination was written with fifty true-false questions and fifty multiple-choice questions. An individualized learning packet, consisting of learning objectives, media including two Changing Times magazine articles, and a self-test was developed. The background questionnaire was constructed primarily of closed-end questions to gain factual information and to serve as a guide to studying the influence affecting the respondents’ knowledge of consumer fraud.

5000|$|Over the years, {{business}} models have {{become much more}} sophisticated. The <b>bait</b> <b>and</b> hook business model (also {{referred to as the}} [...] "razor and blades business model" [...] or the [...] "tied products business model") was introduced in the early 20th century. This involves offering a basic product at a very low cost, often at a loss (the [...] "bait"), then charging compensatory recurring amounts for refills or associated products or services (the [...] "hook"). Examples include: razor (<b>bait)</b> <b>and</b> blades (hook); cell phones (<b>bait)</b> <b>and</b> air time (hook); computer printers (<b>bait)</b> <b>and</b> ink cartridge refills (hook); <b>and</b> cameras (<b>bait)</b> <b>and</b> prints (hook).

[...] Robert Christgau gave <b>Bait</b> <b>and</b> <b>Switch</b> an A- rating, writing that the first five songs on the album [...] "rush by in a perfect furious tunefest". Another review of this album appeared in Spin, in which Eric Weisbard wrote that [...] "House was right to reground his art, putting the way music flows and falls before singer-songwriterly commentary." [...] He also said that on the album, House begins the process of doing something with noise, but that he does not go far enough. In Billboard, David Sprague wrote that <b>Bait</b> <b>and</b> <b>Switch</b> [...] "retains the relaxed, lo-fi vibe" [...] that was apparent on the bands early singles.|$|E
