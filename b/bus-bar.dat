40|$|When a {{power system}} is in the alert state, a severe {{contingency}} may bring the system into the emergency state, resulting in overloads, voltage violations, cascading failures, or even loss of stability, and force system operators to take appropriate corrective control actions. It is widely known that transmission system reconfiguration (TSR), including transmission line switching, <b>bus-bar</b> switching, shunt element switching, transformer tap changing, and FACTS control, may change {{the states of the}} power systems, and consequently, affect the distribution of power flows, transmission losses, short circuit currents, voltage profiles as well as the transient stability of power systems. Under the restructured environment of the power industry, TSR has a great advantage in economy compared with other corrective control methods, such as load shedding and system islanding, since it almost has no effect on generation and load, and thereby, becomes a very attractive research topic for on-line corrective control;Focusing on line and <b>bus-bar</b> switching, shunt element switching, and corrective FACTS control, this dissertation has proposed a general framework for employing TSR actions to relieve overloads and voltage violations caused by system contingencies. In this dissertation, a new line and <b>bus-bar</b> switching algorithm for relieving overloads and voltage violations is proposed based on fast decoupled power flow with limited iteration count. A novel shunt switching algorithm is also presented for corrective voltage control based on the newly derived voltage distribution factor. These two algorithms are then integrated into one corrective switching algorithm. Furthermore, an LP-based OPF algorithm is developed for corrective FACTS control based on the newly derived parameter sensitivities of FACTS devices such that the operational constraints of FACTS devices can be considered during optimization. In order to improve computation speed, a general power compensation model is proposed for line and <b>bus-bar</b> switching, and a BIP-based OPF algorithm is developed for line and <b>bus-bar</b> switching {{on the basis of the}} proposed model.

In order to adjust the not completely homogeneous magnetic feld of the main dipole magnets, amongst others, sextupole correctcorrector magnets are used. In one of the 16 corrector magnet circuits placed in the LHC, 154 of these sextupole corrector magnets (MCS) are connected in series. This circuit extends on a 3. 35 km tunnel section of the LHC. In 2015, {{at one of the}} 16 circuits a fault was detected. The simulation of this circuit is helpful for fnding the fault by applying alternating current at different frequencies.

30|$|Modern power systems, {{employing}} {{an increasing}} number of converter-based renewable energy sources (RES) and decreasing the usage of conventional power plants, are leading to lower levels of short-circuit power and rotational inertia. A solution to this is the employment of synchronous condensers in the grid, in order to provide sufficient short-circuit power. This results in the increase of the short-circuit ratio (SCR) at transmission system <b>bus-bars</b> serving as points of interconnection (POI) to renewable generation. Evaluation of the required capacity and grid-location of the synchronous condensers, is inherently a mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem, which could not be done on manual basis considering each type of machine and all <b>bus-bars.</b> This study therefore proposes a method of optimal allocation of synchronous condensers in a hypothetic future scenario of a transmission system fed by renewable generation. Total cost of synchronous condenser installations in the system is minimized and the SCRs at the POIs of central renewable power plants are strengthened. The method has potential for application on larger grids, aiding grid-integration of RES.|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} {{of a system}} {{is its ability to}} return to normal or stable operation after having been subjected to some forms of disturbances.

The results of the work showed that the single machine system supplying an infinite <b>bus-bar</b> fluctuates while the 2 -machine system remains unstable throughout the period.
