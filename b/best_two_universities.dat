50|$|Beijing 101 Middle School {{is renowned}} for its study environment. Its 200,000 square meter campus is {{surrounded}} by the Old Summer Palace, one of China's most splendid imperial palaces. Dozens of ponds dot the whole campus. 13,000 square meters of 101 are covered by water. Peking University and Tsinghua University, known as the <b>best</b> <b>two</b> <b>universities</b> in mainland China, are both within half a mile. The school has undergone reconstruction work since 2005. The school's academic facilities include a library housing 100,000 books and magazines, an electronic library, 100 classrooms with multi-media equipment, a lecture hall, a 700-people auditorium, an information center, a 300 m2 greenhouse supported by NASA and China Space Center.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  5, we can {{found that there}} are three major topics in {{educational}} blog, including “NCEE”, “University”, and “China”. The hot topic “NCEE” grows from the facet term to focal term and then declines to facet term from April, 2010 to Sep. 2010, which implies that the discussion focus reveal the key event (i.e., the national college entrance examination in June each year in China) in real world scenario. It is obvious that related topics, such as score, high school, and policy are mostly discussed by people during that period. Notably, there is an interesting finding that “The National College Entrance Examination” disappears from the hot topic list during the same period in 2011, while “university” is the hot topic instead. In addition, the topic “University” on April, 2011 is split into two topics “China” and “University” with facet terms as “ranking list” and “quality ranking list” on June, 2011. The reason behind that is Shulian Wu, a famous scholar in China, published a list of Chinese university rankings every year around this time. But in 2011, Zhejiang University was ranked the No. 1 University over Peking University and Tsinghua University, which are generally recognized as the <b>best</b> <b>two</b> <b>universities</b> in China. Therefore, it sparked a heated debate among the Internet users in China. Another hot topic “Entrepreneurship” emerges on August with no facet terms, which indicates that there is no common discussion points about it.|$|E

50|$|The SMU-Rice rivalry is a {{secondary}} one for both SMU (after TCU) and Rice (after Houston). However, it is a storied {{one based on}} the fact that SMU is located inside the city of Dallas and Rice is located in Houston, the anchors of Texas' two largest metropolitan areas. Notably, SMU and Rice are two of the smaller universities in NCAA Division I FBS. Adding fuel to the fire is the fact that Rice and SMU are consistently ranked the <b>best</b> <b>two</b> private <b>universities</b> in Texas.|$|R

40|$|A cluster-voting {{scheme is}} {{described}} which takes the output from two speaker diarisation systems and produces a new output {{which aims to}} have a lower speaker diarisation error rate (DER) than either input. The scheme works in two stages, firstly producing a set of possible outputs which minimise a distance metric based on the DER and secondly voting between these alternatives to give the final output. Decisions where the inputs agree are always passed to the output and those where the inputs differ are re-evaluated in the final voting stage. Results are presented on the 6 -show RT- 03 Broadcast News evaluation data, showing the DER can be reduced by 1. 64 % and 2. 56 % absolute using this method when combining the <b>best</b> <b>two</b> Cambridge <b>University</b> and the <b>best</b> <b>two</b> MIT Lincoln Laboratory diarisation systems respectively. 1...|$|R
50|$|Rice and SMU {{had been}} in the same conference with each other from 1918 through 2012, and have played each other 90 times as of 2012 with SMU leading the series 48-41-1. The rivalry is because Rice and SMU were two of four private schools in the old Southwest Conference (Baylor and TCU were the others). Rice and SMU were also the two {{smallest}} schools in the conference, were located in the two largest cities of any teams in the conference (Houston and Dallas, respectively), and have historically been considered the <b>two</b> <b>best</b> private <b>universities</b> in Texas.|$|R
