5000|$|When {{a camera}} is {{operated}} hand-held, the operator's shaky hands cause instabilities in the captured image stream. SteadyShot technology works inside the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> It uses motion sensors {{to detect the}} user's movements. SteadyShot then compensates {{for some of these}} movements, in some versions by moving the optics and in some versions by moving the image sensor in an opposite direction to the movement.|$|E
5000|$|A folding {{camera is}} a camera type. Folding cameras fold into a compact and rugged package for storage. The lens and shutter are {{attached}} to a lens-board which {{is connected to the}} <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> by a light-tight folding bellows. When the camera is fully unfolded it provides the correct focus distance from the film. The key advantage of folding cameras is their excellent physical-size to film-size ratio when the camera is folded for storage.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about <b>the</b> {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MARS camera: a standalone portable digital x-ray camera with spectral sensitivity. It is built {{for use in}} the MARS Spectral system from the Medipix 2 and Medipix 3 imaging chips. Photon counting detectors and Spectral CT are introduced, and Medipix is identified as a powerful new imaging device. The goals and strategy for <b>the</b> MARS <b>camera</b> are discussed. <b>The</b> Medipix chip physical, electronic and functional aspects, and experience gained, are described. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> hardware, firmware and supporting PC software are presented. Reports of experimental work on <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> equalisation from noise, and of tests of charge summing mode, conclude <b>the</b> main <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> has been actively used since late 2009 in pre-clinical research. A list of publications that derive from <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> and <b>the</b> MARS Spectral scanner demonstrates the practical benefits already obtained from this work. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> publications are first-author, eight are co-authored, and a further four acknowledge use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MARS <b>camera</b> as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MARS scanner.

50|$|Within {{a decade}} of being {{introduced}} in America, 3 general forms of camera were in popular use: the American- or chamfered-box <b>camera,</b> <b>the</b> Robert’s-type <b>camera</b> or “Boston box”, and <b>the</b> Lewis-type <b>camera.</b> <b>The</b> American-box <b>camera</b> had beveled edges at the front and rear, and {{an opening in the}} rear where the formed image could be viewed on ground glass. <b>The</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> had hinged doors for placing photographic plates. Inside there was one available slot for distant objects, and another slot in the back for close-ups. The lens was focused either by sliding or with a rack and pinion mechanism. <b>The</b> Robert’s-type <b>cameras</b> were similar to the American-box, except for having a knob-fronted worm gear on <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> which moved <b>the</b> back box for focusing. Many Robert’s-type cameras allowed focusing directly on the lens mount. The third popular daguerreotype camera in America was the Lewis-type, introduced in 1851, which utilized a bellows for focusing. <b>The</b> main <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lewis-type <b>camera</b> was mounted on the front box, but the rear section was slotted into the bed for easy sliding. Once focused, a set screw was tightened to hold the rear section in place. Having the bellows in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> facilitated making a second, in-camera copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original image.|$|R
50|$|The EMI 2001 Broadcast studio {{camera was}} an early, very {{successful}} British made Plumbicon studio camera {{that included the}} lens within the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> Four 30 mm tubes allowed one tube to be dedicated solely to producing a relatively high resolution monochrome signal, with the other three tubes each providing red, green or blue signals. Even though semiconductors were used {{in most of the}} camera, the highly sensitive head amplifiers still used thermionic valves in the first generation of the design.|$|E
50|$|Integrating {{the lens}} within the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> had both {{positive}} and negative effects. On the positive side, it meant the optical nodal point of the camera was close to the centre of gravity, which could make operation easier and more instinctive when used on movable camera mounts such as pedestals. The downside was that lens manufacturers were limited to which lenses they could adapt to fit to the camera. This made the 2001 less attractive for outside broadcasts.|$|E
50|$|To {{understand}} why the glued IOL works better compared to a sutured IOL or AC IOL, let us think of a camera. If we break {{the lens of the}} camera and fix it back to the camera body with sutures and take photos the picture quality will not be good as the lens would be moving. This is what happens in an eye with a sutured IOL as there is movement of the IOL (pseudo phacodonesis). Imagine if we would glue the lens to the camera body both the lens and the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> would move in unison. This is what happens in a glued IOL and there is no movement of the IOL (pseudo phacodonesis) which gives a better picture quality.|$|E

5000|$|EMI {{engineers}} {{visited the}} USA in 1963, {{in order to}} view RCA's new four-tube colour <b>camera,</b> <b>the</b> TK42. Immediately following this visit, EMI Research Labs. embarked on a program to build an experimental <b>camera</b> using <b>the</b> same format. The construction took only six weeks of intensive effort, aided by <b>the</b> cannibalization <b>of</b> parts from existing EMI cameras. Items were taken from an EMI Type 203 image Orthicon monochrome studio <b>camera,</b> for <b>the</b> luminance channel, and a Type 204 industrial colour <b>camera,</b> for <b>the</b> colour channels. This camera contained 3 Vidicon tubes and a colour-splitting system using plate glass dichroic mirrors. In addition, a Varotal III zoom lens was integrated into <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experimental <b>camera.</b> <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> was housed in a simple box-shaped structure with ribs of extruded aluminium and with plain side panels. <b>The</b> experimental <b>camera</b> was demonstrated to the BBC in 1963 where it received a mixed reception. At that time, the BBC was evaluating an early Philips 3-tube camera which used some newly available Plumbicon pick-up tubes. It {{had been set up}} by BBC engineers to give highly saturated colour pictures and they were unimpressed by <b>the</b> 'tinted' pictures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EMI <b>camera.</b> [...] In order to better judge <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> then existing <b>cameras,</b> <b>the</b> BBC organized comparison tests between <b>the</b> experimental EMI <b>camera,</b> a Philips camera, and a Marconi three I.O. camera. In these tests, <b>the</b> colorimetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pictures from <b>the</b> EMI <b>camera</b> compared unfavourably with the other two, but it did give the sharpest pictures.|$|R
5000|$|On <b>the</b> morning <b>of</b> September 12, 1996, López began {{filming the}} final entry to his video diary. The final tape, {{entitled}} [...] "Last Day - Ricardo López", begins with López preparing {{to go to}} the post office to mail the letter bomb. He indicates that he is [...] "very, very nervous" [...] but states that if he arouses suspicion or is detained, he will kill himself rather than be arrested. After returning from the post office, López resumes filming. As Björk's music plays in the background, a nude López shaves his head then paints it with red and green greasepaint. He then colors his lips with black greasepaint. López then spends some time looking at himself in a mirror and tells <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> that he is [...] "a little nervous now. I'm definitely not drunk. I am not depressed. I know exactly what I am doing. It gun is cocked back. It's ready to roll." [...] As Björk's song [...] "I Remember You" [...] finishes playing, López shouts [...] "This is for you" [...] and shoots himself in the mouth with a [...]38 caliber pistol. López groans and his <b>body</b> falls out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> range and then <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> abruptly stopped filming. A hand painted sign bearing the handwritten words [...] "The best of me. Sept. 12" [...] hung on the wall behind him. Police theorized that López intended on covering the sign with his blood and brain matter as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gunshot. That plan failed as the small caliber bullet did not exit López's head and his body fell away from the sign.|$|R
5000|$|Formed in late 1953 at Yokota Air Base, Japan under Fifth Air Force and {{equipped}} with some RF-86F [...] "Haymaker" [...] photo-reconnaissance jets modified in Japan by fitting {{a suite of}} photo-reconnaissance cameras at the Tsuiki REMCO facility in Japan, in a project code-named *Haymaker*. All armament, radars, and gunsights were removed, and a camera suite installed with two K-22 and one K-17 cameras in an under-fuselage installation. The cameras were mounted vertically, which took the main <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> and the film magazines outside the fuselage contours in a bulge on the gun bay door. A total of eight were built (serial numbers 52-4337, 4379,4492, 4800, 4808, 4822, 4823, and 4864). They were flown over North Korea on clandestine reconnaissance missions after the war ended.|$|E
50|$|SLRs {{vary widely}} in their {{construction}} and typically have bodies {{made of plastic}} or magnesium. Most manufacturers do not cite durability specifications, but some report shutter life expectancies for professional models. For instance, the Canon EOS 1Ds MkII is rated for 200,000 shutter cycles and the newer Nikon D3 is rated for 300,000 with its exotic carbon fiber/kevlar shutter. Because many SLRs have interchangeable lenses, {{there is a tendency}} for dust, sand and dirt to get into the main <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> through the mirror box when the lens is removed, thus dirtying or even jamming the mirror movement mechanism or the shutter curtain mechanism itself. In addition, these particles can also jam or otherwise hinder the focusing feature of a lens if they enter into the focusing helicoid. The problem of sensor cleaning has been somewhat reduced in DSLRs as some cameras have a built-in sensor cleaning unit.|$|E
50|$|The Nikkorex 35 was {{the first}} model of the Nikkorex series, {{produced}} in 1960. Several key differences between the F model and the Nikkorex model helped keep the price low: the Nikkorex incorporated a selenium-cell meter mounted behind a honeycomb lens {{on the front of}} the camera rather than through-the-lens metering (as in the Nikon Photomic prism) and used a leaf shutter rather than the more expensive focal-plane shutter found in the Nikon F and similar higher-end SLRs. The Citizen MVL shutter had speeds from 1 second to 1/500th second that were set by a ring on the lens, rather than by the more conventional method of a dial on the top of the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> The ISO (film speed) was also set by a nontraditional lens ring. The lens itself was a fixed four-element Nikkor-Q 50mm 2.5, the limited nature of which was somewhat supplemented by two screw-on accessory lenses, a 35mm wide-angle and a 90mm telephoto, both 5.6.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} Visual Servoing and its {{strictly}} connected disciplines like projective geometry, image processing, robotics and non-linear control. More specifically the work addresses {{the problem to}} control a robotic manipulator through one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largely used Visual Servoing techniques: the Image Based Visual Servoing (IBVS). In Image Based Visual Servoing the robot is driven by on-line performing a feedback control loop that is closed directly in the 2 D space <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> sensor. <b>The</b> work considers <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> a monocular system with <b>the</b> only <b>camera</b> mounted on <b>the</b> robot end effector (eye in hand configuration). Through IBVS the system can be positioned {{with respect to a}} 3 D fixed target by minimizing the differences between its initial view and its goal view, corresponding respectively to the initial and the goal system configurations: the robot Cartesian Motion is thus generated only by means of visual informations. However, <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> a positioning control task by IBVS is not straightforward because singularity problems may occur and local minima may be reached where the reached image is very close to the target one but the 3 D positioning task is far from being fulfilled: this happens in particular for large <b>camera</b> displacements, when <b>the</b> the initial and the goal target views are noticeably different. To overcame singularity and local minima drawbacks, maintaining <b>the</b> good properties <b>of</b> IBVS robustness with respect to modeling and camera calibration errors, an opportune image path planning can be exploited. This work deals with <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> generating opportune image plane trajectories for tracked points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> servoing control scheme (a trajectory is made of a path plus a time law). The generated image plane paths must be feasible i. e. they must be compliant with rigid <b>body</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> with respect to the object so as to avoid image jacobian singularities and local minima problems. In addition, the image planned trajectories must generate camera velocity screws which are smooth and within <b>the</b> allowed bounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot. We will show that a scaled 3 D motion planning algorithm can be devised in order to generate feasible image plane trajectories. Since the paths in the image are off-line generated it is also possible to tune the planning parameters so as to maintain the target inside <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> field <b>of</b> view even if, in some unfortunate cases, the feature target points would leave <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> images due to 3 D robot motions. To test <b>the</b> validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed approach some both experiments and simulations results have been reported taking also into account <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> noise in <b>the</b> path planning strategy. The experiments have been realized with a 6 DOF anthropomorphic manipulator with a fire-wire camera installed on its end effector: the results demonstrate the good performances and <b>the</b> feasibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed approach...|$|R
5000|$|The post 1932 Leica II and Leica III {{cameras were}} {{differentiated}} {{by the latter}} having a [...] "slow speed dial" [...] on <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> to <b>the</b> left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lens mount. After 1940, with <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Leica IIIc, the upper body was die cast rather than stamped and <b>the</b> visual appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> changed with a more prominent shutter-crate around the lens mount -- this was not covered with leather {{as in the previous}} models. <b>The</b> Soviet <b>cameras</b> followed <b>the</b> pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Leica II, while most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Asian <b>cameras</b> included <b>the</b> slow-speed feature.

5000|$|Rank Taylor Hobson {{declined}} {{to offer a}} zoom lens for EMI's new camera, claiming they were fully committed elsewhere, but the Angenieux Company (see Pierre Angenieux) expressed their interest in supplying zoom lenses for the project. The French company offered two zoom lenses for the camera; {{the first was a}} 10:1 zoom for studio use and the second a larger unit for outside broadcasts. Both could be accommodated within the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> although the O.B. lens did protrude a little. [...] To accommodate a 4-way prism splitter, extra distance was needed, {{from the back of the}} lens to the image focal plane, when compared to a 3-tube splitter. This set severe demands for the lens designer, but Angenieux were able to achieve EMI's requirements, provided that field flattening lenses were fitted in front of each pick-up tube. Early cameras used this arrangement, but with later zoom designs these lenses became unnecessary.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{video cameras}} were mechanical flying-spot scanners {{which were in}} use in the 1920s and 1930s {{during the period of}} mechanical television. Improvements in video camera tubes in the 1930s ushered in the era of electronic television. Earlier, cameras were very large devices, almost always in two sections. The camera section held the lens and tube pre-amplifiers and other necessary electronics, and was connected to a large diameter multicore cable to the remainder of the camera electronics, usually mounted in a separate room in the studio, or a remote truck. The camera head could not generate a video picture signal on its own. The video signal was output to the studio for switching and transmission. By the fifties, electronic miniaturization had progressed to the point where some monochrome cameras could operate stand alone and even be handheld. But the studio configuration remained, with the large cable bundle transmitting the signals back to the camera control unit (CCU). The CCU in turn was used to align and operate the camera's functions, such as exposure, system timing, video and black levels.The first color cameras (1950s in the US, early 1960s in Europe), notably the RCA TK-40/41 series, were much more complex with their three (and in some models four) pickup tubes, and their size and weight drastically increased. Handheld color cameras did not come into general use until the early 1970s - the first generation of cameras were split into a camera head unit (the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> containing the lens and pickup tubes, and held on the shoulder or a body brace in front of the operator) connected via a cable bundle to a backpack CCU. The Ikegami HL-33, the RCA TK45 and the Thomson Microcam were portable two piece color cameras introduced in the early 1970s. For field work a separate VTR was still required to record the camera's video output. Typically this was either a portable 1" [...] reel to reel VTR, or a portable 3/4" [...] U-matic VCR. Typically, the two camera units would be carried by the camera operator, while a tape operator would carry the portable recorder. With the introduction of the RCA TK76 in 1976, camera operators were finally able to carry on their shoulders a one piece camera containing all the electronics to output a broadcast quality composite video signal. A separate videotape recording unit was still required.|$|E
40|$|In media production, previsualization is an {{important}} step. It allows the director and the production crew to see {{an estimate of the}} final product during the filmmaking process. This work focuses on a previsualization system for composite shots which involve real and virtual content. It shows the camera operator a correct perspective view of how the real objects in front of him look placed in a virtual space. The aim is to simplify the workflow, reduce production time and allow more direct control of the end result. The real scene is shot with a 3 D scene capture device, which combines an RGB color camera with time-of-flight depth camera. The device’s pose is tracked using a motion capture system. Depth-based segmentation is applied to remove the background and content outside the desired volume, the captured geometry is aligned with a stream from the RGB color camera and a dynamic point cloud of the remaining real scene contents is created. The virtual objects are then also transformed into the coordinate space of the tracked camera, and the resulting composite view is rendered accordingly. The prototype camera system is implemented as a self-contained unit with local processing. A prototype system was constructed from a Microsoft Kinect v 2, providing depth and color information of the real scene and a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 as a processing and display device. Both instruments were attached to a camera shoulder mount, with optical markers fixed to the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> The pose of the camera in 3 D space is tracked with a Natural Point OptiTrack motion capture system, which streams the location information to the Surface device over a wireless 802. 11 n channel. At its current state, the system is running at 15 frames per second with a resolution of 1024 x 768. Subjectively, the frame rate is already smooth enough for the operator to feel as if using a regular camera. Further improvements are targeted in the processing speed and the image quality provided by the system. The image suffers from some depth capture related artifacts which influence the depth segmentation, and therefore adaptive filtering methods based on edge-aware bilateral filtering have been investigated. The tested filtering has improved the quality significantly, while more effort has to be put in implementing the filtering in an efficient way...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a single case-study: the early photofilmic works by Frank (1868 - 1924) and Lillian (1878 - 1972) Gilbreth that were aimed at the study of workers’ motion in view of their {{measurement}} and standardization. More specifically, the paper investigates Gilbreths’ work on the cyclograph, as expounded in Fatigue Study (1916) and Applied Motion Study (1917). Firstly, it analyzes the procedural protocols of these experiments {{in order to understand}} what, if any, experimental model they give rise to. It scrutinizes in particular: a) the role of the camera’s mechanical body (multiple references to the camera as device with mechanical senses will be studied), b) the position of the scientist’s body in the experimental field and its role in the costruction of the theory (the training of the observer’s/scientist’s senses), c) the preparation of the body of the subjects to be analyzed (before the experiments) and the way his/her senses were taken into account in the experimental field (during the experiments).. Secondly and consequently, the paper aims to show how all these regulatory norms serve and enable a specific economy of the body in two interconnected senses: a) economy as a form of reduction. The paper analyzes different ways the body inside the experimental field is isolated/deleted depending on whether it is the scientist’s body, the subject’s body under analysis or the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> It will lead to a first meaning of absence of senses, that is linked to an automatization of them. b) economy as a system of efficiency. Beginning from Marcel Mauss’s notion of “techniques du corps” as a general theoretical framework as well as specific examples of disciplining effects on individuals, this paper seeks to outline the historical role played by the abovementioned studies of the body in developing a specific concept of efficiency and its relationship with work. It will lead to a second meaning of absence of senses, that it is intertwined to the first and linked to the relationships between the processes of depersonalization and the processes of the spectacle. Finally, some comparisons with other earlier experimental protocols (especially with the works by Étienne-Jules Marey and Eadweard Muybridge) and an analysis of the circulation that the pictures by the Gilbreths had in the popular media will be briefly traced...|$|E
