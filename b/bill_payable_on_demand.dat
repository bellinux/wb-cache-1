25|$|Gradually the goldsmiths {{began to}} lend {{the money out}} {{on behalf of the}} depositor, which led to the {{development}} of modern banking practices; promissory notes (which evolved into banknotes) were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith. The goldsmith paid interest on these deposits. Since the promissory notes were <b>payable</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand,</b> and the advances (loans) to the goldsmith's customers were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of fractional reserve banking. The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay, allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of default.

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of the development of commercial banking—defined as taking deposits <b>payable</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> and originating loans to private and corporate customers—from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. Two characteristics are underlined: state regulation, primarily dictated by concerns about banks’ position as deposit takers; and banks’ role in the financing of industry and more generally in economic growth including their assigned responsibility. The changing nature of these two features has shaped the development of commercial banks since the onset of industrialization. In all countries, with the exception of England, commercial banks developed into some kind of universal bank {{in the course of the}} nineteenth century. This converging movement ended in the interwar years, when in many countries commercial banks were separated from investment banks.

5000|$|In {{government}} finance, {{a warrant}} is a written {{order to pay}} that instructs a federal, state, or county government treasurer to pay the warrant holder <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> or after a maturity date. Such warrants look like checks and clear through the banking system like checks, but are not drawn against cleared funds in a checking account (demand deposit account). Instead they may be drawn against [...] "available funds" [...] or [...] "out of fund 0027" [...] so that the issuer can collect interest on the float or delay redemption. If the warrant is conditional on funds being available, the warrant is not a negotiable debt instrument. In the U.S., warrants are issued by government entities such as the military and state and county governments. Warrants are issued for payroll to individual employees, accounts payable to vendors, to local governments, to taxpayers receiving tax refunds, to recipients of unemployment benefits, and to owners of unclaimed money. A warrant differs from a check in that the warrant is not drawn on a checking account, is not necessarily <b>payable</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand,</b> {{and may not be}} negotiable.|$|R
50|$|Coin then {{defined the}} three main forms of credit: credit, checks and bonds. Coin defined credit as paper bills and token money redeemable in primary money, checks as forms of paper <b>payable</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand,</b> and bonds as credit payable {{at some point in}} the future. Ideally, one would prefer to keep the amount of the three forms of credit as same as the amount of primary money backing them up. Coin {{explained}} that during a period of prosperity, more and more businessmen and entrepreneurs took debts to further investments in their businesses. When too much of the credit money was purchased compared to the available supply of redemption money, this created a loss of confidence in the banks as more and more buyers run to the bank to collect their money and debt payments before the banks run out of money. This, combined with the halved supply of primary money from silver losing its free coinage, made new debt all the riskier.|$|R
