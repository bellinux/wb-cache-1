Repsol at the time said the area could ultimately produce 100,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>a</b> day, which would meet 10 percent of Spain's energy needs. However, the analysis of samples obtained did not show the necessary volume nor quality to consider future extraction, and the project was scrapped.|$|E

2500|$|Up {{until the}} early 1950s, coal had been the {{commodity}} mined in the area. [...] In the late 40's, a blizzard in the Alberta foothills pushed the seismic operations eastward to Stettler.

[...] That exploration resulted in the Big Valley No. 7 discovery well the following year, located [...] south of Big Valley, Alberta. [...] This well was completed in September 1950. [...] Once developed, the Fenn-Big Valley field covered an area of 78.2 hectares (30.2 square miles). [...] This field produced over 51 million cubic metres (321 million barrels) of oil and over 2.4 billion cubic metres (85 billion cubic feet) of solution gas. [...] Small amounts of oil and gas remain to be produced from this field. [...] The oil and gas formation lies 1660 metres (5,445ft) {{below the surface of the}} ground.

50|$|In the oil industry, {{following}} {{the definition of}} the American Petroleum Institute, <b>a</b> standard <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> is often taken to mean the amount <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> that at <b>a</b> standard pressure (14.696 psi) and temperature (60 F) would occupy a volume of exactly 1 bbl. This standard <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> will occupy <b>a</b> different volume at different pressures and temperatures. A standard barrel in this context is thus not simply a measure of volume, but of volume under specific conditions. The task of converting this standard <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> to <b>a</b> standard cubic metre <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> is {{complicated by the fact that}} the standard cubic metre is defined by the American Petroleum Institute to mean the amount <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> that at 101.325 kPa and 15 C occupies 1 cubic metre. The fact that the conditions are not exactly the same means that an exact conversion is impossible unless the exact expansion coefficient of the crude is known, and this will vary from one crude oil to another.|$|R

However, the major difference between the versions was the Mitsubishi air-cooled 6-cylinder diesel engine, which had several advantages: reduced vulnerability to fire of a gas engine; better fuel economy; greater torque at lower revolutions. A diesel engine was also preferred by the Japanese Army because more diesel fuel than gasoline could be produced per <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> <b>A</b> total <b>of</b> 291 Otsu tanks were produced.
