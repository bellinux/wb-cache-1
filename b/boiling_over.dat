5|$|Most of {{the pottery}} found in 9th century pueblos was sized for {{individuals}} or small families, but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the 13th century, many larger, feast–sized vessels were produced. Corrugated decorations appear on Mesa Verde grey wares after 700, and by 1000 entire vessels were crafted in this way. The technique created a rough exterior surface that {{was easier to}} hold on to than regular grey wares, which were smooth. By the 11th century these corrugated vessels, which dissipated heat more efficiently than smoother ones, had largely replaced the older style, whose tendency to retain heat made them prone to <b>boiling</b> <b>over.</b> Corrugation likely developed as ancient potters attempted to mimic the visual properties of coiled basketry. Corrugated wares were made using clay from formations other than Menefee, which suggests that ancient potters selected different clays for different styles. Potters also selected clays and altered firing conditions to achieve specific colors. Under normal conditions, pots made of Mancos shale turned grey when fired, and those made of Morrison Formation clay turned white. Clays from southeastern Utah turned red when fired in a high-oxygen environment.|$|E

The first battles of the war were fought in Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts, later leading to the Siege of Boston by continental troops.

500|$|A stagecoach road existed {{into the}} 19th century that {{passed through the}} {{mountains}} east of San Diego. Construction was discussed as early as 1911, with The San Diego Union and Daily Bee saying that it [...] "will {{be one of the}} best in the system." [...] Well before the freeway was constructed, the automobile road through the mountains east of San Diego was narrow and wound through the mountains; it was officially dedicated in 1912. This trip was known to take up to four hours, and frequently resulted in the radiator <b>boiling</b> <b>over,</b> flat tires, or broken fan belts; recent inclement weather would result in cars becoming mired in the mud. But meanwhile, Colonel Ed Fletcher declared the road a [...] "success", and indicated his belief that a concrete road from San Diego to Yuma would soon follow, responding to criticism that a road from Los Angeles to Brawley should have been built.|$|E
500|$|Cattle ranchers {{had moved}} into the territories {{within a year of}} the police arriving, {{initially}} clustering around the police posts for protection. The government began to promote the development of the large ranches during the 1870s and early 1880s, enclosing land up to [...] in size and excluding smaller farmers. The police had close links to the ranch owners, and many of the first recruits had gone on to become ranchers themselves after leaving the force. Illegal squatting by poorer settlers started to become a problem, however, <b>boiling</b> <b>over</b> into open disputes during the 1890s, and the mounted police were deployed to evict them. The task was unpopular among the force, but it grudgingly complied until government policy towards the smaller settlers finally changed in 1896. The police provided a range of other services for the new ranches, carrying out operations along the border to prevent cattle crossing north into the Canadian ranches, running quarantine schemes and helping with veterinary issues.|$|E

Sophia entered into a relationship with her father's chief equerry, Major-General Thomas Garth, a man thirty-three years her senior. He had a large purple birthmark on his face, causing Sophia's sister Mary to refer to him as [...] "the purple light of love" [...] and courtier and diarist Charles Greville to call him a [...] "hideous old devil". Despite this, one lady-in-waiting noted [...] "the princess was so violently {{in love with him}} that everyone saw it. She could not contain herself in his presence." [...] Greville wrote about Sophia and her sisters' affairs in a diary entry, [...] "women fall in love with anything – and opportunity and the accidents of the passions are of more importance than any positive merits of mind or of body... were secluded from the world, mixing with few people – their passions <b>boiling</b> <b>over</b> and ready to {{fall into the hands of}} the first man whom circumstances enabled to get at them." ...|$|E

Before the freeway was constructed, the automobile road through the mountains east of San Diego was narrow and wound through the mountains; it was officially dedicated in 1912. This trip was known to take up to four hours, and frequently resulted in the radiator <b>boiling</b> <b>over,</b> flat tires, or broken fan belts; inclement weather would result in cars becoming mired in the mud. The road was paved in 1926, and was open by 1927; remnants of this road were still present in the late 20th century. Another road {{was built in the}} early 1930s, to remove curves and widen the lanes. This was a two-lane road that still had many switchbacks, with one popularly known as [...] "Dead Man's Curve". Construction of I-8 took place atop much of the roadbed of the highway from the early 1930s. The delay in extending a road to San Diego caused increased development in Los Angeles and resulted in that city becoming the trade and population center of Southern California, according to the San Diego Union.|$|E
500|$|Many basic {{variations}} of cooking utensils available today, such as frying pans, pots, kettles, and waffle irons, already existed, {{although they were}} often too expensive for poorer households. Other tools more specific to cooking over an open fire were spits of various sizes, and material for skewering anything from delicate quails to whole oxen. There were also cranes with adjustable hooks so that pots and cauldrons could easily be swung away from the fire {{to keep them from}} burning or <b>boiling</b> <b>over.</b> Utensils were often held directly over the fire or placed into embers on tripods. To assist the cook there were also assorted knives, stirring spoons, ladles and graters. In wealthy households {{one of the most common}} tools was the mortar and sieve cloth, since many medieval recipes called for food to be finely chopped, mashed, strained and seasoned either before or after cooking. This was based on a belief among physicians that the finer the consistency of food, the more effectively the body would absorb the nourishment. It also gave skilled cooks the opportunity to elaborately shape the results. Fine-textured food was also associated with wealth; for example, finely milled flour was expensive, while the bread of commoners was typically brown and coarse. A typical procedure was farcing (from the Latin farcio, [...] "to cram"), to skin and dress an animal, grind up the meat and mix it with spices and other ingredients and then return it into its own skin, or mold it into the shape of a completely different animal.|$|E

The beans are cooked by steadily <b>boiling</b> <b>over</b> a sustained period of time. Similar to Egypt, the cooked beans are mashed, and prepared by adding salt and pepper. For additional flavour, sesame oil is added along with a sprinkling of jibna ("feta" [...] cheese) on top. The dish is then eaten with bread and is sometimes refereed to as ful medames.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{definition}} {{derives from}} Kerikeri te ana wai — [...] "the churning or <b>boiling</b> <b>over</b> of the waters". That would have aptly described the freshwater river tumbling into the salt {{water over the}} falls which were then higher (being blasted early in the 1900s to accommodate a bridge). However, some Māori say it derives from hukerikeri which means [...] "bubbling up", {{and there is a}} sad reasoning behind this. Hongi Hika, a famous or infamous chief depending on whether one fought with or against him, is reputed to have fathered the child of a captured slave at Kororipo Pā. As this was unacceptable to the tribe, the baby was placed in the water to drown but persistently rose to the surface, hence the [...] "bubbling up".|$|E

2500|$|A {{widely used}} method for heat {{sterilization}} is the [...] autoclave, sometimes called a converter or steam sterilizer. Autoclaves use steam heated to 121-134°C under pressure. To achieve sterility, {{the article is}} placed in a chamber and heated by injected steam until the article reaches a time and temperature setpoint. [...] Almost all the air {{is removed from the}} chamber, because air is undesired in the moist heat sterilization process (this is one trait that differ from a typical pressure cooker used for food cooking). The article is held at the temperature setpoint {{for a period of time}} which varies depending on what bioburden is present on the article being sterilized and its resistance (D-value) to steam sterilization. A general cycle would be anywhere between 3 and 15 minutes, (depending on the generated heat) at 121°C at 100 kPa, which is sufficient to provide a sterility assurance level of 10−4 for a product with a bioburden of 106 and a D-value of 2.0 minutes. Following sterilization, liquids in a pressurized autoclave must be cooled slowly to avoid <b>boiling</b> <b>over</b> when the pressure is released. This may be achieved by gradually depressurizing the sterilization chamber and allowing liquids to evaporate under a negative pressure, while cooling the contents.|$|E
