40|$|The {{changes in}} {{relative}} participation of pathways of glucose catabolism in red <b>beet</b> <b>slices</b> during washing {{have been examined}} using specifically 14 C labeled glucoses. Washing of these slices brings about an increase in participation of the pentose phosphate pathway. The composition of the washing medium influences slightly the extent of change in pathway participation. The activity level of certain enzymes participating {{in the initial stages}} of glucose catabolism has been measured in fresh and washed <b>beet</b> <b>slices.</b> Fresh slices which barely metabolized gluconate were found to have very little 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity. Washing brings about a dramatic increase in 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity and this increase was accompanied by a marked increase in the ability of the slices to metabolize gluconate. In red <b>beet</b> <b>slices</b> the TPNH generated via pentose phosphate pathway appears to be utilized for biosynthetic reductions rather than as respiratory substrate...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{rate of the}} C¹⁴ 0 ₂ {{release from}} glucose, {{specifically}} labeled with C¹⁴ at 1, 2, 3 + 4, and positions, was used to study the relative participation of pathways of glucose catabolism in red <b>beet</b> <b>slices.</b> Evidence was obtained which indicated that in mature red beets glucose was catabolized mainly via glycolysis-tricarboxylic acid cycle (EMP-TCAC). Approximately 15 - 22 {{percent of the total}} glucose catabolized in fresh slices appeared to be mediated via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Older beet roots were found to have more PPP activity than young <b>beet</b> root <b>slices.</b> When red <b>beet</b> <b>slices</b> were washed in either demineralized distilled water or 0. 01 M KH₂PO₄ solution by shaking in a gyratory shaker, the relative participation of the PPP increased with the duration of washing. Increase in the relative participation of the PPP was more in the slices washed in KH₂PO₄ solution than in water alone. However, changes in the relative participation of pathways were less marked with red <b>beet</b> <b>slices</b> than with other storage tissues as reported by other workers, The TCAC was active in both fresh and washed <b>beet</b> <b>slices.</b> C¹⁴ release from specifically labeled glucose by fresh <b>beet</b> <b>slices</b> was very strongly inhibited by 0. 05 M malonate, whereas much less inhibition was found inwashed slices. This strongly suggests TCAC participation in the fresh slices. Enzyme assays with crude extracts prepared from red <b>beet</b> <b>slices</b> indicated that the following enzyme activity changes occurred during a 24 -hour washing period. Glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase (TPN) slightly increased in activity; TPN reduction and malic dehydrogenase (TPN) activities slightly decreased; TPNH oxidizing power increased significantly; 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity increased 3 - 5 fold. The increase in TPNH oxidizing power {{may play a role in}} increasing the relative participation of PPP, but the most marked increase was found in 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity and the rate of gluconate utilization. Washing periods longer than two days caused a marked decrease in glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and triose phosphate dehydrogenase activities. Experiments with glucose specifically labeled with H³ indicated that the TPNH produced by the PPP was utilized for biosynthetic purposes rather than as a respiratory substrate. Metabolic changes of slices aged under moist conditions in petri dishes were also examined. The rate of oxygen uptake increased 3 - 5 times in 20 - 24 hours. O₂ uptake by fresh slices was inhibited 60 - 70 percent by 8 x 10 ⁻⁵M HCN. The sensitivity of respiration to HCN decreased rather rapidly during aging and resulted in a cyanide stimulation (about 30 percent) of respiration in about 10 - 12 hours. After about 36 hours of aging, cyanide sensitivity began to reappear. The rates of C¹⁴ release from specifically labeled glucose by fresh and aged red <b>beet</b> <b>slices</b> showed that both the PPP and the EMPTCAC were stimulated by aging. Preferential increase in PPP participation was indicated to be very small, if any. Release of C¹⁴ O₂ from specifically labeled acetate, succinate, aspartate and glutonate showed TCAC activity in both fresh and aged slices. Glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity doubled and 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity increased by about 300 - 400 percent as a result of aging for 36 hours, The rate of gluconate utilization increased 10 - 20 times by aging over that of fresh slices. The rate of uptake and utilization of organic acids, amino acids and glucose increased several fold due to 24 -hours of aging. Biosynthetic activities such as protein synthesis of these tissues were also indicated to be increased during aging. From these studies, it does not seem justifiable to explain age induced respiration as being due to a release of inhibition on TCAO activity or as preferential increase in PPP activity, but it seems to be a stimulation of the activity of the total metabolic machinery probably caused by removal of a metabolic block which is still not understood...|$|R

40|$|Plantains are wasted due to {{deterioration}} when {{dumped in}} villages and towns {{during the peak}} of harvest. Therefore, {{it is necessary that}} plantains are processed into chips for preservation and availability throughout the year. Modern methods of slicing have greatly improved production rate and reduces slicing time. The main objective {{of this study was to}} modify an existing plantain <b>slicing</b> <b>machine</b> so as to optimize its efficiency at low cost, reduce total time of slicing and produce hygienic and quality chips. The improvement on the design of the existing <b>slicing</b> <b>machine</b> was achieved through proper focus on the capacity, materials and other design criteria for various component parts. The slicer consists of cutting disc, cutting chamber, feeding chute, the main frame and power transmitting unit. The result of the improvement on the design of this <b>slicing</b> <b>machine</b> showed that maintenance cost is cheap, slicing time of plantain chips was reduced, operation of the machine does not require special skill, the machine is easy and safe to operate, it is free of noise and vibration,the slicing method is continuous with two slicing blades provided inside the cutting chamber and energy for loading and unloading is reduced since feeding chute and collecting bucket are provided.

40|$|We {{consider}} slicing {{of extended}} finite state machines. These may be non- deterministic and hence standard techniques for slicing, developed for control flow graphs, are not immediately applicable.

In the other direction, we cannot hope for a perfect simulation, but demand that for each observable step by the <b>sliced</b> <b>machine,</b> either the original machine simulates it or (i) it gets stuck, or (ii) it loops. To ensure correctness, it suffices to demand that the set of transitions in the slice satisfies two conditions: it must be closed under the well-known notion of data dependence, and it must have the “weak commitment ” property highlighted by Danicic et al. If the slice also has the “strong commitment ” property, the case (ii) above can be ruled out, meaning that the original machine will simulate the <b>sliced</b> <b>machine</b> except that it may get stuck. We prove that for each of the properties “weak commitment ” and “strong com- mitment”, there exists a least set with that property; we also give algorithms to compute that least set...|$|R
