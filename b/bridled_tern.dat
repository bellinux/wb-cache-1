25|$|When {{numbers of}} {{individuals}} {{are taken into}} account, the tropical birds overwhelmingly dominate. The islands {{are one of the}} most important breeding sites for tropical seabirds in Australia and have been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). They contain by far the largest colonies of wedge-tailed shearwater in the eastern Indian Ocean, with over a million breeding pairs recorded there in 1994. They also contain Western Australia's only breeding colonies of the lesser noddy, and the largest colonies in Western Australia of the little shearwater, white-faced storm petrel, common noddy, Caspian tern, crested tern, roseate tern and fairy tern. In addition, they contain important breeding areas for the Pacific reef heron, Pacific gull, <b>bridled</b> <b>tern,</b> white-bellied sea eagle and osprey.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bridled</b> <b>tern</b> {{is known}} to inhabit the island with 3000-4000 pairs being {{estimated}} from a survey in 1996.|$|E

5000|$|The island {{group has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports large numbers of breeding <b>bridled</b> <b>terns</b> as well as smaller numbers of other tern species. [...] Estimated numbers of <b>bridled</b> <b>terns</b> nesting in the four years between 1993-1999 when surveys were made varied from 5000 to 50,000. Roseate and black-naped terns nest irregularly on the northern islets while black-naped, <b>bridled</b> and roseate <b>terns</b> have been recorded nesting on Dudley Island.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bridled</b> <b>terns</b> mostly roost {{on three}} {{uninhabited}} islands, Twins Reef (雙子礁)、Sole Cap (獨角帽), and Lotus Reef (芙蓉礁) in Siyin..|$|R
50|$|The island {{supports}} dry forest. It is {{an important}} breeding site for seabirds such as red-billed tropicbird, Audubon's shearwater, brown booby, brown noddy, sooty and <b>bridled</b> <b>terns.</b> A few pairs of white-tailed tropicbirds are also nesting here.|$|R
5000|$|Hicks Island is {{also part}} of the Cape York to Cape Grenville Islands Important Bird Area. [...] The island is {{inhabited}} by species such as the pied imperial-pigeon, <b>bridled</b> <b>tern,</b> roseate tern and lesser crested tern.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>bridled</b> <b>tern</b> (Onychoprion anaethetus) [...] is a seabird of {{the family}} Laridae. It is a bird of the {{tropical}} oceans. The scientific name is from Ancient Greek.

50|$|Close to Maningrida is Haul Round Island {{which has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area because of its seabird breeding colony - {{one of the largest in}} the Northern Territory.

5000|$|The {{archipelago}} {{has been}} identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it regularly supports over 1% of the world populations of crested and <b>bridled</b> <b>terns.</b> [...] Other seabirds recorded as having bred on the islands include wedge-tailed shearwaters, pied cormorants, roseate, lesser crested and Caspian terns, and silver gulls.|$|R
50|$|Many other waterbirds {{breed in}} colonies on the floodplain, {{especially}} egrets, herons and spoonbills, while the mudflats {{are used by}} flocks of migratory waders in summer. Wader species using the site in large numbers include black-tailed godwits, lesser sand plovers and red-necked stints.

50|$|Three of {{the four}} species are tropical, and one has a sub-polar {{breeding}} range. The sooty tern has a pan-tropical distribution; the <b>bridled</b> <b>tern</b> also breeds across the Tropical Atlantic and Indian Ocean but in the central Pacific it is replaced by the spectacled tern. The Aleutian tern breeds around Alaska and Siberia but winters in the tropics around South East Asia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{island is}} known for its rich fish life.And Red-footed booby and sooty tern used to breed but are now extinct. Brown noddy and white-tailed tropicbird still breed while {{hundreds}} of lesser noddy and <b>bridled</b> <b>tern</b> roost at night. Barn owls were introduced in 1949 but died out in 1951-1952. Madagascar fody also breed. A year-long turtle study conducted in 1998 demonstrated Platte to have significant populations of some 40 female hawksbills nesting annually ...|$|E
5000|$|Its {{spread among}} Australian islands {{in recent decades}} {{is thought to be}} {{reducing}} biodiversity, soil retention, and seabird habitat.

50|$|Cemlyn has {{attracted}} a number of vagrant birds. It is most famous among twitchers as the site where a <b>bridled</b> <b>tern</b> spent several weeks in July 1988, and where the similarly rare (in a British context) sooty tern was present on and off in July 2005. Both species had at these times been seen by {{only a very small}} number of birders in Britain. Also at Cemlyn in 2005 were an American golden plover in May and a Terek sandpiper in June.

50|$|This {{is a large}} tern, {{similar in}} size to the Sandwich tern (Thalasseus sandvicensis) at 33 - 36 cm long with an 82 - 94 cm wingspan.

Juvenile Sooty Terns are scaly grey above and below. The Sooty Tern is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any tern apart from the similarly dark-backed but smaller <b>bridled</b> <b>tern</b> (O. anaethetus). It is darker-backed than that species, and has a broader white forehead and no pale neck collar.|$|E
50|$|The islands {{have been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because they support over 1% of the world populations of fairy and roseate terns, and of sooty oystercatchers.

Birds found here include the Torresian imperial-pigeon (estimated at over 40,000), <b>bridled</b> <b>terns,</b> black-naped terns, roseate terns and little terns. The beach stone-curlew also makes North Brook Island its home.|$|R
