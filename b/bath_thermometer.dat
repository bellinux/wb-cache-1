Each liquid was then {{placed in a}} tube, which was allowed to float in a water <b>bath,</b> containing a <b>thermometer</b> which indicated a temperature of 38o to 40o Cent. Into each, a quantity of unboiled fibrin was introduced, and the whole allowed to stand for four hours, the temperature being maintained during the whole time, and care being taken that each contained throughout an excess of fibrin. At {{the end of the}} period each liquid was filtered. Of the filtrate, which of course contained as much of the fibrin as had been digested during the four hours, [page 90] 10 cub. cent. were measured out and evaporated, and dried at 110o as before.

The ultrasonicated colored aluminum pigment {{was transferred to}} a four-necked round bottom flask with a reflux condenser and a nitrogen gas in-let/out-let in a water <b>bath</b> equipped with <b>thermometer</b> (60  °C) with continuous stirring at 300  r/m. 0.3  g each of methyl methacrylate, 1, 6 -hexanediol diacrylate, styrene were added drop by drop over 1  h. 0.04  g of polymerization initiator (AIBN) was added thereunto drop by drop, and the temperature was raised to 85  °C with continuous stirring at 450  r/m for 20  h. The mixture was allowed to {{cool to room temperature}} and then centrifuged at 12, 000  r/min for 10  min. The sediment was washed three times with methanol to remove the unreacted monomers and then dried at room temperature under vacuum to obtain polymer-encapsulated PGAP.|$|R
60|$|Jack's hobby was {{athletic}} sports, for he {{was bent}} on having a strong and active body for his happy little soul to live and enjoy itself in. So a severe simplicity reigned in his apartment; in summer, especially, for then his floor was bare, his windows were uncurtained, and the chairs uncushioned, the bed being as narrow and hard as Napoleon's. The only ornaments were dumbbells, whips, bats, rods, skates, boxing-gloves, a big bath-pan and a small library, consisting chiefly of books on games, horses, health, hunting, and travels. In winter his mother made things more comfortable by introducing rugs, curtains, and a fire. Jack, also, relented slightly in the severity of his training, occasionally indulging in the national buckwheat cake, instead of the prescribed oatmeal porridge, for breakfast, omitting his cold <b>bath</b> when the <b>thermometer</b> was below zero, and dancing at night, instead of running a given distance by day.|$|R
40|$|Thermochromic liquid {{crystals}}, or TLCs, are a type {{of liquid}} crystals that react to changes in temperature by changing color. The Hallcrest/NASA collaboration involved {{development of a new}} way to visualize boundary layer transition in flight and in wind tunnel testing of aircraft wing and body surfaces. TLCs offered a new and potentially better method of visualizing the boundary layer transition in flight. Hallcrest provided a liquid crystal formulation technique that afforded great control over the sensitivity of the liquid crystals to varying conditions. Method is of great use to industry, government and universities for aerodynamic and hydrodynamic testing. Company's principal line is temperature indicating devices for industrial use, such as non-destructive testing and flaw detection in electric/electronic systems, medical application, such as diagnostic systems, for retail sale, such as room, refrigerator, baby <b>bath</b> and aquarium <b>thermometers,</b> and for advertising and promotion specials. Additionally, Hallcrest manufactures TLC mixtures for cosmetic applications, and liquid crystal battery tester for Duracell batteries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the thermoelectric response of a dissipative quantum dot heat engine {{based on the}} Anderson-Holstein model in two relevant operating limits: (i) when the dot phonon modes are out of equilibrium, and (ii) when the dot phonon modes are strongly coupled to a heat bath. In the first case, {{a detailed analysis of}} the physics related to the interplay between the quantum dot level quantization, the on-site Coulomb interaction and the electron-phonon coupling on the thermoelectric performance reveals that an n-type heat engine performs better than a p-type heat engine. In the second case, with the aid of the dot temperature estimated by incorporating a <b>thermometer</b> <b>bath,</b> it is shown that the dot temperature deviates from the bath temperature as electron-phonon interaction becomes stronger. Consequently, it is demonstrated that the dot temperature controls the direction of phonon heat currents, thereby influencing the thermoelectric performance. Finally, the conditions on the maximum efficiency with varying phonon couplings between the dot and all the other macroscopic bodies are analyzed in order to reveal the nature of the optimum junction.
