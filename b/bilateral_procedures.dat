5000|$|Gustatory {{sweating}} or Frey's {{syndrome is}} another presentation of autonomic neuropathy. [...] Gustatory sweating is brought on while eating, thinking or talking about food {{that produces a}} strong salivary stimulus. It is thought that ANS fibres to salivary glands have become connected in error with the sweat glands after nerve regeneration. Apart from sweating in the anhidriotic area of the body, it can produce flushing, goosebumps, drop of body temperature - vasoconstriction and paresthesia. Aberrant gustatory sweating follows up to 73% of surgical sympathectomies and is particularly common after <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedures.</b> Facial sweating during salivation has also been described in diabetes mellitus, cluster headache, following chorda tympani injury, and following facial herpes zoster.|$|E
5000|$|Thalamotomy (θάλαμος {{thalamus}} lit. [...] "chamber"; τομή tomē [...] "cut, slice") is {{a surgical}} procedure {{in which an}} opening is made into the thalamus {{in order to improve}} the overall brain function in patients. First introduced in the 1950s, it is primarily effective for tremors such as those associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), where a selected portion of the thalamus is surgically destroyed (ablated). Neurosurgeons use specialized equipment to precisely locate an area of the thalamus, usually choosing to work on only one side (the side opposite that of the worst tremors). <b>Bilateral</b> <b>procedures</b> are poorly tolerated because of increased complication and risk, including vision and speech problems. The positive effects on tremors are immediate. Other less destructive procedures are sometimes preferred, such as subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS), since this procedure can also improve tremors and other symptoms of PD.|$|E

40|$|Factors {{responsible}} for major complications following thyroid surgery in 598 patients were studied. Patients with non toxic multinodular goiter involving both lobes of thyroid constituted the maximum bulk subjected to thyroidectomy. The most frequent procedure was bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy.

Temporary vocal cord palsy was observed in 7 patients whereas one patient subjected to total thyroidectomy with neck dissection for papillary carcinoma of thyroid developed permanent right vocal cord palsy. Temporary parathyroid insufficiency was seen in 51 patients and one patient developed permanent hypoparathyroidism.

30|$|One {{hundred and}} six {{patients}} (149 SCFEs) {{were included in}} the study.

Thirty-six hips were fixed on a fracture table and 113 on a radiolucent table. Eighty-nine percent (134) of hips had slips that were classified as stable, whereas 10 % (15) were unstable. Of the 134 hips with stable SCFE, 101 (75 %) were treated on a radiolucent table and 33 (25 %) on a fracture table. Of the 15 unstable hips, 12 (80 %) were treated on a radiolucent table and three (20 %) were treated on a fracture table. There were 52 unilaterally involved left and 41 right SCFEs. Twenty-six of these unilateral procedures were done on a fracture table and 67 on a radiolucent table.

30|$|The {{issue of}} <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedures</b> is {{controversial}} since {{the presence of}} two procedures in one patient violates the assumption of independent observations on which many statistical tests rely [60]. However, other authors have discussed this and found that inclusion of <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedures</b> did not alter the results [61, 62]. In a recent study from the Finnish Arthroplasty Register, 27 % of the cases analyzed were bilateral cases, and inclusion of bilateral cases in the analysis was considered appropriate, even though the statistical technique (Cox regression) formally requires independent observations. In out study, 21 % of the cases were bilateral. We did find statistically significant differences in preoperative BMI, {{which raises the question}} of whether other unknown confounders might influence the results. However, the issue of bilaterality was not addressed in the study protocol. The presence of an arthroplasty in the contralateral hip was not an exclusion criterion for the study, nor was there any criterion excluding patients with poor function of the contralateral hip. For these reasons, we find it justified to include the patients who had two arthroplasties during the study and treat them as independent cases.|$|E

MethodsData were prospectively collected for all patients undergoing EVLA for varicose veins in our unit including clinical outcomes (CEAP classification) and post-operative duplex. Results 624 EVLA procedures were performed from April 2004 to February 2009. There were 527 LSV EVLA cases, 449 of which were for the above-knee segment only. There were 94 SSV EVLA cases and 3 patients needed LSV EVLA on the same leg at the same time. 84 % were done under general anesthetic including 126 patients who underwent <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedures</b> at the same session.

We report our {{results of a}} sacroplasty technique, using CT for needle placement and fluoroscopy to monitor the polymethylmethacrylate injection in a group of patients with sacral insufficiency fractures. METHODS: All patients had a history of chronic back pain and had an osteoporotic sacral insufficiency fracture documented by imaging before the procedure. With the patient under conscious sedation, a bone biopsy needle was placed under CT guidance; the patient was then transferred to the fluoroscopy suite, where a polymethylmethacrylate mixture was injected into the sacrum under real-time fluoros-copy. Clinical outcome was assessed by telephone. RESULTS: The procedure was performed on 13 female patients with an average age of 76 years (range, 60 – 88 years). A <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedure</b> was performed in 11 patients and a unilateral procedure was performed in 2 patients. An average of 4. 1 mL of cement was injected for each treatment.

40|$|Summary Introduction: Varicocele {{disease is}} {{well-known}} cause of infertility in men. The presence of spermatic varices veins create {{a hostile environment}} to spermatogenesis. It results in reduced quality of the sperm production {{and in some cases}} can determine a total absence of sperm. The varicocelectomy procedure in patients with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) can raise the rates of sperm in the semen analysis. A positive rate for sperm, even if very low, may be sufficient to enable the capture of sperm intended for in-vitro fertilization without the use of donor sperm. Objetive: To evaluate the raise of sperm in NOA patients with varicocele disease who were submitted to a <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedure</b> to recovery sperm production. Method: We analized the sperm results of 25 NOA patients who undergone to a <b>bilateral</b> varicocelectomy <b>procedure.</b> Results: From a total of 25 patients, three (12 %) recovered sperm count four months after procedure. One year after the procedure, five (20 %) patients recovered sperm production.

40|$|Because {{there are}} no {{definitive}} guidelines for performing right heart catheterizations or controlled clinical trials demonstrating medical benefit, the value and necessity of performing routine right heart catheterizations for coronary artery disease have been questioned. This Texas Medical Foundation Health Care Quality Improvement Program project was designed to ensure medical necessity and proper documentation of right heart catheterization when performed {{as part of a}} bilateral procedure. Medicare claims data were used to identify Texas facilities where rates of bilateral catheterizations suggested that right heart catheterizations were being performed routinely. Five facilities were found to have rates of <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedures</b> exceeding 70 %. Suggested guidelines for performing right heart catheterizations were prepared by the Texas Medical Association Committee on Cardiovascular Diseases. These guidelines, together with the facility's data on its rate of right heart catheterizations, were presented by the Texas Medical Foundation to the staff of each facility. They were asked to examine their individual facility's procedures for ensuring medical necessity and to develop and implement process improvement plans. Medicare claims data were analyzed to determine the rates of bilateral catheterizations before and after the plans were instituted. The statewide rate of <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedures</b> decreased from 27. 2 % to 21. 3 % (p < 0. 005). Rate reductions for 4 facilities implementing improvement plans were statistically significant (p < 0. 001) : at the 1 st facility, the rate decreased from 74. 3 % to 25. 0 %; at the 2 nd, from 85. 0 % to 21. 0 %; at the 3 rd, from 76. 7 % to 17. 7 %; and at the 4 th facility, from 85. 4 % to 42. 9 %. The rate for the facility not implementing an improvement plan increased from 86. 4 % to 89. 1 %.

40|$|AbstractBoth {{unilateral}} {{and bilateral}} lung volume reduction procedures are being advocated {{for treatment of}} severe, generalized emphysema. We analyzed the results of 166 consecutive patients who underwent unilateral (n = 87) or bilateral (n = 79) thoracoscopic stapled lung volume reductions to help define the role for these procedures. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in the operative mortality (3. 5 % vs 2. 5 %), mean length of stay (11. 4 ± 1 vs 10. 9 ± 1 days), or morbidity for the unilateral and bilateral groups, respectively (p not significant for all variables). Oxygen dependence was eliminated in 18 (36 %) of 50 patients who had unilateral procedures and 30 (68 %) of 44 of those who had <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedures</b> (p < 0. 01). Prednisone was eliminated for 38 (54 %) of 51 unilateral-procedure patients, compared with 30 (85 %) of 35 bilateral-procedure patients (p = 0. 02). Overall, <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedures</b> produced a mean improvement in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) of 57 %, compared with 31 % for unilateral reduction procedures (p < 0. 01). Our bilateral staple procedure produced a 72. 8 % mean increase in the FEV 1 for patients who had upper lobe emphysema. Especially compromised patients (age ≥ 75, with preoperative room air Po 2 ≤ 50 mm Hg or FEV 1 ≤ 500 ml) had the same morbidity and operative mortality with unilateral or <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedures,</b> but they had a higher 1 -year mortality (17 % vs 5 %), primarily because of respiratory failure after the unilateral operation (p <. 001). Although unilateral staple lung volume reduction may produce an excellent result in a given patient, the bilateral procedure appears to be the procedure of choice, because it provides better overall results at no increased morbidity or mortality compared with the unilateral procedure. The results of bilateral staple lung volume reduction by thoracoscopy appear to be comparable to those of median sternotomy. (J THORAC CARDIOVASC SURG 1996; 112 : 1331 - 9...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Bilateral total knee {{arthroplasty}} can {{be performed}} either as a staged or simultaneous procedure. We conducted a retrospective comparative study to compare the need for transfusion, the length of procedure, the length of stay, and complications of bilateral simultaneous knee arthroplasty with those of unilateral knee arthroplasty. Sixty-nine patients who underwent bilateral simultaneous knee arthroplasty procedures were compared with a matched control group of 69 patients who underwent unilateral knee arthroplasty. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve {{was used to determine}} optimum cut-off values. Both groups of patients had a similar age and gender distribution, preoperative haemoglobin and ASA scores. Cumulative transfusion episodes were lower in the bilateral group than twice that of the unilateral group. In multivariate analysis the preoperative haemoglobin level and <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedures</b> were independent factors predicting the need for transfusion. The average length of procedure and length of hospital stay in the bilateral group was less than twice than that of the unilateral group. Advanced age and <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedures</b> were independent predictors of prolonged length of stay. A haemoglobin level of 12. 5 g/dL and age of 70 were most suitable cut-off points to predict need for transfusion and occurrence of medical complications respectively. We conclude that bilateral simultaneous knee arthroplasties are safe and cost effective in appropriately selected patients. We recommend avoiding bilateral simultaneous procedures in patients over the age of 70 years and with significant comorbidities...|$|E

30|$|Unless contraindicated, a {{trial of}} non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} medication or oral contraceptives would be a reasonable initial treatment of this condition [9].

If this fails or if the condition recurs, release of the haematosalpinx can be achieved by laparoscopic diathermy to the tubal stump, as in our case.
