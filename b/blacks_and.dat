5|$|Because of the {{existence}} of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> 9% Indians.|$|E

Maxwell also praised Critchlow's development as an artist, judging the comic to be beautifully drawn and coloured with a clear line style.
