The body weight of fish on wheat bran and <b>rice</b> <b>broken</b> was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than those fed blood meal, while the difference between the former two groups was non significant. The total length obtained by the fish averaged 5. 06 ± 0. 03, 5. 05 ± 0. 09 and 4. 96 ± 0. 32 cm on wheat bran, <b>rice</b> <b>broken</b> and blood meal, respectively, the difference being non significant.

Day-old male broiler chicks (Hubbard× Hubbard) were reared on corn-SBM based diet from 1 to 13 days and thereafter birds were fed experimental diets from day 14 to 21. Each diet was fed to 36 birds kept in six replicate cages, each cage had six birds. In cereals, the SIAAD of corn’s amino acid (AA) (90. 1 %) was similar (p> 0. 05) to RB (89. 0 %). Isoleucine (97. 8 %) and lysine (96. 9 %) were highly digestible AA in corn and RB, respectively. Among cereal-by products, WB’s SIAAD (76. 9 %) was same (p> 0. 05) as RP (71. 9 %).

The 12 experimental diets (4 ingredients x 3 samples) were formulated by substituting the corn-soybean meal basal diet with 30 % test ingredients. The acid insoluble ash was added at 1 % of all diets. The 468 day-old male broiler chicks (Hubbard x Hubbard) were reared on basal diet from day 1 to 13 and thereafter experimental diets were offered ad libitum to birds from 14 to 21 days. Each diet was offered to 36 birds, equally distributed to six replicate pens. The basal diet continued to feed the birds of 6 replicates from day 14 to 21. The excreta samples were collected for 3 days, day 19 - 21 and AMEn was calculated. The average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calculated from 14 - 21 days of age. Data regarding ADFI, ADG, FCR and AMEn were analyzed using GLM procedures of SAS while means were partitioned by t-test. The ADFI, ADG, FCR and AMEn remained unaltered (P> 0. 05) by feeding diets based on samples of same feed ingredient except the RP and WB.
