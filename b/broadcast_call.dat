The station {{was the first}} television property to be owned by the Dallas-based company, and also served as the flagship station of its broadcasting division until Belo merged with the Gannett Company in 2013. Four days later on March 21, Belo changed the station's call letters to WFAA-TV to match those of its new radio partner WFAA (570 AM, now KLIF). The WFAA calls reportedly stood for [...] "Working For All Alike," [...] although the radio station later billed itself as the [...] "World's Finest Air Attraction" [...] (the KBTV call letters were later used from 1953 to 1983 by what is now sister station KUSA in Denver, and are currently used by a Fox-affiliated television station in Beaumont).

The voice <b>broadcast</b> <b>call</b> {{does not have a}} {{significant}} labor cost (a $20/hour sales agent consumes $0.33 per minute). Live sales agents are expensive, so telemarketers using live agents will purchase marketing lists that identify good demographic targets. Voice broadcast marketing is cheap enough that marketers may not bother purchasing marketing lists. Voice broadcast marketing only needs live agents for those prospects who express interest in the product by pressing [...] "1" [...] or calling back.|$|E
