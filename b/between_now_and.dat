25|$|The {{time value}} of an option is {{the total value of}} the option, less the {{intrinsic}} value. It partly arises from the uncertainty of future price movements of the underlying. A component of the time value also arises from the unwinding of the discount rate <b>between</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> the expiry date. In the case of a European option, the option cannot be exercised before the expiry date, so it is possible for the time value to be negative; for an American option if the time value is ever negative, you exercise it (ignoring special circumstances such as the security going ex dividend): this yields a boundary condition.|$|E
