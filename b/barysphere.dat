5000|$|Teilhard {{perceived}} a directionality {{in evolution}} along an axis of increasing Complexity/Consciousness. For Teilhard, the noosphere is {{the sphere of}} thought encircling the earth that has emerged through evolution {{as a consequence of}} this growth in complexity / consciousness. The noosphere is therefore as much part of nature as the <b>barysphere,</b> lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. As a result, Teilhard sees the [...] "social phenomenon as the culmination of and not the attenuation of the biological phenomenon." [...] These social phenomena are part of the noosphere and include, for example, legal, educational, religious, research, industrial and technological systems. In this sense, the noosphere emerges through and is constituted by the interaction of human minds. The noosphere thus grows in step with the organization of the human mass in relation to itself as it populates the earth. Teilhard argued the noosphere evolves towards ever greater personalisation, individuation and unification of its elements. He saw the Christian notion of love as being the principal driver of noogenesis. Evolution would culminate in the Omega Point—an apex of thought/consciousness—which he identified with the eschatological return of Christ.|$|E
