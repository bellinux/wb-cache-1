5|$|Hearts {{started the}} match as the {{brighter}} {{of the two}} teams. Rudi Skácel headed wide early on from an Andrew Driver cross. Hearts took the lead through Darren Barr in the 15th minute, scoring from close range. Hearts continued to control the match and Pa Kujabi picked up a booking for fouling Suso Santana. Skácel then doubled Hearts' lead after receiving {{the ball on the}} edge of the area and turning to hit a shot which deflected off James McPake before going in. Hibs then had an opportunity as Kujabi's cross came to Garry O'Connor, but he hit his shot over the bar. McPake then made a goal-line clearance from a Suso shot which had beaten Hibs' keeper Mark Brown. McPake got Hibs back into the game from a corner. Tom Soares' initial delivery was cleared <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the ball back out on the wing and put in a low cross which McPake converted.|$|E

25|$|Bradman was hurried by Gilbert, but {{he somehow}} managed to keep the first ball out. The second was a {{harmless}} one, just outside leg. The third ball was too quick: it screamed past Bradman's bat and thudded into the gloves of Leonard Waterman. The fourth was as fast, and hit Bradman on his underbelly. The impact knocked his bat off, leaving him in agony. It took him time, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> back to his feet. Then came the bouncer, a really quick one. Bradman tried to counterattack, {{but it was too}} quick. The top-edge went up in the air, and Waterman took it easily.|$|E
25|$|Browne was captaining Barbados {{when he got}} {{his first}} call up to the West Indies side in April 1995. He {{struggled}} to hold his place in the side and after 13 Tests he was dropped and didn't return until 3 years later for the ICC Knockout tournament in Kenya. He was soon dropped again, replaced by Ridley Jacobs. His career seemed over <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a surprise recall for the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy in England. He was the hero in the final, his partnership with Ian Bradshaw saw them home at The Oval.

He did not play any more cricket until the 2004/05 {{domestic}} season where he made 610 runs and captined Trinidad and Tobago to Carib Beer Cup triumph. 265 of them came in a single innings, against the Leeward Islands. In July 2005, he was voted Trinidad and Tobago's Cricketer of the Year.

New Zealand had already slumped to 28–4 when Snow was brought on, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> two wickets before lunch, the New Zealand captain John Reid caught behind by Parks and the wicket-keeper Artie Dick clean bowled.

25|$|Zimbabwean all-rounder Sean Ervine {{and veteran}} wicket-keeper Nic Pothas {{made the most}} {{important}} contributions as Hampshire overpowered Glamorgan at Cardiff. Only Michael Powell showed some sort of resistance, scoring 56 in Glamorgan's 214, while Ervine took five for 50 from his ten overs - admittedly mostly tail-enders, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the most wickets. Chris Tremlett also took three for 32. Pothas then notched up the first limited-over century of the Hampshire season, scoring 114 not out off 127 balls and standing tall while Glamorgan's fast bowlers Andrew Davies and Simon Jones made inroads with the ball. England prospect Kevin Pietersen continued his fine form with 69 off 64 balls, including four sixes, as he shared a 130-run partnership with Pothas. Thanks to the quick scoring of Pothas and Pietersen, Hampshire won with nearly 11 overs to spare.|$|E
25|$|Zimbabwean all-rounder Sean Ervine and wicket-keeper Nic Pothas {{made the}} most impact with ball and bat {{respectively}} for Hampshire as they defeated Glamorgan at Cardiff.

25|$|Zimbabwe had a {{good morning}} session on the third day, by their standards, as Laxman was run out for 140 and Yuvraj Singh and Dinesh Karthik were {{dismissed}} in successive overs. Captain Ganguly, however, held together well with the lower order, and he notched up the half-century along with his 5000th Test run before lunch, and India battled out the morning session with no further loss. And in the afternoon session, India's spinners took some beating. Dabengwa and Ewing bowled all but one over of the 37-over long session, despite Irfan Pathan defying the bowlers for 52 and Ganguly nurdling his way to 97 before tea, as Taibu seemed content with Ewing tying down the runs. He did not even do that very efficiently – by tea, his bowling analysis read 38–5–111–0, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a breakthrough three overs into the evening as the Indian captain smashed the ball straight to Dabengwa for 101. By the time, however, the Indian score had soared past 500, and in a frantic 40-ball feast at the end Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan and Anil Kumble combined to add 52 {{for the last two}} wickets.|$|E

25|$|Kishvar Khan {{became the}} second regent of Ibrhaim. In a {{battle against the}} Ahmednagar Sultanate at Dharaseo, the Bijapur army led by him {{captured}} all the artillery and elephants of the enemy army. After the victory, Kishvar Khan ordered other Bijapuri generals to surrender all the captured elephants to him. The elephants were highly valued, and the other generals took great offense. Along with Chand Bibi, they hatched a plan to eliminate Kishvar Khan with help from General Mustafa Khan of Bankapur. Kishvar Khan's spies informed him of the conspiracy, so he sent troops against Mustafa Khan, who was captured and killed in the battle. Chand Bibi challenged Kishvar Khan, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> her imprisoned at the Satara fort and tried to declare himself the king. However, Kishvar Khan had become very unpopular among {{the rest of the}} generals. He was forced to flee when a joint army led by a Habshi general called Ikhlas Khan marched to Bijapur. The army consisted of the forces of three Habshi nobles: Ikhlas Khan, Hamid Khan and Dilavar Khan. Kishvar Khan tried his luck at Ahmednagar unsuccessfully, and then fled to Golconda. He was killed in exile by a relative of Mustafa Khan. Following this, Chand Bibi acted as the regent for a short time.|$|E
25|$|Jeffreys {{was born}} into a middle-class family in Oxford, where he spent the first six years of his life until 1956, when the family moved to Luton, Bedfordshire. He {{attributes}} his curiosity and inventiveness to having been gained from his father, as well as his paternal grandfather, who held a number of patents. When he was eight, his father gave him a chemistry set, which he enhanced {{over the next few years}} with extra chemicals, even including a small bottle of sulfuric acid. He says he liked making small explosions, but an accidental splash of the sulfuric acid caused a burn, which left a permanent scar on his chin (now under his beard). His father also bought him a Victorian-era brass microscope, which he used to examine biological specimens. At about 12, he made a small dissecting kit (including a scalpel, crafted from a flattened pin) which he used to dissect a bumblebee, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> into trouble with his parents when he progressed to dissecting a larger specimen. One Sunday morning he found a dead cat on the road while doing his paper round and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started to dissect it on the dining room table before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell throughout the house after he ruptured its intestines.|$|E

According to various accounts by band members and Fowley, in 1972 Markley had evaded imprisonment and kept a low-profile after an incident involving two underage girls. Markley sporadically contacted his former bandmates; however, Fowley recollected a conversation with Stallings in 1992: [...] "He [...] told me that Bob had been sitting in this rowing boat on a lake near Las Vegas - he was like a recluse. It got loose from its moorings and he drifted off alone for a day and a half. He was already pretty messed up, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> very badly dehydrated.

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1924, the trio {{returned}} to Norway where Asja subsequently left to live with an aunt in Nice and never returned. Although Quisling promised to provide for her well-being, his payments were irregular, and over the coming years he would miss a number of opportunities to visit. Back in Norway, and to his later embarrassment, Quisling found himself drawn into the communist Norwegian labour movement. Among other policies, he fruitlessly advocated a people's militia to protect the country against reactionary attacks, and asked members of the movement whether {{they would like to}} know what information the General Staff had on them, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> no response. Although this brief attachment to the extreme left seems unlikely given Quisling's later political direction, Dahl suggests that, following a conservative childhood, he was by this time [...] "unemployed and dispirited... deeply resentful of the General Staff... in the process of becoming politically more radical." [...] Dahl adds that Quisling's political views at this time could be summarised as [...] "a fusion of socialism and nationalism," [...] with definite sympathies for the Soviet regime in Russia.|$|E
500|$|On August 31, 2003 the Marlins traded Bautista {{and fellow}} minor leaguer Don Levinski to the Baltimore Orioles for veteran Jeff Conine. Before the 2004 season, Baseball America ranked him the Orioles' fifth-best prospect.

He recorded three outs in the first inning he pitched, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> into difficulties and surrendered four runs on three hits before getting removed during his second inning. After a second relief appearance on May 27 (in which he allowed four runs in [...] of an inning) amid a three-game sweep of the Orioles by the Yankees, Bautista was sent back to Bowie. A month later the Orioles traded him to the Kansas City Royals for veteran relief pitcher Jason Grimsley.|$|E

Robinson, however, noticed that Fullmer was {{vulnerable}} to the left hook. Fullmer headed into their May rematch as a 3–1 favorite. In {{the first two rounds}} Robinson followed Fullmer around the ring, however in the third round he changed tactics and made Fullmer come to him. At the start of the fourth round Robinson came out on the attack and stunned Fullmer, and when Fullmer returned with his own punches, Robinson traded with him, as opposed to clinching as he had done in their earlier fight. The fight was fairly even after four rounds. But in the fifth, Robinson was able to win the title back for a fourth time by knocking out Fullmer with a lightning fast, powerful left hook. Boxing critics have referred to the left-hook which knocked out Fullmer as [...] "the perfect punch".*, ibhof.com. Retrieved June 6, 2007.
