500|$|Subsequently, Wainwright paired up with Diane Taylor, {{a former}} Detective Inspector from Greater Manchester Police, {{to create the}} programme, and the {{production}} expanded from Jones and Lindsay's original concept. From Taylor's perspective, police procedurals were often filled with not only technical inaccuracies, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> felt were inaccuracies of how officers behaved, saying: [...] "that's what really irritates me in other dramas– detectives crying over dead bodies and getting drunk senseless. You'd last about two weeks". She said, of her time {{as a police officer}} in comparison to portrayals on television, that [...] "reality is much more interesting. I could pull a thousand cases out of my head people would say would never happen. People need drama because they would not believe the reality".|$|E

500|$|The {{previous}} {{husband of}} a British queen regnant, William of Orange, had become king, refusing {{to take a}} subordinate rank to Mary. William and Mary had exemplified the traditional gender roles of seventeenth-century Europe: Mary was the dutiful wife and William held the power. George and Anne, however, reversed the roles: George was the dutiful husband and it was Anne who exercised the royal prerogatives. William had assumed incorrectly that George would use his marriage to Anne {{as a means of}} building a separate power base in Britain, but George never challenged his wife's authority and never strove to accrue influence. Anne occasionally used the image of wifely virtue to escape unpalatable situations by claiming, as a woman, she knew [...] "nothing except what the prince tells me", but it was an artifice. Husbands had a legal right to their wife's property, and it was argued that it was unnatural and against the church's teachings for a man to be subject to his wife. George made no such claim or demand; he was content to remain a prince and duke. [...] "I am her Majesty's subject", he said, [...] "I shall do naught <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> commands me." [...] In the words of historian Anne Somerset, [...] "the fact that Prince George was widely regarded as a nonentity helped reconcile people to his anomalous status, and so, almost by accident, George achieved a major advance for feminism." [...] Winston Churchill wrote that he [...] "was a fine-looking man, tall, blond, and good-natured... He was neither clever nor learned—a simple, normal man without envy or ambition, and disposed by remarkable appetite and thirst for all the pleasures of the table. Charles's well-known verdict... does not do justice to the homely virtues and unfailing good-humour of his staid and trustworthy character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite Bissix stating {{early in}} May 2008 {{that she was}} going to be with EastEnders for [...] "a while", it was {{announced}} a few weeks later on 23 May 2008 that she would be leaving EastEnders when her contract ended in the summer of 2008. Bissix has since revealed that she decided not to renew her contract. Bissix commented, [...] "I've had a great time at EastEnders and I have loved having the chance to play Clare again. I'm looking forward to trying new things." [...] Press reports suggested that Clare would depart the soap after she was exposed as a [...] "thoroughly nasty piece of work". A source told the press, [...] "Clare has been toiling away, trying it on with all the affluent men of Walford including Bradley Branning, Jack Branning and even Ian Beale <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had thought was a masterplan to bag the man of her dreams soon gets out of hand. She is forced to flee as it is clear she is not welcome in Albert Square anymore." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} lame, {{but it was}} true, and it was piteous; yet Langbourne could not relent. His {{grievance}} was not with what she had done, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was; not what she really was, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> materially was; her looks, her figure, her stature, her whole presence, so different from that {{which he had been}} carrying in his mind, and adoring for a year past.|$|E

6000|$|... "I cannot {{conceive}} why any {{man should}} marry such {{a woman as}} that. Not <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> a very good woman, I dare say; only what can a man get by it? To be sure there's the title, if that's worth anything." ...|$|R

6000|$|These {{were days}} of formless imaginings and ambitions. [...] "I will do! I will do!" [...] was her ceaseless cry to herself, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> could <b>she</b> do? <b>What</b> should <b>she</b> do? ...|$|R

5000|$|Teague Von Bohlen, Colorado Daily (September 1, 2000)Television is like kryptonite to comic-book heroes.... Don't {{fault the}} cast: Yancy Butler {{makes for a}} {{sufficiently}} sultry Sara Pezzini, the cop with a little something extra. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> missing is something that she couldn't bring to the role: the look of it all. Maybe that's why comics don't translate well to TV or even movies: because you can draw things that you just can't re-create on film.|$|R
