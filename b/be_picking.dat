5|$|The {{potential}} {{of both the}} car and Webber, who had certainly worked well to out-qualify his vastly more experienced teammate, was highlighted by the closeness they had to other teams which ran the Renault engine and although the Adrian Newey-designed car had flaws which contributed to Webber's scoreless season to that point. Though {{the pace of the}} car seemed to <b>be</b> <b>picking</b> up, with Coulthard qualifying in the top-10 for the , Webber was unable to convert his early weekend pace into a competitive grid position due to hydraulic problems. His race was much the same with a similar hydraulic problem leading to him retiring early in the race whilst teammate Coulthard notched up the team's first points with a fifth-place finish.|$|E

2500|$|Willie Jefferson of the Houston Chronicle, {{after seeing}} initial promotional {{material}} for the game, considered {{that several of the}} infected [...] "appear to be African-Americans" [...] implying a racist approach to the game, and also noted that [...] "setting the game in a city that was a scene of dead, bloated bodies floating by" [...] some years after the impact of Hurricane Katrina was [...] "a bad call". Faliszek, commenting on Jefferson's claims, considered the supposition to be [...] "utter insanity", and commented that the infected are a mix of all races, and that the game's version of New Orleans is [...] "not a brick-for-brick representation" [...] of the city and were not trying to make any statement about it with the game. A writer for Kotaku considered that Jefferson [...] "seems to me to <b>be</b> <b>picking</b> a fight where none exists." [...] Others noted that the appearance of African-American infected simply reflected the racial diversity of New Orleans.|$|E
2500|$|With Justin Hartley {{added as}} a series regular, Smallville would explore more of his backstory, {{including}} why he chose to become Green Arrow, how he accomplished it, and how he became good at archery. This season would also explore more of the friendship between Oliver Queen and Clark. Oliver would be broken down emotionally—questioning whether he {{made the right choice}} to sacrifice all for the sake of being Green Arrow—and that causes him to [...] "butt heads" [...] with Clark, who is beginning to embrace his destiny. Allison Mack's character, Chloe Sullivan, would have more romantic interests this season. Not only would the character still have Jimmy Olsen, but there is still the question of her romantic interest in Clark, as well as a new interest in the character of Davis Bloome. Mack's character would also <b>be</b> <b>picking</b> up the Isis Foundation, a counseling center for people infected by kryptonite, that Lana founded before she left Smallville. Mack explained that Chloe would be forging her own destiny this season, and letting Clark learn to deal with problems on his own—previous seasons saw Clark relying heavily on Chloe to help solve the crime.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to <b>be</b> <b>picking</b> heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
