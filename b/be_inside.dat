In April 2013, Disney officially announced the title on Twitter as Inside Out, during CinemaCon. Prior to its release, the film underwent a test screening for children, due to concerns from executives that it would be too complex for younger audiences—a fear quelled when the audience reacted positively to the picture.|$|E

Faced with the nigh-vegetative state Maria is in, Dom tearfully chooses to euthanize her. Marcus and Dom then charge into the Locust stronghold.|$|E
5|$|Later, Overman's corpse is discovered. Reviewing the body, Kay {{realizes that}} the shark that killed him is the first shark's mother, and that it must also <b>be</b> <b>inside</b> the park. She is able to {{convince}} Calvin about this newest development when the shark herself {{shows up at the}} window of the underwater cafe. Flushed out from her refuge inside a filtration pipe, the shark begins to wreak havoc on the park, injures a water skier, and causes a leak that nearly drowns everyone in the underwater tunnel. FitzRoyce and his assistant, Jack, go down to the filtration pipe in an attempt to lure the shark back in as a trap. FitzRoyce leads the shark into the pipe, but is then attacked and killed.|$|E
5|$|The A. sp. is {{from the}} latest Cretaceous aged Lo Hueco region in the Villalba de la Sierra Formation. A study shows that the area around Lo Hueco dates to the late Campanian and early Maastrichtian, {{although}} a more recent study revised the later date to the latest Maastrichtian. The study showed that Lo Hueco was near {{the coast of the}} Tethys Sea, a large seaway through southern Europe and northern Africa. The area directly on the coast was shown to be a brackish-freshwater aquatic environment, with a muddy flood-plain beside it. Lo Hueco was found to <b>be</b> <b>inside</b> the flood-plain. The flood plain was found to have distributary channels of sand and terrigenous material.|$|E

30|$|The {{procedure}} {{was similar to}} that in Experiment 2, with the following exceptions. Observers were shown 16 pictures. For each, they were asked whether a specific object <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> and selected one of the following answer choices and then indicated their confidence: (1) yes, the object <b>is</b> <b>inside</b> and I can use the bar to show you where it is; (2) yes, the object <b>is</b> <b>inside</b> but from the picture I cannot tell where it is; (3) from the picture I cannot tell whether the object is inside; or (4) no, the object <b>is</b> not <b>inside.</b> If Choice 1 was selected, they used the bar with inclinometer to indicate the location of the object. After they had made their selections for all pictures, they were told that the object <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> and asked to guess about the location by orienting the bar.|$|R
5|$|The second {{match was}} a Casket match between The Undertaker and Heidenreich. The match started {{back and forth}} until Heidenreich sent 'Taker into the casket. 'Taker applied the {{triangle}} choke until Gene Snitsky interfered and attacked 'Taker. Snitsky and Heidenreich attacked The Undertaker and called for the casket to be opened but Kane was revealed to <b>be</b> <b>inside</b> the casket. He attacked Snitsky and Heidenreich and fought Snitsky throughout the arena. Heidenreich sent 'Taker into the steel steps and pushed the casket into him. Heidenreich put 'Taker in the casket after applying the cobra clutch but 'Taker stopped the lid from closing with his arm. Heidenreich put 'Taker in the casket again but 'Taker countered. 'Taker executed a chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver and put Heidenreich in the casket to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Proposed in 1987 by Brinkman and Sues, Herrerasaurus has {{at times}} been {{considered}} basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia, although Brinkmann and Sues still considered it to <b>be</b> <b>inside</b> Dinosauria. They supported {{this on the}} basis that Herrerasaurus has a large pedal digit V, and has a well developed medial wall on the acetabulum. Brinkmann and Sues considered Staurikosaurus and Herrerasaurus to not form a true group called Herrerasauridae, and that instead they were successively more primitive forms. Also, they considered the characters used by Benedetto to be invalid, instead representing only the plesiomorphic state that was found in both taxa. This was disagreed with in 1992 by Novas, who stated many derived synapomorphies of Herrerasauridae, such as a distinct pubic boot, but still classified them as basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia. Novas defined the family as the least common ancestor of Herrerasaurus and Staurikosaurus and all its descendants. A differing definition of Herrerasaurus but not Passer domesticus first suggested by Sereno (1998), and more closely follows the original inclusion proposed by Benedetto. Another group, Herrerasauria was named by Galton in 1985, and defined as Herrerasaurus but not Liliensternus or Plateosaurus by Langer (2004), who used the node-based definition for Herrerasauridae.|$|E
5|$|When {{the parts}} for a Hamilcar were {{completed}} and the glider was erected, it was flown to RAF North Luffenham in Rutland {{to have its}} specific cargo placed on board, {{and it was then}} flown to RAF Tarrant Rushton, which had been selected as the Hamilcar training and operational base in November 1943. It was not possible to tow the glider empty, so any empty gliders usually carried Universal Carriers or concrete blocks as ballast. Training with the Hamilcar appears to have taken place primarily at RAF Tarrant Rushton, and began sometime between the end of 1943 and the first months of 1944. Hamilcar training began with dual instruction, where an instructor accompanied the pilots for several hours, and then moved onto flying solo flights. Most of this training consisted of 'circuits and bumps', where the pilots practised controlling the glider as it took off from an airfield under tow, and then landing it after the tow rope was detached; cross-country navigation was also practised. It was common practice for members of airlanded units to <b>be</b> <b>inside</b> the gliders as cargo when training took place, although there is evidence that tank crews only acted as cargo for one or two flights, probably due to the risk of accidents which might cost the lives of specialised troops and equipment. Those flights that tank crews did experience usually consisted of gliders landing on carefully marked airfields instead of the open countryside to minimise the risks involved, and also make recovery of the glider easier. Accidents do not seem to have been a common occurrence. During training by 'C' Squadron of the Glider Pilot Regiment, part of the Army Air Corps, which specialised in flying Hamilcars, over 2800 lifts were made with an average of 50 lifts per crew. Only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries, with seven pilots killed during the training.|$|E
