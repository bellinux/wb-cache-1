Sue gets over her obsession with Mac and finds love with a new man, who reciprocates her feelings. The episode concludes with Caroline being carried into the air by a mass of helium filled balloons at the wedding reception, although on the DVD boxset extras it shows an alternate ending where Guy and Mac grab onto Caroline's ankles and are taken to the sky with her; this alternative ending ends with Mac saying, [...] "Caroline, there's something I've <b>been</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> tell you." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, {{the team}} had {{released}} Fuse, which was a critical and commercial failure. The team now reflected on the reasons for its poor reception, and felt that they {{should go back to}} Insomniac's roots — developing unusual titles with vibrant visuals — instead of another dark shooter like Fuse. They also thought that Sunset Overdrives stylization should reflect the personality of the company, and that building a world that has a sense of humor and irreverence was something the team was eager to do. Ted Price, CEO of Insomniac Games, described it as a game Insomniac had wanted to develop for a long time. The game's producer, Bryan Intihar, called it: [...] "...the game [...] <b>been</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> make for 20 years." [...] Microsoft supported it and shared the same vision and the idea of creating something new.|$|E

In {{this version of the}} ending, when Mac sees Caroline floating away, he runs down the stairs and out of the castle to save her. Caroline begins to descend, and both Mac and Guy grab hold of one her legs to bring her down, but instead they are lifted into the air with her. While the three fly away Caroline exclaims [...] "We're all going to die!", to which Mac quite sternly says [...] "Caroline, there's something I've <b>been</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> tell you", opening the possibility that Mac is not going to die.

500|$|The album's {{title track}} was said by band members {{to be the}} {{continuation}} of [...] "Final Six", which was an outtake from their previous album. [...] "Final Six" [...] origins deal with the apocalypse. [...] "Human Strain" [...] deals with apocalyptic origins as well. The track was explained by guitarist Jeff Hanneman to initially be about the human race dying off by a mutative disease. The title of [...] "Public Display of Dismemberment" [...] refers to the consequences that countries outside of the United States give to citizens for crimes. Tom Araya said that [...] "Unit 731" [...] is [...] "very similar to Josef Mengele {{in the sense that}} it was a medical unit in the military, which was a Japanese military unit, actually. They did kind of the same thing; they tested the limits of the human body and recorded it for scientific purposes." [...] "Playing With Dolls" [...] is about a child witnessing a serial killer. [...] "Beauty Through Order" [...] is about Elizabeth Báthory, the most prolific female serial killer. Jeff Hanneman explained: [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> write a song about that for a long time. I couldn't figure out the angle, I was thinking, 'How does a woman write? I can't write like a woman I'm a guy!' Then I just figured, 'Well, she's evil; she has lots of power and killed people.' So I just started writing and the lyrics and they came out." [...] Slayer revealed to Revolver that the track [...] "Snuff" [...] has no lyrical concept. [...] "Psychopathy Red" [...] was inspired by the Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo.|$|E

2500|$|Blanchett {{returned}} to the theatre in 2009 with the Sydney Theatre Company production of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, directed by Liv Ullmann. She starred as Blanche DuBois alongside Joel Edgerton as Stanley Kowalski. Ullmann and Blanchett had <b>been</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> collaborate on a project since Ullman's intended film adaption of A Doll's House fell by the wayside. Blanchett proposed embarking on Streetcar to Ullmann, who jumped at the opportunity after initial discussion. The production traveled from Sydney to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, and the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. It was critically and commercially successful and Blanchett received critical acclaim for her performance as Blanche DuBois. The New York Times critic Ben Brantley said, [...] "DuBois has been pulled gently and firmly down to earth by Ms. Blanchett and Ms. Ullmann ... What Ms. Blanchett brings to the character is life itself, a primal survival instinct ... All the baggage that any [...] "Streetcar" [...] usually travels with has been jettisoned. Ms. Ullmann and Ms. Blanchett have performed the play {{as if it had}} never been staged before, with the result that, as a friend of mine put it, [...] "you feel like you’re hearing words you thought you knew pronounced correctly for the first time."" [...] The Washington Posts Peter Marks proclaimed, [...] "What Blanchett achieves in the Sydney Theatre Company's revelatory revival of [...] "A Streetcar Named Desire" [...] amounts to a truly great portrayal—certainly the most heartbreaking Blanche I've ever experienced." [...] John Lahr of The New Yorker said of her portrayal, [...] "Blanchett, with her alert mind, her informed heart, and her lithe, patrician silhouette, gets it right from the first beat ... Blanchett doesn’t make the usual mistake of foreshadowing Blanche’s end at the play’s beginning; she allows Blanche a slow, fascinating decline ... I don’t expect to see a better performance of this role in my lifetime." [...] Jane Fonda, who attended a New York show, deemed it [...] "perhaps the greatest stage performance I have ever seen", and Meryl Streep declared, [...] "That performance was as naked, as raw and extraordinary and astonishing and surprising and scary as anything I've ever seen ... She took the layers of a person and just peeled them away. I thought I'd seen that play, I thought I knew all the lines by heart, because I've seen it so many times, but I'd never seen the play until I saw that performance." [...] Blanchett won the Sydney Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. The production and Blanchett received Helen Hayes Awards, for Outstanding Non-Resident Production and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production award, respectively.|$|E
