5|$|Green-head ant {{males are}} {{produced}} irregularly {{throughout the year}} and are low-flying ants. Recorded nuptial flights begin between September to November at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), when a number of males begin to emerge from their nest. Sometimes, however, the males may return to their nest after briefly appearing outside. The green-head ant is a gamergate species, which means that males can successfully mate with the workers. These workers remain outside their nest with their head and thorax appressed and gaster elevated into the air. Observation has shown the workers first attacking the males when the two first encounter each other, followed by the male mounting the worker by grasping it in the cervical region with its mandibles, successfully attaching itself. Both ants usually rest when they mate, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> workers may groom themselves or move about several moments after, thereby disengaging with the male. On a few occasions, workers have been seen to move as soon as copulation begins and drag the male, eventually dislodging it. Copulation usually occurs at 8 to 9 in the morning, with pairs lasting for 30 seconds to almost one minute. Most pairs mate once, but others may copulate with each other twice. In some cases, males will successfully mate with two workers, and some pairs may return to their nest while mating.|$|E

25|$|The {{achievements}} of Hall in the U.S. and of Héroult in Europe, and {{their influence on}} aluminum companies, some through Héroult's Société Electrometallurgique Française, have been {{called one of the}} greatest events in metallurgy. Over ten years, aluminum output in the U.S. increased by 100,000 times and its price dropped to about 2% of its cost before their discovery. Cowles engineered a separate venture and did not share that glory, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> brothers are credited with envisioning and promoting what was the beginning of electrical smelting on a large scale.|$|E
25|$|Computer {{animation}} {{is the art}} {{of creating}} moving images via the use of computers. It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation. Increasingly it is created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> target is another medium, such as film. It is also referred to as CGI (Computer-generated imagery or computer-generated imaging), especially when used in films.|$|E

25|$|Normally batsmen never {{attempt to}} run byes when the wicket-keeper catches the ball. However, in {{situations}} {{at the end}} of a game when the batting team must score runs quickly in order to have a chance of winning, the batsmen may risk running a bye and hope that the wicket-keeper fumbles the ball or throws it inaccurately when attempting to run a batsman out. The usual result of this is a batsman's being run out, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> tactic pays off with a few One Day International matches having been won on byes.|$|E
25|$|Computer {{animation}} is the art, technique, {{and science}} of creating moving images via {{the use of}} computers. It is becoming more common to be created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes {{the target of the}} animation is the computer itself, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> target is another medium, such as film. It is also referred to as CGI (Computer-generated imagery or computer-generated imaging), especially when used in films. Applications include medical animation, which is most commonly utilized as an instructional tool for medical professionals or their patients.|$|E
25|$|Parsons {{was also}} a painter. In 1959, Tony Smith {{designed}} her waterfront house-studio on the North Fork of {{the east end of}} Long Island, New York, perched on a cliff overlooking Long Island Sound, where Parsons worked on her art in her time off from the gallery. Her painting style changed in 1947, turning from small landscapes and portraits into a bold, subjective abstraction when she began to make constructions from bits of wood and other materials that washed up on the beach near her home; most often her constructions reflected the area around her North Fork home, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> pieces reflected her travels to the Caribbean and abroad.|$|E

25|$|Screen shot: Screen {{shots are}} blind shots, {{in which the}} goalie can not find the {{location}} of the puck. Goalies should never anticipate or guess when and where the puck will hit. In the screen shot, another player (usually an opponent, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> goaltender's own teammate) stands between the shooter and the goaltender, obscuring the goaltender's vision of the shot. On a screen shot, the goaltender must do everything possible to try to see the shot, dropping to the butterfly stance and thrusting their glove out at the sound of a shot is not the best idea in the modern game. Some goalies, such as Ed Belfour or Ron Hextall, went as far as (illegally) punching players in the head or slashing their legs.|$|E
25|$|Pennies, healing potions, antidotes and, often, quest {{items and}} weapon {{upgrades}} {{can be found}} in chests throughout the game. Often, chests will simply open when Bilbo touches them, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes,</b> <b>the</b> chests are locked, and Bilbo must pick the lock. This involves a timed minigame in which the player must align a pointer or select a specific target. Some chests will have only one minigame to complete, but chests containing more important items will have more, up to a maximum of eight. If Bilbo misses the pointer/target, the timer will jump forward; if he hits a red pointer or target, the minigame will end immediately. Penalties for failing to open a chest include losing health points or being poisoned. If the player has a skeleton key, they can bypass the minigames and open the chest immediately.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea behind}} the {{pinewood}} derby is for the parent, usually the father, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> mother or grandparent, to spend time helping the child design, carve, paint, add weights, and tune the final car. However, it {{is often the case}} that the parent takes over the construction of the car, an aspect of the event that was lampooned in the 2005 film Down and Derby, and also in a 2009 episode of South Park. The quest for a fast car supports a cottage industry that supplies modified wheels, axles, and blocks as well as videos and instruction books. While a pinewood derby car kit costs around US$4, a set of modified wheels and axles can sell for more than ten times that amount. Each pack sets its own rules under the guidelines set forth by the BSA and their particular local district. The aftermarket items are legal under some Pack rules since the parts originally came from an official Boy Scouts of America (BSA) kit. Complete cars can be purchased on eBay and elsewhere for around $100 to $200, and PineCar, a subsidiary of Woodland Scenics, sells pre-cut or pre-made cars, as well as official kits. Although these cars violate the spirit of the event, if not the rules, enforcement can be difficult.|$|E

An image of Rodemeyer was shown on the backdrop as Gaga announced: [...] "We lost a Little Monster this week. I wrote this record about how your identity is really all you've got when you're in school... so tonight, Jamey, I know you're up there looking at us, and you're not a victim... you're a lesson to all of us.

500|$|A {{clutch of}} two or three pale brown- and lavender-spotted pinkish eggs are {{normally}} laid. They measure [...] and are a tapered oval in shape. The eggs are normally incubated by both parents, but sometimes just by the female. They hatch after 16–21 days. The chicks are born almost naked {{with a small amount of}} grey down on their head and body. They are mostly brooded by the female <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> male will also do so. The nestlings are fed by both parents, and occasionally immature birds will also contribute. Their eyes open at around 7 days. They fledge 15–20 days after hatching and both parents continue to feed them for a further 2–3 weeks. Young are given manna (crystallised plant sap) and insects such as beetles, bugs and flies.|$|E

500|$|Throughout gameplay, {{the player}} {{encounters}} minigames accessed through an in-game GPS system called Mappie, which is rendered {{as a point}} and click map. In most cases, the player can choose to automatically skip accessing Mappie, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> player is required to play through the minigame {{to move on to}} the next event. When accessing Mappie, the player meets various people who become Kotarou's friends, and certain people and items encountered will lead the player to do a quest. The names of the friends and the completed quests are recorded in the Memory function, which serves as an encyclopedia of events. If the player completes all 31 quests, a bonus scenario called [...] is made available. Oppai is a branch off Akane's scenario and serves as a comedic plot line not important to the overall story.|$|E
500|$|Jake Adelstein, former crime {{reporter}} for the Yomiuri Shimbun, said these three acquired companies [...] "shared addresses and office space with several other companies with different names <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> same employees, creating a web of real and paper companies that make tracking the money very difficult." [...] He also alleged that Japanese authorities {{considered one of the}} auditors involved [...] "a corporate blood brother... to the Yamaguchi-gumi." [...] Sankei Shimbun said there were perhaps 10 brokers involved in the acquisition schemes, and that while they [...] "are not members of crime syndicates themselves..... conduct economic activities together with antisocial forces... There is the possibility that Olympus has supplied cash (to organised crime) as a result." [...] However, the investigatory panel set up by Olympus rejected reports the allegations that the acquisition funds could found their way to organised crime. Panel chairman Tatsuo Kainaka said [...] "Our committee has confirmed no such facts in its investigations so far." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{commonly}} used ebauches during this period were those manufactured by Ebauches SA (now ETA, SA), namely the Valjoux and Landeron calibres. [...] The 17 jewel Valjoux 84 lever movement with stem wind {{was the most common}} Valjoux movement for the Bovet chronographs, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> 77 calibre was also used. [...] The Landeron movements were more varied, which included the 47, 48, 51, 57, 59, 80, 81 calibres, and for the rare date and moonphase models, the Landeron 186 was used. [...] Most of the Bovet Freres watches contained Valjoux movements, while most of the Favre-Leuba watches contained Landeron movements. It has been said that the Valjoux were the better produced of the ebauches, indeed the best at the time, and that over time the Landeron became more common and cheap in quality, and it is said that the poor quality of the Landeron had a negative impact on the Bovet name. [...] These chronographs were produced in large numbers, and are fairly commonly found on the internet for purchase. This was a commercial divergence in the Bovet identity which is unique in the Bovet history, as it is normally known for refined artistic pieces, and not utility.|$|E
