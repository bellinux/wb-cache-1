The Princeton Review named Augustana as one of 159 [...] "Best in the Midwest" [...] schools in 2015. Forbes' list of [...] "America's Top Colleges" [...] placed Augustana at #97 among schools in the Midwest and #423 overall.

2500|$|Writing for {{the website}} No Ripcord, Gary McGinley {{said that the}} song [...] "has an aching beauty and the {{hallmarks}} of a modern standard." [...] He further added that it [...] "sounds poised to soundtrack atmospheric TV trailers over the coming months." [...] A writer of [...] URB magazine called [...] "Someone like You" [...] "a heart-wrencher {{made all the more}} real by reeling phrasing and bare-voiced pleading, 'I wish nothing but the <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> too.'" [...] John Murphy of MusicOMH categorized [...] "Someone like You" [...] and [...] "Turning Tables" [...] as [...] "the two best songs on the album." [...] He concluded that the song was [...] "desperately sad and utterly, utterly gorgeous." [...] Bary Walters of Spin wrote that on [...] "the piano-led finale, she vows, 'I'll find someone like you,' as if that's progress. It's a statement that's utterly WTF and yet true to the cyclical nature of psychological damage." [...] Sputnikmusics Joseph Viney called the song [...] "an ode to stalking with a perverse attitude that lies underneath the fragile composition, looks set to become the soundtrack to a million messy break-ups." [...] Allison Stewart of The Washington Post put the song on her list [...] "Recommended tracks".|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{talks about the}} end of Adele's first [...] "real relationship" [...] with her long-time friend and lover and it shows her confronting his marriage. At the {{beginning}} of the song, she sings the lines [...] "I heard that you're settled down/That you found a girl and you're married now. I heard that your dreams came true/Guess she gave you things I [...] couldn't give to you" [...] with a softly voice and accompanied just by a simple piano melody. The lyrics of [...] "Someone like You" [...] are talking about what once was and what could have been as stated by a writer of Daily Herald. Finding the strength to bounce back from hardship and heartache, Adele sings the lines, [...] "Never mind, I'll find someone like you. I wish nothing but the <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> too/Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said/Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead." [...] Talking about the meaning and the composition of the song, Jer Fairall of PopMatters said: [...] "The song's subject—Adele mentally addressing an old lover who has since found happiness elsewhere—is familiar, but the detail she colors it with are vibrantly tactile and resonant, from the sense-memory setting of 'we were born and raised in a summer haze' to her recollection of his cruel kiss-off line 'I remember you said, 'sometimes it lasts in love and sometimes it hurts instead' and how she comes to take solace in the statement as an empowering mantra." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to {{sheet music}} {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony Music Publishing, [...] "Someone like You" [...] {{is a slow}} tempo of 68 beats per minute. Written in common time, the song is in the key of A major. Adele's vocal range spans from F3 to E5 during the song. A slow, plaintive ballad pairing Adele's voice with a looping piano line, [...] "Someone like You" [...] is the lyrical opposite of [...] "Rolling in the Deep" [...] on which the singer narrates {{coming to terms with}} the end of the relationship: [...] "Nevermind, I'll find someone like you/I wish nothing but the <b>best</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> too/Don't forget me, I beg/I'll remember you said/Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead." [...] According to Sean Fennessey of The Village Voice, the singer's [...] "nuanced" [...] voice goes up a full octave and [...] "into a near-shrieked whisper" [...] as she sings parts of the chorus. However, she [...] "rebounds and gathers herself", and her voice descends into its fuller and more melancholy state. Critics praised its introspective lyrics and maturity. [...] "Someone like You" [...] has been compared to the song [...] "Hometown Glory" [...] (2008) from the album 19. John Murphy of MusicOMH said that the song [...] "casts Adele as the spurned lover, turning up outside her ex's house, now moved on and settled down, begging for a second chance." [...] According to Aamir Yaqub of Soul Culture, [...] "Talking of a lost love, this an extremely touching track with a vocal performance that makes the narrative almost tangible ... It really captures the experience of the story and puts it across in both a credible and incredible fashion." [...] Cameron Adams of Herald Sun called the song a [...] "spine-tingling sparse piano ballad." ...|$|E
