50|$|On May 27, 1892, {{while working}} as {{superintendent}} for the Illinois Institution for the Blind, Hall unveiled the Hall Braille Writer. The typewriter is recognized as the first successful mechanical point writer. Modeled on typewriters of the time, his invention revolutionized Braille communication. Prior to his invention, Braille was not widely taught by teachers of the blind, because teaching <b>Braille</b> involved <b>writing</b> <b>boards</b> on which a student had to push {{one or more of}} six Braille character points in reverse. The Hall Braille Writer, along with Hall's advocacy, helped make Braille the dominant form of written communication for the blind. He never patented the machine because he thought profit would sully his work with the blind. The Hall Braille Writer was manufactured by the Harrison & Seifried company in Chicago, Illinois. It was manufactured for 10 dollars and sold for 11 dollars. Distribution of the machine has been found in library collections as far away as Australia and China.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{reported}} work advances the state-of-the-art in {{assistive technology}} for the blind by enhancing a low-cost automated tutor designed to teach <b>braille</b> <b>writing</b> skills to visually impaired children using voice feedback. We first provide some background on how the methodology of Intelligent Tutoring Systems correlates to an automated tutor for teaching <b>braille</b> <b>writing</b> skills. We then build on prior work to enhance our automated <b>Braille</b> <b>Writing</b> Tutor in three dimensions: (1) Initial field testing in three different countries; (2) Exploring customization needs for improving relevance in different cultures; and (3) Adding relevant games for increasing motivation. The outcome of this work is an enhanced low-cost tool that can help to increase braille literacy in blind communities around the world. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Less than 3 % of the 145 million {{blind people}} living in {{developing}} countries are literate. This low literacy rate {{is partly due to}} the lack of trained teachers and the challenges associated with learning to <b>write</b> <b>Braille</b> on a traditional slate and stylus. These challenges include writing from right to left, writing mirrored images of letters, and receiving significantly delayed feedback. Extensive conversations with the Mathru School for the Blind near Bangalore, India, revealed the need for a robust, low-power, low-cost <b>Braille</b> <b>writing</b> tutor. We present an iterative and participatory design process resulting in the creation and refinement of a prototype <b>Braille</b> <b>writing</b> tutor system. This system uses a novel input device to capture a student’s activity on a slate using a stylus and uses a range of techniques to teach <b>Braille</b> <b>writing</b> skills to both beginner and advanced students. We report on lessons learned from the implementation of this project and from a six-week pilot study at the Mathru school, and outline future directions for improvement.

Dr. Niles, not only she founded the school, but she also created the first <b>Braille</b> <b>writing</b> system in Cantonese language. Although Dr. Niles knew very little about education for the blind, since she specialized in gynecology and obstetrics, she decided to translate Chinese characters into Braille, by learning it first herself with infinite care and patience in order to translate it into Chinese. She made a monumental achievement when she translated the <b>Braille</b> <b>writing</b> system into the Cantonese language, for which Mary Nile's alma mater, the Elmira College, awarded her a degree of L.L.D in 1917.|$|R

Also in the profiles, as the facts cycled in and out, numbers were apparent on the screen, and they were an alphabet code (where 1=A, 2=B, and so on). The messages spelled out [...] "The Mole is not ___" [...] a different player each week, and in week nine, it spelled out [...] "The Mole is not Craig." [...] Although not shown on the final segment, in week 10, it said: [...] "The Mole is John". Since the <b>Braille</b> <b>writing</b> indicated that the Mole was a man, that cancels Liz of being the traitor. This left only John.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Braille {{is vital}} to all {{visually}} impaired individuals and it’s the only system through which visually impaired children can learn to read and write, yet the rate of Braille literacy among visually impaired people belonging to developing countries including Pakistan is alarming low. Today in developing countries less than 3 % of visually impaired children are learning to read Braille in school. This continues {{despite the fact that}} studies have shown that 80 % of all employed visually impaired people read and <b>write</b> <b>Braille</b> fluently. Thus, Braille literacy is the key to employment and full participation in society. This research paper presents the design of a low-cost, low-power, portable, self-learning, and user friendly Braille system. The designed system serves as <b>Braille</b> <b>writing</b> and reading tutor, so visually impaired people can enhance their <b>Braille</b> <b>writing</b> and reading skills without the assistance of a Braille teacher. The designed system takes the input through Braille keyboard and produces the speech output and it also has the capability to read documents. It is believed that by implementing the designed Braille system in schools and homes, Braille literacy rate can be increased and visually impaired people can be employed and can fully participate in society...|$|R

50|$|A CogInfoCom {{application}} can {{be regarded}} as an instance of representation sharing even if it bridges between different sensors. For example, if text is conveyed to a blind person using <b>Braille</b> <b>writing,</b> the tactile sensory modality is used instead of vision, but the representation still consists of a linear succession of textual elements which represent individual characters in the alphabet. By the same token, a CogInfoCom application {{can be regarded}} as representation bridging even if it uses sensor sharing.|$|R
50|$|The exact {{function}} of the Giza <b>writing</b> <b>board</b> remains unclear. In normal cases, royal scribes used such <b>writing</b> <b>boards</b> for calligraphic and dictional practices. Or they used them as blueprints for later relief decorations. However, the hieroglyphic design and the depictions of the animals on the Giza <b>writing</b> <b>board</b> are way too detailed and professionally exercised to be a simple blueprint or writing test. For this reasons, some scholars think {{it was possible that}} Mesdjerw created his <b>writing</b> <b>board</b> as some kind of notebook for the afterlife. Such things were similar to the offering stelae inside tomb chambers of royal officials and their popularity grew during the New Kingdom period. Old Kingdom examples, however, are extremely rare and in case of the Giza <b>writing</b> <b>board</b> unique in its design.|$|R

40|$|The {{adaptation}} of <b>Braille</b> in <b>writing</b> the Quran {{is one of}} the most important contributions of the Muslims to ensure that the visually challenged amongst them are able to learn and readthe words of God. To date, Muslim countries, including Malaysia, have produced their own versions of the Quran in Braille, yet these Qurans are not based on the Uthmanic method of Quranic orthography. Consequently, this has led to variations, mistakes and inconsistencies in the spelling and marking of the Quranic verses. In this paper, the aim is to propose an Uthmanic model of Quranic orthography in Braille. It focuses on the chapter of Maryam as its sample and applies the qualitative methods of textual and comparative analysis on the revelational criteria of Quranic orthography and the limitations of the <b>Braille</b> <b>writing</b> system. This results in a more standardized and adaptable model of Quranic orthography in Braille with minimal changes in theuse of vocalization and other diacritical marks of the Quran. Currently, this model is proposed toserve as a basis for the development of a national standard of Quranic orthography in Braille by the relevant authorities in cooperation with the visually challenged organizations in Malaysia...|$|R
