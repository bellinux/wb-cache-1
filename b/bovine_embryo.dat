The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of GLIS 1 in the preimplantation development of <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos.</b> GLIS 1 transcripts in in vitro-matured oocytes and 1 -cell to 4 -cell stage embryos were detected, but they were either absent or at trace levels at the 8 -cell to blastocyst stages. We attempted GLIS 1 downregulation of <b>bovine</b> early <b>embryos</b> by RNA interference and evaluated developmental competency and gene transcripts, which are involved in zygotic gene activation (ZGA) in GLIS 1 -downregulated embryos. Injection of specific siRNA resulted in a distinct decrease in GLIS 1 transcript in <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> at the 4 -cell stage. Although the <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> injected with GLIS 1 -siRNA could develop to the 16 -cell stage, these embryos had difficulty in developing beyond the 32 -cell stage.

40|$|The {{effect of}} two {{glycoprotein}}s (estrus-associated glycoprotein [EGP] and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase [TIMP- 1]) secreted by bovine oviduct cells on in vitro <b>bovine</b> <b>embryo</b> development was assessed. A {{first set of}} experiments was conducted {{to determine whether the}} embryotrophic activity of the bovine oviduct-conditioned medium (BOCM) was correlated with the presence of EGP or TIMP- 1. EGP and TIMP- 1 were detected in BOCM, supporting the development of 22 % zygotes to the blastocyst stage, as well as in BOCM yielding a low blastocyst rate (3 - 4 % blastocysts). These glycoproteins {{do not seem to be}} necessary for <b>bovine</b> <b>embryo</b> development up to the blastocyst stage in our BOCM. In a second experiment, zygotes were cultured in modified synthetic oviduct fluid (mSOF) supplemented with different concentrations (0. 5, 5, 50, and 500 micrograms/ml) of purified bovine EGP. In the third experiment, since purified bovine TIMP- 1 was not available, zygotes were cultured in BOCM depleted of TIMP- 1 by immunoprecipitation treatment. Adding EGP to mSOF, or removing TIMP- 1 from BOCM, did not affect <b>bovine</b> <b>embryo</b> development up to the blastocyst stage, or mean number of cells per blastocyst after 8 days of culture.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{development}} and metabolic activity of cultured murine and <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> in 2 standard media (HAM F- 10 and RPMI) in the presence or absence of bovine uterine flushings. Murine morulae (n = 653) and day 7 <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> (n = 273) were cultured for 18 h or 36 h in either HAM F- 10 or RPMI in the presence or absence of bovine uterine flushings. After culture, the development, quality, and metabolic activity (glucose utilization or methionine uptake and incorporation) of embryos was assessed. It was found that HAM F- 10 (without uterine flushings) was a more suitable medium than RPMI for optimal development and metabolism of murine and <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos.</b> Poor quality and development, as well as decreased metabolism, were evident after culture of murine embryos in RPMI; in contrast, this medium had no adverse effects on <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> in culture. Supplementation of HAM F- 10 with bovine uterine flushings improved the growth of murine embryos and the protein synthesis (as measured by an increased methionine incorporation) for both murine and <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos.</b> However, supplementation with bovine uterine flushings could not overcome deficiencies of an inappropriate medium (RPMI) for murine embryos.

40|$|Low oxygen {{conditions}} (2 %) during post-compaction {{culture of}} <b>bovine</b> blastocysts improve <b>embryo</b> quality, which {{is associated with}} a small yet significant increase in the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT- 1), suggesting a role of oxygen in embryo development mediated through oxygen-sensitive gene expression. However, <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> to at least the blastocyst stage lack a key regulator of oxygen-sensitive gene expression, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF 1 α). A second, less well-characterized protein (HIF 2 α) is, however, detectable from the 8 -cell stage of development. Here we use differential display to determine additional gene targets in <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> in response to low oxygen conditions. While development to the blastocyst stage was unaffected by the oxygen concentration used during post-compaction culture, differential display identified oxygen-regulation of myotrophin and anaphase promoting complex 1 expression, with significantly lower levels observed following culture under 20 % oxygen than 2 % oxygen. These results further support the hypothesis that the level of gene expression of specific transcripts by <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> alters in response to changes in the oxygen environment post-compaction.

Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were fertilized after in vitro maturation. The presumed zygotes were cultured in in vitro culture medium supplemented with or without 10 (- 7) M melatonin. The cleavage rate, 8 -cell rate and blastocyst rate were examined to identify the kinetics of embryo development. The hatched blastocyst rate, mortality rate after thawing and the relevant transcript abundance were measured to {{evaluate the}} quality of blastocyst. The results showed that melatonin significantly promoted the cleavage rate and 8 -cell embryo yield of in vitro produced <b>bovine</b> <b>embryo.</b> In addition, significantly more blastocysts were observed by Day 7 of embryo culture at the presence of melatonin. These results indicated that melatonin accelerated the development of in vitro produced bovine embryos. Following vitrification at Day 7 of embryo culture, melatonin (10 (- 7) M) significantly increased the hatched blastocyst rate from 24 h to 72 h and decreased the mortality rate from 48 h to 72 h after thawing. The presence of melatonin during the embryo culture resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} gene expressions of DNMT 3 A, OCC, CDH 1 and decrease in that of AQP 3 after thawing.

One proposed mechanism for this transition from maternal to zygotic control of development (maternal to zygotic genome activation; MZGA) is the appearance of transcription factors that activate specific genes in the embryonic genome. The E 26 transforming specific (Ets) family of transcription factors is involved in development, differentiation and protease regulation, and is a logical candidate gene {{to be involved in}} MZGA. Determining the role of Ets- 1 in early {{embryo development}} may provide useful insight into mechanisms contributing to early embryonic death and pregnancy failure.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the histone modification, H 3 R 26 me 2 during pre-implantation development of IVP <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> cultured with or without serum supplementation and how these in vitro treatments compared to in vivo embryos at the morula stage. After in vitro maturation and fertilization, <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> were cultured with either 0 or 2. 5 % fetal bovine serum (FBS). Development was evaluated and embryos were collected and fixed at different stages during development (2 -, 4 -, 8 -, 16 -cell, morula and blastocyst). Fixed embryos were then used for immunofluorescence utilizing an antibody for H 3 R 26 me 2. Images of stained embryos were analyzed as a percentage of total DNA. Embryos cultured with 2. 5 % FBS developed to blastocysts at a greater rate than 0 %FBS groups (34. 85 ± 5. 43 % vs. 23. 38 ± 2. 93 %; P< 0. 05). Levels of H 3 R 26 me 2 changed for both groups over development. In the 0 %FBS group, the greatest amount of H 3 R 26 me 2 staining was at the 4 -cell (P< 0. 05), 16 -cell (P< 0. 05) and morula (P< 0. 05) stages. In the 2. 5 %FBS group, only 4 -cell stage embryos were significantly higher than all other stages (P< 0. 01). Morula stage in vivo embryos had similar levels as the 0 %FBS group, and both were significantly higher than the 2. 5 %FBS group. These results suggest that the histone modification H 3 R 26 me 2 is regulated during development of pre-implantation <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos,</b> and that culture conditions greatly alter this regulation...|$|R
40|$|Apoptosis {{is a form}} of {{cell death}} that can {{function}} to elimi-nate cells damaged by environmental stress. One stress that can compromise embryonic development is elevated temperature (i. e., heat shock). For the current studies, we hypothesized that heat shock induces apoptosis in <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> in a develop-mentally regulated manner. Studies were performed to 1) deter-mine whether heat shock can induce apoptosis in preimplanta-tion embryos, 2) test whether heat-induced apoptosis is devel-opmentally regulated, 3) evaluate whether heat shock-induced changes in caspase activity parallel patterns of apoptosis, and 4) ascertain whether exposure to a mild heat shock can protect embryos from heat-induced apoptosis. As determined by TUNEL reaction, exposure of <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos</b> $ 16 cells on Day 5 after insemination to 41 or 428 C for 9 h increased the percentage o...|$|R
