Subsequently Räikkönen decided to not take part in the rally at all, even when he could by super rally rules. The reason was stated to <b>be</b> <b>saving</b> the car.|$|E
500|$|While Disney {{executives}} {{had discussed}} closing Feature Animation as redundant, Catmull and Lasseter refused and instead resolved {{to try to}} turn things around at the studio. Lasseter said [...] "we weren't going to let that [...] happen on our watch. We were determined to save the legacy of Walt Disney's amazing studio and bring it back up to the creative level it had to <b>be.</b> <b>Saving</b> this heritage was squarely on our shoulders." [...] Lasseter and Catmull set about rebuilding the morale of the Feature Animation staff, and rehired a number of its 1980s [...] "new guard" [...] generation of star animators who had left the studio, including Ron Clements, John Musker, Eric Goldberg, Mark Henn, Andreas Deja, Bruce W. Smith, and Chris Buck. To maintain the separation of Feature Animation and Pixar despite their now common ownership and management, Catmull and Lasseter [...] "drew a hard line" [...] that each studio was solely responsible for its own projects and {{would not be allowed to}} borrow personnel from or lend tasks out to the other. Catmull said that he and Lasseter [...] "make sure the studios are quite distinct from each other. We don’t want them to merge; that would definitely be the wrong approach. Each should have its own personality." ...|$|E

2500|$|During this period, Moro wrote several {{letters to}} {{the leaders of the}} Christian Democrats and to Pope Paul VI, who later {{personally}} officiated in Moro's Funeral Mass. Some of those letters, at times very critical of Andreotti, were kept secret for more than a decade, and published only in the early 1990s. In his letters, Moro said that the state's primary objective should <b>be</b> <b>saving</b> lives, and that the government should comply with his kidnappers' demands. Most of the Christian Democrat leaders argued that the letters did not express Moro's genuine wishes, claiming they were written under duress, and thus refused all negotiation. This was {{in stark contrast to the}} requests of Moro's family. In his appeal to the terrorists, Pope Paul asked them to release Moro [...] "without conditions".|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea that}} would {{eventually}} become Groupon {{was born out of}} founder Andrew Mason's frustration trying to cancel a cell phone contract in 2006. Mason thought that there must be some way to leverage large number of people's collective bargaining power. In 2007 Mason launched The Point, a web platform based on the [...] "tipping point" [...] principle that would utilize social media to get people together to accomplish a goal. The Point was intended to organize people around some sort of cause or goal. It gained only modest traction in Chicago, until a group of users decided their cause would <b>be</b> <b>saving</b> money. They wanted to round up people to buy the same product in order to receive a group discount. Founder Eric Lefkofsky wanted the company to pivot in order to focus entirely on group buying. [...] Born from The Point, Groupon was launched in November 2008.|$|E
2500|$|... : Nezu (born December 11, 1964) is a {{opposition}} parliament {{member who}} is also the leader of the terrorist resistance movement against the government. He seems to be the mentor of Kei and Ryu, and purports to <b>be</b> <b>saving</b> the nation from the corrupt and ineffective bureaucrats in power. It soon becomes evident, however, that Nezu is just as corrupt, and that all he seeks to do is to seize power for himself. He later betrays Lady Miyako, as well as various other characters, as he attempts to take control of Akira. After losing Akira, he finds Ryu in a dark corridor with the boy in tow. He attempts to kill Ryu, thinking {{he is a member of}} Lady Miyako's group all along. Ryu, however, shoots Nezu. Nezu later tries to shoot Akira before he can be taken into the Colonel's custody. He misses and shoots Takashi in the head, instantly killing him. He was in turn shot and killed by the Colonel's men.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, a {{few months}} after the couple's second wedding, the writers {{complicated}} JR and Babe's relationship by having JR try to kill Babe due to a mental breakdown and the belief that he would <b>be</b> <b>saving</b> their son. Not wanting Babe to unjustly die later in life and cause their son the same pain that he went through by losing mother Dixie, or the pain caused by lies, JR reasons that if their son were to lose Babe at an earlier age as opposed to later in life, it will hurt less due to significantly faded memories. In addition, JR was written to fear Babe targeting their son by running away with him and leaving JR without a wife and a child. JR's murder attempt on Babe was a controversial story arc by the writers (see below), further agitated by Babe's willingness to stand by JR even after the murder attempt, later welcome him into her bed, and stand up for him at his attempted murder trial. JR having accidentally harmed best friend Kendall Hart Slater, who subsequently became comatose as a result of the murder attempt, was also ill-received as viewers felt the character should receive jail time. The writers saw the story arc as an opportunity to further the theme of JR and Babe being true loves. To assist this, ABC ran promotional commercials to the original version of the song [...] "Listen to Your Heart" [...] of Babe voicing heartbreak at knowing JR tried to kill her interspersed with the couple enduring it all.|$|E
