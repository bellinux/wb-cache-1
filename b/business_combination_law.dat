40|$|How do {{bondholders}} {{view the}} existence of an open market for corporate control? Between 1985 and 1991, 30 states in the U. S. enacted <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> (BC) <b>laws,</b> raising the cost of corporate takeovers. Relying on these exogenous events, we estimate the influence of the market for corporate control on the cost of debt. We identify different channels through which an open market for corporate control can benefit or harm bondholders: a reduction in managerial slack or the "quiet life," resulting in higher profitability and firm value; a coinsurance effect, in which firms become less risky after being acquired; and an increasing leverage effect, in which bondholder wealth is expropriated through leverage-increasing takeovers. Consistent with the first two mechanisms, we find that the cost of debt rose after the passage of the BC laws; moreover, it rose sharply for firms in non-competitive industries, and for firms rated speculative-grade. In contrast, there is virtually no effect for firms in competitive industries, or firms rated investment-grade.

40|$|By {{reducing}} {{the threat of}} a hostile takeover, <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> (BC) <b>laws</b> weaken corporate governance and increase the opportunity for managerial slack. Consistent with the notion that competition mitigates managerial slack, we find that while firms in non-competitive industries experience a significant drop in operating performance after the laws' passage, firms in competitive industries experience no significant effect. When we examine which agency problem competition mitigates, we find evidence in support of a "quiet-life" hypothesis. Input costs, wages, and overhead costs all increase after the laws' passage, and only so in non-competitive industries. Similarly, when we conduct event studies around the dates of the first newspaper reports about the BC laws, we find that while firms in non-competitive industries experience a significant stock price decline, firms in competitive industries experience a small and insignificant stock price impact. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} empirically how {{the performance}} correlation of firms within an industry affects {{the degree to}} which product market competition mitigates agency problems. Using the passage of state anti-takeover laws as a source of identifying exogenous variation in corporate governance, I find that in homogeneous industries the effect of <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> (BC) <b>laws</b> on firms’ operating performance varies inversely with the level of competition, while in heterogeneous industries all firms experience a decline in operating performance, not varying with industry competition. I find similar results on stock prices when examining the stock market reactions of the first newspaper reports of BC laws. My results are also robust to the use of firm-level corporate governance measures (e. g. G-index).

40|$|We {{examine how}} state antitakeover laws affect {{bondholders}} {{and the cost}} of debt, and report four findings. First, bonds issued by firms incorporated in takeover-friendly states have significantly higher at-issue yield spreads than bonds issued by firms in states with restrictive antitakeover laws. Second, firms in takeover friendly states have significantly higher leverage than their counterparts in restrictive law states. Third, bond issues are associated with negative average stock price reactions among firms in takeover-friendly states, but positive stock price reactions among firms in restrictive law states. Fourth, existing bond values increase, on average, upon the introduction of <b>Business</b> <b>Combination</b> antitakeover <b>law.</b> These results indicate that state antitakeover laws tend to decrease bond yields and increase bond values, which is the opposite of their effect on equity values. This, in turn, implies that state laws help mitigate the agency cost of debt by shielding bondholders from expropriation in takeovers. Overall, the empirical evidence suggests that the effect of antitakeover provisions on firm value must take into account the impacts of both bondholders and stockholders.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two essays on the impacts product market competition has on the real investment efficiency of firms. While the first essay looks at this question through the corporate governance angle and finds product market competition complements institutional investors in disciplining firms, the latter one studies the impacts from an information production {{point of view and}} concludes competition reduces the incentive of firms to acquire information thereby reduces investment efficiency. Using product market competition as a proxy for external corporate governance, the first essay documents a sizeable difference between the governance impact of institutional investors on firms with strong and weak external corporate governance. Higher institutional ownership is associated with real efficiency of firms, but only when external corporate governance is strong. The real efficiency is reflected in higher investment sensitivity to investment opportunities and higher firm value. Utilizing the passing of <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> <b>laws</b> as a negative shock to external corporate governance, the essay identifies that firms with higher institutional ownership suffer a larger decrease in real efficiency, suggesting external corporate governance such as product market competition is critical for institutional investors in disciplining firms. The second essay attempts to figure out the impact of product market competition from an ex ante point of view. Specifically, how does product market competition change the incentive of firms to acquire information about investment opportunities ex ante? The essay provides both a model and a series of extensive empirical tests. The model features a two-stage Bayesian game in differentiated products market competition. This essay finds that competition causes firms to acquire less information and that investment becomes more inefficient in competitive industries. Empirically investment efficiency is measured by a latent variable technique and related to competition using a Herfindahl-Hirschman index as well as more exogenous measure such as trade costs. The panel regression analysis provides strong support for the theory and shows that investment is more efficient in concentrated industries. published_or_final_versionEconomics and FinanceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
30|$|This {{leads us}} to an eclectic view that {{explicitly}} recognizes various contingencies that shape both {{the costs and benefits}} of shifting power from shareholders to managers via ATPs. We refer to this as the differential effect hypothesis. This hypothesis contends that the wealth effect of ATPs differs across firms according to firm-specific characteristics and a firm’s governance environment. Several researchers have examined the heterogeneous effects of ATPs on firm policies and stock returns. For example, Dittmar and Mahrt-Smith (2007) and Harford et al. (2008) show that the value of cash holdings and investment policies depend on a firm’s governance quality measured by the number of ATPs. Using the passage of the <b>Business</b> <b>Combination</b> (BC) <b>law</b> as an exogenous shock to governance, Giroud and Mueller (2010) finds that the law adversely affected operating performance and stock market responses only for firms in non-competitive industries. Similarly, Kadyrzhanova and Rhodes-Kropf (2011) note that the types of ATPs interact with industry characteristics in determining the target premium, the deterrence effect, and firm value. Cremers and Nair (2005) show that a governance index-based trading strategy produces abnormal returns only when public pension funds or large blockholders have a higher ownership stake.|$|R
40|$|Threat {{of hostile}} takeovers can impair {{the ability of}} firms to commit to {{long-term}} relationships with important stakeholders, adversely affecting performance. We use the passage of <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> (BC) <b>laws</b> on a state-by-state basis {{as a source of}} exogenous reduction in the threat of a hostile takeover to show that this results in a significant increase in ROA for firms that have important product market relationships in the form of largecorporate customers. We suggest that since a hostile takeover can disrupt relationships, a reduction in takeover probability allows the supplier to commit to longer term relationships with these customers. As a result, the supplier is able to get lucrative projects from the customer which it could not when its takeover probability was higher. This results in an improvement in operating performance of the supplier. We provide further support by showing that there is an increase in sales for the supplier and an increase in proportion of sales to large customers after the passage of BC law in its state. We also find that a reduction in threat of takeover leads to a strengthening of the customer-supplier relationship. This is reflected by (a) greater probability of continuation of a relationship, (b) greater sensitivity of supplier’s performance to that of the customer, and (c) greater sensitivity of the supplier’s investment to that of the customers, suggesting that the supplier undertakes more investments on behalf of the customer. While a sizeable literature suggests that shareholders would always prefer greater vulnerability to hostile takeovers as it reduces agency problems, our results imply that this may not be true for firms for which ability to commit to long-term relationship with stakeholders is important...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{addresses}} {{two distinct}} aspects of disharmony in {{international accounting standards}} setting. The first aspect relates to the political economic context of financial accounting standards. This {{is illustrated by the}} Chinese standards setters’ decision to allow the pooling of interests method of accounting for <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> despite the prohibition of this method by both the FASB and the IASB. This decision by the Chinese standards setters appears to have been based on political economic factors related to the need for industrial reorganization in China rather than a desire to serve the needs of global capital markets. The second aspect of disharmony relates to the role played by differential understandings of the fundamental objectives of financial reporting in an international context. The IASB’s goal of producing one set of global accounting standards to serve the needs of global capital markets has led to a {{reduction in the number of}} permissible accounting methods and a move towards the fair value accounting model. In particular, the IASB concluded that the acquisition method of accounting for <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> should be the only method allowed for <b>business</b> <b>combinations.</b> In contrast, the Chinese standards setters have recognized the existence of both mergers and acquisitions, and in response they created two different methods of accounting for <b>business</b> <b>combinations.</b> Effectively, the Chinese standards setters developed an alternative approach to accounting for <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> which challenges the IASB’s goal of achieving international accounting convergence through the fair value model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} value {{relevance}} of fair value accounting for non-financial tangible and intangible {{assets in the}} United States by examining the association of asset recognitions and revaluations accompanying <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> with future performance. Asset recognitions and revaluations are measured as components of acquisition premia generated in <b>business</b> <b>combinations.</b> Future performance is measured as subsequent-period changes in operating income and changes in operating cash flows. The paper addresses three related research questions. First, to what extent are the components of acquisition premium generated in a <b>business</b> <b>combination</b> associated with the stock price of the combined firm? Second, do the components of acquisition premium reflect changes in future performance, where performance is measured as operating income and operating cash flows? And, third, does the accounting treatment in <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> result in differential associations of the components of acquisition premium with stock prices or changes in future performance? I find that, consistent with prior research, acquisition premia generated in <b>business</b> <b>combinations</b> are positively associated with the market values of equity of the combined firms. Also, I find acquisition premia generated in purchase transactions are positively associated with changes in future operating income and cash flows from operations. However, acquisition premia generated in pooling transactions are not associated with changes in future performance. I conclude that the value relevance of fair value accounting for non-financial assets depends in part on the context in which it is valued. ...|$|R
