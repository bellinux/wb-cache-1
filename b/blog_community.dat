40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} identifying dynamic logical <b>blog</b> <b>communities</b> based on the distinct interests shared by <b>blogs</b> in the <b>communities.</b> This paper is motivated by the facts that the blog space is highly dynamic both in the participating bloggers and in the interests/issues of concern to them in their blogs, and that many organizations are interested in identifying the evolution/emergence of various <b>blog</b> <b>communities</b> and the current interests/issues of concern to the <b>blogs</b> of those <b>communities.</b> Using dynamic shared distinct interests to define logical <b>blog</b> <b>communities</b> allows us to better identify and track the issues of concern to the bloggers than using statically chosen keywords or statically defined <b>blog</b> <b>communities.</b> The paper discusses algorithms to solve the above problem, which attempt to maximize discriminativeness and diversity of the distinct interests of the <b>blog</b> <b>communities.</b> Experiments are reported to evaluate {{the performance of the}} algorithms and to demonstrate their utility...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} of this thesis is to introduce the idea of brand <b>blogging</b> <b>community.</b> Brand <b>blogging</b> <b>community</b> is identified as an online brand community, where bloggers, brand representatives, and readers act together and commonly form a <b>community</b> that produces <b>blog</b> content. This thesis contributes to a research gap in brand community research, and aims to complement the research field by establishing a lacking definition for this specific type of brand community. The research defines what a brand <b>blogging</b> <b>community</b> is, what characteristics it has, for what purposes bloggers participate in them, and what drives reader affection towards them. The theoretical background for brand <b>blogging</b> <b>community</b> concept is grounded by consumer behavior, marketing, sociological research, and new media studies, and the analytical framework is mainly formed upon theories about brand communities, and value co-creation. Methodology: This research is carried out in a qualitative manner, and it is interpretative in nature. The research focuses on investigating two Scandinavian case communities; Lily. fi and Nouw. com. The research is carried out using netnographic research method, supported with four interviews with two bloggers, a blog reader, and a brand representative. Key Findings: This research finds out that brand <b>blogging</b> <b>community</b> is a multi-dimensional community that is constructed with brand elements, a technical web platform, social factors, and functional and personal motives of readers and bloggers. The basic characteristics for a brand <b>blogging</b> <b>community</b> are brand elements, communal spirit, and a content promoting website. Bloggers participate in brand <b>blogging</b> <b>communities</b> from social integration purposes, image purposes and because of a personal interest towards blogging in general, or the brand. For readers, brand <b>blogging</b> <b>communities</b> are attractive because they serve selected, relevant blog content, are linked with a recognizable brand, and have a detectable sprit. This research proves that brand <b>blogging</b> <b>communities</b> are specific type of brand communities, which create significant value for consumers and companies...|$|R
