50|$|The short {{wavelengths}} also allow high gain antennas to be conveniently small. High gain antennas for point-to-point communication links and UHF television reception are usually Yagi, log periodic, corner reflectors, or reflective array antennas. At {{the top end}} of the <b>band</b> <b>slot</b> antennas and parabolic dishes become practical. For satellite communication, helical, and turnstile antennas are used since satellites typically employ circular polarization which is not sensitive to the relative orientation of the transmitting and receiving antennas. For television broadcasting specialized vertical radiators that are mostly modifications of the slot antenna or helical antenna are used: the slotted cylinder, zig-zag, and panel antennas.|$|E
50|$|The band's October 2004 {{release of}} their second album, Secondhand Opinions, {{presented}} {{a different direction}} from the pop-punk roots of Maybe One Day with a more mature-sounding musical approach.

50|$|Tormé was {{influenced}} by Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Rory Gallagher, and Gary Moore of Thin Lizzy and formed his own band at a young age. His first paid performance came when Don Harris, a 14-year-old drummer he played alongside when he was 17, secured a gig at the local Girl Guides' dance in Kilmainham in Dublin. Tormé then played in Dublin band 'The Urge' in the early 1970s before relocating to London in 1974, where he initially played with heavy rockers 'Scrapyard' (whose bass player, John McCoy would later be re-united with Tormé in Gillan), before forming the punk 'Bernie Tormé Band' in 1976. The Bernie Tormé Band toured with The Boomtown Rats and Generation X among many others. Tormé has since revealed that he secured the supporting <b>band</b> <b>slot</b> with the Boomtown Rats by agreeing to go around London putting up posters advertising the tour.|$|E
5000|$|In 1992, when U2 {{released}} their single [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing", Paul Oakenfold's [...] "Perfecto Mix", {{named for}} his record label Perfecto Records founded in 1989, reached a higher charted {{position in the}} UK Singles Chart than the original version, reaching number 8 whereas the original reached number 12. In 1993 {{with the success of}} his last remix as Perfecto, he was hired by U2 to provide a DJ set in a support <b>band</b> <b>slot</b> on their innovative Zoo TV Tour, replacing BP Fallon on the 1993 legs in Europe and Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, with more than fifty shows on the [...] "Zooropa '93" [...] and [...] "Zoomerang" [...] legs from 7 May to 10 December of the same year. Arguably at his biggest sense of exposure so far, it was also at this time he began producing his own tracks as well, and after visiting in the beaches of Goa in India, he began blending their native Goa music, fusing it with similar-sounding European tracks to create his own distinct sound. The term for this style of music became known as goa trance, and predated the typical current usage for the term trance music. Goa trance is characterised by making heavy use of melodies and synthesizers in its structure, as opposed to the bass lines and rhythms of house music that was prevalent in UK nightclubs. Goa trance was also typified by having faster beats per minute (BPM) than most other genres of dance music.|$|E

Single slot need to be designed and optimized for resonance frequency and use the same slot in designing the linear array, optimize the inter element spacing, slot dimensions and slot locations to achieve the desired VSWR bandwidth over whole frequency band of operation. Mutual coupling effect has to be taken care in designing for improving active return loss and radiation efficiency.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a compact triple <b>band</b> <b>slot</b> microstrip patch antenna for 1. 7 / 2. 92 GHz WLAN applications. The radiating {{element of the}} proposed antenna consists of Swastika symbol slot operating at 1. 8 GHz, 2. 09 GHz, and 2. 92 GHz bands. The antenna size is very compact (50 mm x 50 mm x 1. 6 mm) and covers 1. 8 GHz to 2. 92 GHz {{and can be used}} for AMPS, GSM and WLAN applications. The antenna is fed from a single 50 Ω coaxial cable. Using IE 3 D software package of Zeland, according to the set size, the antenna is simulated. The composite effect of integrating these techniques and by introducing the novel slotted patch offers a low profile, wide bandwidth, high gain and compact antenna element.

40|$|Spectroscopic {{observations}} {{with the}} EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode have revealed {{large areas of}} high speed outflows at the periphery of many solar active regions. These outflows are of interest because they may connect to the heliosphere {{and contribute to the}} solar wind. In this Letter we use slit rasters from EIS in combination with narrow <b>band</b> <b>slot</b> imaging to study the temperature dependence of an active region outflow and show that it is more complicated than previously thought. Outflows are observed primarily in emission lines from Fe XI - Fe XV. Observations at lower temperatures (Si VII), in contrast, show bright fan-like structures that are dominated by downflows. The morphology of the outflows is also different than that of the fans. This suggests that the fan loops, which often show apparent outflows in imaging data, are contained on closed field lines and are not directly related to the active region outflows.
