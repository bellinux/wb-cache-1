6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> not Frank Headley with them, when he {{is needed}} most? And <b>why</b> <b>are</b> Valencia's eyes more red with weeping than even her sister's sorrow need have made them? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Welcome, Peter!" [...] {{he cried}} in a jolly voice. [...] "I {{knew you were}} here, for I saw the horses; <b>but</b> <b>why</b> <b>are</b> you not with Margaret?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why {{it is more}} splendid than my own!' exclaimed the king, looking {{round on}} all the {{beautiful}} things that filled the hall. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>are</b> there no servants?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very good," [...] {{answered}} Margaret, [...] "I will come. Go, tell my father, {{that he may}} join us. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>are</b> you so disturbed and hurried?" [...] {{she added}} wonderingly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cheer up, my dears," [...] said Jack, {{getting out}} of the saddle. [...] "I have come to take you back to your parents. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>are</b> you bound to that tree?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Much {{is spoken}} now about downing of several Georgian {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles over Abkhazia. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> not anyone saying {{anything about the}} fact, that existing agreements prohibit flights over this conflict territory? ...|$|R
