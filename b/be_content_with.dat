5|$|From the start, Habré {{isolated}} {{himself from}} {{the other members of}} the GUNT, which he treated with disdain. Habré's hostility for Libya's influence in Chad united itself with his ambition and ruthlessness: observers concluded that the warlord would never <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>with</b> anything short of the highest office. It was thought that sooner or later an armed confrontation between Habré and the pro-Libyan factions would take place, and more importantly, between Habré and Goukouni.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the main line was stated to have overrun estimated costs considerably, and at a shareholders' meeting in February 1841 it was stated that as a result, the Kilmarnock branch could not be started until authority for additional capital had been obtained, {{and of course the}} money actually raised. Kilmarnock had to <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>with</b> a coach connection until the line there from Dalry Junction opened on 4 April 1843.|$|E

5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's {{philosophy of the}} sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} the poem is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of the poem is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited in our ability to understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>with</b> our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a local {{businessman}} named Louis Edwards began accruing {{shares in}} Manchester United and was eventually made chairman on Hardman's death in 1965. His son, Martin Edwards, purchased {{a percentage of}} shares from Alan Gibson – son of former owner James Gibson – and became the majority shareholder and chairman when Louis Edwards died in 1980. During Martin Edwards' time as chairman, Manchester United {{was the subject of}} several takeover bids; the first came from media tycoon Robert Maxwell, who bid £10million in February 1984, but the sale fell through before any serious talks could take place. In 1989, property magnate Michael Knighton {{was on the verge of}} completing a £20million takeover, but his financial backers pulled out at the last minute and he had to <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>with</b> merely a seat on the board.|$|E
5|$|The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles {{was founded}} in 1977 by Rabbi Marvin Hier using large {{donations}} from philanthropists Samuel Belzberg and Joseph Tennenbaum. Hier's organisation paid Wiesenthal an honorarium {{for the right to}} use his name. The center helped with the campaign to remove the statute of limitations on Nazi crimes and continues the hunt for suspected Nazi war criminals, but today its primary activities include Holocaust remembrance, education, and fighting antisemitism. The center's Holocaust museum, the largest in the United States, opened in 1993. Moriah Films, the center's media division, has won two Academy Awards, including one for the documentary Genocide (1982). Wiesenthal was not always happy with the way the center was run. He thought the museum was not dignified enough and that he should have a larger say in the overall operations. He even wrote to the Board of Directors requesting Hier's removal, but in the end had to <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>with</b> being a figurehead.|$|E

25|$|When {{the rule}} of law is absent, or private {{property}} is non-existent, farmers have little incentive to improve their productivity. If a farm becomes noticeably more productive than neighboring farms, it may become the target of individuals well connected to the government. Rather than risk being noticed and possibly losing their land, farmers may <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>with</b> the perceived safety of mediocrity.|$|E

25|$|The Church Law of 1539 {{contains}} Denmark's first educational legislation with {{a formal}} requirement for schools in all provincial boroughs.

25|$|Three expeditions against Burma, in 1277, 1283, and 1287, {{brought the}} Mongol {{forces to the}} Irrawaddy Delta, whereupon they {{captured}} Bagan, {{the capital of the}} Pagan Kingdom and established their government. Kublai had to <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>with</b> establishing a formal suzerainty, but Pagan finally became a tributary state, sending tributes to the Yuan court until the Mongols were expelled from China in the 1360s. Mongol interests in these areas were commercial and tributary relationships.|$|E

25|$|The two {{headings}} of {{the tunnel}} workings met on 4 June 1976 when two pilot tunnels were drilled through {{to the other side}} to check the alignment. Though the official hole-through ceremony had been planned for 17 June, the dignitaries had to <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>with</b> shovelling some of the rubble as the TBM had again jammed with loose rock. Mr. L. Dillon, a project supervisor, became the first person to walk the tunnel end-to-end on 21 June.|$|E
25|$|Essex's army, {{for want}} of {{material}} resources, had had to <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>with</b> the capture of Reading.

Waller, the only Parliamentary commander left in the field in the west, had to abandon his conquests in the Severn valley to oppose the further progress of his intimate friend and present enemy, Hopton.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} that the Army of the Holy War and the Palestinian forces were in was worse. They could {{not rely on}} any form of foreign support and had to get by on the funds that Mohammad Amin al-Husayni could raise. The troops' armament was limited to what the fighters already had. To make things even worse, they had to <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>with</b> arms bought {{on the black market}} or pillaged from British warehouses, and, as a result, did not really have enough arms to wage war.|$|E

25|$|Because of Judea's {{status as}} a Roman client kingdom, Herod's plans for the {{succession}} had to be ratified by Augustus. The three heirs therefore travelled to Rome to make their claims, Antipas arguing he ought to inherit the whole kingdom and the others maintaining that Herod's final will ought to be honored. Despite qualified support for Antipas from Herodian family members in Rome, who favoured direct Roman rule of Judea but considered Antipas preferable to his brother, Augustus largely confirmed the division of territory set out by Herod in his final will. Archelaus had, however, to <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>with</b> the title of ethnarch rather than king.|$|E
25|$|September {{started with}} a two-day draw with Australia, before Essex beat Lancashire by 55 runs in the National League. Lancashire came back in the Championship, though, beating Essex inside three days to leave Essex 10.5 points adrift of the third-placed Yorkshire – who had a game in hand. Yorkshire drew that game, earning 12 points to {{increase}} the distance to 22.5 points, resulting in Essex' promotion chances slimming to exactly zero. Essex had to <b>be</b> <b>content</b> <b>with</b> a National League victory, cementing the already confirmed title with a win over Worcestershire, before a Championship draw with Worcestershire and a seven-wicket League win over Northamptonshire rounded off the season.|$|E
