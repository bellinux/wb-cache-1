In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the system nonlinear instability and uncertainty inherent in magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems,</b> two PID neural network controllers (BP-based and GA-based) are designed and trained to emulate the operation of a complete system. Through the theoretical deduction and simulation results, the principles for the parameters choice of two neural network controllers are given. The feasibility of using the neural network to control nonlinear magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems</b> with un-known dynamics is demonstrated. The robust performance and reinforcement learning capability in controlling magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems</b> are compared between two PID neural network controllers. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} of narrowband control theory for simple, open-loop stable systems are illustrated, {{and how the}} approach changes for magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems,</b> which are open-loop unstable, is discussed. Magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems</b> are good applications for narrowband control theory. Two sources of synchronous forces, the measurement error and the magnetic unbalance, are discussed. Both the measurement error and the magnetic unbalance manifest themselves as synchronous disturbances. It is shown that narrowband control theory for simple, open-loop stable systems provides excellent performance and good stability robustness. Because magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems</b> are open-loop stable, the narrowband control approach becomes more complex. Disturbance accommodating control (DAC) theory is introduced as an effective approach to reduce vibrations in magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems.</b> It is used to develop a control/estimation scheme that enables the rotor to spin about its center of mass {{in the presence of}} the measurement error disturbances...|$|R

A {{solution to this}} problem is to include at some upper story a large mass, constrained, but free to move within a limited range, and moving on some sort of <b>bearing</b> <b>system</b> such as an air cushion or hydraulic film. Hydraulic pistons, powered by electric pumps and accumulators, are actively driven to counter the wind forces and natural resonances. These may also, if properly designed, be effective in controlling excessive motion – with or without applied power – in an earthquake. In general, though, modern steel frame high rise buildings are not as subject to dangerous motion as are medium rise (eight to ten story) buildings, as the resonant period of a tall and massive building is longer than the approximately one second shocks applied by an earthquake.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2008 by SAGE PublicationsMagnetic {{bearings}} use magnetic {{forces to}} support various machine components. Because of the non-contact {{nature of this}} type of suspension, magnetic bearing technology offers a number of significant advantages over conventional bearings, such as rolling element and fluid film bearings. An active magnetic bearing basically consists of an electromagnetic actuator, position sensors, power amplifiers, and a feedback controller. All of these components are characterized by nonlinear behavior and therefore the entire system is inherently nonlinear. However, in simulations of the dynamic behavior of magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems,</b> the nonlinearities are usually neglected to simplify the analysis and only linear models are used. Moreover, many control techniques currently used in magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems</b> are generally designed by ignoring nonlinear effects. The main reason for simplification is the intractability of the complexity of the actual model. In fact, the inherent nonlinear properties of magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems</b> can lead to dynamic behavior of a magnetically suspended rotor that is distinctly different from that predicted using a simple linearized model. Therefore, the nonlinearities should be taken into account. This literature review is focused on the nonlinear dynamics of magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems</b> and it provides background information on analytical methods, nonlinear vibrations resulting from a rotor contacting auxiliary bearings, and other active topics of research involving the nonlinear properties of magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems,</b> such as nonlinear self-sensing magnetic bearings and nonlinear control of magnetic bearings.

It is essential to detect bearing faults early to avoid unexpected breakdown of plant due to undetected faulty bearings. Many meta-heuristics techniques for condition {{diagnosis of}} single <b>bearing</b> <b>systems</b> have been developed.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) {{are one of the}} most popular methods for classification in condition diagnosis of <b>bearing</b> <b>systems.</b> Regarding to ANNs performance, ANNs parameters have important role especially connectivity weights. In several running of learning processes with the same structure of ANNs, we can obtain different accuracy significantly since initial weights are selected randomly. Therefore, finding the best weights in learning process is an important task for obtaining good performance of ANNs. Previous researchers have proposed some methods to get the best weights such as simple average and majority voting. However, these methods have some limitations in providing the best weights especially in condition diagnosis of <b>bearing</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper, we propose a hybrid technique of multiple classifier-ANNs (mANNs) and adaptive probabilities in genetic algorithms (APGAs) to obtain the best weights of ANNs in order to increase the classification performance of ANNs in condition diagnosis of <b>bearing</b> <b>systems.</b> The mANNs are used to provide several best initial weights which are optimized by APGAs. The set optimized weights from APGAs, afterward, are used as the best weights for condition diagnosis.

Conditions of bearings commonly are reflected by vibration signals data.

However, large number of features extraction will increase the complexity of the diagnosis system. Therefore, in this paper, we presented a diagnosis method which is hybridization of adaptive genetic algorithms (AGAs), back propagation neural networks (BPNNs), and grey relational analysis (GRA) to diagnose the condition of multiple <b>bearings</b> <b>system.</b> AGAs are used in the diagnosis algorithm to determine the best initial weights of BPNNs in order to improve the diagnosis accuracy.
