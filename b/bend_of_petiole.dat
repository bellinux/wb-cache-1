40|$|The {{identification}} of nutrient deficiency symptoms in lettuce helps both producers and technical staff {{to keep the}} plant nutritional balance in their producing areas. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate production and describe and record the visual symptoms caused by the isolated or combined shortage of K, Ca, B and Zn in crisphead lettuce grown in hydroponics. The experimental design was completely randomized blocks with four replications and eight treatments, representing the single (K, Ca, B, Zn) and combined (Ca and B, K and Zn, B and Zn) omission of nutrients, with a control treatment containing a complete nutrient solution. We used the crisphead lettuce cultivar Rider Plus. Under Ca shortage, plant growth was reduced and chlorosis appeared in the borders of young leaves. K shortage was the most detrimental to production of shoot fresh and dry matter and root dry matter. Where B was absent, plant growth was limited, the apical dominance was lost and leaves became wrinkled. Plants without Zn showed mild chlorosis in the blade of young leaves, elongation and <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> <b>petioles</b> and reduction in root density. The combined omission of Ca and B slowed down plant growth and induced necrosis at the borders of young leaves, while the combined omission of K and Zn initially induced K deficiency symptoms with reduced growth. When B and Zn were simultaneously subtracted, plants first showed B deficiency symptoms: reduction in plant size as compared to the control treatment and death of the apical bud...|$|R

60|$|Clematis vitalba.--The {{plants were}} in pots and not healthy, so that I dare not trust my observations, which {{indicate}} much similarity in habits with C. flammula. I mention this species only because I have seen many proofs that the petioles {{in a state}} of nature are excited to movement by very slight pressure. For instance, I have found them embracing thin withered blades of grass, the soft young leaves of a maple, and the flower-peduncles of the quaking-grass or Briza. The latter are about as thick as the hair of a man's beard, but they were completely surrounded and clasped. The <b>petioles</b> <b>of</b> a leaf, so young that none of the leaflets were expanded, had partially seized a twig. Those of almost all the old leaves, even when unattached to any object, are much convoluted; but this is owing to their having come, whilst young, into contact during several hours with some object subsequently removed. With none of the above-described species, cultivated in pots and carefully observed, was there any permanent <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> the <b>petioles</b> without the stimulus of contact. In winter, the blades of the leaves of C. vitalba drop off; but the petioles (as was observed by Mohl) remain attached to the branches, sometimes during two seasons; and, being convoluted, they curiously resemble true tendrils, such as those possessed by the allied genus Naravelia. The petioles which have clasped some object become much more stiff, hard, and polished than those which have failed in this their proper function.|$|R

40|$|Rumex palustris {{responds}} to submergence with an upward <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> the <b>petioles</b> (hyponastic growth) {{followed by a}} strong enhancement of elongation <b>of</b> the entire <b>petiole.</b> These two growth responses together help the plant to regain contact with the water surface, so that gas exchange to the submerged tissue can be restored. The underwater escape response is initiated by ethylene, which accumulates inside the submerged tissue (Voesenek et al., 1993). Almost immediately after submergence, ethylene induces {{a reduction in the}} concentration of abscisic acid (ABA, Chapter 2), via an increase in ABA catabolism and a depression of ABA biosynthesis. Externally applied ABA can almost fully inhibit underwater growth, while an artificial reduction in ABA enhances the elongation response by shortening the distinct lag phase between the start of submergence and the start of faster elongation growth. Submergence of the submergence-intolerant R. acetosa, a species related to R. palustris but incapable of enhanced submergence-induced elongation, does not lead to a decrease in ABA (Chapter 2). ABA is still a negative regulator of enhanced growth even in R. acetosa, as fluridone treatment permits enhanced underwater extension growth in submerged R. acetosa. Air-grown R. acetosa does not show enhanced elongation upon fluridone treatment. Since pre-treatment with the ethylene action inhibitor 1 -MCP does not prevent underwater elongation in fluridone-treated R. acetosa, there must be a submergence signal other than ethylene that stimulates the <b>petioles</b> <b>of</b> R. acetosa to extend rapidly. Whatever the signal eventually proves to be, it is seemingly inactive in R. palustris, where submergence-induced elongation can be inhibited fully by 1 -MCP. In R. palustris, submergence induces an up-regulation of the concentration of GA 1. This up-regulation results predominantly from increased transcription of RpGA 3 ox 1, a gibberellin biosynthesis gene the product of which catalyses the final enzymatic step to form GA 1 (Chapter 4). Submergence induces an acidification of the apoplast <b>of</b> <b>petiole</b> cells, mediated by an increase in H+ efflux activity (Chapter 5). This acidification process facilitates the action of cell wall-loosening proteins, such as the expansin RpExp 1. The submergence-induced apoplastic acidification is found to be independent of ABA as it takes place prior to a decrease in ABA concentration, and externally applied ABA fails to inhibit the acidification (Chapter 2 and 5). Thus, in the signal transduction pathway of submergence-induced elongation, apoplastic acidification and RpEXP 1 expression are placed downstream of ethylene, but parallel to ABA (Fig. 1). Hyponastic growth Hyponastic growth is {{an important component of the}} underwater escape mechanism in R. palustris. The response is regulated by ABA. Application of this hormone to submerged plants inhibits hyponastic growth, while pre-treatment with fluridone induces an enhanced hyponastic response in submerged or ethylene-treated plants (Chapter 3). Arabidopsis thaliana {{responds to}} ethylene (5 µL L- 1) with a hyponastic growth response (Millenaar et al., unpublished). This process is thought to consist of enhanced cell extension on the abaxial side <b>of</b> the <b>petiole.</b> The magnitude <b>of</b> this response varies strongly Columbia- 0 (Col), showing strong hyponastic growth, and Landsberg erecta (Ler) showing little hyponasty. Aba negatively influence petiole angles. ABA and fluridone were less effective in altering hyponasty in Ler than in Col. Ethylene did not decrease ABA in <b>petioles</b> <b>of</b> ethylene-treated Arabidopsis. However, ethylene did increase the transcript abundance of ABI 1, a negative regulator of ABA signal transduction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Increased {{cell number}} and cell length both {{contribute}} to shade induced elon-gation <b>of</b> <b>petioles</b> which enables stoloniferous plants {{to place their}} leaf lamina higher up in the canopy. Although petiole elongation {{is assumed to be}} beneficial, it may also imply costs in terms of decreased biomechanical stability. We test the hypothesis that shade induced elongation changes the biomechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>petioles</b> and that the under-lying mechanisms, cell division and cell elongation, differentially affect biomechanical properties. This was done by subjecting 14 genotypes differing in the relative contribution of cell size and cell number to shade induced elongation responses to high light conditions and to simulated canopy shade. Developmental traits (cell size and cell number), mor-phological traits characterizing the petioles, as well as biomechanical characteristics were measured.
