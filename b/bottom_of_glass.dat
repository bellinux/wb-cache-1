After pre-washing with water and ethanol, the Petri dish bottom was covered with TiO 2 powder suspended in water (1 mg cm- 2) and dried at room temperature.

30|$|The {{colloidal}} stability of Fe-Pd@PGA NPs and bare Fe-Pd NPs was investigated by sedimentation experiments. The bare Fe-Pd NPs aggregated quickly within 10  min, and the visible black sediment {{can be observed}} {{in the bottom of the}} tube (Fig.  2 d). After 120  min, the flotage and generated flocculation formed, which might be attributed to the generation of hydrogen. As expected, the Fe-Pd@PGA NPs were dispersed well and hardly settled down to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> tube for more than 180  min as shown in Fig.  2 c. Additionally, we found that the aggregation of Fe-Pd@PGA NPs occurred after standing for 1  day (Additional file  1 : Figure S 2). The {{colloidal stability}} of Fe-Pd@PGA NPs is comparative and even better than the classical CMC-modified Fe-Pd NPs (e.g., for 5  g L−[*] 1 of CMC-nZVI, the settlement time is 30  min [44]).|$|E

If glass bakeware is chipped, cracked, or scratched, it’s time for it to be retired from service. It is more likely to shatter!

40|$|An optical {{biosensor}} for parallel multi-sample {{determination of}} {{biochemical oxygen demand}} (BOD) in wastewater samples has been developed. The biosensor monitors the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in water through an oxygen sensing film immobilized on the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> sample vials. The oxygen sensing film contains the tris(4, 7 -diphenyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline) ruthenium(II) dye (Ru(dpp)) the luminescence intensity of which varies with oxygen concentration. A computer-controlled moving optrode head with four blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) was scanned sequentially under each sample vial. The luminescence signal was collected by an optical cable and transmitted to a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and processed by a microcomputer. The microbial samples (activated sludge and Bacillus subtilis were immobilized in a sol-gel composite material of silica and poly(vinyl alcohol) -grafted-poly(vinylpyridine) on the oxygen sensing film. The performance of the microbial film {{as a function of}} cell loading, thickness, temperature and pH and in the presence of heavy metals as well as its stability and service life have been investigated. The BOD value was determined from the rate of oxygen consumption by the microorganisms in the first 20 min. The BOD values obtained from this biosensor correlates well with the results of the conventional 5 -day BOD test. Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technolog...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} dextranases (EC 3. 2. 1. 11) from the oral {{isolates}} Actinomyces israelii and Bacteroides ochraceus on water-insoluble glucan production by the Streptococcus mutans dextransucrase (EC 2. 4. 1. 5) and sucrose-dependent adherence to smooth glass surfaces by S. mutans was studied. Collection on membrane filters of water-insoluble polysaccharides synthesized from radioactive sucrose {{was used to}} demonstrate the marked sensitivity of insoluble glucan formation {{to the presence of}} dextranase. Concentrations of A. israelii dextranase as low as 0. 002 U/ml inhibited insoluble glucan formation by 60 %. Similar results were obtained the the B. ochraceus enzyme. An assay for sucrose-stimulated adherence of S. mutans to smooth surfaces involved attachment of radioactively labeled nongrowing cells to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> scintillation vials. This facile and sensitive assay was utilized to demonstrate that sucrose-dependent adherence was affected by low levels of dextranase from either A. israelii or B. ochraceus. Enzyme at 0. 005 U/ml reduced adherence of S. mutans by 80 %. Treatment of S. mutans cells previously attached to glass with low concentrations of the dextranases resulted in removal of 50 % to 60 % of the bacteria. The results indicate that dextranase-producing oral bacteria may affect sucrose-dependent colonization of S. mutans on the tooth surface and offer a possible explanation for both the difficulties involved in implanting this bacterium into the human mouth and the limited intraoral transmission of S. mutans from one tooth surface to another...|$|E
40|$|Ernogrammus hexagrammus (Temminck et Schlegel) {{is a small}} blennioid fish, {{hiding under}} the stones lying in the tidal zone of rocky coasts, distributing from Hokkaido to Kyushu in Japan. The authors {{collected}} the egg masses of this fish at Manju Islet in Shimonoseki City on March 15, 1957, March 7, 1958 and February 24, 1959 and reared the hatched larvae for about 40 days in the glass jar feeding with brine shrimp nauplii. The spawning season seems to extend from January to March {{in the vicinity of}} Shimonoseki City. The eggs (Fig. 2, A) are sticking to each other to form a small spherical egg mass (about 30 mm in diameter), not adherent to any other substance. The spawned egg mass is laid under the stones lying near the low tide water mark, where it is guarded by a male parent fish. The individual egg (Fig. 2, B) is spherical, measuring 2. 3 - 2. 45 mm in diameter with a single oil-globule. The yolk and oil-globule are colorless. The egg membrane is almost opaque and pale milky white with a number of small wartlike structures on the surface. The developing eggs at 47 -myotome stage, with hatching enzyme glands on the head of embryonal body, collected on March 7, 1958, were reared in the tank. The hatching took place in about 8 days after being collected at the water temperature 13 - 17. 5 ℃. The newly hatched larvae (including the one of Fig. 2, C) are 8. 75 - 9. 25 mm in total length, with an oil globule situated at the middle part of the yolk and partly protruding from its surface. The myotome number is 15 + 30 ～ 32 = 45 ～ 47. The larvae fed actively on the brine shrimp nauplii in the day time, but in dark they did not feed at all. In four or five days the yolk was entirely consumed and the larva measured 9. 65 mm (Fig. 2, D). For about twenty days after hatching the larvae lived a swimming life in the day time, settling down to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> jar in the dark place or at night. In 23 days after hatching the rudiments of ventral fins were formed(Fig. 2, F). In 25 - 30 days after hatching, melanophores and orange pigment cells suddenly appeared almost all over the body, and the larvae (including the one of Fig. 2, G), now 12. 7 - 13. 0 mm in total length, entered into the bottom life. These larvae scarcely fed on the brine shrimp nauplii. In 34 days after hatching the larvae (Fig. 2, H), 13 mm in total length, reached early juvenile stage. ムスジカジErnogammus hexagrammmus(TemmincketSchlege 1) はギンポ亜目タウエガジ科Stichaeidaeの小魚で本邦では北海道から九州地方まで分布し,岩礁性海岸の最大干潮線附近の石の下に潜んで棲んでいる. ギンポ亜目魚類の卵及び産卵習性については今まで多くの研究がなされ,卵が卵塊を形成するものと,他物に一層に産みつけられるものとがあり,何れの場合も親魚が卵群を保護することが知られている. しかしムスジガジ及びタウエガジ科の魚の産卵習性や幼期の形態,習性などについてはまだ明らかにされていない. 筆者の一人藤田は 1957 ～ 1959 年の春,下関市長府沖の満珠島の礁で本種の卵塊を採集し, この卵から孵化した仔魚を門司市立和布刈水族館で約 40 日間飼育観察したので産卵習性及び仔稚魚期について報告する...|$|E
