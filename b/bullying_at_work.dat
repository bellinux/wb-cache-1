50|$|The 'social modernisation' bill {{included}} work-related provisions such as {{measures to}} combat 'moral harassment' (<b>bullying)</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> measures to combat precarious employment (through restrictions on fixed-term contracts), and improved accreditation of vocational skills and experience. The law also contained {{a wide range}} of redundancy provisions such as the requirement to convene negotiations on the 35-hour week prior to any redundancy plan, enhanced powers for works councils, a contribution to the regeneration of closed sites by companies with a workforce of over 1,000, nine-month redeployment leave for redundant workers, and the doubling of the minimum redundancy compensation. A law on 'new economic regulations' was passed which aimed at adding an 'ethical' aspect to financial practices, “clarifying competition rules, improving social dialogue and enforcing the rights of consumers.” In terms of industrial relations, the new law strengthened (to some extent) the powers of works councils in takeovers, mergers and proposed share exchanges. The Social and Medical Action Act, introduced in January 2002, provided additional protection for the rights of users of social and social/medical facilities.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{the present}} paper direct as well as {{indirect}} relationships between organizational changes and exposure to <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> are investigated. Interpersonal conflicts are hypothesized to mediate changes on bullying. Data from a sample of 2408 Norwegian employees confirmed that different organizational changes were moderately associated with task-related <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> and that exposure to more changes increased the likelihood of being bullied. Structural equation modelling supported the assumption that changes were directly related to bullying. However, the hypothesis that changes were mediated on bullying through interpersonal conflicts was not supported. Results indicate that organizational changes and interpersonal conflicts are separate, and mainly independent, precursors of <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work...</b>|$|E
40|$|This interpretative phenomenological enquiry {{into the}} {{experience}} of being bullied in the workplace identifies five themes connected to bullying: The Impossible Pendulum, Echoes of Past Bullying, Reframing and Re-blaming of Self, Finding My-”Self” Again and Reframing the Future. Workplace bullying is recognised as a global phenomenon. However, research estimates {{that the vast majority of}} incidents go unreported. One UK study found 50 % of respondents had been <b>bullied</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> or had witnessed others being bullied. Most research focuses on the incidence and typologies of bullying or the impact of bullying on business. Far fewer studies have been conducted qualitatively and even less explored {{the experience of}} being <b>bullied</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 10 co-respondents who had been <b>bullied</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> The interviews were then analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The five interpretative themes were discussed with special reference to Nietzsche’s “master” and “slave” concept, Heidegger’s idea of “unavailableness” and the pivotal role that our experience of the “Other” and our “Other-ness” plays. This research shows that the “lived experience” of workplace bullying can have far-reaching, negative and ongoing effects in an individual’s “life-world”. The findings are also discussed in light of the theoretical and methodological concerns that surround IPA studies. An outline for workplace anti-bullying training is discussed and the contribution this study makes to Counselling Psychology is explored. Implications for future research arising from this study and others are also suggested and discussed...|$|R

40|$|This article aims {{to uncover}} the ways that our {{understanding}} of <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> has become institutionalized. We argue that this institutionalization has limited {{our understanding of the}} ways that bullying is defined, constructed, experienced, resisted, and accounted for in organizations. The research draws on Phillips, Lawrence, and Hardy's Discursive Model of Institutionalization (DMI) when considering various texts about <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> and their role in institutionalizing bullying. As a result of doing this, we draw attention away from the dominant perspectives conceptualizing workplace bullying as an individual or interpersonal issue to explore the wider disputes over definitions and the discursive negotiation of what is and is not <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> within organizations. We investigate how, through the discursive effects of action, texts of bullying are created, legitimized, embedded in discourse, and institutionalized. However, we highlight that resistance challenges the rights to speak, undermines the rationality of claims, and challenges moral evaluation. We demonstrate that DMI is a useful concept for exploring the processes involved in institutionalizing. We show that <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> is a highly complex area where polyphony is important, and we highlight how, through the anchoring in a dominant, individualizing discourse (that usually is taken for granted), workers are produced and reproduced to fit the dominant discourse. We argue that analyzing the texts and discourses of bullying deployed by a broad range of participants at work allows us to observe the processes by which concepts may become institutionalized as well the processes by which they may resist institutionalization...|$|E
40|$|Work {{psychology}} Abstract The present paper {{reviews and}} summarises {{the research and}} literature on the nature and causes of <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Bullying occurs when someone at work is systematically subjected to aggressive behaviour from one or more colleagues or superiors {{over a long period}} of time, in a situation where the target finds it difficult to defend him or herself or to escape the situation. Such treatment tends to stigmatise the target and may even cause severe psychological trauma. Empirical studies on the causes of bullying have concentrated on the personality of the victim and psychosocial factors at work. Most studies treat bullying as a unified phenomenon, in spite of the fact that different kinds of behaviours are involved. The concepts of dispute-related and predatory bullying are introduced in an effort to broaden the perspectives used in future investigations on both the nature and the causes of <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work...</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> {{a severe}} form of anti-social behaviour, {{has become an}} issue of major concern to workers, organisations, unions and governments. It has also {{received}} considerable attention in organisational behaviour and human resource management research over the past 20 + years. Research has been conducted on the prevalence of <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> and factors which contribute to bullying, but less attention has been accorded to personal coping with bullying and organisational-level responses to counteract bullying. The present paper reports findings from a survey of over 1700 employees of 36 organisations in New Zealand. We describe the reported incidence of <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> along with relevant work attitudes and experiences, including psychological strain, ratings of subjective well-being, and levels of commitment to the organisation. Personal experience of bullying was reported by 17. 8 % of respondents, and was significantly correlated {{with higher levels of}} strain, reduced well-being, reduced commitment to their organisation, and lower self-rated performance. Personal coping strategies were generally unrelated to these outcomes. On the other hand, the perceived effectiveness of organisational efforts to deal with bullying was considered an important contributor to both the occurrence of bullying and reduced negative effects of bullying. Overall, our findings illustrate the importance of developing organisational-level strategies to reduce the incidence of bullying and to counteract its negative impact, rather than expecting individuals to develop personal strategies to cope with this problem.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the work unit's conflict management styles and <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Inspired by the Dual Concern framework, the authors assume a positive relationship between avoiding, forcing and yielding and bullying and a negative relationship between problem-solving and bullying. Moreover, they expected these relationships to be intensified by conflict frequency. The results (N = 5062) reveal an unsatisfactory fit when not taking into account conflict frequency as a moderator. A multigroup SEM accounting for the moderating role of conflict frequency (five groups) does yield an acceptable fit: the 'very rarely' and 'yearly' group, and the 'monthly' and 'weekly' group show equal path coefficients. The 'daily' conflict group has its own parameters. Forcing and avoiding associate positively and problem-solving associates negatively with bullying; and these relationships intensify as a function of conflict frequency. There is no relationship between yielding and <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> within the various conflict frequency groups. status: publishe...|$|E

Three groups were defined: bullied (N = 14), witnesses (N = 31) and non-bullied respondents (N = 202). The Swedish universities Scale of Personality was used to assess personality traits related to the three major dimensions of neuroticism, extraversion, and aggressiveness. Bullied persons had higher scores on all six scales within the neuroticism dimension as well as higher irritability (aggressiveness dimension) and impulsiveness scores (extraversion dimension), when compared with their non-bullied work colleagues. To conclude, bullied persons display a self-image that is dominated by mistrust and embitterment as well as irritability and impulsiveness. Accordingly, when dealing with <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> the need for ego-supportive actions should be considered in conjunction with more organisational, collective oriented action...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} explores whether Karasek's Job Demand-Control (JDC) model's strain {{hypothesis}} {{can be applied}} to target's reports of <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in matched samples of Spanish and Belgian blue-collar workers. In the Spanish sample, results reveal a positive main effect of workload and a negative main effect of autonomy. The relationship between workload and bullying is particularly strong under the condition of low autonomy (i. e., interaction), in line with Karasek's strain hypothesis. In the Belgian sample, results show a positive main effect of workload and a significant workload-autonomy interaction effect in accordance with the strain hypothesis. In sum, high strain jobs associate with target's reports of bullying in both the Spanish and Belgian sample. Karasek's JDC model may accordingly be extended to target's reports of bullying as a form of social behavioural strain. These findings furthermore enhance research in the realm of <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> by introducing a well-established theoretical framework to account for the relationship between workload, autonomy, and target's reports of bullying. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{present study}} is a {{sub-project}} of the Danish research project Bullying and Harassment at work: Prevalence, Risk factors, Consequences, Prevention, and Rehabilitation 2006 - 2009 which is a prospective research project initiated by the Danish National Research Centre for the Working Environment. The data material originates from a comprehensive base-line and follow-up questionnaire administered in 2006 and in 2008. The purpose of this quantitative study {{was to assess the}} extent to which <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> would affect those who were not experiencing the direct impact of the bullying behaviour, but who reported to witness the bullying of others in their work unit. Both a cross-sectional and a longitudinal methodological approach were employed in order to investigate both the short- and long-term effects of witnessing <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> In line with results obtained in previous cross-sectional studies, it was expected that the non-bullied witnesses to workplace bullying would experience elevated levels of stress, burnout, psychosomatic symptoms, and state negative affect, and lower levels of general health than a control group. Due to the prospective design of the Workplace Investigation, it was also possible to assess the potential long-term effects of being a witness to <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> by comparing those who reported to witness bullying at both T 1 and T 2 (i. e long-term witnesses) to a control group, previous witnesses, and new witnesses at T 2. The results from the cross-sectional approach revealed that the self-declared witnesses to bullying in 2006 and in 2008 were significantly more affected with regards to all the respective measures than the control group in 2006 and in 2008. The longitudinal analysis, however, yielded both supportive and contradictive results in terms of the stated hypotheses...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} risk of sleep {{problems}} associated with work stress (job strain, job demands, and decision authority), worries and pain and to investigate the synergistic interaction between these factors and traffic noise. Sleep problems and predictor variables were assessed in a cross-sectional public health survey with 12, 093 respondents. Traffic noise levels were assessed using modelled A-weighted energy equivalent traffic sound levels at the residence. The risk of sleep problems was modelled using multiple logistic regression analysis. With regard to sleep problems not attributed to any external source (general sleep problems), independent main effects were found for traffic noise (women), decision authority (women), job strain, job demands, suffering from pain or other afflictions, worries about losing the job, experiencing <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> having troubles paying the bills, and having a sick, disabled, or old relative {{to take care of}} (women). Significant synergistic effects were found for traffic noise and experiencing <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in women. With regard to sleep problems attributed to traffic noise, strong synergistic interactions were found between traffic noise and, respectively, job demands (men), having pain or other afflictions, taking care of a sick, old, or disabled relative, and having troubles paying the bills. Main effects were found for worries about losing the job, experiencing <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> job strain (men), and decision authority (men). Synergistic interactions could potentially contribute with 10 - 20 % of the sleep problems attributed to traffic noise in the population. Work stress, pain, and different worries were independently associated with general sleep problems and showed in general no synergistic interaction with traffic noise. In contrast, synergistic effects between traffic noise and psychological factors were found with regard to sleep problems attributed to traffic noise. The synergy may contribute significantly to sleep problems attributed to traffic noise in the population...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} multicohort {{study was}} to examine whether {{employees}} exposed to social stressors <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> such as workplace bullying and violence, have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The study included 45, 905 men and women (40 - 65 years of age and free of diabetes at baseline) from four studies in Sweden, Denmark and Finland. Workplace bullying and violence were self-reported at baseline. Incident diabetes was ascertained through national health and medication records and death registers. Marginal structural Cox models adjusted for age, sex, country of birth, marital status and educational level were used for the analyses. Nine per cent of the population reported being <b>bullied</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> and 12 % were exposed to workplace violence or threats of violence. Bullied participants had a 1. 46 (95 % CI 1. 23, 1. 74) times higher risk of developing diabetes compared with non-bullied participants. Exposure to violence or threats of violence was also associated with a higher risk of diabetes (HR 1. 26 [95 % CI 1. 02, 1. 56]). The risk estimates attenuated slightly when taking BMI into account, especially for bullying. The results were similar for men and women, and were consistent across cohorts. We found a higher risk of incident type 2 diabetes among employees exposed to bullying or violence in the workplace. Further {{research is needed to determine}} whether policies to reduce <b>bullying</b> and violence <b>at</b> <b>work</b> may reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes in working populations.

40|$|Background: The {{consequences}} of childhood bullying victimisation are serious. Much {{previous research on}} risk factors for being bullied has used a cross-sectional design, impeding the possibility to draw conclusions on causality, and has not considered simultaneous effects of multiple risk factors. Paying closer attention to multiple risk factors for being bullying can {{provide a basis for}} designing intervention programmes to prevent or reduce bullying among children and adolescents. Methods: Risk factors for bullying were examined by using questionnaire data collected in 2004 and 2007. In 2004, the participants were aged 14 – 15 years and 17 – 18 years in 2007. The baseline questionnaire was answered by 3054 individuals in 2004, and 2181 individuals participated in both rounds. We analysed risk factors for being <b>bullied</b> <b>at</b> the individual and societal level. Information on the social background of the participants was derived from a national register at Statistics Denmark. Results: Several risk factors were identified. Being obese, low self-assessed position in school class, overprotective parents, low self-esteem, low sense of coherence and low socioeconomic status were risk factors for being <b>bullied</b> <b>at</b> school. Being overweight, smoking, low self-assessed position in class, low sense of coherence and low socioeconomic status were risk factors for being <b>bullied</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> However, most associations between risk factors in 2004 and being bullied in 2007 disappeared after adjustment for being bullied in 2004. Conclusions: The strongest risk factor for being bullied was being previously bullied. Our results stress the importance of early prevention of <b>bullying</b> <b>at</b> schools. In addition, attention should be drawn to the role of overprotective parents...|$|R
