The highest medieval stone vault in England is at Westminster Abbey at , that at York Minster <b>being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same height but despite its appearance, not actually of stone, but wood.

5|$|Host-parasite mimicry is a {{situation}} where a parasite mimics its own host. As with mimicry of the female sex outlined previously, only two species are involved, the model and mimic <b>being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same species. Brood parasitism, a form of kleptoparasitism where the mother has its offspring raised by another unwitting organism, is one such situation where host-parasite mimicry has evolved. Pasteur terms this form of aggressive-reproductive mimicry Kirbyan mimicry, after the English entomologist William Kirby.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 300,000 horses {{existed in}} Finland when the Finnhorse {{studbook}} {{was established in}} the beginning of the 20thcentury. The horse population, consisting almost entirely of Finnhorses, remained stable for 50 years. The rebuilding of the country after two wars had increased demand for horse power, and by the 1950s, the breed reached its all-time peak, with an estimated 409,000 animals, with a great majority of the horses <b>being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> draught type. However, with the increased mechanisation of agriculture and forestry in the 1960s, the number of Finnhorses dropped precipitously. Horses, having been bred in large numbers only a few years earlier, were taken to slaughter by the thousands; a change in forestry tax policy made previously state-supported horse-powered forestry unprofitable and further discouraged keeping horses. Many working horse bloodlines ended, while lines more suitable for sports and recreation survived. By the 1970s, the breed's numbers had declined to 90,000 animals, and 10 years later as few as 20,000 Finnhorses existed. The breed's all-time lowest point was 1987, with only 14,100 horses. By this time, however, the overall horse population in Finland had been increasing for almost a decade, with lighter harness racing horse breeds establishing their position, counting 12,800 animals the same year.|$|E
5|$|As {{the galactic}} plane passes through it, Serpens Cauda {{contains}} many massive OB stars. Several {{of these are}} {{visible to the naked}} eye, such as NW Serpentis, an early Be star that {{has been found to be}} somewhat variable. The variability is interesting; according to one study, it could be one of the first discovered hybrids between Beta Cephei variables and slowly pulsating B stars. Although not visible to the naked eye, HD 167971 (MY Serpentis) is a Beta Lyrae variable triple system consisting of three very hot O-type stars. A member of the cluster NGC 6604, the two eclipsing stars are both blue giants, with one <b>being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very early spectral type O7.5III. The remaining star is either a blue giant or supergiant of a late O or early B spectral type. Also an eclipsing binary, the HD 166734 system consists of two O-type blue supergiants in orbit around each other. Less extreme in terms of mass and temperature is HD 161701, a spectroscopic binary consisting of a B-type primary and an Ap secondary, although it is the only known spectroscopic binary to consist of a star with excess of mercury and manganese and an Ap star.|$|E

5|$|Some {{computer}} forecast models initially {{predicted that}} the storm would move towards South Carolina or Georgia. Before the storm's arrival in South Carolina, researchers at Clemson University used Bonnie to test a new method of estimating the damage a storm is likely to cause. In the state, the South Carolina National Guard put about 1,512 men on active duty, 1,474 <b>being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Army National Guard. On August 25, the South Carolina Emergency Preparedness Division activated Level 1 operations, the highest of five levels. That same day, the State Governor declared a State of Emergency, calling for mandatory evacuations of residents east of U.S. Route 17 in Horry and Georgetown counties. Schools were closed throughout the state. Over 200,000 people were evacuated from those counties, of which 120,000 were tourists. About 6,000 sought shelter at schools in Horry County. In a survey, 12% of respondents in the state took traffic as a significant consideration in deciding if they should evacuate. On the Grand Strand, Bonnie was the first storm where buses were provided to help people evacuate.|$|E

5|$|The parish {{church of}} St Peter & St Paul is {{situated}} in {{the centre of the}} town. A church has been on the site since at least 1162, although the current tower dates from 1352. The building had fallen into disrepair during the 19th century, and the majority of the building is the result of an intensive restoration in 1910. This included restoring a pitched roof and adding new aisles, although the nave arches are original. In 1935, a new two manual Harrison & Harrison organ was installed, a fine example of a pneumatic action instrument. Recent years have seen the construction of several new facilities, such as the Bricstan room extension.

5|$|The sand whiting is a {{schooling}} species, whose {{movements are}} associated with a variety of factors including prey, lunar patterns and spawning movements; although there appears to be little consistency in its movements in relation to these factors. Studies on the species over the period of a year have shown the species does not change its local distribution {{over the course of a}} day, generally <b>being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same abundance during both night and day. Seasonal abundance due to spawning is variable, with studies conducted in Moreton Bay, Queensland finding the species recruits heavily to shallow waters and increase numbers during winter months, while studies in the Noosa River estuary have shown no difference in numbers recruited over the course of a season. Like other sillaginids, they have the ability to 'burrow' into the sand and remained hidden until a predator or seine net has passed by.|$|E
