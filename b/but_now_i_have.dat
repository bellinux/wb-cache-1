2500|$|As {{a member}} of the team Arena {{performed}} cover versions of popular tracks and in 1977 released a split album, Tiny Tina and Little John, alternating tracks with fellow team member, John Bowles. While with the TV series she appeared in TV specials, at shopping centres or tourist venues. In September 1982 she became a [...] "coach" [...] for new team members, Danielle Minogue and Mark McCormack; Arena told The Australian Women's Weeklys Debbie Byrne that [...] "They seem to be settling down a lot quicker than I did. They both have a really professional attitude."

2500|$|Cantor Rabinowitz {{wants his}} son {{to carry on the}} generations-old family {{tradition}} and become a cantor at the synagogue in the Jewish ghetto of Manhattan's Lower East Side. But down at the beer garden, thirteen-year-old Jakie Rabinowitz is performing so-called jazz tunes. Moisha Yudelson spots the boy and tells Jakie's father, who drags him home. Jakie clings to his mother, Sara, as his father declares, [...] "I'll teach him better than to debase the voice God gave him!" [...] Jakie threatens: [...] "If you whip me again, I'll run away— and never come back!" [...] After the whipping, Jakie kisses his mother goodbye and, true to his word, runs away. At the Yom Kippur service, Rabinowitz mournfully tells a fellow celebrant, [...] "My son was to stand at my side and sing tonight– <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no son." [...] As the sacred Kol Nidre is sung, Jakie sneaks back home to retrieve a picture of his loving mother.|$|E

6000|$|I {{told her}} no; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> met with her my walk {{was not in}} vain. [...] "Though <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen you to-day already," [...] said I, and told her where and when.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> returned. The {{work that}} fate had undone {{must be done}} again, and though I must need smile at my {{imperial}} honors, I none the less {{felt the weight of}} duty and obligation that rested upon my shoulders.|$|R
2500|$|Gillian Chung was {{the first}} starlet to make a public appearance. After a New Year celebration with fans on 11 February, she {{delivered}} a brief statement to the press in which she apologised for the hurt caused to those around her.(English translation: [...] "...This incident has {{caused a lot of}} turmoil and harm to me and people around me. I admit that I was so naive and silly in the past, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> grown up. I thank my company, my family and my friends for their blessing and support. This incident has caused a lot of [...] effects to the society which I deeply regret. In the future, I will continue to work hard, and face my life positively." [...] Emperor sought closure by stating that neither it nor any of its artists would be making any further statement about the incident. The press conference drew mixed response from the media and the public. An Apple Daily commentary was particularly scathing about the hypocrisy of Chung and of her management company for only obliquely hinting at her [...] "licentiousness". On 14 February, two new nude photographs surfaced [...] one featuring an unidentified woman fellating Chen, and another showed a woman lying on a bed.|$|E

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{reached the}} end of my tether, and when a third story was wanted I was {{compelled}} to seek new fields of adventure in the books of travellers. Regarding the Southern seas as the most romantic part of the world--after the backwoods!--I mentally and spiritually plunged into those warm waters, and the dive resulted in The Coral Island.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was; {{and then}} I {{followed}} the chase by mere nature and inclination. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> know <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{a right to}} follow it, because it gives me endurance, promptness, courage, self-control, as well as health and cheerfulness: and therefore--Ah! a fresh ostrich-track!' ...|$|R
60|$|Presently we rose, {{fearing that}} our limbs would stiffen if we stopped there longer, and {{commenced}} with slow and painful steps to struggle up the sloping {{sides of the}} great pit. For {{an hour or more}} we toiled steadfastly up the blue clay, dragging ourselves on by the help of the roots and grasses with which it was clothed. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no more thought of leaving the basket; indeed, nothing but death should have parted us.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going back}} some time, <b>but,</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> pulled out, I {{want to see}} all I can. I'd {{like to look at}} Europe, Egypt and India." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "As you please, brother. We {{are only}} too {{glad to have}} you home again, to care much about that. <b>But,</b> <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{something}} of importance to tell you about myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{a thrilling}} {{experience}} to me! Spectral as a vision though it seemed, and brief almost as the lightning flash, its visit {{was the real}} thing at last. Many a time <b>had</b> <b>I</b> heard and read of our lifeboats, and had seen them reposing in their boat-houses, as well as out [...] "for exercise," [...] <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen a lifeboat tearing before the gale through the tormented sea, sternly bent on the real work of saving human life.|$|R

60|$|We paced on steadily. I thought: “How {{on earth}} am I {{going to stop}} you?” Had this arisen only a month before, when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the means at hand and Dominic to confide in, <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> simply kidnapped the fellow. A little trip to sea {{would not have done}} Señor Ortega any harm; though no doubt it would have been {{abhorrent}} to his feelings. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not the means. I couldn’t even tell where my poor Dominic was hiding his diminished head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you {{remember}} in A Lawless Love, how often it's mentioned, and how glorious and golden it was? Well, I {{have never seen}} it till now, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If your Excellency will excuse me, I {{will come}} back in a moment; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a very {{important}} matter to attend to, and it must be attended to at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Dan, {{you go over}} to-night {{and find}} out all about it. I expect I had better have left things alone, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{interfered}} I shall go on with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The more I {{thought of}} Jackson's arm, the more shaken I was. I {{was confronted by}} the concrete. For the first time I was seeing life. My {{university}} life, and study and culture, had not been real. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> learned nothing but theories of life and society that looked all very well on the printed page, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen life itself. Jackson's arm was a fact of life. [...] "The fact, man, the irrefragable fact!" [...] of Ernest's was ringing in my consciousness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{had nothing}} to put to my mouth. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> met so kind a gentleman, I am sure that <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> a good supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come to me again, Stillwell, {{after you}} have spoken to the boys. <b>But,</b> <b>now</b> that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{suggested}} it, <b>I</b> am a little afraid. You know what cowboy fun is. Perhaps--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... [With vehement seriousness.] I {{may have}} {{acted like a}} cur. I don't know. I acted as I suppose every other man would. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a plain duty before me, and, by God, I mean to do it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not know}} what palaces were made for, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> found a use for them. The palaces of the Church should be {{hospitals}} and nurseries for those who have fallen by the wayside and are perishing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As for me, I {{think of}} nothing <b>but</b> {{politics}} <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> told you about my racing experiences. Just at present shooting is up. Before Christmas I shall go into Chiltern's country for a little hunting." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>now</b> that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> once started, <b>I</b> {{made up my}} mind not to be captured. I was a good block ahead, and by {{skillful}} turning I gradually {{managed to}} increase the distance.|$|R
6000|$|Thus he spoke, then ceased--for lo! {{something}} moved {{beneath the}} cloud of dust, something broke a way through the heap of the dead. Slowly it forced its path, pushing the slain this way and that, till at length it stood upon its feet and tottered towards us--a thing dreadful to look on. The shape was {{the shape of an}} aged woman, and even through the blood and mire I knew her. It was Nobela, she who had doomed me, she whom <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> smitten to earth, but who had come back from the dead to curse me! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am Tarzan," [...] {{replied the}} ape-man; [...] "mighty hunter, {{greatest}} of fighters. When I roar, the jungle is silent and trembles with terror. I am Tarzan of the Apes. I have been away; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{come back to}} my people." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have told}} you of a hero who fought with wild beasts and with wild men; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a tale of heroes who sailed away into a distant land, to win {{themselves}} renown for ever, in the adventure of the Golden Fleece.|$|E
