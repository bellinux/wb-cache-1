40|$|We {{report a}} new {{technique}} for measuring colouration efficiency (CE) for electrochromic polymers and devices. Faradaic charge associated with redox activity leading to chromic change was extracted from the total charge flow during a device switch. Typically, Faradaic charge is extracted from the total charge by first measuring a <b>blank</b> <b>device</b> (i. e. no polymer deposited). This is used as the baseline and subtracted from subsequent measurements with the polymer deposited into the device. The method is open to inaccuracies if the surface area before and after polymer deposition is different or if the inherent capacitance of the device is altered {{by the addition of}} the polymer(s). The new technique does not suffer from this drawback as it dispenses with the need to measure <b>blank</b> <b>devices.</b> To investigate the utility of this method a poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxthiophene) (PEDOT) and polyaniline (PANI) electrochromic cell was tested. CE measurements at an optical density change of 95 % (A = 555 nm) were recorded for the following three conditions: uncorrected, CEUC = 388 cm 2 /C; background corrected, CEBC = 391 cm 2 /C and; Faradaic corrected, CEFC = 2173 cm 2 /C.

Also, the previously programmed device can be erased and reprogrammed without removal from the circuit board. The proposal consists of an auxiliary microcontroller to program the application controller. The cost of the auxiliary controller is very cheap that the cost of the system doesn’t shoots up because of the auxiliary controller. One can log in to a host system from a terminal using rlogin and download a given hex file into the target system which is present in the remote pc. To upgrade the problems of the existing system, the proposal is to develop a programmer circuit at low cost to be incorporated with each and every board and also implementing a wireless transmitter and receiver between the personal computer and the target board such that the target microcontroller can be programmed even after installing the hardware in to its application.

40|$|Abstract The grapevine moth Lobesia botrana is a generalist insect {{herbivore}} and grapevine {{is one of}} its hosts. Previous {{studies have}} shown that insects use their olfactory abilities to locate hosts from a distance; whereas contact chemoreception mediates the stimulation of oviposition after landing. Little is known about the role of olfaction and its interactions with contact chemoreception and vision once the insect lands on the plant. Plant volatile compounds can be sensed by host-searching insects located some distance from the plant and insects sense both volatile and nonvolatile cues after landing on a plant. In the present study, we investigated the effects of these volatile and nonvolatile cues on the oviposition behavior of L. botrana. A behavioral bioassay with choice was developed in which insects were offered each sensory cue either alone or in combination with one or 2 other cues. Females were allowed to choose between a device with the stimulus and a <b>blank</b> <b>device.</b> Results were evaluated in terms of 2 parameters: quantity of eggs laid (egg counts) and preference for the stimulus (ODI: oviposition discrimination index). Our results suggest that olfaction significantly affects egg quantity and that there is significant synergism between olfaction and vision, in terms of their combined effect on egg quantity. In terms of preference (ODI), our results did not show a significant preference for any single cue; the highest ODI was measured for the full-cue stimulus (olfaction, vision, and contact). For ODI, a significant interaction was observed between olfaction and vision and a nearly significant interaction was observed between the olfactory and contact cues. The results are discussed in relation to the effects of plant sensory cues on the oviposition behavior of L. botrana...|$|R

40|$|A {{new process}} on {{friction}} aided deep drawing {{has been developed}} in which a metal blank-holder divided into eight fan-shaped segments is used instead of an elastomer ring used in the Maslennikov process. This <b>blank</b> holding <b>device</b> consists of four drawing segments and four small wedges, which can move radially in- and out-wards under a certain blank-holding pressure. The drawing process can be efficiently performed using an assistant punch, which partially supports the deformation of the blank as well as improving the shape, and dimensional accuracy of the drawn cup. Deep drawing experiments have been done using soft aluminum sheets of 0. 5 and 1. 0 mm in thickness to understand the main features of the proposed drawing process. Theoretical analyses based on the energy and slab methods have also been conducted to study the effect of main process parameters on the minimum blank holding pressure required for the onset of deformation, and to obtain the other optimum working conditions. The possibility of the new process has been confirmed by producing deep and successful cups with a drawing ratio of 4. 0, {{although the number of}} drawing operations is still high.

40|$|A new {{technique}} on friction aided deep drawing has been proposed. A metal blank holder {{was designed to}} be of two layers: stationary layer or base with four planes of 5 degrees taper angle and moving layer divided into four tapered segments. Under appropriate blank holding force, these four segments can move radially to the die opening with a constant speed by using a specially designed compression tool. The main function of this developed <b>blank</b> holding <b>device</b> is adopting the frictional force between the blank and the blank holder to work in the useful drawing direction likewise the function of the rubber ring used in Maslennikov's process. Drawing deformation is efficiently performed by using an assistant metal punch, which is supplemented with a hydraulic cylinder to provide a constant punch force during the drawing process. The drawing mechanism and the effects of drawing conditions are mainly investigated to characterize the merits and defects of the proposed process. Since successful deep cups of drawing ratio 3. 76 have been produced the possibility of the present technique is already confirmed, however, further investigations are needed to enhance the drawing efficiency.

40|$|Five {{studies were}} {{designed}} to characterize {{the effects of a}} non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, on ovarian function in cattle. The general hypothesis was that non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors have potential as a steroid-free option for the control of ovarian function for the purposes of fixed-time artificial insemination and embryo production. The specific objectives were to determine the effect of route and vehicle, type of aromatase inhibitor, and duration of aromatase inhibitor treatment (short vs prolonged) on ovarian follicles in cattle, and to test the efficacy of an aromatase inhibitor-based protocol to synchronize ovulation in cattle. In the first experiment, heifers were treated with letrozole intravenously (n= 10) or intramuscularly (n= 10) or allocated in iv and im control groups (n= 5 /group). During the second experiment, heifers were divided randomly into two groups (n= 15 /group) and an intravaginal device containing 1 g of letrozole or a <b>blank</b> <b>device</b> (control) was inserted. The third experiment was designed with the goal of formulating and testing an intravaginal device that provides biologically active circulating concentrations of an aromatase inhibitor for a minimum of 4 days. The biological significance of the pharmacokinetic differences between the letrozole intravaginal devices resulting from the third study was evaluated during the fourth study. A final study was designed to determine the effect of stage of the estrous cycle on the proportion of animals that ovulated and the synchrony of ovulation of heifers treated with an aromatase inhibitor-based ovulation-synchronization protocol and to determine subsequent pregnancy outcomes. In all the studies, the effects of aromatase inhibitor on ovarian function were assessed by transrectal ultrasound examination of the ovaries, and blood samples were collected for hormone concentration determination. Results demonstrated that route of administration, or more precisely, the nature of iii the vehicle used for the administration of letrozole (intravenous, intramuscular depot, short release intravaginal or prolonged release intravaginal) has an impact on the effects of letrozole on hormonal profiles and ovarian dynamics. The intramuscular route appeared to provide a prolonged release of letrozole from the injection site which had a marked effect on estradiol production, dominant follicle lifespan, and CL form and function. Letrozole treatment during the ovulatory follicle wave by means of a gel-based intravaginal releasing device during the second study resulted in more rapidly growing dominant follicles and larger ovulatory follicles, delayed ovulation (by 24 h) of a single follicle and formation of a CL that secreted higher levels of progesterone. A wax-based vehicle allowed for a steady and continuous delivery of the active compound over the treatment period. During the third study, the addition of a letrozole-containing gel coating increased the rate of initial absorption and hastened the increase on plasma concentrations of the active ingredient, while the letrozole-containing wax-based vehicle prolonged drug-delivery from the intravaginal device. When tested in vivo during the fourth study, we confirmed that letrozole-impregnated intravaginal devices formulated with a wax base plus a gel coat vehicle was most suitable for the application of a letrozole-based protocol for the synchronization of ovulation in cattle, since it effectively delivered elevated concentrations of letrozole, and reduced estradiol production resulting in increased follicular growth and lifespan, without adversely affecting progesterone production. The application of a letrozole-impregnated intravaginal device for 4 days, combined with PGF treatment at device removal and GnRH 24 h post-device removal increased the percentage of ovulations and synchrony of ovulation in cattle, regardless the stage of the estrous cycle at initiation of treatment. As observed in previous studies, the effects observed could be associated with an increase in circulating LH iv concentrations. However, the effects of treatment on gonadotropin concentrations are inconclusive, possibly due to inadequate sampling frequency. The impact of letrozole treatment of oocyte fertility remains unknown. The results of the five experiments support our general hypothesis that non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors have potential as a steroid-free option for the control of ovarian function in cattle. However, further research is needed in order to elucidate the effects of letrozole treatment during the proestrous on oocyte competence and fertility of the resulting ovulations in cattle...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, press {{hardening}} {{has become a}} fully established technology in both science and industry {{for the production of}} ultra-high-strength structural components, especially in the automotive industry. Beside the improvement of the car performance such as safety and lightweight design, the production process is also one focus of technology development trends in press hardening. Because of the additional process parameter of temperature, the energy and resource efficiency of such processes {{is one of the most}} important challenges. This includes alternative process steps and process chains as well as zero defect manufacturing by intelligent process control. Beside the high energy effort for heating up the blanks to austenitization temperature, the production floor space requirement is also comparably high, especially for heating devices. Due to the growing product variety in automobile production, combined with shorter product life cycles, the flexibility of production processes becomes more and more significant, which is also true for press hardening. This includes production organization as well as flexibility of production devices. Another topic is part complexity. A trend in automobile car body design is to reduce the number of parts by increasing the complexity – to combine an assembled component to a single part with locally varying properties. By using tailored tempering, the press hardening technology enables a selective approach of material strength in one single component. There are different solutions in production, but the technical effort to create components with tailored properties is relatively high. The article will give an overview about alternative approaches for optimized process chains of press hardening and also includes pre- and post-processing in addition to the actual forming and quenching process.
