40|$|The self {{seems to}} be a unitary entity {{remaining}} stable across time. Nevertheless, current theorizing conceptualizes the self as a number of interacting sub-systems involving perception, intention and action (self-model). One important function of such a self-model is to distinguish between events occurring as a result of one's own actions and events occurring as the result of somebody else's actions. We conducted an fMRI experiment that compared brain activation after an abrupt mismatch <b>between</b> <b>one's</b> own movement and its visual consequences with an abrupt mismatch <b>between</b> <b>one's</b> own movement and somebody else's visually perceived hand movement. A right fronto-parietal network was selectively active during a sudden mismatch <b>between</b> <b>one's</b> own observed and performed hand action...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the interrelationships between loneliness, college academic achievement, and locus of control. The sample consisted of 97 subjects who were randomly selected from those students living in the residence hall system at Oregon State University. Five null hypotheses were tested: 1. There is no relationship <b>between</b> <b>one's</b> degree of loneliness and academic achievement in college students. 2. There is no relationship <b>between</b> <b>one's</b> degree of loneliness and one's locus of control orientation in college students. 3. There is no relationship <b>between</b> <b>one's</b> locus of control orientation and academic achievement in college students. 4. There is no difference <b>between</b> <b>one's</b> degree of loneliness and one's academic year. 5. There is no difference <b>between</b> <b>one's</b> degree of loneliness and one's sex. The Bradley Loneliness scale and Levenson Control scale were administered by the author to each subject individually. A Pearson product-moment correlation and Partial correlation were employed to analyze the first three null hypotheses. The fourth hypothesis was analyzed by a fixed one-way analysis of variance, and the fifth hypothesis utilized a T-test to determine if a significant difference existed or not. The first null hypothesis was the only hypothesis which was rejected (r = -. 199, p =. 05), thereby confirming the relationship between loneliness and college academic achievement. Mo other statistically significant results were found. Suggestions for further experimentation in this area were made...|$|R
