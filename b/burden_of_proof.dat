5|$|According to the Court of Appeal, the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> of {{justifying}} the lawfulness of the appellants' detention was, {{in the first}} instance, on the detaining authority. This <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> could be discharged by evidence that the President, acting in accordance with advice of the Cabinet or an authorized minister, was satisfied that the detention was necessary for national security purposes, and by {{the production of the}} detention order. Once the detaining authority had discharged the initial <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof,</b> a <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> fell on the appellants to challenge their detention on GCHQ grounds.|$|E

In striking down New York's burden, the Court utilized the Mathews test to determine what <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> was due.|$|E

40|$|In jurisdictions that {{subscribe}} to adversarial mode <b>of</b> litigation, <b>burdens</b> and standards <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> have significant {{roles in the}} adjudication and determination of criminal cases. The operation {{of the principle of}} presumption of innocence in such jurisdictions determines issues of who bears what burden and the extent thereof. The Ethiopian criminal procedure system predominantly exhibits adversarial features, and there is the need for the comprehension and enforcement <b>of</b> the respective <b>burdens</b> and standards <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> borne by litigants. The constraints in clarity are more pronounced in those criminal law provisions that embrace some form of presumptions such as provisions on corruption offences. This note highlights how issues <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> and standard <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> are allocated as between prosecuting authorities and accused persons. Apart from explaining the nexus between the principle of presumption <b>of</b> innocence, <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> and standards <b>of</b> <b>proof,</b> it indicates the implications of the operation of the principle of presumption of innocence upon the allocation of evidential and persuasive <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> as {{between the state and the}} accused.

5|$|The U.S. KAL007 Victims' Association, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Hans Ephraimson-Abt, successfully lobbied U.S. Congress and the airline industry to accept an agreement that would ensure that future victims of airline incidents would be compensated quickly and fairly by increasing compensation and lowering the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> of airliner misconduct. This legislation has had far reaching effects for the victims of subsequent aircraft disasters.|$|E
5|$|The not-guilty verdict led to {{widespread}} dismay, and, as a result, the U.S. Congress {{and a number}} of states rewrote laws regarding the insanity defense.

Three states have abolished the defense altogether.|$|E
5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We shall {{argue that}} <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> are {{relevant}} also to monological reasoning, i. e., for deriving {{the conclusions of}} a knowledge-base allowing for con-flicting arguments. Reasoning with <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> can provide a useful extension of current argument-based non-monotonic logics, at least a different perspective on them. Firstly we shall provide an objective characterisation <b>of</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof,</b> as-suming that <b>burdens</b> concerns rule antecedents (literals {{in the body of}} rules), rather than agents. Secondly, we shall analyse the conditions for a burden to be satisfied, by considering credulous or skeptical derivability of the concerned antecedent or of its complement. Finally, we shall develop a method for developing inferences out of a knowledge base merging rules and proof burdens in the framework of defeasible logic...|$|R

5|$|Presumed Innocent premiered at the Fox Bruin Theater in Los Angeles, California on July 25, 1990, {{before being}} {{released}} in North America on July 27, 1990. The film has an approval rating of 86% at Rotten Tomatoes, with critics praising its directing, acting, and writing. It grossed $221 million worldwide, {{and became the}} eighth-highest-grossing film of 1990. The film {{was followed by a}} television miniseries titled The <b>Burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>Proof</b> in 1992 that takes place after the events of Presumed Innocent, and a television film sequel titled Innocent in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Presumed Innocent was {{followed}} by a two-part television miniseries, The <b>Burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>Proof</b> (1992). Based on Turow's 1990 novel, the miniseries focuses on defense attorney Sandy Stern (played by Héctor Elizondo), who investigates his wife's past following her apparent suicide. Presumed Innocent co-star Brian Dennehy appeared in a separate role as Stern's brother-in-law. Part one of the miniseries aired on the ABC network on February 9, 1992, with part two airing the following night on February 10.|$|E
40|$|A formal {{model is}} {{proposed}} <b>of</b> argumentation with <b>burdens</b> and standards <b>of</b> <b>proof,</b> overcoming shortcomings <b>of</b> earlier work. The model {{is based on}} a distinction between default and inverted <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof.</b> This distinction is formalised by adapting the definition of defeat of the ASPIC+ framework for structured argumentation. Since ASPIC+ generates abstract argumentation frameworks, the model is thus given a Dungean semantics.

5|$|Several legal {{developments}} {{occurred on}} the eve of the settlement. First, the First Circuit held in Bottomly v. Passamaquoddy Tribe (1979) that the Passamaquoddy were entitled to tribal sovereign immunity (see supra). Second, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court held in State v. Dana (1979) that the state had no jurisdiction to punish on-reservation arson because of the federal Major Crimes Act. Third, in Wilson v. Omaha Indian Tribe (1979), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the provision of the Nonintercourse Act placing the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> in land claims on non-Indians did not apply to U.S. state defendants (but did apply to corporate defendants); further, language in Wilson threatened to confine the applicability of the Act to Indian country. The tribes persuaded the U.S. Solicitor General to file a motion asking the Court to delete that language from its opinion. The Court denied the motion. Maine unsuccessfully sought certiorari in Dana on the basis of Wilson.|$|E
5|$|The federal jury convicted Cisneros of {{the murder}} on May 12 after three hours of deliberation. The {{prosecution}} introduced witnesses, including the motel manager and those at the crime scene, who stated that they saw a white car driven by the suspected assassins coming from Mexico {{the day before the}} shooting. The defense told the jurors that there was not enough evidence to uphold the conviction under federal requirements of reasonable doubt. The government concluded that it met the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> for interstate or foreign commerce charges in two ways: through Garza's phone calls from Mexico, and through the matching license plates of the Mexican car that crossed into the U.S. and registered at the motel, which matched the description of the vehicle seen at the murder scene. In order to find Cisneros guilty, they were not required to prove that she intended to use interstate or foreign commerce, or even that she knew it would be used. They were required to prove that someone involved in Fischer's murder used interstate or foreign commerce or caused another person to use it. On July 27, the jury rendered their final verdict and sentenced Cisneros to life in prison. Two years later, the United States Attorney Office recognized two local police officers and three FBI agents for assisting in her prosecution.|$|E
25|$|The {{party that}} does not carry the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> carries the benefit of {{assumption}} of being correct, they are presumed to be correct, until the burden shifts after presentation of evidence by the party bringing the action. An example is in an American criminal case, {{where there is a}} presumption of innocence by the defendant. Fulfilling the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> effectively captures the benefit of assumption, passing the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> off to another party.|$|E
50|$|Different {{types of}} {{proceedings}} require parties to meet different <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof,</b> the typical examples being {{beyond a reasonable}} doubt, clear and convincing evidence, and preponderance of the evidence.

25|$|Under normal {{long-term}} labour contracts, {{an employer}} bears the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> as the defendant; if the plaintiff is the fired employee, the employer must justify the firing.

25|$|In {{resource}} consent hearings the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> generally {{falls on}} the consent applicant to satisfy a hearing panel {{that the purpose of}} the Resource Management Act is met by granting rather than refusing consent.

A 'scintilla' of probative evidence may be enough to make an issue of a particular adverse effect 'live' and therefore requiring rebuttal if it is not to be found to be established.
