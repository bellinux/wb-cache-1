Wedge-type ultrathin Cu layers (0 - 0. 5 nm) are introduced between Pt/Co or Co/AlOx interfaces. Interface sensitive physical quantities such as the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) energy density, the interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (iPMA), and the magneto-optical Kerr effects (MOKE) are systematically measured {{as a function of}} Cu-insertion layer thickness.

However, stable bipolar resistive switching from amorphous TiO 2 thin films {{has only been}} achieved for Al metal electrodes that can have severe problems like electromigration and breakdown in real applications and can be a limiting factor for novel applications like transparent electronics. Here, amorphous TiO 2 -based {{resistive random access memory}} devices are presented that universally work for any configuration of metal electrodes via engineering the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>interface</b> domains. Both by inserting an ultrathin metal layer in the top interface region and by incorporating a thin blocking layer in the <b>bottom</b> <b>interface,</b> more enhanced resistance switching and superior endurance performance can be realized. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, point energy dispersive spectroscopy, and energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy, it is demonstrated that the stable bipolar resistive switching in metal/a-TiO 2 /metal RRAM devices is attributed to both interface domains: the top interface domain with mobile oxygen ions and the <b>bottom</b> <b>interface</b> domain for its protection against an electrical breakdown. Engineering of both interface domains in amorphous TiO 2 -based RRAM devices makes it possible that the devices are operated at any configuration of metal electrodes.

30|$|The work {{functions}} of top Ti and bottom Pt electrodes are 4.33 and 5.65  eV respectively [39]. Electron affinity and work function of ZnO (3.37  eV and 4.35  eV) {{are higher than}} those of CeO 2 (3.50  eV and 3.2  eV) [40]. So an energy barrier at the ZnO/CeO 2 −x interface is expected, like the Schottky barrier. In the positive voltage regime, electrons cannot be easily injected through the defects in CeO 2 by Pt bottom electrode to the ZnO layer because work function of ZnO is higher than CeO 2. That is why electrons are less capable of drifting from ZnO to Ti top electrode, as Ti is unable to attract oxygen ions from ZnO due to their similar work functions. The barrier height at the top Ti/ZnO and CeO 2 −x/Pt bottom interfaces is respectively 0.05  eV and 2.45  eV, barrier height at CeO 2 /Pt <b>bottom</b> <b>interface</b> is higher so electrons cannot be triggered easily from metal to dielectric, which results in the formation of a Schottky barrier at the <b>bottom</b> <b>interface</b> [41].|$|E
