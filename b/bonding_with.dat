5|$|Alice and the Redfields {{board the}} Arcadia, {{discovering}} it functional but abandoned. Claire then remembers Arcadia is an Umbrella trap to get test subjects; they release the survivors, among them K-Mart (Spencer Locke). Alice follows {{a trail of}} blood deeper into the ship, where she finds Wesker. The T-virus revived him, but it battles Wesker for control, something he believes fresh human DNA can pacify; the Umbrella staff fled when he began eating test subjects. Alice's DNA is superior to his, since she retained control despite her <b>bonding</b> <b>with</b> the virus at a cellular level; Wesker believes eating her will help him regain control of his body over {{the effects of the}} T-virus.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy was {{admitted}} to the Massachusetts Bar in 1959. In 1960, his brother John ran for President of the United States and Ted managed his campaign in the Western states. Ted learned to fly and during the Democratic primary campaign he barnstormed around the western states, meeting with delegates and <b>bonding</b> <b>with</b> them by trying his hand at ski jumping and bronc riding. The seven weeks he spent in Wisconsin helped his brother win the first contested primary of the season there and a similar time spent in Wyoming was rewarded when a unanimous vote from that state's delegates put his brother over the top at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.|$|E
30|$|The {{results are}} shown in Table  1. As with dry-bending strength, the wet-MOR of CA boards was {{lower than that of}} boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> PF and pMDI. However, the wet-MOE of boards was higher than those of boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> PF and pMDI. The wet-MOR value of the board under {{effective}} conditions satisfied the type 13 requirement of JIS A 5908 (> 6.5  MPa) [19]. SH of the board was lower than that of boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> PF and pMDI, probably because the CA made particles brittle [31]. Gambhir and Jamwal [32] reported that brittle particles absorbed very little energy. This means that boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA seemed to result in weak holding power for screws. The SH value of the board <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA satisfied type 8 standard of JIS A 5908 (> 300  N) [19]. As to the formaldehyde emission test, the board <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA did not emit formaldehyde, such as the boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> pMDI and PF. The formaldehyde emission value of the board <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA was lower than the F**** criteria of the lowest formaldehyde emission of JIS A 5908 standard [19]. Thus, boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA are environmentally friendly.|$|R

5|$|While H2 is {{not very}} {{reactive}} under standard conditions, it does form compounds with most elements. Hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more electronegative, such as halogens (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I), or oxygen; in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial positive charge. When bonded to fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen, hydrogen can participate in a form of medium-strength noncovalent <b>bonding</b> <b>with</b> the hydrogen of other similar molecules, a phenomenon called hydrogen bonding that {{is critical to the}} stability of many biological molecules. Hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements, such as metals and metalloids, where it takes on a partial negative charge. These compounds are often known as hydrides.|$|E
5|$|A three-part series {{published}} between November 1993 and January 1994, {{the series}} introduces attorney Beck as a love interest for Brock. When Beck pursues {{a lawsuit against}} Scarmore Industries for employees poisoned by a sentient liquid-mercury virus, Venom is injured trying {{to protect her from}} the Juggernaut's kidnap attempt. The symbiote is submerged and infected with the sentient virus (which heals Brock), <b>bonding</b> <b>with</b> the pair and introducing a third mind into their relationship. The virus drives Brock insane (causing him to murder a cleaning lady), and he is physically transported to the realm of insanity to confront its avatars: Paranoia, Dusk and the Necromancer. The symbiote overcomes the virus; Brock regains his senses, and Venom is returned to earth. Beck later insists on only being Brock's friend, because his romantic feelings for her make him more violent. Among DCD's 300 bestselling issues of 1993 Venom: The Madness #1 was number 173; the remaining issues did not chart.|$|E
5|$|Indium is a silvery-white, highly ductile post-transition metal with {{a bright}} luster. It is so soft (Mohs {{hardness}} 1.2) that like sodium, it can be cut with a knife. It also leaves a visible line on paper. It {{is a member of}} group 13 on the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between its vertical neighbours gallium and thallium. Like tin, a high-pitched cry is heard when indium is bent – a crackling sound due to crystal twinning. Like gallium, indium is able to wet glass. Like both, indium has a low melting point, 156.60°C (313.88°F); higher than its lighter homologue, gallium, but lower than its heavier homologue, thallium, and lower than tin. The boiling point is 2072°C (3762°F), higher than that of thallium, but lower than gallium, conversely to the general trend of melting points, but similarly to the trends down the other post-transition metal groups because of the weakness of the metallic <b>bonding</b> <b>with</b> few electrons delocalized.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the mean shear bond strength of molar tubes <b>with</b> micro-etched bases <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> either a compomer (Ultra Band-Lok), a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (3 M Multi-Cure or Fuji Ortho LC), or a light-cured resin adhesive (Transbond). The amount of adhesive remaining on the tooth surface following tube removal was assessed also. Finally, survival time of molar tubes <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> each <b>bonding</b> agent was assessed following simulated mechanical fatigue in a ball mill. A total of 120 extracted human third molars were collected and randomly divided into 4 test groups. Thirty teeth (20 to assess debonding force and 10 to assess survival time) were <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> each adhesive according to the manufacturers' instructions. Debonding was carried out using a Nene M 3000 testing machine with a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. The mean shear bond strength of tubes <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> Transbond was significantly {{less than that of}} those <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> 3 M Multi-Cure (P =. 0036) or Fuji Ortho LC (P <. 0001). Tubes <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> Ultra Band-Lok also had significantly lower mean shear bond strength than those <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> Fuji Ortho LC (P =. 020). Distribution of adhesive remnant index scores only differed significantly between tubes <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> 3 M Multi-Cure or Transbond. Only 1 molar tube, <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> Transbond, debonded in the ball mill at 5 hours, but at 50 hours {{there was no significant difference}} in the survival time of tubes <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> any of the bonding agents. Compomer or resin-modified glass ionomer cements appear to be viable alternatives to light-cured resin adhesive for bonding molar tubes...|$|R
30|$|The mass {{losses of}} {{specimens}} during the 12 -week fungal decay tests are also presented in Table  2. The mass losses of the boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA {{exposed to the}} brown-rot fungus were quite {{similar to those of}} boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> PF and pMDI. However, the mass losses of boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA and exposed to the white-rot fungus were higher than those of boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> PF. On the other hand, they were lower than those of the board <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> pMDI. In addition, the degree of mass losses of boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA was much lower than that of solid wood specimens (Cryptomeria japonica). In a previous study, Despot et al. [35] demonstrated that wood modified by CA had the greatest protection against decay. They also mentioned that the enhancement of decay resistance in wood modified by CA was exclusively the result of the cross-linking of CA and hydroxyl groups of the wood components. Therefore, the boards had good resistance against decay.|$|R

5|$|Pather Panchali was {{followed}} by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life—Aparajito (The Unvanquished) in 1956 and Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. Together, the three films constitute the Apu trilogy. Aparajito portrays the adolescent Apu, his education in a rural school and a Calcutta college. Its central theme is the poignant relationship between a doting mother and her ambitious young son. Apur Sansar depicts Apu's adult life, his reaction to his wife's premature death, and his final <b>bonding</b> <b>with</b> his son whom he abandoned as an infant. The sequels also won many national and international awards. Ray did not initially plan to make a trilogy: he {{decided to make the}} third film only after being asked {{about the possibility of a}} trilogy at the 1957 Venice Film Festival, where Aparajito won the Golden Lion. Apur Panchali (2014) is a Bengali film directed by Kaushik Ganguly, which depicts the real-life story of Subir Bannerjee, the actor who portrayed Apu in Pather Panchali.|$|E
5|$|Todd's {{identical}} twin brother, Victor Lord, Jr. (Trevor St. John), {{whom he had}} never known, is physically altered and brainwashed {{to believe that he}} is Todd. From May 2003 to August 2011, he assumes Todd's identity. In 2003, the presumed dead Irene Manning had ordered a hit on the real Todd to keep him from exposing her agency. She had Todd strapped to a chair and made him uncover every detail of his life. She originally gave Victor Todd's scar, but then had Victor's face altered with reconstructive surgery to make him look like Mitch Laurence's long lost brother, Flynn Walker Laurence. Irene sent Victor away in Todd's place, so that he could get his share of the inheritance as Victor Lord Sr.'s heir, and unknowingly help the agency. She kept the real Todd locked up, instead of following through with the original plan to kill him. She eventually admits to these facts after Todd escapes and returns home. Todd struggles with losing eight years of his life, and blames Victor for stealing his children, including the daughter he had with Téa, Danielle (Dani). He plans to kill Victor and is the top suspect when Victor is gunned down. He claims his innocence and convinces Starr to help him escape jail to keep Irene from killing the family for Victor's fortune. Although Irene wounds him, Todd kills her. Téa's brother, Tomás (Ted King), takes credit for allowing a wounded Todd to escape. Todd begins having vivid memories of killing Victor. Before Tomás is sentenced, Todd confesses to Irene's murder; Téa gets the charges reduced to self-defense. Todd locates the gun used to kill Victor and uses it to frame Tomás as revenge for initially bringing him to Irene. Todd and a rogue CIA agent force Tomás into a false confession. Todd faces difficulty <b>bonding</b> <b>with</b> Jack, who only accepts Victor as his father, but he continues to bond with Starr and assists her with various issues. He also helps Cole Thornhart fake his death so he can live with Starr and their daughter, Hope, in California. Todd is later arrested for Victor's murder.|$|E
