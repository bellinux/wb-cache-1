500|$|N. nigricollis is a {{moderately}} sized, venomous snake with {{a moderately}} distinct head; {{the shape of}} the head is due primarily to two large venom glands found {{on each side of the}} head. Its colour can vary depending on region of origin. Some specimens are black or pale grey with a yellow or reddish ventral side with a broad, black neck band, often with an orange or pinkish bar on the neck. Other specimens can be yellowish-brown or have a yellow copper colour and are missing the <b>bandings</b> around the neck and the reddish colour on the belly. Some other specimens are deep reddish-brown, and yet others are an olive brown. Some can even be striped black and white or totally white (with dark eyes). There are 21–23 dorsal scales at the mid-body, 182–196 ventral scales, and 54–66 subcaudal scales. This species generally grows to a length of [...] to [...] These sizes are subject to trends based on geographic location and subspecies.|$|E
500|$|The New Guinea {{crocodile}} {{grows to}} {{a length of}} up to [...] for males and [...] for females, although most specimens are smaller. The body ranges from grey to brown in colour, with darker <b>bandings</b> on the tail and body which become less noticeable as the animal grows. Longitudinal ridges {{in front of the}} eyes and some granular scales {{on the back of the}} neck between four large scales are distinctive features of this species. There are some differences between the northerly and southerly populations in the morphology of the skull and the arrangement of the scales. The snout is pointed and relatively narrow during juvenile stages and becomes wider as the animal matures. The New Guinea crocodile bears a physical similarity to the nearby Philippine crocodile (C. mindorensis) and Siamese crocodile (C. siamensis). The colouring is similar to that of the freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus johnsoni) of northern Australia, but the snout is somewhat shorter and broader.|$|E
40|$|Background Mechanical {{support of}} the failing right {{ventricle}} (RV) can be a life-saving option in patients with pulmonary hypertension. However, the RV is very afterload dependent and the pulmonary resistance {{is lower than the}} systemic resistance. Supporting a failing RV with a VAD can have unpredictable effects and is more likely to lead to RV dilatation. Therefore we wanted to assess the acute hemodynamic effects of right ventricular support in different conditions of RV-failure. Methods A CirculiteTM SynergyTM micro-pump was inserted in adult sheep via a left thoracotomy. Blood was withdrawn from the right atrium to the pulmonary artery (PA). Arterial blood pressure (ABP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), central venous pressure (CVP), heart rate (HR), pulmonary and pump flow were registered at baseline and at 22000 RPM. To mimic different types of RV failure, this procedure was performed in each animal 1) in control conditions (STANDARD), 2) after induction of pressure overload by banding the PA distal to the pump outflow tract (<b>BANDING)</b> and 3) after ligating the right coronary artery in these banded PA sheep (<b>BANDING</b> + LIGATION). Results Changes in hemodynamics (from 0 to 22000 RPM) in the 3 different experimental conditions are depicted in table 1. The CVP remained constant (both 12  1 mmHg in STANDARD, 13. 3  3. 1 vs 12. 7  2. 5 mmHg in <b>BANDING</b> and 14  3. 5 vs 14. 3  2. 3 mmHg in BANDING+LIGATION). Conclusions Right ventricular support in different types of RV-failure improves both systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics. The gain of systemic and pulmonary pressures is the highest in the pressure overloaded RV. An increased total cardiac output with stable CVP over the three hemodynamic conditions reflects the successful unloading of the RV and the good tolerance of this support. Table 1.

40|$|Summary. -Karyotyping and marker {{analysis}} of G- and C-banded metaphases from a metastatic bronchial carcinoma revealed a dominant stemline with five markers and four sidelines with additional markers. One to three minute bodies were {{noted in the}} majority of cells and these were classified as markers. On the basis of this analysis it was possible to postulate an evolutionary pathway within the tumour whereby the stemline was derived from existing sidelines. <b>BANDING</b> techniques for chromosome analysis may be expected to throw light on the complex patterns of change found in human cancer. So far, however, there have been very few detailed analyses of the chromosomes in solid malignant tumours.

5000|$|For levels 4 and 3, {{there are}} active {{retention}} criteria resulting in promotion and demotion each season. The primary method for ranking referees at levels 4 and 3 {{is through the}} use of club marks and assessor marks (minimum 5 matches), with referees ranked in both from A (best) to E (lowest). Referees who achieve [...] "AA" [...] are therefore considered the best by both assessors and clubs and are generally considered for promotion, likewise referees at [...] "EE" [...] are at risk or demotion. There are further criteria which include a referee who appears in the bottom levels of either club or assessor marks over two continuous seasons being considered for demotion, and referees are also judged on availability, fitness and administration (although these are not marked). Referees receive their <b>bandings</b> midway through the season so that they are aware of where they are, and the final <b>bandings</b> are collated {{at the end of the}} marking season (last day of February). Level 4 referees are exempt from demotion in their first season, except in exceptional circumstances (e.g. availability). Ultimately, the number of referees promoted and demoted between from level 4 and above depends on the number of retirements, vacancies and regional requirements.|$|E

50|$|Tunbridge ware {{is a form}} of decoratively inlaid woodwork, {{typically}} in the form of boxes, that is characteristic of Tonbridge and the spa town of Tunbridge Wells in Kent in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Shaped rods and slivers of wood were first carefully glued together, then cut into many thin slices of identical pictorial veneer with a fine saw. Elaborately striped and feathered <b>bandings</b> for framing were pre-formed in a similar fashion.|$|E

Nonetheless, Playmates released a number of action figures wearing these planned uniforms. Generations instead has the crew wearing both TNG and DS9/VOY uniforms, sometimes in the same scene (for instance, Worf and Riker in the battle against the Duras Sisters' Bird of Prey or Data and Geordi scanning the Amargosa Observatory for trilithium) as Jonathan Frakes and Levar Burton had to borrow Avery Brooks and Colm Meaney's costumes respectively since the time was so short.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional {{edge banding}} was a manual process {{requiring}} ordinary carpentry tools and materials. In modern applications, particularly for high-volume, repetitive manufacturing steps such as cabinet doors, edge banding {{is applied to}} the substrate by an automated process using a hot-melt adhesive. Hot melt adhesives can be water or solvent based and may consist of various raw materials including EVA, PUR, PA, APOA, and PO. A substrate primer may also be used as a bonding agent between the adhesive and the substrate. Thicker edge <b>bandings</b> typically require a slight concavity to provide a tight glue line. The thickness can vary from [...]018" [...] to 5mm or even more. The machine that applies the edge banding is called edgebander. An edgebander bonds the edge banding to the substrate, trims the leading and trailing edges, trims top and bottom flush with the substrate, scraps any surplus, and buffs the finished edge.|$|E
