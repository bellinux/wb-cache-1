40|$|Only the {{abstract}} {{is available for}} this technical report. Group communication is as an important functionality, which needs to be supported by various communication technologies. Applications of group communication include IP (or application-level) multicast, wireless and/or ad-hoc networks, <b>broadcast,</b> <b>conference</b> calling, pay-per-view, and even such seemingly unrelated to networks areas as copy protection. For many, if not all, of these applications, security and trust play an important role. Securing group communication typically requires confidentiality and authentication, which typically rely on secret keys. Thus key management issues must be addressed. This paper describes an implementation of one approach to dynamic group key management, {{which is based on}} Logical Key Hierarchy or Subset-Cover approach [1, 2]. Our approach achieves a dramatic reduction of the storage requirements for the Group Key Manager, and in particular allows all the secret key data to be stored on a smart-card. It also allows a number of subsequent improvements...|$|E

40|$|Arithmetic. (Under the {{guidance}} of Dr. Paul Franzon.) Floating Point Arithmetic is extensively used {{in the field of}} medical imaging, biometrics, motion capture and audio applications, including <b>broadcast,</b> <b>conferencing,</b> musical instruments and professional audio. Many of these applications need to solve sparse linear systems that use fair amounts of matrix multiplication. The objective of this thesis is to implement double precision floating point cores for addition and multiplication. These cores are targeted for Field Programmable Gate Arrays because FPGAs give the designer good control over the number of I/O pins and utilization of on chip memory. FPGAs are also comparable to floating point processors in their power consumption. The multiplier and adder cores conform to the IEEE 754 standard for double precision. The design is implemented on Xilinx ISE 8. 2 i and has been simulated on ModelSim 6. 1 i. The thesis pays significant attention to the analysis of the adder and multiplier cores in terms of pipelining and area so as to maximize throughput in any manner possible. It further throws light on variations of power with pipelining. Power measurements are done using XPower provided by ISE...|$|R
