5|$|Despite the {{publicity}} and billing {{this was only}} McKay's fifth prize-fight. Since his defeat {{at the hands of}} Byrne two-and-half years earlier McKay had fought and won just three matches, earning him £180, while Byrne had earned £200. <b>Both</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> promised £200 for the match whatever its outcome. McKay had earned £100 for his previous fight against Paul Spencer, the most he had ever received; the promised payment was a huge improvement in his fortunes.|$|E

5|$|The {{second part}} of the strategy, {{contrasting}} Aberhart's proposals with Douglas's, failed largely because <b>both</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> too evasive in their statements to make any kind of direct comparison of their views. Lakeland College historian Franklin Foster offers an additional explanation: when Albertans were exposed to the charismatic evangelist Aberhart and the dry technocrat Douglas, they preferred the former, irrespective of credentials or economic expertise.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials were}} fraught with irregularities. All three judges were pro-Goebel Democrats, {{and at one}} point the juror pool of 368 people was found to have only eight Republicans. Republican appeals courts {{overturned}} Powers' and Howard's convictions, though Powers was tried three more times, resulting in two convictions and a hung jury and Howard was tried and convicted twice more. <b>Both</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> pardoned in 1908 by Governor Augustus E.

Edited by publisher Max Amann, Hess and others, the work was published in two parts in 1925 and 1926. It was later released in a single volume, which became a best-seller after 1930. This book, with its message of violent antisemitism, became {{the foundation of the}} political platform of the NSDAP.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Machias men {{refitted}} {{and armed}} {{a variety of}} ships—including the Margaretta—and sailed off looking for battle with the British. The Machias Liberty and the Diligent were used to intercept merchant ships that were supplying the British in the Siege of Boston. Jeremiah O'Brien and John Lambert built a twenty-gun ship and began privateering under an American letter of marque. <b>Both</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> commissioned into the Continental Navy for their work.

5|$|Earthquake and Typhoon stopped teaming {{after their}} {{confrontation}} during the Royal Rumble match. No feud ever materialized, however, as Earthquake {{was released by}} the WWF and left to compete in Japan. The rivalry between Virgil and DiBiase was not mentioned again until the following year, when Virgil had a brief feud with Nikolai Volkoff, who was managed by DiBiase.

Morrow had been schooled in his party's {{principles}} by his father, Thomas Z. Morrow, who was its candidate for governor in 1883, and his uncle, William O. Bradley, who was elected governor in 1895. <b>Both</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> founding members of the Republican Party in Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, it {{was decided}} that the battalion's key positions, {{including}} its officers, non commissioned officers (NCOs) and signallers, would initially be filled largely by New Zealanders of European descent. This decision was met with some consternation, so assurances were made that over time suitable Māori candidates would take over these positions. In this regard, {{it was decided}} that the battalion's first commanding officer would be a regular officer, Major George Dittmer—later promoted to lieutenant colonel in January 1940—and that his second-in-command would be a Reserve officer, Lieutenant Colonel George Bertrand, a part-Māori who would take up the position with the rank of major. <b>Both</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> veterans of the First World War and had considerable experience.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, {{a passing}} {{motorist}} spotted the fugitives by Interstate 80 and called police. The men fled when authorities {{arrived at the}} scene shortly after, but Bostic was tackled by a state trooper shortly after 6 p.m., while Ellis managed to escape. At 8 a.m. the next morning, Ellis was cornered near I-80 by two police dogs. <b>Both</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> extradited to New York from Pennsylvania on July 12.

5|$|Pompey and Crassus reaped {{political}} {{benefit for}} having {{put down the}} rebellion. Both Crassus and Pompey returned to Rome with their legions and refused to disband them, instead encamping outside Rome. Both men stood for the consulship of 70 BC, even though Pompey was ineligible because of his youth and lack of service as praetor or quaestor. Nonetheless, <b>both</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> elected consul for 70 BC, {{partly due to the}} implied threat of their armed legions encamped outside the city.|$|E

5|$|Unknown to Karman, <b>both</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> PKI {{members and}} intent on making him join the party. They gave him {{communist}} pamphlets and indoctrinated him in Party philosophy. When Karman {{was late in}} telling Rifah his feelings, losing her to another man, the PKI manipulated his emotions to make him leave Islam and hate Haji Bakir. Ultimately this was successful: Karman abandoned his mandatory prayers and began to espouse the Party's politics. After Karman was refused marriage to Rifah a second time, following her husband's death, he had Haji Bakir imprisoned. In this time Karman married Marni, intending to convert her family to communism.|$|E

5|$|After Extreme Rules, Orton began pairing with Daniel Bryan {{despite their}} poor {{relationship}} {{to face a}} common enemy in the Shield. On the June 14 SmackDown, Orton teamed with Bryan and Kane to end the Shield's unpinned and unsubmitted streak in televised six-man tag matches.
