40|$|The paper {{presents}} an efficient numerical {{model for the}} inelastic response analysis of R/C panels under cyclic excitations. A plane stress 2 d membrane model has been developed that accounts for the concrete and reinforcing steel interaction. The reinforcing bars are modeled as multiple smeared steel layers with an uniaxial stress-strain relation in the bar direction following the Menegotto-Pinto constitutive model with isotropic hardening. The concrete material model is based on damage mechanics with an efficient two parameter damage law. At {{this stage of the}} research the bond-slip between concrete and rebars is not taken into account. The new model is validated by comparison with several experimental results on reinforced concrete panels from the literature. The tests are carried out under quasi-static conditions. The accuracy of the model in reproducing the cyclic behavior of reinforced concrete panels with different reinforcement ratio and <b>bar</b> <b>inclination</b> is excellent...|$|R
40|$|This {{pilot study}} {{examines}} {{the most relevant}} kinetic and kinematics variables in two bench press exercises; Smith Machine (PMS) vs. free weights (PBL). Two trained subjects participated in the research following informed consent. To determine the maximum load (1 -RM), two incremental protocols were used for PMS and PBL. Subject 1 (S- 1) produced force values of 770 N and 837 N, peak force of 28 ms and 12 ms, in PBL and PMS respectively. Values for subject 2 (S- 2) were 693 N and 849 N, PMF of 60 ms and 66 ms for PBL and PMS respectively. Detailed analyses of the following variables were performed; velocity curves for each load, the “sticking period”, the distances of grip width, and changes in <b>bar</b> <b>inclination</b> during the ascent phase of the lift were examined. The key findings of this research, and the basis for future research demonstrate that PBL is recommended as a training exercise, while more reliable information regarding force variables can be attained through using PMS in measurement sessions.

40|$|We {{address the}} issue of {{accuracy}} in recovering density profiles from observations of rotation curves of galaxies. We “observe ” and analyze our models {{in much the same way}} as observers do the real galaxies. Our models include stellar disks, disks with bars, and small bulges. We find that the tilted ring model analysis produces an underestimate of the central rotational velocity. In some cases the galaxy halo density profile seems to have a flat core, while in reality it does not. We identify three effects, which explain the systematic biases: (1) inclination (2), small bulge, and (3) <b>bar.</b> <b>Inclination</b> effects are due to finite thickness of disk, bar, or bulge. Admixture of a non-rotating bulge component reduces the rotation velocity. A small (200 - 500 pc) bulge may be overlooked leading to systematic bias even on relatively large ∼ 1 kpc distances. In the case of a disk with a bar, the underestimate of the circular velocity is larger due to a combination of non-circular motions and random velocities. The effect of the bar depends on the angle that the bar makes with the line of sight. Signatures of bars can be difficult to detect in the surface brightness profiles of the model galaxies. The variation of inclination angle and isophote position angle with radius are more reliable indicators of bar presence than the surface brightness profiles...|$|R

The numerical results are compared with experimental data. In-terestingly, the two-dimensional two-uid model performed well, using simple constitutive relations being functions of the local ow conditions. In the present work, a two-uid model has been imple-mented {{in the framework of}} a two-dimensional multiphase Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code. The govern-ing equations were spatially discretized using the nite-volume technique, and the time-integrator was an explicit low-storage ve-step fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme. Numerical results from the present program, the OLGAS simulator, the Beggs and Brill correlation, and the Friedel and the Premoli correlations have been compared to 52 data points from the TILDA two-phase pipe ow database at the SINTEF multiphase ow laboratory.

40|$|We use the VVV survey {{observations}} in bulge regions {{close to the}} Galactic plane to trace the <b>bar</b> <b>inclination</b> at the Galactic latitude b∼± 1 and to investigate a distinct structure in the inner regions of the bar that was previously detected at positive latitude (b=+ 1). We use the (J-Ks) colors of the red clump stars to obtain reddening values on 6 x 6 arcmin scale, minimizing the problems arising from differential extinction. Dereddened magnitudes are then used to build the luminosity function of the bulge in regions of 0. 4 sq deg to obtain the mean red clump magnitudes. These are used as distance indicators to trace the bar structure. The luminosity function clearly shows the red clump mean magnitude variation with longitude, as expected from a large scale bar oriented towards us at positive Galactic longitude, with a dereddened magnitude varying from Ks_ 0 = 13. 4 at l=- 10 to Ks_ 0 = 12. 4 at l=+ 10. We detect {{a change in the}} orientation of the bar in the central regions with |l|< 4 at b=± 1, in agreement with results obtained at positive latitudes by other authors. Our results are based on a different dataset and at different latitude, which shows that this change in the bar orientation is real. This suggests that there is an inner structure distinct to the large-scale Galactic bar, with a different orientation angle. This inner structure could be a secondary, inner bar, with a semi-major axis of 500 pc that is symmetric with respect to the Galactic plane. Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A Letter...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a study of galactic disks {{rotating}} in cosmologically motivated cuspy dark matter halos. The model galaxies include stellar disks, disks with bars, and disks with bulges. The main question, which we try to address is how accurately rotation curves and density profiles are recovered in real observations of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies. For this, we closely mimic observational procedures. We “observe ” the disk using the methods that observers apply to real data. We find that the tilted ring model analysis produces an underestimate of the central rotational velocity. In some cases the galaxy halo density profile seems to have a flat core, while in reality it does not. We identify three effects, which explain the systematic biases: (1) inclination (2), small bulge, and (3) <b>bar.</b> <b>Inclination</b> effects are due to finite thickness of disk, bar, or bulge. Admixture of a non-rotating bulge component reduces the rotation velocity. A small (200 - 500 pc) bulge may be overlooked leading to systematic bias even on relatively large ∼ 1 kpc distances.

The effect of the bar depends on the angle that the bar makes with the line of sight. Signatures of bars can be difficult to detect in the surface brightness profiles of the model galaxies. The variation of inclination angle and isophote position angle with radius are more reliable indicators of bar presence than the surface brightness profiles. The systematical biases in {{the central part of the}} rotation curve result in an underestimation of the density of the central part of the disk. In some cases this results in the false inference that the density profile of the halo flattens in the central parts...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of spiral and <b>bar</b> galaxy <b>inclination</b> an- gles {{is expected to}} be uniform. However, analysis of sev- eral major galaxy catalogs shows this is not the case; galaxies oriented near edge-on are significantly more common in these catalogs. In an attempt to explain this discrepancy, we have developed a galaxy simulation code to compute the appearance of a spiral type galaxy as a function of its morphological parameters. We examine the dependence of observed brightness upon inclination angle by using smooth luminous mass density and in- terstellar medium (ISM) density distributions. The lu- minous mass component is integrated along a particular line of sight, thus producing a mass distribution, from which a surface luminosity profile is derived. The ISM component is integrated alongside the luminous mass component to account for light extinction. If the de- pendence of the total surface brightness on inclination strongly corresponds to the observed {{distribution of}} incli- nation angles, we can attribute much of the discrepancy to a geometrical selection effect...|$|R

We searched for spiral arms through Fourier analysis of the spatial distribution of three tracers (non-circular motion, enhancement of the oxygen abundance, and of the extinction) in the discs of our target galaxies. The spiral arms (two-armed logarithmic spirals in the deprojected map) are shown in each target galaxy for each tracer considered. The pitch angles of the spiral arms in a given galaxy obtained with the three different tracers are close to each other. The enhancement of the oxygen abundance in the spiral arms as compared to the abundance in the interarm regions at a given galactocentric distance is small; within a few per cent. We identified a metallicity gradient in our target galaxies. Both barred galaxies in our sample show flatter gradients than the two galaxies without <b>bars.</b> Galactic <b>inclination,</b> position angle of the major axis, and the rotation curve were also obtained for each target galaxy using the Fourier analysis of the two-dimensional velocity map.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the accuracy {{in the recovery}} of the stellar dynamics of barred galaxies when using axisymmetric dynamical models. We do this by trying to recover the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxy simulations using the Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion (JAM) method. However, given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of an axisymmetric modeling algorithm to a non-axisymmetric system and in particular to inaccuracies in the de-projected mass model, our results are relevant for general axisymmetric modelling methods. We run N-body collisionless simulations to build a library with various luminosity distribution, constructed to mimic real individual galaxies, with realistic anisotropy. The final result of our evolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies. The JAM method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution, and we adopt a spatially constant M/L and anisotropy beta_z= 1 -sigma_z^ 2 /sigma_R^ 2 distributions. The models are fitted to two-dimensional maps of the second velocity moments V_rms=sqrt(V^ 2 +sigma^ 2) of the simulations for various viewing angles (position angle of the <b>bar</b> and <b>inclination</b> of the galaxy). We find that the inclination is generally well recovered by the JAM models, for both barred and unbarred simulations. For unbarred simulations the M/L is also accurately recovered, with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just Delta(M/L) < 1. 5 % when the galaxy is not too close to face on. At very low inclinations (i< 30 deg) the M/L can be significantly overestimated (9 % in our tests, but errors can be larger for very face-on views). For barred simulations the M/L is on average (when PA= 45 deg) essentially unbiased, but we measure an over/under estimation of up to Delta(M/L) = 15 % in our tests. The sign of the M/L bias depends on the position angle of the bar as expected. [Abridged]Comment: 29 pages, 29 figures, LaTeX. Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

The final {{goal is to}} obtain the mass distribution of a sample of isolated spiral galaxies in order to model their gas kinematics. This is then compared to the observed rotation curve, to determine {{the necessity of a}} dark halo in the inner parts (Perez et al. 2004, A&A, 424, 799). The azimuthally averaged radial surface brightness profiles and the integrated magnitudes obtained from ellipse fitting are given for each of the sample galaxies. The ellipse fitting technique applied to the light distribution also allowed us to obtain the size of the <b>bar,</b> and the <b>inclination</b> and position angle of the outer isophotes that allow the galaxy deprojection. Using these profiles, 1 -D disk-bulge decomposition was performed to obtain the disk scale-length and the bulge effiective radius for the different bands. Through the fitting of a parametric function to the observed rotation curve, the maximum rotational velocity and the corresponding radius was obtained. The correlation between the bulge and disk parameters is in agreement with previous studies (de Jong 1996 a, A&A, 313, 45; Marquez & Moles 1999, A&A, 344, 421; Baggett et al. 1998, AJ, 116, 1626). Regarding the Kormendy relation (Kormendy 1977, ApJ, 218, 333), in agreement with de Jong, no correlation between the bulge effective radius and its surface brightness is found, possibly due to the small range of bulge magnitudes covered.

40|$|We {{study the}} colors and orientations of {{structures}} in low and intermediate <b>inclination</b> <b>barred</b> galaxies. We test the hypothesis that barlenses, roundish central components embedded in bars, could form {{a part of the}} bar in a similar manner to boxy/peanut bulges in the edge-on view. A sample of 79 barlens galaxies was selected from the S$^ 4 $G and the NIRS 0 S surveys. The sizes, ellipticities, and orientations of barlenses were measured and used to define the barlens regions in the color measurements. The orientations of barlenses were studied with respect to those of the "thin bars" and the line-of-nodes of the disks. For 47 galaxies color maps were constructed using the SDSS images in five optical bands, u, g, r, i, and z. Colors of bars, barlenses, disks, and central regions of the galaxies were measured using two different approaches and color-color diagrams sensitive to metallicity, stellar surface gravity, and short lived stars were constructed. Color differences between the structure components were calculated for each individual galaxy, and presented in histogram form. We find that the colors of barlenses are very {{similar to those of the}} surrounding bars, indicating that most probably they form part of the bar. We also find that barlenses have orientations closer to the disk line-of-nodes than to the thin bars, which is consistent with the idea that they are vertically thick, in a similar manner as the boxy/peanut structures in more inclined galaxies. Typically, the colors of barlenses are similar to those of normal E/S 0 galaxies. Galaxy by galaxy studies show that in spiral galaxies very dusty barlenses also exist, along with barlenses with rejuvenated stellar populations. The central regions of galaxies are found to be on average redder than bars or barlenses, although galaxies with bluer central peaks also exist. Comment: 24 pages, 10 figures, 3 appendices.
