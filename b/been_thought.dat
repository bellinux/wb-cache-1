5|$|A feigned retreat by the Picts {{drew the}} Northumbrians into an ambush at Dun Nechtain near the lake of Linn Garan. The battle site has long <b>been</b> <b>thought</b> {{to have been}} near the present-day village of Dunnichen in Angus. Recent research, however, has {{suggested}} a more northerly location near Dunachton, {{on the shores of}} Loch Insh in Badenoch and Strathspey.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{was born}} in Hazaribagh, India, to Arthur Herbert Collins, a judge in the Indian Civil Service, and Mrs Esther Ida Collins. It had <b>been</b> <b>thought</b> that both of his parents had died {{by the time he}} began his {{education}} at Clifton College, Bristol, where he held a scholarship. However, the 1901 census shows that Arthur's mother was actually still alive.|$|E

50|$|To {{the extent}} that melanotan II {{produces}} melanogenesis, this <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to <b>be</b> caused by activation of the MC1 receptor, whereas its possible sexual effects <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to <b>be</b> related to its ability to activate the MC4 receptor (though the MC3 <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to possibly also be involved).|$|R
5|$|Snakes {{have been}} {{part and parcel of}} culture and religion. Vivid scale {{patterns}} have <b>been</b> <b>thought</b> to have influenced early art. The use of snake-skin in manufacture of purses, apparel and other articles led to large-scale killing of snakes, giving rise to advocacy for use of artificial snake-skin. Snake scales are also to be found as motifs in fiction, art and films.|$|E
5|$|The Severn Estuary, which empties {{into the}} Bristol Channel, has {{traditionally}} <b>been</b> <b>thought</b> {{to have the}} second largest tidal range in the world– about , exceeded only by the Bay of Fundy in Canada. Some controversy exists {{as to whether the}} tidal range in Ungava Bay, also in Canada, is greater than the Bay of Fundy, relegating the Severn Estuary to third place.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} off Trondheim, Admiral Hipper successfully passed {{herself off}} as a British warship long enough to steam past the Norwegian coastal artillery batteries. The ship entered the harbor and docked shortly before 05:30 to debark the mountain troops. After the ground troops seized control of the coastal batteries, the ship left Trondheim, bound for Germany. She was escorted by Friedrich Eckoldt; she reached Wilhelmshaven on 12 April, and went into drydock. The dockyard workers discovered the ship had been damaged more severely by the collision with Glowworm than had previously <b>been</b> <b>thought.</b> Nevertheless, repairs were completed {{in the span of}} two weeks.|$|E

5|$|Against Neaera is {{preserved}} as Demosthenes' fifty-ninth speech, {{though it has}} <b>been</b> <b>thought</b> inauthentic since antiquity. Dionysius of Hallicarnassus, for instance, questioned its authorship. Modern scholars from the nineteenth century to the present have generally accepted that the speech was not written by Demosthenes, and today it is often grouped {{with the rest of}} the speeches concerning Apollodoros as being the work of a single Pseudo-Demosthenes. This author has been identified as Apollodoros himself by various scholars, including Kapparis in his commentary on the speech.|$|E
5|$|An elf (plural: elves) {{is a type}} of human-shaped supernatural {{being in}} Germanic mythology and folklore. In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves seem {{generally}} to have <b>been</b> <b>thought</b> of as beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them. However, the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space, and have flourished in both pre-Christian and Christian cultures.|$|E
5|$|At {{the bottom}} of the hill beside the battery are two {{rectangular}} earthworks, 16 metres by 8 metres (52ft and 26ft), and 26 metres and 12 metres (85ft and 39ft). Traditionally these have <b>been</b> <b>thought</b> to be Royalist gun batteries pre-dating the construction of Oliver's Battery, but recent scholarship casts doubt on this, suggesting that they are instead the remains of hollow ways and sand pits.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} <b>been</b> <b>thought</b> of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
5|$|During {{the return}} from the Galápagos through the Sargasso Sea, Beebe once again failed to find the thick mats of Sargassum whose study {{had been one of}} the primary goals of the expedition. Searching for a way to satisfy his expedition's donors, Beebe hit upon the idea of documenting the marine life of the Hudson Gorge just beyond the shore of New York City. Applying the same {{techniques}} to studying the Hudson Gorge that he had used in the Galápagos, Beebe encountered a surprising variety of sea animals, many of which had previously <b>been</b> <b>thought</b> to be exclusive to the tropics.|$|E
5|$|Habitat loss has {{occurred}} through commercial harvesting of the sago, or conversion to rice cultivation and fishponds. The rail is a prized food for local people who catch it with traps made from strings of bark and hunt it with dogs. The only described nest {{was in an}} area well-used by local villagers, and the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had <b>been</b> <b>thought.</b> There were also several sightings in northeast Halmahera in 2008 and 2011, extending {{the area in which}} this bird has been seen in recent years.|$|E

5|$|In 1885, a nova-like {{outburst}} {{was observed}} {{in the direction of}} the Andromeda galaxy by Ernst Hartwig in Estonia. S Andromedae increased to 6th magnitude, outshining the entire nucleus of the galaxy, then faded in a manner much like a nova. In 1917, George W. Ritchey measured the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy and discovered it lay much farther than had previously <b>been</b> <b>thought.</b> This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a much greater amount of energy than was typical for a nova.|$|E
5|$|In the {{election}} of 1796, under the Constitution as it stood then, each of the presidential electors had two votes, which they were to cast for different men. The one who received most votes would become President, the second-most, Vice President. This system was not designed with the operation of parties in mind, as they had <b>been</b> <b>thought</b> disreputable and factious. The Federalists planned {{to deal with this}} by having all their Electors vote for John Adams, the Vice President, and all but a few for Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Research, in 2008, by {{scientists}} from Pennsylvania State University found {{high levels of}} the pesticides fluvalinate and coumaphos in samples of wax from hives, as well as lower levels of 70 other pesticides. These chemicals {{have been used to}} try to eradicate varroa mites, a bee pest that itself has <b>been</b> <b>thought</b> to be a cause of CCD. Researchers from Washington State University, under entomology professor Steve Sheppard in 2009, confirmed high levels of pesticide residue in hive wax and found an association between it and significantly reduced bee longevity.|$|E

5|$|Spectroscopic {{observations}} in the 1900s gave the first {{clues about the}} Venusian rotation. Vesto Slipher tried to measure the Doppler shift of light from Venus, but found he could not detect any rotation. He surmised the planet must have a much longer rotation period than had previously <b>been</b> <b>thought.</b> Later work in the 1950s showed the rotation was retrograde. Radar observations of Venus were first {{carried out in the}} 1960s, and provided the first measurements of the rotation period, which were close to the modern value.|$|E
5|$|The German {{breakthrough}} at Sedan, {{which had}} <b>been</b> <b>thought</b> impassable, meant that {{defenders of the}} K-W Line risked being outflanked, and had to withdraw on 16 May. The German invasion triggered a panic amongst Belgian civilians {{in the path of}} the advancing German army. By 11 May, the roads leading westwards, away from the fighting, were blocked by refugees, hampering the eastward advance of French and British forces. It is estimated that around two million civilians fled their homes during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of chemical defences in plants {{is linked to}} the emergence of chemical substances that are not involved in the essential photosynthetic and metabolic activities. These substances, secondary metabolites, are organic compounds that are not directly involved in the normal growth, development or reproduction of organisms, and often produced as by-products during the synthesis of primary metabolic products. Although these secondary metabolites have <b>been</b> <b>thought</b> {{to play a major role}} in defenses against herbivores, a meta-analysis of recent relevant studies has suggested that they have either a more minimal (when compared to other non-secondary metabolites, such as primary chemistry and physiology) or more complex involvement in defense.|$|E
