50|$|It likely {{spent most}} of its life in trees, and was {{probably}} a <b>brachiator,</b> similar to modern orangutans and gibbons. Its molars had relatively little enamel, suggesting that it ate soft leaves and fruit, an ideal diet for a tree-dwelling animal.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{traits that}} allow {{primates}} to brachiate include a short spine (particularity the lumbar spine), short fingernails (instead of claws), long curved fingers, reduced thumbs, long forelimbs and freely rotating wrists. Modern humans retain many physical characteristics that suggest a <b>brachiator</b> ancestor, including flexible shoulder joints and fingers well-suited for grasping. In lesser apes, these characteristics were adaptations for brachiation. Although great apes do not normally brachiate (with {{the exception of}} orangutans), our human anatomy suggests that brachiation may be an exaptation to bipedalism, and healthy modern humans are still capable of brachiating. [...] Some children's parks include monkey bars which children play on by brachiating.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{the emergence of}} periodic motion as consequence of evolutionary pressure for energy-efficient partially-passive dynamic brachiation. Brachiation was simulated for gibbon-like creatures in a realistic physics environment. The morphologies of the brachiators were identical {{to each other and}} consisted of a simple 3 -bodied system- two arms and a torso. <b>Brachiator</b> performance was controlled by their genome, which contained their initial position at t= 0 and torque functions which were applied to the shoulder for t> 0. Performance for each <b>brachiator</b> was measured by total distance traveled and energy-efficiency of locomotion. Brachiators found in the first two Pareto-optimum curves were selected for reproduction. It was found that energy-efficient long-range motion resulted in periodic motion in the brachiators. ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Brachiators</b> are {{a type of}} primate {{mostly from}} the family Hylobatidae, which {{includes}} gibbons. <b>Brachiators</b> use their arms to move from tree branch to tree branch, through a process called brachiation. Their arms are longer than their legs, and are much more powerful.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Brachiators</b> {{began as}} four-footed monkey-like creatures in the Tertiary Era in Africa and Northern Europe. Eventually, {{some of the}} monkeys began to use their arms to swing, and lost their tails, due to evolution. Without a tail, they ceased to be monkeys, and became apes with strong arms. Through the ages, the ape-like {{ancestors}} developed stronger arms and the shoulder blades moved {{from the side of}} their chests to the back of their bodies.|$|R
40|$|Simple walking models, {{like the}} compass-gait model, have yielded useful {{insight into the}} basic {{mechanics}} of walking. A similar model serves as a template for brachiation. With {{the ability of a}} two-link robot to walk and swing, we explore the multi-locomotion capability of a generalized two-link model with potential footholds at any location. We focus on the connected components of passive gaits in a five-dimensional state-time space. Our main results are: (1) a walking gait and a brachiating gait cannot be in the same connected component and (2) the stability of a gait depends on whether impacts are state-based (e. g., footfall in a biped walker) or time-based (e. g., time between clamping <b>brachiator</b> hands to a wall). For the same connected component of gaits, the different impact types result in different bifurcations...|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} brachaiators were smaller than average apes, so {{were able to}} move through the trees easier than gorillas or orangutans, {{although}} female orangutans do brachiate through the trees occasionally. The <b>brachiators</b> held their bodies upright in the trees, and would sometimes go on the ground and walk upright. This helped them survive in the plains when the forests began to die, because they were so unfamiliar to the predators {{that they would not be}} attacked.|$|R
50|$|Brachiation is a {{specialized}} form of arboreal locomotion, used by primates to move very rapidly while hanging beneath branches. Arguably {{the epitome of}} arboreal locomotion, it involves swinging with the arms from one handhold to another. Only a few species are <b>brachiators,</b> {{and all of these}} are primates; it is a major means of locomotion among spider monkeys and gibbons, and is occasionally used by female orangutans. Gibbons are the experts of this mode of locomotion, swinging from branch to branch distances of up to 15 m (50 ft), and traveling at speeds of as much as 56 km/h (35 mph).|$|R
40|$|The {{swinging}} motion {{seen when}} <b>brachiators</b> move beneath their overhead supports naturally {{brings to mind}} the oscillations of a pendulum and the repeated interchange of gravitational potential energy (Ep) with kinetic energy (Ek). It is tempting, then, to assume that brachiating apes use natural pendular motions to reduce the muscular investment necessary to travel within the forest canopy (Ashton and Oxnard, 1964 a,b; Fleagle, 1974; Preuschoft and Demes, 1984). Previous pendular swinging models are all based explicitly or implicitly on a half cycle of a freely swinging pendulum. Under some circumstances, <b>brachiators</b> do move roughly according to the predictions of simple oscillatory pendular motion. Preuschoft and Demes (1984) modeled brachiation as a distributed-mass simple pendulum. They found good agreement with observed brachiation in gibbons for relatively slow brachiation. They predicted a natural pendular period of 0. 98 s, while empirically measured periods in similar sized gibbons ranged from 0. 83 to 0. 95 s for slow, continuous-contact brachiation. Some limitations in the pendular swinging models have been attributed to model oversimplification with regard to both poor representation of the complex mass distribution of the animal and potential movements of non-support limbs during the swing (Fleagle, 1974; Preuschoft and Demes, 1984). Swartz (1989) pointed to the narrow range in oscillation frequency that pendular swinging models allow. Preuschoft and Demes (1984) recognized many of the features affecting ricochetal brachiation (see their Fig. 12. 5), but the pendular model they presented did not calculate an...|$|R
40|$|This conference paper {{serves to}} examine the {{evolutionary}} linkages of a brachiating ancestor in humans, the biomechanical and neurophysiology of modern day <b>brachiators,</b> and the human rediscovery of this form of locomotion. Brachiation is arguably {{one of the most}} metabolically effective modes of travel by any organism and can be observed most meritoriously in Gibbons. The purpose of the research conducted for this paper was to encourage further exploration of the neurophysiological similarities and differences between humans and non-human primates. The hope is that in spurring more interest and research in this area, further possibilities for rehabilitating brain injury will be developed, or even theories on how to better train our athletes, using the biomechanics and neurophysiology of brachiation as a guide...|$|R
5000|$|The fur {{coloring}} of the {{lar gibbon}} varies from black and dark-brown to light-brown, sandy colors. The {{hands and feet}} are white-colored, likewise a ring of white hair surrounds the black face. Both males and females can be all color variants, and the sexes also hardly differ in size. Gibbons are true <b>brachiators,</b> propelling themselves through the forest by swinging under the branches using their arms. Reflecting this mode of locomotion, the white-handed gibbon has curved fingers, elongated hands, extremely long arms and relatively short legs, giving it an intermembral index of 129.7, {{one of the highest}} of the primates. [...] As with all apes, the number of caudal vertebrae has been reduced drastically, resulting in the loss of a functional tail. Gibbons have tough, bony padding on their buttocks, known as the ischial callosities, or sitting pads.|$|R
50|$|In primates, {{the upper}} limbs provide {{a wide range}} of {{movement}} which increases manual dexterity. The limbs of chimpanzees, compared to those of humans, reveal their different lifestyle. The chimpanzee primary uses two modes of locomotion: knuckle-walking, a style of quadrupedalism in which the body weight is supported on the knuckles (or more properly on the middle phalanges of the fingers), and brachiation (swinging from branch to branch), a style of bipedalism in which flexed fingers are used to grasp branches above the head. To meet the requirements of these styles of locomotion, the chimpanzee's finger phalanges are longer and have more robust insertion areas for the flexor tendons while the metacarpals have transverse ridges to limit dorsiflexion (stretching the fingers towards the back of the hand). The thumb is small enough to facilitate brachiation while maintaining some of the dexterity offered by an opposable thumb. In contrast, virtually all locomotion functionality has been lost in humans while predominant <b>brachiators,</b> such as the gibbons, have very reduced thumbs and inflexible wrists.|$|R
40|$|Bone {{is capable}} of {{adapting}} during life in response to stress. Therefore, variation in locomotor and manipulative behaviours across extant hominoids may be reflected in differences in trabecular bone structure. The hand is a promising region for trabecular analysis, {{as it is the}} direct contact between the individual and the environment and joint positions at peak loading vary amongst extant hominoids. Building upon traditional volume of interest-based analyses, we apply a whole-epiphysis analytical approach using high-resolution microtomographic scans of the hominoid third metacarpal to investigate whether trabecular structure reflects differences in hand posture and loading in knuckle-walking (Gorilla, Pan), suspensory (Pongo, Hylobates and Symphalangus) and manipulative (Homo) taxa. Additionally, a comparative phylogenetic method was used to analyse rates of evolutionary changes in trabecular parameters. Results demonstrate that trabecular bone volume distribution and regions of greatest stiffness (i. e., Young’s modulus) correspond with predicted loading of the hand in each behavioural category. In suspensory and manipulative taxa, regions of high bone volume and greatest stiffness are concentrated on the palmar or distopalmar regions of the metacarpal head, whereas knuckle-walking taxa show greater bone volume and stiffness throughout the head, and particularly in the dorsal region; patterns that correspond with the highest predicted joint reaction forces. Trabecular structure in knuckle-walking taxa is characterised by high bone volume fraction and a high degree of anisotropy in contrast to the suspensory <b>brachiators.</b> Humans, in which the hand is use...|$|R
40|$|Gibbons are skilled <b>brachiators</b> {{but they}} are also highly capable leapers, {{crossing}} distances in excess of 10 m in the wild. Despite this impressive performance capability, no detailed biomechanical studies of leaping in gibbons have been undertaken to date. We measured ground reaction forces and derived kinematic parameters from high-speed videos during gibbon leaps in a captive zoo environment. We identified four distinct leap types defined by the number of feet used during take-off and the orientation of the trunk, orthograde single-footed, orthograde two-footed, orthograde squat, and pronograde single-footed leaps. The center of mass trajectories of three of the four leap types were broadly similar, with the pronograde single-footed leaps exhibiting less vertical displacement of the center of mass than the other three types Mechanical energy at take-off was similar in all four leap types. The ratio of kinetic energy to mechanical energy was highest in pronograde single-footed leaps and similar in the other three leap types The highest mechanical work and power were generated during orthograde squat leaps. Take-off angle decreased with take-off velocity and the hind limbs showed a proximal to distal extension sequence during take-off In the forelimbs, the shoulder joints were always flexed at take-off, while the kinematics of the distal joints (elbow and wrist joints) were variable between leaps. It is possible that gibbons may utilize more metabolically expensive orthograde squat leaps when a safe landing is uncertain, while more rapid (less expensive) pronograde single-footed leaps might be used during bouts of rapid locomotion when a safe landing is more certain Am J Phys Anthropol 143 : 403 - 416, 2010 (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Incstatus: publishe...|$|R
