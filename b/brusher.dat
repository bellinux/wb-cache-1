The Way enters Drummin forest, a sitka spruce plantation, where it passes an Adirondack shelter, constructed by Mountain , a volunteer group dedicated to trail preservation that has upgraded various sections of the Wicklow Way over the years. The trail climbs Paddock Hill before descending into a plantation of larch trees. The forest floor here is a habitat for spurges, heath bedstraw and fly agaric toadstools. The trail crosses the Military Road, near Laragh, and then a wooden footbridge across the Glenmacnass River. A dense spread of granite boulders litters the riverbed, glacial erratics deposited by melting glaciers {{at the end of the}} last ice age. This stretch of the trail follows an old mass path through a woodland of many native Irish tree species, including oak, rowan, silver birch and willow, carpeted with a forest floor of bilberry, bluebell and hard fern. The Way continues along forest tracks over the shoulder of Brockagh Mountain. At the highest point there is a vista over the Vale of Glendalough with the two lakes nestled in the shelter of Camaderry and Derrybawn Mountains. Exiting the forest, the Way reaches the R756 road and the Glendalough visitor centre.

40|$|AbstractThe rapid advancements {{in various}} current {{technologies}} {{and the constant}} trend in miniaturizing of components have created a need for higher cleanliness levels. Contamination {{in the level of}} monolayers can drastically alter surface properties such as wettability, adhesion, optical or electrical characteristics. To select an effective cleaning method the three essential factors to be considered such as cleaning chemistry, the scrubbing method and other process parameters. This study investigates the effectiveness of <b>brush</b> cleaning, ultrasonic cleaning and combination of <b>brush</b> and ultrasonic cleaning on removal of contamination, surface defects and <b>brush</b> life time. In this study, the cleaning efficiency was compared for the parts cleaned with ultrasonics, nylon <b>brush,</b> Poly Vinyl Alcohol (PVA) <b>brush</b> and combination of ultrasonics and nylon <b>brush.</b> The life time of <b>brush</b> was studied for both nylon and PVA <b>brush.</b> The techniques used to identify the contamination are SEM, EDX and optical microscope. The microscopic result indicates that the removal efficiency was high for the parts cleaned with ultrasonics (90. 5 %) and PVA <b>brush</b> (90. 2 %) as compared to Nylon <b>brush</b> (77. 4 %). This {{is due to the fact}} that for PVA <b>brush</b> the fluid was being pumped in and out of <b>brush</b> pores (during compression and elastic recovery of the <b>brush),</b> carries the contamination away from the surface and also the contact area between the contamination surface and <b>brush</b> was more. From Liquid Particle Count (LPC) analysis, the > 0. 3 mic particle counts is almost two times lower for parts cleaned with ultrasonics as compared to parts cleaned with <b>brushes.</b> This indicates that 58 / 132 kHz washing followed by 470 kHz DI rinsing effectively removes sub- micron particles from the surface compared to <b>brush</b> cleaning. The defects caused by <b>brushes</b> on the surface of the slider bar is almost 1 % for nylon <b>brush</b> cleaning, 0. 4 % for PVA <b>brush</b> cleaning and 0 % for ultrasonic cleaning. From experimental study, it can be seen that the life time of PVA <b>brush</b> was shorter than Nylon <b>brush</b> by 75 times. The contamination increased after 50 th run for PVA <b>brush</b> and after 700 th run for nylon <b>brush.</b> This is due to the fact that after <b>brush</b> damage (after 50 th run for PVA and 700 th run for nylon) the <b>brush</b> can not effectively remove the contamination and also re-deposition of contamination from <b>brush...</b>|$|R

40|$|The European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD), with {{initiatives}} to manage surface water resources, {{has increased the}} need for fast and inexpensive methods for monitoring conditions in streams. The objective of this thesis is to assess the potential of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) of epilithic material to become such method. NIRS, which is a technique that is commonly used in industry for process monitoring and quality control of products, registers the chemical properties of organic material on a molecular level. Epilithic material, i. e. the layer of dead and alive material that covers stone surfaces in streams, is continuously influenced by the stream water that flows over it, {{and it has the}} potential to integrate chemical and biological conditions over time. The temporal integration is a significant factor, since conditions in streams can change within hours or days. The thesis consists of two published papers. In the first paper a new sampler for epilithic material, the Stone <b>Brusher,</b> was described and the performance evaluated. The Stone <b>Brusher</b> is designed to take qualitative or semi-quantitative samples of epilithic material from stones at 7 – 50 cm water depth. The epilithic material is dislodged from the stone surface with a rotating brush enclosed in a chamber, and the material is drawn up directly into the sample bottle with an air-cylinder. The operator takes a sample quickly and without putting hands into the water. The sampler is made of plastic, stainless steel and aluminium and weighs 3. 1 kg. It is designed to meet the demand for standardized sampling for research and environmental monitoring and to improve working conditions for sampling personnel. The equipment allows sampling from surfaces of bedrock and large stones that cannot be lifted from the bottom. Using data of near-infrared spectroscopy and diatom analyses, this new sampler was evaluated in comparison to the toothbrush method, a primitive method which is the current standard in EU. The results indicate that the Stone <b>Brusher</b> reduces sampling variability compared with the toothbrush method. In the second paper, the Stone <b>Brusher</b> was used to collect epilithic material from 65 sites (42 uncontaminated and 23 contaminated) from streams in the widespread mining area called the Skellefte-district in Västerbotten, northern Sweden, in order to test the hypothesis that impact on the epilithic material caused by emissions from mining and mining-related industries can be detected using NIRS. The epilithic material was filtered onto glass fibre filters, measured by NIRS, and the results were modelled using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The NIRS approach was evaluated by comparing it with the results of chemical and diatom analyses of the same samples. Based on PCA, the NIRS data distinguished contaminated from uncontaminated sites and performed slightly better than chemical analyses and clearly better than diatom analyses. Of the streams designated a priori as contaminated, 74 % were identified as contaminated by NIRS, 65 % by chemical analysis and 26 % by diatom analysis. Unlike chemical analyses of water or of epilithic material samples, NIRS data reflect biological impacts in the streams. Given that, and the simplicity of NIRS-analyses, further studies to assess the use of NIRS of epilithic material are justified. NIRS has the potential to become a fast method for screening in regions where large numbers of streams occur to find impacted streams or as a routine method for temporal monitoring in selected streams for early detection of environmental impact, similar to process monitoring in industry...|$|E

40|$|Background : Non-Stress Test (NST) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common methods used to evaluat fetus health, which its results are {{presented}} as reactive and non-reactive. One of the limitations of this test is the high number of false non-reactive cases. Different studies have suggested a combination of vibroacoustic stimulation and NST to reduce the number of non-reactive cases and duration of the test. Materials and Methods: The present study examined a group of tests, and used simple randomized sampling. The number of the sample was 55 individuals and the data collection tools were NST, sonography instruments, NST result paper, a tooth <b>brusher,</b> a watch, a demographic questionnaire, and a checklist. Vibroacoustic stimulation with an electronic brush was performed on fetus head situated on mother’s abdomen for 3 seconds and then NST was continued for a further 20 minutes.

The combination of vibroacoustic stimulation with the NTS has been shown to reduce non reactive results. Methods: A tests assessment method was chosen with a simple randomized sampling. 40 pregnant women with non reactive NST in the first 20 minutes who received VAS in one of Tehran University's Hospitals were compared with BPP scores. A vibroacoustic stimulation was applied for a 3 seconds on the maternal abdomen and fallowed within 10 minutes. Data collection tools were NST, sonography instruments,NST result paper, tooth <b>brusher,</b> watch, demographic questioner and check list. Data analysis was made by descriptive static and by using the Fisher's Exact Test (with level of significant at p< 0 / 05). All statistical analysis were performed using an spss/win. Results: After VAS, 70 % of non reactive tracing became reactive. All cases with fetal reactivity response after a VAS had a subsequent BPP score of 8 (negative predictive value of 100 %). False positivity of VAS was lower than NST. Conclusion: VAS offers benefits, by decreasing the incidence of non reactive test and reducing test time. VAS lowers the rate of false positive NST.

40|$|The River {{continuum}} concept (RCC) (Vannote et al. 1980) {{attempted to}} provide a unifying theory of river function. The Functional Feeding Group (FFG) concept (Cummins 1973, 1974) became {{a major component of}} the RCC. The FFG concept provides testable hypotheses about the changes in proportions of FFGs along a downstream gradient in a river, in response to the changing nature of food resources. The following short-comings of the FFG concept have been identified: 1) the variability of macroinvertebrate feeding, 2) problems with gut analysis as a method for assigning taxa to FFGs, and 3) inconsistent criteria defining FFGs. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the macroinvertebrate fauna of the Buffalo River in order to assess the applicability of aspects of the RCC and the FFG concept. The specific aims of the study were: 1) to describe the distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages in the Buffalo River; 2) to clarify aspects of the FFG concept listed above; 3) to establish whether selected taxa could be assigned to FFGs; 4) to assess whether the proportions of different FFGs in successive reaches of a southern African river conformed to the predictions of the RCC; and 5) to test whether a functional classification is a useful alternative to a taxonomic classification. Macroinvertebrates were collected seasonally from a variety of biotopes at three sites, one each in the upper, middle and lower reaches. Riffles were sampled in summer at 16 sites. Over 100 taxa were identified and an hierarchical classification was prepared using two-way indicator species analysis. Invertebrate assemblages in the narrow headwater stream were taxonomically distinct from those of the middle/lower reaches and were not positively associated with subjectively identified biotopes. Biotopes were characterised by distinct assemblages in the wider middle/lower reaches. Sixteen abundant taxa whose feeding had not been previously investigated were selected for feeding studies, four from the headwaters and 12 from the middle/lower reaches. Methods used included gut content analysis, behavioural observations, food choice experiments and morphological studies using scanning electron microscopy. Three aspects of the functional feeding group concept were clarified. 1) Dietary variability was assessed using gut contents as an index of diet. The gut contents of both early (small) and late (large) instar larvae of all 16 taxa collected from different sites and biotopes, and in different seasons were compared using a multifactor analysis of variance. For all taxa the most consistently significant differences in gut contents were between large and small larvae. These were due to differences in the amount of material in the gut and in varying amounts of rarer dietary items. Dietary variability did not prevent taxa from being assigned to FFGs. 2) Gut content analysis satisfactorily provided basic information about the feeding biology of taxa but proved to be an inadequate single method for positively assigning taxa to FFGs. 3) Before taxa could be assigned to FFGs the definitions for some FFG categories had to be described clearly. It is suggested that the term shredder be based on the observation of shredding and a predominance of leaf fragments in the foregut. The presence of algae was not diagnostic of scrapers and a morphological basis is suggested. A morphological basis for the <b>brusher</b> FFG is described for the first time. All 16 taxa were assigned to FFGs. Three headwater taxa were shredders ((Goerodes caffrariae (Lepidostomatidae), Dyschimus ensifer (Pisulidae), Afronemoura spp. (Notonemouridae)) and one was a collector:brusher (Adenophlebia auriculata (Leptophlebiidae). These results were consistent with RCC predictions. All 12 of the taxa from the middle/lower reaches were filterers or collectors and this result was also consistent with RCC predictions. The Hydropsychidae, Cheumtopsyche afra and Macrostemum capense, were passive net filterers; Neurocaenis reticulatus (Tricorythidae) was a passive setal filterer; Caenidae sp. Band Pseudocloeon maculosum (Baetidae) were active filterers; caenidae sp. A, and the Baetidae, Baetis harrisoni, Centroptilum excisum and Cloeon africanum, were collector: gatherers; the Leptophlebiidae, Choroterpes elegans and Choroterpes nigrescens, were collector:brushers; and Afronurus harrisoni (Heptageniidae) was a scraper. Gut content analyses alone were insufficient to assign taxa to FFGs, but when augmented by morphological and/or behavioural data, taxa could be assigned to FFGs with confidence. In all cases the FFG designation referred to the most frequent style of feeding. N. reticulatus, A. harrisoni and A. auriculata were particularly flexible in their feeding behaviour. A functional classification of macro invertebrates in the Buffalo River was compared with a taxonomic classification. In both cases similar groups were identified, but their taxonomic and functional descriptions yielded different information. It is suggested that functional and taxonomic classifications should be viewed as complementary rather than alternative options. ...|$|E
