5|$|The first volume, Into the Wild, {{was written}} by Kate Cary under the {{pseudonym}} Erin Hunter, and completed in about three months. Holmes continued to act behind the scenes editing and supervising details. Afterwards, Holmes began to {{like the idea of}} using cats since she realized how thoughtful they can <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> private lives without any humans realizing.|$|E
5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, {{even if he is}} seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} months of winter {{darkness}} Joyce and Wild printed around 30copies of the expedition's book, Aurora Australis, which were sewn and bound using packaging materials. The most important winter's work, however, {{was preparing for}} the following season's major journeys, which were to include attempts on both the South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. By making his base in McMurdo Sound, Shackleton {{had been able to}} reinstate the Magnetic Pole as an expedition objective. Shackleton himself would <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> the South Pole journey, which had suffered a serious setback during the winter when four of the remaining ponies died, mainly from eating volcanic sand for its salt content.|$|E

5|$|Pérez Balladares later {{served as}} {{campaign}} manager for Carlos Duque, Noriega's chosen candidate for the 1989 presidential election. The opposition candidate, Guillermo Endara, was reported by international observers to <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> the vote by a 3-to-1 margin, but the results were annulled by the Noriega government before counting was complete. During the December 1989 US invasion of Panama, however, Endara was certified the election's winner and sworn in as {{the next president of}} Panama. During the invasion, Pérez Balladares was briefly detained and interrogated by US forces for his association with Noriega, but was then released.|$|E

25|$|Technology is {{properly}} defined as any application of science {{to accomplish a}} function. The science can <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane, but it is all technology, and its exploitation {{is the foundation of}} all competitive advantage.|$|E

25|$|Merchants {{were seen}} as {{somewhat}} parasitic {{to the needs of}} all other groups in society, since it was acknowledged that they used the goods that others produced and made their own profits from them. In essence, they {{were seen as}} business savvy, but not morally cultivated enough to <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> members of society or highly venerated representatives of Chinese culture.|$|E
25|$|The FAO program prepares U.S. {{military}} officers and officers of allied nations to <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> regional experts {{and to serve}} in key political-military assignments throughout Eurasia. While each FAO executes a unique, tailored, individual training program, most FAOs can expect to spend 12–18 months living, working, and traveling in Eurasia, as well as participating in Marshall Center activities. After completing the program, FAOs {{will go on to}} serve in U.S. embassies in the region, on NATO and major U.S. theater command staffs, and on numerous operational missions throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|International {{discussions were}} going on about a new state in North Iraq, based {{on the concept of}} Iraq Federation. UN {{channelled}} money to Iraq Federation. With inclusion of the solution for elimination of the PKK's ability to use North Iraq, Turkey joined the US-led coalition to bring truce among the Iraqi Kurds. Two sets of negotiations were tried.

25|$|In March 1882, Captain Henri Rivière again visited Hanoi {{with three}} gunboats and 700 men {{in order to}} obtain a trade agreement. Following some provocations, Rivière {{captured}} Hanoi in April 1882. Again the Black Flags counter-attacked, and Rivière was killed in May 1883 in the Battle of Paper Bridge, leading to a huge movement in favour of a massive armed intervention in France. Credits were voted for, and a large force of 4,000 men and 29 warships (including 4 ironclads) was sent. Admiral Amédée Courbet would <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> the force in Tonkin, while Admiral Meyer would operate in China.|$|E
25|$|In May 1974, a {{month after}} the Carnation Revolution, Sá Carneiro founded the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), {{together}} with Francisco Pinto Balsemão, Joaquim Magalhães Mota, Carlos Mota Pinto, João Bosco Mota Amaral, Alberto João Jardim, António Barbosa de Melo and António Marques Mendes, and became its secretary-general. The PPD was soon renamed the Social Democratic Party (PSD); despite Sá Carneiro's original claims to <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> a left-of-centre party, he and the party soon drifted to the right. He was minister without portfolio in a number of provisional governments, and was elected as a deputy to the Constitutional Assembly the next year.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, Featherston drifts for a short while, before joining the newly created Freedom Party. Featherston establishes himself as head propagandist, and eventually becomes its leader, aided by Party member Ferdinand Koenig. With his raw energy and humble origins, Featherston has little trouble whipping up support from much of the Confederate populace, and it seems by the early 1920s that he would surely <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> the country. But with the assassination of President Wade Hampton V in June 1922 by a Party stalwart, the Freedom Party suffers a sudden and near-total collapse as a political force.|$|E

25|$|Paul VI did renounce many {{traditional}} {{symbols of the}} papacy and the Catholic Church; some of his changes to the papal dress were reversed by Pope Benedict XVI in the early 21st century. Refusing a Vatican army of colourful military uniforms from centuries, he got rid of them. He became the first pope to visit five continents. Paul VI systematically continued and completed the efforts of his predecessors, to turn the Euro-centric Church into a Church of the world, by integrating the bishops from all continents in its government and in the Synods which he convened. His 6 August 1967 motu proprio Pro Comperto Sane opened the Roman Curia to the bishops of the world. Until then, only Cardinals could <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> members of the Curia.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, Bose was placed under house-arrest by the Raj. He escaped in {{disguise}} {{and made his way}} through Afghanistan and Central -Asia. He came first to the Soviet Union and then to Germany, reaching Berlin on 2 April 1941. There he -sought to raise an army of Indian soldiers from prisoners of war captured by Germany, forming the Free India Legion and the Azad Hind Radio. The Japanese ambassador, Oshima Hiroshi, kept Tokyo informed of these developments. From the very start of the war, the Japanese intelligence services noted from speaking to captured Indian soldiers that Bose was held in extremely high regard as a nationalist and was considered by Indian soldiers to be the right person to <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> a rebel army.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Australia was {{scheduled}} to tour England {{to play for the}} Ashes. Before the squad was selected, Greg Chappell announced that he would not <b>be</b> <b>leading</b> the Australian team, citing business and family reasons. In his absence, the Australian Cricket Board turned to Hughes as captain. The Australian team arrived in England in May and was greeted by rain, leaving them short of needed match practice. Nevertheless, Hughes and his team unexpectedly won the preliminary One Day International series. The first Test was played at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. Australia won the low scoring and rain affected match by six wickets, after Hughes had taken the opportunity to put England into bat after winning the toss. Australia then had the best of a drawn match in the second Test at Lord's. After making a pair in this match, Ian Botham resigned his position as captain of England.|$|E
