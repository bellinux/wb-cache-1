50|$|The first length {{standards}} {{to use this}} technique were rectangular section solid bars. A <b>blind</b> <b>hole</b> was <b>bored</b> at each end, to {{the depth of the}} neutral plane, and the calibration marks were made at this depth. This was inconvenient, as it was impossible to measure directly between the two marks, but only with an offset trammel down the wells.|$|R
5000|$|Single-point threading, {{where the}} {{workpiece}} is rotated, and a pointed cutting tool is {{fed into the}} workpiece {{at the same rate}} as the pitch of the internal thread. Single-pointing inside a <b>blind</b> <b>hole,</b> like <b>boring</b> inside one, is inherently more challenging than doing so in a through hole. This was especially true in the era when manual machining was the only method of control. Today, CNC makes these tasks less stressful, but nevertheless still more challenging than with through holes.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are various}} types of boring.

Backboring (back boring, back-boring) is the process of reaching through an existing <b>hole</b> and then <b>boring</b> on the [...] "back" [...] side of the workpiece (relative to the machine headstock).|$|R

50|$|A <b>blind</b> <b>hole</b> {{refers to}} a hole that is reamed, drilled, or milled to a {{specified}} depth without breaking through {{to the other side}} of the workpiece. The etymology is that it is not possible to see through a <b>blind</b> <b>hole.</b> Other types of holes also include through holes, and clearance holes. In this instance blind may also refer to any feature that is taken to a specific depth, more specifically referring to internally threaded hole (tapped holes). Not considering the drill point, the depth of the <b>blind</b> <b>hole,</b> conventionally, may be slightly deeper than that of the threaded depth.|$|R

40|$|<b>Blind</b> <b>holes</b> 5 mu m in {{diameter}} and 25 mu m deep were filled with copper electrodeposited from a copper sulfate electrolyte containing chloride ions, a suppressor, and an accelerator. A thin tantalum layer was deposited {{on top of a}} copper seed layer to locally inhibit the subsequent electrodeposition of copper. A clear difference appeared {{in the evolution of the}} cathode potential recorded during the galvanostatic deposition of copper on either copper metallized flat substrates or substrates containing copper metallized recessed <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> and selectively coated with Ta at the outside. The different steps during the filling of <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> by electrolytic copper were monitored and analyzed based on the evolution of the cathode potential during electrodeposition. An electrochemical depolarization of the electrode surface induced by an accelerating species occurred first. The subsequent evolution of the potential was dominated by a change in the electrode surface that occurs during the superfilling of <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> with copper. Finally, the time to achieve a complete filling of <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> with electrolytic copper was determined. A deeper insight on the superfilling mechanism with electrodeposited copper was obtained. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Using {{magneto-optical}} imaging technique, we map local {{magnetic field}} distribution inside a hexagonally ordered array of <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> patterned in BSCCO single crystals. The {{nature of the}} spatial distribution of local magnetic field and shielding currents across the array reveals {{the presence of a}} non-uniform vortex configuration partially matched with the <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> at sub-matching fields. We observe that the filling fraction is different in two different regions of the array. The mean vortex configuration within the array is described as a patchy vortex configuration with the patches having different mean filling fraction. The patchy nature of the vortex configuration is more pronounced at partial filling of the array at low fields while the configuration becomes more uniform with a unique filling fraction at higher fields. The metastable nature of this patchy vortex configuration is revealed by the application of magnetic field pulses of fixed height or individual pulses of varying height to the array. The metastability of the vortex configuration allows for a relatively easy way of producing flux reorganization and flux focusing effects within the <b>blind</b> <b>hole</b> array. Effect of the magnetic field pulses modifies the vortex configuration within the array and produces a uniform enhancement in the shielding current around the patterned array edges. The enhanced shielding current concentrates magnetic flux within the array by driving vortices away from the edges and towards the center of the array. The enhanced shielding current also prevents the uninhibited entry of vortices into the array. We propose that the metastable patchy vortex configuration within the <b>blind</b> <b>hole</b> array is due to a non-uniform pinning landscape leading to non-uniform filling of individual <b>blind</b> <b>holes.</b> Comment: 15 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
