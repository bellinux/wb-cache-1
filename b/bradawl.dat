5|$|Examination of the {{wreckage}} revealed that large portions of the wings' skin were badly glued and {{that a number of}} rib caps and stringers were not glued at all. Many panel pins were not connected to the structure at all and many of the <b>bradawl</b> holes necessary to equalize pressure between the inside of the wing and the outside were missing entirely. The crash of such an advanced aircraft shocked the entire industry and caused a six-month hiatus in design work. Polikarpov overreacted to its loss and built the structure of a number of his subsequent aircraft stronger, and thus, heavier, than it needed to be. All further work on the project was abandoned following the crash, nominally for lack of a suitable engine.|$|E

60|$|Then I {{turned and}} ran, or rather waddled, for in that gear I could not run, {{out of the}} chamber until the rock wall beyond stayed me, and there, with my back towards her, thrust my helmeted head against it, for I felt as though red-hot <b>bradawls</b> had been plunged into my eyes. So I stood while she laughed and mocked behind me until at length I heard the door close and the blessed {{darkness}} came like a gift from Heaven.|$|R
6000|$|Pembroke Howard, {{lawyer and}} bachelor, aged almost forty, was another old Virginian grandee with proved descent from the First Families. He was a fine, majestic creature, a gentleman {{according}} to the nicest requirements of the Virginia rule, a devoted Presbyterian, an authority on the [...] "code", and a man always courteously ready to stand up before you in the field if any act or word of his had seemed doubtful or suspicious to you, and explain it with any weapon you might prefer from <b>bradawls</b> to artillery. He was very popular with the people, and was the judge's dearest friend.|$|R

60|$|Another {{discovery}} {{of great interest}} was the carpenter's cabin. Unlike {{most of the other}} cabins, the door of this one was locked, and the key gone, though if it had been there no one would have guessed its use. Peeping in through a crack, however, Cheenbuk saw so many desirable things that he made short work of the obstruction by plunging his weight against it. The door went down with a crash, and the Eskimo on the top of it. The sight that met his gaze amply repaid him, however, for there were collected in symmetrical array on the walls, saws, chisels, gimlets, gouges, <b>bradawls,</b> etcetera, while on a shelf lay planes, mallets, hammers, nails, augers--in short, every variety of boring, hammering, and cutting implement that can be imagined.|$|R
60|$|Suiting {{the action}} to the word, he thrust her rather {{suddenly}} and prematurely into a chair, and designing {{to reassure her}} by a little harmless jocularity, such as is adapted to please and fascinate the sex, converted his right forefinger into an ideal <b>bradawl</b> or gimlet, and made as though he would screw the same into her side--whereat Miss Miggs shrieked again, and evinced symptoms of faintness.|$|E

60|$|His face, though {{aged and}} shrunken, was fine-featured {{and full of}} breeding, while {{his hands and feet}} were very small; his eyes were brooding, the eyes of a mystic, but when his {{interest}} was excited their glance was as sharp as a <b>bradawl.</b> Just now it was fixed on Thomas, who felt as if it were piercing him through and through. The owner of the eyes, as Thomas guessed at once, was Menzi, a witch-doctor very famous in those parts.|$|E
60|$|Mr Bickersdyke was {{reclining}} in an easy-chair in {{the first}} room, staring before him in the boiled-fish manner customary in a Turkish Bath. Psmith dropped into the next seat with a cheery 'Good evening.' The manager started as if some firm hand had driven a <b>bradawl</b> into him. He looked at Psmith with what {{was intended to be}} a dignified stare. But dignity is hard to achieve in a couple of parti-coloured towels. The stare did not differ to any great extent from the conventional boiled-fish look, alluded to above.|$|E
60|$|This design {{he was now}} hastening to {{put into}} execution. Attended by fifty trusty {{followers}} under the lead of Carlo the Corkscrew and Beowulf the <b>Bradawl,</b> {{he had made his}} way to Ghent. Under cover of night they had reached the foot of the castle cliff; and now, on their hands and knees in single file, they were crawling round and round the spiral path that led up to the gate of the fortress. At six of the clock they had spiralled once. At seven of the clock they had reappeared at the second round, and as the feast in the hall reached its height, they reappeared on the fourth lap.|$|E
60|$|When {{they were}} joined by the archdeacon on the gravel before the vicarage, they descended again to grave dullness. Not that Archdeacon Grantly was a dull man, but his frolic humours were of a {{cumbrous}} kind, and his wit, when he was witty, did not generally extend itself to his auditors. On the present occasion he was soon making speeches about wounded roofs and walls, which he declared to be in want of some surgeon's art. There was not a partition that he did not tap, nor a block of chimneys that he did not narrowly examine; all water-pipes, flues, cisterns, and sewers underwent an investigation; he even descended, in the care of his friend, so far as to bore sundry boards in the floors with a <b>bradawl.</b>|$|E

Children together, and all that sort of rot. Now there's nobody I think a more corking sportsman than Maud, if you know what I mean, but--this is where the catch comes in--I'm most frightfully in love with {{somebody}} else. Hopeless, and all that sort of thing, but still there it is. And all the while the mater behind me with a <b>bradawl,</b> sicking me on to propose to Maud who wouldn't have me if I were the only fellow on earth. You can't imagine, my dear old chap, what a relief it was to both of us when she told me the other day that {{she was in love with}} you, and wouldn't dream of looking at anybody else.

5000|$|A <b>bradawl</b> {{is used to}} make {{indentations}} in wood {{or other}} materials in order to ease the insertion of a nail or screw. The blade is placed across the fibres of the wood, cutting them when pressure is applied. The <b>bradawl</b> is then twisted through 90 degrees which displaces the fibres creating a hole. This cutting action helps to prevent splitting of the wood along the grain.|$|E

5000|$|A gimlet {{is always}} a small tool. A similar tool of larger size is called an auger. The cutting action of the gimlet is {{slightly}} different from an auger, however, {{as the end of}} the screw, and so the initial hole it makes, is smaller; the cutting edges pare away the wood which is moved out by the spiral sides, falling out through the entry hole. This also pulls the gimlet farther into the hole as it is turned; unlike a <b>bradawl,</b> pressure is not required once the tip has been drawn in.|$|E

5000|$|Modern brogues {{trace their}} roots to a {{rudimentary}} shoe originating in Scotland and Ireland that was constructed using untanned hide. Modern brogues feature decorative perforations. These are often said {{to stem from}} the original Irish brogues as well, specifically from holes intended to allow water to drain from the shoes when the wearer crossed wet terrain such as a bog. However, contemporary descriptions of the original brogues do not mention such holes. The word [...] "brogue" [...] came into English in the late sixteenth century. It comes from the Gaelic bróg (Irish), bròg (Scottish) [...] "shoe", from the Old Norse [...] "brók" [...] meaning [...] "leg covering". The Scots word brogue {{is also used to}} denote a <b>bradawl</b> or boring tool as well as the action of piercing with such a tool.|$|E
5000|$|On 3 December 1891, Johnston's {{party were}} offered free shelter by King Lewanika. Johnston had respect for Lewanika as he offered help without pre-negotiating a price. Lewanika told Johnston {{how he had}} written to the British asking that his kingdom should be made a British Protectorate. He had waited years for a reply and then men had arrived with papers {{claiming}} {{that they had the}} power to make this happen. The King was reassured as the local missionary. Monsier Coillard, was his interpreter at the meeting and the King was reassured by Coillard's confidence in these men. Lewanika had been thankful that his wish had been granted and he had sent two enormous elephant ivory tusks as a present for Queen Victoria. Lewanika was incensed to find that the men were from a South African company and that the ivory tusks were not with Queen Victoria but as ornaments in the directors board room. Johnston assisted Lewanika in writing a letter of protest. Lewanika was to prove a great help to Johnston as he was able to command assistance for Johnston from nearby subordinate chiefs.On December 10th he met Coillard. Coillard ran a successful mission although his wife had recently died. Coillard was the missionary who had interpreted for Lewanika. Coillard was annoyed that Lewanika had been tricked by men who would consider themselves respectable. He was also annoyed that this affair had undermined the trust that he had built up with the King over many years. Johnston stayed for some time and witnessed a New Year's Eve firework display organised by the missionary. There was also a religious service that day but Johnston noted that few attended the service whilst many saw the fireworks. On New Year's Day 1891 the first Christian wedding of native Africans at the Coillard mission took place. The groom was Letia who was the son of King Lewanika and his bride was Katusi. Johnston witnessed the feast after the wedding which Coillard had funded. The guests were to sit at tables and chairs but the bride had never sat on a chair and Lewanika refused to sit at a table with women. The women included Lewanika's wives and Queen Macqui who was Lewanika's sister. Johnston noted that Letia took Christian marriage vows of fidelity, but he remained faithful for only a few months before taking another wife and renouncing Christianity.Johnston was very impressed by the Coillard's mission which included a practical man named Mr. Waddell and a Swiss missionary named Miss Keiner. Johnston did not approve of single ladies as missionaries but he was impressed with the high standard of progress and workmanship he saw around the mission and its buildings. He witnessed [...] "a fine saw-mill with six span of oxen for the motor power, brick-making machines, smithy with patent forge, miner's workshop, fitted with every tool the mechanic requires, from a <b>bradawl</b> to a turning-lathe". Johnston had been to a number of missions and he singled out the Coillard mission for its high standards. This mission like all the African mission he observed that there was a large difference between the tales of mass conversions to the reality of staying alive in an unfamiliar environment.|$|E
