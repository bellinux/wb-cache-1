5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{names for}} crow or raven species include very {{possibly}} gbgb/gbg3; this bird is once called 3pd km or 'black bird', while its eggs could apparently <b>be</b> <b>gathered</b> {{according to a}} medical papyrus, and therefore points to a breeding bird of Egypt. In demotic an ʾbḳ-bird can be determined by help {{of the existence of}} Coptic abook 'Crow, raven'. But perhaps the latter is also a derivatiuon of the bird name kbk.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to battling on foot, mecha specific to a character can be summoned. While each mech has a fixed main pilot, the sub-pilot can be changed, which alters {{the types of}} attacks the mech can perform. After defeating the enemy, the party receives experience points which raise their basic statistics, and skill points which are used to upgrade each character's skill tree, unlocking new skills. New items and accessories can only <b>be</b> <b>gathered</b> either through searching the environment or defeating enemies, as currency and shops are not present.|$|E
5|$|S.thiersii may <b>be</b> <b>gathered</b> {{inadvertently}} {{and thought}} to be edible {{due to the fact}} that it grows on lawns among grasses. This is in contrast to Amanita species which grow around trees and are thus usually seen in forests. It can be distinguished from other white fungi growing in grassland by its fluffy cap, though the white veil fragments may eventually get washed away by rain.|$|E

5|$|The {{appearance}} {{and evolution of}} medieval warships {{is a matter of}} debate and conjecture: until recently, no remains of an oared warship from either ancient or early medieval times had been found, and information had to <b>be</b> <b>gathered</b> by analyzing literary evidence, crude artistic depictions and the remains of a few merchant vessels. Only in 2005–2006 did archaeological digs for the Marmaray project in the location of the Harbour of Theodosius (modern Yenikapi) uncover the remains of over 36 Byzantine ships from the 6th to 10th centuries, including four light galleys of the galea type.|$|E
5|$|Each level {{contains}} items {{the player}} can collect, such as coins, which can <b>be</b> <b>gathered</b> by either smashing Buzz Cola vending machines, Buzz Cola boxes or wasp cameras, {{the latter of}} which become more elusive as the game progresses. The coins {{can be used to}} buy new cars and player outfits, some of which are required to progress through the game. The player can also collect Itchy and Scratchy cards. By collecting all 49 of them, seven in each level, the player unlocks a special The Itchy & Scratchy Show video. Several events cause the player to lose coins; because the character cannot die, injuries cause the player to lose coins. If the player is apprehended during a hit and run, they will be fined 50 coins.|$|E
5|$|For pharmacology, Shen {{wrote of}} the {{difficulties}} of adequate diagnosis and therapy, {{as well as the}} proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs. He held great concern for detail and philological accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should <b>be</b> <b>gathered,</b> their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, and other matters of horticulture. In the realms of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, and minerals found in China. For example, Shen noted that the mineral orpiment was used to quickly erase writing errors on paper.|$|E

5|$|Invertebrates {{constitute}} {{a vast array}} of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as Paramecium to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus, lobster and dragonfly. They {{constitute a}}bout 95% of the animal species. By definition, none of these creatures has a backbone. The cells of single-cell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs. Locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia, food may <b>be</b> <b>gathered</b> by phagocytosis, energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton. Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.|$|E
5|$|James of Saint George, {{a famous}} {{architect}} and engineer from Savoy, was probably {{responsible for the}} bulk of the construction work across the region. The castles were extremely costly to build and required labourers, masons, carpenters, diggers, and building resources to <b>be</b> <b>gathered</b> by local sheriffs from across England, mustered at Chester and Bristol, before being sent on to North Wales in the spring, returning home each winter. The number of workers involved placed a significant drain on the country's national labour force. The total financial cost cannot be calculated with certainty, but estimates suggest that Edward's castle building programme cost at least £80,000 – four times the total royal expenditure on castles between 1154 and 1189.|$|E
5|$|Other seeds, such as apple pips and plum stones, have fleshy {{receptacles}} {{and smaller}} fruits like hawthorns have seeds enclosed in edible tissue; animals including mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the seeds, or swallow {{them so they}} pass through the gut to be deposited in the animal's droppings {{well away from the}} parent tree. The germination of some seeds is improved when they are processed in this way. Nuts may <b>be</b> <b>gathered</b> by animals such as squirrels that cache any not immediately consumed. Many of these caches are never revisited, the nut-casing softens with rain and frost, and the seed germinates in the spring. Pine cones may similarly be hoarded by red squirrels, and grizzly bears may help to disperse the seed by raiding squirrel caches.|$|E

5|$|Routine care {{during the}} growing season {{involves}} keeping the rows free of competing weeds, especially when the plants are young. The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need a great deal of water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can <b>be</b> <b>gathered</b> when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be kept in storage, they should be harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left {{on the surface of the}} soil for a few days to dry out properly, then they can be placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They should be stored in a well-ventilated, cool place such as a shed.|$|E
5|$|The {{main source}} for {{information}} on the missionaries is the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum of the medieval writer Bede, written around 731. Bede details several {{of the members of the}} mission. Another important source of information is the papal registers which list copies of Gregory's letters sent to the missionaries. Neither source gives a complete listing of the missionaries in either group, so a listing of members must <b>be</b> <b>gathered</b> from scattered references in Bede and Gregory's letters. Although it is known that about 40 people were included in the first group, how many arrived in the second group is unknown. The vagaries of the evidence allow only some of the missionaries to be named.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanics}} of crafting and gathering have changed between the original release and A Realm Reborn. Most {{of these changes}} are geared toward reducing the randomness and guesswork involved in these processes. For Disciples of the Hand, all recipes of the appropriate level are unlocked by default in the Crafting Log. Crafting abilities have been rebalanced to allow successful high-quality synthesis without requiring multiple mastered Disciplines of the Hand. For Disciples of the Land, players are allowed to select which item {{they would like to}} attempt to collect at a gathering point, whereas before, the results of gathering attempts were randomized. The Gathering Log also displays the names and locations of items that can <b>be</b> <b>gathered</b> in the world.|$|E

5|$|The player kills enemies {{by firing}} daggers from their fingers. There are two firing options: {{clicking}} the left-mouse button fires a shotgun-like blast of daggers {{with a wide}} spread, and holding the mouse button down fires a precise, continuous stream of daggers. Some enemies have weak spots indicated by red crystals on their bodies. Once dead, the red crystals are dropped and can <b>be</b> <b>gathered</b> by the player to obtain attack upgrades, such as increased damage and homing daggers. The player dies when coming into physical contact with an enemy or falling off the stage. At {{the top of the}} screen, a timer displays how long the playthrough has lasted. The player's best survival time is published on a global leaderboard. Accessed via the leaderboard, replays of playthroughs can be downloaded and watched from either a first-person view or a top-down perspective.|$|E
5|$|As {{the people}} inside the church scattered, the Mouzalon {{brothers}} tried to hide: George hid under the altar, Andronikos behind a door, and Theodore in a corner by the emperor's tomb. The mob, however, proceeded to search the church for them, and George was discovered by a Latin soldier named Karoulos ("Charles"). Mouzalon was dragged from under the altar and, despite pleading to ransom his life, was executed. So great was the frenzy of the crowd that his corpse was repeatedly stabbed and hacked to pieces, so that the parts had to <b>be</b> <b>gathered</b> in a sack for burial afterwards. Andronikos and an unnamed brother-in-law too were slain, while Theodore's fate is uncertain: some scholars believe he survived and is {{to be identified with}} Theodore Mouzalon, a chief minister to both Michael VIII and Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328). The Mouzalon family's houses were then ransacked by the mob; and when George Mouzalon's wife fled to her uncle Michael Palaiologos and pleaded for her husband's life, she was brusquely told to be quiet or she would share his fate. Palaiologos's responsibility in the whole affair is further supported by the fact that none of the Mouzalones' murderers were ever prosecuted. Indeed, the mercenary Charles appears later as Palaiologos's confidant.|$|E
5|$|In the {{run up to}} the {{announcement}} that an invasion force was {{to be sent to}} Guatemala, 10,000 Nahua warriors had already been assembled by the Aztec emperor Cuauhtémoc to accompany the Spanish expedition. Warriors were ordered to <b>be</b> <b>gathered</b> from each of the Mexica and Tlaxcaltec towns. The native warriors supplied their own weapons, including swords, clubs and bows and arrows. Alvarado's army left Tenochtitlan {{at the beginning of the}} dry season, sometime between the second half of November and December 1523. As Alvarado left the Aztec capital, he led about 400 Spanish and approximately 200 Tlaxcaltec and Cholultec warriors and 100 Mexica, meeting up with the gathered reinforcements on the way. When the army left the Basin of Mexico, it may have included as many as 20,000 native warriors from various kingdoms although the exact numbers are disputed. By the time the army crossed the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the massed native warriors included 800 from Tlaxcala, 400 from Huejotzingo, 1600 from Tepeaca plus many more from other former Aztec territories. Further Mesoamerican warriors were recruited from the Zapotec and Mixtec provinces, with the addition of more Nahuas from the Aztec garrison in Soconusco.|$|E

5|$|The {{removal of}} Kammhuber as {{commanding}} officer of night air defences in September 1943 did not prevent further appeals for the reinstatement of intruder operations. His replacement as General der Nachtjagd (General of Night Fighters), was Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) Joseph Schmid, commanding 1. Jagdkorps (1st Fighter Corps). Schmid had long argued for a repeat of intruder operations and first pressed for their resumption in December 1943. His proposals were rejected by Göring {{on the grounds that}} intruder operations were not his business. Schmid did not receive substantive support from other field commanders, most notably Hans-Jürgen Stumpff, who objected to the operation after meeting with Schmid in January and February 1944 on the grounds that Hitler opposed such operations and newer German radar was not to fall into Allied hands. Four months later, attitudes had not changed. Generalmajor Dietrich Peltz, commanding Angriffsführer England (Bomber Leader England) and IX. Fliegerkorps showed little interest in intruder missions either, since his remaining forces were engaged in night attacks against the Allied beachheads in Normandy. In October 1944, he finally won support from Werner Streib, Inspekteur der Nachtjagd (Inspector of Night Fighters) to press for an operation again. The plan was simple; a large force of 600—700 night fighters were to <b>be</b> <b>gathered</b> and sent out in one simultaneous operation.|$|E
