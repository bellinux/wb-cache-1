5|$|If early {{tetrapods}} {{lived in}} freshwater, {{and if they}} {{lost the ability to}} produce urea and used ammonia only, they would have to evolve it from scratch again later. Not a single species of all the ray-finned fishes living today has <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> so it is not likely the tetrapods would have done so either. Terrestrial animals that can only produce ammonia would have to drink constantly, making a life on land impossible (a few exceptions exist, as some terrestrial woodlice can excrete their nitrogenous waste as ammonia gas). This probably also was a problem at the start when the tetrapods started to spend time out of water, but eventually the urea system would dominate completely. Because of this it is not likely they emerged in freshwater (unless they first migrated into freshwater habitats and then migrated onto land so shortly after that they still retained the ability to make urea), although some species never left, or returned to, the water could of course have adapted to freshwater lakes and rivers.|$|E
25|$|During the 1930s, de Valera had {{systematically}} {{stripped down}} the Irish Free State constitution {{that had been}} drafted by a committee under the nominal chairmanship of his rival, Michael Collins. In reality, de Valera had <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> only due to three reasons. First, though the 1922 constitution originally required a public plebiscite for any amendment beyond eight years after its passage, the Free State government under W. T. Cosgrave had amended that period to sixteen years. This meant that, until 1938, the Free State constitution could be amended by the simple passage of a Constitutional Amendment Act through the Oireachtas. Secondly, while the Governor-General of the Irish Free State could reserve or deny Royal Assent to any legislation, from 1927, the power to advise the governor-general to do so no longer rested with the British government in London but with His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State, which meant that, in practice, the Royal Assent was automatically granted to legislation; the government was hardly likely to advise the governor-general to block the enactment {{of one of its}} own bills. Thirdly, in theory the constitution had to be in keeping with the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the fundamental law of the state. However, that requirement had been removed only a short time before de Valera gained power.|$|E
500|$|The Hot Rock is the {{follow-up}} to Sleater-Kinney's highly acclaimed third album Dig Me Out, released in 1997by the independent record label Kill Rock Stars. After {{the success of}} Dig Me Out and its predecessor Call the Doctor, several major record labels grew interested in the band and offered them recording contracts, but the band ultimately decided to remain on Kill Rock Stars. As singer and guitarist Corin Tucker recalls, [...] "We want to project the image that we're successful". Co-vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein added, [...] "And we're proud that we've <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> from a tiny label [...] We've {{been able to do}} it non-traditionally, and hopefully that's inspiring and encouraging to people".|$|E

500|$|Cox was 30 {{years old}} at the time she was cast, making her the show's second oldest main cast member, and was 39 by the {{beginning}} of Friends final season. Additionally, this distinction makes Cox older than her on-screen brother, actor David Schwimmer, who portrays her older brother Ross, who is one year her senior. The actress would deliver Monica's lines emphatically. Although each character is depicted as an avid coffee drinker, spending much of their free time in a coffee house, Cox herself does not drink coffee, and was only pretending to drink it out of mugs on the show. Kauffman believes that Cox's own cleanliness closely resembles her character's; at times the actress would clean her co-stars' dressing rooms. Cox also shares the character's motherly nature. The actress enjoyed portraying Monica she was able to [...] "bring more of my own personality to her, and I've never really <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> before." [...] Starpulse.com observed that [...] "As Monica, Cox never quite enjoyed the sort of watercooler storylines that co-star ... Jennifer Aniston had with David Schwimmer as the on-again, off-again Rachel and Ross." [...] At one point, Cox had begun to regret her decision to accept the role of Monica over Rachel due to the character's lack of strong storylines; she eventually relented once Monica and Chandler became romantically involved, thus her character's storylines gradually began to improve.|$|E
2500|$|Film {{historian}} Jeffrey Vance {{said that}} Garbo communicated her characters' innermost feelings through her movement, gestures, and most importantly, her eyes. With the slightest movement of them, he argues, she subtly conveyed complex attitudes and feelings toward other characters {{and the truth}} of the situation. [...] "She doesn't act," [...] said Camille co-star Rex O’Malley; [...] "she lives her roles." [...] Director Clarence Brown, who made seven of Garbo's pictures, told an interviewer [...] "Garbo has something behind the eyes that you couldn't see until you photographed it in close-up. You could see thought. If she had to look at one person with jealousy, and another with love, she didn't have to change her expression. You could see it in her eyes as she looked from one to the other. And nobody else has <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> on screen." [...] Director George Sidney adds [...] "You could call it underplaying but in underplaying she overplayed everyone else." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{have said}} before that Dr Grantly was the working {{man of the}} diocese, and that his father the bishop was {{somewhat}} inclined to an idle life. So it was; but the bishop, though {{he had never been}} an active man, was one whose qualities had rendered him dear to all who knew him. He was the very opposite to his son; he was a bland and a kind old man, opposed by every feeling to authoritative demonstrations and episcopal ostentation. It was perhaps well for him, in his situation, that his son had early in life <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> which he could not well do when he was younger, and which he could not have done at all now that he was over seventy. The bishop knew how to entertain the clergy of his diocese, to talk easy small-talk with the rectors' wives, and put curates at their ease; but it required the strong hand of the archdeacon to deal with such as were refractory either in their doctrines or their lives.|$|E
60|$|The godly all {{hold the}} head, for there Antichrist could never divide them; their {{divisions}} therefore are, as I said, only about smaller things. I {{do not say}} that the antichristian darkness has done nothing in the church as to the hurting it in the great things of God. But, I say, it has not <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> which could sever their Head from them, otherwise there appears even {{too much of the}} effect of his doings there. For even, as to the offices of our Lord, some will have his authority more large, some more strait. Some confine his rules to themselves and to their more outward qualification, and some believe they are extended further. Some will have his power in his church purely spiritual, others again would have it mixed. Some count his Word perfect and sufficient to guide in all religious matters, others again hold that an addition of something human is necessary. Some are for confining of his benefits, in the saving effects of them, only to the elect, others are for a stretching of them further. I might here multiply things, but that light against light is now among the godly as light against light was in the house of the forest of Lebanon, is not at all to be questioned.|$|E
