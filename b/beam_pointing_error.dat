This system can map reliably a 20 km swath of seafloor in 4000 m water depth with 191 soundings per ping. Such a wide swath width demands highly accurate (3 ̆c 0. 052 ̆ 7 RMS) roll {{information from a}} motion sensor, and makes estimating sounding accuracy across the swath an interesting challenge.

Due to the dynamic nature of the sea environments, the ship-borne phased array radar {{must be able to}} compensate for the ship’s motion adaptively. In this paper, the adaptive α-β-γ filter is proposed for the ship-borne phased array radar to compensate for the <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> and to track the air target. The genetic algorithm (GA) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods are applied to estimate the gain parameters of adaptive α-β-γ filters, while achieving the optimum objective of minimum root mean square error (RMSE).

There are many sources for phase errors: local oscillators and clocks, quadrature modulators and demodulators, non-linear components, and so forth. Additionally, phased arrays are sensitive to element mislocation, which introduces another source of phase error. In this research, three types of phase errors were studied: phase noise, gain unbalance in quadrature modulators and demodulators, and element mislocation. Modifications to the traditional array pattern expression were proposed to account for these errors, and equations were programmed in MATLAB to perform parametric simulations to generate information regarding gain loss, <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>error,</b> pattern distortions, and degradation in sidelobe levels.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{performance of a}} phased array antenna depends upon the phase and amplitude distribution across the aperture. A continuous 13 -near phase distribution is required for an efficient focussed beam, but practical phase shifters are digital devices and can only provide an approximation to a linear phase distribution. Consequently some type of roundoff criteria must be established. The method of roundoff affects the radiation pattern characteristics such as beam location and sidelobe level. Accurate target tracking requires that a radar have a small <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>error.</b> Low sidelobes are also desirable to prevent jamming and the illumination of clutter. Therefore {{the goal was to}} select a roundoff criterion that provides a phase distribution across the aperture to minimize both the beam shift and the sidelobe levels, while simultaneously maximizing the gain.

It is considered as a key technology for the fifth generation wireless networks and is already used in wireless LAN (e. g., IEEE 802. 11 ad). Using mmWave for vehicular communications, however, is often viewed with some skepticism due to a misconception that the Doppler spread would become too large at these high frequencies. This is not true when directional beam is employed for communications. In this paper, closed form expressions relating the channel coherence time and beamwidth are derived.

To investigate the mobility effect on the beam alignment which is an important feature in mmWave systems, a novel concept of beam coherence time is defined. The beam coherence time, which is an effective measure of beam alignment frequency, is shown to be much larger than the conventional channel coherence time and thus results in reduced beam alignment overhead. Using the derived correlation function, the channel coherence time, and the beam coherence time, an overall performance metric considering both the channel time-variation and the beam alignment overhead is derived. Using this metric, it is shown that beam alignment in every beam coherence time performs better than the beam alignment in every channel coherence time due to the large overhead for the latter case...|$|R

The parallel increase in computational power has naturally lead {{to the adoption of}} more sophisticated statistical techniques for data analysis in these fields, and in particular, Bayesian methods. As the next generation of instruments comes online, this trend should be continued since previously ignored effects must be considered rigorously in order to avoid biases and incorrect scientific conclusions being drawn from the ever-improving data. In the context of supernova cosmology, an example of this is the challenge from contamination as supernova datasets will become too large to spectroscopically confirm the types of all objects. The technique known as BEAMS (Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species) handles this contamination with a fully Bayesian mixture model approach, which allows unbiased estimates of the cosmological parameters. Here, we extend the original BEAMS formalism to deal with correlated systematics in supernovae data, which we test extensively on thousands of simulated datasets using numerical marginalization and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling over the unknown type of the supernova, showing that it recovers unbiased cosmological parameters with good coverage. We then apply Bayesian statistics to the field of radio interferometry. This is particularly relevant in light of the SKA telescope, where the data will be of such high quantity and quality that current techniques will not be adequate to fully exploit it. We show that the current approach to deconvolution of radio interferometric data is susceptible to biases induced by ignored and unknown instrumental effects such as <b>pointing</b> <b>errors,</b> which in general are correlated with the science parameters. We develop an alternative approach - Bayesian Inference for Radio Observations (BIRO) - which is able to determine the joint posterior for all scientific and instrumental parameters.

The table consists of three axis rotations of the alidade {{as a function of the}} azimuth position. The article also presents the equations to determine the elevation and cross-elevation errors of the antenna as a function of the alidade rotations and the antenna azimuth and elevation positions. The table performance was verified using radio <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> data. The <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> decreased from 4. 5 mdeg to 1. 4 mdeg in elevation and from 14. 5 mdeg to 3. 1 mdeg in cross-elevation. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Geolocation and {{pointing}} accuracy {{analyses of the}} WindSat flight data are presented. The two topics were inter-twined in the flight data analysis and will be addressed to-gether. WindSat has no unusual geolocation requirements rel-ative to other sensors, but its <b>beam</b> <b>pointing</b> knowledge accuracy is especially critical to support accurate polarimetric radiometry. Pointing accuracy was improved and verified using geolocation analysis in conjunction with scan bias analysis. Two methods were needed to properly identify and differentiate between data time tagging and <b>pointing</b> knowledge <b>errors.</b> Matchups comparing coastlines indicated in imagery data with their known geographic locations were used to identify geolocation errors. These coast-line matchups showed possible <b>pointing</b> <b>errors</b> with ambiguities as to the true source of the errors. Scan bias analysis of, the third Stokes parameter, and of vertical and horizontal polariza-tions provided measurement of pointing offsets resolving ambi-guities in the coastline matchup analysis. Several geolocation {{and pointing}} bias sources were incrementally eliminated resulting in pointing knowledge and geolocation accuracy that met all design requirements. Index Terms—Geolocation, polarimetry, radiometry. I...|$|R

The application of HK distribution in modeling atmospheric turbulence channel {{under the influence}} of strong and weak turbulences and all irradiance fluctuations are discussed. Expression for atmospherics turbulence channel model, <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> models and path loss are given. Probability density functions (PDF) for both <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> models (zero boresight and nonzero boresight) are calculated and graphically represented. Also, average bit-error-rate (BER) for zero boresight <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> and nonzero boresight <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> are calculated and graphically represented. Closed form expression for PDF and BER are given. Impact of zero boresight <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> and nonzero boresight <b>pointing</b> <b>error</b> on transmission over atmospheric turbulence channel in FSO system is explained...|$|R
