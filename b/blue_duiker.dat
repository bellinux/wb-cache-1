The reserve was established in 1932. As of 2000, it covered 160,000 hectares (400,000 acres). Cameroon designated the reserve as {{a wildlife}} park for scientific purposes in 1971, Lake Tissongo, a lagoon connected to the south bank of the Sanaga river by a 5 kilometres (3.1mi) tidal channel, is included in the reserve. 80% of the reserve is covered by tropical lowland equatorial forest, and 15% by Atlantic mangrove forests. Fauna include forest elephants, primates (chimpanzees, monkey species such as black colobus), antelopes (sitatunga, <b>blue</b> <b>duiker,</b> etc.), West African manatees, sea turtles, dolphins, crocodiles, alligator, many fish species, terrestrial and water bird species. The red-capped mangabey was reported to be common in the reserve in 1972. The endangered red-eared nose-spotted guenon was reported in the Lombé part of the reserve in densities of 2-3 groups per square kilometers, but populations had dropped elsewhere due to hunting.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, both {{depletion}} of wild animals and declining food supply have threatened the livelihoods of people inhabiting {{the forests of}} the Congo Basin, and rendered the bushmeat trade a national and global concern. Because initial approaches to wildlife management were criticized for lacking consideration of the customary rights of local people, a variety of projects have been proposed to ensure their active participation in management initiatives. However, unfamiliar with the concepts of conservation ecology, local people have {{found it difficult to}} contribute effectively. This paper proposes an approach to monitor the status of fauna, based on the ratio of <b>blue</b> <b>duikers</b> (Philantomba monticola) to medium-sized duikers (Cephalophus spp.) for the total number of hunting catches (the catch B/M). Analysis of changes in the composition of hunting catches across multiple sites in southeastern Cameroon revealed the following trends: (1) without substantive human intervention, i. e., hunting pressure and forest disturbance, medium-sized duikers were densely distributed while <b>blue</b> <b>duikers</b> were sparse, so that the catch B/M was low; (2) under moderate human intervention, <b>blue</b> <b>duikers</b> became more densely distributed while the original density of medium-sized duikers was maintained, so that the catch B/M increased; (3) with extensive human intervention in specific areas, medium-sized duikers became sparsely distributed while a relatively high density of <b>blue</b> <b>duikers</b> was maintained, so that the catch B/M increased significantly and a mosaic of different compositions of duikers was formed; and (4) with extensive human intervention extending over the specific extensive area, both medium-sized and <b>blue</b> <b>duikers</b> became sparse. It appears that the catch B/M predicts changes in the status of game animals and of the background wild fauna, and is both a sufficiently reliable variable for ecologists and perceptible for local people. Furthermore, this approach has the potential to cultivate a relationship of trust between ecologists and local people, which is indispensable in establishing effective collaborative wildlife management...|$|R

The line transect method (Tsi, 2011) was used for data collection. Results revealed an encounter rate of 12. 8 indexes per km, a density of 2. 56 per km 2 and estimate of 1162 <b>blue</b> <b>duikers</b> in the entire landscape.

40|$|Diversity {{in hunting}} methods has been {{reported}} among the Mbuti net hunters in Ituri in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, among the Baka hunters in southeastern Cameroon, who currently practice snare hunting as their principal method, and among other hunter-gatherers in central African forests. Although forest duikers are the main targets {{of all of these}} hunters, different species of duikers are captured by different methods. <b>Blue</b> <b>duikers</b> (Philantomba monticola) weighing about 4 – 5 kg comprise the majority of the Mbuti's net-hunting harvests, whereas red duikers (in particular, Cephalophus callipygus and C. dorsalis) weighing about 15 – 20 kg are the major catch in Baka snare hunting. The density of duikers in each area is reflected in the rate of captures : the density of <b>blue</b> <b>duikers</b> is higher in the forests used by Mbuti net hunters, and red duikers are more abundant in the Baka area. Thus, {{it is likely that the}} relative abundance of each species is one of the major contributors to the selection of an efficient hunting method. Indeed, non-traditional methods may be selected as a result of adaptation to ecological conditions, the availability of hunting tools, and the changing role of hunting in the livelihoods of hunters. An understanding of the context in which hunting methods are selected is needed to design an effective wildlife management plan that is acceptable to the local people who depend on hunting for their livelihood...|$|R

No statistically signifi cant differences were found in group densities of gregarious species or individual densities of non-gregarious species between the two data sets.

50|$|Carnivores are {{exceptionally}} important prey for martial eagles. Among {{these many}} mongoose {{tend to be}} well represented in their diet. Most mongoose native to savanna tend to be highly social burrowers. Most {{of these types of}} mongoose are also relatively small (probably the second smallest important martial eagle food source after korhaans) and can effectively escape quickly to the safety of their underground home, so the lighter, more nimble male martial eagle is more likely to habitually pursue them. In southern Africa, the 0.72 kg meerkat (Suricata suricatta) comprises up to at least 9.6% of prey remains (as in the Cape Province) and the 0.75 kg Cape grey mongoose (Galerella pulverulenta) comprising an average of 7.2% of prey remains in the Cape area. The largest of the social savanna-dwelling mongoose is the banded mongoose at 2.12 kg. Despite often being successful in capturing banded mongoose, in one case when a (presumably inexperienced) immature martial eagle took one to a tree, the dominant male banded mongoose of the group scaled the tree and pulled away from the eagle the still-living mongoose prey to safety. The martial eagle is a known predator of the full size range of mongoose species, from the smallest species, the 0.27 kg common dwarf mongoose (Helogale parvula), to the largest, the 3.38 kg white-tailed mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda). Other moderate-sized carnivores known to fall prey to martial eagles include 0.83 kg striped polecat (Ictonyx striatus) and a few species of genet, which are about twice as heavy on average as the polecat. The martial eagle, however, can be a surprisingly effective predator of carnivorans close to their own size or larger. In the Cape Province, 72 bat-eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis), which average about 4.1 kg, were found in the prey remains, 85% of which were adults. Other foxes have also been hunted, as well as both black-backed (Canis mesomelas) and golden jackals (Canis aureus). Some of the black-backed jackals that martial eagles have captured and flown off with have included “half-grown” individuals and a rare adult, averaging some 8.9 kg, may also be killed but is usually grounded prey. Despite being marginally the smallest of the 3 jackals, the black-backed is the most aggressive and predatory species, so are probably taken only in surprise blitzes. Adult domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) of up to a modest size may occasionally be killed by martial eagles. Martial eagles are also known to opportunistically grab pups of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) as they emerge from their dens. A similarly impressive range of felids have been included in their prey spectrum. Adults of both domestic cats and their ancestors, the 4.65 kg African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica), are known to fall prey to this species. Arguably their most impressive mammalian carnivore prey though are adults of much larger cat species such as the 10.1 kg serval (Leptailurus serval) and even the 12.7 kg caracal (Caracal caracal). Apparent predatory attacks are even attempted on big cat cubs as they are considered potential predators of lion and leopard (Panthera pardus) cubs and confirmed predators of cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) cubs. Evidence shows, however, they rapidly abandon hunting attempts if the formidable mother lion or leopard are present. Successful predatory attacks on other relatively large carnivores have included adults of the 12.4 kg African civet (Civettictis civetta) and the 8.16 kg aardwolf (Proteles cristata).While large accipitrids from around the world are credited with attacks on (almost always young) ungulates, perhaps no other species is as accomplished in this regard as this martial eagle. Over 30 species of ungulate have been identified as prey for this species, more species than are attributed to the perhaps more powerful crowned eagles and all the world’s golden eagles, although in all 3 seldom more than 30% of the diet are comprised by ungulates in a given region. In Kruger National Park, the martial eagle is mentioned as the only bird considered as a major predator of ungulate species. A majority of the ungulate diet of martial eagles are comprised by small antelope species or the young of larger antelopes. Locally favored prey are the dik-diks, one of the smallest kind of antelope, and every known species may be vulnerable to this eagle. In Tsavo East National Park, Kirk's dik-dik (Madoqua kirkii) were the second most numerous prey species and it was estimated that at least 86 dik-diks are taken in the park {{over the course of the}} year by two pairs of martial eagles. At an average of 5 kg, these can provide a very fulfilling meal for an eagle family. Adults of other smaller antelope such as 4.95 kg suni (Neotragus moschatus) and 4.93 kg <b>blue</b> <b>duikers</b> (Philantomba monticola) are probably also taken with relative ease. In general, the young of other antelope are usually attacked, including newborns. Occasional ambush attacks or successful predations are reported on adults of much larger species despite young ones being rather more vulnerable, including 12.1 kg klipspringers (Oreotragus oreotragus), 11.1 kg steenboks (Raphicerus campestris), both species of grysbok (7.6 to 10.6 kg on average), 14.6 kg oribis (Ourebia ourebi) and perhaps up to half a dozen larger duikers, potentially weighing from 7.7 to 25 kg. One duiker dispatched via strangulation weighed an estimated 37 kg, the largest known raptorial kill for any species on the African continent. Among extant birds of prey, only wedge-tailed eagles, reportedly capable of killing sheep and female red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) weighing up to 50 kg, and golden eagles, credited with taking adult female deer of several species with weights estimated at 50 to 70 kg and capable of apparently dispatching domestic calves weighing up to 114 kg, have larger kills attributed to them. Calves, including neonatal young, of the following antelope may also be included in their prey spectrum: impala (Aepyceros melampus), hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus), common tsessebe (Damaliscus lunatus), springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis), Eudorcas gazelles, gerenuk (Litocranius walleri), bushbuck (Tragelaphus sylvaticus), grey rhebok (Pelea capreolus), kob (Kobus kob) and mountain reedbuck (Redunca arundinum). These species can vary in weight from 2.6 kg (i.e. gazelles) to 11 kg (i.e. tsessebe) in newborns. For the newborn impala, weighing already 5.55 kg, the martial eagle is the only bird considered to be a significant predator. Additionally, piglets of warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) (of which only the martial eagle among accipitrids is similarly mentioned as a significant predator) and bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) are taken.|$|R
