Fontaine convinces Nog that the bar is in trouble and he needs some help with the accounts; the Ferengi uses his <b>business</b> <b>knowledge</b> to help the hologram. Fontaine befriends Nog and after a while tries to convince him to return to the outside world following prompting by Ezri. Nog refuses to leave, resulting in Fontaine shutting down his program and refusing to let it restart. Fontaine appears to Nog in an otherwise empty holosuite, and Nog confesses that his injury has made him fear death and the ongoing war with the Dominion. Fontaine counsels Nog, who feels strong enough to leave the holosuite and return to duty. Shortly after he resumes his role back on the station, Nog returns to Fontaine to inform him that he has convinced Quark to leave the program running continuously to allow Vic to have a life of his own.|$|E
25|$|Candidate Reviews: Despite {{her having}} the weakest {{track record of}} the final four and her unwillingness to admit ever being wrong about anything, the interviewers {{unanimously}} considered Saira {{to be the most}} impressive of the candidates, giving her much praise for her prior accomplishments and salesmanship, and even feeling that her abrasiveness could be a strength in the right circumstances. The interviewers noted that while James was, on paper, the strongest of the four candidates, they found him unconvincing in the interviews and questioned whether his heart was in the process. Meanwhile, Tim was commended for his passion, determination and <b>business</b> <b>knowledge,</b> but the interviewers considered him to be naive and were concerned that stepping up to run one of Sir Alan's businesses would be a step too far, while Paul was deemed the weakest of the candidates, mostly due to his short temper and background in businesses that had very little relation to anything Sir Alan did.|$|E

500|$|Magic Johnson had an {{extremely}} {{close relationship with}} Lakers owner Jerry Buss, whom he saw as a mentor and a father figure. Calling Buss his [...] "second father" [...] and [...] "one of [...] best friends", Johnson spent five hours visiting Buss at the hospital {{just a few months}} before his death from cancer. Speaking to media just hours after Buss had died, Johnson was emotional, saying, [...] "Without Dr. Jerry Buss, there is no Magic." [...] Buss acquired the team from Jack Kent Cooke in 1979, shortly before he drafted Johnson with the #1 pick in the 1979 NBA draft. In addition to playing 13 seasons for the Lakers and coaching the team briefly in 1994, Johnson also had an ownership stake in the team for nearly twenty years. Buss took a special interest in Johnson, introducing him to important Los Angeles business contacts and showing him how the Lakers organization was run, before eventually selling Johnson a stake in the team in 1994. Johnson credits Buss with giving him the <b>business</b> <b>knowledge</b> that enabled him to become part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers.|$|E
500|$|Willy Loman is {{an aging}} {{suburban}} Brooklyn, New York salesman whose less than spectacular career {{is on the}} decline. He has lost the youthful verve of his past and his camaraderie has faded away. His <b>business</b> <b>knowledge</b> is still at its peak, but without his youth and heartiness, {{he is no longer}} able to leverage his personality to get by. [...] Time has caught up with him. The play presents Loman's struggle [...] "to maintain a foothold in the upward-striving American middle class" [...] while combating his own self-doubt that plagues him in reminders from the past that his life rests on unsolid ground. According to Charles Isherwood, Loman is the play's dominant character because [...] "It is his losing battle against spiritual and economic defeat that provides the narrative spine of the play." [...] Loman is a symbolic representation of millions of white collar employees who outlived their corporate usefulness. He lives in a world with delusions about how popular, famous, influential and successful he is and about the prospects for the success of his sons. His wife not only allows these delusions, but also she buys into them, somewhat. His misplaced values of importance and popularity were shaken to the core by his declining ability to leverage those self-perceived traits successfully as he grew older.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Wharton, {{a native}} Philadelphian, {{was a leader}} in {{industrial}} metallurgy who built his fortune through the American Nickel Company and Bethlehem Steel Corporation. As Wharton's business grew, he recognized that <b>business</b> <b>knowledge</b> in the United States was only taught through an apprenticeship system, and such a system was not viable for creating a wider economy during the Industrial Revolution. After two years of planning, Wharton in 1881 founded the Wharton School of Finance and Economy through a $100,000 initial pledge, making it the first business school established in the United States. (ESCP Europe, established in 1819, {{and a few other}} business schools were established in Europe prior to Wharton's founding.) The school was meant to train future leaders to conduct corporations and public organizations in a rapidly evolving industrial era. Wharton was quoted as saying that the school was meant to [...] "instill a sense of the coming strife : of the immense swings upward or downward that await the competent or the incompetent soldier in this modern strife".|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, the {{activity}} domain theory is introduced as a theoretical lens for guiding the alignment of <b>business</b> and <b>knowledge</b> strategies. Alignment is focused around {{the activity}} domain, {{which can be}} comprehended as a human workpractice where socially organized actors process a work object into a required outcome. An organization {{is seen as a}} constellation of activity domains, each providing a specific outcome. The products or services provided by the organization are realized by coordinating the domains. The main target for the business strategy is the constellation of activity domains. The target of the knowledge strategy is the knowledge needed to produce the outcome of each domain and the knowledge needed to coordinate the domains. In this way, the activity domain provides a common target for <b>business</b> and <b>knowledge</b> strategies. We argue that this approach makes it possible to operationalize an integrated alignment of <b>business</b> and <b>knowledge</b> strategies...|$|R

But yet, if we will examine it, we shall find it is chiefly, if not only, concerning its ABSTRACT complex ideas. For the natural tendency of the mind being towards knowledge; and finding that, if it should proceed by and dwell upon only particular things, its progress would be very slow, and its work endless; therefore, to shorten its way to knowledge, and make each perception more comprehensive, the first thing it does, {{as the foundation of}} the easier enlarging its knowledge, either by contemplation of the things themselves that it would know, or conference with others about them, is to bind them into bundles, and rank them so into sorts, that what knowledge it gets of any of them it may thereby with assurance extend to all of that sort; and so advance by larger steps in that which is its great <b>business,</b> <b>knowledge.</b> This, as I have elsewhere shown, is the reason why we collect things under comprehensive ideas, with names annexed to them, into genera and species; i.e. into kinds and sorts.|$|E

40|$|Enterprise systems {{implementations}} {{are often}} high cost and high risk with many companies failing {{to achieve their}} targeted business objectives. At the individual level, negative user reactions to enterprise systems lead to resistance to IT use, counter-productive adaptations, and reduced job satisfaction. Factors that contribute to these individual level effects include {{a lack of understanding}} of reengineered business processes and a lack of understanding of economic interdependencies. In this research, a computer-based business simulation educational intervention is investigated to determine its effectiveness in facilitating enterprise systems knowledge acquisition and promoting job satisfaction. Simulation-based education utilizes an experiential learning model, immersing participants in a realistic, dynamic business environment. This dissertation consists of three related essays. Two essays compare simulation-based education against traditional education to determine their relative effectiveness at imparting enterprise <b>business</b> process <b>knowledge</b> (essay 1), <b>business</b> motivational <b>knowledge</b> of economic interdependencies (essay 2), and at influencing job satisfaction. In essays 1 and 2, user knowledge structures are assessed using concept relatedness measures and analyzed using established Pathfinder network structure techniques. Results support the importance of accurate <b>business</b> process <b>knowledge</b> and understanding of enterprise economic interdependencies as antecedents to improved job satisfaction but the two types of knowledge appear to operate differently. <b>Business</b> process <b>knowledge</b> has a relatively stronger effect on perceptions of opportunities and control over the technology; whereas <b>business</b> motivational <b>knowledge</b> resulted in stronger reductions to perceptions of threat relative to a positive influence on opportunity. These influences all led to greater enterprise systems satisfaction among users. Essay 3 investigates salient factors of simulation-based education as an effective transitional intervention for enterprise change management. Based on the organizational behavior concept of realistic job previews, a new concept of realistic technology previews is introduced to IT change management. Simulation education is evaluated for its ability to provide a safe and supportive `transitional space 2 ̆ 7 facilitating IT adaptation by improving IT self-efficacy and improving cognitive appraisals which influence ES job satisfaction. Overall, results of these essays support the importance of user <b>knowledge</b> of <b>business</b> processes and economic relations to improve job satisfaction and adaption to enterprise systems. Simulation-based education is found to be superior to traditional education in imparting <b>business</b> process <b>knowledge.</b> Further, use of simulation-based enterprise systems education is found to positively influence IT self-efficacy and to provide a realistic technology preview, both of which improve cognitive appraisals resulting in higher enterprise systems job satisfaction...|$|R
