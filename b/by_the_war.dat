5|$|Passing through London {{en route}} to Gibraltar, where the Pangloss was based, Worsley met Shackleton, {{recently}} assigned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> Office to the International Contingent destined for Northern Russia to aid the White movement in its fight against the Bolsheviks. Shackleton's expertise in the polar regions had been recognised <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> Office, and with the temporary rank of major, he was preparing the contingent for a winter deployment to Murmansk. Shackleton had already recruited several veterans of the Endurance to serve with him and arranged for Worsley, keen for action, {{to be transferred to}} join the contingent. Worsley, by now a lieutenant commander, left for Murmansk the following month.|$|E

5|$|A {{decision}} {{had recently been}} made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> Office that light tanks were no longer to be generally used in the British Army; on the whole they had performed poorly during the Battle of France and {{were considered to be}} a liability. As a result, the Vickers-Armstrong Light Tank Mk VII Tetrarch light tank was now considered obsolete. This made it available for use by the airborne forces and it was chosen <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> Office as the tank to be transported by glider. However, it had not been designed specifically as an airborne tank or to be airmobile, and it also possessed several faults. Its size limited the possible crew to three—a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret—which was found to be too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, in addition to his own duties, had to act as loader for the 2-pounder, which caused delays in combat; a report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that since the commander had both to fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible. The War Office was also aware that the tank had a faulty cooling system that made the Tetrarch unsuitable for service in hotter climates, such as the Middle East and North Africa.|$|E

5|$|After her naval service {{ended in}} 1919, she was {{returned}} to her original owners and resumed relatively uneventful cargo service over the next twenty years. Early in World War II, the ship was requisitioned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> Shipping Administration, and shipped cargo on New York– Caribbean routes and transatlantic routes.

The remainder of the communities on the southwestern shore urbanized and development connected the area to Houston. Tourism and recreation re-emerged and blossomed particularly around the Clear Lake area and the nearby shoreline.Barrington (2008), p. 266.Antrobus (2005), p. 57.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after the United States entered World War II, Pennsylvanian was requisitioned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> Shipping Administration (WSA), and, as with her pre-U.S. Navy service in World War I, she {{continued}} to be operated by American-Hawaiian. From July to September 1942, Pennsylvanian sailed between New York and Caribbean ports, calling at Trinidad, Key West, Hampton Roads, Guantánamo Bay, and Cristóbal. In January 1943, Pennsylvanian called at Bandar Abbas, Iran, on the Persian Gulf, and returned to Caribbean sailings again by March 1943.|$|E
5|$|Both the St. Louis German and Irish {{communities}} urged neutrality at the 1914 {{outbreak of}} World War I, which {{contributed to a}} resurgent nativism after U.S. entry into the war in 1917. As a result, German St. Louisans suffered some discrimination during the war, and St. Louisans repressed elements of German culture. Commerce was not dramatically affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> However, leading up to and before World War I, the population started to decrease as men were needed {{to work at the}} artillery plants and factories that were closer to the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Culturally speaking, post-Civil War Massachusetts {{ceased to}} be a {{national}} center of idealistic reform movements (such as evangelicalism, temperance and antislavery) as it had been before the war.

5|$|Frederick William {{took over}} Brandenburg-Prussia {{in times of}} a political, {{economical}} and demographic crisis caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Upon his succession, the new elector retired the Brandenburgian army, but had an army raised again in 1643/44. Whether or not Frederick William concluded a truce and neutrality agreement with Sweden is disputed: while a relevant 1641 document exists, it was never ratified and has repeatedly {{been described as a}} falsification. However, it is not disputed that he established the growth of Brandenburg-Prussia.|$|E
