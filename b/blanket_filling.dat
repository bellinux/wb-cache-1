40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the physical properties of craters on asteroid (21) Lutetia, derived from images acquired by OSIRIS, the high-resolution cameras onboard ESA's spacecraft Rosetta. Crater morphology on (21) Lutetia fits very well with the general picture of what was known for previously visited small bodies, with a typical depth to diameter ratio of 0. 12. We discuss here the distribution of this parameter all across the surface, but also region by region, and see how it can vary from one location to another and help to distinguish between different geological units. In a later section of the paper we study in more details Beatica region where a deep ejecta <b>blanket</b> <b>filled</b> most of the craters, and estimate the thickness profile of this ejecta based on our analysis of the d/D. We find a good agreement with existing scaling laws, and use this to constrain the scale of the original event that reshaped the surface around the North pole of the asteroid. Finally, we report on the observations of avalanches in several crater flanks, and the presence of many asymmetrical craters with flow-like features, and discuss the evidence for widespread fine material all over the surface...|$|R
40|$|In {{a series}} of {{previous}} articles (see references) the author offered to cover a city or other important large installations or subregions by a transparent thin film supported by a small additional air overpressure under {{the form of an}} AB Dome. The building of a gigantic inflatable AB Dome over an empty flat surface is not difficult. However, if we want to cover a city, garden, forest or other obstacle course we cannot easily deploy the thin film over building or trees. In this article is suggested a new method which solves this problem. The idea is to design a double film <b>blanket</b> <b>filled</b> by light gas (for example, methane, hydrogen, or helium). Sections of this AB Blanket are lighter then air and fly in atmosphere. They can be made on a flat area (serving as an assembly area) and delivered by dirigible or helicopter to station at altitude over the city. Here they connect to the already assembled AB Blanket subassemblies, cover the city in an AB Dome and protect it from bad weather, chemical, biological and radioactive fallout or particulates. After finish of dome building the light gas can be changed by air. Two projects for Manhattan (NY, USA) and Moscow (Russia) are targets for a sample computation.

60|$|But {{though the}} widow had {{neglected}} much, {{there was one}} part she must not utterly neglect. She came away with the dispersing funeral; but the dead man's mat was left behind upon the grave, and I learned that by set of sun she must return to sleep there. This vigil is imperative. From sundown till the rising of the morning star the Paumotuan must hold his watch above the ashes of his kindred. Many friends, if the dead have been a man of mark, will keep the watchers company; they will be well supplied with coverings against the weather; I believe they bring food, and the rite is persevered in for two weeks. Our poor survivor, if, indeed, she properly survived, had little to cover, and few to sit with her; {{on the night of}} the funeral a strong squall chased her from her place of watch; for days the weather held uncertain and outrageous; and ere seven nights were up she had desisted, and returned to sleep in her low roof. That she should be at the pains of returning for so short a visit to a solitary house, that this borderer of the grave should fear a little wind and a wet <b>blanket,</b> <b>filled</b> me at the time with musings. I could not say she was indifferent; she was so far beyond me in experience that the court of my criticism waived jurisdiction; but I forged excuses, telling myself she had perhaps little to lament, perhaps suffered much, perhaps understood nothing. And lo! in the whole affair there was no question whether of tenderness or piety, and the sturdy return of this old remnant was a mark either of uncommon sense or of uncommon fortitude.|$|R
60|$|To {{avoid being}} {{involved}} in these guerillas, {{as well as to}} escape from the extremely social intercourse of the Crows, which began to be oppressive, Montero moved to the distance of several miles from their camps, and there formed a winter cantonment of huts. He now maintained a vigilant watch at night. Their horses, which were turned loose to graze during the day, under heedful eyes, were brought in at night, and shut up in strong pens, built of large logs of cotton-wood. The snows, during a portion of the winter, were so deep that the poor animals could find but little sustenance. Here and there a tuft of grass would peer above the snow; but they were in general driven to browse the twigs and tender branches of the trees. When they were turned out in the morning, the first moments of freedom from the confinement of the pen were spent in frisking and gambolling. This done, they went soberly and sadly to work, to glean their scanty subsistence for the day. In the meantime the men stripped the bark of the cotton-wood tree for the evening fodder. As the poor horses would return toward night, with sluggish and dispirited air, the moment they saw their owners approaching them with <b>blankets</b> <b>filled</b> with cotton-wood bark, their whole demeanor underwent a change. A universal neighing and capering took place; they would rush forward, smell to the blankets, paw the earth, snort, whinny and prance round with head and tail erect, until the blankets were opened, and the welcome provender spread before them. These evidences of intelligence and gladness were frequently recounted by the trappers as proving the sagacity of the animal.|$|R

40|$|The author, in {{a series}} of {{previous}} articles, designed the “AB Dome” made of transparent thin film supported by a small additional air overpressure for the purpose of covering a city or other important large installations or sub-regions. In present article the author offers a variation in which a damaged nuclear station can be quickly covered by such a cheap inflatable dome. By containing the radioactive dust from the damaged nuclear station, the danger zone is reduced to about 2 km 2 rather than large regions which requires the resettlement of huge masses of people and which stops indus-try in large areas. If there is a big city (as Tokyo) near the nuclear disaster or there is already a dangerous amount of radioactive dust near a city, the city may also be covered by a large inflatable transparent Dome. The building of a gi-gantic inflatable AB Dome over an empty flat surface is not difficult. The cover is spread on a flat surface and a venti-lator (fan system) pumps air under the film cover and lifts the new dome into place but inflation takes many hours. However, to cover a city, garden, forest or other obstacle course in contrast to an empty, mowed field, the thin film cannot be easily deployed over building or trees without risking damage to it by snagging and other complications. This article proposes a new method which solves this problem. The design is a double film <b>blanket</b> <b>filled</b> by light gas such as, methane, hydrogen, or helium - although of these, methane will be the most practical and least likely to leak. Sections of this AB Blanket are lighter than air and will rise in the atmosphere. They can be made on a flat area serving as an as-sembly area and delivered by dirigible or helicopter to station at altitude over the city. Here they connect to the already assembled AB Blanket subassemblies, cover the city in an AB Dome and protect it from bad weather, chemical, bio-logical and radioactive fallout or particulates. After assembly of the dome is completed, the light gas can be replaced by (heavier but cheaper) air.

60|$|Six {{thousand}} {{spent the}} winter of 1897 in Dawson, work on the creeks went on apace, while beyond the passes {{it was reported that}} one hundred thousand more were waiting for the spring. Late one brief afternoon, Daylight, on the benches between French Hill and Skookum Hill, caught a wider vision of things. Beneath him lay the richest part of Eldorado Creek, while up and down Bonanza he could see for miles. It was a scene of a vast devastation. The hills, to their tops, had been shorn of trees, and their naked sides showed signs of goring and perforating that even the mantle of snow could not hide. Beneath him, in every direction were the cabins of men. But not many men were visible. A <b>blanket</b> of smoke <b>filled</b> the valleys and turned the gray day to melancholy twilight. Smoke arose from a thousand holes in the snow, where, deep down on bed-rock, in the frozen muck and gravel, men crept and scratched and dug, and ever built more fires to break the grip of the frost. Here and there, where new shafts were starting, these fires flamed redly. Figures of men crawled out of the holes, or disappeared into them, or, on raised platforms of hand-hewn timber, windlassed the thawed gravel to the surface, where it immediately froze. The wreckage of the spring washing appeared everywhere--piles of sluice-boxes, sections of elevated flumes, huge water-wheels,--all the debris of an army of gold-mad men.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Neonatology is {{a branch}} of {{pediatrics}} that deals with the medical care of newborn infants. Neonatal Encephalopathy is a clinical and not an etiologic term that describes an abnormal non-behavioral state consisting of decreased level of consciousness and usually other signs of brain stem and/or motor dysfunction. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy is a disorder caused due to birth asphyxia. Asphyxia means lack of oxygen. Therapeutic hypothermia {{has been shown to}} decrease the risk of brain injury in newborn. Brain hypothermia, is induced by cooling a baby to around 35 °C for three days after birth. Some of the cooling methods are antipyretics, fans, ice packs, cold fluids, water <b>filled</b> <b>blankets</b> or garments, forced cold air and cool caps. Cool tub is the most prevalent technology. It is a tub designed to cool the brain of neonates with oxygen deprivation during birth in order to prevent brain damage. The cool tub has cooling unit, in which cooling is provided by cool pack placed in it, infant should placed within four hours of birth. The baby was placed in the tub for 72 hours after which the baby’s temperature is slowly raised again over the following four hours. The idea of the cool tub is to cool the brain soon after the injury to stop cell suicide in the brain. The aim of this work is to monitor the temperature of the baby and hence maintain the same by automatically cooling and re-warming the material inside the cap. This process is done using temperature transducer, microcontroller, cooling unit and a warming unit...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{mechanical}} polishing (CMP) of metals {{has emerged as}} a critical process step for the fabrication of advanced integrated circuit devices in the semiconductor industry. In a typical metal CMP process, the metal film is <b>blanket</b> deposited to <b>fill</b> recessed features on a patterned dielectric on silicon. Following metal deposition and gap fill, the metal overabundance is polished away by CMP, leaving an inlayed metal pattern or damascene structure on the substrate. Removal of the metal overabundance also planarizes the wafer surface for subsequent processing steps. The material removal process occurring during CMP is thought to involve the combined action of chemical oxidation and dissolution, and mechanical removal of material by abrasives. However, the relative contribution of mechanical and chemical effects during metal CMP is not well understood. The objective of this research was to characterize the fundamental electrochemical behavior of tungsten and aluminum thin films in polishing chemistries of interest to CMP. It was also of interest {{to determine the extent to}} which electrochemical oxidation and dissolution, or mechanical removal by abrasive action assists in material removal during CMP. A simultaneous electrochemical tester and polishing tool was developed to characterize the electrochemical behavior of tungsten and aluminum during and after abrasion. Small-scale polishing experiments were also carried out to measure polishing (removal) rates of the metals during CMP. Electrochemical dissolution rates and polishing rates were compared. It was found that the electrochemical dissolution rate of tungsten or aluminum during or after abrasion was very small compared to actual polishing rates. However, the presence of an oxidant enhanced polishing rates dramatically. The findings indicate that the mechanism for removal during CMP is primarily corrosion assisted metal removal, and not electrochemical dissolution and/or removal of the oxidation product of the metal...|$|R
40|$|For {{subjects}} stricken by sudden {{cardiac arrest}} outside a medical facility, the overall survival rate approaches 25 % (best scenario case) with advanced life support and only 5 % without. Often survivors face sequelaes such as brain damage. Prior studies {{have revealed that}} resuscitative mild hypothermia (core temperature ranging from 34 °C to 32 °C) can alleviate damage to vital organs, including the brain. Although, the delayed cooling (up to several hours with no blood flow) {{has proven to be}} effective, time is believed to be critical to achieve maximum efficiency. A new cooling device, the Thermosuit™ System (TSS) induces hypothermia rapidly with direct ice-water contact to skin. This cooling means matches high cooling rate, ease-of-use and potential portability. ^ Objectives. The study (1) compares the performance of the TSS with a commercial water <b>filled</b> <b>blanket</b> product: The Gaymar Medi-Therm-III cooling blanket system; (2) examines whether advanced life support procedures such as defibrillation could be administered safely and effectively in water; (3) analyzes and models the body response to the cooling. ^ Methods. Three protocols were followed: (1) a randomized, unblinded, 2 -period, cross-over comparison of the TSS with another non-invasive cooling method on a large swine model. (2) Conventional AED defibrillation shocks applied to animals in induced ventricular fibrillation during a TSS cooling. (3) TSS-induced hypothermia in different configurations. In every protocol, the swine were instrumented with arterial pressure monitoring, ECG and temperature sensors. These values were recorded with PC based laboratory computer systems. ^ Conclusions. TSS cooling was similar to Gaymar Medi-Therm III, with the exception that the overall temperature drop was much quicker. The TSS achieves a 18. 64 °± 13. 66 °C/h rate versus the Gaymar at 4. 61 ± 3. 11 °C/h. Safe and efficient heart defibrillation and pacing are possible while cooling under water with the TSS with no additional safety recommendation. The body response to TSS cooling can be modeled by a 8 th order (RC) low-pass filter. Vasoconstriction is often the only metabolic response established during the TSS cooling process. Induced pre-vasodilation could help improve the cooling rate and the active cooling can be shortened in time if the continuous fall in temperature is accounted for. ...|$|R
