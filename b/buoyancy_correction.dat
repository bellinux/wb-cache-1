5000|$|Major {{advantages}} of gravimetric method include sensitivity, accuracy, {{and the possibility}} of checking the state of activation of an adsorbent sample. However, consideration must be given to <b>buoyancy</b> <b>correction</b> in gravimetric measurement. A counterpart is used for this purpose. The solid sample is placed in a sample holder on one arm of the microbalance while the counterpart is loaded on the other arm. Care must be taken to keep the volume of the sample and the counterpart {{as close as possible to}} reduce the buoyancy effect. The system is vacuumed and the balance is zeroed before starting experiments. Buoyancy is measured by introducing helium and pressurizing up to the highest pressure of the experiment. It is assumed that helium does not adsorb and any weight change (ΔW) is due to buoyancy. Knowing the density of helium (...) , one can determine the difference in volume (ΔV) between the sample and the counterpart: ...|$|E

This approach, besides supplying information on useful material properties, significantly enhances {{the reliability of the}} values of the single measured properties. In fact, the evaluation of the specific volume of molten polymer/gas solutions can be used to accurately account for the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>correction</b> to be applied in both the gravimetric sorption experiment and in the evaluation of interfacial tension.

40|$|Although a {{fundamental}} physical parameter, surface tension {{is difficult to}} measure. Common tensiometry inaccuracy comes from failure to control air–liquid–solid contact conditions, or account for liquid meniscus geometry and <b>buoyancy</b> <b>corrections.</b> This paper describes an in situ tensiometry technique, based on withdrawal of a thin-walled tube from the liquid interface, that enforces a known air–liquid–solid contact condition.

40|$|Data {{from the}} test of a large semispan model was used to perform a direct {{validation}} of a wall interference correction system for a transonic slotted wall wind tunnel. At first, different sets of uncorrected aerodynamic coefficients were generated by physically changing the boundary condition of the test section walls. Then, wall interference corrections were computed and applied to all data points. Finally, an interpolation of the corrected aerodynamic coefficients was performed. This interpolation made sure that the corrected Mach number of a given run would be constant. Overall, the agreement between corresponding interpolated lift, drag, and pitching moment coefficient sets was very good. Buoyancy corrections were also investigated.

40|$|Molar mass {{measurement}} using Dumas method is usually taken {{in high school}} chemistryprogram or general university chemistry one for first-year students. However, the ordinary methodtakes much time and therefore {{it is difficult for}} students to finish it within a limited lesson period. In this paper, the improved Dumas method, which enables them to measure molar mass withrapidity, is proposed and applied for ethanol, 2 -propanol, and ethyl acetate. The main improvementis as follows: First, the RTP constant (=RT/P, R : gas constant, P : atmospheric pressure, T :absolute temperature of boiling water) is used for estimating molar mass directly. Second, thevolume correction is omitted because its contribution to molar mass is negligible. And finally, thebuoyancy parameter (BP) is used for correcting the contribution of buoyancy to sample weight, orthe <b>buoyancy</b> <b>correction</b> is omitted because its weight loss is ca 5 % of sample weight.

40|$|We {{extend the}} idea of {{multiscale}} large-eddy simulation (LES), the underresolved fluid dynamical simulation that is augmented with a physical description of subgrid-scale (SGS) dynamics. Using a vortex-based SGS model, we consider two areas of specialization: active (buoyant) scalar mixing and wall-bounded turbulence. First, we develop a novel method to perform direct numerical simulation (DNS) of statistically stationary buoyancy-driven turbulence by using the fringe-region technique within a triply periodic domain, in which a mixing region is sandwiched between two fringes that supply the flow with unmixed fluids [...] -heavy on top of light. Spectra exhibit small-scale universality, as evidenced by collapse in inner scales. A comparison with high-resolution DNS spectra from Rayleigh [...] Taylor turbulence reveals some similarities. We perform LES of this flow {{to show that a}} passive scalar SGS model can also be used in an unstably stratified environment. LES spectra, including subgrid extensions, show good agreement with DNS data. For stably stratified flows, we develop an active scalar SGS model by performing a perturbation expansion in small Richardson numbers of the passive scalar SGS model to obtain an expression for the SGS scalar flux that contains <b>buoyancy</b> <b>corrections.</b> We then develop a wall model for LES in which the near-wall region is unresolved. A special near-wall SGS model is constructed by averaging the streamwise momentum equation together with an assumption of local [...] inner scaling, giving an ordinary differential equation for the local wall shear stress that is coupled with the LES. An extended form of the stretched-vortex SGS model, which incorporates the production of near-wall Reynolds shear stresses due to the winding of streamwise momentum by near-wall attached SGS vortices, then provides a log relation for the off-wall LES boundary conditions. A Karman-like constant is calculated dynamically as part of the LES. With this closure we perform LES of turbulent channel flow for friction-velocity Reynolds numbers Rey_	au= 2,	extrmk [...] 20,	extrmM. Results, including SGS-extended spectra, compare favorably with DNS at Rey_	au= 2,	extrmk, and maintain an O(1) grid dependence on Rey_	au. Finally, we apply the wall model to LES of long channels to capture effects of large-scale structures. Computed correlations are found to be consistent with recent experiments. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Neutral {{buoyancy}} is {{a condition}} in which a physical body's average density is equal to the density of the fluid in which it is immersed. The buoyancy offsets the force of gravity that would otherwise cause the object to [...] (if the body's density is greater than the density of the fluid in which it is immersed) or rise (if it's less). An object that has neutral buoyancy will neither sink nor rise.In scuba diving, the ability to maintain neutral buoyancy through controlled breathing, accurate weighting, and management of the buoyancy compensator is an important skill. A scuba diver maintains neutral <b>buoyancy</b> by continuous <b>correction,</b> usually by controlled breathing, as neutral buoyancy is an unstable condition for a compressible object in a liquid.|$|R
40|$|Cloud-top {{temperature}} (CTT) is {{an important}} parameter for convective clouds and is usually different from the 11 -micrometers brightness temperature due to non-blackbody effects. This paper presents an algorithm for estimating convective CTT by using simultaneous passive [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ] and active [CloudSat 1 Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) ] measurements of clouds to correct for the non-blackbody effect. To do this, a weighting function of the MODIS 11 -micrometers band is explicitly calculated by feeding cloud hydrometer profiles from CloudSat and CALIPSO retrievals and temperature and humidity profiles based on ECMWF analyses into a radiation transfer model. Among 16 837 tropical deep convective clouds observed by CloudSat in 2008, the averaged effective emission level (EEL) of the 11 -mm channel is located at optical depth; approximately 0. 72, {{with a standard deviation}} of 0. 3. The distance between the EEL and cloud-top height determined by CloudSat is shown to be related to a parameter called cloud-top fuzziness (CTF), defined as the vertical separation between 230 and 10 dBZ of CloudSat radar reflectivity. On the basis of these findings a relationship is then developed between the CTF and the difference between MODIS 11 -micrometers brightness temperature and physical CTT, the latter being the non-blackbody correction of CTT. Correction of the non-blackbody effect of CTT is applied to analyze convective cloud-top <b>buoyancy.</b> With this <b>correction,</b> about 70 % of the convective cores observed by CloudSat in the height range of 6 - 10 km have positive buoyancy near cloud top, meaning clouds are still growing vertically, although their final fate cannot be determined by snapshot observations...|$|R
40|$|In {{calibration}} {{of secondary}} 1 kg stainless steel mass standard from a platinum-iridium kilogram prototype, a major uncertainty {{arises from the}} measurement of air density for the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>correction.</b> This paper is continued to the reference[1].

The environmental measurement instruments used for this experiment are different from those previously used. Also the true mass difference between buoyancy pairs in vacuum was measured at mass laboratory of NMIJ in Japan and compared with the KRISS result. The disagreement between air density measurements by the 1 kg BA-pair and those by CIPM formula is 5. 1 x 10 - 4 kg/m 3, but the standard deviation of the difference between both methods has been improved, to 5. 3 x 10 - 5 kg/m 3 compared to 1. 5 x 10 - 4 kg/m 3 by the previous experiment...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} mass {{is a useful}} concept introduced to reduce {{the impact of the}} <b>buoyancy</b> <b>correction</b> in everyday mass measurements, thus avoiding in most cases its accurate determination, necessary in measurements of ‘true’ mass. Although usage of {{conventional mass}} is universal and standardized, the concept is considered as a sort of second-choice tool, to be avoided in high-accuracy applications. In this paper we show that this is a false belief, by elucidating the role played by covariances between volume and mass and between volume and conventional mass at the various stages of the dissemination chain and in the relationship between the uncertainties of mass and conventional mass. We arrive at somewhat counter-intuitive results: the volume of the transfer standard plays a comparatively minor role in the uncertainty budget of the standard under calibration. In addition, conventional mass is preferable to mass in normal, in-air operation, as its uncertainty is smaller than that of mass, if covariance terms are properly taken into account, and the uncertainty over-stating (typically) resulting from neglecting them is less severe than that (always) occurring with mass. The same considerations hold for force. In this respect, we show that the associated uncertainty is the same using mass or conventional mass, and, again, that the latter is preferable if covariance terms are neglected...|$|E

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of {{nitrous oxide}} (N 2 O) on silica gel {{has been studied}} using a gravimetric apparatus under near critical conditions. In gravimetric measurements, {{the determination of the}} excess amount adsorbed depends on a <b>buoyancy</b> <b>correction</b> factor which accounts for the volumes of the adsorbent and the solid parts in the cell. The accurate measurement of the volume of the sorbent and the metal parts in the measuring cell {{plays an important role in}} the precise measurement of the excess adsorbed amount especially at high densities. To this aim, a new protocol has been proposed which accounts for non-negligible helium adsorption and thermal expansion of the sorbent and the solid parts of the balance. Helium isochores under moderate temperature and densities have been experimentally measured. The adsorption behavior of helium has been characterized using a nonlinear mobile adsorption model. The proposed protocol has then been applied for the measurement of the excess adsorbed amount of supercritical N 2 O on silica gel very close to the critical point. Clear experimental evidence of critical depletion, i. e., the decrease of the excess adsorption along an isochore with decreasing temperature, has been obtained. Unlike the previous observation, where critical depletion was seen only in the direct vicinity of the critical isochore, in the present study this is observed on isochores in the range of 0. 74 to 1. 15...|$|E
