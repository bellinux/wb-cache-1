40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the relationship between personality factors and labour market success. Methodology: The empirical data {{used for this study}} was collected from the SOM (Society, Opinion, Media) -institute’s yearly national survey 2012 containing a structured questionnaire. Theoretical framework: Theories used in the analysis and construction of the theoretical model are; the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> <b>theory,</b> Human Capital Theory and Social Capital Theory. Analysis and conclusion: The result shows that the personality trait most related to income is neuroticism, which was shown to have a negative relation to income. Indicating that neuroticism is negative for career success. Human capital is shown to have a mediating role for personality traits’ relation to income. This study’s result and implications will hopefully be of importance for employers, employees and policymakers in the labour market...|$|E

Dialogue scenes in virtual environments are crucial to narrative progression and user believability, yet they continue to demand heavy authorial burden. In this paper, we describe our project Grapevine, a system for generating gossipstyle conversation. We model the gossip conversation with a series of speech-acts controlled by a dialogue manager. We model characters with traits derived from the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> <b>theory</b> of personality. Grapevine also maintains an independent belief matrix, allowing for modeling of phenomena such as dishonesty, misunderstanding and bias. The dialogue manager decisions are a function of both narrative progression and personality traits. Surface text realization is achieved using RealPro, an off-the-shelf realizer (Lavoie & Rambow, 1997) and stylistically enhanced with the PERSONAGE generator (Mairesse & Walker, 2007).

The growing practical learning domain focuses on students with learning and behavioural disorders and shows {{a lot of problems}} regarding aggression, disturbances and disorders. The research is based on the traditional <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> <b>Theory</b> which contains 5 types of personality. Previous studies only showed a correlation with conscientiousness and agreeableness, but evidence for extraversion, emotional stability and openness remained inconsistent. In total 153 students on 8 schools participated. At extraversion only a correlation with antisocial behaviour was found. Emotional instability showed a relation with almost all forms of external problem behaviour. Openness showed no connection at all. More research has to reveal if external problem behaviour arises from feelings like stress, anxiety and tension. This gives teachers the tools to identify and treat problem students.

40|$|ABSTRACT Multitrait-multimethod {{analyses}} {{were used to}} examine the degree of convergent and discriminant validity of the <b>Big</b> <b>Five.</b> Phase 1 examined self-reports of the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> across three measurement occa-sions. Self-reports of the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> traits were stable, but were moderately intercorrelated. Phase 2 examined assessments of the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> across dif-ferent types of informants (self, peer, and parent). Assessments converged across types of informants and, importantly, {{there was no evidence of}} correlation between the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> traits across the perspectives of different types of informants. The present results suggest that the degree of or-thogonality of the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> traits depends on the source of the data.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a project in}} which an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) attemtps to detect {{the personality of the}} user by asking him (or her) a series of questions. The project uses the Elckerlyc platform, a Behavior Markup Language (BML) compliant behavior realizer for ECAs [1]. BML allows the design and implementation of verbal and nonverbal behaviors in an abstract way, without reference to the ECA model in question. This means the designer only needs to decide “what” kind of behaviors should be performed by the ECA and to specify “when” these behaviors should be performed, without needing to know how the realization engine actually displays these behaviors on the ECA’s embodiment. The aim of this research was to extend the Psychometer [2], a text based dialogue system for personality detection, with a virtual embodiment that uses gaze behavior and facial expressions.

Similar to related work in the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> <b>Theory</b> of Personality, we posit a Big-Two-Factor Theory of academic motivation orientation and evaluate the implicit but largely untested assumption that selected motivation constructs can be represented as higher-order (HO) Performance and Learning factors. We collected test-retest data (multi-item scales designed to measure 8 motivation constructs - Ego, Competition, Mastery, Intrinsic, Cooperation, Individual, Approach Success, and Avoid Failure) from a diverse group (N = 606) of able students in grades 3 - 6 (M age = 9. 7 years). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) provided support {{for each of the}} 8 scales. HO CFA models fit the data reasonably well for each time considered separately and demonstrated well-defined, HO Learning and Performance factors. For the combined T 1 and T 2 data, however, the substantial test-retest correlations for first-order factors were not fully explained by the HO factors. Gender differences in the eight specific scales were captured by the two HO factors, thus supporting Big-Two-Factor Theory...|$|E
40|$|Although {{much debate}} exists {{as to the}} clear {{conceptualisation}} of brand personality, research acknowledges empirical links between the dimensions of brand personality and those purported to measure human personality (in particular, the <b>big</b> <b>five</b> <b>theory).</b> A review of the current literature {{on the topic of}} brand personality recognises that the focus is shifting from simply building brands to more clearly understanding the relationship between brands and the consumer. As such, an opportunity exists to expand the current theoretical framework of brand personality by reassessing the way in which brand personalty is constructed and recognising the potential for this construct to include an Emotional Intelligence based dimension. The importance of recognising the emotional components of brands is evident for specific products and services (for example, health care). Hence, the inclusion of Emotional Intelligence based competencies in future research into brand personality can only enhance the marketability of these brands to consumers and resultant consumer-brand relationships. The research has implications for both brand theorists and brand practitioners with potential emphases on both brand building concepts and analysis of consumer reactions to the brand. In this instance the focus is restricted to reviewing opportunities for brand building enhancement...|$|E

Moreover, no clear answer exists whether similarity in <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> traits and self-esteem predict couple satisfaction. Further, little evidence exists showing whether relationship satisfaction predicts <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> traits and self-esteem. These personality constructs have rarely been studied conjointly and no research is available to give some indication of how family members impact each other in <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> traits and self-esteem (i. e., codevelopment in personality). This cumulative dissertation encloses five studies with the goal to review current research on <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> traits and satisfaction in couples, to test whether <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> traits, self-esteem, and the partners’ similarity in personality predict relationship satisfaction and whether relationships satisfaction predicts later personality. We further examine self-esteem as mediator between <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> traits and relationship satisfaction and perceptual processes as mediators between self-esteem, neuroticism, and relationship satisfaction. We also study <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> traits and self-esteem conjointly to test for their reciprocal association and their possible impact on family members’ personalities. The five studies reveal that (a) neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and self-esteem are especially vital for both partners’ satisfaction, (b) <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> trait and self-esteem similarity does not substantially contribute to satisfaction in addition to both partners’ personality main effects, with the exception of neuroticism and openness, (c) self-esteem and perceptual processes emerged as mediators, (d) <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> traits and self-esteem are associated concurrently and have a bidirectional impact on each other longitudinally, and (e) evidence from studies with adolescent and young adult children suggests little impact of family members’ personalities on their <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> traits and self-esteem. The present dissertation highlights the importance of the conjoint examination of <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> traits and self-esteem and their reciprocity over time.

O Big Five Inventory 10 (BFI- 10) é uma escala de 10 itens (dois a cada fator), que avalia cinco dimensões da personalidade: Extroversão; Amabilidade; Conscienciosidade; Neuroticismo e Abertura a experiências. A adaptação de um instrumento baseado no BFI- 10 foi o propósito do presente estudo, em função da necessidade de um instrumento breve baseado na teoria Big Five para uso em pesquisas no Brasil. Foram entrevistadas 1158 pessoas, 58 % do sexo feminino, com idades entre 14 e 35 anos. À forma {{original}} do instrumento foi acrescentado um item em cada fator para selecionar posteriormente os 10 com melhores resultados. As evidências de validade de construto e os índices de fidedignidade foram aceitáveis. O fator Neuroticismo teve os melhores resultados, enquanto Amabilidade foi o menos representativo. Foram observadas associações entre os fatores e as variáveis sóciodemográficas: gênero, idade e escolaridade. Concluiu-se que a escala baseada no BFI- 10 poderá ser utilizada quando o tempo disponível for muito limitado. Considerando as limitações de uma escala breve, os resultados devem ser interpretados com precaução.

The purpose of this study due to the need for a brief instrument based on <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> <b>Theory</b> for use in research in Brazil. Were interviewed 1158 people, being the majority female (58 %) aged between 14 and 35 years. In the original form of the instrument was added one item in each factor to select later the 10 items with better psychometric qualities. There was evidence of construct validity and the rates of internal consistence were acceptable. At the end of the analysis it was identified that Neuroticism was the factor that demonstrated greater legitimacy, whereas Agreeableness was the less representative. Associations were observed among factors and the sociodemographic variables: gender, age and scholarity. It has been concluded that the adapted BFI- 10 can be used when the time available is very limited. Considering the limitations of a so brief scale, the results should be interpreted cautiously.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{present study was to}} examine the {{relationship}} between Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) and academic achievement. Academic achievement is becoming more important in our increasingly competitive environment. Over the years, personality has been shown to play a large factor in academic achievement. However, while the relationship of academic achievement and personality has been researched using more well-known theories of personality such as the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> <b>theory</b> of personality, little attention has been paid to alternative theories, such as RST. This study proposes a theoretical model with indirect effects of Behavioral Activation System (BAS) and Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) on academic achievement through self-efficacy and goal orientation. Ninety-nine first –year university students participated in an online study in laboratories under the supervision of a researcher. Participants completed r-RST, goal orientation, two academic performance tests (sample test questions), and self-efficacy measures. To elicit change in self-efficacy and academic performance, participants were randomly assigned to either positive or neutral feedback between two performance tests and self-efficacy measures. It was found that while r-BAS had no effect on academic performance, r-BIS was significantly associated with academic performance. Moreover, the indirect effect of r-BIS on academic performance through both mediators was significant. It was also found that feedback moderated the relationship between r-BAS and academic performance, where high-BAS participants in the neutral feedback condition performed worse than low-BIS participants.

40|$|Introduction. Recent {{evidence}} suggests that sexually antagonistic genetic factors in the maternal line promote homosexuality in men and fecundity in female relatives. However, {{it is not clear}} if and how these genetic factors are phenotypically expressed to simultaneously induce homosexuality in men and increased fecundity in their mothers and maternal aunts. Aims. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the phenotypic expression of genetic factors that could explain increased fecundity in the putative females carriers. Methods. Using a questionnaire-based approach, which included also the BFQ personality inventory based on the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> <b>theory,</b> we investigated fecundity in 161 female European subjects and scrutinized possible influences, including physiological, behavioral, and personality factors. We compared 61 female probands who were either mothers or maternal aunts of homosexual men. One hundred females who were mothers or aunts of heterosexual men were used as controls. Main Outcome Measures. Personality traits, retrospective physiological and clinical data, behavior and opinions on fecundity related issues were assessed and analyzed to illustrate possible effects on fecundity between probands and control females. Results. Our analysis showed that both mothers and maternal aunts of homosexual men show increased fecundity compared with corresponding maternal female relatives of heterosexual men. A two-step statistical analysis, which was based on t-tests and multiple logistic regression analysis, showed that mothers and maternal aunts of homosexual men 1) had fewer gynecological disorders, 2) had fewer complicated pregnancies, 3) had less interest in having children, 4) placed less emphasis on romantic love within couples, 5) placed less importance on their social life, 6) showed reduced family stability, 7) were more extraverted, and 8) had divorced or separated from their spouses more frequently...|$|E

The two remaining <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> factors, called Agreeableness and Neuroticism (with the opposite pole of the latter factor being Emotional Stability), are similar to the Agreeableness and Emotionality factors of the HEXACO model - but with some differences in the content of the factors. Agreeableness and Emotionality from the HEXACO model represent rotated variants of their <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> counterparts, for example, characteristics related to a quick temper are associated with Neuroticism or low Emotional Stability in the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> framework, but with low Agreeableness in the HEXACO framework. Therefore, the <b>Big</b> <b>Five's</b> Agreeableness and HEXACO's Agreeableness are not identical.

This model takes five main traits as constitutive of people’s personality: (i) Extraversion (sociable, assertive, playful), (ii) Agreeableness (friendly, cooperative), (iii) Conscientiousness (self-disciplined, organized), (iv) Emotional Stability (calm, unemotional), and (v) Openness to Experience. Over the last 50 years the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> model has become standard in psychology. In our study, <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> personality traits are measured by means of Italian version of the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> Marker Scales (BFMS) questionnaire [55].|$|R

They found that grit was related to conscientiousness more than any other of the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> personality traits. Grit and conscientiousness share variability in their focus on achievement; however, grit is distinct in explaining the unique variability in persevering toward a long-term goal, while conscientiousness is more short-term orientated. Further, grit contributes unique predictive validity over the <b>Big</b> <b>Five.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to levels of trait adjectives which {{are arranged in}} levels subordinate to the <b>Big</b> <b>Five,</b> there are also higher order solutions. In this case higher order solutions refer to combinations of <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> factors which are shown to combine into [...] "meta-traits". John Digman argued that the apparent orthogonality of the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> was {{largely due to the}} nature of the analysis techniques used to derive it rather than any inherent orthogonality.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} {{the usefulness of the}} instinct-conception for personality trait-research. Of particular interest is the effectiveness-connotation of instincts for personality conceptualizations. In its kind, the study forms an indirect test of the so-called psycholexical approach and its main result, the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> personality trait factors. For this, 14, 046 instinct-expressions, collected by Bernard (1924) are taken as the starting-point. This large list of instincts is treated according to psycholexical principles, namely by classifying the most relevant instinct-expressions into the recently developed AB 5 C representation of the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> framework. The classification was performed through both primary and secondary factor pole identifications of each instinct-expression and for each <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> factor. The majority of the personality-relevant instinct terms could be classified in the <b>Big</b> <b>Five</b> system, thus supporting the inclusive potential of the semantics of the <b>Big</b> <b>Five,</b> (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.
