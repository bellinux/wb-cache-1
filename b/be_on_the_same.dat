5|$|An st-{{planar graph}} is a {{connected}} planar graph {{together with a}} bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation that makes it acyclic with a single source and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> face as each other. Such a graph may be made into a strongly connected graph by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the outer face. The dual of this augmented planar graph is itself the augmentation of another st-planar graph.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Against All Odds {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Samoa Joe as Special Outside Enforcer between then-champion Kurt Angle and the {{challenger}} Christian Cage. On January 6, 2008 at TNA's previous PPV event Final Resolution, Angle defeated Cage to retain the championship after Cage's alliance A.J. Styles attacked Cage, aligning with Angle and The Angle Alliance. On the January 10, 2008 episode of Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Cage, Joe, and Styles would compete in a Three Way match on the January 17, 2008 episode of Impact!. Stipulations for the match were that the winner would get a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match against Angle at Against All Odds, however if Styles won he could choose instead of the title match to allow Angle to not have to defend his title for two months. Cage ended up winning the contest, thus becoming the number one contender. On the January 24, 2008 episode of Impact!, Cornette announced that Joe would be the Special Outside Enforcer at Against All Odds due him being controversially disqualified during the match. Also connected to the storyline was the allegiance of former Christian's Coalition and The Angle Alliance member Tomko to either Cage or Angle. Heading up to the match, Tomko explained he was not on either's side, despite being one-half of the TNA World Tag Team Champions with Styles. On the January 31, 2008 episode of Impact!, Tomko defeated Angle after interference from Cage. This resulted in Tomko and Cage seeming to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> page on the February 7, 2008 episode of Impact!.|$|E

25|$|Because of KMT {{strategy}} of having people boycott the referendum, one major controversy, like in 2004 was {{the format of}} the polling, specifically as whether the referendum questions would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> or different ballots as the Presidency. While in 2004 the Central Electoral Commission allowed U shaped line in which people would first cast a ballot for President and then cast a separate ballot for each of the two questions, the Commission ordered voters to cast all votes at once on separate ballots. Voters who choose not to cast a referendum ballot simply declined to pick up the extra two ballots.|$|E
25|$|The 1971 {{plan had}} {{recognized}} the importance of the buildings {{on the north side of}} Main, and historic preservation soon played a larger role in downtown. In 1973 the First Baptist Church became Ossining's first listing on the National Register of Historic Places, and the aqueduct followed the next year. In 1975 the village followed up with a study of the prospects for rehabilitating and preserving downtown that, for the first time in its planning history, drew on community input. It recommended residential development downtown to sustain the businesses that remained, but no new projects were undertaken. A second plan two years later also failed, but made specific recommendations for preserving historic buildings and called for new development to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> scale, rather than the larger structures proposed at the beginning of the decade.|$|E
25|$|General lack of {{distinction}} for independent cities, for practical purposes: Many government agencies, {{as well as}} Philippine society in general, still continue to classify many independent cities outside Metro Manila as part of provinces due to historical and cultural ties, especially if these cities were, and are still, important economic, cultural and social activity centers within the geographic bounds of the provinces to which they previously belonged. Furthermore, most maps of the Philippines showing provincial boundaries almost always never separate independent cities from the provinces {{in which they are}} geographically located, for cartographic convenience. Despite being first-level administrative divisions (on the same level as provinces, as stated in Section 25 of the LGC), independent cities are still treated by many to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> level as municipalities and component cities (second-level administrative divisions) for educational convenience and reduced complexity.|$|E

25|$|In the Dayton Regional, Connecticut prevailed easily. They {{held their}} first three opponents to under 40 points each. While Florida State, in the {{regional}} final, managed to 50, the Huskies scored 90. This set up a game against Baylor in a semifinal game. The Baylor Bears would not go so easily. The Huskies seemed to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> track as prior games, with a 13-point lead at halftime. Kalana Greene scored the first basket of the second half, extending the lead to 15 points. However, Baylor then scored the next twelve points, cutting the lead to three. Connecticut, which had missed eight consecutive shots, began hitting again, and their defense held Baylor without a field goal for over seven minutes. UConn scored 16 points during the stretch and rebuild the lead. UConn {{would go on to}} win the game 70–50, to reach the championship game.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} improvement {{can be made}} with an index. In the example above, initial disk reads narrowed the search range by a factor of two. That can be improved substantially by creating an auxiliary index that contains the first record in each disk block (sometimes called a sparse index). This auxiliary index would be 1% {{of the size of the}} original database, but it can be searched more quickly. Finding an entry in the auxiliary index would tell us which block to search in the main database; after searching the auxiliary index, we would have to search only that one block of the main database—at a cost of one more disk read. The index would hold 10,000 entries, so it would take at most 14 comparisons. Like the main database, the last 6 or so comparisons in the aux index would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> disk block. The index could be searched in about 8 disk reads, and the desired record could be accessed in 9 disk reads.|$|E
