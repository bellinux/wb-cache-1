[...] Following these are the black-and-white promotional scenes from Artpop campaign announcement, the music video for the first single [...] "Applause", the nude images for her interview with V magazine and the artwork for promotional single, [...] "Dope". Gaga shows a range of emotion in the film, including caressing a mannequin and applying dirt on her body, {{but most of the}} time she simply stares towards the camera. Zayda Rivera from New York Daily News expressed her difficulty in understanding the film, but added that [...] "hypnotic musical backdrop of her single 'Artpop' perfectly matches the artsy, bewildering and even disturbing images that run through the fast and slow editing." [...] Gaga admitted that she had performed for 12hours while making the film.|$|E

2500|$|Crawford {{admitted}} the Duncan incident {{was one of}} the biggest regrets of his career, saying [...] "The Duncan thing probably changed my life. It was just—you come to the realization that maybe the way you've been doing things is not the proper way and you have to regroup, not only on the court but off the court.

[...] This, in turn, kept many Jewish tennis players from obtaining the training they needed to compete at the highest levels.|$|E

I put out more projects than the entire Interscope roster from 2008 to 2010, and it took Eminem to come out and trump that, as far as getting physical sales numbers. Interscope had to choose between traditional and the new wave, and I said this new wave costs yall less money and less compromise but it took people on the inside to say to Interscope yall don't know what you're doing with this kid. A lot of the inner workings weren't made clear to me, and I took it very personally". On December 21, 2012 Hamilton released his extended play entitled The Come Down.|$|E
