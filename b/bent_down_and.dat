25|$|An {{example of}} Owen's {{tactical}} mind {{was seen in}} one of his early international matches against England in 1902. Wales were behind in the game with little time remaining when Owen tricked his opposite number, Bernard Oughtred, into an off-side tackle near the English posts. With the Welsh in charge of the scrum on the English '25', Owen told his forwards, in Welsh, to keep hold of the ball, while Owen <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> pretended to collect it. Oughtred came around the scrum to tackle Owen and finding the Welshman empty handed was penalised for being off-side. John Strand-Jones kicked the penalty, allowing Wales to win 9-8.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, he was in Đà Lạt {{when his}} plane had no fuel left, and no pumps were open at the time, so he was marooned there for the night. Fearing a Khánh comeback, the AFC met again and {{unanimously}} resolved to make contingency plans to repel any counter-insurrection by Khánh. Westmoreland sent Colonel Wilson, Khánh's former confidant, to go to the military airport at Đà Lạt to convince the Vietnamese general to resign and allow a new military leadership to take the reins. Khánh finally agreed to leave if he was given a dignified send-off, so the other generals arranged a ceremony at Tan Son Nhut, where military bands serenaded him. He theatrically <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> picked up some loose dirt before putting it in his pocket, saying that he was taking his beloved homeland with him. His enemies, the remaining Vietnamese officers and Taylor, all met him at the airport. He then left as Ambassador-at-Large, and was sent on a world tour, starting with a report at the United Nations in New York City.|$|E
500|$|At around 16:15, Linge ordered SS-Untersturmführer Heinz Krüger and SS-Oberscharführer Werner Schwiedel {{to roll up}} the rug in Hitler's {{study to}} burn it. Schwiedel later stated that upon {{entering}} the study, he saw {{a pool of blood}} the size of a [...] "large dinner plate" [...] by the arm-rest of the sofa. Noticing a spent cartridge case, he <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> picked it up from where it lay on the rug about 1mm from a 7.65 pistol. The two men removed the blood-stained rug, carried it up the stairs and outside to the Chancellery garden. There the rug was placed on the ground and burned.|$|E

500|$|Khánh {{finally agreed}} to leave if {{he was given a}} dignified send-off, so the other generals {{arranged}} a ceremonial farewell at Tan Son Nhut on February 24. Military bands played as he theatrically <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> picked up some loose dirt before putting it in his pocket; Khánh said he was taking his beloved homeland with him, and vowed to one day return. His enemies, the remaining Vietnamese officers, most notably Kỳ and Thi, as well as Taylor, all met him at the airport. The foes managed smiles and handshakes for the media cameras. To make the coup [...] "appear as much as possible the doing of Vietnamese themselves", Taylor had not made any public statement after Khánh’s ouster, on orders from the State Department. Wearing his Grand Cross of the National Order, and carrying two more plastic bags filled with Vietnamese soil, Khánh then left as Ambassador-at-Large, and was sent on a meaningless world tour, starting with a report to the United Nations in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|... 53 Then each of {{them went}} home, 1 while Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2 Early {{in the morning he}} came again to the temple. All the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them. 3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them, 4 they said to him, ‘Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of {{committing}} adultery. 5 Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?’ 6 They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> wrote with his finger on the ground. 7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, ‘Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.’ 8 And once again he <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> wrote on the ground. 9 When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus straightened up and said to her, ‘Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?’ 11 She said, ‘No one, sir.’ And Jesus said, ‘Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the banquet}} had lasted for three days, Urse and Roluo escaped from Uppsala, {{early in the}} morning in {{carriages}} where they had put all the Swedish king's treasure. In order to lessen their burden, and to occupy any pursuing warriors they spread gold in their path (later in the work, this is referred to as [...] "sowing the Fyrisvellir"), although there was a rumour that she only spread gilded copper. When Athislus, who was pursuing the escapers saw that a precious ring was lying on the ground, he bent down to pick it up. Roluo was pleased to see the king of Sweden <b>bent</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> escaped in the ships with his mother.|$|E

60|$|Such compassion, such gentleness, as {{that with}} which she <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> weeping <b>and</b> put her hand upon the mother's might have {{softened}} any mother's heart that ever beat. The woman at first gazed at her in astonishment and then burst into tears.|$|R

60|$|Our friend <b>bent</b> <b>down,</b> crumpling <b>and</b> crumpling at his dog's ears.

60|$|Harry limped forward. His tutor {{placed him}} in a chair; his lips were quivering, his eyes brimming. He laid his crutch on the floor, <b>bent</b> <b>down</b> his head, <b>and</b> wept.|$|R

60|$|She made no movement. I <b>bent</b> low <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{groped for}} her foot under the flounces of the wrapper. She did not {{withdraw}} it and I {{put on the}} shoe, buttoning the instep-strap. It was an inanimate foot. I lowered it gently to the floor.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Coronilla and Medicago species. They {{create a}} slender, {{laterally}} compressed sheath case.

60|$|As he rested, {{his eyes}} roamed around the rocky apartment, and {{presently}} fell upon {{a sheet of}} paper lying under the table.

60|$|I <b>bent</b> my head <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> {{he tried}} to lift his hand to my shoulder. I raised him a little on his pillows, and listened.|$|R
