500|$|The most {{economically}} {{important aspect}} of the geology of the area is the Northampton Sands ironstone formation. This is a marine sand of Jurassic age (<b>Bajocian</b> <b>stage),</b> deposited as part of an estuary sequence and overlain by a sequence of limestones and mudrocks. Significant amounts of the sand have been replaced or displaced by iron minerals giving an average ore grade of around 25 wt% iron. To the west the iron ores have been moderately exploited for a very long time, but their high phosphorus content made them difficult to smelt and produced iron of poor quality until the development of the Bessemer steel making process and the [...] "basic slag" [...] smelting chemistry, which combine to make high quality steelmaking possible from these unprepossessing ores. The Northampton Sands were a strategic resource for the United Kingdom in the run-up to World War II, being the best developed bulk iron producing processes wholly free from dependence on imported materials. However, because the Northampton Sands share in the regional dip of all the sediments of this part of Britain to the east-south-east, they become increasingly difficult to work as one progresses east across the county.|$|E

50|$|Chedworth is of {{interest}} to geologists and biologists. The former railway cuttings especially those adjacent to Fields Road used to show a geological sequence in the <b>Bajocian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Middle Jurassic period (about 180 million years ago) before neglect allowed the site to become cloaked in vegetation. Fossils {{could be found in}} the limestone scree {{at the base of the}} cuttings.|$|E
50|$|The {{base of the}} <b>Bajocian</b> <b>stage</b> {{is defined}} as the place in the stratigraphic column where fossils of the ammonite genus Hyperlioceras first appear. A global {{reference}} profile (a GSSP) for the base is located at Murtinheira, close to Cabo Mondego in Portugal. The top of the Bajocian (the base of the Bathonian) is at the first appearance of ammonite species Parkinsonia convergens.|$|E
50|$|The Otoitidae is {{the ancestral}} {{family of the}} Stephanocerataceae and is known only from a {{relatively}} short interval of time within the <b>Bajocian</b> <b>stage</b> at the beginning the Middle Jurassic and begins with Docidoceras. They gave rise, probably through varieties of Docidoceras to the Stephanoceratidae and Sphaeroceratidae, which in turn {{gave rise to the}} different phylogenetic branches within the Stephacerataceae.|$|E
50|$|Nebulasaurus is an extinct genus of basal eusauropod dinosaur {{known from}} the early Middle Jurassic Zhanghe Formation (Aalenian or <b>Bajocian</b> <b>stage)</b> of Yunnan Province, China. It is known only from the holotype braincase LDRC-v.d.1. A phylogenetic {{analysis}} found Nebulasaurus to be a sister taxon to Spinophorosaurus from the Middle Jurassic of Africa. This discovery is significant paleontologically because it represents a clade of basal eusauropods previously unknown from Asia.|$|E
5000|$|Amygdalodon ( [...] ; [...] "almond tooth" [...] for its almond shaped teeth) was a genus of herbivorous dinosaur {{with a long}} neck. The dinosaur {{itself is}} from the Toarcian to Aalenian or <b>Bajocian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Jurassic (about 170 million years ago), {{and only a few}} bone {{fragments}} and teeth have been discovered. Very little is known about it, but {{it is one of the}} few Jurassic dinosaurs from South America found thus far.|$|E
5000|$|Duriavenator is a genus of {{theropod}} dinosaur {{described in}} 2008 by Roger Benson; its finds were excavated in England. The type species is D. hesperis, {{formerly known as}} Megalosaurus hesperis. Duriavenator lived during the <b>Bajocian</b> <b>stage,</b> around 170 million years ago, {{making it one of}} the oldest-known tetanurans. The genus name combines the Latin name of Dorset, Duria, with Latin for [...] "hunter", venator. This genus has also gone under the unofficial name [...] "Walkersaurus", which is a nomen nudum.|$|E
50|$|The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) {{has defined}} {{the base of}} the <b>Bajocian</b> <b>Stage</b> of the Jurassic as the lowest {{occurrence}} of the genus Hyperlioceras, at 170.3 ± 1.4 million years ago, which defines base of the Hyperlioceras discites Zone. This point also marks the end of the preceding Aalenian Stage. The upper boundary of the Bajocian is indicated by the lowest occurrence of the ammonite Parkinsonia (G.) convergens, at about 167.7 Ma , which defines base of Zigzagiceras zigzag Zone.|$|E
50|$|Mollesaurus {{is known}} from the holotype MOZ 2282 V, {{articulated}} partial skeleton which preserved partial skull {{and most of the}} vertebral column. It was collected in the Chacaico Sur locality from the Emileia giebeli ammonoid zone of the Los Molles Formation, Cuyo Group, dating to the early <b>Bajocian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Middle Jurassic, about 171.6-170 million years ago. Mollesaurus, along with Chacaicosaurus cayi which was found at the same locality, are the only diagnostic ichthyosaur specimens from the Aalenian-Bathonian interval. It was found near Zapala city of the Neuquén Basin.|$|E
5000|$|Allosauroidea is a {{superfamily}} or clade of theropod dinosaurs {{which contains}} four families — the Metriacanthosauridae, Allosauridae, Carcharodontosauridae, and Neovenatoridae. The oldest-known allosauroid, Shidaisaurus jinae, {{appeared in the}} early Middle Jurassic (probably <b>Bajocian</b> <b>stage)</b> of China. The last known definitive surviving {{members of the group}} died out around 93 million years ago in Asia (Shaochilong) and South America (Mapusaurus), though the megaraptorans, including the late-surviving Orkoraptor of the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian stage), may belong to the group as well. Additional, but highly fragmentary, remains probably belonging to carcharodontosaurids have been found from the Campanian-Maastrichtian boundary (70-66 Ma ago) in Brazil. Allosauroids had long, narrow skulls, large orbits, three-fingered hands, and usually had [...] "horns" [...] or ornamental crests on their heads. The most famous and best understood allosauroid is the North American genus Allosaurus.|$|E
