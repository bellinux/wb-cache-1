40|$|Treponema phagedenis Kazan 5 is a {{spirochete}} {{with multiple}} periplasmic flagella attached near {{each end of}} the cell cylinder. Dark-field microscopy revealed that most of the cell is right-handed (helix diameter, 0. 23 micron; helix pitch, 1. 74 microns), and the <b>ends</b> appear <b>bent.</b> These <b>ends</b> could move and gyrate while {{the central part of the}} cell remained stationary. The present study examines the basis for the bent-end characteristic. Motility mutants deficient in periplasmic flagella were found to lack the <b>bent</b> <b>ends,</b> and spontaneous revertants to motility regained the periplasmic flagella and bent-end characteristic. The length of the <b>bent</b> <b>ends</b> (2. 40 microns) was found to be similar to the length of the periplasmic flagella as determined by electron microscopy (2. 50 microns). The helix diameter of the <b>bent</b> <b>ends</b> was 0. 57 micron, and the helix pitch of the <b>bent</b> <b>ends</b> was 1. 85 microns. The periplasmic flagella were short relative to the length of the cells (15 microns) and, in contrast to the reports of others, did not overlap in the center of the cell. Similar results were found with T. phagedenis Reiter. The results taken together indicate that there is a causal relationship between the bent-end morphology and the presence of short periplasmic flagella. We report the first three-dimensional description of spirochete periplasmic flagella. Dark-field microscopy of purified periplasmic flagella revealed that these organelles were left-handed (helix diameter, 0. 36 microns; helix pitch, 1. 26 microns) and only 1 to 2 wavelengths long. Because of a right-handed cell cylinder and left-handed periplasmic flagella along with <b>bent</b> <b>ends</b> having helix diameters greater than those of either the cell cylinder or periplasmic flagella, we conclude that there is a complex interaction of the periplasmic flagella and the cell cylinder to form the <b>bent</b> <b>ends.</b> The results are discussed with respect to a possible mechanism of T. phagedenis motility...|$|R

50|$|It {{consists}} of a Z-shaped tube with open ends, filled with a liquid, and set {{on top of a}} spinning table. If the tube were straight, the liquid would immediately fly out one end or the other of the tube as it began to spin. By bending the ends of the tube back towards the center of rotation, a shift of the liquid away from center will result in the water level in one end of the tube rising and thus increasing the pressure in that end of the tube, and consequently returning the liquid {{to the center of the}} tube. By measuring the rotational speed and the distance from the center of rotation to the liquid level in the <b>bent</b> <b>ends</b> of the tube, the pressure reduction inside the tube can be calculated.|$|R

40|$|A simple {{depth gauge}} has been {{designed}} to ensure, easily and quickly, the proper length of screws in bone surgery. The instrument of this type most often seen in general use consists of a slim steel bar with a hook or right angle on the distal end. Upon this rod is mounted a sliding metal collar with a set screw to fix it firmly to the rod at the desired place. This device has certain drawbacks, the most important of which is that the set screw must be screwed in firmly or not at all. When the instrument has been passed through the screw hole, the <b>bent</b> <b>end</b> engaged in the opposite cortex, and the sliding collar pushed against the proximal cortex, the set screw must be engaged firmly. This C manoeuvre often prevents the dis- (i,) engagement of the instrument and its withdrawal from the drill hole. FIG. 1 It is necessary then to loosen the set screw, and an error is introduced when the sliding collar backs away from the bone. The instrument described here (Fig. 1) is designed to overcome these difficulties. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Cell {{delivery}} via the retrograde coronary route boasts less vessel embolism, myocardial injury, and arrhythmogenicity {{when compared}} with those via antegrade coronary administration or myocardial injection. However, conventional insertion into the coronary sinus and consequent bleeding complication prevent its application in small animals. To overcome the complication of bleeding, we described a modified coronary retroinfusion technique via the jugular vein route in rats with myocardial infarction (MI). A flexible wire with a <b>bent</b> <b>end</b> was inserted into the left internal jugular vein and advanced slowly along the left superior vena cava. Under direct vision, the wire was run into the left cardiac vein by rotating the wire and changing the position of its tip. A fine tube was then advanced along the wire to the left cardiac vein. This modified technique showed less lethal hemorrhage than the conventional technique. Retroinfusion via transjugular catheter enabled efficient fluid or cell dissemination to the majority areas of the free wall of the left ventricle, covering the infarcted anterior wall. In conclusion, transjugular cardiac vein catheterization may make retrocoronary infusion a more safe and practical route for delivering cell, drug, and gene therapy into the infarcted myocardium of rats...|$|E
40|$|An {{optical fibre}} {{is made by}} stretching, or `drawing', a glass or polymer preform in a drawing tower. Extrusion through dies has {{received}} much recent attention as a suitable method for manufacture of preforms of complex shape and novel material composition. However, the preforms are subject to bending during extrusion, so that the final preform has a <b>bent</b> <b>end</b> that must be removed to yield a straight preform {{to be drawn into}} a fibre. Control of bending is needed to improve the efficiency of preform extrusion and reduce wastage of high-cost material. Bending occurs even for simple axisymmetric die geometries {{and in the absence of}} heating. Hence, we here examine asymmetry in the applied pressure as a cause of bending. Assuming a linear stress profile, and using a quasi-static approach, we determine the relationship between the magnitude of asymmetry and the amount of bend of the preform, for preforms with circular or annular cross section. We show that significant bend may be caused by an asymmetry that is small relative to the applied pressure. A simple idea for controlling bending is also suggested. Undergraduate university level mathematics is used in the analysis, making this a useful educational illustration of the role of mathematics in understanding engineering problems. Y. M. Stoke...|$|E

Fiber reinforcement led {{to an increase in}} the strength of concrete at compression by 1, 35 times and an increase in the tensile strength at bending by 3, 4 times. At the second stage, the creep of fibrous concrete and plain concrete of similar composition at different stress levels was researched. Creep curves are plotted.
