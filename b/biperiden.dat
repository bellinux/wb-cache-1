50|$|Treatment {{measures}} have been described. Treatment is typically with the antidotes, atropine and pralidoxime. Atropine, an antagonist to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, is given to treat the physiological symptoms of poisoning. Since muscular response to acetylcholine is mediated through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, atropine does not counteract the muscular symptoms. Pralidoxime can regenerate cholinesterases if administered within approximately five hours. <b>Biperiden,</b> a synthetic acetylcholine antagonist, has been suggested {{as an alternative to}} atropine due to its better blood-brain barrier penetration and higher efficacy.|$|E
50|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of delirium is {{not well}} understood {{and a lack of}} animal models that are relevant to the syndrome has left many key questions in delirium pathophysiology unanswered. Earliest rodent models of delirium used an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, atropine, to induce cognitive and EEG changes similar to delirium. Similar anticholinergic drugs such as <b>biperiden</b> and scopolamine have also produced delirium-like effects. These models, along with clinical studies of drugs with ‘anticholinergic activity’ have contributed to a hypocholinergic theory of delirium.|$|E
50|$|Sulpiride has a {{relatively}} low order of acute toxicity. Substantial amounts may cause severe but reversible dystonic crises with torticollis, protrusion of the tongue, and/or trismus. In some cases all the classical symptoms typical of severe Parkinson's disease may be noted; in others, over-sedation/coma may occur. The treatment is largely symptomatic. Some or all extrapyramidal reactions may respond to the application of anticholinergic drugs such as <b>biperiden</b> or benzatropine. All patients should be closely monitored for signs of long QT syndrome and severe arrhythmias.|$|E
50|$|<b>Biperiden</b> mimics an {{atropine}} intoxication with mydriasis, dryness of mucous membranes, red face, atonic {{states of}} bowels and bladder, and hyperthermia in high doses. Central consequences are agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. An untreated overdose may be fatal, particular in children. Premortal signs are respiratory depression and cardiac arrest. A specific antagonist is physostigmine which combines a peripheral and a central action. Carbachol {{can be used}} to treat atonic bowels and bladder. The vital functions should be monitored and stabilized. It may be necessary to treat hyperthermia with cooling blankets.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} no {{clinical}} trials to show that any psychological or pharmacological intervention is effective in preventing sleepwalking episodes. Despite this, {{a wide range of}} treatments have been used with sleepwalkers. Psychological interventions have included psychoanalysis, hypnosis, scheduled or anticipatory waking, assertion training, relaxation training, managing aggressive feelings, sleep hygiene, classical conditioning (including electric shock), and play therapy. Pharmacological treatments have included an anticholinergic (<b>biperiden),</b> antiepileptics (carbamazepine, valproate), an antipsychotic (quetiapine), benzodiazepines (clonazepam, diazepam, flurazepam, imipramine, and triazolam), melatonin, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (paroxetine), a barbiturate (sodium amytal) and herbs.|$|E
50|$|Atropine {{and related}} {{anticholinergic}} drugs act as antidotes to nerve agent poisoning because they block acetylcholine receptors, {{but they are}} poisonous in their own right. (Some synthetic anticholinergics, such as <b>biperiden,</b> may counteract the central symptoms of nerve agent poisoning better than atropine, since they pass the blood-brain barrier better than atropine.) While these drugs will {{save the life of}} a person affected with nerve agents, that person may be incapacitated briefly or for an extended period, depending on the amount of exposure. The endpoint of atropine administration is the clearing of bronchial secretions. Atropine for field use by military personnel is often loaded in an autoinjector, for ease of use in stressful conditions.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion When <b>biperiden</b> {{administration}} {{is required by}} intravenous route in children of 5  y-o and less, <b>biperiden</b> should be administered intravenously and titred using bolus dose of 0.5  mg till the therapeutic effect is obtained.|$|E
30|$|Discussion The {{bioavailability}} of <b>biperiden</b> by {{the oral}} route {{is equal to}} 33 %. Accordingly, the corresponding intravenous dose should be divided by a factor three. Dosage regimen of anticholinergic drugs in children are poorly documented. The dosage regimen recommended by the pharmacopea resulted in frequent and severe ADR. Titration of <b>biperiden</b> resulted in efficient and safe dosage.|$|E
30|$|Results There was no {{pediatric}} {{preparation of}} <b>biperiden.</b> Accordingly, the adult preparation {{was used in}} children. The preparation contained 5  mg of <b>biperiden</b> in one milliter of solvent. The initial planned dose for children of 1  y-o and less and those up to 5  y-o were 1 and 2  mg, respectively. The 5  mg (1  ml) of <b>biperiden</b> was diluted in 4  ml of saline resulting in a final dilution of 1  mg/ml. Six children were treated according this dosage regimen. However, the one 1  mg dose was either of limited efficacy while being associated in others of signs suggestive of ADR, including agitation, heart rate greater than 160  b/min, the upper limit for children aged of 1  y-o and less. Two children greater than 1  y-o presented severe abnormal behavior resulting in an attempt at escape. Owing to question about safety, the dosage regimen was changed, as follows: 5  mg (1  ml) of <b>biperiden</b> was diluted with 9  ml of saline resulting in a final dilution of 0.5  mg/ml. An initial dose of 0.5  mg was administered intravenously as a bolus dose. The effects were looked for over 15  min. In the absence of improvement in facial dystonia, a second bolus dose of 0.5  mg was administered, a third dose could be considered 15  min later if the FTDS did not resume. The cumulative initial dose should not be greater than 2  mg. In addition to the reversal of facial dystonia, the therapeutic effect of <b>biperiden</b> included the return of swallowing to normal allowing to give further doses of <b>biperiden</b> by the oral route for three days. The first oral dose was administered no less than 12  h after the last initial dose at a dose equal to the efficient initial cumulative dose. The following doses were halved every 12  h. No ADR related to <b>biperiden</b> were reported using this dosage regimen. The mean duration of hospitalisation was 3.4  ±  0.8  days.|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE: Suppression of {{redundant}} auditory {{information and}} facilitation of deviant, novel, or salient sounds {{can be assessed}} with paired-click and oddball tasks, respectively. Electrophysiological correlates of perturbed auditory processing found in these paradigms {{are likely to be}} a trait marker or candidate endophenotype for schizophrenia. OBJECTIVE: This is the first study to investigate the effects of the muscarinic M 1 antagonist <b>biperiden</b> and the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine on auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs), sensory gating, and mismatch negativity (MMN) in young, healthy volunteers. RESULTS: <b>Biperiden</b> increased P 50 amplitude and prolonged N 100 and P 200 latency in the paired-click task but did not affect sensory gating. Rivastigmine was able to reverse the effects of <b>biperiden</b> on N 100 and P 200 latency. <b>Biperiden</b> increased P 50 latency in the novelty oddball task, which was reversed by concurrent administration of rivastigmine. Rivastigmine shortened N 100 latency and enhanced P 3 a amplitude in the novelty oddball paradigm, both of which were reversed by <b>biperiden.</b> CONCLUSION: The muscarinic M 1 receptor appears to be involved in preattentive processing of auditory information in the paired-click task. Additional effects of <b>biperiden</b> versus rivastigmine were reversed by a combination treatment, which renders attribution of these findings to muscarinic M 1 versus muscarinic M 2 -M 5 or nicotinic receptors much more difficult. It {{remains to be seen whether}} the effects of cholinergic drugs on AEPs are specifically related to the abnormalities found in schizophrenia. Alternatively, aberrant auditory processing could also be indicative of a general disturbance in neural functioning shared by several neuropsychiatric disorders and/or neurodegenerative changes seen in aging...|$|E
40|$|As {{perturbations}} in auditory filtering {{appear to}} be a candidate trait marker of schizophrenia, there has been considerable interest in the development of translational rat models to elucidate the underlying neural and neurochemical mechanisms involved in sensory gating. This is the first study to investigate the effects of the non-selective muscarinic antagonist scopolamine, the muscarinic M 1 antagonist <b>biperiden</b> and the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil (also in combination with scopolamine and <b>biperiden)</b> on auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) and sensory gating. In the saline condition, only the N 50 peak displayed sensory gating. Scopolamine and <b>biperiden</b> both disrupted sensory gating by increasing N 50 amplitude for the S 2 click. Donepezil was able to fully reverse the effects of <b>biperiden</b> on N 50 sensory gating, but had residual effects when combined with scopolamine; i. e., it enhanced sensory gating by increasing N 50 amplitude of the S 1 stimulus. Donepezil by itself improved sensory gating by enhancing N 50 amplitude of S 1, and reducing N 50 amplitude of the S 2 click. In conclusion, due to its relatively more selective effects <b>biperiden</b> is to be preferred over scopolamine as a means for pharmacologically inducing cholinergic impairments in auditory processing in healthy rats. Changes in auditory processing and sensory gating induced by cholinergic drugs may serve as a translational model for aging instead of schizophrenia...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Oculogyric crisis {{which is}} a dystonic {{reaction}} commonly caused by typical antipsychotics treatment of acute dystonias, rarely occurs with atypical antipsychotics like clozapine. The aim of this report was to describe a rare case of clozapine-induced oculogyric crisis successfully treated with <b>biperiden.</b> Case: The patient was a 42 -year-old woman with a 19 -year history of schizophrenia treated with high-potency typical antipsychotics, risperidone and lithium augmentation with appropriate doses and duration. Because of poor response to prior medications, she was prescribed clozapine started with 25 mg/d and gradually titrated up to 150 mg/d. She has experienced two episodes of oculogyric crisis treated successfully with <b>biperiden.</b> Discussion: Although low affinity of clozapine for blocking D 2 dopaminergic receptors and its anticholinergic activity may explain the significantly lower incidence of dystonic reactions, they may happen in some patients and could be suppressed with <b>biperiden.</b> Conclusion: Clinicians should consider dystonic reaction as a possible clozapine adverse effect and {{on the basis of}} this report, clozapine-induced oculogyric crisis may be treated successfully with <b>biperiden...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Biperiden</b> {{is a drug}} used in Parkinson disease {{treatment}} and it serves also as an antiseizures compound in organophosphates poisoning. It acts as antagonist of muscarinic receptor activated by acetylcholine while the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) cleaves acetylcholine in synaptic junction into choline and acetic acid. This enzyme is inhibited by various compounds; however {{there has not been}} proposed evidence about interaction with <b>biperiden</b> molecule. We investigated this interaction using standard Ellman’s assay and experimental findings were critically completed with an in silico prediction by SwissDock docking software. Uncompetitive mechanism of action was revealed from Dixon plot and inhibition constant (Ki) was calculated to be 1. 11 [*]mmol/l. The lowest predicted binding energy was − 7. 84 [*]kcal/mol corresponding to H-bond between <b>biperiden</b> molecule and Tyr 341 residuum in protein structure of AChE. This interaction seems to be further stabilized by π-π interaction with Tyr 72, Trp 286, and Tyr 341. In conclusion, <b>biperiden</b> appears as a very weak inhibitor but it can serve as a lead structure in a pharmacological research...|$|E
30|$|Patients {{and methods}} As a whole, <b>biperiden</b> {{was used in}} 223 cases (84 % of the total). Treated {{children}} presented with severe dystonia as evidenced by inability to cooperate and to swallow. Verbal {{informed consent was obtained}} from relatives. The dosage regimen to treat drug-induced dystonic syndrome in the Swiss pharmacopea is as follows: for parenteral use in children, intravenously or intramuscularly: 0.040  mg/kg or 1.2  mg/m 2 BSA every 30, according to response and tolerance; a maximum of four doses per day should be used. The internal MSF recommendations for <b>biperiden</b> use in children were 0.01 – 0.05  mg/kg of body weight that might be repeated four times a day. Initially, <b>biperiden</b> administration was administered under medical supervision by the MSF referent at the scene.|$|E
40|$|Analysis of fasting {{effect on}} <b>biperiden</b> {{distribution}} in rats was examined. The plasma concentration at 24 hr after i. v. injection of 3. 2 mg/kg varied between 0. 4 ng/ml (10 -week-old fasted rats) and 1. 4 ng/ml (10 -week-old normal rats). The steady state distribution volume of <b>biperiden</b> in the fasted rats was smaller by 2 / 3 {{than that in}} the normal rats. The determined percentage of fat tissue per body weight reduced from 7. 6 to 2. 35 was caused by fasting. There was a good cerrelation between the steady state distribution volume of <b>biperiden</b> per lean mass body weight and the fat volume per lean mass body weight (r= 0. 989) in four different groups (10 -week-old fasted 4 -, 10 -, and 50 -week-old normal rats). The fat/plasma concentration ratios at 8 hr after the i. v. injection varied between 380 (10 -week-old normal rats) and 550 (10 -week-old fasted rats), whereas the brain/plasma concentration ratios were identical to those at steady state among the two groups. The time courses of <b>biperiden</b> concentration in plasma, brain, and fat were simulated using a physiological pharmacokinetic model. There was reasonable agreement between the model predictions and the observed data, suggesting that {{the change in the}} fat volume is a dominant determinant of the distribution volume of <b>biperiden</b> in rats. Changes in fasted tissue and plasma concentrations are discussed in relation to the clinical usefulness of the blood level monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Rationale The central {{cholinergic}} system is implicated in cognitive functioning. The dysfunction {{of this system}} is expressed in many diseases like Alzheimer's disease, dementia of Lewy body, Parkinson's disease and vascular dementia. In recent animal studies, {{it was found that}} selective cholinergic modulation affects visuospatial processes even more than memory function. Objective In the current study, we tried to replicate those findings. In order to investigate the acute effects of cholinergic drugs on memory and visuospatial functions, a selective anticholinergic drug, <b>biperiden,</b> was compared to a selective acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting drug, rivastigmine, in healthy elderly subjects. Methods A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, cross-over study was performed in 16 healthy, elderly volunteers (eight men, eight women; mean age 66. 1, SD 4. 46 years). All subjects received <b>biperiden</b> (2 mg), rivastigmine (3 mg) and placebo with an interval of 7 days between them. Testing took place 1 h after drug intake (which was around T max for both drugs). Subjects were presented with tests for episodic memory (wordlist and picture memory), working memory tasks (N-back, symbol recall) and motor learning (maze task, pursuit rotor). Visuospatial abilities were assessed by tests with high visual scanning components (tangled lines and Symbol Digit Substitution Test). Results Episodic memory was impaired by <b>biperiden.</b> Rivastigmine impaired recognition parts of the episodic memory performance. Working memory was non-significantly impaired by <b>biperiden</b> and not affected by rivastigmine. Motor learning as well as visuospatial processes were impaired by <b>biperiden</b> and improved by rivastigmine. Conclusions These results implicate acetylcholine as a modulator not only of memory but also of visuospatial abilities...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE: Traditionally, the non-selective muscarinic {{antagonist}} scopolamine {{has been}} used to induce episodic memory impairments as found in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it also impairs attention and induces drowsiness. Muscarinic antagonists more selective for the M 1 receptor might, therefore, be preferred. OBJECTIVES: We examined the effects of the M 1 antagonist <b>biperiden</b> on cognitive functions in order to test the specificity of this drug on memory performance. Additionally, we assessed whether the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor citalopram can reverse a possible biperiden-induced impairment. METHODS: The study was conducted according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way cross-over design. Sixteen volunteers received <b>biperiden</b> (2 mg), citalopram (20 mg), a combination of the two, or a placebo in counterbalanced order with a washout of at least 4 days. Cognitive tests (verbal memory, continuous recognition memory, spatial memory, choice reaction) were performed 4 and 1 h after treatment with citalopram and <b>biperiden,</b> respectively. RESULTS: <b>Biperiden</b> impaired memory performance in the verbal learning task, the continuous recognition memory test, and the spatial memory task. Effects on attention and side effects, as measured using the choice reaction time test and questionnaires respectively, could be neglected. Citalopram did not affect any of the memory or attention measures taken. Most importantly, citalopram was also unable to reverse the biperiden-induced memory impairments. CONCLUSIONS: Our results, thus, show that the M 1 antagonist <b>biperiden</b> may serve as a translational model to induce episodic memory deficits as seen in AD. However, the interactive influence of acetylcholine and serotonin on memory could not be confirmed...|$|E
40|$|Starting from trichloro(vinyl) silane (Cl_ 3 SiCH=CH_ 2), the musearinic antagonists sila-biperiden [rac-(SiRS,C 2 SR>-ao- 2] and endosila- <b>biperiden</b> [rac-(SiRS,C 2 SR) -endo- 2] were {{prepared}} by a seven-step synthesis. Both silanols are configurationally stableininert organic solvents but undergo slow epimerization {{in aqueous solution}} (pH 7. 4, 32 °C) by inversion of the configuration at the silicon atom. The relative configurations of sila-biperiden and endo-sila-biperiden were detennined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Both compounds form intennolecular 0 -H · · · N hydrogen bonds in the crystal leading to the fonnation of centrosymmetric dimers (sila-biperiden) and infinite chains (endo-sila-biperiden), respectively. Sila-biperiden is a silicon analogue (C/Si exchange) of the antiparkinsonian drug <b>biperiden</b> [rac-(CRS/C 2 SR-exo- 1]. In functional phannacological experiments, {{as well as in}} radioligand competition studies, <b>biperiden,</b> sila-biperiden and endo-sila-biperiden behaved as simple competitive antagonists at muscarinic Ml-, M 2 -, M 3 - and M 4 -receptors. The three compounds displayed the highest affinity for Ml-receptors (pA_ 2 values: 8. 72 - 8. 80; pK_i values: 8. 8 - 9. 1), intermediate affinity for M 4 - and M 3 -receptors, and lowest affinity for M 2 -receptors (pA_ 2 values: 7. 57 - 7. 79; pK_i values: 7. 7 - 7. 8). The affinity profile (Ml >. M 4 > M 3 > M 2) of <b>biperiden,</b> sila-biperiden and endo-sila-biperiden is qualitatively {{similar to that of the}} M 1 -selective muscarinic antagonist pirenzepine. The antimuscarinic properlies of the C/Si analogues <b>biperiden</b> and sila-biperiden are almost identical. Die Antimuscarinica Sila-biperiden [rac-(SiRS,C 2 SR) -exo- 2] und endo-Sila-biperiden [rac-(SiRS,C 2 SR) -endo- 2] wurden ausgehend von Trichlor(vinyl) silan (Cl_ 3 SiCH=CH_ 2) durch eine siebenstufige Synthese dargestellt. Die beiden Silanoie sind in inerten organischen Solvenzien konfigurationsstabil, unterliegen aber in wässeriger Lösung (pH 7. 4, 3 ZOC) einer Epimerisierung durch Inversion der Konfiguration am Silicium-Atom. Die relativen Konfigurationen von Sila-biperiden und endo-Sila-biperiden wurden durch Einkristall-Röntgenstrukturanalysen bestimmt. Beide Verbindungen bilden im Kristall intermolekulare 0 -H · · · N-Wasserstoff- Brückenbindungen aus, die zum Aufbau von zentrosymmetrischen Dimeren (Sila-biperiden) bzw. unendlichen Ketten (endo-Sila-biperiden) führen. Sila-biperiden ist ein Silicium-Analogon (C/Si-Austausch) des Antiparkinsonmittels <b>Biperiden</b> [rac-(CRS,C 2 SR>-ao- 1). Sowohl in funktionellen pharmakologischen Untersuchungen als auch in Radioligand-Kompetitionsexperimenten erwiesen sich <b>Biperiden,</b> Sila-biperiden und endo-Sila-biperiden als rein kompetitive Antagonisten an muscarinischen M 1 -, M 2 -, M 3 - und M 4 -Rezeptoren. Alle drei Verbindungen zeigten die höchste Affinität zu den Mt-Rezeptoren (pA_ 2 -Werte: 8. 72 - 8. 80; pKrWerte: 8. 8 - 9. 1), eine deutlich geringere Affinität zu den M 4 - und M 3 -Rezeptoren und die niedrigste Affinität zu den kardialen M 2 -Rezeptoren (pA_ 2 -Werte: 7. 57 - 7. 79; pKi-Werte: 7. 7 - 7. 8).

We evaluated the efficacy of <b>biperiden</b> (a cholinergic antagonist) in reducing craving and the amount used, and in increasing compliance with treatment for cocaine/crack addiction. It was a study double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 8 -week trial of 111 cocaine or crack addicted male patients between 18 and 50 years old. Two groups were compared: placebo (n= 55) or <b>biperiden</b> (n= 56) combined with weekly sessions of brief group cognitive-behavioural therapy. the efficacy of treatment was evaluated according to the patients' compliance and several instruments: the Minnesota Cocaine Craving Scale, the Beck Depression and Anxiety Scales and a questionnaire assessing the amount of drug used. All of the patients attended weekly sessions for two months. We analysed the data considering the patients' intention to treat based on our last observation. of the 56 patients in the <b>biperiden</b> group, 24 completed the treatment (42. 8 %) compared with only 11 patients in the placebo group (20 %), which was a significant difference (p= 0. 009).

40|$|To {{enable the}} {{development}} of effective treatments for dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), {{it is important to}} establish valid animal models of cognitive impairments. Scopolamine is widely used to induce cognitive deficits in animal models of AD, but also causes non-cognitive side effects. We assessed whether <b>biperiden,</b> a selective antagonist of M 1 muscarinic receptors, which are predominantly expressed in brain areas involved in cognitive processes, causes cognitive deficits without inducing peripheral side-effects. Two different doses of <b>biperiden</b> (3 or 10 mg kg− 1) on the acquisition of a spatial cone field task were assessed in male Lister Hooded rats.
