25|$|<b>Bill</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{have many}} things in common. We share {{the same type of}} {{religion}} and boyhood background; we got our start as schoolteachers and figured prominently in public education; we both served in public life at or near the top. And I like to feel that we share a common appreciation and respect for people, all people. One of the greatest rewards in politics is meeting people. And one of the greatest and most unusual men I've ever met is Bill Dodd.|$|E
500|$|Rashad enjoyed {{working with}} both Cosby {{and the young}} cast, {{claiming}} that the actors very much became like a real family {{as early as the}} first episode, although her real-life relationship with the child actors more-so resembled that of friends as opposed to mother. Rashad said, [...] "I think <b>Bill</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are great role models as far as our TV professions are concerned. Kids learn by example, and I think we're very good ones." [...] Second to Cosby himself, Rashad is the series' most regular cast member, appearing in a total of 212 episodes. In response to television personality Oprah Winfrey quoting a common critique of the series – [...] "How is it realistic to have a doctor and a lawyer in the same house?" [...] – Rashad defended, [...] "I grew up in Houston, Texas, in Third Ward, and it was very realistic. … I guess it just depends on who you know and what you know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rossini {{had been}} the most popular opera {{composer}} in history, {{and he was one of}} the most renowned public figures of his time. A rapid and prolific composer, he was quoted as joking, [...] "Give me the laundress' <b>bill</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will even set that to music." [...] A tendency for inspired, song-like melodies is evident throughout his scores, earning him the nickname [...] "The Italian Mozart." [...] Use of an exciting buildup of orchestral sound over a repeated phrase—commonly known as a [...] "Rossini crescendo"—also prompted the nickname [...] "Signor Crescendo".|$|E

2500|$|Although <b>Bill</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{performed}} {{at a very}} young age, and Bill, I, Barry and John did a lot of frat parties at Brown University and clubs in Newport ... the most memorable performance of what I would view as the precursor of what The Cowsills would be was at Kings Park in Newport (right at the foot of Halidon Hall) at some carnival. The family angle just evolved ... first Bill and me, then Bill me and Barry, then Bill, me, Barry and John, then Bill, me, Barry, John and Mom, then Bill, me, Barry, John, Mom and Paul, then later, me, Paul, John, Barry, Mom and Susan, then back to Bill, me, Barry and John (very briefly in the end) and then to me, Paul, John and Susan. Our first real break came when we were playing the MK Hotel in Newport (in the basement there) and a guy from the [...] "Today Show" [...] saw us and asked if we wanted to be on the [...] "Today" [...] show. We weren't famous or anything but we were young and we were related and we were quite good. So we went on [...] "The Today Show" [...] (I doubt a tape exists of that but if it did it would be priceless to see) and someone from Mercury Records saw us, which ultimately led to our signing with that label and putting out [...] "Most Of All" [...] (a great [...] "school's out" [...] song that should have been our first hit in my opinion), which led to Artie Kornfeld and Steve Duboff. Mercury dropped us, but Artie and Steve had written [...] "The Rain, The Park and Other Things" [...] and we went in and recorded that song at A studios in New York and took the whole package to MGM, who decided wouldn't it just be terrific if their mother performed with them and, voila, the rest, as they say, is history.|$|E

But I dare say {{you know that}} a man never travels with ladies in that free and easy way without feeling it in his pocket. One is apt to do twenty things for them which one wouldn't do for oneself; nor they for {{themselves}} if they had to pay the piper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose it {{were true}} that {{there was such a}} change in the <b>bill,</b> <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> struck it out,--is that a proof of a plot to force a {{constitution}} upon them against their will?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You see {{all these}} amounts. They are all owing to me from those people--money lent, and one thing and another. There is an {{envelope}} with <b>bills</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> O U's. They belong to me, you understand," [...] he said, with a sudden touch of dignity. [...] "I never failed! My business was stopped when I was taken ill, but there was enough to pay everybody. Now some of these amounts have never been collected. If I could see these people myself, they would pay, or if I could get a friend whom I could trust! But there isn't a man comes near me!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Bless me, how you frighten one! You look solemn as a hearse; but I {{promised to}} go with <b>Bill</b> to-night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> suspect another time will do just as well. What {{you have to say}} will keep, I suppose," [...] she said mischievously.|$|R

Not that they will ever get a shilling from him, though he were to be seen walking down St. James's Street to-morrow.

40|$|Everyone {{reading this}} {{editorial}} today knows that Programmatic Perspec-tives publishes scholarship that theorizes and thereby promotes sus-tained {{attention to the}} disciplinary knowledge-making dimensions of technical communication program administration. The idea of mutual men-toring underlies the work that this journal does to help shape a new scholarly space. For a while, <b>Bill,</b> Tracy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> operated under the illusion that we had in-vented the term mutual mentoring, but in fact, it’s not a new concept. Educators (Landay, 1998), educational administrators (Sorcinelli & Yun, 2009), youth men-tors (Fritzberg & Alemayehu, 2004), enterprise computing specialists (Mader, 2008), and even members of religious orders (Rexing, 2002) characterize their work as mutual mentoring. Some people use the term co-mentoring. Mutual mentoring eschews the labels mentor and protégé or (heaven help us) mentee, preferring instead a more egalitarian relationship that Sorcinelli and Yun term mentor partners (2009). For us, the term incorporates several ideas. Collaboration As <b>Bill,</b> Tracy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> prepared to propose this journal to the CPTSC executiv...|$|R
