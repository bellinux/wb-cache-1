40|$|Abstract Due to an {{increasing}} {{awareness of the}} potential hazardousness of air pollutants, new laws, rules and guidelines have recently been implemented globally. In this respect, numerous studies have addressed traffic-related exposure to particulate matter using stationary technology so far. By contrast, only few studies used the advanced technology of mobile exposure analysis. The Mobile Air Quality Study (MAQS) addresses the issue of air pollutant exposure by combining advanced high-granularity spatial-temporal analysis with vehicle-mounted, person-mounted and roadside sensors. The MAQS-platform will be used by international collaborators in order 1) to assess air pollutant exposure in relation to road structure, 2) to assess air pollutant exposure in relation to traffic density, 3) to assess air pollutant exposure in relation to weather conditions, 4) to compare exposure within vehicles between front and <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> (children) <b>positions,</b> and 5) to evaluate "traffic zone"-exposure in relation to non-"traffic zone"-exposure. Primarily, the MAQS-platform will focus on particulate matter. With the establishment of advanced mobile analysis tools, it is planed to extend the analysis to other pollutants including NO 2, SO 2, nanoparticles and ozone. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Until the 1980s, three-point belts were {{commonly}} {{available only}} in the front outboard seats of cars; the <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> were only often fitted with lap belts. Evidence of the potential of lap belts to cause separation of the lumbar vertebrae and the sometimes associated paralysis, or [...] "seat belt syndrome", led to progressive revision of passenger safety regulations in nearly all developed countries to require 3-point belts first in all outboard <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> and eventually in all <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> in passenger vehicles. Since September 1, 2007, all new cars sold in the U.S. require a lap and shoulder belt in the center rear seat. Besides regulatory changes, [...] "seat belt syndrome" [...] has led to tremendous liability for vehicle manufacturers. One Los Angeles case resulted in a $45 million jury verdict against the Ford Motor Company; the resulting $30 million judgment (after deductions for another defendant who settled prior to trial) was affirmed on appeal in 2006.|$|R
25|$|Children in {{the three-year}} old age group {{are more likely}} to have a {{fatality}} because it is the age where positioning is crucial. In some countries, children transition from facing the rear of the car to facing the front at this age. A study was done on restraints and positioning of three-year olds. It was concluded that being restrained and in the front seat has a lower fatality rate than children <b>positioned</b> in the <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> but not restrained. The safety results indicated that children should be placed in the <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> and restrained. It also suggests that restraints have a bigger impact on safety than <b>seating</b> <b>positions.</b> A lap belt used on children will not provide as much safety as it would for an adult, due to the flexibility of children. An adult seatbelt could do more harm to a child than good, which is why children should properly be utilizing the Child Restraint System instead. This system includes a booster seat and a proper belt that fits the child's criteria including age, weight and height.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of <b>seat</b> <b>position</b> on handrim biomechanics. Thirteen experienced users propelled a wheelchair over a smooth level floor at a self-selected speed.

A custom-designed axle was used to change the <b>seat</b> <b>position.</b> We used repeated measures analysis of variance to evaluate if differences existed in the temporal-distance and kinetic data with change in <b>seat</b> <b>position.</b> Results showed that a shorter distance between the axle and shoulder (low seat height) improved the push time and push angle temporal variables (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Tangential force output did not change with <b>seat</b> <b>position.</b> Axial and radial forces were highest in the lowest <b>seat</b> <b>position</b> (p 3 ̆c 0. 001).

30|$|The seated push-up test is {{a method}} of {{assessing}} {{the strength of the}} triceps, shoulder and scapular muscles. The test involves pushing the body up out of a <b>seated</b> <b>position,</b> and slowly lowering it <b>back</b> into the <b>seat.</b> The participant was placed with the knees out straight and the heels resting on the floor or table. The participant had to push their body up from the table or floor until the elbows were straight, held for 20  seconds and then slowly lowered <b>back</b> into the <b>seat.</b> The reliability of revised push-up test protocol in people without disabilities was 0.80 to 0.96 (Hong et al. 2011).|$|R

40|$|Period Covered: October 2012 -July 2013 This paper {{explores the}} {{geometric}} feasibility of installing dedicated lower anchors {{in the center}} rear <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> of vehicles. Analysis {{was based on a}} previous research study in which the lateral spacing of seat belt and LATCH lower anchorages were measured in 85 model year 2010 - 2011 vehicles. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine how many vehicles would have the physical space to incorporate a third set of dedicated lower anchors in the center <b>seating</b> <b>position</b> for child restraint installation. Usability of all of the lower anchors, as well as the seat belts, was also considered. To begin, nine vehicles that currently have dedicated lower anchors in the center position were reviewed. The distances between all seat belt anchors and lower anchors across the vehicle sample were also analyzed to identify spacings that are currently feasible in production. The arrangement of seat belt and lower anchor hardware across the rear seat was also reviewed with respect to usability. Based on these analyses, a lateral distance between the outboard webbing and outboard lower anchor of 75 to 100 mm is common. The suggested minimum distance between lower anchors and seat belt hardware is 25 mm. Based on these dimensions, vehicles with 710 mm or more between the outboard lower anchor centerlines (OBLACL) should have sufficient space to provide three sets of usable, dedicated lower anchors in the right, center, and left <b>seating</b> <b>positions.</b> Providing the highest level of usability with regard to use of seat belt or LATCH hardware in adjacent <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> would be achieved by placing each pair of lower anchors between the webbing and buckle hardware for the <b>seating</b> <b>position.</b> If the OBLACL is less than 710 mm, an improvised center LATCH position (permitting use of the inboard lower anchors from the outboard <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> to secure a child restraint in the center <b>seating</b> <b>position)</b> may be feasible. The maximum spacing of this improvised center LATCH position would be 480 mm. If a vehicle allowed an improvised center LATCH position, placing the inboard lower anchor between the outboard buckle and nearest center seat belt hardware would maximize usability of the seat belt in the outboard <b>seating</b> <b>position</b> and lower anchors in the center <b>seating</b> <b>position...</b>|$|R
