25|$|The initial NFL Network team {{consisted}} of HBO Sports' <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel</b> as play-by-play announcer, NBC Sports' Cris Collinsworth as the color commentator for the Thursday telecasts, and Dick Vermeil replacing Collinsworth for Saturday telecasts. In 2007, Collinsworth replaced Vermeil alongside Gumbel for all games.|$|E
25|$|The first brand {{extension}} of Today {{was created in}} 1982. The early morning news program Early Today was conceived as a lead-in for Today, featuring the same anchors as the main program at the time, <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel</b> and Jane Pauley. The half-hour program was fed twice to allow affiliates to carry one or both broadcasts. NBC canceled the program after a year, {{and replaced it with}} NBC News at Sunrise, originally anchored by Connie Chung.|$|E
25|$|The October 18, 1989 {{edition of}} NBC's Today {{that covered the}} {{earthquake}} ran until noon Eastern Time. <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel,</b> Jane Pauley and Deborah Norville anchored from Chicago (where they had planned to originally do a special celebratory edition), with reports done by Bob Jamieson and Don Oliver in San Francisco, and George Lewis in Oakland. Jim Miklasewski and Bob Hager covered disaster response from Washington. NBC Sports commentators Bob Costas and Jimmy Cefalo discussed the effect the temblor {{would have on the}} 1989 World Series.|$|E
25|$|The 1979 NCAA Final Four, which {{included}} the national championship game, was televised by NBC. Announcing duties were performed by Dick Enberg, Al McGuire, and Billy Packer, while the halftime show was hosted by <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel.</b> The Nielsen ratings for the championship game were 24.1; this figure is the highest for any basketball game in the United States as of 2009. The estimated audience was around 40 million people in 18 million households, {{and the number of}} viewers increased 20 percent from the 1978 NCAA Tournament final.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} {{televised}} in the United States by NBC, with Curt Gowdy handling play-by-play and sharing the booth with color commentators John Brodie and Merlin Olsen.

Also taking part in NBC's coverage were <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel,</b> Mike Adamle (who also covered the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation ceremony), Donna De Varona, and recently retired former Minnesota Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton. For this game and Super Bowl XV, NBC used a custom, synthesizer-heavy theme in place of their regular music.|$|E
25|$|The {{negative}} press only heightened {{after the}} announcement of Pauley's resignation, and Norville was put under a gag order by NBC brass, which prevented her from defending herself from the widespread and erroneous reports that she somehow orchestrated her rise on Today. In January 1990, the new anchor team of <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel</b> and Deborah Norville, minus Jane Pauley, debuted with disastrous results. Ratings for the program began to plummet. Critics felt that Gumbel and Norville lacked chemistry and many loyal viewers began turning to rival ABC's Good Morning America (GMA).|$|E
25|$|Although <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel</b> {{anchored}} NBC's pregame {{coverage for}} Game 5 of the 1980 World Series, {{he was not}} present at Royals Stadium in Kansas City. Game 5 was scheduled on a Sunday, which conflicted with Gumbel's hosting duties for the network's NFL pre-game show NFL '80. As a result, Gumbel had to anchor the World Series coverage from the NBC Studios in New York City. Gumbel, however, would be present at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia for Game 6, {{which turned out to}} be the clincher for the Phillies.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, HBO's Real Sports with <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel</b> aired a 19-year-old FBI {{videotape}} of an undercover sting operation showing Sharpton with an undercover FBI agent {{posing as a}} Latin American businessman and a reputed Colombo crime family captain. During the discussion, the undercover agent offered Sharpton a 10% commission for arranging drug sales. On the videotape, Sharpton mostly nods and allows the FBI agent to {{do most of the}} talking. No drug deal was ever consummated, and no charges were brought against Sharpton {{as a result of the}} tape.|$|E

500|$|<b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel</b> on his HBO Real Sports show in October likened Stern's role in {{the lockout}} to a [...] "modern {{plantation}} overseer, treating NBA men {{as if they were}} his boys ... keeping the hired hands in their place". The NBA owners are predominantly white, while the players are mostly black. ESPN noted that William C. Rhoden in his book $40 Million Slaves had earlier dealt with the topic of players as [...] "slaves" [...] in spite of earning millions of dollars. Stern dismissed Gumbel's comments as [...] "an occupational hazard" [...] of being the NBA commissioner. In early November, NBPA attorney Jeff Kessler criticized the owners' [...] "take it or leave it" [...] bargaining approach: [...] "instead of treating the players like partners, they're treating them like plantation workers." [...] Hall of Famer Magic Johnson called the comments [...] "ridiculous" [...] and defended Stern's record of promoting blacks. ESPN The Magazine said that the NBPA did not condone Kessler's statements, and they had intentionally avoided getting involved with Gumbel's earlier remarks. Kessler later apologized for his comments.|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} after the sale, Edwards asked Connelly if he would accept the card for his auction. Connelly consented and took the card across the country to {{prospective}} buyers. Meanwhile, HBO's Real Sports with <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel</b> decided to cover the progress of Cobb and Edwards' struggles with the card. Connelly met a card dealer in New York City, Mike Mangasarian, who was sent on behalf of a prominent collector to check the card out. Mr. Mangasarian said the card seemed authentic and stated he would attend the auction for the card later on if the card could be taken out of the thick lucite holder for a closer examination. A promise was made that this could be done the day of the auction in Binghamton, NY. After the auction and by not bidding on the card Mr. Mangasarian revealed to HBO that he felt the back of the card was indeed real but in his opinion the front was not. He explained that all T-206's have dark brown letters printed for the team and players name and this one was in black. Additionally, he stated that he was not comfortable with the print process exhibited on the card front. Meanwhile, a number of card collectors who doubted the card contacted eBay and demanded that the card's listing on the website be removed. eBay officials finally pulled the plug the day before the actual Connelly auction was to begin. As a result, a number of previously interested collectors decided not to bid for the card at the auction the next day. As Connelly pointed out, the collectors chose not to make bids because [...] "hen eBay pulled the card ... it raised too many questions about its authenticity." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{in-house}} NFL Network saw <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel</b> resign {{as their}} play-by-play announcer after two seasons on the network's Run to the Playoffs package after critics described his play-by-play calling as [...] "lackluster."

2500|$|In {{the second}} year of the NFL Network's [...] "Run to the Playoffs", Marshall Faulk and Deion Sanders {{replaced}} Dick Vermeil for two games when Collinsworth was unavailable. An unforced change saw <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel</b> miss the Broncos–Texans game December 13 due to a sore throat and NBC announcer Tom Hammond step into Gumbel's play-by-play role in {{what turned out to be}} more or less a preview of one of NBC's Wild Card Game announcing teams.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel</b> wrote {{a memo to}} the program's then-executive {{producer}} Marty Ryan, {{which was}} critical of other Today personalities, and was leaked to the press.

2500|$|In 1975, Buck {{temporarily}} {{left his}} Cardinals baseball duties {{in order to}} host the NBC pregame show, GrandStand, alongside <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel.</b> In the 1976 and 1977 seasons, he called regional NFL play-by-play for NBC. On August 16, 1976, Buck called the first-ever NFL game played outside of the United States, a preseason exhibition between the St. Louis Cardinals and San Diego Chargers held at Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo, Japan.

2500|$|In 1989, The Today Show co-host <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel</b> {{wrote an}} {{internal}} memo {{critical of the}} show's personalities, a memo that was later leaked to the media.

2500|$|By {{the time}} <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel</b> was {{appointed}} co-anchor {{of the program}} in 1982, a new version of Ellis' [...] "This is Today" [...] theme was introduced, using a looser, more relaxed arrangement that continued to feature the NBC chimes in its melody. A shorter arrangement of [...] "This is Today" [...] was used for the show open (featuring a rotating globe and the Today sunburst) from 1983 to 1985. The main theme was used until 1985, and due to its popularity with viewers was resurrected as the show's secondary theme in January 1993. The 1982 theme later served as the program's official [...] "anniversary" [...] music, used to open and close retrospective segments in the leadup to Todays 60th anniversary in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2005, {{during an}} {{interview}} with <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel,</b> Moss admitted that he has smoked marijuana during his NFL career [...] "every blue moon."

I won't get into any trouble by the NFL by saying that, you know. I have had fun throughout my years and, you know, predominantly in the offseason." [...] The interview drew criticism from the league office, and his agent tried to spin it that his words were taken out of context.

2500|$|Piper and O'Haire {{then moved}} on to {{challenge}} Tajiri and Eddie Guerrero for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but in June 2003, WWE stopped employing Piper after a controversial interview with HBO's Real Sports with <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel</b> in which Piper discussed the darker side of the wrestling industry. WWE cited that [...] "Piper stated that he used drugs for many years while working in professional wrestling and that he does not like the person that he becomes when he actively performs as a professional wrestler", and dismissed Piper because of [...] "inability to reach agreement on a contract and to assist Piper from engaging in any self-destructive behavior". On his 2006 DVD, Piper claimed that HBO took parts of his interviews out of context to make wrestling look bad.|$|E
2500|$|However, in the {{build-up}} {{to their}} first fight, The Fight of the Century, Ali {{turned it into a}} [...] "cultural and political referendum", painting himself as a revolutionary and civil rights champion and Frazier as the white man's hope, an [...] "Uncle Tom" [...] and a pawn of the white establishment. Ali successfully turned many black Americans against Frazier. <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel</b> joined the pro-Ali, anti-Frazier bandwagon by writing a major magazine article that asked [...] "Is Joe Frazier a white champion with black skin?" [...] Frazier thought this was [...] "a cynical attempt by Clay to make me feel isolated from my own people. He thought that would weaken me {{when it came time to}} face him in that ring. Well, he was wrong. It didn't weaken me, it awakened me to what a cheap-shot son of a bitch he was." [...] He noted the hypocrisy of Ali calling him an Uncle Tom when his [...] trainer (Angelo Dundee) was white.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1920s, San Quentin inmates {{have been}} allowed to play baseball. Starting in 1994 inmates have played against players from outside the prison.

A second team called the Athletics was later started, named after the Oakland Athletics. The team of outside players is called the [...] "Willing". The umpires and fans are inmates, but the coaches on the field are volunteers. Although some people {{question}} the appropriateness of baseball games being held at the prison, officials believe [...] "organized sports is a way to keep inmates occupied and perhaps teach a few lessons on getting along with others." [...] These games were detailed in a Real Sports with <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel</b> episode on June 20, 2006, and in several other documentaries.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, {{guided by}} {{human rights activist}} Ansar Burney, an HBO team for Real Sports with <b>Bryant</b> <b>Gumbel</b> used a hidden camera to {{document}} slavery and torture in secret desert camps where boys {{under the age of}} five were trained to race camels, a national sport in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This half-hour investigative report exposed a carefully hidden child slavery ring that bought or kidnapped hundreds of young boys in Pakistan and Bangladesh, who were then forced to become camel jockeys in the UAE. The report also questioned the sincerity of U.S. diplomacy in pressuring the UAE, an ally to the United States, to comply with its own stated policy of banning the use of children under 15 from camel racing. The documentary won a Sports Emmy Award in 2004 for [...] "Outstanding Sports Journalism" [...] and the 2006 Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award for [...] "Outstanding Broadcast Journalism". It also brought worldwide attention to the plight of child camel jockeys in the Middle East and helped the Ansar Burney Trust to convince the governments of Qatar and the UAE to end the use of children in the sport.|$|E
