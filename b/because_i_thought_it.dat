25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E

These guys locked in a room, to me, was fresh. I did not anticipate the ending when I read the script, so I was quite caught by surprise {{and it was clear}} to me that if the filmmakers shot the scene well, the audience would be caught by surprise as well. The film was worth doing for that moment alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Nutter said of {{the episode}} [...] "I really worked hard {{to make it a}} special show, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was special. It was Gillian's {{post-traumatic}} stress episode, because she had not really had the opportunity to vent her feelings about the whole Duane Barry situation. This was an opportunity to sit back and let all that happen." [...] Carter particularly liked the scene where a clearly disturbed Scully hugs Mulder, claiming it was a [...] "tender moment" [...] between two characters that had not shown that much affection for each other.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have asked}} him to {{undertake}} the office," [...] said the Duke solemnly, [...] "because I am told that he is fit for it. But I did have some pleasure in proposing <b>it</b> to him <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> would please you." ...|$|R

But I was wrong.” ...|$|R
500|$|With word of {{the episode}} out, {{backlash}} began. The studio received at least one bomb threat and Driscoll received a telephone call informing him {{he was going to}} Hell. DeGeneres was followed by car to the studio on at least one occasion by a [...] "suspicious man". Some within the entertainment industry assumed that the coming out was simply a ratings stunt, to which DeGeneres responded, [...] "I did it selfishly for myself and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a great thing for the show, which desperately needed a point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|Rice {{initially}} {{expressed an}} adamant stance against fan fiction {{based on her}} works, and particularly in opposition to such fiction based on The Vampire Chronicles, releasing a statement on April 7, 2000, that disallowed all such efforts, citing copyright issues. She subsequently requested that FanFiction.Net remove stories featuring her characters. In 2012, Metro reported that Rice developed a milder stance on the issue. [...] "I got upset about 20 years ago <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would block me," [...] she said. [...] "However, it's been very easy to avoid reading any, so live and let live. If I were a young writer, I'd want to own my own ideas. But maybe fan fiction is a transitional phase: whatever gets you there, gets you there." ...|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. {{purchased}} the film rights, intending Harold Becker to direct and Robert Shapiro to produce. Tom Stoppard {{wrote the first}} draft of the screenplay, on which Ballard briefly collaborated. Becker dropped out, and David Lean came to direct with Spielberg as producer. Lean explained, [...] "I worked on it for about a year and in the end I gave it up <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was too similar to a diary. It was well-written and interesting, but I gave it to Steve." [...] Spielberg felt [...] "from the moment I read J. G. Ballard's novel I secretly wanted to direct myself." [...] Spielberg found the project to be very personal. As a child, his favorite film was Lean's The Bridge on the River Kwai, which similarly takes place in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. Spielberg's fascination with World War II and the aircraft of that era was stimulated by his father's stories of his experience as a radio operator on North American B-25 Mitchell bombers in the China-Burma Theater. Spielberg hired Menno Meyjes to do an uncredited rewrite before Stoppard was brought back to write the shooting script.|$|E

All {{those years of}} sorrow: they came to her <b>because</b> of that. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> foolish of her at the time, but now I know she was wise. I want you always to love and honour her. I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't right." ...|$|R

Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment.

[...] Then he told the whole story about the papers, merely explaining that they had been torn in accident. [...] "Sir Boreas is angry with me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> right to call--you know whom--by his title, and now I am to be dismissed just when I was about to take that beautiful and accomplished young lady to the hymeneal altar.

500|$|Nesbitt's {{performance}} in Hear My Song had also impressed first-time screenwriter and film director Kirk Jones, who cast {{him in his}} 1998 feature film Waking Ned. Playing amiable pig farmer [...] "Pig" [...] Finn brought Nesbitt to international attention, particularly in the United States (where the film was released as Waking Ned Devine); the cast was nominated for the 1999 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Theatrical Motion Picture. In 1999, he appeared as the paramilitary [...] "Mad Dog" [...] Billy Wilson in The Most Fertile Man in Ireland (Dudi Appleton). The following year, he appeared in Declan Lowney's feature debut, Wild About Harry. Lowney had personally asked him {{to appear in the}} supporting role of cross-dressing Unionist politician Walter Adair. In 2001, he made his debut as a lead actor in a feature film in Peter Cattaneo's Lucky Break. He played Jimmy Hands, an incompetent bank robber who masterminds an escape from a prison by staging a musical as a distraction. On preparing for the role, Nesbitt said, [...] "Short of robbing a bank there wasn't much research I could have done but we did spend a day in Wandsworth Prison and that showed the nightmare monotony of prisoners' lives. I didn't interview any of the inmates <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be a little patronising as it was research for a comedy and also because we were going home every night in our fancy cars to sleep in our fancy hotels." [...] The film was a commercial failure, despite receiving good feedback from test audiences in the United States.|$|E
500|$|In January 1966, Wilson {{commenced}} recording {{sessions for}} the Beach Boys' forthcoming album Pet Sounds, which {{was largely a}} collaboration with lyricist Tony Asher. When the other Beach Boys returned from a three-week tour of Japan and Hawaii, they were presented with {{a substantial portion of}} a new album, with music that was in many ways a jarring departure from their earlier style. [...] According to various reports, the group fought over the new direction. Brian remembers that Carl was enthused with the album, but neither their brother Dennis nor Love were, while Asher recalls that Dennis, Love, and Al Jardine [...] "certainly" [...] expressed frustration with the new music and its lyrics. Love said: [...] "When it got to that period of Brian's life that's when he started doing a lot of drugs. We were touring a lot and we'd come back in and do an album like Pet Sounds, for instance, and some of the words were so totally offensive to me that I wouldn't even sing 'em <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was too nauseating." [...] One of his specific points of objection was the original lyrics of [...] "I Know There's an Answer", then known as [...] "Hang On to Your Ego", a reference to the ego deaths associated with psychedelics. Brian also believed that the band was worried about him separating from the group, and that they [...] "resisted" [...] the increasing number of vocal roles he had given to himself. Love wrote that he [...] "would have liked to have had a greater hand in some of the songs and been able to incorporate more often my 'lead voice,' which we'd had so much success with". Dennis denied that the band disagreed with Brian's direction on Pet Sounds, calling the rumors [...] "interesting," [...] that there was [...] "not one person in the group that could come close to Brian's talent," [...] and that he [...] "couldn't imagine who" [...] would have resisted Brian's leadership.|$|E

It was important to me that I told the story that way <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> wouldn't be told if I didn't tell <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> this was a great point in time in the 1990s in York City that needed to be documented and my life needed to be told." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{had begun}} by {{watching}} the words from his lips with a mournful regard, as though their passage were visible; but as he went on she dropped her glance. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I have thought that, too. And, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>it,</b> <b>I</b> by no means meant, in speaking of the proprieties, to be reserved and cold to you who loved me so long ago, or to hurt your heart as I used to do at that thoughtless time.

2500|$|Hoppus used three {{different}} bass guitars while recording Enema of the State: a Fender Precision Bass, Fender Jazz Bass and a Music Man StingRay. Hoppus primarily recorded {{with the two}} Fender basses, and merged the two together for the Fender Mark Hoppus Jazz Bass, which debuted in 2000. [...] "I took a Jazz Bass body <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> looked really cool and gives a good tone and then I put a P-Bass neck on it because it's a wider neck and it's easier to play—especially for my style, which isn't so much finger work," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Mike Love said [...] "some of {{the words}} were so totally {{offensive}} to me that I wouldn't even sing 'em <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was too nauseating." [...] The original lyrics of [...] "I Know There's an Answer", known as [...] "Hang On to Your Ego", created a stir within the group. He opposed the song's original message, though Jardine recalled {{that the decision to}} change the lyrics was ultimately Brian's: [...] "Brian was very concerned. He wanted to know what we thought about it. To be honest, I don't think we even knew what an ego was... Finally Brian decided, 'Forget it. I'm changing the lyrics. There's too much controversy.'" [...] On Love's reaction to the album, Jardine commented: [...] "Mike was very confused... Mike's a formula hound – if it doesn't have a hook in it, if he can't hear a hook in it, he doesn't want to know about it.... I wasn't exactly thrilled with the change, but I grew to really appreciate it as soon as we started to work on it. It wasn't like anything we'd heard before." [...] Carl Wilson said: [...] "I loved every minute of it. He [...] could do no wrong. He could play me anything, and I would love it." [...] Brian remembers that Carl was enthused with the album, but not Dennis and Mike. Author John Tobler wrote that Dennis and Bruce Johnston loved the album, but that Jardine felt [...] "It sure doesn't sound like the old stuff." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{working at}} Sega {{for two years}} Futatsugi {{submitted}} a game proposal for Panzer Dragoon which was accepted. The game was originally imagined as having vehicles rather than dragons but Futatsugi said [...] "Who doesn't {{want to try to}} ride on a dragon?... I wanted more of a softness to the game, and <b>because</b> of that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was perfect." [...] He went on to lead development on Panzer Dragoon II Zwei and Panzer Dragoon Saga before leaving Sega.|$|R
5000|$|Chris Cester {{addressed}} the media speculation in a Jared story interview for Uptown Magazine Online, stating: [...] "It's funny <b>because</b> <b>I</b> asked him point blank about that. He said I was crazy. He {{said that when}} he and David Bowie were writing 'Lust for Life', they were ripping off Motown's beat. It's funny that he said that to me because we also thought we were ripping off Motown more than 'Lust for Life'. To be honest with you that kind of annoyed me a lot, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> always <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was really lazy. People just go well 'Lust for Life' is more well-known so that's what they go for, but if you listen to a song like 'You Can't Hurry Love' (The Supremes) I think you'll find it's closer to 'Are You Gonna Be My Girl' than 'Lust for Life' ever was. And that's what Iggy said as well." ...|$|R

5000|$|American singer Christina Aguilera rose to {{prominence}} {{with the success}} of her 1999 self-titled debut album. It topped the US Billboard 200 and was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It produced three Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: [...] "Genie in a Bottle", [...] "What a Girl Wants", and [...] "Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)". Despite the success, Aguilera was displeased with being marketed as her then-manager Steve Kurtz desired, and felt unable to control her image. She told The Sydney Morning Herald her dissatisfaction with being a part of the late 1990s teen pop trend, [...] "The label Records wanted to push the cookie-cutter, ... almost virginal kind of imagery that wasn't me," [...] Aguilera said. [...] "I really wanted to squirm away from that, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was really fake and superficial and untrue of what I was about." ...|$|R
5000|$|Commentators often {{attribute}} the Spice Girls' vast marketing and merchandising efforts to their longtime manager Simon Fuller, dubbed [...] "Svengali Spice" [...] by the press. In 1997, Fuller {{was selected as}} one of Advertising Ages annual [...] "Marketing 100" [...] honorees, which awards 100 individuals for excellence in brand building. Fuller later explained in [...] "Wannabe: How The Spice Girls Reinvented Pop Fame" [...] (2004): [...] The sponsorship deals were far more about exposure than the money. A lot of money was made, but my thinking was {{if we can get}} Pepsi to spend $40 million basically running what was a commercial for my group, then Hallelujah! If Procter & Gamble wanted to launch a new image for one of their body sprays by spending £20 million … That was the way I did it. And it happened so fast. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>it</b> not as a deal in terms of making a million quid. It was about using their money to make my group famous, and then they’d make lots of money anyway.|$|R
2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of this <b>because</b> <b>I</b> merely <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was another checkpoint. However, he put a Tommy gun {{through the open window}} on my side of the car, and fired point blank at Count Bernadotte and Colonel Serot. I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead. Count Bernadotte bent forward, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{at the time he was}} trying to get cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' He nodded, and fell back.... When we arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and undervest. I saw that he was wounded around the heart and that there was also a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes about it. When the doctor arrived, I asked if anything could be done, but he replied that it was too late.|$|R

Everything else, that is, what is called the higher and spiritual part, I attribute to the superstitions incident to the terror of the hideous position in which we find ourselves, that of gods of a sort hemmed in by a few years of fearful and tormented life. But you know the old arguments, so why should I enter on them?
