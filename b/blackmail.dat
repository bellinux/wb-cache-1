40|$|Abstract. One {{important}} {{requirement of}} electronic cash systems is {{the anonymity of}} customers. Unconditional anonymity is also very well suited to support criminals in <b>blackmailing.</b> Maitland and Boyd proposed at ICICS 2001 an offline electronic cash system based on a group signature scheme. Their scheme cannot be used to solve <b>blackmailing</b> and other anonymity problems such as money laundering and illegal purchases. Chen, Zhang and Wang suggested an offline electronic cash scheme to prevent <b>blackmailing</b> by using the group blind signature. In their payment system, they used a group signature scheme of Camenisch and Stadler for large groups which is not secure. In this paper we improve these electronic cash systems to prevent <b>blackmailing,</b> money laundering and illegal purchases by using a secure coalition-resistant group blind signature scheme. Key words: cryptography, electronic cash system, <b>blackmailing,</b> group blind signatures. 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} month, Babe begins blackmailing Les anonymously. Les' wife, Pam Coker (Lin Blakley), realises Babe is the blackmailer, but is too {{ashamed to}} report it so Babe continues to increase the <b>blackmail</b> amount. Babe later threatens to reveal photos of Les crossdressing, causing Pam to humiliate herself while {{the stress of the}} <b>blackmail</b> causes Les to suffer a heart attack. When Babe discovers that Abi and Lee had sex and that Abi has passed on an STI to Lee's pregnant girlfriend, Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Babe badly burns Abi's hand. After the fling is exposed, Abi informs the Carter family about Babe's involvement and the family subsequently disown her.

40|$|<b>Blackmailing</b> may be {{the most}} serious {{drawback}} of the known electronic cash systems offering unconditional anonymity. Recently, D. Kügler proposed an on-line payment system without trusted party to prevent <b>blackmailing</b> based on the idea of marking. In this paper, some disadvantages of D. Kügler's scheme are analyzed and then a new online electronic cash scheme to prevent <b>blackmailing</b> is present by using group blind signature technique. In our scheme, the <b>blackmailed</b> cash was marked by an entity, called supervisor, therefore the bank can distinguish it from the valid cash. Also, we can modify our scheme to be offline so that it can used to decrease other crimes, e. g., money laundering, bribery etc. in electronic cash system...|$|R
