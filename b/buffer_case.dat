40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{scheduling and}} memory management in input queued switches with finite input buffers, {{with the objective}} of minimizing packet loss. The framework and algorithms proposed here apply to buffer constrained wireless networks as well. The scheduling problem has been extensively addressed under the assumption of infinite input buffers. We study the finite <b>buffer</b> <b>case</b> here which arises in practice. The introduction of memory constraint significantly complicates the problem. The optimal strategies for infinite <b>buffer</b> <b>case</b> no longer apply and become strictly suboptimal in presence of memory limitations. We present closed form optimal strategies which minimize packet loss in 2 2 switches with equal arrival rates for all streams. We identify certain characteristics of the optimal strategy for arbitrary arrival rates, and use these properties to design a near optimal heuristic. We use the insight obtained from the investigation for 2 2 switches to propose a heuristic for NN switches, arbitrary N and show numerically that this strategy performs close to optimal. The policies presented here reduce packet loss by about 25 % as compared to the optimal strategy for the infinite <b>buffer</b> <b>case...</b>|$|E

In this paper, we {{consider}} a discrete time queueing sys-tem fed by a superposition of an ON and OFF source with heavy tail ON periods and geometric OFF periods and a D-BMAP (Dis-crete Batch Markovian Arrival Process). We study the tail {{behavior of the}} queue length distribution and both infinite and finite buffer systems are considered. In the infinite <b>buffer</b> <b>case,</b> we show that the asymptotic tail behavior of the queue length {{of the system is}} equiv-alent to that of the same queueing system with the D-BMAP being replaced by a batch renewal process.

40|$|The {{debate over}} whether Frankfurt-style cases are counterexamples to the {{principle}} of alternative possibilities (PAP) has taken an interesting turn in recent years. Frankfurt originally envisaged his attack as an attempting to show that PAP is false—that the ability to do otherwise is not necessary for moral responsibility. To many this attack has failed. But Frankfurtians have not conceded defeat. Neo-Frankfurtians, as I will call them, argue that the upshot of Frankfurt-style cases is not that PAP is false, but that it is explanatorily irrelevant. Derk Pereboom and David Hunt’s <b>buffer</b> <b>cases</b> are tailor made to establish this conclusion.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a streaming communication system where the source packets must be played back sequentially at the destination {{and study the}} associated average playback delay. We assume that all the source packets are available {{before the start of}} transmission at the transmitter and consider the case of an i. i. d. erasure channel with perfect feedback. We first consider the case when the receiver buffer can be arbitrarily large, and show that the average playback delay remains bounded in the length of the stream provided that the channel bandwidth is greater than a critical threshold. Our analysis involves the application of martingale theory to study the transient behaviour of a one dimensional random walk with drift. Conversely when the channel bandwidth is smaller than the above threshold, the average playback delay increases linearly with the stream length. We also consider the finite <b>buffer</b> <b>case</b> and analyse the playback delay of a greedy dynamic bandwidth scheme. We further show through simulations that the achievable delay with a finite receiver buffer is close to the infinite <b>buffer</b> <b>case</b> for moderately large buffer values. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Relay {{stations}} {{are an important}} component of het-erogeneous networks (HetNets) introduced in the LTE-Advanced technology as a means to provide very high capacity and QoS all over the cell area. This paper develops a self-organizing network (SON) feature to optimally allocate resources between backhaul and station to mobile links. Static and dynamic resource sharing mechanisms are investigated. In the static case we provide a queu-ing model to calculate the optimal resource sharing strategy and the maximal capacity of the network analytically. The influence of relay planning and number of deployed relays is investigated, and the gains resulting from good planning are evaluated analytically. Self-optimizing dynamic resource allocation is tackled using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model. Both stability in the infinite <b>buffer</b> <b>case</b> and blocking rate and file transfer time in the finite <b>buffer</b> <b>case</b> are considered. To achieve a scalable solution with a large number of relays, a well-chosen parametrized family of policies is considered, to be used as expert knowledge.

40|$|International audienceRelay {{stations}} {{are an important}} component of heterogeneous networks introduced in the LTE-Advanced technology as a means to provide very high capacity and QoS all over the cell area. This paper develops a self-organizing network (SON) feature to optimally allocate resources between backhaul and station to mobile links. Static and dynamic resource sharing mechanisms are investigated. For stationary ergodic traffic we provide a queuing model to calculate the optimal resource sharing strategy and the maximal capacity of the network analytically. When traffic is not stationary, we propose a load balancing algorithm to adapt both the resource sharing and the zones covered by the relays based on measurements. Convergence to an optimal configuration is proven using stochastic approximation techniques. Self-optimizing dynamic resource allocation is tackled using a Markov Decision Process model.

We show that the proposed utility maximizing scheduler offers good control over the rate CDF for the full <b>buffer</b> <b>case.</b> Similarly, we show that Exp and Log rules can support a mix of QoS traffic while increasing system capacity in terms of number of users that can be supported and, at the same time, reducing resource utilization.|$|E

Using analytical results for access delay and end-to-end delay, as well as suitable approximations thereof, we propose three novel admission algorithms. The simplest Algorithm is based on queue stability, which makes it suitable for battery power-limited masters. The second algorithm estimates the access delay of the slave upon admission using the estimated first and second moments of the vacation times and makes the admission decision {{on the basis of}} predefined access delay bounds. The third algorithm is based on the predefined cycle time bounds, which makes it suitable for applications that generate constant-bit-rate data flows.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to design optimal {{scheduling}} and memory management so as to minimize packet loss in input queued switches with finite input buffers. The contribution is to obtain closed-form optimal strategies that minimize packet loss in 2 x 2 switches with equal arrival rates for all streams. For arbitrary arrival rates, the contribution is to identify certain characteristics of the optimal strategy, and use these characteristics to design a near-optimal heuristic. A lower bound for the cost associated with packet loss for N x N switches is obtained. This lower bound is used to design a heuristic which attains near-minimum packet loss in N x N switches with arbitrary N.

The {{goal of a}} streaming application is to enable the successful decoding of each video object before its displaying deadline is violated. Hence, we define the main performance metric of a streaming system as the probability of un-interrupted video presentation, or jitter-free probability. Previous literature has described solutions to estimate the jitter-free probability by assuming either independence in the encoded data process or simplistic channel models. In this work, we present a novel analytical framework, which requires only some basic statistical information of an arbitrary VBR channel, to bound the probability of jitter-free playout under the constraint of initial playout delay and receiver buffer size. Both the infinite and finite <b>buffer</b> <b>cases</b> are considered. This technique is then applied to investigate streaming over a wireless system modeled by an extended Gilbert channel with ARQ transmission control. Experimental results with MPEG- 4 VBR encoded video demonstrates that the proposed analysis derives close bounds to the actual system performance. Finally, we show that the proposed analysis provides a theoretical foundation to quantify the tradeoffs between the initial playout delay, the receiver buffer size, and the jitter-free probability for a general class of VBR streaming over random VBR channels.
