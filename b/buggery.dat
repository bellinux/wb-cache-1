5|$|The prisoners found A and B wings {{unsupervised}} as {{the prison}} officers had already evacuated, {{and began to}} free other prisoners who were still locked in their cells. The prison officer {{in charge of the}} first landing of C wing was ordered to evacuate, {{and with the help of}} three other officers evacuated the 73 Rule 43(a) prisoners being held there, being fearful for the safety of the prisoners who were regarded as sex offenders. Due to rioting prisoners entering the wing, the officers were unable to evacuate a further seven Rule 43(a) prisoners who were being held on the second landing. Rioting prisoners also gained access to E wing, where the Rule 43(a) prisoners had been left locked in their cells after the prison officers evacuated. A number of these Rule 43(a) prisoners were attacked by rioting prisoners. One such prisoner was Derek White, who was being held on remand on charges of indecent assault and <b>buggery.</b> White later died in North Manchester General Hospital on 3 April after being admitted suffering from head wounds, a dislocated shoulder and chest pains.|$|E

25|$|The {{last two}} Englishmen that were hanged for sodomy were {{executed}} in 1835. James Pratt and John Smith died {{in front of}} Newgate Prison in London on 27 November of that year. They had been prosecuted under the Offences against the Person Act 1828, which had replaced the 1533 <b>Buggery</b> Act.|$|E
25|$|In England, {{the accused}} were {{originally}} tried by church courts, which almost never punished homosexual behaviour. This changed when Henry VIII, while still {{a member of}} the Roman Catholic Church, enacted the <b>Buggery</b> Act 1533, as part of his campaign to break the power of the Catholic Church in England.|$|E
25|$|Before {{and during}} the {{formation}} of the UK, Christianity and homosexuality clashed. Same-sex sexual activity was characterised as sinful and, under the <b>Buggery</b> Act 1533, was outlawed and punishable by death. LGBT rights first came to prominence following the decriminalisation of same-sex sexual activity across the UK between 1967 and 1982.|$|E
25|$|In February 2006, a {{coalition}} of church leaders {{and members of the}} Lawyers' Christian Fellowship declared their opposition to the privacy provisions of a proposed Charter of Rights that would form the basis of an amended Jamaican Constitution. Chief among the concerns was that homosexuality could be made legal, although Justice Minister A. J. Nicholson and the leader of the opposition, Bruce Golding, denied this and opposed decriminalising <b>buggery.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Leung TC William Roy v Secretary for Justice, the {{constitutionality}} of section 118C of the Crimes Ordinance, which provides {{that a man who}} commits or suffers to commit <b>buggery</b> with a man under the age of 21 is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life, was challenged. The provision was held to be unconstitutional as while the age of consent for heterosexual couples is 16, male homosexual couples must reach 21 to have sex legally.|$|E
25|$|John Atherton (1598 – 1640) served from 1634 as Bishop of Waterford and Lismore in the Church of Ireland. In 1640 Atherton {{was accused}} of <b>buggery</b> with a man, John Childe, his steward and tithe proctor. They were tried under a law that Atherton himself had helped to institute. They were both {{condemned}} to death, and Atherton was executed in Stephen's Green, Dublin. Reportedly, he confessed to the crime immediately before his execution, although he had proclaimed his innocence before that.|$|E
25|$|In Secretary for Justice v. Yau Yuk Lung Zigo, the {{constitutionality}} of section 118F(1) of the Crimes Ordinance was challenged. The section provides {{that it is an}} offence for a man to commit <b>buggery</b> with another man otherwise in private. The Court of Final Appeal unanimously held that the section was discriminatory as it constitute unnecessary differential treatment on the ground of sexual orientation. All persons, irrespective of sexual orientation, are subject to the common law offence of committing an act outraging public decency.|$|E
25|$|Following {{colonisation}} by the British Empire, Australian {{states and}} territories inherited British anti-homosexuality laws {{such as the}} <b>Buggery</b> Act of 1533. These provisions were retained in the criminal laws passed by 19th century colonial parliaments, and subsequently by state parliaments after Federation. Same-sex sexual activity between men was considered a capital crime, resulting in the execution of people convicted of sodomy. Different jurisdictions gradually began to reduce {{the death penalty for}} sodomy to life imprisonment, with Victoria the last to reduce the penalty in 1949.|$|E
25|$|Decades {{before the}} {{formation}} of the modern United Kingdom in 1707, English law identified anal sex and zoophilia as offences punishable by hanging {{as a result of the}} <b>Buggery</b> Act 1533, which was pioneered by Henry VIII. The Act was the country's first civil sodomy law; such offences having previously been dealt with by the ecclesiastical courts. Whilst it was repealed in 1553 on the accession of Mary I, Elizabeth I re-enacted it in 1563. James Pratt and John Smith were the last two to be executed for sodomy in 1835.|$|E
25|$|Islands in the Commonwealth Caribbean adopted British <b>buggery</b> laws; however {{these laws}} {{were not as}} {{strictly}} regulated in the Caribbean as in the United Kingdom up until the Victorian era. Prior to this era, recounts were made of the island's British occupants engaging in sodomy, which may correlate {{with the fact that}} the first colonists were mostly men. The slave communities in Jamaica and the rest of the British Caribbean were made up of men and women from West Africa, the men being more sought after by slave owners.|$|E
25|$|Social {{reformer}} Jeremy Bentham {{wrote the}} first known argument for homosexual law reform in England around 1785, {{at a time when}} the legal penalty for <b>buggery</b> was death by hanging. His advocacy stemmed from his utilitarian philosophy, in which the morality of an action is determined by the net consequence of that action on human well-being. He argued that homosexuality was a victimless crime, and therefore not deserving of social approbation or criminal charges. He regarded popular negative attitudes against homosexuality as an irrational prejudice, fanned and perpetuated by religious teachings. However, he did not publicize his views as he feared reprisal; his powerful essay was not published until 1978.|$|E

500|$|In October 1940 Philip Larkin began {{studying}} English at St John's College, Oxford. A prolific writer since childhood, his primary ambition {{as an undergraduate}} {{was to be a}} novelist rather than a poet. As well publishing articles and poems [...] in Cherwell and Oxford Poetry, he wrote additional unpublished material that included fragments of semi-autobiographical stories exploring homosexual relationships among groups of undergraduates. According to Larkin's biographer Andrew Motion these writings, while of no literary value, give an indication of Larkin's confused sexuality at that time, and his growing distaste for what he terms [...] "this <b>buggery</b> business".|$|E
500|$|After Wilde {{left the}} court, {{a warrant for}} his arrest was applied for on charges of sodomy and gross indecency. Robbie Ross found Wilde at the Cadogan Hotel, Knightsbridge, with Reginald Turner; both men advised Wilde to go at once to Dover {{and try to get}} a boat to France; his mother advised him to stay and fight. Wilde, lapsing into inaction, could only say, [...] "The train has gone. It's too late." [...] Wilde was arrested for [...] "gross indecency" [...] under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, a term meaning {{homosexual}} acts not amounting to <b>buggery</b> (an offence under a separate statute). At Wilde's instruction, Ross and Wilde's butler forced their way into the bedroom and library of 16 Tite Street, packing some personal effects, manuscripts, and letters. Wilde was then imprisoned on remand at Holloway where he received daily visits from Douglas.|$|E
500|$|Nicholas Udall, vicar of Braintree and {{headmaster}} of Eton College, {{was sent}} there in 1541 for <b>buggery</b> and suspected theft; his appointment in 1555 as headmaster of Westminster School {{suggests that the}} episode did his name no lasting harm. Thomas Drury {{was sent to the}} Marshalsea on 15 July 1591, charged with [...] "diuerse greate and fonde matters"; Drury was involved in 1593 with the allegation of atheism against the playwright Christopher Marlowe. In 1629 the jurist John Selden was jailed there for his involvement in drafting the Petition of Right, a document limiting the actions of the King, regarded as seditious although it had been passed by Parliament. When Sir John Eliot, Vice-Admiral of Devon, was moved to the Marshalsea in 1632 from the Tower of London for questioning the right of the King to tax imports and exports, he described it as leaving his palace in London for his country house in Southwark. Colonel Thomas Culpeper ended up in the Marshalsea in 1685 or 1687 for striking the Duke of Devonshire, William Cavendish, on the ear.|$|E
2500|$|In England, the <b>Buggery</b> Law of 1861 was {{repealed}} in 1967. [...] By this point, Jamaica {{had already}} gained its independence in 1962, and thus its <b>buggery</b> law adopted from the British constitution, {{is still in}} force to this day.|$|E

2500|$|Jamaica has {{a heavily}} male-dominated social structure. Consequently, {{adultery}} and fornication are praised {{as signs of}} male virility in the lyrics of popular songs, particularly in Jamaican dancehall. Homosexuality (i.e., <b>buggery)</b> {{in this context is}} seen as a potential affront to the male [...] "ideal". The virulent forms of homophobia in Jamaica are attributable to norms of hypermasculinity, which is roughly equivalent to the sexual behaviours associated with machismo in Central and South America.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2013, Jamaican church pastors rallied nearly 1,500 {{people in}} Kingston {{to support the}} country's <b>buggery</b> laws.

2500|$|On 2 October 1807 Hazards first lieutenant, William Berry, 22 years old, {{went before}} a court martial {{on charges that}} he had {{committed}} a homosexual offense with Thomas Gibbs, who was a boy serving on Hazard. The board found Berry guilty. Seventeen days later Berry was hanged from Hazards starboard foreyard-arm. Unfortunately the hanging was botched in that the knot twisted under his chin. Berry had a 32-pound shot tied to his legs but still it took 15 minutes for him to strangle to death.

2500|$|Before 1533 the [...] "unnatural sin" [...] (also defined [...] "detestable crime" [...] {{in trial}} records) of sodomy or <b>buggery,</b> (a {{specific}} common law offence, meaning anal intercourse {{between a man}} and another man or woman, or anal or vaginal intercourse with a beast [...] in this way encompassing both sodomy and bestiality) was dealt with by the ecclesiastical courts. From that year however, the country's first civil sodomy law was introduced as An Acte for the punishment of the vice of Buggerie (<b>Buggery</b> Act 1533), and also criminal courts could prosecute individuals accused of such [...] "crime". [...] According to the Old Bailey Online Proceedings site:In order to obtain a conviction, it was necessary to prove that both penetration and ejaculation had occurred, and two witnesses were required to prove the crime. Both the [...] "active" [...] and [...] "passive" [...] partner could be found guilty of this offence. But due to the difficulty of proving this actual penetration and ejaculation many men were prosecuted with the reduced charge of assault with sodomitical intent.From the late 1690s to the early 1710s, the Societies for the Reformation of Manners (organizations born after the Revolution in 1688, seeking to eliminate immorality and disrespect for religion from public life) actively pursued prostitutes, Sabbath breakers and also homosexual men, through the means of spies and provocateurs to dismantle molly houses and prosecute individuals. In the 1720s and 30s thief-takers like Charles Hitchen and Jonathan Wild stimulated the Societies' activities. The peak of this wave of prosecution is to be recognized in the late 1720s with a raid on the most famous molly house, Mother Clap's. According to Rictor Norton: ...|$|E
2500|$|Several authors {{believe that}} despite his {{marriage}} Bacon was primarily {{attracted to the}} same sex. Forker, for example, has explored the [...] "historically documentable sexual preferences" [...] of King James and Bacon and concluded they were both orientated to [...] "masculine love", a contemporary term that [...] "seems to have been used exclusively {{to refer to the}} sexual preference of men for members of their own gender." [...] The well-connected antiquary John Aubrey noted in his Brief Lives concerning Bacon, [...] "He was a Pederast. His Ganimeds and Favourites tooke Bribes". The Jacobean antiquarian, Sir Simonds D'Ewes implied there had been a question of bringing him to trial for <b>buggery,</b> which his brother Anthony Bacon had also been charged with.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, George and Jane's {{marriage}} has been portrayed as an unhappy one. One modern historian {{has suggested that}} George was homosexual. British historian Alison Weir concludes that the marriage was unhappy, principally because of George, although she concludes that {{the exact nature of}} his sexuality is difficult to ascertain: [...] " [...] talented young man... he was very good-looking and very promiscuous. In fact, according to George Cavendish, he lived in 'bestial' fashion, forcing widows, deflowering virgins... it has been suggested he indulged in homosexual activity too, but there is no evidence for this, although he may well have committed <b>buggery</b> with female partners." [...] Julia Fox, Jane's most recent biographer, disagrees with both arguments, concluding that the exact nature of the marriage is unclear but suggesting that it was by no means unhappy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{campaign}} was aggravated when Vulcănescu {{showed up at}} the Credința offices and pummeled Stancu, and degenerated further when Tudor himself participated in a brawl at Corso Coffeehouse. Brezianu recalls that Vulcănescu [...] "grabbed Sandu Tudor by the collar", then slapped him. The incidents disgraced both sides. Stancu's gossip column introduced the infamous homophobic taunt cavaleri de Curlanda ("Knights of Courland", with a pun on the word cur, [...] "ass"). With Comarnescu and Negri in mind, Tudor himself wrote: [...] "Only now do we get to see all the pestilent <b>buggery</b> in their unfulfilled, masturbating, inverted souls. I shout for all to hear, I address this thirty-year-some non-generation: avast! thou tricksters, though barren and vicious ones, thou that are rotten to the core, mediocre and neurotic". According to Ornea: [...] "The strange fact is that Sandu Tudor, a religious poet and trained theologian , could stoop down to the level of such inurbane attacks".|$|E
2500|$|Others {{who held}} that missionary {{was the only}} {{permitted}} position included Alexander of Hales {{and the author of}} De secretis mulierum, who suggested that nonstandard positions might result in birth defects. Ruth Mazo Karras states that William Peraldus' treatise Summa de virtutibus et vitiis distinguished between sins against nature that were [...] "according to the substance" [...] (intercourse other than vaginal) and [...] "according to the manner, as when a woman mounts." [...] Nicholas Venette's 1770s-era sex manual praised the missionary position as the [...] "common posture...which is most allowable and most voluptuous." [...] Numerous sources have reported that in the United States, some states had outlawed positions other than missionary between husband and wife, or will grant a divorce to a woman whose husband makes love to her in another position. While many states formerly outlawed oral sex, anal sex, <b>buggery,</b> or other [...] "unnatural" [...] acts, no US law has banned dorso-ventral heterosexual sex, or specified which partner needed to be on top.|$|E
2500|$|The Sexual Offences Act 1967 was {{accordingly}} {{passed and}} received Royal Assent on 27 July 1967 after an intense late night {{debate in the}} House of Commons. It maintained general prohibitions on <b>buggery</b> and indecency between men, but provided for a limited decriminalisation of homosexual acts where three conditions were fulfilled: 1) the act had to be consensual, 2) the act had {{to take place in}} private and 3) the act could involve only people that had attained the age of 21. This was a higher age of consent than that for heterosexual acts, which was set at 16. Further, [...] "in private" [...] limited participation in an act to two people. This condition was interpreted strictly by the courts, which took it to exclude acts taking place in a room in a hotel, for example, and in private homes where a third person was present (even if that person was in a different room). These restrictions were overturned in the European Court of Human Rights in 2000.|$|E
