50|$|Later burner designs {{called the}} Haigill system and {{designated}} Mark II to Mark VI were simpler and more efficient, requiring only three lengths of pipe. Earlier versions of Haigill used two runs of evaporator pipe and one <b>burner</b> <b>pipe,</b> later versions used one run of evaporator pipe and two burner pipes.|$|E
50|$|Later still, the Hairpin burner was developed, it had one {{length of}} {{evaporator}} pipe immediately above one length of <b>burner</b> <b>pipe.</b> Hairpin {{was set in}} a specially shaped cast-iron trough in a heat-resistant concrete trench that was then covered in a grid of steel bars at ground level. This design did not generate any more heat than the earlier versions, but was much less intrusive upon air operations. Yet more sophisticated designs followed along similar lines.|$|E
50|$|The Haigas (or Mark I) burner was 50 ft {{long and}} {{comprised}} four connected lengths of pipe held just above ground level. The pipes ran {{back and forth}} in close proximity along the burner's length. After traversing the length of the burner three times, the petrol flowed into the fourth length of pipe: a <b>burner</b> <b>pipe</b> that was pierced with holes. The circuitous route of the fuel allowed it to be heated and vaporised by the heat of burners, this was done so that it would burn efficiently and without producing significant amounts of smoke.|$|E

40|$|Abstract   The fuel is {{put into}} the process through a <b>burner</b> <b>pipe</b> and this <b>burner</b> <b>pipe</b> is {{modified}} to reach a more efficient combustion. The primary target is to enable burning of heterogeneous alternative fuels and increase the production level. Other positive effects from this type of optimization is lowered specific fuel consumption and lowered CO 2 emissions. A redundant burner is chosen for the project and overall the project steps are the following: 1. Installing a Jet air nozzle ring in a way so it can move both axially and radially due to temperature changes. 2. Remove the present refractory from the burner and order a new form to decrease {{the weight of the}} burner 3. Place a K 6 blower in operating the axial channel. 4.

With the help of proven potential in the kiln system be able to convince management of the proceeds to invest in a new burner 8. If point 7 is fulfilled with the help of experience, be able to operate as a projectcoordinator in the purchase of a professional burner. This task will include coordinating the project group in various meetings and then lead to an RFQ (Request For Quotation). Results from the project show the great potential in an optimization of a burner at a cement plant. A production increase of 5 % could be seen together with a lowered specific energy consumption which is extremely satisfactory results. Unfortunately a breakdown of the system occurred a bit down the path of optimisation that resulted in damages to the kiln. At this stage the optimization was stopped and the old burner was put back after finished kiln repair. Finally crucial to underline is that the proven results in this study convinced the Group Management of buying a new burner. The benefits from a professional tailor made burner are far greater than the cost of buying it. The payback time is roughly around a year for such an investment depending on current market conditions. In this report focus is put on the combustion process at a cement plant.

40|$|One of {{the first}} steps in the beer brewing process is to heat water to a {{specific}} temperature before it is mixed with the malt. The purpose of this project {{was to make a}} more compact and efficient heating device for the beer brewing process. The output temperature must be between 170 ⁰F and 180 ⁰F. The minimum flow rate should be half a gallon per minute with the maximum flow rate of three gallons per minute. The device will also need to mount to a collapsible beer rack being designed by Andrew Kastning. The device will be primarily compromised of two 2 inch steel square tubes welded forming an L shape, a <b>burner,</b> coiled copper <b>pipe</b> and a cover made of stove pipe for the coils that will be mounted to the L shape welded steel square tubes and above the burner. Analysis was completed to determine the optimal size of copper tubing to most efficiently heat the water. Three-eighth inch copper pipe was selected for the coil. Upon testing the device the flow rate was able to be dialed down between one half and three gallons per minute while staying in between the desired temperature range of 170 ⁰F and 180 ⁰F...|$|R
40|$|A Hilton {{combustor}} was substantially {{modified to}} a suitable symmetrical configuration for research purposes. Provisions for swirl, preheat and injection of LCV gases were incorporated with appropriate burner management systems for safe operation. Instrumentation for temperature, velocity and concentration measurements {{was developed and}} fully automated by interfacing to a microprocessor for rapid data acquisition. Flame stability limits were determined {{over a wide range}} of operating conditions by varying swirl, secondary air temperature and excess air levels while maintaining the burner momentum constant. Addition of swirl up to a limit of O~ 69 generally improved stability. Preheating secondary air alone was beneficial only if the temperature was raised to at least 250 oC. A combination of intermediate swirl and moderate preheat of the secondary air resulted in satisfactory flame stability over a wide range of calorific values of the fuel. Thus, existing concentric <b>pipe</b> <b>burner</b> systems may be easily modified at low cost to burn LCV gases of variable compositions. With LCV gas flames the excess air factor (EAF) had a major influence on values of temperature, species concentration and velocity. Unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC) and CO not surprisingly increased in concentration close to the blow-off limits under the majority of operating conditions. This indicated incomplete combustion probably resulting from the lowered flame temperatures and partial flame lift-off. On the other hand, burnout efficiencies at the exhaust were reasonably high for most operating conditions involving LCV gases. The combustion data were analysed to extract the characteristic mixing and chemical reaction times the ratio of which gave the parameter epsilon, originally proposed for unconfined flames. Close to the blow-off limit epsilon took the value 4. 9 compared with 6. 2 for fully stable flames. This finding showed that the criterion was also valid for confined flames, supporting the extinction mechanism proposed by Peters and Williams, and providing an important basis for predicting stability limits and burner design parameters...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} {{a detailed}} study comprising the simulation, design, construction, and experimental validation of two prototypes of looped-tube travelling wave thermoacoustic electricity generators. The prototypes used air at atmospheric pressure as working gas, an audio loudspeaker as linear alternator, {{while most of}} acoustic resonator parts were made of PVC components. The hot heat exchangers were externally heated. The first prototype was a small size, single-stage generator powered by combustion from a propane gas <b>burner.</b> The feedback <b>pipe</b> includes a branched alternator and an acoustic impedance matching stub. The effect of the heat input on the generator performance has been investigated. 13 W of electrical power, extracted by 12 Ω electric load, was achieved at flue gas temperature of 627. 4 °C and regenerator temperature difference of 430 K. The second prototype was a larger sized (resonator inner diameter is 128 mm) two-stage generator. Here, the heat source was an electric air heat “gun” than provides air stream at 650 °C. Firstly, the single-stage engine was examined at frequencies of 48. 82, 64. 45 and 70. 31 Hz. The experiments show that the streaming can reduce acoustic power from 110. 63 to 63. 4 W at 70. 31 Hz. Furthermore, the acoustic power increases from 111. 45 to 153 W when the frequency is increased from 48. 82 to 64. 45 Hz. Subsequently, a linear alternator {{was attached to the}} engine to convert the produced acoustic power into electricity. At a load of 9 Ω the single-stage generator achieved 8. 52 W of electricity and 1. 47 % efficiency. The generator was further improved by incorporating an identical second stage. The effects of matching stub length, variable load and heat input were investigated. The two-stage prototype generated 14. 18 W of electrical power to a load of 9 Ω with a thermal-to-electrical efficiency of 2. 1 %. The result indicated that the generators can supply enough electricity to power LED bulbs, and charge mobile phones and batteries...|$|R
