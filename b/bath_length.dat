40|$|BackgroundNearly {{all women}} shower or take baths during early pregnancy; however, bathing habits (i. e., shower and <b>bath</b> <b>length</b> and frequency) {{may be related}} to the risk of {{maternal}} hyperthermia and exposure to water disinfection byproducts, both of which are suspected to increase risk for multiple types of birth defects. Thus, we assessed the relationships between bathing habits during pregnancy and the risk for several nonsyndromic birth defects in offspring. MethodsData for cases with one of 13 types of birth defects and controls from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study delivered during 200022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2007 were evaluated. Logistic regression analyses were conducted separately for each type of birth defect.

40|$|Direct {{method is}} {{commonly}} used to compute the thermal conductivity of a nanoscale material after molecular dynamics simulation. Direct method simply applies Fourier 2 ̆ 7 s Law to get the value of thermal conductivity, which requires heat flux, cross sectional area and temperature gradient. A typical structure includes one heat source, one heat sink and a device region between them. Although it is usually assumed that the temperature gradient is a constant through the entire device region, the temperature profile is not linear for a material in nanoscale because phonon mean free path {{is comparable to the}} size of the whole system. Furthermore, <b>bath</b> <b>length</b> and device length can have influence on temperature profile. In this project, two methods of temperature gradient computing and the size effect of each method are discussed. Method 1 uses the center region of the device to get temperature gradient and method 2 uses the temperature difference between hot bath and cold bath divided by the device length as temperature gradient. The thermal conductivity computed from Green-Kubo method is used as a standard to test the two calculation methods and the size effect. Argon with atomic weight 40 is used as the nanoscale material because of its moderate phonon mean free path. Result shows that both method 1 and method 2 can compute the bulk-limit thermal conductivity but the necessary size conditions are different. Method 1 requires a long device and method 2 requires a long bath region...|$|E

These experiments were running under laboratory conditions. The <b>bath</b> <b>length</b> was 5 minutes. The fish eggs incubation proceeded on laboratory dish at average water temperature, which was for the carp 22. 87 ? 1. 38 (min. 20. 5; max. 23. 8) °C, for the sheatfish 24. 03 ? 2. 12 (min. 20. 4; max. 25. 5) °C, for the tench 20. 40 ? 2. 13 (min. 18. 0; max. 22. 5) °C, for the common barbel 16. 8 ? 0. 95 (min. 14. 5; max. 18) °C, and for the African sharptooth catfish 22. 50 ? 0. 35 (min. 22. 0; max. 23. 0) °C. Using Jodisol the best hatching success for the common carp was achieved when the concentration was 1 ? 10 ml?l- 1, for the sheatfish 1 ml?l- 1, for the tench 20 ml?l- 1, and for the common barbel 50 ml?l- 1. Using Aquahum the best hatching success for the common carp was achieved when the concentration was 1 ml?l- 1, for the sheatfish 0. 1 ml?l- 1, for the tench 2 ml?l- 1, and for the common barbel 0. 1 and 2 ml?l- 1. The stable preparation Aquahum with concentration 0. 05 ml?l- 1 proved the best results for the sheatfish. The preparation Primrose used for the African sharptooth catfish proved the best results with concentration 0. 0033 and 0. 01 ml?l- 1. The detergent Aquahum could be recommended for the baths of the common barbel and the common carp. Jodisol worked well for the tench and the sheatfish.

40|$|We {{present the}} Reduced Operator Approximation: a simple, {{physically}} transparent and computationally efficient method of modelling open quantum systems. It employs the Heisenberg {{picture of the}} quantum dynamics, which allows us {{to focus on the}} system degrees of freedom in a natural and easy way. We describe different variants of the method, low- and high-order in the system-bath interaction operators, defining them for either general quantum harmonic oscillator baths or specialising them for independent baths with Lorentzian spectral densities. Its wide applicability is demonstrated on the examples of systems coupled to different baths (with varying system-bath interaction strength and <b>bath</b> memory <b>length),</b> and compared with the exact pseudomode and the popular quantum state diffusion approach. The method captures the decoherence of the system interacting with the bath, while conserving the total energy.

40|$|Practical {{implementations}} {{of quantum}} technology {{are limited by}} unavoidable effects of decoherence and dissipation. With achieved experimental control for individual atoms and photons, more complex platforms composed by several units can be assembled enabling distinctive forms of dissipation and decoherence, in independent heat baths or collectively into a common bath, with dramatic consequences {{for the preservation of}} quantum coherence. The cross-over between these two regimes has been widely attributed in the literature to the system units being farther apart than the <b>bath's</b> correlation <b>length.</b> Starting from a microscopic model of a structured environment (a crystal) sensed by two bosonic probes, here we show the failure of such conceptual relation, and identify the exact physical mechanism underlying this cross-over, displaying a sharp contrast between dephasing and dissipative baths. Depending on the frequency of the system and, crucially, on its orientation with respect to the crystal axes, collective dissipation becomes possible for very large distances between probes, opening new avenues to deal with decoherence in phononic baths...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} growth of well-aligned ZnO {{nanorods}} that were successfully synthesized on copper (Cu) substrate by using a simple hydrothermal method at low temperature leading to a robust large area nanogenerator (NG) based on cost effective Cu electrode which could enable energy harvest from the walking motions. First, the seed layer of gold (Au) has been deposited by plasma sputtering.

Twenty-seven NGs were developed with maximum output voltage that exceeded to 1. 8 [*]V and maximum output current that exceeded to 148 [*]nA.

The preparation and preservation of entangled quantum states is particularly relevant for the development of quantum computers, where interacting qubits must produce states sufficiently long-lived for meaningful manipulation. The state lifetime, typically referred to as a decoherence time, is derived from coupling to the background environment. For solid state quantum 1 computing schemes, the qubits are typically electron spins, and they couple to two generic background environments (1). The oscillator-bath — i. e. delocalised environmental modes (2), such as thermal vibrations coupled via magneto-elastic terms to the spins — can be escaped by lowering the temperature to a point where the lattice is essentially frozen.

40|$|Effects of {{stimulation}} frequency history on length-force characteristics were determined for rat medial gastrocnemius muscle (GM). The peripheral nerve was stimulated supramaximally {{according to two}} stimulation protocols. First, {{a complete set of}} length-force data were obtained by stimulating the nerve with a decreasing stimulation frequency (DSF) staircase composed of five successive pulse trains (200 ms each) of 100 -, 50 -, 40 -, 30 - and 15 -Hz stimulation. Then length-force data were obtained using constant stimulation frequency (CSF; during the isometric contraction inter-stimulus interval was constant). The acquisition order of a complete set of length-force data was: first 15 -Hz, then 30 -, 40 -, 50 - and finally 100 -Hz stimulation. For all DSF conditions, <b>bath</b> optimum muscle <b>length</b> as well as active slack length were shifted significantly (P< 0. 05) to lower muscle length with respect to CSF. Muscle length range between active slack and optimum length for all DSF conditions was increased significantly with respect to CSF. DSF thus caused a marked shift of the length-force relationship to lower muscle length compared to the CSF-dependent length-force relationship. As a result of this shift, muscle force enhancement (potentiation) was non-linearly related to muscle length; force enhancement decreased exponentially with increasing muscle length. In addition, DSF-dependent length-force characteristics are not scaled and shifted versions of those for CSF. Possible factors affecting these length-force characteristics are higher intracellular calcium concentration, myosin light chain phosphorylation, fatigue during sustained contractions, interaction between aponeurosis and fibre length, distribution of fibre mean sarcomere length with respect to muscle length, and muscle length changes during unfused tetanic contractions. It is concluded that length-force characteristics of rat GM are dependent on both short-term stimulation frequency history as well as stimulation frequency per se...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to amplify the ancient DNA from a {{collection}} of 63 Romano-British neonatal skeletons, in order to determine their sex. The DNA testing strategy has been designed to overcome the issues associated with ancient DNA investigations, including degraded template DNA, inhibition of PCR, and modern contaminants. Ancient DNA has been extracted using a silica based method using the GENECLEAN Kit for Ancient DNA. Three different PCR-Cleanup kits were investigated to determine their effectiveness in the removal of PCR inhibitors. The PowerClean kit (MoBio Laboratories) proved the most effective, and was used throughout. Two different sets of primers were used to provide amplicons from the Amelogenin gene. The Amel-A and Amel-C primers used by Arnay-de-la-Rosa (2007) proved to be ineffective, with multiple problems with non-specific binding and lack of amplification of the target region. However, the amelogenin primers from the AmpFISTR Identifiler kit proved more effective and were chosen for use in testing the ancient material. Modern DNA is used through the study to compare to the ancient material, in order to allow for pre-testing of the techniques and optimisation of the PCR without the loss of precious material. Modern DNA was also artificially degraded in order to determine whether the PCR technique can amplify fractured DNA. In this experimentation, the Identifiler primer PCR successfully amplified modern DNA that had been degraded for 15 minutes in an ultrasonic <b>bath,</b> to a <b>length</b> of approximately 100 - 500 bp in size.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{study of}} the Direct Current Electric Arc Furnace (DC-EAF) for steel-making {{has been carried out}} through the development of a rigorous mathematical model. The mathematical representation involves the simultaneous solution of Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic fields, and the turbulent fluid flow and heat transfer equations. In solving the arc and bath regions it was assumed (and justified) that the arc-bath interactions are dominated by the behavior of the arc. In contrast to previous modeling investigations, this work relaxes some critical assumptions and provides a more realistic and comprehensive representation of the system. This work also examines and compares the relative merits of alternative electromagnetic and turbulence formulations, and addresses the role of induced currents and compressibility effects in the representation of the arc. Furthermore, due allowance was made to represent and analyze the effect of gas injection, the presence of a slag layer in the bath and changes in anode configuration {{at the bottom of the}} reactor. Because of a lack of experimental information on actual or pilot plant DC-EAF systems, different aspects of the model were validated using several sources of experimental data reported in the literature for related systems. These included measurements on welding arcs, laboratory scale high-intensity carbon arcs, electromagnetically driven metallic systems, and ladle metallurgy physical models. It was found that, in general, the agreement between measurements and predictions was good. A detailed analysis was carried out to examine the effect of process parameters (e. g., arc current, arc <b>length,</b> <b>bath</b> dimensions, anode arrangements, etc) on the behavior of the furnace (e. g., heat transfer to the bath, heating efficiency, mixing times in the bath, etc). Predictions from the arc model show that all the arc characteristics are strongly coupled and that the arc physics is governed by the expansion of the arc. From a parametric study it was found that when the arc region (defined by the 10, 000 K isotherm) is plotted in dimensionless form, a universal shape for the arc can be defined, regardless of the values of arc current or arc length. This universality was restricted to the range of conditions analyzed in this thesis, to arcs struck between graphite cathodes in air, and does not include the jet impingement region on the bath surface. This common arc expansion behavior suggested the universal nature of other arc characteristics. Universal maps of temperature, magnetic: flux density, and axial velocity are also reported in terms of simple analytical expressions. The practical effects of the two main process parameters of the arc region,. i. e. the arc current and the arc length, were analyzed. It was found that increasing the arc length significantly increases the arc resistance and, consequently, the arc power, although this behavior reached asymptotic values at larger arc lengths. Increasing the arc current, however, does not affect the arc voltage. Thus, it is found that increasing the arc power increases the amount of energy transferred into the bath, but the heat transfer efficiency decreases. Therefore, the shorter the arc the more efficient is the heat transfer to the bath. It is also recognized that heat transfer from the arc to the bath is controlled by convection, although radiation can become an important mechanism, especially for large arc lengths. Results of the bath model indicate that, in the absence of inert gas stirring and with no slag present in the system, electromagnetic body forces dominate and are responsible for the fluid flow patterns in the system. The effects of the arc determine the distributions of temperature and other mixing characteristics in the bath. The bath model was used to evaluate the effect of the main process parameters and design variables on mixing, refractory wear, temperature stratification, and heat transfer efficiency. An increase in the arc length is detrimental to mixing but increases the rate of heating in the melt as a result of the increased arc power. Increasing arc current improves mixing and the heat transferred to the bath, but is likely to be detrimental to the life of the bottom refractory. The results also suggest that high furnace aspect ratios (taller and thinner arc furnaces) are highly recommended because an increase in the aspect ratio increases mixing, prevents refractory wear, and promotes arc heating efficiency. The arc configuration in the furnace can be changed to control fluid flow patterns in the bath to meet specific needs, such as better mixing, or to prevent refractory wear. The presence of a top layer of slag reduces mixing and increases overall liquid temperatures. Injection of gases through the bottom in eccentric operations generates complex flow patterns that improve mixing in regions away from the symmetry axis. It is the author's belief that this model is a useful tool for process analysis in the DC-EAF. It has the capability to address many issues of current and future concern and represents one component of a fundamental approach to the optimization of DC-EAF operations. by Marco Aurelio Ramírez.
