5|$|Gatlif {{wanted to}} {{represent}} the entire Romani community through the characterization of Félix Lavil dit Taloche's naiveté and purity. For example, Taloche is shown as <b>being</b> <b>afraid</b> of ghosts, which echoes the Romani phobia. For Taloche's role, Gatlif needed a musician with acrobatic skills, which {{was very hard to}} find. In Paris at the Théâtre de la Ville, he was impressed James Thiérrée, a grandson of Charlie Chaplin. A non-Romani, (though Chaplin's grandmother was Romani) Thiérrée learned Romanes and Romani swing music in six months.|$|E

In 1573 the village was plundered by the Turkish beg of Esztergom (Strigonia). At this time Great Guta had already been destroyed together with its old church, although the village had partially been protected by embankments which were a part of the fortress system of Kolárovo.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{abstinence}} is {{the practice}} of refraining from some or all aspects of sexual activity for medical, psychological, legal, social, financial, philosophical, moral or religious reasons. For the last twenty years, abstinence rates among American adolescents have risen. The percentage {{of high school students}} in the US who reported that they have ever had sexual intercourse dropped from 54.1% in 1991 to 47.8% in 2007 and to 43% in 2011. A cross-sectional survey in 1998 found that fear of pregnancy was the most commonly cited reason for choosing abstinence, especially among girls, as well as boys who had caused a pregnancy in the past. Other reasons included a fear of sexually transmitted infections, a lack of desire, <b>being</b> <b>afraid</b> of getting caught, and the belief that sex was not appropriate for someone of their age.|$|E

25|$|After the Americans {{launched}} an invasion in July 1812, the war raged {{back and forth}} along the border of Upper Canada, on land {{as well as on}} the waters of the Great Lakes. The British succeeded in capturing Detroit in July, and again in October. On July 12, US General William Hull invaded Canada at Sandwich (later known as Windsor). The invasion was quickly halted and Hull withdrew, giving General Isaac Brock the excuse he needed to abandon his previous orders and advance on Detroit, securing Shawnee chief Tecumseh's aid to do so. At this point, even with his aboriginal allies, Brock was outnumbered approximately two to one. However, Brock had gauged Hull as a timid man, and particularly as <b>being</b> <b>afraid</b> of Tecumseh's confederacy; he was thus able to convince Hull to surrender. The defeat of Detroit was utter and complete. A major American thrust across the Niagara frontier was defeated at the Battle of Queenston Heights, where Sir Isaac Brock lost his life.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without <b>being</b> <b>afraid</b> or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E

She also explained that the theme of {{the song was}} freedom, saying that the song's lyric [...] "Remember who you really are" [...] was [...] "exactly everything you could assume it means". Another inspiration for the song came from Lee's life, [...] "That song is me talking to myself about not <b>being</b> <b>afraid</b> and coming back to this thing and living the life I was born to live. Sometimes, it takes a lot to do this. And I do love it very much, but there is always that fear of putting yourself under the microscope." ...|$|E

Squidward {{continues}} by telling SpongeBob that every Tuesday night (the night it happens to be) the ghost of the Slasher returns to the Krusty Krab. Squidward says that the Slasher's arrival will be indicated by three warnings: the lights flickering on and off, the phone ringing but nobody being on the other line, and the ghost of the bus that killed the Slasher arriving to deliver him.|$|E
500|$|Both {{schools of}} thought in New York agreed that eating with one's fingers and not <b>being</b> <b>afraid</b> to get messy were {{integral}} {{to the culture of}} the beefsteak. No matter which type of beefsteak a diner attended, the main course was beef loin dipped in butter-based sauce and served thinly sliced on rounds of bread (day-old bread, at East Side beefsteaks; fresh toast, at West Side). Napkins were considered unnecessary; diners generally wore aprons with which they could wipe the grease off their hands. Food was dispatched from the kitchen laid out on trays and waiters continued bringing out trays until diners could literally eat no more (In his New Yorker article, Joseph Mitchell quotes one man as saying, [...] "I'm so full I'm about to pop. Push those kidneys a little nearer, if you don't mind."). Beer flowed freely during banquets in pre-prohibition years.|$|E

[...] Duffy praised the [...] "motley crew of cellblock characters" [...] and the [...] "taut, ingenious storytelling of series creator Paul T. Scheuring and his staff." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today commented on the [...] "harebrained absurdities that have swamped this show", and accused the writers of being [...] "incredibly lazy" [...] for the continuous use of the tattoo as an [...] "all-purpose plot fix". Ahsan Haque and Christopher Monfette of IGN credited the creators for not <b>being</b> <b>afraid</b> to take risks, which they felt [...] "paid off for the most part". The reviewers found the biggest success factors to be [...] "the constant swerves and twists" [...] throughout the season, and [...] "the development of the hero-villain relationship between Scofield and Mahone".|$|E

5000|$|He wrote a work on Pedagogues (...) {{from which}} Diogenes Laërtius has {{preserved}} an anecdote concerning Diogenes of Sinope:Cleomenes {{in his work}} on Pedagogues says that Diogenes' friends wanted to ransom him, for which he called them simpletons, for, he said, lions are not the slaves of those who feed them, but rather those who feed them are {{at the mercy of}} the lions, Fear, he added, is the mark of the slave, whereas wild beasts make human <b>beings</b> <b>afraid</b> of them.The importance of this anecdote is that it is an early reference to the story of Diogenes being captured by pirates and being sold into slavery, lending credence to the idea that the story may well be true.|$|R

500|$|Myrie-Williams is {{generally}} deployed as a winger, and can play on either flank. He is predominantly left-footed, {{and has been}} used on the wing {{for the majority of}} his career. Despite being left-footed, Myrie-Williams states that he is much more comfortable on the right wing— cutting inside and getting a shot on goal. He has been described as being [...] "blessed with searing pace and an impressive left foot", causing defenders [...] "countless problems". Myrie-Williams believes that his strongest attribute is that he [...] "loves running at defenders", as well as being [...] "pretty confident with the ball at his feet" [...] and [...] "not <b>being</b> <b>afraid</b> to take anyone on due to his pace". He also states that he can [...] "spot a good pass", and gets as much enjoyment assisting goals as he does scoring them. He {{has been described as a}} [...] "direct winger" [...] with [...] "a habit of drifting out wide". Myrie-Williams often takes set-pieces and has been described as a [...] "dangerous crosser of the ball".|$|E
500|$|Gaga further {{elaborated}} on {{the inspiration}} behind the song as walking towards the light force {{in her life}} and peering towards the devil in the back, while clutching onto {{the source of the}} light. [...] "I sing about what a holy fool I am, and that although moments in my life are so cruel and relationships can be so cruel I’m still in love with Judas. I still go back again to those evil things," [...] she said. During her interview with Google, Gaga added to the song's meaning as honoring one's inner darkness in order to bring themselves into the light. One has to learn to forgive themselves in order to move on with their life. With Popjustice she clarified that {{she has a lot of}} things that have haunted her from her past, including her choices, men, drug abuse, <b>being</b> <b>afraid</b> to go back to New York, confronting old romances. Hence [...] "Judas" [...] represented something that was not good for her, something she could not escape. Gaga said: [...] "I keep going back and forth between the darkness and the light in order to understand who I am." ...|$|E
500|$|The disappearances {{led to a}} {{very severe}} crisis of {{confidence}} within the publishing sector, with many booksellers <b>being</b> <b>afraid</b> to sell such books on mainland politics or featuring gossip on political figures. As of 7 January 2016, over 500 publishers, writers, booksellers {{and members of the}} public had signed an online petition pledging to [...] "not fear the white terror and uphold the principle of publication freedom". Some booksellers began to pull anti-China books off shelves. Singapore-owned Page One removed some of the books published by Mighty Current – in particular many titles focusing on Xi Jinping – from their retail outlet at Hong Kong airport. The head of Open Publishing decided to abort the publication of Xi Jinping's Nightmare, which had already come back from the printers. The author was unable to find a publisher in Hong Kong, and has gone to Taiwan. Richard Charkin, president of the International Publishers Association expressed [...] "deep concern" [...] for the missing men and called for their safe return home. He added that the disappearances [...] "immediately raise dire questions about the Chinese government's commitment to freedom to publish".|$|E

500|$|West {{received}} similar {{approval from}} Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy, {{both of whom}} contributed to the album. During an interview, when asked what music today inspires him, Wayne stated [...] "everybody's doing their thing, but they're not exciting. Everybody {{is doing the same}} thing. That's terrible. Do I love the music that's out right now? I love it with a passion. Does it motivate me? Not one bit. That's because 808s & Heartbreak isn't out yet." [...] Despite the approval from the rap superstars, as well as the record-breaking chart performances of the first two singles, hip hop audiences remained indifferent towards the album, predicting it would flop. Responding to reviews, West stated that he didn't care about sales or getting good ratings, saying that it came from the heart and that's all that matters to him. When asked about the current state of hip hop, West compared it to a high school, stating that hip hop used to be all about being fearless and standing out, and that now it is about <b>being</b> <b>afraid</b> and fitting in. Michael Jackson was an admirer of the album, with his daughter saying he played it for her [...] "all the time".|$|E
500|$|On February 17, 2009, Brunner {{announced}} {{that she would be}} a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2010. She ran against Fisher for the Democratic nomination. In September 2009, DSCC Chairman Bob Menendez, who supported Fisher and had been trying to clear the field for him, stated he would actively work against any underfunded candidate, in which Brunner eventually responded [...] "I'm not scared of you" [...] at a fundraiser in Washington D.C. in December of that year. By February 2010, she had significantly less cash on hand than Fisher or likely general election opponent Rob Portman (who would eventually win the seat), but claimed, [...] "I only need enough money to win," [...] adding, [...] "And frankly, in this economic environment, it's rather obscene when people start crowing about how many millions they have on hand." [...] Polling in late 2009 and January 2010 showed Brunner to be more competitive than Fisher in a general election matchup against Portman, while Fisher and Brunner were deadlocked in Democratic primary polling. Her budget-spirited campaign employed [...] "Rosie the Riveter" [...] imagery and the use of an old school bus called [...] "The Courage Express" [...] to travel across the state. During the campaign Fisher faced accusations of <b>being</b> <b>afraid</b> of Fox News and being too staged and not genuine. The final Quinnipiac Poll released at the end of April showed Brunner leading Fisher among men 38-24% and defeating Portman 40-36%.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the 2003 Slayer box set Soundtrack to the Apocalypse, Adrien Begrand of PopMatters {{described}} the album as [...] "their most underrated, {{and on this}} set, its five selections show how highly the band thinks of the record". KNAC.coms Peter Atkinson was also positive, saying the album has a [...] "grandiosity and imposing presence" [...] which makes the record [...] "so magnificent". Grave's Ola Lindgren and Bolt Thrower's Karl Willetts both rate South of Heaven as amongst the top five albums of all time, while Max Kolesne of Brazilian death metal group Krisiun remembers hearing the song [...] "Silent Scream" [...] for the first time: [...] "It just blew me away. It was like fast double-bass, fast kicks during the whole song. That was very inspiring for me." [...] When discussing Slayer in an October 2007 interview, Evile frontman Matt Drake stated that while Reign in Blood [...] "was just speed", South of Heaven proved that the group could write [...] "slow material as well". Metal Forces reviewer gives [...] "the band credit for at least {{making an effort to}} try something new and not <b>being</b> <b>afraid</b> to experiment at such a crucial stage of their career", creating [...] "one of the more original sounding thrash / speed metal albums he heard in a long while". He remarks, however, that [...] "if you're expecting to hear Reign in Blood Part Two, you'll be in for a major disappointment".|$|E
