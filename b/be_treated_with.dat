5|$|Brachytherapy for {{prostate}} cancer may cause erectile dysfunction in approximately 15-30% of patients. However, the risk of erectile dysfunction is related to age (older men are at a greater risk than younger men) and also the level of erectile function prior to receiving brachytherapy. In patients who do experience erectile dysfunction, {{the majority of cases}} can successfully <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> drugs such as Viagra. Importantly, the risk of erectile dysfunction after brachytherapy is less than after radical prostatectomy.|$|E

Bacterial infections <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> antibacterials (often called antibiotics) whereas fungal and viral infections <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> antifungals and antivirals respectively.

40|$|Ocimum gratissimum (OG) {{is known}} as a food spice and {{traditional}} herb, which has been recommended for the treatment of various diseases. To investigate the hepatoprotective effect of OG aqueous extract (OGAE), male Wistar rats challenged by carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) were used as the animal model of chronic hepatic injury.

5|$|Niobium-containing {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, {{but some are}} toxic and should <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> care. The short- and long-term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride, two chemicals that are water-soluble, have been tested in rats. Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a median lethal dose (LD50) between 10 and 100mg/kg. For oral administration the toxicity is lower; a study with rats yielded a LD50 after seven days of 940mg/kg.|$|E
