50|$|Domestic ducks {{can be kept}} as pets, in {{a garden}} or backyard, {{generally}} with a pond or deep water dish. If they are given access to a pond, they dabble in the mud, dredging out and eating wildlife and frog spawn, and swallow adult frogs and toads up {{to the size of}} the common frog Rana temporaria, as they have been bred to be much bigger than wild ducks, with a waterline length (<b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>neck</b> to base of tail) of up to 1 ft; the wild mallard's waterline length is about 6 in. Protection from predators such as foxes and hawks is required. Ducks are also kept for their ornamental value. Breeds have been developed with crests and tufts or striking plumage, for exhibition in competitions.|$|E
50|$|The adult plumage {{above is}} black and the wing coverts and tertials having silvery streaks along the shaft. The crown and neck are brown shading to black towards {{the back of the}} neck. The underparts are blackish brown. A pale line over the eye and throat and a line running along the sides of the neck gives it a striped appearance. The iris is white with a yellow ring (brighter yellow in {{breeding}} birds) around it. The tip of the upper mandible is dark while the base is pale brown bill while the lower mandible is yellowish. The legs and webbing on the foot are yellow in immatures and non-breeding birds while breeding birds have darker grey tarsi and toes with yellow webbing. The sexes are not easily distinguishable but males tend to have black speckles that coalesce on the white throat. Adult females have a shorter bill and tend to have the black at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>neck</b> and chest separated from the hind neck by a wide buff band that ends at the shoulder. This pattern however is also found in immatures whose neck is lighter and lack the long pointed scapulars. In flight the long and slender neck, wide wing and wedge shaped tail make it distinctive. Young birds have a pale brown neck and appear whitish on the underside and lack the white streak {{along the side of the}} neck. The inner secondaries or tertials and the central tail feathers appear wavy or corrugated. The tail is long and made up of twelve stiff feathers which are dragged along the ground when the bird attempts to walk or hop on land.|$|E

Patients {{were excluded from the}} analysis if there was uncertainty about factors such as the severity of the slip and the occurrence and/or type of reduction.

30|$|The {{treatment}} {{approach to}} the patient with symptomatic FAI secondary to malunited SCFE {{has focused on the}} proximal femur and remains controversial. Treatment strategies range from watchful waiting to surgical intervention which has included {{one or more of the}} following: arthroscopy, intertrochanteric osteotomy, surgical dislocation and osteochondroplasty, arthrodesis and total hip arthroplasty [13, 14]. Fabricant et al. [15] noted that treatment of FAI may have less benefit in patients with relative femoral retroversion. Several groups have demonstrated clinical improvement with intertrochanteric osteotomy and <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>neck</b> extra-capsular osteotomies [16, 17]. Surgical dislocation (or arthroscopy) with osteochondroplasty alone can be used to improve the head–neck offset and address chondrolabral lesions. However, the reported outcomes have focused on pain relief and improvement in femoral head-to-neck offset. Leunig et al. [18] advocated for simultaneous in situ pinning and osteochondroplasty of the head–neck junction to improve offset in mild SCFE deformities. However, this technique lacks the power to resolve the obligate out-toeing that is so often associated with severe slips and may not improve knee kinematics.|$|E
40|$|Background: Lipomas {{are common}} benign soft tissue tumors {{that are found}} rarely on the {{anterior}} part of the neck. Surgical interventions in these tumors are very challenging because of {{the proximity of the}} blood vessels and the vagus nerve and this knowledge of the anatomy and meticulous surgical technique are essential. Case presentation: A male patient of about 5 1 / 2 years old with a large asymptomatic mass, with which occupied the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>neck</b> involving the whole anterior part of the neck just like the crest of a turkey mimicking an hygroma, this require a total excision followed by reconstruction and drainage with two tubes. Conclusion: Giant pediculate lipom of the anterior neck just like the neck crest of a turkey mimicking an hygroma is an extremely rare case. The high resolution MRI provides an accurate cost effective preoperative investigation method. Surgical operation of this nature should be performed by an experienced surgeon and care should be taking to protect the carotid arteries the jugular vein and the vagus nerve...|$|E

40|$|Plexiform neurofibromas are one {{of several}} forms of neurofibromas based on gross and {{microscopic}} appearance that occur in von Recklinghausen's dis-ease. They are poorly circumscribed, diffuse en-largements of neural sheaths predominantly com-posed of Schwann cells that can become distorted into convoluted masses resembling a "bag of worms. " The tumors are locally invasive, are non-metastasizing, and are most commonly found {{in the head and}} neck region. 1 Retropharyngeal space (RPS) lesions are rare. The principal components of this space are lymph nodes and fat, with metastases being the most com-mon ne 0 plasms. 2 An extensive review of the world literature in English demonstrated few cases of neu-rofibromas involving the RPS, with no mention of any being plexiform.

40|$|Congenital subgaleal cysts {{over the}} {{anterior}} fontanelle in Nigerians. Eighteen cases of a congenital cystic swelling located over the anterior fontanelle {{are described in}} Nigerian patients who were otherwise clinically normal, There was a female: male ratio of 2 : 1. Radiologically and at operation, the cysts showed no evidence of intracranial connexion. Excision was curative. Of 14 cases which were histologically verified, all were dermoid cysts except one in which nerve tissue was present suggesting an encephalocele. Air cystography was the most useful diagnostic procedure. A congenital midline sincipital cystic swelling of the head inevitably arouses in the clinician's mind the possible existence of some form of meningo-encephalocele, or of herniation of brain substance or its enveloping membranes through a defect in the calvarium.
