5|$|A 2013 review {{said that}} there is enough {{suggestion}} of potential <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> ketogenic diets in cancer therapy that establishing clinical trials is probably warranted.

40|$|This paper models dynamic {{producer}} and consumer <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> improving habitat {{that supports the}} North Carolina blue crab fishery. It embeds two fishery management institutions—open access and partial rationalization—in a multispecies, two-patch spatial bioeconomic model with endogenous output price and estuarine eutrophication. Producer <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> improved environmental quality are higher for the rationalized fishery than for open access. Consumer benefits are larger than producer benefits and are comparable across institutions. However, the total <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> improving environmental quality are small relative to the <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> rationalizing the fishery and leaving environmental quality the same. ...|$|R

The studies utilised several different approaches to valuation and assessed different types of value. The Rakaia River study estimated recreational use benefits, the value of salmon management, and nonuse <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> protection of instream flows.

5|$|Once {{patients}} {{reach their}} teens, {{they need more}} specific information about pregnancy, birth control, self-esteem, and dating. Teenagers with lost or reduced genital sensation <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> education about alternative ways to experience pleasure and satisfaction from sexual acts. The teen years are often particularly difficult for those with SCI, in terms of body image and relationships. Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy, adolescents may experience humiliation when parents or caregivers bathe them or take care of bowel and bladder needs. They can <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> sexuality counseling, support groups, and mentoring by adults with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers. With the right care and education from family and professionals, injured children and adolescents can develop into sexually healthy adults.|$|E
