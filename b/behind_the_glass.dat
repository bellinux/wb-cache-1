5|$|Concerts {{performed}} by the Grant Park Orchestra and directed by Kalmar {{were part of a}} June 19, 2009, citywide Burnham Plan centennial celebration that included the unveiling of the Burnham Pavilion elsewhere in the park. The concert featured the world premiere of Michael Torke's work for symphony and chorus entitled Plans, paired with Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3. Also, the pavilion serves as host to the annual Chicago Winter Dance Festival. During the festival there is a month of free dance instructions <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> doors of the pavilion stage and free skating instruction at the McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink.|$|E

500|$|There {{are days}} when themed skating is {{encouraged}}. [...] Santa attire was encouraged on Saturday, December 13, 2008, and zombie attire was encouraged the next day, {{as part of an}} attempt to set a Guinness World Record for number of zombies on ice. [...] The rink also serves as a host to the annual Chicago Winter Dance Festival; during the festival there is a month of free skating instruction and demonstration at the rink, and there is free dance instructions <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> doors of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion stage.|$|E
500|$|The fountains use {{over one}} million LEDs. [...] The inner surface of each tower uses 147 smaller screens {{with a total of}} 264,480 LED points (each with two red, one blue and two green LEDs). The {{physical}} demands of LED screens, in particular the red, green, and blue long-life light bulbs and the requisite circuitry, created three major challenges: supporting the physical structure, combating heat buildup, and optimizing perceptibility of the display. [...] Plensa had used LED fixtures on previous projects, and thus had some experience with these issues. [...] The LED structure is not supported as a single wall (which would be [...] high), but rather as several segments that are noticeable as visible horizontal bands every few feet: these show where the LED equipment is supported. The heat generated is handled by fans that cool the air at the bottom, that then works its way through the chimney-like tower. Perceptibility was determined to be optimal with LED lights [...] <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
500|$|In the video, Lohan hides in the {{bathroom}} and prays a rosary as her parents, Michael and Dina (played by Drake Andrew and Victoria Hay, respectively), argue and fight in the living room. Her sister, Ali (who plays herself, according to Lohan), goes to her bedroom after coming home from ballet class, breaks into tears, saying a rosary. The three rooms are shown behind a department store window, outside which a crowd of observers form. At the end of the video, Lohan stands <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> and photographs of memories fly up onto it, from which she breaks out. As a response to the video, Lindsay's father {{wrote a letter to the}} New York Daily News, saying, [...] "while I always considered and expressed how truly blessed Lindsay, as well as my other children are, I never realized how blessed I am to have a daughter as amazing as Lindsay.

500|$|LEDs {{were chosen}} {{because they were}} viewed as the lowest {{maintenance}} option of the possible color changing fixtures. LEDs fit into an electrical circuit, causing illumination by the movement of electrons in the semiconductor material and making a filament unnecessary, so the bulbs never burn out and do not get too hot. [...] Fins {{were added to the}} screens to keep direct sunlight from hitting the LEDs. [...] Color Kinetics (now part of Philips Solid-State Lighting Solutions, which is now called Philips Color Kinetics) ColorBlast12 LEDs [...] fixtures are used to illuminate the tower structures and glass in an attempt to meet Plensa's objective that the towers have a light and translucent appearance, with their internal structures reflecting light from <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> surface. [...] The electronics were designed to be adaptable to the time of day, weather and season and to meet the desired century-long longevity and dependability objectives set by the design team in response to the thirty-year directive.|$|E

2500|$|The {{lighting}} {{design was}} done by Cline Bettridge Bernstein Lighting Design. Cira Centre's architects did not want any light fixtures protruding from the building so Cline Bettridge Bernstein decided to create a wall of light using LEDs. The 26W RGB LED fixtures are hidden in shadow boxes <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> curtain wall and are obscured during the day by the building's reflective glass. The LED lights are able to be changed color to create different patterns and effects on the building's facade. Designs used on the building include a large [...] "P" [...] for the Philadelphia Phillies. White 0.12W LED lights are also used in the lobby and building's elevators. In the lobby the white LEDs are mounted on the [...] tall wall that separates the lobby from the neighboring parking garage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{second major}} {{change to the}} memorial's design {{involved}} the glass walls and bronze artwork. Placed on {{the northern edge of}} the southern gingko tree grove, these four freestanding glass walls—now called [...] "Voices of Veterans"—would not only contain quotations and other inscriptions but also photo-realistic images of disabled veterans. Each glass [...] "wall" [...] consisted of 17 or 18 panels, with each panel [...] wide, [...] high, and [...] thick. A [...] gap between each panel permitted the movement of air. About 30 quotations would be used. The images would depict disabled veterans from the American Civil War to the present, although the quotations extended back to the American Revolutionary War. The number of rectangular bronze panels now numbered five, and they were to be placed behind some of the glass walls. These artworks passed light through to the glass walls as well as helped create a stronger visual element than glass alone. Trees in the grove would have their limbs removed up to a height of about [...] to provide visibility, and a planting bed about [...] deep <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> panels would discourage anyone from approaching them from behind. Kirkland said that as the bronze panels evolved, both veterans and DVLMF board members began questioning whether they effectively depicted the experiences of disabled veterans. It became clear that a more photo-realistic approach was needed, but this could only be accommodated by the glass panels. The designers realized that glass panels with only quotations was not dynamic enough, and that the bronze elements would help present the idealized elements that the photo-realistic images could not.|$|E
60|$|But Symon still said nothing. He was {{standing}} {{as still as}} a statue, and looking steadily at the black velvet <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> screen. He {{was looking at the}} black velvet because {{there was nothing else to}} look at. St. Paul's Penny was gone.|$|E

60|$|Christmas {{fell upon}} Monday of that year, 1769. There {{was to be}} a ball at Upper Marlboro on the Friday before, to which many of us were invited. Though the morning came in with a {{blinding}} snowstorm from the north, the first of that winter, about ten of the clock we set out from Annapolis an exceeding merry party, the ladies in four coaches-and-six, the gentlemen and their servants riding at the wheels. We laughed and joked despite the storm, and exchanged signals with <b>the</b> fair ones <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>glasses.</b>|$|R
60|$|David parted {{with the}} several {{articles}} named with a readiness {{that would have}} done great credit to his liberality, had he not certainly profited, in many particulars, by the exchange. Hawkeye was not long in assuming his borrowed garments; and when his restless eyes were hid <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>glasses,</b> and his head was surmounted by the triangular beaver, as their statures were not dissimilar, he might readily have passed for the singer by star-light. As soon as these dispositions were made, the scout turned to David, and gave him his parting instructions.|$|R

60|$|Because {{the ancients}} by some means {{discovered}} that the union of silica, lime, and soda made a perfectly transparent and hard substance it by no means follows that {{they knew how to}} make looking-glasses For this requires something <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> to throw back the image.

60|$|Mr. Pilkington seemed nervous but determined. His {{face was}} half {{hidden by the}} silk scarf that muffled his throat, for he was careful of his health and had a fancied {{tendency}} to bronchial trouble.
