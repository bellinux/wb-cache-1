5|$|Breckinridge {{ordered his}} field {{officers}} {{to inspect the}} troops and to report <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> condition of his troops.

Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece. With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman's troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon, there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future.|$|E
