5|$|Beginning in 1619, {{the ethnic}} Manchu Qing dynasty forced all men in China {{to adopt the}} queue: a long braid down the <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hair near the {{forehead}} completely shaved.

5|$|Breckinridge {{ordered his}} field {{officers}} {{to inspect the}} troops and to report <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> condition of his troops.

Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece. With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman's troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon, there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future.|$|E
