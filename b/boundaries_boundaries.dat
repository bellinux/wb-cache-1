Boundaries reveal a society through their construction, destruction, and definition of space. Because borders are demonstrated through anecdote, I examine boundaries largely through ethnography, exploring four specific types of boundaries and spaces: physical-political <b>boundaries,</b> <b>boundaries</b> based on cultural identity, gendered spaces, and heterotopias.

We apply a multigrid method to the Jacobi solver when solving the Poisson {{pressure}} equation, supporting internal <b>boundaries.</b> <b>Boundaries</b> are handled on the coarse levels, ensuring that boundaries will never vanish after restriction. We demonstrate cases where the multigrid solver computes results up to three times more accurate than the standard Jacobi method within the same time. Providing rich visual details and flows closer to widely accepted standards in fire engineering. Making accurate interactive physical simulation for engineering purposes, has the benefit of reducing production turn-around time. We have measured speed-up improvements by a factor of up to 350, compared to existing CPU-based solvers. The present CUDA-based solver promises huge potential in economical benefits, as well as constructions of safer and more complex buildings. In this paper, the multigrid method is applied to fire engineering. However, this is not a limitation, since improvements are possible for other fields as well.

40|$|Physics envy ” is the {{condition}} where non-physicists attempt to model their discipline after physics {{in the hope}} of gaining credibility. This ailment is not uncommon among engineers and its negative impact is most strongly felt in engineering design. Biology offers some insights into this phenomenon for it, too, suffers from “physics envy ” but has the luxury of a strong philosophical base to draw on. Much of what separates engineering and biology from physics can be attributed to a preoccupation with function. Within the paradigm of physics, however, function is a foreign concept. We can ponder the function of a human organ or a mechanical part, but the entities of physics, such as atoms, have no functions, only effects. Function implies the possibility of failure, such as a heart failure or a mechanical breakdown, but atoms never fail; they simply are. Function speaks of systems which cannot be contained within spatiotemporal <b>boundaries,</b> <b>boundaries</b> which physics cannot transgress. “Physics envy ” therefore serves to undermine research and practice in engineering design. 1...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{consider}} technology-related changes in psychological needs and boundaries that affect one’s personal adaptation to the info-communication society, as well as how they relate to problematic or excessive technology use. Based on the psychological model of the consequences of technology use, we’ve picked two forms of technology use (one related to mobile phones and the other related to the Internet) from a revised version of our Technology-Related Psychological Consequences Questionnaire. The new version includes nine questions: two assessing the excessive use of technology (the inability to resist using technology and subjective dependence), four assessing changes in psychological <b>boundaries</b> (<b>boundaries</b> extension and violation, easiness-related and opportunity-related preference for technology) and the other three measuring technology-related needs (functionality, convenience and image making).

40|$|The {{psychological}} {{boundaries that}} people cognitively establish are analyzed {{in this paper}} as influencing perceptions and thinking about national boundaries. The boundaries concept in psychology refers to how people establish different groups that they use in their thinking.

Social identify theory is explained as significant in revising boundaries as ICT empowers people.

As ICT messages with more media richness, the influences to change how boundaries are cognitized is increasing. Several cognitive mechanism are identified as causing definition of psychological boundaries. First, the paper discusses how the vast amounts of information available on the Internet is adequate to allow redefining boundaries. Second, strong group identifiers and weak group identifiers are discussed as influencing emerging boundaries. Third, how low status people react to ICT is presented as a cognitiv...|$|E

40|$|Too big to fail" and "systemically important" are catch phrases {{in current}} {{debates about the}} {{relation}} between democracy and the market economy. It is characteristic of this relation that certain questions do not even enter the political agenda {{partly because of the}} size of economic agents. For key actors in the financial sector like big banks or pension funds are what has been referred to as "too big to fail" or "systemically important", meaning that their behavior can pose a long-term threat to the economic system. Contrary to neoliberal theory, these actors are unable to establish a regulatory regime for guaranteeing the collective good of a functioning financial market system. Unlike a democratic state, they are not "systemically important", meaning "being important for the preservation of a system’s functions". A democratic state’s capacity to rescue financial institutions by levying taxes depends on the loyalty of the citizens. In order to secure this systemically important civic loyalty, it is necessary to limit the role of citizens as economic actors.

In chapter 2 I set forth the main features of boundaries and I argue that things depend upon their boundaries, contrary to the mainstream view. In chapter 3 I face the problem of contact, i. e. the problem of how two discrete things can touch each other. I argue that things can never keep in touch, whatever the structure of space is. In part two I defend the thesis according to which every boundary is of the fiat sort, i. e. it is mind independent. In chapter 4 I argue against bona fide boundaries, i. e. boundaries mind dependent. In chapter 5 I set forth a taxonomy of the various kinds of fiat boundaries in order to developing in details a general model of explanation of the fictional nature of boundaries and therefore of things. In part three I show how fiat boundaries can be adopted by urban planners for their different purposes...|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} {{model for}} droplet combustion {{predicts that the}} square of the droplet diameter decreases linearly with time. It also predicts that a droplet of any size will burn to completion over a period of time. However, it has been known for some time that under certain conditions flames surrounding a droplet, in a quiescent environment, could extinguish because of insufficient residence time for the chemistry to proceed to completion. This type of extinction that occurs for smaller droplets has been studied extensively in the past. Large droplets, on the other hand, exhibit a different type of extinction where excessive radiative heat loss from the flame zone leads to extinction. This mode of "radiative extinction" was theoretically predicted for droplet burning by Chao et al. and was observed in recent space experiments in a quiescent environment. Thus far, the fundamental flammability limit prescribed by radiative extinction of liquid droplets has been measured only under quiescent environmental conditions. In many space platforms, however, ventilation systems produce small convective flows and understanding of the influences of this convection on the extinction process will help better define the radiative extinction flammability <b>boundaries.</b> <b>Boundaries</b> defined by experiments and captured using theoretical models could provide enhanced fire safety margin in space explor 1999063 d investigation of convective effects will help in interpretations of burning-rate data obtained during free-floated droplet combustion experiments with small residual velocities...|$|E
