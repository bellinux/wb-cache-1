40|$|In {{the central}} North Sea Basin hydrocarbon-bearing chalks are deeply buried (2 - 3 km) whereas chalks {{in the rim}} areas are {{cropping}} out in the surrounding countries. The differing diagenetic histories between <b>buried</b> and <b>outcrop</b> chalk result in different rock properties, which are of great importance when simulating reservoir conditions using outcrop chalks as models. In general, deeply buried reservoir chalks show significant overgrowth as witnessed by reshaping of particles together with strengthening of particle contacts. Most outcrop chalks are moderately affected with looser interparticle connections and less altered particle shapes. The non-carbonate mineralogy of outcrop chalks is dominated by quartz, occasionally opal-CT and clinoptilolite, and the clay mineral smectite. In offshore chalks quartz still dominates; opal-CT has recrystallized into submicron-size quartz crystals, and smectite {{has been replaced by}} kaolinite. These diagenetic variations are explained by higher temperatures and pressures in the deeply buried reservoir chalks...|$|R

Drilling in Jackson Hole found the same formation 24,000 feet (7,300 m) below the valley's surface, indicating that the two blocks have been displaced 30,000 feet (9,100 m) from each other. Thus an average of one foot of movement occurred every 300 years (1cm per year on average).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the geological, biological and oceanographical environment of coral banks in the Porcupine Seabight. The study area is characterised by well delimited geographic clusters of coral banks, each characterized by their typical bank morphology and environmental setting. In the central part two mound provinces are recognised: complex flat topped seafloor mounds in the 'Hovland mound province', and a large number of smaller N-S elongated buried mounds in the 'Magellan mound province'. Along the eastern margin of the basin partly <b>buried</b> and <b>outcropping</b> mounds form the 'Belgica mound province'. The banks are mound-shaped elevations, hosting living deepwater coral (Lophelia sp., Madrepora sp., Desmophyllum sp., Dendrophylla sp.) and associated fauna. This biological active layer covers a dead assemblage of corals clogged with mud. Endogenic and exogenic environmental parameters are evaluated in time and related to the geomorphological response of the banks. All coral banks, <b>buried</b> or <b>outcropping,</b> occur in association with current-induced features (e. g., scouring features, dunes) and steep palaeo and present seabed slopes. Only a few banks are outcropping in the present setting which suggests that environmental conditions were more favourable for bank development in the past. The depth range of these outcropping mounds coincides with the top of the dense Mediterranean OutflowWater, where current enhancement may control the coral distribution not only nowadays but also in the initial phase of coral bank development. The distribution of corals in the southeastern North Atlantic and the actual link with Mediterranean water suggest a possible migration of corals within the Mediterranean water into the Atlantic. The startup phase of coral bank development in Porcupine Seabight was simultaneous for all provinces, after a Late Pliocene period of erosion and non-deposition. Sediment stress time variations, largely controlled by currents, {{play an important role in}} bank development. Coral banks accrete by active baffling of sediment by the biological framework and extension of the biological cap (catch-up phase). Once this fragile system between sedimentation and biological growth is out of balance, the framework will progressively be clogged with sediment (keep-up phase). Once sediment dominates the structure the coral banks get buried and draped by sediment (give-up phase) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Measuring surface {{heat flow}} at the Hikurangi Trough is key toward characterizing the local thermal {{regime and the}} {{influence}} of thermally sensitive processes such as fluid flow and slow slip. Marine heat flow data were collected during May– June 2015 in the northern Hikurangi Trough at sites seaward and landward of the deformation front, giving mean and one standard deviation values of 58 ± 16 and 46 ± 15 mW m⁻² respectively. A 3. 5 m violin-bow style probe was used to measure thermal conductivity and temperature gradient of the seafloor, and heat flow is calculated using Fourier’s law. Two-dimensional steady-state, finite element modeling was undertaken to analyze the influence of subduction parameters on surface heat flow and temperature along the subduction thrust. Heat flow values seaward of the deformation front {{have been found to be}} sensitive to the structure of <b>buried</b> and <b>outcropping</b> extrusive crust, but the mean heat flow is within the range of expected values for lithosphere this age (120 Myr) according to the GDH 1 cooling model. Landward of the deformation front, measured heat flow is in excess of preferred modeled values. I interpret these observations as evidence for fluid flow within a crustal aquifer system and through splay faults within the forearc. A heat flow discontinuity of 40 mW m⁻² landward of the deformation front supports the presence of compaction sourced fluid along the subduction thrust, which is consistent with previous evidence for excess pore pressure and the occurrence of shallow slow slip...|$|R
40|$|Beachrocks {{are hard}} coastal {{sedimentary}} formations consisting of various beach sediments, lithified through {{the precipitation of}} carbonate cements. The objectives of this contribution are to (a) collate and review information on the reported occurrences, characteristics and formation mechanisms of beachrocks and (b) consider their impacts on the coastal zone. The analysis of the available information has shown that (a) beachrock formation is a global and diachronic phenomenon and (b) {{the great majority of}} beachrocks are found in tropical/subtropical and low temperate latitude, microtidal coasts. The cementing agents of beachrocks are composed predominantly of the metastable carbonate phases High Magnesian Calcite (HMC) and Aragonite (Ar), appearing in a diverse crystalline morphology. It has been suggested that cement precipitation in the coastal environment is controlled by: (i) the physicochemical conditions; (ii) the presence of organic compounds and microbes; (iii) the magnitude and distribution of the wave energy along the coast; and (iv) the textural characteristics of the constituent sediments. Various theories have been proposed to explain beachrock formation itself, linking the phenomenon to either physicochemical or biological processes. These theories, however, {{do not seem to be}} of universal validity and acceptance, as each is able to explain only some of the reported occurrences. The presence of beachrocks appears to affect beach morphodynamics by: (i) ‘locking’ the beach profile; (ii) modifying the nearshore hydrodynamics; (iii) changing the porous character of the beach and, thus, its response to wave forcing; and (iv) differential bed erosion at the margins of the beachrock outcrops that can alter significantly the long- and, particularly, the cross-shore sediment transport. Therefore, although relict submerged beachrock outcrops may provide some coastal protection by reducing the wave energy impinging onto the coastline, modern beachrocks may promote offshore loss of unconsolidated beach sediments and <b>buried</b> beachrock <b>outcropping.</b> Finally, the presence of beachrocks may have also significant ecological impacts, as the indigenous (mobile substrate) fauna and flora of the beach is replaced by hard substrate benthic assemblages, which are commonly arranged in hydrodynamically-controlled zones...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{architecture of}} peninsular Italy {{is dominated by}} the Apennine mountain belt thrust over the Adriatic-Apulia foreland. In the southern Apennines most of the major seismicity gathers into a narrow ribbon stretched along the axis of the chain (Gruppo di Lavoro CPTI, 1999; Boschi et al., 2000). Large NW-SE trending seismogenic faults affect the uppermost 15 km of the crust with almost purely extensional kinematics (for a summary and review see: Valensise and Pantosti, 2001 and references therein). Northeast of the chain axis and up to the Apulia foreland, seismicity is often deeper than 15 km and mainly occurs on right-lateral E-W trending fault planes (Del Gaudio, 2001; Di Bucci and Mazzoli, 2003; Valensise et al., 2004; Fig. 1). The Gargano Promontory and – further to the East – the central Adriatic Sea are also punctuated by reverse faulting earthquakes on E-W trending planes (Vannucci et al., 2004). On land, historical earthquakes roughly concentrate within three distinct E-W running belts (Fig. 1), the northernmost of which includes the Mattinata Fault – a well documented strike-slip fault (Favali et al., 1993 a, b) that today exhibits right-lateral motion and active deformation (Piccardi, 1998; Chilovi et al., 2000). The damage patterns of these earthquakes are often stretched in an E-W fashion, which further suggests the activation of E-W seismogenic sources. Our goal is to gain insight on the current dynamics of this region and contribute to identify the sources of the largest earthquakes (M> 5. 5). To this end, we adopted a multidisciplinary approach that integrates the analysis of seismological data (historical and instrumental) with surface and subsurface geological data (geomorphology, structural geology, field geological survey, analyses of deep well logs and seismic reflection lines). We find that seismogenic structures in our study area originate at different depths and cut through the crust with two different mechanisms (Fig. 2) : shallow, NW-SE oriented normal faulting within the Apennine chain and deeper E-W dextral strike-slip in the <b>buried</b> and <b>outcropping</b> Apulia foreland...|$|R
40|$|The roadcut on highway 412 near Pedro, Benton County, Arkansas (MArkUP site L 15), {{has been}} of {{geological}} interest since its excavation in the 1980 s. The roadcut is located within the Springfield Plateau and displays formations of Lower Mississippian age. The roadcut contains three mound-like features believed to be olistoliths. This thesis research work adds geophysical evidence to the geological exposure at the site. The purpose {{of this research is}} to answer the question of whether near surface seismic methods can be used to extend information at the Pedro outcrop below the ground surface. Specifically, can the top of the Middle Ordovician Everton contact be identified? Seismic experiments were conducted by the University of Arkansas MArkUP team, investigating parts of the Middle Ordovician through Lower Mississippian succession, using a 48 -channel Geode seismograph, sledge hammer source, and seismic acquisition software. Interpretation of P-wave refraction events estimate that the top of the Middle Ordovician Everton occurs 69 feet below the natural ground surface {{from the top of the}} Pedro outcrop at the location of the largest mound, or approximately 31 feet below the surface of the base of the roadcut. Estimation of the Chattanooga-Everton contact involved data acquisition, processing to reduce noise, first arrival event picking and manual inversion to estimate layer depths and velocities. Ray Trace modeling confirmed inversion results and local stratigraphy was found to be consistent. The value of this study demonstrates that shallow seismic data can estimate <b>buried</b> contacts below <b>outcrops</b> and extend geological knowledge in northwest Arkansas...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} geological, geophysical {{and remote}} sensing survey was undertaken {{as part of}} the construction of a high-resolution 3 D model of the shallow subsurface geology of part of the Trent Valley in Nottinghamshire, UK. The 3 D model was created using the GSI 3 D software package and the geophysical techniques used included ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and automated resistivity profiling. In addition, the remote sensing techniques of light detection and ranging (LIDAR) and airborne thematic mapping (ATM) were used. The objective {{of the study was to}} assess the contribution of these techniques to improve the geological mapping and interpretation of terrace deposits and other geological features. The study site had an area of ~ 2 km 2 and consisted of a Triassic mudstone escarpment, overlain first by a sand and gravel river terrace that extended to the modern floodplain of the River Trent. Automated resistivity profiling mapping proved to be the central tool in identifying and positioning geological features at a greater resolution than would be obtained through traditional geological mapping and borehole observation. These features included i) a buried cliff delineating the south-eastern limits of the incised Trent valley, ii) siltstone beds within the Gunthorpe Member of the Mercia Mudstone Group and iii) the variability of the sediments within the river terrace. A long ERT transect across the site successfully imaged the <b>buried</b> cliff and <b>outcropping</b> siltstone beds on the escarpment. Combined ERT and GPR transects revealed the depth of the sand and gravel deposits (Holme Pierrepont sands and gravels), whilst the GPR provided information about the depositional environment. Remote sensing using light detection and ranging proved essential in the original geological survey because it confirmed the absence of a second river terrace that had been previously thought to exist. This case study demonstrates the importance of combining geophysical techniques with traditional geological survey and borehole analysis, in order to create high-resolution 3 D geological models, which are increasingly being used as a platform to understand and solve environmental problems...|$|R
40|$|The Sabie River, {{located within}} the {{semi-arid}} savanna of South Africa, experienced a ∼ 100 -year return interval flood in 2000, providing {{a rare opportunity to}} quantify the resultant pattern and consequence of woody debris piles for riparian areas. Biophysical attributes of rivers in arid and semi-arid regions differ strongly from those in mesic regions, but differences in the role and dynamics of woody debris remain largely unknown. Our primary goal was to determine the basic ecology and distribution of wood piles formed by a large infrequent flood in a bedrock-confined river. In particular, we sought to determine the mechanism of pile formation, their position, size, and structural attributes of piles as well as regeneration from resprouting and seedling recruitment within piles in different channel types. We observed relatively distinct patterns of distribution and mechanisms of formation in 421 piles and provide a description of the distribution, abundance and short-term fate of each pile type. Patterns of wood accumulation were largely controlled by characteristics of the trapping sites, particularly toppled trees that remain rooted in their growth location. In general, wood was primarily strewn against toppled, transported and standing trees, though several large piles formed on bedrock <b>outcrops.</b> <b>Buried</b> piles were also discovered upon excavation of depositional features (alluvial mounds). Resprouting of toppled trees with intact roots and living tissues was the dominant mode of vegetation reestablishment in the piles. We observed resprouting in 36 % of piles surveyed. Resprouting piles were most common (48 %) in the seasonally inundated portion of the macro-channel. Tree seedlings were recorded in 28 % of the piles. The flood appeared to create heterogeneity in the establishment of new woody vegetation by forming distinct wood piles from the ruins of the previous riparian forest. Even though the input of wood to semi-arid rivers appears to be a fairly rare occurrence and wood piles are rapidly depleted by decay and fire, we expect their influence will be long-lived, preserved in the pattern of vegetation establishment and alluvial mounds within the macro-channel...|$|R
40|$|Dolomitization is {{undoubtedly}} the most intensively studied diagenetic process in carbonate rocks. It can induce porosity and permeability changes {{resulting from a}} complex interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, which together with the variety of dolomitizing fluid circulation schemes, makes the prediction of the dolomite geometric distribution and of petrophysical features very challenging. In Southern Italy the dolomitization processes and the induced porosity/permeability changes have never been investigated in detail. Only the Upper Triassic interval of the Apenninic carbonate platform succession outcropping on the Monti Lattari Belt (Southern Apennines) has been studied by Iannace (1991) and Iannace & Frisia (1994), which demonstrated a fundamental difference in dolomitization style between Norian and Rhaetian-Lower Jurassic successions. The present research aims to a detailed genetical and petrophysical characterization of the dolomitized bodies outcropping along the Monti Lattari belt from the Lower Jurassic to the Lower Cretaceous. The goal was to complete {{the study of the}} dolomitization processes along the carbonate succession of the Monti Lattari belt, started by Iannace (1991), and to furnish also a complete characterization of the petrophysical properties of the observed different types of dolomites. The research approach was to combine detailed sampling and analysis of well exposed outcrops along road cuts and quarries with a large scale reconstruction along a transect showing platform domains alternating with intraplatform basins. The workflow has been the following: •	Field work including geometric and stratigraphic observations and sampling. •	Petrographic analysis of dolomite types and their porosity (Optical microscopy, SEM and catodoluminescence analyses). •	Geochemical analyses on the separate dolomite phases (O, C, and Sr, trace elements, Ca% and fluid inclusions). •	 Petrophysical analyses including: Helium-porosimetry, Petrographyc and Digital Image Analysis, Mercury Injection porosimetry, Nitrogen Permeability and Sonic Velocity. The field study and the petrographic analyses have shown that the Lower-Middle Jurassic stratigraphic interval mainly consists of a widespread massive dolomite which irregularly replace the carbonate bodies in the Liassic interval and only partially replaces the Dogger facies. This dolomite (called Dolomite 2), which affects also the Rhaetian portion of the succession, is made of coarse crystals with both planar-s and planar-e mosaic with low porosities and permeability. Its occurrence and geometry, together with the light oxygen isotopes signature and the Mg/Ca ratio close to the stochiometry, allow to ascribe this dolomite to a late diagenetic event related to a large scale circulation of marine fluids through the Jurassic carbonate platform driven by thermal convection. In this stratigraphic interval also another type of dolomite has been locally recognized (Dolomite 1). It consists of fine grained crystals with a very low porosity which only partially replace the carbonate bodies. It shows sedimentary structures which indicate, together with the stable isotopes results and the XRD data, a very early diagenetic process, likely related to reflux and tidal pumping mechanisms of fluid circulation. At last, a third type of dolomite (saddle type dolomite, called Dolomite 3) followed by precipitation of poikilotopic calcite has been discriminated. These last two diagenetic phases are concentrated along faults and fracture systems and their oxygen isotopes in addition to the fluid inclusions results, allow to relate them to a precipitation from warm fluids (about 130 °C) raised along extensional faults during a very late stage of diagenesis. The Lower-Middle Cretaceous interval has been studied, in cooperation with Shell, because considered as possible analogue of Val D’Agri reservoirs. In fact, the high similarities between the most productive intervals of the Apulian Platform (Cretaceous in age) and the coeval rocks outcropping in the Apenninic Platform (Monti Lattari belt), allow the characterization of <b>buried</b> bodies via <b>outcropping</b> facies. This interval consists of partially dolomitized bodies, usually stratiform, alternated with low porosity micritic carbonates. Petrographically, it has been possible to distinguish two main different types of dolomites: Dolomite A made of fine crystals (10 to 50 µm) with a low porosity mosaic and Dolomite B made of coarse crystals (70 to 130 µm) with both a tight mosaic and a more porous one (planar-s and planar-e respectively). They are Ca enriched and have positive oxygen isotopes data which indicate an early diagenesis from a normal marine water. The invoked processes for their formation are a capillary rising of fluids in an evaporitic setting, for Dolomite A and a reflux of slightly saline water for Dolomite B. Finally, also in this stratigraphic interval, a third less abundant type of dolomite has been distinguished: Dolomite C (saddle type) followed by precipitation of poikilotopic calcite. Again, these last two diagenetic phases are concentrated along fractures and fault systems and can be related to warm fluids (130 °C, as indicated by fluid inclusion microthermometry), raised along extensional faults. As a consequence, considering the similarity with the Jurassic, and also with some Raethian samples collected by Iannace (1991), these two last diagenetic phases can be ascribed to a unique late diagenetic event that is the rising of warm fluids along the extensional Neogenic faults, which represent the last tectonic phase affectiong the Apenninic fold and thrust belt. From a petrophysical point of view, the dolomites belonging to the two analyzed intervals show very low porosity values. The integration of petrophysics and petrography, show that the main factor affecting the porosity and permeability values is the crystal size and packing which is strictly related to the limestone precursor facies. In fact, both in the Jurassic and in the Cretaceous, the presence of two different textures (Planar-e and s), due to the facies variations of the host rock, strongly drives the porosity differences. As a result, considering an hypothetical hydrocarbon reservoir, both for the Jurassic and for the Cretaceous, the potential permeable horizons could have represented by the layers with the more porous Planar-e mosaic. Finally, {{in order to have a}} complete petrophysical characterization of the sampled dolomites, a detailed study on sonic velocity variations has been carried out. The investigation, aimed to analyze the influence of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters on the sonic velocity variations in low porosity dolomites, involved the characterization of dolomites coming from the same succession but having different stratigraphic heights (Cretaceous and Jurassic from the Apenninic Platform, sharing the same burial and tectonic history) and also of dolomites having the same age but coming from two domains with different burial history (Cretaceous dolomites from the Apenninic and Apulia Platform). The main result of this part of the study has been that, in low porosity dolomites (< 10 %), the factors affecting the sonic velocity propagation drastically reduce. As a consequence, pore types and mostly crystals size result to be the main controlling factors on the sonic velocity variations. In conclusion, the data collected in this PhD thesis, together with the previous studies on the Sorrento Peninsula and on the Tethyan domain, demonstrate that there is a stratigraphic control on the observed different types of dolomites in terms of geometry, petrography and geochemistry. This control appears to be related to the different impact that surface-related, climatic controlled diagenesis and subsurface late diagenetic processes had in the different moments of the Mesozoic. The Norian and the Cretaceous appear as time favorable to the formation of early dolomites. On the other hand, the Rhaetian and the Lower-Middle Jurassic were times characterized by widespread fluid circulation episodes took place during the Jurassic and leaded to the formation of large discordant bodies of coarse grained dolomites. These processes have been active not only in the Lattari Mountain platform but likely affected also other platform domains of Apennines and Alps...|$|R
