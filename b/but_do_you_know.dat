500|$|In an {{interview}} with io9 on 28 July 2009, creator Russell T Davies {{was asked about the}} controversy surrounding Ianto's death and the fan reaction campaign. He replied [...] "There's a campaign, because he was a coffee boy. <b>But</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how many packets of coffee they've received so far? Nine. So I think people writing online might sound like thousands of people, but they are nine." [...] However, those involved in the movement believe that this number is much higher due to a post tallying the coffee sent within the community. When asked about the backlash in a separate interview with Michael Ausiello, Russell T Davies said [...] "It's not particularly a backlash. What's actually happening is, well, nothing really to be honest. It's a few people posting online and getting fans upset". He also stated that the character was gone for good, and that his resurrection would devalue the [...] "entire plot." [...] He recommended that fans who wish to stop watching the show should watch Supernatural [...] "because those boys are beautiful", or [...] "look at poetry" [...] if they [...] "can't handle drama". Following these statements, the Save Ianto Jones website encouraged fans to contact BBC Wales rather than Davies, and temporarily presented on its front page the message [...] "Mr Davies has made it clear in recent interviews that he views his fans with contempt, and as disposable, which saddens us" [...] and asked not to be [...] "abused". At Comic-Con 2009, a fan claimed that Davies [...] "hurt" [...] a lot of internet fans with his decision to kill Ianto, which she called [...] "out of line." [...] Davies replied that he would not change his mind regarding the decision, adding, [...] "I've got to be blunt about this, there have been campaigns to send packets of coffee to BBC Wales in protest. There have been nine packets sent. I'm not taking the mickey, but that's a very small number." [...] Executive producer Julie Gardner stated [...] "We want people to be engaged, discuss and not always agree with us. At the end of the day, I make drama to support each author's vision. It's not a democracy. Whether people like it or not, it's storytelling." [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek has criticised the Internet campaigns to resurrect the character, citing that the show would [...] "lose far more credibility" [...] if he were brought back. Brew also expressed doubt that the fans stating they would boycott a fourth series will do so. He summarised: [...] "Torchwood now needs to continue to have the courage of its convictions, and for that to happen, the reset switch simply isn't an option." ...|$|E
