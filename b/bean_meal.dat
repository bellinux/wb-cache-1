Since they are frequently consumed with rice, the Glycemic responses of the two forms of Moong Bean, Whole Moong (WM) and Dehusked Moong (DM), alone and each with rice, WMR and DMR, respectively, were studied among 10 Type II Diabetic subjects. Each bean and bean plus rice portion was weighed to provide a total of 50 g carbohydrate, the latter in 50 : 50 proportion. Each portion was cooked and flavored with spices sauteed in 2 teaspoons of corn oil. The 10 Type II Diabetic subjects, 5 male and 5 female, were in the age range of 41 to 71 years. Six subjects were maintained with diet alone and 4 subjects were maintained with hypoglycemic agents in addition to diet. Each subject underwent a 2 -hour glucose tolerance test with 50 g oral glucose load. At intervals of one week, each subject then consumed each of the five diets. Capillary blood obtained under standard fasting conditions, and every 15 minutes after each meal for the first hour and every 30 minutes for the second hour, was analyzed for glucose, using the Ames Glucometer. Two sets of glycemic indexes (GI's) using glucose and bread as standard were calculated for all meals. Mean GI's for <b>bean</b> <b>meals</b> alone were not significantly different (WM = 32. 1 ± 3. 9 and DM = 33. 0 ± 6. 4). Addition of rice to moong <b>bean</b> <b>meals</b> significantly raised the GI's of both means (WMR - 45. 5 ± 3. 9 and DMR = 42. 6 ± 6. 9). The GI of white bread was 55. 8 ± 4. 5 and the GI values of all 4 moong <b>bean</b> <b>meals</b> using bread as standard were significantly higher compared to the GI values using glucose as standard (WM = 58. 7 ± 5. 5, DM = 60. 9 ± 12. 5 and WMR = 78. 9 ± 8. 7, DMR = 77. 6 ± 4. 0).

Where soya <b>bean</b> <b>meal</b> was included it replaced 0. 2 kg/day (low) or 0. 4 kg/day (high) of MSBP or barley. The duration of the treatments was 125 days (winter) after which the animals grazed together for 148 days. Silage intake decreased linearly (P < 0. 001) with increasing MSBP level. Addition of soya <b>bean</b> <b>meal</b> had no effect on silage intake with low MSBP or barley but increased (P < 0. 05) intake with high MSBP. Live-weight gain increased both linearly (P < 0. 001) and quadratically (P < 0. 01) with increasing MSBP. There was a significant live-weight response to the addition of soya <b>bean</b> <b>meal</b> which was greater at the high than at the low MSBP level and was greater for MSBP than barley.

40|$|Background: Iron {{deficiency}} is a {{major health}} problem worldwide, and is associated with diets of low iron bioavailability. Non-heme iron absorption is modulated by dietary constituents, {{one of which is}} the so-called >meat factor>, present in meat, fish (oily and lean) and poultry, which is an important enhancer of iron absorption in humans. Food processing also affects iron bioavailability. Objective: To evaluate the effect of consuming sous vide cooked salmon fish on non-heme iron bioavailability from a <b>bean</b> <b>meal,</b> rich in phytate, in iron-deficient women. Design: Randomized crossover trial in 21 young women with low iron stores (ferritin < 30 μg/L). Two test meals were extrinsically labelled with stable isotopes of iron (Fe- 57 or Fe- 58). Iron bioavailability was measured as the incorporation of stable isotopes into erythrocytes 14 d after meals consumption. Results: The addition of fish to the <b>bean</b> <b>meal</b> significantly increased (p < 0. 001) iron absorption. Serum ferritin concentration and iron absorption were inversely correlated for both the <b>bean</b> <b>meal</b> (R 2 = 0. 294, p = 0. 011) and the fish and <b>bean</b> <b>meal</b> (R 2 = 0. 401, p = 0. 002).

[URL] {{study on the}} use of quebracho tannins as chemical additives was carried out at the Spanish Council for Scientific Research, Leon, Spain during 1998 by conducting two experiments. In the first experiment, three ruminally cannulated ewes were used to determine in situ degradability of soya <b>bean</b> <b>meals</b> (SBM) treated with different doses of quebracho tannin. Samples were prepared by spraying 100 g SBM with 100 ml distilled water containing 0, 1, 5, 10, 15 or 25 g of commercial quebracho powder (S- 0, S-Q 1, S-Q 2, S-Q 3, and S-Q 5, respectively). Intestinal digestibility of non-degradable protein was estimated in vitro. The rapidly degradable protein fraction of all quebracho treated soya <b>bean</b> <b>meals</b> was different (P < 0. 05) from the non-treated SBM (S- 0 : 0. 154), with values ranging from 0. 032 to 0. 133. S-Q 4 and S-Q 5 showed lower fractional rates of degradation of the protein than S- 0 (0. 042 and 0. 046 v. 0. 082, respectively). By contrast, in vitro digestibility of the non-degradable protein was not significantly affected by the treatments imposed, with the exception of treatment with the highest dose of quebracho tannin in which intestinal digestion was reduced (0. 939 v. 0. 826 for S- 0 and S-Q 5, respectively. P < 0. 05). In the second experiment, ten ruminally cannulated ewes were used to examine the effect of a daily dosing of quebracho tannin into the rumen on the degradation of the quebracho-treated SBM. Long-term dosing of quebracho tannin did not increase the ability of the rumen microbes to degrade tannin treated SBM. It was therefore concluded that quebracho tannins could be used as chemical additives for improving the digestive utilization of protein-rich feeds in sheep.

Three diets were formulated. Diet 1 was the basal diet and contained 120 g kg− 1 SBM while diets 2 and 3 contained 120 g kg− 1 HMBM and RMBM, respectively in place of SBM. Each diet had 3 groups of 12 birds each. Feed intake, FCR and weight gain in birds on the RMBM and HMBM diets were significantly (p < 0. 05) depressed compared to birds on the SBM diet at the starter phase {{but not at the}} finisher phase for the HMBM diet but at both phases for the RMBM diet. The packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell count (RBC) and white blood cells (WBC) were significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced in the RMBM diets compared to the other 2 diets. Histopathological results showed that birds on the RMBM diet showed severe and widespread vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of the hepatocytes, interstitial congestion, tubula...|$|R
