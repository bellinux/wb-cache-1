25|$|In 1990, Telecom {{was sold}} to two United States-based {{telecommunications}} companies, <b>Bell</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and Ameritech, for NZ$4.25 billion. Around the same time, the Kiwi Share agreement was drawn up, which included a provision that the company retained free local calling for residential customers. Also in 1990, Clear Communications (later TelstraClear) entered the New Zealand telecommunications market {{and so was the}} first network to compete with Telecom.|$|E
25|$|According to {{historian}} Willys I. Peck, the Los Gatos Telephone Company was {{the first}} company to offer telephone service in town. Later, the Western California Telephone Company provided service to Los Gatos and to Novato, Morgan Hill, and Kenwood. In the 1970s, the utility was acquired by General Telephone and Electronics, which {{changed its name to}} GTE, and merged with <b>Bell</b> <b>Atlantic</b> in 2000 to become Verizon Communications. Verizon still serves these four areas.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Telecom {{listed on}} the New Zealand, Australian and New York stock exchanges. The {{following}} year Telecom implemented a NZ$200 million fibre-optic cable connection between Australia and New Zealand. Also in this year, Roderick Deane was appointed CEO of the company. Then in 1993 Ameritech and <b>Bell</b> <b>Atlantic</b> reduced their share in Telecom to a combined 49.6% and BellSouth New Zealand Limited (BellSouth), subsequently acquired by Vodafone, set up the first mobile network to compete with Telecom.|$|E

25|$|In February 1990, Governor Hernández Colón – {{serving his}} {{third and final}} term – {{proposed}} {{the sale of the}} PRTC to <b>Bell</b> <b>Atlantic</b> (which merged with GTE in 2000 to create Verizon Communications). Hernández Colón suggested that proceeds from the sale would go toward public education and improved infrastructure. Labor unions in Puerto Rico opposed the sale, however, and on 28 March 3,800 telephone workers went on a one-day strike. On the same day, a march 150,000 Puerto Ricans proceeded to the capitol building in San Juan. This activity – in addition to a law requiring a $3 billion sale price and a ban on firings for 18 months – blocked the proposed sale.|$|E
25|$|Worcester has a municipally owned water supply. Sewage {{disposal}} {{services are}} provided by the Upper Blackstone Water Pollution Abatement District, which services Worcester {{as well as some}} surrounding communities. National Grid USA is the exclusive distributor of electric power to the city, though due to deregulation, customers now have a choice of electric generation companies. Natural gas is distributed by NSTAR Gas; only commercial and industrial customers may choose an alternate natural gas supplier. Verizon, successor to New England Telephone, NYNEX, and <b>Bell</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> is the primary wired telephone service provider for the area. Phone service is also available from various national wireless companies. Cable television is available from Charter Communications, with Broadband Internet access also provided, while a variety of DSL providers and resellers are able to provide broadband Internet over Verizon-owned phone lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{site of the}} Cira Centre sits {{within a}} Keystone Opportunity Improvement Zone (KOZ). A KOZ was {{designed}} to encourage development in poor and blighted areas by exempting the tenants of the building from almost all state and local taxes. In 2002 the Center City office vacancy rate was 12.5 percent and numerous businesses leases were set to expire in 2005 and 2006. Owners of other buildings were critical of having the KOZ for the Cira Centre and the proposed KOZ designation for the Comcast Center, another office high-rise being planned. The landlords were afraid that the tax breaks for the new skyscrapers would attract their existing tenants to the new buildings. On December 24, 2003 Brandywine Realty Trust announced the first tenants to lease room in the Cira Centre. Brandywine Realty Trust signed leases with Dechert LLP, Woodcock Washburn LLP, and Attalus Capital. Dechert LLP and Woodcock Washburn LLP were moving from other city skyscrapers, the <b>Bell</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Tower and One Liberty Place respectively. Attalus Capital was moving its offices from Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Dechert and Woodcock Washburn moving to the Cira Centre fueled the KOZ controversy because Dechert and Woodcock Washburn were wealthy law firms and {{would no longer have}} to pay taxes for numerous years. By 2006, about 60 percent of Cira Centre's tenants came from within Philadelphia.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Kheradpir formed small {{teams that}} were each {{responsible}} for {{coming up with}} and developing new products. Kheradpir implemented a 30-day prototype cycle to rapidly test and modify new technologies in development. His team of approximately 10,000 staff often worked late hours, but positions at Verizon were in high demand, because of the department's rapid pace. According to InfoWorld, he led technology development for strategic initiatives such as FiOS(fiber to the home), process and systems transformation, and many new customer-facing products." [...] In 2003 his team created iobi, which manages address books, caller ID and other features across devices over the internet. The Verizon One, a combination phone, router, modem and smart portable device, was developed from his department the following year. His division also reengineered many of Verizon's core network systems, including call center, website, automated customer service systems, and integrated formerly separate systems from predecessor companies GTE, <b>Bell</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and NYNEX.|$|E

Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), at 555, but the court did find that Rule 8 requires the non-moving party to show plausible factual allegations, accepted as true, to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Id. at 570. A claim has facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. Id. at 556. In so doing, the Court confirmed that the standard set forth in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41 (1957) (the Supreme Court case that had defined the Rule 8 pleading standard prior to <b>Bell</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Corp. v. Twombly), should not be followed in any context.

[...] Souter {{goes on to say that}} the main fallacy in the majority’s position is because they are looking at Iqbal's allegations in isolation and not as a unit. Furthermore, Iqbal is alleging not only that Ashcroft and Mueller allowed the discrimination policy, but that they created it.|$|E
