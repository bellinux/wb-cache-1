5|$|Pryce made a poor {{start to}} the Grand Prix in his DN8 {{and by the end}} of the first lap was in last place. Pryce started to climb <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> field during the next couple of laps, {{overtaking}} Brett Lunger and team mate Renzo Zorzi on lap two, and Alex Ribeiro and Boy Hayje the following lap. By lap 18 Pryce had moved from 22nd to 13th place.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} tombs {{were located}} in cliffs {{at the top of}} scree slopes, under storm-fed waterfalls (KV34 and KV43). As these locations were filled, burials descended to the valley floor, gradually moving <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> slopes as the valley bottom filled with debris. This explains the location of the tombs KV62 and KV63 buried in the valley floor.|$|E
5|$|After {{the train}} departs from the station, it {{immediately}} begins {{to climb the}} vertical (90 degree) lift hill. Upon reaching {{the top of the}} lift, the train turns 45 degrees backwards putting the train and its riders in an upside down position. Then, as the train exits the lift, it goes through a heartline roll before going down the only drop in the layout of the roller coaster. The train speeds through the station going <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> lift. Once it loses momentum the train then returns down passing through the station again. It then proceeds <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> drop and partially into the heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to the ground. After passing the station for the third time, the train is stopped {{near the top of the}} lift hill. It is then lowered back down to the station where the next riders board the train. The XT 150 has the option of sending riders around a second cycle at the operator's discretion. When the train stops on the lift hill at the end of the ride, instead of lowering slowly back to the station, the chain will raise the car up and send it through the ride again.|$|E
5|$|At {{the back}} of the race, Bourdais began a slow climb <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> field. The Toro Rosso driver passed Sutil (who later spun out and retired with a gearbox problem), Nakajima and Coulthard, to sit in 15th by lap30. Rosberg fought Glock for 12th, until he passed the Toyota at the turn14 hairpin on lap12. Rosberg's pit stop relegated him to 18th, {{dropping}} six places. Kubica pitted late, on lap25, dropping from third to ninth, one position outside of the points.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, as the circumstantial coincidences build up, Knight becomes {{convinced}} that Gorman's story is true. The lack of tangible evidence, he claims, {{is due to}} a government cover-up and deliberate misdirection of the police investigation. To <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> claims of a masonic conspiracy, he notes supposed similarities between the Jack the Ripper killings and alleged masonic ritual murders, and accuses Sir Charles Warren, Commissioner of Police, of destroying evidence to protect his freemason cronies. Knight points out that Stowell, who was apparently the first person to suggest Albert Victor's and Gull's involvement in the murders, was a freemason.|$|E
5|$|In previews, {{publications}} such as IGN and GameSpot {{noted that}} the graphics had been improved, {{and that there were}} many new characters and locations. The new minigames were previewed, and IGN pointed out that they offered enough complexity to <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> simple gameplay. In an interview with GameSpot, Ted Price stated that the emphasis for the title was on the new critters, but that Spyro would not be left behind in the story. Year of the Dragon also implemented crack protection, in addition to the copy protection previous games had contained. This helped prevent hackers from cracking the game until two months after release.|$|E
5|$|Peggy tries {{in vain to}} {{extinguish}} the flames, but is forced out by her friends and family. Stacey, unaware of the events, heads upstairs to Lily and becomes trapped. She uses the crowbar to smash a boarded-up window and hands Lily over to Ryan, who has climbed a ladder. Peggy realises Phil is still inside {{and returns to the}} building with Billy. They find him trapped beneath a wooden beam, and are able to drag him out to safety. Ryan goes <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ladder and carries an unconscious Stacey out. Stacey regains consciousness and sees that Lily is safe, and tells Ryan that Lily is his daughter. Peggy stares at the pub as it is completely destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The Maya at Chaktumal fed false {{information}} to the Spanish, and Montejo {{was unable to find}} d'Avila and link up with him. D'Avila returned overland to Xelha, and transferred the fledgling Spanish colony to nearby Xamanha, modern Playa del Carmen, which Montejo considered to be a better port. After waiting for d'Avila without result, Montejo sailed south as far as the Ulúa River in Honduras before turning around and heading <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> coast to finally meet up with his lieutenant at Xamanha. Late in 1528, Montejo left d'Avila to oversee Xamanha and sailed north to loop around the Yucatán Peninsula and head for the Spanish colony of New Spain in central Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The website of the UK {{law firm}} , which was {{associated}} with an anti-piracy client, was affected by the cyber-attack. In retaliation for the initial attacks being called only a minor nuisance, Anonymous launched more attacks, bringing the site down yet again. After coming <b>back</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> front page accidentally revealed a backup file of the entire website, which contained over 300 megabytes of private company emails, which were leaked to several torrents and across several sites on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|When the rarefication wave {{reaches the}} other (open) {{end of the}} tube, air rushes in to fill the slight vacuum. A {{little more than a}} 'neutral' amount of air enters the tube and causes a {{compression}} wave to travel <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> tube (image 4). Once the compression wave reaches the mouthpiece end of the 'tube', it is reflected again back down the pipe. However at this time, either because the compression wave 'bumped' the reed or because of the natural vibration cycle of the reed, the gap opens and another 'puff' of air is sent down the pipe.|$|E

5|$|A {{little after}} two {{o'clock in the}} afternoon, Victorio and his Apaches slowly {{approached}} the springs. Victorio somehow sensed danger and halted his men. With the hostile Apaches in their sights appearing ready to bolt, the soldiers did not wait and opened fire on their own initiative; Victorio's men scattered and withdrew out of carbine range. Victorio's people needed water and believing that {{there were only a few}} soldiers present, regrouped and attacked immediately. As the battle progressed, Victorio sent his warriors to flank the soldiers. Carpenter charged forward with Companies B and H and a few massed volleys from their carbines sent the hostiles scattering <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> canyon. Stunned by the presence of such a strong force but in desperate need of water, Victorio repeatedly charged the cavalrymen in attempts to reach the spring. Grierson's cavalry defenders, now bolstered by Carpenter's two companies, stood firm. The last such attempt to break the soldiers was conducted near nightfall and when it failed, Victorio and his followers withdrew into the westward into the mountains. Carpenter with his two companies remounted in pursuit until darkness halted the effort.|$|E
5|$|After {{one season}} in the Third Division South and {{eighteen}} in total, Edmund Goodman stepped down as manager and returned to administrative duties, and a succession of managers attempted to plot Palace's climb <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> table. However, Palace's stay in the division was to {{last as long as}} the Third Division South itself. With only the champions gaining promotion, it was a difficult division to be promoted from, although Palace came close on more than one occasion. In the fourteen Division Three South seasons pre-Second World War, Palace finished in the top seven ten times, and never lower than fourteenth. Palace finished runners-up no less than three times, and when the 1939–40 season ended, Palace were sitting fourth. Unfortunately the season was only four matches old, cancelled with the onset of the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the 27th Brigade {{held their}} {{positions}} into the afternoon before the Australians were finally withdrawn to {{positions in the}} rear of the brigade, with both sides having suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese then turned their attention to the Canadians on Hill 677, but during a fierce night battle they were unable to dislodge them. The fighting helped blunt the Chinese offensive and the actions of the Australians and Canadians at Kapyong were important in assisting to prevent a breakthrough on the United Nations Command central front, and ultimately the capture of Seoul. The two battalions bore the brunt of the assault and stopped an entire Chinese division during the hard fought defensive battle. The next day the Chinese withdrew <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> valley, in order to regroup. Today, the battle is regarded as one of the most famous actions fought by the Australian and Canadian armies in Korea.|$|E

5|$|Despite their injuries, the SEALs made a {{defensive}} retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts questions to Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the team's position to the Taliban. Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge to flee from the Taliban fighters. Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is {{shot in the}} shoulder; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall forward off the cliff. A dying Dietz remains {{at the top of}} the cliff and is killed by the Taliban insurgents. Murphy decides to try climbing <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> cliff to get a phone signal in order to call in support forces via satellite phone. Axelson and Luttrell shoot at the Taliban fighters to provide Murphy with cover. When he finally reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert the SEAL base of his team's location and request emergency assistance right before he is shot dead by Taliban fighters.|$|E
5|$|His lawyer, Dr Alfred Seidl, felt Hess {{was too old}} {{and frail}} to have managed to kill himself. Wolf Rüdiger Hess {{repeatedly}} claimed {{that his father had}} been murdered by the British Secret Intelligence Service to prevent him from revealing information about British misconduct during the war. Abdallah Melaouhi, who served as Hess's medical orderly from 1982 to 1987, was dismissed from his position at his local district parliament's Immigration and Integration Advisory Council after he wrote a self-published book on a similar theme. According to an investigation by the British government in 1989, the available evidence did not <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> claim that Hess was murdered, and Solicitor General Sir Nicholas Lyell saw no grounds for further investigation. Moreover, the autopsy results support the conclusion that Hess had killed himself. A report released in 2012 again raised the question of whether Hess was murdered. Historian Peter Padfield claims the suicide note found on the body appears to have been written when Hess was hospitalised in 1969.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{traveled}} {{thousands of}} miles across central North America {{in an attempt to}} map and explore the Louisiana Territory of the United States and the Oregon Country, which were then occupied mainly by Native Americans and settlers from Great Britain. As the expedition traveled down and <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Columbia River, it missed the mouth of the Willamette, one of the Columbia's largest tributaries. It was only after receiving directions from natives along the Sandy River that the explorers learned about their oversight. William Clark returned down the Columbia and entered the Willamette River in April 1806. The United States Exploring Expedition passed through the Willamette Valley in 1841 while traveling along the Siskiyou Trail. The expedition members noted extensive salmon fishing by natives at Willamette Falls, much like that at Celilo Falls on the Columbia River.|$|E
