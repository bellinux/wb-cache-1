40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the results of two hypervelocity impact failure risk assessments for critical <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> exposed aboard the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS- 1) to an increased orbital debris environment at its 824 km, 98. 8 deg inclination orbit. The first “generic” approach predicted the number of wires broken by orbital debris ejecta emerging from normal impact with multi-layer insulation (MLI) covering 36, 18, and 6 strand <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> at a 5 cm standoff using the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) code. This approach also included a mathematical approach for computing the probability that redundant wires were severed within the bundle. Based in part on the high computed risk of a critical <b>wire</b> <b>bundle</b> failure from the generic approach, an enhanced orbital debris protection design was examined, consisting of betacloth-reinforced MLI suspended at a 5 cm standoff over a seven layer betacloth and Kevlar blanket, draped over the exposed <b>wire</b> <b>bundles.</b> A second SPH-based risk assessment was conducted that also included the beneficial effects from the high (75 degree) obliquity of orbital debris impact owing to the flight orientation of the exposed wiring and shadowing by other spacecraft components. These factors resulted in a considerably reduced likelihood of critical <b>wire</b> <b>bundle</b> failure compared to the original baseline design with normal impacts and no shadowing...|$|R

40|$|Determining current {{carrying}} capacity (ampacity) of <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> in aerospace vehicles is critical not only to safety but also to efficient design. Published standards provide guidance on determining <b>wire</b> <b>bundle</b> ampacity but offer little flexibility for configurations where <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> of mixed gauges and currents are employed with varying external insulation jacket surface properties. Thermal modeling has been employed {{in an attempt to}} develop techniques to assist in ampacity determination for these complex configurations. Previous developments allowed analysis of <b>wire</b> <b>bundle</b> configurations but was constrained to configurations comprised of less than 50 elements. Additionally, for vacuum analyses, configurations with very low emittance external jackets suffered from numerical instability in the solution. A new thermal modeler is presented allowing for larger configurations and is not constrained for low bundle infrared emissivity calculations. Formulation of key internal radiation and interface conductance parameters is discussed including the effects of temperature and air pressure on wire to wire thermal conductance. Test cases comparing model-predicted ampacity and that calculated from standards documents are presented...|$|R

40|$|Design of wiring for {{aerospace}} vehicles {{relies on}} {{an understanding of}} "ampacity" which refers to the current carrying capacity of wires, either, individually or in <b>wire</b> <b>bundles.</b> Designers rely on standards to derate allowable current flow to prevent exceedance of wire temperature limits due to resistive heat dissipation within the <b>wires</b> or <b>wire</b> <b>bundles.</b> These standards often add considerable margin and are based on empirical data. Commercial providers are taking an aggressive approach to wire sizing which challenges the conventional wisdom of the established standards. Thermal modelling of <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> may offer significant mass reduction in a system if the technique can be generalized to produce reliable temperature predictions for arbitrary bundle configurations. Thermal analysis {{has been applied to}} the problem of <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> wherein any or all of the <b>wires</b> within the <b>bundle</b> may carry current. <b>Wire</b> <b>bundles</b> present analytical challenges because the heat transfer path from conductors internal to the bundle is tortuous, relying on internal radiation and thermal interface conductance to move the heat from within the bundle to the external jacket where it can be carried away by convective and radiative heat transfer. The problem is further complicated by the dependence of wire electrical resistivity on temperature. Reduced heat transfer out of the bundle leads to higher conductor temperatures and, hence, increased resistive heat dissipation. Development of a generalized <b>wire</b> <b>bundle</b> thermal model is presented and compared with test data. The steady state heat balance for a single wire is derived and extended to the bundle configuration. The generalized model includes the effects of temperature varying resistance, internal radiation and thermal interface conductance, external radiation and temperature varying convective relief from the free surface. The sensitivity of the response to uncertainties in key model parameters is explored using Monte Carlo analysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — To achieve small {{delay and}} low {{crosstalk}} for multiple signal nets with capacitive and inductive coupling, we propose {{in this paper}} a novel interconnect structure, staggered twisted-bundle wires where groups of twisted wires are staggered. This new structure {{is different from the}} previously proposed twisted <b>bundle</b> <b>wires</b> with one group of twisted wires and another group of normal wires. Using accurate circuit models and efficient algorithms to find the worst case noise and delay for comprehensive combinations of signal patterns and a range of arrival times, we assume signal and shielding ratio over 1 : 1 for area reduction and compare the aforementioned two structures to coplanar shielding for signal nets. The staggered twisted-bundle has the smallest worst case delay, up to 20 % and 5 % smaller than the coplanar shielding and twisted bundle, respectively. The staggered twisted bundle also has the smallest worst case noise, up to 6 % and 12 % less than coplanar shielding and twisted bundle. Furthermore, the staggered twisted bundle has the smallest delay/noise variation between signal nets. We conclude that without increasing routing area, the staggered twisted bundle is better than the twisted bundle and coplanar shielding in terms of performance and noise. I...|$|R
