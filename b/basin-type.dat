A cubic hole in moist ground is created of about 30 cm (12 inches) on each side. Into the centre of this hole, a collection container is placed. Then a sheet of plastic film is stretched over the hole. Stills made from water bottles or plastic bags.|$|E
5000|$|The engine uses fan-cooling and a Walbro 24 {{diaphragm}} or Dell'Orto 17.5 <b>basin-type</b> carburetor. Designed {{for light}} weight as the overall consideration, the engine weighs 10 kg, plus the exhaust system weight of 2.6 kg. With the Walbro carburetor the Top 80 produces [...] at 9500 rpm. Power is {{delivered to the}} two-bladed wooden propeller though a reverse-turning gear box to reduce output net torque felt by the pilot during acceleration and deceleration. The oil filled gearbox can be fitted with 22/70 gears giving a reduction ratio of 3:182, 21/71 gears giving 3.381, 20/72 gears giving 3.60, 19/73 gears giving 3.842 or 18/74 gears with a ratio of 4.111. The engine also fits a centrifugal clutch that allows idling without turning the propeller, a useful feature in its main application on a paramotor, where it improves ground safety.|$|E
30|$|Internal and {{external}} reflectors {{can be added}} to increase the solar radiation on the still, which will eventually increase the distillate productivity. According to the theoretical analysis done by Tanaka and Nakatake (2006), it is evident that distillate output can be increased up to 48 % when internal {{and external}} reflectors are added. Hiroshi Tanaka had also done an experimental analysis of a <b>basin-type</b> still with internal and external reflectors in winter at Japan, which showed the similar outcome (Tanaka 2009). He also had done a theoretical analysis of <b>basin-type</b> solar still with flat plate external bottom reflector where an increase of 25 – 65 % of distillate production was expected (Tanaka 2011). According to these analyses, the proposed still should have both external suspended reflectors and internal reflectors in the basin liner.|$|E
30|$|Water {{surface area}} is an {{important}} parameter of still productivity. By using wick material, we can increase the exposed surface area of water. Minasian and Al-Karaghouli (1995) combined both wick-type and <b>basin-type</b> still to improve performance of the still. They found that overall efficiency has been increased 85 % more than <b>basin-type</b> still and 43 % more than wick-type still. Hansen et al. (2015) have done the performance analysis on inclined solar still with different new wick materials and wire meshes. They compared the performances of different wick materials like wood pulp, paperwick, wickingwater coral fleece fabric and polystyrene sponge. They achieved maximum distillate of 4.28 l/day using water coral fleece with weir mesh-stepped absorber plate. Murugavel and Srithar (2011) used different wick materials like black cotton cloth, jute cloth, sponge sheet, coir mate, etc. and found light black cotton cloth as the most efficient one. Therefore, light black cotton cloth {{can be used as}} wick material for the proposed still.|$|E

A concluding correlation has been developed for single-basin double-slope solar still with literature data and correlation developed from the present investigation. A power regression in the form y = C(d) n [...] was chosen so that no output is found at zero depth, where the productivity is in liters per square meter per day and the brine depth is in centimeters.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{develops}} a multiple-effect diffusion solar still (MEDS) with a bended-plate design in multiple-effect diffusion unit (MDU) {{to solve the}} peel-off problem of wick material. The MDU is coupled with a vacuum-tube solar collector to produce a high temperature gradient for high productivity. A heat pipe is used to transfer the solar heat to the MDU. A prototype MEDS- 1 L was built and tested outdoors. Four performance indexes are proposed for the performance evaluation of MEDS, including daily pure water {{production per unit area}} of glass cover, solar absorber, and evaporating surface (Mcov, Msol, Mevp, respectively), and solar distillation efficiency Rcov. The outdoor test results of MEDS- 1 L show that the solar collector supply temperature Th reaches 100 °C at solar radiation 800 Wm- 2. The highest Mcov is 23. 9 kgm- 2 d- 1 which is about 29 % higher than the <b>basin-type</b> MEDS [11]. The highest value is 25. 9 kgm- 2 d- 1 for Msol and 2. 79 kgm- 2 d- 1 for Mevp. The measured Rcov is 1. 5 - 2. 44, higher than the <b>basin-type</b> MEDS (1. 45 - 1. 88). The Mcov, Msol, Mevp and Rcov of MEDS- 1 L are all higher than the theoretical calculation of a MEDS with a flat-plate solar collector coupled with a heat pipe (MEDS-FHP) [17]. © 2014 Elsevier B.

The concluding correlation developed has been compared with the concluding correlation developed by Khalifa and Hamood [27]. Also, a correlation has been developed for single-slope single-basin solar still separately from the data available in the literature. It has been found that for single-slope single-basin solar still alone, it has the regression coefficient of 0.829 which is higher than the correlation developed by Khalifa and Hamood [27] including both single- and double-slope <b>basin-type</b> solar stills.|$|E
30|$|There {{are several}} types of solar {{distillation}} stills that have been devised for converting available brackish or waste water into potable water. The horizontal <b>basin-type</b> still is one of these. And because of its low productivity, it is not commonly used. On the other hand, tilted solar stills heat up more rapidly, operate at higher mean temperatures, have lower thermal capacity, and produce somewhat more potable water. There are also other types of solar stills that have been evolved, such as multistage flash distillation stills and solar concentrator stills.

The sediment at Site 808 is highly affected by excess fluid pressures throughout the sediment column. Excess fluid pressure is severe below the major fault boundary, the decollement.

40|$|Deep basin {{hydrocarbon}} accumulations {{have been}} widely recognised in North America and include the giant fields of Elmworth and Hoadley in the Western Canadian Basin. Deep basin accumulations are unconventional, being located downdip of water–saturated rocks, with no obvious impermeable barrier separating them. Gas accumulations in the Nappamerri Trough, Cooper Basin, exhibit several characteristics consistent with North American deep basin accumulations. Log evaluation suggests thick gas columns and tests have recovered only gas and no water. The resistivity of the entire rock section exceeds 20 Ωm over large intervals, and, as in known deep basin accumulations, the entire rock section may contain gas. Gas in the Nappamerri Trough is located within overpressured compartments which witness the hydraulic isolation necessary for gas saturation outside conventional closure. Furthermore, the Nappamerri Trough, like known deep basin accumulations, has extensive, coal–rich source rocks capable of generating enormous hydrocarbon volumes. The above evidence for a deep <b>basin–type</b> gas accumulation in the Nappamerri Trough is necessarily circumstantial, {{and the existence of}} a dee gas accumulation can only be proven unequivocally by drilling wells outside conventional closure. Exploration for deep <b>basin–type</b> accumulations should focus on depositional–structural–diagenetic sweet spots (DSDS), irrespective of conventional closure. This is of particular significance for a potential Nappamerri Trough deep basin accumulation because depositional models suggest that the best net/gross may be in structural lows, inherited from syndepositional lows, that host stacked channel sands within channel belt systems. Limiting exploration to conventionally–trapped gas may preclude intersection with such sweet spots. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|In Ghana, the granitoids {{rocks are}} in two {{different}} groups, thus the basin type granitoid and the belt type granitoids. These granitoids have been studied petrographycally mineralogically and geochemically, especially the belt-type granitoids {{since it is the}} major host of gold occurrences in Ghana, however there are little studies on the petrogenesis and emplacement conditions of this important rock. In this paper we present the lacking knowledge on the emplacement conditions (temperature, pressure and the oxygen fugacity) of the <b>basin-type</b> granitoids in the winneba area of Ghana. The calc-alkaline <b>basin-type</b> granitoids in the Winneba area is composed of quartz+ plagioclase +potash feldspar+ alkali feldspar+ Biotite+ Hornblende +amphibole+ titanite. The plagioclase composition ranges from Ab 58 An 1. 7 Or 0. 45 to Ab 98 An 41 Or 41 and mainly in the field of albite and oligoclase. The amphiboles however have a compositional range of Mg/(Mg +Fe) ranging from 0. 52 to 0. 62 and a Si content of 7. 1 to 7. 4 atom per formula unit (afu). Their end-member compositions in the classification diagram are controlled by Magnesio-Hornblend, tschermakitic-Hornblend, and tschemakite substitution types. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analyses of coexisting hornblende and plagioclase (hornblende-plagioclase thermometry), Al content in hornblende (aluminum-in-hornblende barometry) and the assemblage titanite-magnetite-quartz were used to constrain the P, T and fO 2 during the crystallization of the parent magmas. The estimated temperature indicated an average temperature of crystallization of 677 ºC reflecting late crystallization from highly oxidized magma (log fO 2 - 20 bars).

The algorithm was applied to a solar still tested at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow (55 520 N, 4 150 W). Under the prevailing meteorological conditions, it was found that previous models overestimated the computed solar load on the saline water surface.

The rocks contained plagioclase, Kfeldspar, amphibole, Biotite and titanite as the main mineral phase. The CIPW normative mineral shows that the rocks are granodiorite, monzogranite, and quartz -monzonite. The geochemical classification of the basintype granitoids based upon the Fe-Number, the modified alkali-lime index and the aluminium saturation index, defined the rocks as ferroan, alkali-calcic to calc-alkali and peraluminous respectively. The rocks also showed a calc-alkaline affinity. The aluminous character by the molar ratio Al/ (Na+ K+ Ca/ 2) show I-type characteristics of the rocks which is a characteristic of basin type granitoids in Ghana.

Boninitic pillow lavas, ranging from high-Mg compositions to andesites and dacites, have been erupted within large submarine volcanic edifices (calderas and volcanoes) associated with active rifting of both the northern end of the Tofua volcanic arc and in a backarc position relative to the arc volcanoes on the northern Tonga Ridge.

Similar trends have been reported in previous studies and the analysis indicates that the tendency of sea level increase over the SO has become more spatially homogeneous during the last decade, with changes in the increasing rate in 2000 and 2006. The other modes consist of stationary, <b>basin-type</b> modes, and an eastward-propagating wave. The stationary modes are particularly dominant in the Indian and Atlantic Ocean basins, where their spatial structure appears to be shaped by the basin geometry and the bottom topography.

30|$|Further {{attempts}} have been made by researchers to investigate the effect of water depth in double-slope single-basin solar still. A digital simulation method has been done for the productivity of a complicated still by Cooper [16], and the influence of more common variables such as water depth, wind velocity, still insulation, double glass cover, cover slope, and daily variability on the productivity has been investigated. Results of the simulation indicate that water depth and thermal insulation have little effect on the productivity at shallow water depth and that a double glass cover and high cover slopes are not justifiable. Garg and Mann [17] have investigated the effect of climatic, operational, and design parameters for single- and double-slope solar stills under the Indian arid zone regions and to find the effect of all possible variables on the performance of the single-effect solar still. Akash et al. [18] have studied the <b>basin-type</b> solar still under local climatic conditions and concluded that lower water depth and salinity of the brine produced higher distillate yields for the double-slope passive solar still. The effect of wind speed on daily productivity of some active and passive solar stills using computer simulation for different solar still designs has been studied by El-Sebaii [19]. It has been shown that for the active and multi-effective passive stills, daily productivity increases with the increase of wind velocity up to a typical velocity; beyond that, the productivity becomes insignificant for single-effect passive stills. Al-Hinani et al. [20] have studied the effect of climatic, design, and operational parameters such as solar intensity, wind velocity, ambient temperature, glass cover slope angle, feedwater temperature water depth on the basin, and basin material on the distillate output of the <b>basin-type</b> solar still. They found that the 23 ° cover tilt angle, 0.1 -m insulation thickness, and asphalt coating of solar still of the shallow water basin are the optimum parameters for producing higher yields. Al-Hayeka and Badran [21] have found the productivity of freshwater of two different designs of stills, which are asymmetric greenhouse with mirror and symmetric greenhouse solar stills, under the climatic conditions of Jordan. It was inferred that the distilled water output of the asymmetric greenhouse type was 20 % higher than that of the symmetric greenhouse type. Mowla and Karimi [22] have simulated a mathematical model for a solar still; the rate of production of freshwater has been calculated, and experiments have been carried out in Shiraz. It has been found that the experimental and calculated results are in good agreement.

The model was applied to a conventional solar still and an advanced solar still with. separate condenser. The conventional solar still was tested at New Delhi (28 o 35 ¢ N, 77 o 12 ¢ E) in previous work while the advanced distillation system was developed in this investigation and it comprised three basins with saline water.

The <b>basin-type</b> solar stills are the most frequently studied over the years by researchers of solar distillation systems. Their investigations have been directed towards improving the daily distillate output per unit basin area of solar still (Naim and Abd El Kwui 2002; Abu-Hijleh and Rababah 2003; Al-Hayeka and Badran 2004; Badran and Al-Tahaineh 2005; Tiwari and Tiwari 2006; Sahoo et al. 2008; Abdallah et al. 2009). Various techniques to enhance the yield of distilled water from tilted solar stills have been experimented and presented by many researchers, for example, a tilted double-sided solar still (St. Headley 1973), an inverted trickle solar still (Badran et al. 2004), and tilted wick solar still (Tripathi and Tiwari 2004) and (Tanaka and Nakatake 2007).

40|$|Mangrove epifaunal {{communities}} {{have access to}} various carbon and nitrogen sources and we hypothesized {{that the degree of}} material exchange with the aquatic environment might influence the overall use of different substrates by intertidal communities. Therefore, we analyzed C and N stable isotope ratios in primary producers, sediments and 245 samples of epifauna hand-collected from 5 sites in India, Sri Lanka and Kenya (representing estuarine, lagoonal and <b>basin-type</b> mangrove forests). Several patterns emerged from this data set. First, epifaunal communities used a range of available food substrates at all sites studied, including mangrove-derived organic matter, local microphytobenthos and micro-epiflora, as well as imported C and N from the aquatic environment (i. e. phytoplankton- and/or seagrass-derived organic matter). Secondly, our data indicate that at sites with significant inputs of aquatic sources, use of mangrove carbon is rather limited on a community basis, whereas in systems with less material exchange with adjacent waters, the relative importance of mangroves is higher. Thus, despite the unquestionable impact some epifaunal species may have on leaf litter dynamics, the dependency of the invertebrate community as a whole on mangrove litter is not ubiquitously large and varies according to the availability of local versus tidally imported sources. Precise quantification of the relative importance of different substrates with d 13 C and d 15 N is, however, not always straightforward due to the multitude of available sources and the overlap in source stable isotope signatures. Micro-epiflora on mangroves trees were remarkably depleted in 15 N in all systems (d 15 N between - 8. 2 and - 2. 4 ‰) and thus form an example where d 15 N is a useful source indicator, as low d 15 N values of several gastropod species indicated substantial feeding on such epiflor...|$|E
40|$|For many years, {{there has}} been {{speculation}} about "hidden" or "blind" geothermal systems—reservoirs that lack an obvious overlying surface fluid outlet. At present, {{it is simply not}} known whether "hidden" geothermal reservoirs are rare or common. An approach to identifying promising drilling targets using methods that are cheaper than drilling is needed. These methods should be regarded as reconnaissance tools, whose primary purpose is to locate high-probability targets for subsequent deep confirmation drilling. The {{purpose of this study was}} to appraise the feasibility of finding "hidden" geothermal reservoirs in the Basin and Range using electrical survey techniques, and of adequately locating promising targets for deep exploratory drilling based on the survey results. The approach was purely theoretical. A geothermal reservoir simulator was used to carry out a lengthy calculation of the evolution of a synthetic but generic Great <b>Basin-type</b> geothermal reservoir to a quasi-steady "natural state". Postprocessors were used to try to estimate what a suite of geophysical surveys of the prospect would see. Based on these results, the different survey techniques were compared and evaluated in terms of their ability to identify suitable drilling targets. This process was completed for eight different "reservoir models". Of the eight cases considered, four were "hidden" systems, so that the survey techniques could be appraised in terms of their ability to detect and characterize such resources and to distinguish them from more conventionally situated geothermal reservoirs. It is concluded that the best way to find "hidden" basin and range geothermal resources of this general type is to carry out simultaneous SP and low-frequency MT surveys, and then to combine the results of both surveys with other pertinent information using mathematical "inversion" techniques to characterize the subsurface quantitatively. Many such surveys and accompanying analyses can be carried out for the cost of a single unsuccessful deep "discovery well"...|$|E

Solar stills are usually classified into two categories: a single-effect type and a multi-effect type that reuses wasted latent heat from condensation (Fath, 1998; Toyama et al., 1990). The integration between a solar collector and a still is classified into passive and active stills (Tiwari & Noor, 1996; Kumar & Tiwari; 1998). Single-effect passive stills are composed of convectional basin, diffusion, wick and membrane types (Murase et al., 2000; Korngold et al., 1996). The varieties of a still with cover cooling (Abu-Arabi et al., 2002; Abu-Hijleh et al., 1996) and a still with a multi-effect type basin (Tanaka et al., 2000) have been studied. A <b>basin-type</b> solar still is the most common among conventional solar stills (Chaibi, 2000; Nafey et al., 2000; Hongfei et al., 2002; Paul, 2002; Al-Karaghouli & Alnaser, 2004; Tiwari & Tiwari, 2008). A small experimental Tubular Solar Still (TSS) was constructed to determine the factors affecting the nocturnal production of solar stills (Tleimat & Howe, 1966). Furthermore, a detailed analysis of this TSS of any dimensions for predicting its nocturnal productivity was presented (Tiwari & Kumar, 1988). They (Tleimat & Howe, 1966; Tiwari & Kumar, 1988) mainly focused on the theoretical analysis of the nocturnal production of TSS. A simple transient analysis of a tubular multiwick solar still was presented by Kumar and Anand (1992). This TSS (Tleimat & Howe, 1966; Tiwari & Kumar, 1988; Kumar & Anand, 1992) is made of heavy glass and cannot be made easily in remote areas. The cost of glass is quite high as well (Ahsan et al., 2010). When water supply is cut off due to natural disasters (tsunamis, tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes, landslides, etc.) or unexpected accidents, a lightweight compact still, which is made of cheap and locally acquired materials, would be reasonable and practical. The second model of the TSS was, therefore, designed to meet these requirements and to improve some of the limitations of the <b>basin-type</b> still and of the TSS made of glass. Since the cover material (a vinyl chloride sheet) is a little heavy and cannot form into an ideal size easily (Islam, 2006; Fukuhara & Islam, 2006; Islam et al., 2005; Islam et al., 2007 a), a polythene film was adopted as a cheap new material for the cover. Consequently, the cover weight and the cost of the second model were noticeably reduced and the durability was distinctly increased. These improvements also can help to assemble and to maintenance the second model of TSS easily for sustainable use (Ahsan et al., 2010). A complete numerical analysis on TSS has been presented by Ahsan & Fukuhara, 2008; Ahsan, 2009; Ahsan & Fukuhara, 2009; Ahsan & Fukuhara, 2010 a, 2010 b. Many researchers (Chaibi, 2000; Clark, 1990; Cooper, 1969; Dunkle, 1961; Hongfei et al., 2002; Malik et al., 1982; Shawaqfeh & Farid, 1995) have focused their research on conventional basin type stills rather than other types such as tubular still. Most of the heat and mass transfer models of the solar still have been described using temperature and vapor pressure on the water surface and still cover, without noting the presence of intermediate medium, i. e. humid air (Dunkle, 1961; Kumar & Anand, 1992; Tiwari & Kumar, 1988). Nagai et al. (2011) and Islam et al. (2007 b), however, found that the relative humidity of the humid air is definitely not saturated in the daytime. Islam (2006) formulated the evaporation in the TSS based on the humid air temperature and on the relative humidity in addition to the water temperature and obtained an empirical equation of the evaporative mass transfer coefficient. Since the empirical equation does not have a theoretical background, it is still not known whether it can be used, when the trough size (width or length) is changed (Ahsan & Fukuhara, 2008). In this chapter, a comparison of the evaporation and distilled water production between the first model and second one is described. Additionally, this chapter aims to present the theoretical formulation of a model for the evaporation in a TSS by dimensional analysis...|$|E
40|$|Coastal {{mangroves}} lose {{large amounts}} of water through evapotranspiration (ET) that can be equivalent {{to the amount of}} annual rainfall in certain years. Satellite remote sensing can {{play a crucial role in}} identifying regional ET trends and surface energy changes after disturbances in isolated and inaccessible areas of coastal mangrove wetlands, like those found in Everglades National Park in southern Florida. Using a combination of long-term datasets acquired from the NASA Landsat 5 TM satellite database and the Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research project, the present study investigates how ET as well as radiation and other energy balance parameters in the Everglades mangrove ecotone have responded to multiple hurricane events and restoration projects over the past two decades. An energy balance model using satellite data was used to estimate latent heat (λE) in tall and scrub mangrove environments. An eddy-covariance tower and weather tower supplied long-term data of multiple environmental and meteorological parameters that were used in calibrating and testing the modeled results from the Landsat images. Results identified significant differences in λE and soil heat flux measurements between the tall and scrub, and fringe and basin mangrove environments. The scrub mangrove site had the lowest λE rates, highest soil heat flux and lowest biophysical index (i. e., Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) values. Mangrove damage and mortality associated with two strong hurricanes decreased FVC, NDVI, and SAVI, and increased soil heat flux at the tall mangrove site located in a <b>basin-type</b> environment. Recovery of the spectral characteristics, energy balance parameters and λE following hurricane disturbance was quicker in fringe mangroves than in basin mangroves. Latent heat fluxes (λE) were also relatively high after each storm and may have increased as a result of increasing vapor pressure deficits. Remote sensing of the surface energy balance and λE of mangrove forests can help our understanding of how these environments respond to disturbances to the landscape and the effect that these changes can have on the energy and water budget. Moreover, relationships between energy and water balance components developed for the coastal mangroves of southern Florida could be extrapolated to other mangrove systems in the Caribbean to measure changes caused by natural events and human modifications...|$|E
30|$|A single-effect {{conventional}} {{solar still}} is an air tight basin that contains saline water (i.e., feed water). It is enclosed by a transparent top cover, usually of glass which allows {{incident solar radiation}} to pass through. The inner surface of the basin is usually blackened {{to increase the efficiency}} of the system by absorbing more of the incident solar radiation (Tiwari et al. 2003). A multiple wick bed-type solar still with condenser arrangement gives higher output than simple traditional solar still (Reddy et al. 1983). The multi-wick solar still is most economical and efficient one. From the investigation, it showed that the conventional solar still made of concrete with black fiber reinforced coating from inside is suitable for a large scale system with capacity more than 1000  l/day. Whereas the small scale system with capacity less than 1000  l/day, the fiber reinforced plastic multi-wick solar still is appropriate (Tiwari and Garg 1985). A potable-type solar still was designed with basin area of 0.54  m 2. The daily output of fresh water was found 1.7  l/day in the month of July. The maximum output of fresh water is 0.339  l/h at 13 : 00  hours. The feed surface water 330  ppm (TDS), conductivity 1.291  mS/cm, and pH 6.72 were measured before distillation. The distilled water was found TDS of 30  ppm, conductivity 41  mS/cm, and pH of 6.5 after distillation (Samee et al. 2007). Sodha et al. (1981) have developed new concept on multi-wick solar still to increase the productivity of still. They used a black jute cloth pieces uneven length placed one upon another and separate by polyethylene film. The entire wick remains wet due to capillary action. The width of each jute cloth is 86  cm and length of wick is 100  cm. The glass thickness is 3.0  mm. Output distilled was 2.5  l/m 2 day. Mahdi et al. (2011) designed and experiment a wick-type solar still. They used charcoal as an absorber for their analysis and increase efficiency of 53  % on clear day of summer. Naim and ElKawi (2002) investigated on <b>basin-type</b> solar still in which charcoal is used as an absorber medium. A similar inclined wick-type solar still was tested by SMA Maustafa et al. (1979) in which a 2.5 -cm-thick black synthetic wettable mat of area 0.182  m 2 was placed over a plastic sheet. The flow of water in the wick was controlled using a flow regulator and shut-off valve operated with a photocell. Another novel idea in a wick-type solar still was given by Frick and Summerfeld (1973), who suggested the use of jute cloth along the width of the still, dipped in saline water trays. The jute cloth remains wet due to capillary action and therefore avoiding the use of water distribution system. They are also reported the efficiencies achieved 40 – 50  % with this type of still. Kabeel (2009) investigated on a concave-type wick for absorption and pyramid shaped still were normally used for condensation. The average production of still was 4.1  l/m 2 day. Sakthivel et al. (2010) used jute cloth on middle vertical position of the basin and another jute cloth is on the surface wall of the still. A series of experimental and theoretical studies on inclined wick-type solar stills are conducted by Mimaki et al. (1981) and Tanaka et al. (1981) in Japan. They used a black cotton towel as wick with an effective area of 1.79  m 2 and glass thickness of 5  mm. The still output recorded was 5.0  l/m 2 day at the solar global radiation of 6.67  kWh/m 2.|$|E
40|$|In this study, a new Tubular Solar Still (TSS) made of cheap, {{lightweight}} and locally 	acquisitioned materials was successfully designed for practical use, {{particularly in the}} 	remote or coastal areas of underdeveloped and developing countries to produce distilled 	water from saline water using solar energy. The new TSS consists of a trough, a frame 	and a tubular cover. Since the cover material of our old TSS, a vinyl chloride sheet, was 	a little heavy and cannot form into a desirable size easily, a polythene film was 	alternated as a new material for {{the cover of the}} new TSS. Consequently, the weight and 	cost of the new TSS were reduced by about 61 % and 92 % of the old one, respectively. 	The fabrication cost of a new TSS was only about 250 yen. These improvements also 	can help to assemble and repair of the new TSS easily and enables much more realistic 	use of the new TSS. 	The present study is concerned with the design of the new TSS as well as 	development of the theoretical models for evaporation from the water surface and for 	condensation on the inner surface of the tubular cover inside the TSS. As a result, two 	unique and independent theoretical models were developed and formulized. One is 	based on evaporation theory using the evaporative mass transfer coefficient, h_, and 	another is based on condensation theory using the condensative mass transfer coefficient, 	hcdha. The theoretical derivations of h_ and h_ are significant to enhance the 	applicability of the design of TSS, because these two coefficients were obtained 	empirically (do not have theoretical backgrounds) in our previous study. The 	evaporation model due to natural convection was formulized by a dimensional analysis 	taking account of the properties of the humid air inside the TSS. The condensation 	model was based on a film-wise condensation theory that takes into account of the 	thermal resistance of the humid air as an unsaturated vapor-gas mixture. 	Finally, a transient model to calculate the diurnal variation of the production rate was 	proposed using mass and energy balance equations incorporating the mass transfer 	coefficients (h_ and h_) and the heat transfer coefficients (h_, h_, h_, h_, h_, h_ 	and h_). The mass balance equations of the water in a trough and the water vapor in the 	humid air, and the energy balance equations of the water in the trough, trough, humid 	air and tubular cover were formulized, respectively. An explicit finite difference scheme 	was developed to predict the time variations of the water temperature, T_w, humid air 	temperature, T_, and tubular cover temperature, T_c, vapor density of the humid air, 	evaporation and condensation fluxes under arbitrary weather conditions. 	A few sets of laboratory experiments were carried out at the University of Fukui, 	Japan to evaluate the production performance, the evaporation and condensation 	coefficients, the trough heat transfer coefficients and to find out the effect of water 	depths, h_w, on the production performance of the TSS. It was revealed that the hourly 	evaporation, M_, was linearly proportional to the trough width, B, and the value of 	exponent m was 1 in M_ =ηB^m, regardless of the trough length, L, for 0. 49 ≤L≤ 1. 5 m. The 	evaporation coefficient was proportional to the temperature difference between the 	water in the trough and the tubular cover. The condensation coefficient due to the 	thermal resistance between the humid air and the condensate liquid film was inversely 	proportional to the dry air pressure fraction. 	To support the validity of the present transient model, field experiments were carried 	out in Fukui, Japan and in Muscat, Oman from June to July, 2008 in addition to the 	laboratory experiments. Two typical one-day data of July 5, 2008 (in Fukui, Japan) and 	July 13, 2008 (in Muscat, Oman) are presented. It was observed that the relative 	humidity of the humid air, RH_, was remarkably below 100 %, i. e. definitely not 	saturated in the daytime but was almost 100 % during the nights over the field 	experiments. The solar radiation is the most influential parameter on the productivity of 	TSS. It was established from both laboratory and field experimental results that h_w is 	also one of the influential parameters which affect the productivity. 	The output of the present transient model was compared with the field experimental 	data and proved that the model could precisely predict the diurnal profiles of T_w, T_, T_c 	and RH_. Consequently, the present evaporation and condensation models were quite 	satisfactory to the calculation accuracy of the hourly production flux. Our previous 	evaporation and condensation models (using empirical h_ and h_, respectively) 	slightly overestimated and underestimated the observed production flux, respectively. 	The conventional approach (Dunkle’s and Ueda’s models) developed for a <b>basin-type</b> 	solar still was not useful to predict the hourly production flux of a TSS. 	Finally, it is concluded that the present evaporation and condensation models are the 	most reliable tool for predicting the daily production of a TSS...|$|E
40|$|Rocks of the Kemp and MacRobertson Land coastline, east Antarctica, expose a {{semi-continuous}} profile {{through the}} middle- to lower-crustal sections of a Neoproterozoic convergent orogen called the Rayner Complex. Kemp Land exposures {{are dominated by}} Archaean felsic orthogneiss interpreted to represent the tectonically reworked margin of a continental fragment called the Napier Complex, whereas MacRobertson Land exposures are dominated by supracrustal successions of probable Proterozoic age and voluminous felsic plutonic rocks. All of these rocks were deformed and metamorphosed at granulite facies conditions during the ca. 1000 – 900 Ma Rayner Structural Episode, which was {{a consequence of the}} convergence of crustal blocks that now constitute extensive parts of eastern India and east Antarctica, and formed part of the supercontinent called Rodinia. This thesis examines the geochronological, metamorphic and structural evolution of the Kemp and MacRobertson Land rocks and focuses on two main themes: (1) the Archaean and early Proterozoic history of continental crust before the Rayner Structural Episode as preserved in Kemp Land exposures; and (2) syn-orogenic processes related to the Rayner Structural Episode which affected all rocks along the coast, and implications for the tectonic evolution of the Rayner Complex. Exposures in Kemp Land, which includes parts of both the Napier (Rippon Point) and Rayner (Oygarden Group, Broka and Havstein Islands, Stillwell Hills) Complexes, are dominated by layered Archaean orthogneiss. On the basis of in situ zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic analysis, precursors to this orthogneiss were emplaced before ca. 3650 – 3500 Ma and involved signifi cant melting of ca. 3900 – 3700 Ma crustal material with input from primary ca. 3600 Ma mantle melts. Plausible protoliths include ca. 3800 Ma orthogneiss exposed in the Tula Mountains in the Napier Complex. Evidence for a pervasive ca. 2470 Ma tectonothermal event is preserved in rocks from most of western Kemp Land and the western Napier Complex. These isotopic data suggest Kemp Land was part of the eastern Napier Complex after ca. 3500 Ma, and part of the greater Napier Craton at, or before, ca. 2470 Ma. Charnockite was emplaced in the Stillwell Hills region prior to ca. 1620 Ma and represents post-Archaean crustal addition to Kemp Land. Source magmas are likely to have involved some juvenile material and the reworking of a ca. 2600 Ma lower crust. The ca. 980 Ma Mawson Charnockite exposed in MacRobertson Land was sourced from ca. 2100 Ma lower crustal protoliths, without significant addition of juvenile magmas. The zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic data distinguish at least two terranes: a crustal block dominated by Archaean rock in Kemp Land, and a crustal block dominated by comparatively juvenile Proterozoic rock in MacRobertson Land. Much of the Kemp Land terrane represents a part of the Napier Complex that was tectonically reworked during the Neoproterozoic. Rocks to the east of the Stillwell Hills form the MacRobertson Land terrane and represent Proterozoic crust accreted to a complexly deformed Kemp-Napier Archaean craton after ca. 1600 Ma. Any incorporation of juvenile material during orogenesis was minor, indicating that this part of the Rayner Complex consists mainly of ensialic crust. The effects of plate convergence related to the Rayner Structural Episode were first recorded by juvenile metasediments in MacRobertson Land. A shallowly-dipping high-grade gneissosity developed at ca. 995 – 970 Ma, contemporary with peak metamorphic conditions. Well-developed mineral microstructures in metapelitic gneiss from Cape Bruce and the Forbes Glacier along the Mawson Coast record heating to T ≈ 850 – 920 °C at P ≈ 5. 4 – 6. 2 kbar. Syn-orogenic felsic granitoids, including voluminous charnockitic magma, were emplaced during continued deformation. This magma flux is interpreted to have maintained elevated temperatures at a regional scale; advection was accompanied by crustal thickening to maximum pressures of P ≈ 6. 0 – 6. 8 kbar. Mineral reaction textures in metasedimentary gneiss, formed during this ‘anticlockwise’ P-T-t path, record near-isobaric cooling and protracted metamorphism over ca. 80 Myrs. Diverse metapelitic assemblages from the Stillwell Hills, Broka and Havstein Islands and the Oygarden Group in Kemp Land record ca. 940 – 930 Ma peak metamorphic conditions that involved T ≈ 870 – 990 °C at P ≈ 7. 4 – 10 kbar, with pressure conditions increasing westward towards the Napier Complex. A penetrative sub-horizontal gneissosity formed in these high-P, high-T rocks some 30 – 60 Myrs after equivalent features formed in lower-P rocks in MacRobertson Land. Mineral reaction textures in Kemp Land rocks define a decompressive-cooling trajectory (dP/dT ≈ 17 bar/°C), which is part of a ‘clockwise’ P-T-t path that documents uplift and cooling of the Napier cratonic margin over ca. 25 Myrs. The contrast in the P-T-t paths recorded by the adjacent terranes, coupled with the spatial variation in the style and intensity of deformation, is likely to reflect the effects of intense strain partitioning and spatially focussed magmatism across the collisional margin. Initial penetrative deformation is inferred to have been accompanied by syn-orogenic magmatic doming in the internal portions of the orogen (MacRobertson Land), while the tectonic reworking of older, anhydrous parts of the crust closer to the orogenic front (Kemp Land) occurred during the waning stages of orogenesis. This later phase of convergence associated with the involvement of the Kemp Land terrane may have made a dynamic contribution to the prevailing tectonic framework, indicated by a change in the style of deformation that occurred across several locations in MacRobertson Land at ca. 940 – 900 Ma. Geological relationships in the Stillwell Hills region, which lies at the eastern margin of tectonically reworked Archaean crust, reflect both the pre- and syn-orogenic evolution of the Rayner Complex. Layered orthogneiss preserves evidence for two high-grade fabrics which developed during at least two deformational events (D 1 and D 2) prior to ca. 1620 Ma. Correlation with high-grade fabrics in rocks further west suggest that the alignment of early leucocratic segregations (S 1) may have occurred at ca. 3490 – 3400 Ma. The correlation of mafic layers within the layered Archaean orthogneiss with ca. 2400 – 2350 Ma mafic dykes in the Napier Complex suggests that the development of the dominant form surface (S 2) occurred during the Palaeoproterozoic. D 1 and D 2 suggest that significant dehydration of the Kemp Land terrane occurred prior to the Rayner Structural Episode. Penetrative deformation at mid- to lower-crustal levels at ca. 945 Ma involved the development of a pervasive sub-horizontal S 3 gneissosity and inclined to recumbent F 3 folds. North-trending F 3 fold axes rotate towards the east in areas of high strain, consistent with strain having accumulated from progressive simple shear. D 3 structures are invariably overprinted by D 4 and D 5 dome and <b>basin-type</b> folding. North to northeast-trending upright to inclined F 4 folds are sub-parallel to F 3 folds; both fold generations are inferred to have developed during west-directed ductile thrusting of the Napier cratonic margin. D 3 and D 4 structures were reorientated about east to southeast-trending F 5 folds during the waning stages of orogenesis. Late Neoproterozoic to early Palaeoproterozoic D 6 mylonitic shear zones cross-cut all ductile structures and reflect north-directed intraplate deformation. Charnockitic magmatism at ca. 1620 Ma in the Stillwell Hills reflects a significant tectonothermal event during the late Palaeoproterozoic in this region of east Antarctica. The correlation of the Kemp and MacRobertson Land rocks with equivalent late Palaeoproterozoic granulite facies rocks in the southern Eastern Ghats Belt (India) suggests that the Kemp-Napier Craton may have collided with the eastern Dharwar Craton at this time. An amalgamated Kemp-Napier-eastern India crustal block presents a plausible continental shield for the accretion of crustal fragments now comprising the Rayner Complex in MacRobertson Land and the central and northern Eastern Ghats Belt during the Meso-Neoproterozoic. This scenario is consistent with an active continental margin setting at ca. 1600 Ma, which may have evolved to continent-continent collision by ca. 1000 Ma. The involvement of the southern and/or eastern (present coordinates) continental block(s) during Neoproterozoic orogenesis remains enigmatic...|$|E
