500|$|Writing for Online Onslaught, Adam Gutschmidt {{felt that}} the event had some humorous moments but did not offer a solid card of wrestling. He enjoyed the match between The Hart Foundation and Demolition, but he rated the Bad News Brown vs. Jake Roberts and Orient Express vs. Jim Duggan and Nikolai Volkoff matches as duds. He gave the Randy Savage vs. Dusty Rhodes match {{negative}} one star. Julian Radbourne of Bleacher Report enjoyed the event, particularly the tag team title match. He {{felt that the}} Ultimate Warrior vs. Rick Rude match was {{not as good as}} their previous encounter, but he stated that the event was [...] "well worth viewing". The columnists reviewed the event for 411mania. Stuart Carapola felt that the match for the WWF Tag Team Championship was the highlight; he enjoyed the show at the time but saw nothing particularly special looking back at the event. Arnold Furious felt that the storyline for the tag team title match was too complicated and that the main event match was [...] "really poor". He thought that the show had too many matches, some of which served little purpose, and that the show is not worth recommending. Sydney <b>Brown</b> <b>felt</b> that the match for the Intercontinental Championship was [...] "nothing" [...] but that the tag team title match was good; <b>Brown</b> <b>felt</b> that both main events were the best of any SummerSlam to that point and gave the event a B-minus.|$|E

According to the description on the site, it was [...] "an all-cloth doll with <b>brown</b> <b>felt</b> hair and blue eyes. He is 20 inches standing. He wears a blue shirt and black pants". The doll's face also included Todd's scar. Even though several {{years had passed since}} the gang rape and Todd had [...] "since settled down", and had become a more sympathetic character, rape victim advocate groups thought that selling the doll glorified sexual assault; so ABC removed the doll from its online store.

Steelers retained possession at their 21-yard line. A few plays later, the Steelers were forced into a fourth down situation just over mid-field with 1 yard to go. Coach Noll chose {{to go for the}} conversion, which was gained by a short Franco Harris run.

500|$|By 1967, KFC {{had become}} the sixth largest {{restaurant}} chain in the US by sales volume, and 30 percent of sales were take-out. <b>Brown</b> <b>felt</b> {{that the company had}} to expand quickly, or else emerging rivals such as Church's Chicken would steal the company's lead; 863 outlets were opened in 1968. The company's growth pushed its stock value to [...] "stratospheric" [...] levels, according to Reuters, and in 1969 it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, KFC entered into ventures with other companies. Brown believed that the Colonel Sanders brand could be used to market anything, and launched the [...] "Kentucky Roast Beef" [...] restaurant chain, and [...] "Colonel Sanders Inns" [...] motels. The two ventures quickly failed, although the roast beef chain had 100 outlets by 1970. That same year, KFC entered a joint venture with the California-based fish and chips chain H. Salt Esquire, which proved more successful, but was sold off in 1980.|$|E
500|$|Scholars have {{observed}} that Justice Kennedy's majority opinion [...] "embraced Bustamonte's premise that when police request consent to search, the request itself carries the implication that an alternative of refusal exists". Other scholars, such as Ric Simmons, have noted that Drayton reflects [...] "the Court at the midpoint of this evolution, moving from a subjective binary test that focuses {{on whether or not}} the subject acted voluntarily, to a more nuanced objective test that focuses on the amount of compulsion used by the law enforcement officer". Additionally, Matthew Phillips wrote that Drayton [...] "illustrates the metamorphosis of the totality-of-the-circumstances test into a purely objective test" [...] because Justice Kennedy's opinion [...] "did not explicitly consider any subjective factors" [...] with respect to whether Drayton and <b>Brown</b> <b>felt</b> they could deny consent when questioned by the police. Phillips suggested that the decision to abandon subjective factors could lead to [...] "bizarre results" [...] in cases, like this, where [...] "circumstances of the search indicate at least some level of coercion".|$|E
500|$|When {{finishing}} The Playboy, <b>Brown</b> <b>felt</b> {{guilt over}} {{still looking at}} Playmates and credits having come out in print with helping him overcome his shame. [...] While many have interpreted the book as a condemnation of pornography, to Brown {{it is about the}} guilt he was made to feel for using the media. [...] Some interpretations, such as those of Sullivan and Darrel Epp, see The Playboy demonstrating how the idealized images in pornography distort societal norms and expectations of beauty; one example cited is a scene in which Brown says he could only maintain an erection with one girlfriend if he fantasized about his favourite Playmates. [...] Brown has objected to this interpretation—rather, he sees it as a flaw in the work, in that it does not provide enough context for what he intended to communicate: that he had gotten into a relationship with a woman whom he did not find sexually attractive, and that if Playboy did not exist he would have fantasized about other images of women.|$|E

500|$|The {{results of}} British {{airborne}} operations in North Africa were mixed, {{and the subject}} of a detailed report by Browning. The airborne troops had operated under several handicaps, including shortages of photographs and maps. All the troop carrier aircrew were American, who lacked familiarity with airborne operations and in dealing with British troops and equipment. <b>Browning</b> <b>felt</b> that the inexperience with handling airborne operations extended to Eisenhower's Allied Forces Headquarters (AFHQ) and that of the British First Army, resulting in the paratroops being misused. He felt that had they been employed more aggressively and in greater strength they might have shortened the Tunisian Campaign by some months. The 1st Parachute Brigade had been called the [...] "Rote Teufel" [...] or [...] "Red Devils" [...] by the German troops they had fought. Browning pointed out to the brigade that this was an honour, as [...] "distinctions given by the enemy are seldom won in battle except by the finest fighting troops." [...] The title was officially confirmed by General Sir Harold Alexander, commander of the Allied 18th Army Group, and henceforth it applied to all British airborne troops.|$|R
500|$|Bardon has {{revealed}} that both he and Brown were sceptical about their characters marrying.

As it happened, we've had some nice things to do. And we are married, and it's worked out all right." [...] Brown has reiterated that she feared Dot would become boring if she married Jim, but that producers persuaded her that the marriage might be a good thing. On-screen, Dot had suffered the death of her grandson Ashley, and <b>Brown</b> <b>felt</b> that a traumatic event like that would have changed her character. In her opinion, the only way Dot would have got over Ashley's death [...] "would be to have someone else to care for and when it happened there was nobody [...] with marrying Jim she gets a family– that's what persuaded me. That house will become a house again– it will have a central point, {{they will be able to}} use the house as a central point, as Dot will be there." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{is not of}} much {{interest}} now to discuss the ethics or the metaphysics of the 'rapping spirits;' but the subject deserves {{more than a passing}} mention in the life of Mrs. Browning, because it has been said, and apparently with authority, that 'the only serious difference which ever arose between Mr. Browning and his wife referred to the subject of spiritualism.'[15] It is quite certain that Mr. Browning did not share his wife's belief in spiritualism; a reference to 'Sludge the Medium' is sufficient to establish his position in the matter. But it is easy to make too much of the supposed 'difference.' Certainly it has left no trace in Mrs. Browning's letters which are now extant. There is no sign in them that the divergence of opinion produced the slightest discord in the harmony of their life. No doubt Mr. <b>Browning</b> <b>felt</b> strongly as to the character of some of the persons, whether mediums or their devotees, with whom his wife was brought into contact, and he may have relieved his feelings by strong expressions of his opinion concerning them; but {{there is no reason to}} lay stress on this as indicating any serious difference between himself and his wife.|$|R

IGN's Stapleton favoured the PlayStation 4 version's graphics over the Xbox One, but thought both consoles rendered the game well and maintained mostly consistent frame rates. He praised the increased frame rate and graphics options offered in the PC version. VideoGamer.com called the console version's frame rate so consistent it was [...] "scarcely believable", although GameSpot's Walton cited occasional frame rate dips.

VideoGamer.com praised the Rockstar Editor's accessibility on PC but criticised some of its limitations, such as camera angle restrictions.

6000|$|After resting {{a week in}} Paris Mr. and Mrs. Browning went on to Pisa, {{where they}} {{remained}} nearly seven months. The [...] "miracle" [...] of the Pisa life was Mrs. Browning's gain in health. [...] "You are not improved, you are transformed," [...] was Mrs. Jameson's exclamation. It was at Pisa that Mr. Browning came to know of the sonnets his wife had written during the progress of their courtship and engagement. In Critical Kit-Kats (1896) Mr. Gosse tells the story as Mr. Browning gave it to him: [...] "One day, early in 1847, their breakfast being over, Mrs. Browning went upstairs, while her husband stood at the window watching the street till the table could be cleared. He was presently aware of someone behind him, although the servant had gone. It was Mrs. Browning who held him by the shoulder to prevent his turning to look at her, {{and at the same}} time pushed a packet of papers into the pocket of his coat. She told him to read that and to tear it up if he did not like it; and then she fled again to her room." [...] Mr. <b>Browning</b> <b>felt</b> at once that he had no right to keep such poetry as a private possession. [...] "I dared not," [...] he said, [...] "reserve to myself the finest sonnets written in any language since Shakespeare's." [...] They were accordingly published in 1850, under the intentionally mystifying title, Sonnets from the Portuguese.|$|R

However, even those critics who disliked the staging choices praised the verse-speaking for its clarity and freshness.

60|$|Yes, Ernest: the contemplative life, {{the life}} that has for its aim not DOING but BEING, and not BEING merely, but BECOMING--that is what the {{critical}} spirit can give us. The gods live thus: either brooding over their own perfection, as Aristotle tells us, or, as Epicurus fancied, watching with the calm eyes of the spectator the tragicomedy {{of the world that}} they have made. We, too, might live like them, and set ourselves to witness with appropriate emotions the varied scenes that man and nature afford. We might make ourselves spiritual by detaching ourselves from action, and become perfect by the rejection of energy. It has often seemed to me that <b>Browning</b> <b>felt</b> something of this. Shakespeare hurls Hamlet into active life, and makes him realise his mission by effort. Browning might have given us a Hamlet who would have realised his mission by thought. Incident and event were to him unreal or unmeaning. He made the soul the protagonist of life's tragedy, and looked on action as the one undramatic element of a play. To us, at any rate, the [Greek text which cannot be reproduced] is the true ideal. From the high tower of Thought we can look out at the world. Calm, and self-centred, and complete, the aesthetic critic contemplates life, and no arrow drawn at a venture can pierce between the joints of his harness. He at least is safe.
