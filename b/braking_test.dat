50|$|A <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> is a {{term used}} in motorsport.

40|$|At present time, the <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> bench conducts the <b>braking</b> and {{suspension}} <b>tests</b> of {{front or}} rear axles {{and the test}} results are evaluated through one axle. The purpose of the <b>brake</b> <b>testing</b> system is to determine braking force and damping coefficient dissymmetry of one axle. Thus, this test system evaluates the performance of service brake, hand brake and suspension systems by considering separately front and rear axle dissymmetry. For this reason, the effects of different braking and damping forces applied by right and left wheels of both axles on braking performance of all vehicle are not determined due to available algorithm of the test bench. Also, the other brake failures are not occurred due to the algorithm of <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> system. In this study, the interface has been developed to determine the other effects of dissymmetry and the other brake failures by using the one axle results of <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> bench. The interface has algorithm computing the parameters according to the interaction between front and rear axles by only using measured test results. Also, it gives the warnings by comparing changes in the parameters with braking performance rules. <b>Braking</b> and suspension <b>tests</b> of three different vehicles have been conducted by using <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> bench to determine {{the performance of the}} algorithm. Parameters based on the axle interaction have been calculated by transferring <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> results to the interface and the test results have been evaluated.

40|$|Objective: This article aims at {{identifying}} {{the most significant}} measures in 2 perception-response (PR) tests performed at a driving simulator: a <b>braking</b> <b>test</b> and a lateral skid test, which were developed in this work. Methods: Forty-eight subjects (26 females and 22 males) {{with a mean age}} of 24. 9 ± 3. 0 years were enrolled for this study. They were asked to perform a drive on the driving simulator at the University of Pisa (Italy) following a specific test protocol, including 8 - 10 braking tests and 8 - 10 lateral skid tests. Driver input signals and vehicle model signals were recorded during the drives and analyzed to extract measures such as the reaction time, first response time, etc. Following a statistical procedure (based on analysis of variance [ANOVA] and post hoc tests), all test measures (3 for the <b>braking</b> <b>test</b> and 8 for the lateral skid test) were analyzed in terms of statistically significant differences among different drivers. The presented procedure allows e valuation of the capability of a given test to distinguish among different drivers. Results: In the <b>braking</b> <b>test,</b> the reaction time showed a high dispersion among single drivers, leading to just 4. 8 percent of statistically significant driver pairs (using the Games-Howell post hoc test), whereas the pedal transition time scored 31. 9 percent. In the lateral skid test, 28. 5 percent of the 2 × 2 comparisons showed significantly different reaction times, 19. 5 percent had different response times, 35. 2 percent had a different second peak of the steering wheel signal, and 33 percent showed different values of the integral of the steering wheel signal. Conclusions: For the <b>braking</b> <b>test,</b> which has been widely employed in similar forms in the literature, it was shown how the reaction time, with respect to the pedal transition time, can have a higher dispersion due to the influence of external factors. For the lateral skid test, the following measures were identified as the most significant for application studies: the reaction time for the reaction phase, the second peak of the steering wheel angle for the first instinctive response, and the integral of the steering wheel angle for the complete response. The methodology used to analyze the test measures was founded on statistically based and objective evaluation criteria and could be applied to other tests. Even if obtained with a fixed-base simulator, the obtained results represent useful information for applications of the presented PR tests in experimental campaigns with driving simulators...|$|E

40|$|Mineral oil {{and other}} {{lubricants}} are commonly {{applied to the}} gauge corner of high rails to avoid wheel/rail interface wear on railways. Although not directly applied {{to the top of}} the rail, these lubricants sometimes end up on this surface, and the relatively low coefficient of friction they produce can cause slipping or sliding at the wheel/rail interface during vehicle acceleration or braking. It has been reported in the literature that the application of traction fluid (a modern technique involving the use of a synthetic lubricant) produced a higher coefficient of friction than that of a conventional wheel/rail interface lubricant. In this study, tests were performed using traction fluid to evaluate its influence on a vehicle’s braking distance and other important performance elements from a practical point of view. The results of the braking perform-ance evaluation carried out on a <b>braking</b> <b>test</b> stand showed that the braking distance increase with synthetic traction fluids was roughly one-half of that observed with conventional wheel/rail lubrication oil. This suggests the potential of using traction fluid as a wheel/rail lubricant...|$|E

The 14 degrees of freedom (14 -DOF) vehicle model is integrated with an analytical tyre dynamics using Calspan tyre model.

Several transient handling tests were performed, namely sudden acceleration and sudden <b>braking</b> <b>test.</b> Comparisons of the experimental result and model response with sudden braking and throttling imposed motion are made. The results of model validation show that the trends between simulation results and experimental data are almost similar with acceptable error.

40|$|In the past, <b>brake</b> <b>testing</b> of rubber-tyred {{vehicles}} {{operating in}} quarries, opencast coal sites, mines and similar environments, comprised ‘simple’ stopping distance tests, typically {{carried out at}} daily or weekly intervals. More recently, many operators of such plant have progressed to using a <b>brake</b> <b>testing</b> method that employs electronic instrumentation, {{as a means of}} determining the ‘brake ratio’ of a vehicle. This is because instrumented testing gives more accurate results. Accordingly, the time between performing these instrumented tests has increased to monthly, or even 3 -monthly, intervals. For both simple and instrumented test methods, international standard ISO 3450 is often (wrongly) used as the guide to acceptable <b>brake</b> performance <b>testing</b> regimes. The ISO standard contains formulae that enable either a stopping distance or a brake ratio to be calculated (depending on which test method is used). However, these calculated values are minimum levels of braking ability necessary for a vehicle to be placed on the market. That is, the ISO standard is a minimum standard for manufacture, not a maintenance standard. To put this into context, it is likely that any ‘modern’ vehicle will have levels of braking performance approaching twice these minimum ISO values. In using these ISO values as routine test pass or fail criteria, organisations may be indirectly accepting that brakes on modern vehicles can deteriorate by up to 50 per cent before their operators become concerned with braking ability. In addition, test conditions on site (particularly speed and gradient) may be much less onerous than those used in ISO 3450, which produces low test results. The overall outcome of this may be a ‘poor’ <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> result, but one that exceeds a low level pass criterion and is not, therefore, seen as a test failure. Another common problem with some <b>brake</b> <b>testing</b> regimes is that they do not readily correlate to site operating conditions; in particular to gradients, but also to vehicle speed and load. The law requires organisations to ‘ensure’ that work equipment is suitable (safe) for the conditions of use it will encounter. This means being able to demonstrate that vehicle braking capabilities are adequate for actual site operating gradients, speeds and loads. Naturally therefore, any testing regime should accurately take account of the site conditions which the vehicle will be exposed to. In order to address these shortcomings regarding <b>brake</b> <b>testing</b> of rubber-tyred vehicles, this guide explains the brake ratio method of <b>brake</b> <b>testing.</b> A step-by-step guide on how to correlate braking performance with actual site conditions and how to design and put in place a suitable <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> regime is preceded by several discussion chapters.
