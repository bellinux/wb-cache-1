5|$|Malvern {{water has}} been <b>bottled</b> and {{distributed}} in the UK and abroad from {{as early as the}} reign of James I, with water bottling at the Holy Well being recorded in 1622. Various local grocers have <b>bottled</b> and distributed Malvern water during the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it was first <b>bottled</b> on a large commercial scale by Schweppes, who opened a bottling plant at Holywell in Malvern Wells in 1850. As official caterers to the Great Exhibition of 1851, Schweppes introduced the water as Malvern Soda, later renaming it Malvern Seltzer Water in 1856. In 1890 Schweppes moved away from Holywell, entered into a contract with a Colwall family, and built a bottling plant in the village in 1892. The Holywell was subsequently leased to John and Henry Cuff, who <b>bottled</b> there until the 1960s. The Holywell became derelict until 2009 when {{with the aid of a}} Lottery Heritage grant, production of 1200 bottles per day of Holywell Spring Water was recommenced by an independent family-owned company. The well is believed to be the oldest bottling plant in the world.|$|E

5|$|Draught beer's {{environmental}} impact can be 68% lower than <b>bottled</b> beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer {{is estimated to be}} 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a <b>bottled</b> micro-brew beer's CO2 emissions. Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the {{environmental impact}} of beer consumption.|$|E

5|$|In October 2011, Heineken {{sold the}} McEwan's beer brands to Wells & Young's for around £20 million, and {{production}} of McEwan's Best Scotch and canned and <b>bottled</b> brands moved to Bedford. The new owners vowed to reintroduce McEwan's as a cask ale brand and launch an expanded premium <b>bottled</b> range. Together with the Younger's brands McEwan's generates £80 million of sales annually in the UK, and McEwan's is now the largest Wells & Young's brand. It is the highest-selling ale brand in Scotland where it has a 20 per cent market share. Like most largely pasteurised ale brands in the UK {{it has been in}} a state of managed decline. The beers are sold predominantly in Scotland and the north of England; a small amount is exported to Italy. 2012 saw the launch of McEwan's Export in bottles, and a new seasonal cask-conditioned golden ale called McEwan's Gold. In 2013, export sales to Canada were resumed, having been discontinued under Heineken. In April 2013 McEwan's Red was launched, aimed at younger drinkers and with the intention of expanding the brand into England. McEwan's beers began to be sold in France in April 2013.

40|$|Issue: A {{successful}} {{program for}} re-washing recycled glass containers {{for use in}} applications such as wine <b>bottling</b> depends on overcoming a number of challenges, including developing collection infrastructure, sorting diverse <b>bottle</b> streams, achieving efficient washing, and market penetration. <b>Bottle</b> washing programs may focus {{on a variety of}} <b>bottle</b> types, including beer <b>bottles,</b> wine <b>bottles,</b> or juice <b>bottles.</b> This Best Practice focuses on the key elements of a wine bottle-washing program, although many of the concepts are applicable to other containers. A successful bottle-washing program requires the integration of collection and supply infrastructure, sorting protocols, and equipment selection. Best Practice: Historically, <b>bottles</b> were manufactured to heavy specifications as returnables. Today, most glass containers are manufactured as one-way containers, not intended to withstand the rigors of multiple re-washings. Wine <b>bottles</b> remain an exception. Wine <b>bottles</b> manufactured in the United States generally have the same weight as those manufactured in Europe, where washing wine <b>bottles</b> is a common procedure. Because it contains a non-pressurized liquid, a wine <b>bottle</b> does not have the same potential to break from pressure, as does a defective container of beer or soda. However, the development of coated glass <b>bottles</b> may lead to lighter weight wine <b>bottles</b> as well. In addition, only regions with an adequate wine production industry are potential locations for wine <b>bottle</b> washing facilities. Finally, wine <b>bottles</b> wholesale for 35 ¢- 40 ¢each, while beer <b>bottles</b> cost only about 10 ¢, so washing may be more economically feasible for wine <b>bottles.</b> The collection of <b>bottles</b> must be structured to maximize the recovery of usable containers.

5|$|When William Worthington died in 1800, his brewery {{was one of}} {{the largest}} outside London. From 1866 a Worthington chemist, Horace Tabberer Brown, pioneered brewing science in the {{separation}} and cultivation of pure yeast strains, and from 1872 the company was the first in the world to systematically use a laboratory in the brewing process. The company merged with its major Burton rival Bass in 1927. Throughout the 1920s until the 1960s the brand, in <b>bottled</b> form, ranked alongside Bass and Guinness as one of only three beers with nationwide distribution. However, <b>bottled</b> beer sales declined as keg beer grew in popularity throughout the 1960s, and the Worthington brewery was closed in 1965. The beers continued to be brewed elsewhere, and Bass used the Worthington brand for its principal keg bitter offerings from the 1960s onward, first as Worthington E, then as Worthington Best Bitter from the 1980s, and Worthington Creamflow from the 1990s to the present.|$|E

5|$|Along with Riesling, Sauvignon blanc {{was one of}} {{the first}} fine wines to be <b>bottled</b> with a screwcap in {{commercial}} quantities, especially by New Zealand producers.

Dry and sweet white Bordeaux, including oak-aged examples from Pessac-Léognan and Graves, as well as some Loire wines from Pouilly-Fumé and Sancerre are some of the few examples of Sauvignon blancs with aging potential.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of these experiments {{was to provide}} benchmark data to validate calculational codes used in critically safety assessments of plant configurations. Arrays containing up {{to as many as}} sixteen three-liter <b>bottles</b> filled with plutonium nitrate were used in the experiments. A split-table device was used in the final assembly of the arrays. Ths planar arrays were reflected with close fitting plexiglas on each side and on the bottom but not the top surface. The experiments addressed a number of factors effecting criticality: the critical air gap between <b>bottles</b> in an array of fixed number of <b>bottles,</b> the number of <b>bottles</b> required for criticality if the <b>bottles</b> were touching, and the effect on critical array spacing and critical <b>bottle</b> number due to the insertion of an hydrogeneous substance into the air gap between <b>bottles.</b> Each <b>bottle</b> contained about 2. 4 l of Pu(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 4 } solution at a Pu concentration of 105 g Pu/l, with the {sup 240 }Pu content being 2. 9 wt% at a free acid molarity H{sup +} of 5. 1. After the initial series of experiments were performed with <b>bottles</b> separated by air gaps, plexiglas shells of varying thicknesses were placed around each <b>bottle</b> to investigate how moderation between <b>bottles</b> affects both the number of <b>bottles</b> required for criticality and the critical spacing between each <b>bottle.</b> The minimum of <b>bottles</b> required for criticality was found to be 10. 9 <b>bottles,</b> occurring for a square array with <b>bottles</b> in contact. As the <b>bottles</b> were spaced apart, the critical number increased. For sixteen <b>bottles</b> in a square array, the critical separation between surfaces in both x and y direction was 0. 96 cm.
