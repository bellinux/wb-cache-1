The sows were divided into three groups according to <b>backfat</b> thickness before farrowing, i. e., 15. 0 to 20. 0 mm (n = 21), 20. 5 to 25. 0 mm (n = 35), > 25. 0 mm (n = 14) and were categorized into two groups according to the postpartum supportive treatment, i. e., control (n = 31) and treatment (n = 39). After farrowing, the sows in treatment group received the same medications as in control sows. Furthermore an intravenous supportive treatment with amino acids and vitamins was administered in treatment groups. Rectal temperature and clinical signs of the sows including vaginal discharge, udder problems and appetite were determined at d 0, 1, 2 and 3 of parturition. It was found that, on average, the <b>backfat</b> thickness was 22. 4 ± 3. 9 mm at farrowing and 19. 9 ± 2. 9 mm at weaning. The <b>backfat</b> loss and the relative <b>backfat</b> loss during the lactation period were 2. 6 mm and 10. 6 %, respectively.

40|$|Background: Meat quality {{involves}} many traits, such as marbling, tenderness, juiciness, and <b>backfat</b> thickness, all {{of which}} require attention from livestock producers. <b>Backfat</b> thickness improvement by means of traditional selection techniques in Canchim beef cattle has been challenging due to its low heritability, and it is measured late in an animal?s life. Therefore, the implementation of new methodologies for identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to <b>backfat</b> thickness are an important strategy for genetic improvement of carcass and meat quality. Results: The set of SNPs identified by the random forest approach explained as much as 50 % of the deregressed estimated breeding value (dEBV) variance associated with <b>backfat</b> thickness, and a small set of 5 SNPs were able to explain 34 % of the dEBV for <b>backfat</b> thickness. Several quantitative trait loci (QTL) for fat-related traits {{were found in the}} surrounding areas of the SNPs, as well as many genes with roles in lipid metabolism. Conclusions: These results provided {{a better understanding of the}} <b>backfat</b> deposition and regulation pathways, and can be considered a starting point for future implementation of a genomic selection program for <b>backfat</b> thickness in Canchim beef cattle. 201...|$|E

In experiment I, Landrace gilts were fed ad libitum, from 10 weeks of age to puberty, diets containing either 2800 (LE), 3400 (ME) and 3900 (HE) Kcal DE/kg. Age at puberty was delayed in gilts fed LE and ME. <b>Backfat</b> thickness was significantly reduced in LE and ME groups. Puberty onset was more determined by age and <b>backfat</b> thickness than by weight. In experiment II, all gilts that had shown normal heat within 240 days of age, were inseminated on the second estrus and given the same diet as received during their growing period. Feed was restricted to 2. 0 kg per day during gestation and was provided ad libitum in lactation. Gilts in LE and ME gained less weight and <b>backfat</b> during gestation than gilts in HE group. Gilts gaining more weight and <b>backfat</b> during gestation, with a resulting higher body weight and <b>backfat</b> thickness at parturition, lost more in lactation.

40|$|The {{variation}} in <b>backfat</b> of commodity pork {{has declined to}} the point some major packers are no longer measuring <b>backfat</b> depth. From our previous research with Berkshire pigs, {{a large amount of}} {{variation in}} <b>backfat</b> and loin eye area (LEA) still existed, especially between barrows and gilts. In our previous research, barrows average one inch <b>backfat</b> depth around 210 pounds whereas gilts did not achieve one inch until 260 pounds. This potentially may be a meat quality issue for gilts marketed less than 260 pounds. The objective of these trials was to replicate our previous study and to determine whether these differences persisted within a different set of Berkshire pigs under the same nutritional regimen. Understanding how feed programs and growth rates affect lean and fat deposition rates is a critical aspect to these niche programs in order to maintain consistency and quality of the Berkshire pork products marketed. Overall, barrows averaged an inch of <b>backfat</b> between 230 and 250 lb body weight whereas gilts average <b>backfat</b> was. 90 inches at 269 pounds market weight. Only a 30 % of the gilts within these two groups were over one inch <b>backfat</b> at market.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the effect of pork carcass <b>backfat</b> thickness on the dissection efficiency of four primal cuts (ham, loin, shoulder, belly), including correlation coefficients. The research material consisted of 80 pork carcasses. <b>Backfat</b> thickness (mm) was measured on cold half-carcasses using a vernier caliper at 6 points: at the first cervical vertebra (atlas), over shoulder at the thickest point, on the back, at the beginning, center, end of the gluteus medius muscle (CI, CII, CIII). On the basis of the average <b>backfat</b> thickness, measurements from 6 points were separated into two experimental groups: I (< 25 mm); II (≥ 25 mm). Detailed dissection of the elements was performed to define mass (g) : total, intermuscular fat, bones and lean meat. The significant effect of fat thickness on intermuscular fat content regardless of the cut was noted. Correlations between the average <b>backfat</b> thickness of 6 points and the total weight of the four main elements were calculated. In addition, the correlation coefficients were compared between the dissection elements and the average <b>backfat</b> thickness of 6 and 5 points. Higher <b>backfat</b> thickness determined the increase in the total mass of loin, shoulder and belly. A statistically proven correlation was shown between the average <b>backfat</b> thickness and the total mass of the analysed elements (r= 0. 293). When comparing the correlation coefficients of a different number of measurements a specific tendency was observed. Positive correlation coefficients were slightly higher for an average of 5 points of <b>backfat</b> thickness and negative correlation coefficients were slightly higher for an average of 6 points. Statistical differences between groups were recorded at the same level for the same parameters (P≤ 0. 001 and 0. 01 <P≤ 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract Background Peroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}} delta {{belongs to}} the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. It is a key regulator of lipid metabolism. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta gene (PPARD) has been assigned to a region on porcine chromosome 7, which harbours a quantitative trait locus for <b>backfat.</b> Thus, PPARD is considered a functional and positional candidate gene for <b>backfat</b> thickness. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test this candidate gene hypothesis in a cross of breeds that were highly divergent in lipid deposition characteristics. Results Screening for genetic variation in porcine PPARD revealed only silent mutations. Nevertheless, significant associations between PPARD haplotypes and <b>backfat</b> thickness were observed in the F 2 generation of the Mangalitsa × Piétrain cross as well as a commercial German Landrace population. Haplotype 5 is associated with increased <b>backfat</b> in F 2 Mangalitsa × Piétrain pigs, whereas haplotype 4 is associated with lower <b>backfat</b> thickness in the German Landrace population. Haplotype 4 and 5 carry the same alleles at all but one SNP. Interestingly, the opposite effects of PPARD haplotypes 4 and 5 on <b>backfat</b> thickness are reflected by opposite effects of these two haplotypes on PPAR-δ mRNA levels. Haplotype 4 significantly increases PPAR-δ mRNA levels, whereas haplotype 5 decreases mRNA levels of PPAR-δ. Conclusion This study provides evidence for an association between PPARD and <b>backfat</b> thickness. The association is substantiated by mRNA quantification. Further studies are required to clarify, whether the observed associations are caused by PPARD or are the result of linkage disequilibrium with a causal variant in a neighbouring gene. </p...|$|E

Experiment 1 evaluated feeding duration of choice white grease (CWG) and soybean oil. Increasing feeding duration of pigs fed CWG or soybean oil increased (quadratic, P < 0. 01) iodine value (IV) in jowl fat and <b>backfat.</b> Pigs fed soybean oil had increased (P < 0. 01) IV in jowl and <b>backfat</b> compared with pigs fed CWG. In Exp. 2 dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS), extruded expelled soybean meal (EESM), and CWG were used to evaluate diets with common iodine value product (IVP) from ingredients varying in unsaturated fat level and concentration. Pigs fed either diet with DDGS had increased (P = 0. 02) <b>backfat</b> and jowl fat IV, compared with all other treatments. Pigs fed EESM had increased (P = 0. 04) <b>backfat</b> and jowl fat IV compared with the control, low CWG, and high CWG. Pigs fed low CWG and high CWG had increased (P = 0. 04) jowl fat IV compared to the control. Increasing dietary fat increased carcass fat IV, with unsaturated fats from DDGS and EESM having a greater affect than more saturated fats, such as CWG, even when formulated to the same IVP. Experiment 3 evaluated the effects of increasing CWG in corn- and sorghum-based diets on fat quality. There was a grain source X fat level interaction (P = 0. 04) for IV in both <b>backfat</b> and jowl fat. Adding CWG increased IV in <b>backfat</b> and jowl fat for pigs fed corn- and sorghum-based diets; however, the greatest increase was between 0 and 2. 5 % CWG in sorghum-based diets and between 2. 5 and 5 % CWG in corn-based diets.

Altogether 8139 animals of two maternal genotypes were involved: Slovenian Landrace - line 11 (SL 11) and hybrid 12 (Slovenian Large White X Slovenian Landrace - line 11). Statistical model included owner and sow genotype as fixed effects. <b>Backfat</b> thickness and growth rate were included as linear regression. Data was analyzed by GLM procedure in SAS/STAT. Average weight of gilts was 129. 4 +/- 9. 6 kg at 206. 7 +/- 6. 8 days of age, indicating average growth rate of 626 g/day. Gilts had 13. 26 mm of <b>backfat</b> thickness, in range from 5. 5 mm to 31. 5 mm.

40|$|Records {{for flight}} time, {{average daily gain}} and <b>backfat</b> were {{analysed}} from 9, 638 pigs measured between April 2004 and November 2007. Genetic parameters were estimated for the three traits using alternative animal models, fitting combinations of additive genetic, common litter and grower group effects fitted as random terms. Log likelihood ratio tests showed that all three random effects were significant for the three traits analysed. Heritability estimates were 0. 15 ± 0. 02 for flight time, 0. 22 ± 0. 03 for average daily gain and 0. 40 ± 0. 04 for <b>backfat.</b> Estimates for common litter (c 2) and grower group (g 2) effects were small (0. 02 to 0. 05) for flight time and <b>backfat.</b> Conversely, for growth rate estimates of c 2 and g 2 were 0. 08 ± 0. 01 and 0. 17 ± 0. 01, respectively. It is recommended that grower group be recorded for further investigations of social genetic effects. Flight time was genetically correlated with <b>backfat</b> (0. 21 ± 0. 09) but had no significant genetic relationship with growth rate (0. 14 ± 0. 11). Overall, little correlated response is expected in flight time resulting from selection for higher growth and lower <b>backfat...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{trial was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the effect on growth performance of restricted diets using conventional (CONV) or low-CP and low-essential amino acid diets (LP) on pigs of 4 genetic lines (GL) : Anas (A), DanBred (D), Goland (G) and Topigs (T). In two rounds, 184 pigs (gilts and barrows), born in the same week, were raised on a common feeding regime till 80 kg BW. From 80 kg BW, the pigs were housed in 8 pens (10 to 12 pigs/pen) equipped with feeding station recording individual daily feed intake and received CONV or LP diets. During the early (90 to 120 kg BW) and late (120 to 165 kg BW) finishing periods the CONV diets contained 147 and 132 g CP/kg feed and 50 and 41 g lysine/kg CP, respectively, while LP diets contained 112 and 100 g CP/kg feed and 50 and 41 g lysine/kg CP, respectively. Every three weeks pigs were individually weighted and <b>backfat</b> thickness was ultra-soundly measured at P 2 point. Data were subjected to ANOVA and diet was tested on pen within round as line of error. All growth traits were influenced by GL (P< 0. 001) : the D pigs had greatest final BW (172 kg), ADG (0. 700 kg/d), gain:feed ratio (0. 272) and the lowest final <b>backfat</b> depth (15. 9 mm) and <b>backfat</b> gain (+ 7. 5 mm); the A and G pigs exhibited similar final BW (165 kg), average daily gain (ADG, 0. 686 kg/d), gain:feed ratio (0. 266), final <b>backfat</b> depth (18. 6 mm) and <b>backfat</b> depth gain (+ 8. 9 mm); the T pigs had the lowest final BW (159 kg), ADG (0. 637), gain:feed ratio (0. 248) and final <b>backfat</b> depth (16. 2 mm) and <b>backfat</b> depth gain (+ 7. 7 mm). The dietary treatment did not influence final BW and ADG, but LP increased <b>backfat</b> depth gain from + 8. 0 to + 8. 6 mm (P= 0. 013) compared to CONV. The GL × feed interaction was never significant. Differences among GL were more relevant than those due to {{the reduction of the}} dietary CP.

40|$|Real-time {{ultrasound}} data of <b>backfat</b> thickness, longissimus thoracis muscle depth and longissimus thoracis muscle area {{were obtained from}} 210 Piétrain pigs (98 gilts and 112 barrows) using the Pie Medical Scanner 200 equipped with an animal science probe (ASP- 18) and frequency of 3. 5 MHz. They were fed ad libitum and slaughtered at {{an average age of}} 213 days for an average weight of 101 kg. The day before slaughter, four longitudinal and transverse images were taken on the level of the last rib and the tenth rib from each animal. The repeatability of ultrasound last rib <b>backfat</b> (ULRBF) measurements was similar to that of tenth rib <b>backfat</b> (UTRBF) (t = 0. 87). Ultrasound last rib longissimus thoracis muscle depth (ULRMD) and area (ULRMA) measurements were more repeatable than those corresponding to the tenth rib. The best correlation between carcass lean percentage estimated by the Fat Lean Meter (CGM lean) and ultrasound carcass measurements was obtained with <b>backfat</b> thickness (r = - 0. 51). The correlation between CGM lean percentage and ULRMD and between CGM lean percentage and ULRMA were higher than those between CGM lean percentage and UTRMD and between CGM lean percentage and UTRMArespectively. When the CGM lean percentage was predicted from ultrasound <b>backfat</b> thickness, the accuracy of the regression equation was the same regardless of the probing site (last or tenth rib). On the other hand, when longissimus thoracis muscle measurements (depth and area) are included together with <b>backfat</b> thickness in prediction equations, the last rib was more accuracy. Therefore, the last rib site can serve as the probing site for CGM lean percentage prediction...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasound is {{regarded}} as a promising method to determine the intramuscular fat content of pork loin. At intact carcasses, the signal passes the <b>backfat</b> whose ultrasound parameters (sound velocity and attenuation) have not been fully investigated. This study intended to collect a dataset of ultrasound parameters for individual <b>backfat</b> layers and to elucidate relationships with structural and compositional characteristics. In-vitro measurements at 10 MHz were conducted on <b>backfat</b> samples of pork carcasses representative for German populations. The average sound velocity ranged from 1436 ± 9 to 1470 ± 37 ms- 1 for the fat layers, and 1682 ± 23 ms- 1 for skin. Velocity of the compound <b>backfat</b> decreased with overall thickness. Attenuation was not affected by thickness ranging between 1. 6 ± 0. 7 and 2. 7 ± 1. 5 dBMHz- 1 cm- 1 for all layers. Sound velocity was negatively correlated with fat content and dry matter. The obtained results are anticipated to improve signal correction prior to spectral analysis of ultrasound measurements at intact carcasses...|$|E
40|$|Adipose {{tissue is}} not only a storage organ {{involved}} in fuel metabolism, but also an endocrine organ involved in the regulation of insulin sensitivity, thermogenesis, immunity, and inflammation. There are anatomical, cellular, molecular and physiological differences among adipose tissues deposited in different body sites. However, current understanding of the intrinsic differences between the sub-compartments of the subcutaneous adipose tissue remains rudimentary. Here, we analyzed the genome-wide DNA methylation differences between the porcine superficial and deep <b>backfat</b> tissues using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing. We show that the genes with differentially methylated regions in their promoter are mainly involved in the processes of “lipid metabolism” and “regulation of immune-related cytokines”. Compared with the deep <b>backfat</b> tissue, the promoters of genes related to the ‘positive regulation of cytokine production’ were significantly hypermethylated in the superficial <b>backfat</b> tissue, which reflects the intrinsic functional and metabolic differences between the sub-compartments of the subcutaneous adipose tissue. This study provides epigenetic evidence for functionally relevant methylation differences between different layers of porcine <b>backfat</b> tissues...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{construct}} a performance index, {{that could be used}} in field testing of young breeding pigs, samples of gilts and of boars from the Dutch Landvace breed and the Dutch Yorkshire breed were measured 3 or 2 times. The sample sizes varied from 150 to 286. The index chosen was a linear combination of 2 scores: a score for weight and a score for <b>backfat</b> thickness. The score for weight was based on the « average » regression of weight on age within animals and the score for <b>backfat</b> thickness on the « average regression of <b>backfat</b> thickness on weight within animals. The index distribution was scaled in such a way that the index values could vary between o (bad) and 20 (very good). For practical use the index values were tabulated. For each age class the corresponding index value can be read from these tables for each combination of weight and <b>backfat</b> thickness. The repeatability of the index was in the order of. 85, so it was concluded that for farm testing one measurement would suffice...|$|E
40|$|A {{mixture of}} barrows and gilts as fed for four trials {{over two years}} in bedded hoop {{structures}} and a confinement building with slotted floors. When the central Iowa summer and winter feeding periods for two years were combined, the trials showed that as expected the barrows grew faster, had thicker <b>backfat,</b> smaller loin muscle areas, and lower percentage of lean than the gilts. The hoop-reared barrows and gilts grew 3 % faster, but had thicker <b>backfat</b> (7. 9 % more for barrows and 6. 5 % for gilts) and 5 % smaller loin muscle areas {{than their counterparts in}} confinement. The hoop barrows and gilts were 1. 3 percentage units less lean than the confinement barrows and gilts. During the summer, the pigs in hoops grew faster than the pigs in confinement. During the winter the growth rate was similar. These trends were consistent for both barrows and gilts. However, during the summer, the barrows had 10. 6 % thicker <b>backfat</b> and the gilts had 11. 1 % thicker <b>backfat</b> than their counterparts in confinement. In winter, the hoop barrows had 5. 2 % thicker <b>backfat</b> than the confinement barrows, but the gilts’ <b>backfat</b> was similar. Also, during the summer, hoop barrows and gilts had 4. 5 – 4. 7 % smaller loin muscle areas than their counterparts in confinement. During the winter, the hoop barrows and gilts had 5. 7 % smaller loin muscle areas than their counterparts in confinement. Therefore, during the summer, barrows and gilts had 1. 6 – 1. 7 percentage units less calculated lean than pigs in confinement.

40|$|Extending grazing {{into the}} winter, {{as opposed to}} feeding of {{harvested}} forages, can increase the sustainability of ranching in the western US. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the economic value of grazing stockpiled forage kochia (Kochia prostrata [L. ] Scrad.) and crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum [Fisch. Ex Link] Schultes) during the fall and winter. Changes in cow body weight, body condition score, and ultrasound <b>backfat</b> were compared for late-gestation cows grazing forage kochia–crested wheatgrass pastures vs. those fed alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) hay in drylot. The study was conducted from early November to late January for 2 consecutive years near Promontory, Utah. Forage availability and nutritional quality were monitored throughout the experiment. Cows grazing stockpiled forages did not receive any protein or energy supplements. Forage kochia comprised approximately 70 % of available forage, with November crude protein content of 116 and 76 g·kg− 1 in years 1 and 2, respectively. Nutritional quality declined throughout the season, presumably mostly because of removal of higher-quality forage by preferential grazing as opposed to weathering. Averaged over years, cows grazing forage kochia–grass gained body weight (19 kg), increased in body condition (0. 3 points), and maintained <b>backfat</b> thickness, finishing well within the range considered optimum for onset of calving and return to estrus. Pasture- vs. drylot-fed cows did not differ with regard to changes in body weight or body condition score. Both treatments increased <b>backfat</b> in year 1, when initial <b>backfat</b> was less than 0. 5 cm, but both treatments resulted in loss of <b>backfat</b> in year 2, when initial <b>backfat</b> was greater than 1. 0 cm. Grazing was more economical, costing $ 0. 24 ·cow− 1 ·d− 1 less than feeding alfalfa hay in drylot. Forage kochia can be used on western rangelands to extend grazing into the fall and winter, thereby improving the profitability of beef production...|$|E
40|$|Four {{groups of}} {{yearling}} heifers representing different frame sizes—small, medium, and large Angus and medium Simmental—were fed high-grain finishing diets to average Low Choice quality grade. Half the heifers were implanted with estrogen and trenbolone acetate. <b>Backfat</b> and ribeye area were measured by ultrasound four {{times during the}} study to assess growth of muscle and fat. Increasing frame size resulted in increased feed intake, greater rates of gain, and a trend towards reduced feed conversion. Greater returns would have been realized {{from each of the}} four groups had they been sold in a premium market based on yield grade rather than the conventional grade and yield market. Increasing frame size resulted in greater returns to the value-based market. Implants increased rate of gain and improved feed conversion but did not result in significantly greater returns to the value-based market compared with the grade and yield market. Ribeye area and <b>backfat</b> increased with body weight and time on feed. Increase in ribeye area was linear with time, whereas accumulation of <b>backfat</b> was exponential. Rate of increase in area of ribeye tended to increase and <b>backfat</b> tended to decrease as frame size increased. Implants increased rate of increase in ribeye area but had no effect on rate of deposition of subcutaneous fat. Equations describing growth of ribeye area and <b>backfat</b> for each group predicted average growth for the heifers but did not predict growth of individual heifers. Final carcass yield grade was related to initial thickness of <b>backfat</b> but not to initial ribeye area. These results indicate that the type of cattle selected to be fed for a premium market based on yield grade is important {{to the success of the}} program. More work is needed to develop growth equations from ultrasound measurements, but ultrasound will likely be a useful tool in selecting feeder cattle for a value-based market...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 684 sows from {{breeding}} groups over six weeks {{were used to}} compare three methods of feeding during gestation and to assess the subsequent effects on lactation performance. Control gilts and sows were fed according to body condition based {{on a scale of}} 1 to 5, (1 =thin, 5 =fat). Sows were visually assessed for body condition at breeding and were assigned a daily feed allowance to achieve a body condition score of 3 at farrowing. Sow body condition was evaluated every two weeks throughout gestation, and feed allowance was adjusted as required. Treatment two used feeding levels based on <b>backfat</b> thickness (measured between d 0 and 5 after breeding) and weight at weaning for sows or weight at service for gilts. Feed allowance was calculated to achieve a target <b>backfat</b> of 19 mm at farrowing. Sow feeding level remained constant from d 0 to 101 of gestation. Feed allowances were based on modeled calculations of energy and nutrient requirements to achieve target sow maternal weight and <b>backfat</b> gain. Treatment three was identical to treatment two except that feeding pattern was altered for thin sows and gilts (21 mm) but no difference in the percentage of thin sows ( 21 mm) at farrowing compared to sows with < 21 mm. The high proportion of sows in the optimum <b>backfat</b> category demonstrates that feeding based on <b>backfat</b> and body weight has potential for facilitating more precise gestation feeding...|$|E
