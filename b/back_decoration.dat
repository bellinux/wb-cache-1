5000|$|Within the United States, a {{significant}} chapel to Our Lady of Siluva is {{located within the}} Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. [...] The Lithuanian emigre and refugee community in the United States, {{under the leadership of}} Bishop Vincent Brizgys, organized in 1963 for establishment of this Siluva Chapel, which was dedicated in 1966. It displays the stunning artistry of Lithuanian artists in exile at that time, due to Soviet occupation and repression of Lithuania during and following World War II. Vytautus Kasuba based his statue of Our Lady of Siluva with Christ Child on written accounts of witnesses from 1608. Mosaics by Vytautas Jonynas depict the religious and cultural history of Lithuania in two large mosaic panels in the side walls of the chapel, one showing the traditional image of the [...] "Rūpintojėlis" [...] or Christ the Worrier, and the second depicting information about the Lithuanian prince and saint, Casimir. Mosaics and stained glass by Albinas Elskus decorate the golden ceiling with four images of the Madonna from Lithuanian churches, the altar frontispiece showing traditional Lithuanian wayside crosses and the altar <b>back</b> <b>decoration</b> with blue and golden aura about the statue of Our Lady of Siluva.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the second}} half, Wakefield kicked a 27-yard field goal. Two forward passes help Vanderbilt reach the spot. Later, McKibbon threw a pass which gained 18 yards, and then threw {{another one of}} 10 yards, to Reese, who ran in the score. [...] "It was the best coached team we saw this year," [...] said the Minnesota newspapermen. Blinkey Horn, sportswriter for the Nashville Tennessean, {{reported}} the jubilance following the win: Those strife scorned but undying traditions of the Southland brought Vanderbilt to a 16-0 triumph over Minnesota in Memorial Stadium here today. After {{more than half a}} century, the charge of Pickett's men at Gettysburg was re-enacted. The same matchless courage which guided the ragged Rebel band up those shell-ton heights, led the Commodores to conquest.It was the first victory of a Vanderbilt eleven ever attained across the line which divorces Dixie from the North. Mirrored here on Yankee sod today was that unconquerable spirit which enabled forefathers of the Commodores back in '63 to jest through a tempest of musketry and canister and grape.Vanderbilt won because its play reflected all the legends, all the chivalry, all the courage of Southern history. Because its spirit never for a second faltered. Because it grinned at frowning barriers and went through. Because its valor could not be scorned by the flame of that attack which burned Illinois to a crisp a week ago. The team, which stopped Red Grange, was stopped by a spirit immune to any ingredient of defeat.Wakefield chose his plays with excellent judgement. His tackling forced the Gophers frequently to take time out , and he repeatedly threw Minnesota back for losses. There is a sketchy chronicle of the score incubation. But it was the Commodore defense which stripped naked the laurel tree to adorn Bob Rives, Neil Cargile, and all the rest. Bob Rives climbed to the crux {{many times in the past}} to bring <b>back</b> <b>decoration</b> from gridiron gods. His other upward journeys were trips to the crest of a molehill. This day he reached Mt. Everest.Outplayed were the Gophers. Bill Spaulding, Minnesota mentor, graciously conceded that. But above all, the Gophers were outfought. The Gophers were out-kicked and out-passed. Tom Ryan booted his to the loftiest heights his toe has ever led him. Fred McKibbon left Minneapolis dizzy with his crafty timing of aerial shots.All restraint fled yesterday afternoon as a telegraph wire flashed to Vanderbilt Stadium the news that a Commodore team had won its most glorious victory of a decade. Man became monkey. He sprang into the air, and wrapped his prehensile tail around an imaginary coconut tree, and tried to scream the stars into alarm.Vanderbilt, the under-favored, became Commodore the triumph, the king of all sons, charted or uncharted. Vanderbilt had won! Oh, boy! Those were just the 4,500 who came to the stadium and volunteered heroically to stand by the old ship, sink or float. When the news flashed through the streets, 123,000 men, women, and children took the cry. This is the directory census of the Nashville directory. That is how many peopled joined in the mad hallelujah. An extravagant estimate? But last night even Davidson County wasn't big enough to dam the surging emotions of a populace gone victory mad.College hall, out on Vanderbilt campus, it an old historic building. This stone foundation has withstood the cries of victory and the groans of defeat for, lo, these many years. But last night its old firm foundation faced a new crisis. Hundreds of its undergraduates, post-graduates, and non-graduates massed in front of its portals with song such as never known, and in reparation for a parade that will be remembered here long after other parades will have been forgotten.|$|E

His role in Kingdom Hearts is to help guide the protagonist, Sora, in his battle (with other Final Fantasy characters) against the Heartless. Although Squall's appearance and age differ (he is 25 in Kingdom Hearts and 17 in Final Fantasy VIII), his personality remains the same.

6000|$|... 179. Now, {{there is}} nothing which {{requires}} study so close, or experiment so frequent, as the proper designing of ornament. For its use and position some definite rules may be given; but, when the space and position have been determined, the lines of curvature, the breadth, depth, and sharpness of the shadows to be obtained, the junction of the parts of a group, and the general expression, will present questions for the solution of which the study of years will sometimes scarcely be sufficient;[34] for they depend upon {{the feeling of the}} eye and hand, and {{there is nothing}} like perfection in decoration, nothing which, in all probability, might not, by farther consideration, be improved. Now, in cases in which the outline and larger masses are determined by situation, the architect will frequently find it necessary to fall <b>back</b> upon his <b>decorations,</b> as the only means of obtaining character; and that which before was an unmeaning lump of jagged freestone, will become a part of expression, an accessory of beautiful design, varied in its form, and delicate in its effect. Then, instead of shrinking from his bits of ornament, as from things which will give him trouble to invent, and will answer no other purpose than that of occupying what would otherwise have looked blank, the designer will view them as an efficient corps de reserve, to be brought up when the eye comes to close quarters with the edifice, to maintain and deepen the impression it has previously received. Much more time will be spent in the conception, much more labor in the execution, of such meaning ornaments, but both will be well spent and well rewarded.|$|R

Ted brings a beer back up to the apartment to offer as an apology. When he opens the door, he finds that Lily has taken all the Christmas decorations away from their apartment. Ted wants to make sure the winter wonderland will be there when Marshall gets back from the library. Ted tries to call Lily but with no result. As Robin and a very sick Barney stack at the apartment Ted decides to go to Lily's apartment to apologize. He tricks her into thinking he's the pizza delivery guy so he's able to get her to open the door to her tiny, crappy, cramped NY apartment. He says he's sorry that he called her [...] "a grinch", but Lily works out that he is faking an apology, and is clearly still angry with her. She asks Ted why he won't forgive her when she has already apologised to Marshall. He replies that she never apologised to him, and that her abrupt departure and lack of contact had hurt him as well. He and Lily get into another argument, when her power suddenly goes off, with Lily saying that Ted pissed off the [...] "big man up stairs," [...] her super, that lives above her. He then tells Lily that she can take the <b>decorations</b> <b>back</b> to his and Marshall's apartment because he's going to visit his cousin's family in Staten Island. Marshall comes back home to the apartment, claiming he blew off his paper, but he had been spending hours tracking down his gift for Lily. He finds the winter wonderland intact and no knowledge of what happened earlier in the day.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} art in many {{cultures}} shows a series of wave-like trends where the level of ornament used increases over a period, before a sharp reaction returns to plainer forms, after which ornamentation gradually increases again. The pattern is especially clear in post-Roman European art, where the highly ornamented Insular art of the Book of Kells and other manuscripts influenced continental Europe, but the classically inspired Carolingian and Ottonian art largely replaced it. Ornament increased over the Romanesque and Gothic periods, but was greatly reduced in Early Renaissance styles, again under classical influence. Another period of increase, in Northern Mannerism, the Baroque and Rococo, was checked by Neoclassicism and the Romantic period, before resuming in the later 19th century Victorian decorative arts and their continental equivalents, to be decisively reduced by the Arts and Crafts movement and then Modernism. [...] The detailed study of Eurasian ornamental forms was begun by Alois Riegl in his formalist study Stilfragen: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik (Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament) of 1893, who in the process developed his influential concept of the Kunstwollen. [...] Riegl traced formalistic continuity and development in decorative plant forms from Ancient Egyptian art and other ancient Near Eastern civilizations through the classical world to the arabesque of Islamic art. While {{the concept of the}} Kunstwollen has few followers today, his basic analysis of the development of forms has been confirmed and refined by the wider corpus of examples known today. Jessica Rawson has recently extended the analysis to cover Chinese art, which Riegl did not cover, tracing many elements of Chinese <b>decoration</b> <b>back</b> to the same tradition; the shared background helping to make the assimilation of Chinese motifs into Persian art after the Mongol invasion harmonious and productive.|$|R
5000|$|The arabesque {{developed}} {{out of the}} long-established {{traditions of}} plant-based scroll ornament in the cultures {{taken over by the}} early Islamic conquests. Early Islamic art, for example in the famous 8th century mosaics of the Great Mosque of Damascus, often contained plant-scroll patterns, in that case by Byzantine artists in their usual style. The plants most often used are stylized versions of the acanthus, with its emphasis on leafy forms, and the vine, with an equal emphasis on twining stems. The evolution of these forms into a distinctive Islamic type was complete by the 11th century, having begun in the 8th or 9th century in works like the Mshatta Facade. In the process of development the plant forms became increasing simplified and stylized. [...] The relatively abundant survivals of stucco reliefs from the walls of palaces (but not mosques) in Abbasid Samarra, the Islamic capital between 836 and 892, provide examples of three styles, Styles A, B, and C, though more than one of these may appear on the same wall, and their chronological sequence is not certain. [...] Though the broad outline of the process is generally agreed, there is a considerable diversity of views held by specialist scholars on detailed issues concerning the development, categorization and meaning of the arabesque. [...] The detailed study of Islamic arabesque forms was begun by Alois Riegl in his formalist study Stilfragen: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik (Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament) of 1893, who in the process developed his influential concept of the Kunstwollen.
