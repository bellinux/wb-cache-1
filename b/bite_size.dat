25|$|The common {{earthworm}} is {{a universal}} bait for fresh water angling. Grubs and maggots are also excellent bait when trout fishing. Grasshoppers, bees and even ants are also used as bait for trout in their season, although many anglers believe that trout or salmon roe is superior to any other bait. In lakes in southern climates such as Florida, fish such as sunfish will take bread bait. Bread bait is {{a small amount of}} bread, often moistened by saliva, balled up to a small size that is <b>bite</b> <b>size</b> to small fish.|$|E

25|$|Fronsac is {{initially}} {{skeptical about the}} beast's existence, since survivors describe it as much larger than any wolf he has ever seen. However, by studying the <b>bite</b> <b>size</b> on {{a victim of the}} beast, he deduces that it must weigh more than 500lb (227kg). Captain Duhamel, an army officer leading the hunt for the beast, has killed dozens of ordinary wolves, but has not come close to the actual killer. While staying in Gévaudan, Fronsac romances Marianne de Morangias, the daughter of a local count, whose brother, Jean-François, was also an avid hunter and a world traveler, before losing one arm to a lion in Africa. Fronsac is also intrigued by Sylvia, an Italian courtesan at the local brothel.|$|E

40|$|Nguni {{goats and}} Boer goats, which are farmed {{together}} in the savannas of the Eastern Cape Province, depend on the same feed resources. The feeding height intake rates and preferences {{of one of their}} most preferred browse species, Grewia occidentalis L. (Tiliaceae), were studied in order to indirectly determine resource partitioning between these goat breeds on the basis of feeding height. The two hypotheses tested were that taller Boer goats feed at higher levels than do Nguni goats and that both breeds have feeding height preferences that are related to differences in intake rates. Four individuals of each breed were fed branches attached to a height foraging board. The two breeds showed no particular height preference in either season. Bite rates varied with feeding height, while <b>bite</b> <b>sizes</b> and intake rates increased with feeding height. Boer goats had lower bite rates compared to Nguni goats, although both breeds achieved similar <b>bite</b> <b>sizes</b> and intake rates. <b>Bites</b> <b>sizes</b> and intake rates for both breeds were higher in summer than in winter, possibly because more browse biomass was available per branch in summer than in winter since G. occidentalis is deciduous. There was no evidence to support that feeding height preference was related to differences in intake rates. It is concluded that Boer goats may compete for forage resources during times of resource limitation. Thus, Nguni goats might be a more favourable breed in semi-arid savannas because of their smaller body-size and, therefore, absolute nutrient requirements as well as their better reproductive performance compared to Boer goats...|$|R
