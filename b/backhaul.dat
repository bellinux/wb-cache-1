40|$|Truck <b>backhauling</b> reduces empty truck-miles {{by having}} drivers haul loads on trips {{back to their}} home terminal. This paper 1) {{examines}} the impact on <b>backhauling</b> opportunities of terminal locations and directional imbalances {{in the flow of}} freight from the terminals, and 2) develops a method for determining which truckloads should be <b>backhauled.</b> <b>Backhauling</b> is studied for two terminals sending full truckloads to many customers under steady-state conditions. This research develops two <b>backhauling</b> models. The first is a continuous model that makes simplifying assumptions about customer locations and travel distances. It results in formulae showing that 1) savings from <b>backhauling</b> increase at a decreasing rate as the directional flow of freight between two terminals becomes more balanced and 2) <b>backhauling</b> is an important, but often ignored, factor in terminal (e. g. trucking terminal, warehouse, or plant) location and supplier selection decisions. The second model is a more general discrete model that determines which loads should be <b>backhauled</b> to minimize empty truck-miles. ...|$|R

40|$|Truck <b>backhauling</b> reduces empty truck-miles {{by having}} drivers haul loads on trips {{back to their}} home terminal. This paper {{develops}} a model to help coordinate <b>backhauling</b> between many (more than two) terminals. Two mathematical programming formulations of this <b>backhauling</b> problem are given. One formulates it as a "matching" problem {{that leads to a}} heuristic for solving the very large <b>backhauling</b> problems that arise in practice. Using Lagrangian relaxation, the other formulation allows a very tight bound on the optimal solution to be calculated. The quality of the heuristic solution can be determined by comparison with this bound. A large scale example based on actual truck shipments demonstrates how the model might be used in planning truck <b>backhauling.</b> For this example, the heuristic yields a solution within 1 % of optimal. ...|$|R

25|$|On 8 October 2009, Virgin Media began {{trials to}} deliver its TV and {{broadband}} services {{at up to}} 50 Mbit/s downstream via a VDSL2 line to a roadside cabinet. The cabinets were linked to Virgin Media <b>backhaul</b> via new fibre laid by Vtesse Networks through BT's local exchange, 5km away.

The satellites bounce signals from a satellite dish on the premises to an earth station, known as a 'gateway'; the gateway is then connected to a POI via a fibre <b>backhaul.</b> The satellite design was 'not easy', because the required coverage is about 'five per cent of the world's land mass' containing 'at least 200,000 premises' spread across 'over 7,000 kilometres' of area between Cocos Islands and Norfolk Island.|$|E

30|$|Other {{important}} research {{issues for}} multi-tier HetNets include mobility management and load balancing via dynamic BS association and admission control [51 – 56]. To effectively manage cross-tier interference and perform load balancing {{in the dense}} HetNet, distributed solutions using the self-optimization network (SON) techniques are desirable, which typically require reliable and low-delay <b>backhauls</b> for {{a large number of}} small cells (i.e., pico and femto cells). High-speed <b>backhauls</b> are also critical to exchange the large volume of data between small cells and the core network. While low-cost <b>backhauls</b> using existing DSL can be used for indoor femtocells, this solution would not lead to a satisfactory QoS and performance. Indeed, <b>backhauls</b> remain {{to be one of the}} most critical issues, which hinders the successful widespread adoption of the dense small-cell network.|$|R
25|$|Iridium routes {{phone calls}} through space. In {{addition}} to {{communicating with the}} satellite phones in its footprint, each satellite in the constellation also maintains contact with two to four adjacent satellites, and routes data between them, to effectively create a large mesh network. There are several earth stations which link to the network through the satellites visible to them. The space-based <b>backhaul</b> routes outgoing phone call packets through space {{to one of the}} earth station downlinks ("feeder links"). Station-to-station calls from one satellite phone to another can be routed directly through space without going through an earth station. As satellites leave the area of an earth station, the routing tables are updated and packets headed for the earth station are forwarded to the next satellite just coming into view of the earth station. Communication between satellites and earth stations is at 20 and 30GHz.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of data access and user experience result in deployment {{of new technologies}} (3 G, LTE, WiMAX, Cognitive Radio), Long Term Evolution (LTE) {{is one of them}} which promises to fulfill the variable demand of subscribers through small cells instead of macro cells. The <b>backhauling</b> of the small cells in densely populated urban area is again a very difficult task to handle with Government regulations (eccentricities) and restrictions. Current trend in <b>backhauling</b> of small cells used fiber optic and twisted pair media result in increase in operational and deployment cost takes very long time and require permission from Govt. to deploy the cables, even Line of Sight (LoS) wireless link in densely urban area is not easy to achieve and non Line of Sight (NLoS) link result in decrease in power (signal strength) and require intelligent planning and difficult to operate and maintain. At the same time existing of new technologies in limited spectrum and to provide higher date rates for data traffic is again a challenge for mobile operators. The one possible solution to <b>backhauling</b> of small cells in NLoS situation is through cognitive radio spectrum sensing. In this thesis work the concept of spectrum optimization in small cells <b>backhauling</b> and challenges to achieve this have been introduced. Optimization has been done for different RF parameters and link budget of different networks in cognitive domain has been calculated and best possible network for <b>backhauling</b> of small cells is selected to enhance user demand. Dedicated link between the transmitter and receiver is not always the case. To cater for, the later Non-Line-of-Sight communication is opted for especially in scenarios which include urban, dense urban or where re-planning is done on a constant basis to provide coverage to tricky areas. To address this concept of small cells was introduced but along with it <b>backhauling</b> emerged as a major problem. Wired and wireless solutions have been closely observed and out of which microwave <b>backhauling</b> stood out. With NLoS, propagation impairments get mounted and expected outcomes are hindered. An alternate to it as mentioned in our thesis is the approach of optimization of cognitive radio in NLoS <b>backhauling</b> of small cells. This approach has the potential of lowering the NLoS propagation impairments which include diffraction, reflection and scattering. At the same time it is an answer to cost, coverage and capacity. 0046 - 727607055 (Paresh Kumar Lakhani) 0046 - 764468661 (Ajay Gul) 0046 - 761687555 (Fahad Naveed...|$|R
