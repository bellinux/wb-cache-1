50|$|<b>Bifeprunox</b> has a novel {{mechanism}} of action. Conventional antipsychotics are classed into typical and atypical. The typical antipsychotics, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, are potent D2 receptor antagonists.

5000|$|Six months later, another University of Minnesota {{research}} subject, Robert Huber, revealed {{publicly that}} he had been recruited into a study of an unapproved antipsychotic drug, <b>bifeprunox,</b> under circumstances similar to those of Dan Markingson.

[...] In November, Niki Gjere, a clinical nurse specialist at University of Minnesota Medical Center at Fairview, told Fox 9 News that she had objected to Markingson’s enrollment in the CAFÉ study in 2003 but her objections were ignored. She also said that nurses were “badgered and pressured” into finding subjects for psychiatric drug studies.|$|E
50|$|N-Desmethylclozapine (NDMC), or norclozapine, {{is a major}} active {{metabolite}} of the atypical {{antipsychotic drug}} clozapine. Unlike clozapine, it possesses intrinsic activity at the D2/D3 receptors, and acts as a weak partial agonist at these sites similarly to aripiprazole and <b>bifeprunox.</b> Notably, NDMC {{has also been shown}} to act as a potent and efficacious agonist at the M1 and δ-opioid receptors, unlike clozapine as well. It was hypothesized that on account of these unique actions, NDMC might underlie the clinical superiority of clozapine over other antipsychotics. However, clinical trials found NMDC itself ineffective in the treatment of schizophrenia. This may be because it possesses relatively low D2/D3 occupancy compared to 5-HT2 (<15% versus 64-79% at a dose of 10-60 mg/kg s.c. in animal studies). In any case, though not useful in the treatment of positive symptoms on its own, it cannot be ruled out that NDMC may contribute to the efficacy of clozapine on cognitive and/or negative symptoms.|$|E
40|$|Following on {{the success}} of Aripiprazole with its high {{clinical}} efficacy and minimal side effects, further antipsychotic drugs (such as <b>Bifeprunox)</b> have been developed based on the same dopamine D 2 partial agonist pharmacological profile as Aripiprazole. However clinical trials of <b>Bifeprunox</b> have found differing results to that of its predecessor, without the same significant clinical efficacy. This study has therefore investigated the different effects of 10 week treatment with Aripiprazole (0. 75 mg/kg, 3 times per day), <b>Bifeprunox</b> (0. 8 mg/kg, 3 times per day) and Haloperidol (0. 1 mg/kg, 3 times per day) on body weight gain, food and water intake, white fat mass, and 8 week treatment on locomotor activity. Treatment with <b>Bifeprunox</b> was found to significantly reduce all of the measured parameters except white fat mass compared to the control group. However, Aripiprazole and Haloperidol treatment reduced water intake compared to the control, without any significant effects on the other measured parameters. These findings further demonstrate the potential pharmacological differences between Aripiprazole and <b>Bifeprunox,</b> and identify potential weight loss side effects and increased anxiety behaviour with <b>Bifeprunox</b> treatment...|$|E
40|$|Aripiprazole is a wide-used {{antipsychotic}} drug with therapeutic effects on {{both positive and}} negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and reduced side-effects. Although aripiprazole was developed as a dopamine D 2 receptor (D 2 R) partial agonist, all other D 2 R partial agonists that aimed to mimic aripiprazole failed to exert therapeutic effects in clinic. The present in vivo study aimed to investigate the effects of aripiprazole on the D 2 R downstream cAMP-PKA and Akt-GSK 3 β signalling pathways in comparison with a D 2 R antagonist - haloperidol and a D 2 R partial agonist - <b>bifeprunox.</b> Rats were injected once with aripiprazole (0. 75 mg/kg, i. p.), <b>bifeprunox</b> (0. 8 mg/kg, i. p.), haloperidol (0. 1 mg/kg, i. p.) or vehicle. Five brain regions - the prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), caudate putamen (CPu), ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) were collected. The protein levels of PKA, Akt and GSK 3 β were measured by Western Blotting; the cAMP levels were examined by ELISA tests. The results showed that aripiprazole presented similar acute effects on PKA expression to haloperidol, but not <b>bifeprunox,</b> in the CPU and VTA. Additionally, aripiprazole was able to increase the phosphorylation of GSK 3 β in the PFC, NAc, CPu and SN, respectively, which cannot be achieved by <b>bifeprunox</b> and haloperidol. These results suggested that acute treatment of aripiprazole had differential effects on the cAMP-PKA and Akt-GSK 3 β signalling pathways from haloperidol and <b>bifeprunox</b> in these brain areas. This study further indicated that, by comparison with <b>bifeprunox,</b> the unique pharmacological profile of aripiprazole may be attributed to the relatively lower intrinsic activity at D 2 R...|$|E
40|$|Environmental stimuli {{repeatedly}} {{associated with}} the self-administered drugs may acquire motivational importance. Because dopamine (DA) D(2) /D(3) partial agonists and D(3) antagonists interfere with the ability of drug-associated cues to induce drug-seeking behaviour, {{the present study investigated}} whether <b>bifeprunox,</b> 7 -[4 -([1, 1 'biphenyl]- 3 -ylmethyl) - 1 -piperazinyl]- 2 (3 H) -benzoxazolone mesylate), a high-affinity partial agonist of the D(2) subfamily of DA receptors and of serotonin(1 A) receptors, influences reinstatement of drug-associated cue-induced nicotine-seeking behaviour. The study also explored whether <b>bifeprunox</b> reduced motivated behaviour by evaluating its effects on reinstatement induced by stimuli conditioned to sucrose. To verify whether <b>bifeprunox</b> interferes with the primary reinforcing properties of either drug or sucrose, we compared its effects on nicotine self-administration and on sucrose-reinforced behaviour. Different groups of experimentally naïve, food-restricted Wistar rats were trained to associate a discriminative stimulus with response-contingent availability of nicotine or sucrose and tested for reinstatement after extinction of nicotine or sucrose-reinforced behaviour. <b>Bifeprunox</b> (4 - 16  µg/kg, s. c.) dose-dependently attenuated the response-reinstating effects of nicotine-associated cues. Higher doses (64 - 250  µg/kg, s. c.) reduced spontaneous locomotor activity and suppressed operant responding induced by sucrose-associated cues and by the primary reinforcing properties of nicotine or sucrose. Provided they can be extrapolated to abstinent human addicts, these results suggest the potential therapeutic use of partial DA D(2) receptor agonist to prevent cue-controlled nicotine-seeking and relapse. The profile of action of high doses of <b>bifeprunox</b> remains to be examined for potential sedation or anhedonia effects...|$|E
40|$|Aripiprazole and the {{candidate}} antipsychotics, S 33592, <b>bifeprunox,</b> N-desmethylclozapine (NDMC) and preclamol, are partial agonists at D(2) receptors. Herein, we examined their actions at D(2 L) and D(3) receptors expressed separately or together in COS- 7 cells. In D(2 L) receptor-expressing cells co-transfected with (D(3) receptor-insensitive) chimeric adenylate cyclase-V/VI, drugs reduced forskolin-stimulated cAMP production by approximately 20 % versus quinpirole (48 %). Further, quinpirole-induced inhibition was blunted by aripiprazole and S 33592, confirming partial agonist properties. In cells co-transfected with {{equal amounts of}} D(2 L) and D(3) receptors (1 : 1), efficacies of aripiprazole and S 33592 were attenuated. Further, in cells co-transfected with D(2 L) and an excess of D(3) receptors (1 : 3), aripiprazole and S 33592 were completely inactive, and they abolished the actions of quinpirole. Likewise, <b>bifeprunox,</b> NDMC and preclamol lost agonist properties in cells co-transfected with D(2 L) and D(3) receptors. Accordingly, at split D(2 trunk) /D(3 tail) and D(3 trunk) /D(2 tail) chimeras, agonist actions of quinpirole were blocked by aripiprazole and S 33592 that, like <b>bifeprunox,</b> NDMC and preclamol, were inactive alone. Conversely, when a 12 amino acid sequence in the third intracellular loop of D(3) receptors {{was replaced by the}} homologous sequence of D(2 L) receptors, aripiprazole, S 33592, <b>bifeprunox,</b> NDMC and preclamol inhibited cAMP formation by approximately 20 % versus quinpirole (42 %). Moreover, at D(2 L) receptor-expressing cells co-transfected with modified D(3 i 3 (D 2)) receptors, drugs behaved as partial agonists. To summarize, low efficacy agonist actions of aripiprazole, S 33592, <b>bifeprunox,</b> NDMC and preclamol at D(2 L) receptors are abrogated upon co-expression of D(3) receptors, probably due to physical association and weakened coupling efficacy. These findings have implications for the functional profiles of antipsychotics...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} aripiprazole, S 33592, <b>bifeprunox,</b> N-desmethylclozapine and {{preclamol}} acting as partial agonists on recombinant D(2 L) and D(3) receptors expressed both separately and concomitantly in COS- 7 cells are evaluated here. Aripiprazole, S 33592, <b>bifeprunox,</b> N-desmethylclozapine and preclamol behave as partial agonists on D(2 L) receptors coupled with adenylyl cyclase, but they behave as antagonists on co-expression of D(3) with D(2 L) receptors. These data raise the intriguing hypothesis that antipsychotic actions of "partial agonists" such as aripiprazole may not reflect inefficient stimulation of D(2) and/or D(3) receptors but, by analogy with other antipsychotics, may instead represent a blockade of D(2) /D(3) heterodimers (and/or D(3) receptors) that are "weakly" coupled to transduction mechanisms postsynaptically of the dopaminergic pathway...|$|E
40|$|Aripiprazole is a D 2 -like {{receptor}} (D 2 R) partial agonist with a favourable clinical profile. Previous investigations {{indicated that}} acute and short-term administration of aripiprazole had effects on PKA activity, GSK 3 β-dependent pathways, GABAA receptors, NMDA receptor and CREB 1 in the brain. Since antipsychotics are used chronically in clinics, {{the present study}} investigated the long-term effects of chronic oral aripiprazole treatment on these cellular signalling pathways, in comparison with haloperidol (a D 2 R antagonist) and <b>bifeprunox</b> (a potent D 2 R partial agonist). We found that the Akt-GSK 3 β pathway was activated by aripiprazole and <b>bifeprunox</b> in the prefrontal cortex; NMDA NR 2 A levels were reduced by aripiprazole and haloperidol. In the nucleus accumbens, all three drugs increased Akt-GSK 3 β signalling; in addition, both aripiprazole and haloperidol, but not <b>bifeprunox,</b> increased the expression of Dvl- 3, β-catenin and GABAA receptors, NMDA receptor subunits, as well as CREB 1 phosphorylation levels. The results suggest that chronic oral administration of aripiprazole affects schizophrenia-related cellular signalling pathways and markers (including Akt-GSK 3 β signalling, Dvl-GSK 3 β-β-catenin signalling, GABAA receptor, NMDA receptor and CREB 1) in a brain-region-dependent manner; the selective effects of aripiprazole on these signalling pathways might be associated with its unique clinical effects...|$|E

Rats were orally administrated aripiprazole (0. 75 mg/kg), <b>bifeprunox</b> (0. 8 mg/kg), haloperidol (0. 1 mg/kg) or vehicle three times per day for one week. The levels of protein kinase B (Akt), p-Akt, GSK 3 β, p-GSK 3 β, dishevelled (Dvl) - 3, and β-catenin were measured by Western Blots. Aripiprazole increased GSK 3 β phosphorylation in the PFC and NAc, respectively, while haloperidol elevated it in the NAc only. However, Akt activity was not changed by any of these drugs. Additionally, both aripiprazole and haloperidol, but not <b>bifeprunox,</b> increased the expression of Dvl- 3 and β-catenin in the NAc. The present study suggests that activation of GSK 3 β phosphorylation in the PFC and NAc {{may be involved in}} the clinical profile of aripiprazole; additionally, aripiprazole can increase GSK 3 β phosphorylation via the Dvl-GSK 3 β-β-catenin signalling pathway in the NAc, probably due to its relatively low intrinsic activity at D 2 Rs...|$|E

40|$|Aripiprazole is {{a unique}} {{antipsychotic}} drug with favourable therapeutic effects and improved extrapyramidal side-effects. Its partial agonism for the dopamine D 2 receptors (D 2 R) is considered {{to contribute to the}} clinical effects of aripiprazole. However, how aripiprazole regulates D 2 R-mediated cellular signalling pathways, as well as their downstream substrates, is not clear. Therefore, this thesis investigated the cellular mechanisms of aripiprazole on these signalling pathways and regulators in an animal model, by comparing aripiprazole with a D 2 R antagonist – haloperidol and a D 2 R partial agonist – <b>bifeprunox.</b> The study in Chapter 3 investigated the acute effects of aripiprazole (a single injection) on the D 2 R downstream cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase B (Akt) -glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK 3 β) signalling pathways. Aripiprazole affected PKA-C expression similarly to haloperidol, but not <b>bifeprunox,</b> in the caudate putamen (CPu) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). In addition, aripiprazole increased phosphorylation of GSK 3 β in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), CPu and substantia nigra (SN). Haloperidol also increased phosph-GSK 3 β in the NAc. These results suggest acute administration of aripiprazole affected the cAMP-PKA and Akt-GSK 3 β signalling pathways differentially from haloperidol and <b>bifeprunox</b> in various brain areas. It also indicated that its relatively low intrinsic activity for D 2 Rs might contribute to the effects of aripiprazole. The study in Chapter 4 continued {{to examine the effects of}} 1 -week aripiprazole treatment by oral administration. In addition to PKA signalling, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptors and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) were examined. The data have shown that 1 -week administration of aripiprazole elevated PKA activity by increasing the phosphorylation levels of PKA in the NAc. Aripiprazole also increased the expression of the GABAA (β- 1) receptor and CREB in the NAc. Furthermore, haloperidol elevated PKA activity in both the NAc and CPu, while haloperidol increased GABAA (β- 1) receptor expression and CREB 1 expression (not significantly) in the NAc. These findings suggest that aripiprazole might exert its clinical effects via the regulation of GABAA receptors and CREB 1 in the NAc, possibly via the D 2 R-mediated PKA signalling pathway. In the study in Chapter 5, the effects of 1 -week administration of aripiprazole on the Akt-GSK 3 β and Dvl-GSK 3 β-β-catenin signalling pathways were examined. The results demonstrated that aripiprazole increased GSK 3 β phosphorylation in the PFC, NAc and CPu, while haloperidol and <b>bifeprunox</b> had such effects only in the NAc and CPu, respectively. Additionally, both aripiprazole and haloperidol increased the expression of Dvl- 3 and β-catenin in the NAc. The studies in Chapters 4 and 5 suggest that upregulation of GABAA (β- 1) receptors and CREB 1 in the NAc, and GSK 3 β phosphorylation in the PFC and NAc may be involved in the clinical effects of aripiprazole; they further indicate that the relatively low intrinsic activity for D 2 Rs might be associated with the actions of aripiprazole. In the clinic, in order to control symptoms of schizophrenia, patients usually experience chronic antipsychotic treatment. The chronic effects of aripiprazole on the GSK 3 β- dependent signalling pathways, GABAA receptor and CREB 1 are unknown. Therefore, the effects of 10 -week administration of aripiprazole on these cellular signalling pathways and regulators were examined in Chapter 6. Administration of both aripiprazole and <b>bifeprunox</b> activated the Akt-GSK 3 β signalling in the PFC. In the NAc, chronic administration of all three drugs increased Akt-GSK 3 β signalling; while both aripiprazole and haloperidol up-regulated Dvl- 3, β-catenin and GABAA receptors, as well as CREB 1 activity. This study has confirmed the involvement of Dvl-GSK 3 β-β- catenin, GABAA receptors and CREB 1 activity in the long-term actions of aripiprazole. In brief, this thesis provided in vivo evidence that aripiprazole was able to activate the PKA, Akt-GSK 3 β and Dvl-GSK 3 β-β-catenin signalling pathways, and also up-regulate GABAA receptor expression, as well as CREB 1 activity. Moreover, by comparing aripiprazole with haloperidol and <b>bifeprunox,</b> particularly their effects in the NAc, these studies further suggest that a relatively low intrinsic activity for D 2 Rs might be the key factor for aripiprazole to exert its unique clinical effects, and for other potential D 2 R partial agonists to achieve meaningful therapeutic effects...|$|E
40|$|The GABAA {{receptor}} is {{implicated in}} the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and regulated by PKA signalling. Current antipsychotics bind with D 2 -like receptors, but not the GABAA receptor.

This study investigated the effects of antipsychotics in modulating D 2 -mediated PKA signalling and its downstream GABAA receptors and CREB 1. Rats were treated orally with aripiprazole (0. 75 mg/kg, ter in die (t. i. d.)), <b>bifeprunox</b> (0. 8 mg/kg, t. i. d.), haloperidol (0. 1 mg/kg, t. i. d.) or vehicle for 1 week. The levels of PKA-Cα and p-PKA in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc) and caudate putamen (CPu) were detected by Western blots. The mRNA levels of Gabrb 1, Gabrb 2, Gabrb 3 and Creb 1, and their protein expression were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blots, respectively. Aripiprazole elevated the levels of p-PKA and the ratio of p-PKA/PKA in the NAc, but not the PFC and CPu. Correlated with this elevated PKA signalling, aripiprazole elevated the mRNA and protein expression of the GABAA (β- 1) receptor and CREB 1 in the NAc. While haloperidol elevated the levels of p-PKA and the ratio of p-PKA/PKA in both NAc and CPu, it only tended to increase the expression of the GABAA (β- 1) receptor and CREB 1 in the NAc, but not the CPu. <b>Bifeprunox</b> had no effects on PKA signalling in these brain regions.
