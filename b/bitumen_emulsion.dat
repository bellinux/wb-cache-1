40|$|The {{most common}} {{way in which}} bitumen is applied to mineral {{aggregate}} substrates in road making processes {{is in the form}} of a so-called 'bitumen emulsion'. <b>Bitumen</b> <b>emulsions</b> are a dispersion of bitumen in an aqueous continuous phase, stabilised by the addition of an emulsifier. They are usually prepared as genuine emulsions at high temperatures, but applied as solid dispersions at ambient temperatures. During road making, these emulsions (or dispersions) must break over the surface of a range of mineral aggregates in a controlled manner, and hence a thorough understanding of the physicochemical properties of such emulsions, and the aggregate substrates, is required.

40|$|<b>Bitumen</b> <b>emulsions</b> {{stand for}} an {{alternative}} paving practice to the traditional hot-mix asphalts. In addition, modified <b>bitumen</b> <b>emulsions</b> show a better performance than unmodified ones. This work studies the feasibility of obtaining polyurethane modified <b>bitumen</b> <b>emulsions,</b> in which an isocyanate-functionalized polyol constitutes the bitumen modifier (in varying concentration from 1 to 4 wt. %). Storage stability and high in-service performance are evaluated by means of evolution of droplet size distribution (DSD) and rheology tests, respectively. Regarding the emulsion stability, the key factor {{seems to be the}} bitumen modifier concentration used to prepare the modified emulsions. Thus, for a selected 50 wt. % bitumen fraction, there is a limit concentration (between 1 and 2 wt. %) above which the emulsion becomes unstable under storage. Hence, this result limits the modifier content {{that can be used in}} the emulsion and the final level of modification achieved if compared to the original non-modified emulsion. On the other hand, the rheological characterization conducted on the emulsion residues at 60 ºC has shown an improved resistance to deformation. In terms of applicability, polyurethane modified bitumens allows for the obtaining of modified emulsions which can be prepared at much lower temperatures than those derived from other polymers.
