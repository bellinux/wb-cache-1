Boys' clothing from LWD is primarily shortalls, T-shirt sets and <b>bathing</b> <b>trunks.</b> An extensive babywear line is complemented with tops, skirts and dresses (primarily maxi length) for adult women.|$|E
50|$|When worn as swimsuit, trunks {{are often}} {{referred}} to as swimming trunks or <b>bathing</b> <b>trunks</b> (or with the more general term bathing suit or a synonym) and are normally shorter than board shorts, which extend to the knees. Trunks are the most popular type of male swimsuit in North America. They vary in style and design, though most are made of nylon with a mesh lining for quick drying.|$|E
40|$|Giant {{congenital}} melanocytic nevi {{are rare}} and occur in about {{one out of}} every 2, 00, 000 to 5, 00, 000 births. There is a significant association between <b>bathing</b> <b>trunk</b> nevus and neurofibromatosis and lipomatosis. Apart from this, association of <b>bathing</b> <b>trunk</b> nevus with abnormalities like spina bifida occulta, meningocele, club foot and hypertrophy or atrophy of deeper structures of a limb, have been described. We are herewith reporting two cases of <b>bathing</b> <b>trunk</b> nevi. In our first case, an eight-year-old girl presented with a <b>bathing</b> <b>trunk</b> nevus studded with multiple, large nodules. Histopathological examination of the biopsy taken from one nodule revealed features of both neurofibroma and lipoma. To the best of our knowledge, features of both these hamartomas in one nodule of a single patient are probably not reported in the literature. In our second case, a 12 -year-old girl presented with <b>bathing</b> <b>trunk</b> nevus and she had spina bifida occulta. She also had lipoma in the lesion of <b>bathing</b> <b>trunk</b> nevus. Both of our patients had satellite melanocytic nevi over the face, forearm, upper back and legs. Our second patient, in addition, had small melanocytic nevi over the medial canthus and sclerocorneal junction of the right eye. By the time this girl presented to us, the melanocytic nevus started fading in color and it had become brownish. We are reporting these cases for their peculiarities and for their rare features...|$|R

There was a mild prodromal illness and the patient was afebrile. There were minimal symptoms associated with the rash. Skin and throat swabs were negative and blood examination showed mild neutrophilia and lymphopaenia. Parvovirus B 19 IgM was detected on serology and cutaneous features resolved within 4 days. This is a further case of parvovirus B 19 infection presenting as a 2 ̆ 7 <b>bathing</b> <b>trunk</b> 2 ̆ 7 exanthem that has unique dermatologic features, including the presence of pustules and distant petechiae. © 2006 The Australasian College of Dermatologists...|$|R
5000|$|On August 21, 1976 Melanie Perkins and Andy met at {{the pool}} late in the morning. As usual, they spent the entire day playing there. [...] "It {{was the place to}} hang out if you lived in the projects," [...] Melanie says. About 4:30, she was hungry and decided to go home. Usually she walked alone to her mother's apartment, which was less than 200 yards away. But on this day, {{something}} she still can't explain made her feel afraid. She asked Andy to accompany her, but he wasn't ready to leave. So her 11-year-old brother, Jeff, walked her home. The last time Melanie saw Andy, he was sitting by the pool in his green <b>bathing</b> <b>trunks,</b> talking with friends. National Guard troops and Green Berets scoured the neighborhood later that night, truckers with CB radios rallied around and neighbors helped with the search. Dogs were brought in to sniff an abandoned dump and woods adjacent to the pool. Scuba divers dragged the nearby Shawsheen River. More than 2,000 volunteers pitched in.|$|E
50|$|Gidget {{describes}} the Kahoona's first appearance:Just then the bamboo curtain to the hut was drawn open and this bum came out. What I mean, he wasn't a bum, {{but then he}} wasn't {{exactly the kind of}} guy that would drive a girl mad with desire either. He was on the oldish side—around the end of the twenties or so. You got the impression he had just got up or something. Of course all the surfers in enclosure wore only shorts or Hawaiian-print <b>bathing</b> <b>trunks</b> but this superannuated Huckleberry Finn had on a pair of jeans that were cut off just beneath the knees and looked more like an old rag bleached by the sun. He was a real tall guy with legs of unbelievable length. Jeez, he was tanned. You've never laid your eyes on a tan like that. Like one of those suntan oil ads you see in magazines—only more so. He had a beard growth of at least three days and he stood there and scratched his stubble and had this kind of empty gaze like he was full of booze.There was something about the way the other guys greeted him that told me he was a real hotshot.|$|E
5000|$|San Francisco was {{relieved}} {{of duty in}} Hawaii in mid-August 1892 and set out for repairs at Mare Island. Following repairs, Stirling's ship joined a squadron of two other cruisers, , [...] and a gunboat, [...] bound for a large naval review at New York {{as part of the}} following year's (1893) Chicago World's Fair. At Acapulco Bay, Mexico, [...] "celebrated for its man‑eating sharks", Stirling was visiting Charleston and accepted the challenge of the Catholic chaplain to swim off the anchored ship. [...] "We donned our <b>bathing</b> <b>trunks.</b> The chaplain dove first off the gangway, and I followed him. When I struck the water, all the ghastly stories I had ever heard of sharks came into my mind. I swam swiftly back to the gangway, getting there just as (chaplain) Rainnie reached it. He said, breathlessly: 'I don't think we should put too much confidence in the Lord's being able to protect us from our own stupidity.'" [...] Back aboard, the officer of the deck pointed out several black fins where Stirling had been swimming moments earlier. During the voyage around South America and through the Straits of Magellan, the ship made ports of call at Callao, Peru, Valparaiso, Chile and Montevideo, Uruguay to show the flag and cement generally good relations [...] "where considerable American gold was spent" [...] and where the local officials lavishly entertained the Admiral and officers.|$|E
40|$|Congenital Giant Melanocytic Nevus (CGMN), {{pigmented}} lesion present since birth, {{occurs in}} 1 % of infants worldwide. Fifteen percent of CGMN are localized {{in the head}} and neck region and it can also have a <b>bathing</b> <b>trunk</b> distribution. It grows proportionally to the size of the body as the child matures and grows with variation in colour and surface texture. A 29 years old female presented to the Gynecology Out Patient Department for infertility. She also had multiple large nevi of varying sizes present since birth. The lesion was distributed all over the body. She also complained of sudden appearance of swellings at the back which were later excised and the histopathological examination showed the presence of neural nevus involving the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. This case is being reported for its rarity, the higher risk for melanoma transformation, its association with meningeal melanosis and few benign / malignant tumors...|$|R
5000|$|The {{book about}} Chernyshevski {{finds itself in}} a “good, thundery {{atmosphere}} of scandal which helped sales”. Most reviews in the literary world of the émigrés are critical as the book debunks its subject {{as a writer and}} thinker, Koncheyev ’s review, however, is quite positive. Fyodor is unable to show the book to Alexander Yakovlevich Chernyshevski who had recently died. His death and funeral are described. On his way home, Fyodor walks with the writer Shirin, “a deaf and blind man with blocked nostrils”. Shirin tries to engage Fyodor in the activities of the Committee of the Society of Russian Writers in Germany. Fyodor declines but attends some meetings observing the infighting for control of the society. Shchyogolev is offered a job in Copenhagen, and plans to leave Zina in the Berlin apartment. Fyodor is elated and takes a walk in the Grunewald forest, where he imagines to have a talk with Koncheyev. His clothes including the key to the apartment get stolen, and he has to return in his <b>bathing</b> <b>trunks.</b> At night he dreams that his father has come back. Next morning the Shchyogolevs leave for Copenhagen, and Zina stays behind. Fyodor who is planning to write a [...] "classical novel" [...] (The Gift) and Zina can now live together. They are without money, both at the moment have lost the key to their apartment, but they are happy, they feel that fate brought them together, and Zina declares that he will be “a writer as has never been before“.|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{descriptions}} {{for white}} sharks listed in Table 1 of doi: 10. 1155 / 2013 / 598745 19260603 : On 3 June 1926 a 3. 8 m white shark was caught just offshore of Kahuku, O‘ahu. The shark had been hooked by its tail {{to a long}} line set for ulua (Caranx ignobilis) the night before, and was so exhausted that it was easily landed. Upon being cut open, the stomach was observed to contain “the skull and bones of both arms, one hand and one leg besides a quantity of black hair about three inches in length…together {{with a pair of}} <b>bathing</b> <b>trunks.</b> ” [1]. The trunks appeared to be Army issue, and the remains were identified the following day as belonging to an Army private who had drowned at Haleiwa on May 18. The shortest distance from Haleiwa to Kahuku along the coast is approximately 25 km. Newspaper accounts did not indicate the sex of the shark, and only one account [2] identified the shark as a white shark. 19591207 : In response to a December 13, 1958 fatal attack on Billy Weaver off Lanikai, O‘ahu the State of Hawaii conducted the Billy Weaver Shark Research and Control Program, which operated from 1959 - 1960 [3, 4]. Two white sharks were caught off Windward O‘ahu during the program. The first was a 3. 5 m male caught 7 December 1959 on a line set at depth 44 - 47 m off Kahuku to Waiale‘e. 19600306 : The second white shark caught during the Billy Weaver program was a 10 ft 10 in (3. 3 m) female. It was caught 6 March 1960 on a line set at depth 23 - 30 f (42 - 55 m) off Mokoli‘i (Chinaman’s Hat) to Pyramid Rock [3]. 19610308 : A 4. 1 m white shark was captured by a commercial fisherman off Honolulu and brought back to the Honolulu Marineland at Kewalo basin, where it lived for two days [5, 6]. Unfortunately, records do not include the sex of the shark, nor what happened to the carcass following the its death...|$|E
