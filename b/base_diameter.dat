A column height to diameter of 6:1 became more usual, while the column height to entablature ratio at the Parthenon is about 3:1. During the Hellenistic period, Doric conventions of solidity and masculinity dropped away, with the slender and unfluted columns reaching a height to diameter ratio of 7.5:1.|$|E

25|$|The 1896 {{lighthouse}} is a timber-framed structure clad in corrugated iron, standing twelve metres {{high and}} capped with a domed lantern. The tower is conical in form with a <b>base</b> <b>diameter</b> of approximately 4.3 metres reducing to a top diameter of 2.26 metres. It has been reinstalled at its original location on a round concrete slab {{placed over the}} top of the original 1896 footing when it was returned from Golden Beach in 1999. Corrugations in the iron sheeting taper inwards for the full height of the tower. Most exterior sheeting is early, slip-sheeted in places with zinc sheeting to repair rusted sections. A small timber-framed entry projects from the northern side, clad in corrugated iron with an arched corrugated iron roof. The door is made from tongue and groove boards on a timber frame. Four small, rectangular windows provide daylight to the interior – two at ground level and two corresponding to the level of the central interior platform. They are vertical sliders, framed with cedar and weather-proofed on the exterior by lead flashing. The exterior of the tower is painted white, with the exception of a red border on the entry door.|$|E
