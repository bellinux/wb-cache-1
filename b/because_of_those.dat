5|$|The Battle of Brunanburh is an Old English poem. It is {{preserved}} in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a historical record of events in Anglo-Saxon England which was kept from the late ninth to the mid-twelfth century. The poem records the Battle of Brunanburh, a battle fought in 937 between an English army and a combined army of Scots, Vikings, and Britons. The battle resulted in an English victory, celebrated by the poem in style and language like that of traditional Old English battle poetry. The poem is notable <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> traditional elements and has been praised for its authentic tone, {{but it is also}} remarkable for its fiercely nationalistic tone, which documents the development of a unified England ruled by the House of Wessex.|$|E
25|$|In system {{programming}}, often limited programming {{facilities are}} available. The use of automatic garbage collection is not common and debugging is {{sometimes hard to}} do. The runtime library, if available at all, is usually far less powerful, and does less error checking. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> limitations, monitoring and logging are often used; operating systems may have extremely elaborate logging subsystems.|$|E
25|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses instructed that the Israelites were not to imitate the abhorrent practices of the nations that they were displacing, consign their children to fire, or act as an augur, soothsayer, diviner, sorcerer, one who casts spells, one who consults ghosts or familiar spirits, or one who inquires of the dead, for it was <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> abhorrent acts that God was dispossessing the residents of the land. The fourth reading ends here.|$|E

Steelcase manufactured the furniture for the Johnson Wax Building in Racine, Wisconsin, which was also designed by Wright and is recognized as a landmark building. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> ties, Steelcase purchased and restored the property in the 1980s. The restoration has been heralded {{as one of the most}} accurate and complete of any Wright restoration. The home is used by Steelcase for special events and is open to the public for tours.|$|E
25|$|Paul campaigned {{heavily in}} Nevada, more than Mitt Romney, {{the only other}} {{candidate}} to go there. On January 17, Paul's Nevada campaign representatives warned state GOP officials that thousands of caucus-goers had been given wrong caucus locations. A correction was put onto the Nevada GOP website that morning, {{two days before the}} caucuses. Then Paul's campaign criticized inconsistencies, confusion over rules, and a shortage of ballots in some counties. They asked the state Republican Party to consider postponing the vote <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> problems and others, such as unclear rules on who could vote.|$|E
25|$|Nadal {{played only}} three tournaments the {{remainder}} of the year. Joachim Johansson, ranked world No. 690, upset Nadal {{in the second round of}} the Stockholm Open. The following week, Nadal lost to Tomáš Berdych in the quarterfinals of the year's last Masters Series tournament, the Mutua Madrileña Masters in Madrid. During the round-robin stage of the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup, Nadal lost to James Blake but defeated Nikolay Davydenko and Robredo. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> two victories, Nadal qualified for the semifinals, where he lost to Federer. This was Nadal's third loss in nine career matches with Federer.|$|E

25|$|Istanbul inaugurated horse trams in 1872 {{and these}} served {{the people of}} Istanbul until 1912. Following this date, {{electric}} trams {{were put in place}} and they were the main means for urban public transport until 1966. Many routes were built step by step, and it reached their most widespread network in 1956 with 108 million passengers in 270 shuttles in 56 lines. Tramcars were not modernized for many decades, and some of the 1911 electric cars were still running in the 1960s. At that time modern buses provided faster and smoother journeys. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> negative issues, tram system closed in mid-1960s.|$|E
25|$|Migrant deaths {{along the}} Mexico–U.S. border occur {{hundreds}} of times a year <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> attempting to cross into the United States from Mexico illegally. The US Border Patrol reported 322 migrant deaths in fiscal year 2016 (ending 30 September 2016), which was higher than the numbers reported in 2014 and 2015 (313 and 251, respectively), but lower {{than the number of}} deaths reported in any year during the period 2003-2013. The highest number of deaths reported over the period 1998-2016 were the 492 deaths reported by the Border Patrol in 2005. Exposure (including heat stroke, dehydration, and hyperthermia) were the leading cause.|$|E
25|$|Spain's final area {{of inquiry}} was the Nelson area, {{including}} the Wairau Valley. The hearings {{had been scheduled}} to begin in June 1843 but were delayed by the violent clash in the Wairau Valley on 17 June in which 26 lives were lost. FitzRoy, who arrived in New Zealand about two months later, conducted his own inquiry into the affray and ruled that the Europeans were at fault for pressing ahead with efforts to survey the land rather than wait for Spain's investigation and adjudication. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> events, Spain's inquiry at Nelson did not begin until 19 August 1844. By then Wakefield had adopted a more conciliatory approach and had decided to pay Maori compensation where Spain decided it was necessary—in Port Nicholson, Wanganui and Manawatu—and also decided to abandon claim to any land in the Wairau Valley.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to republics operating under either the presidential system or the semi-presidential system, {{the head of}} state usually does not have executive powers as an executive president would, <b>because</b> many <b>of</b> <b>those</b> powers have been granted to a head of government (usually called a prime minister).|$|R

25|$|Since {{the late}} 20th {{century and the}} {{establishment}} of Galicia's autonomy, the Galician language is resurgent. In the cities, it is generally used as a second language for most. According to a 2001 census, 99.16 {{percent of the population of}} Galicia understood the language, 91.04 percent spoke it, 68.65 percent could read it and 57.64 percent could write it. The first two numbers (understanding and speaking) were roughly the same as responses a decade earlier. But there were great gains among the percentage of the population who could read and write Galician: a decade earlier, only 49.3 percent of the population could read Galician, and 34.85 percent could write it. During the Franco era, the teaching of Galician was prohibited. Today older people may speak the language but have no written competence <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> years. Among the regional languages of Spain, Galician has the highest percentage of speakers in its population.|$|E

By the late 1950s, Mansfield began to generate {{a great deal of}} negative publicity because of repeated exposure of her breasts in carefully staged public [...] "accidents". Richard Blackwell, her wardrobe designer (who also designed for Jane Russell, Dorothy Lamour, Peggy Lee and Nancy Reagan), dropped her from his client list <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> accidents.
