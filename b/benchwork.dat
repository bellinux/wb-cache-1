50|$|The {{cheap and}} simple water {{aspirator}} {{is the most}} common type of aspirator. It is used in chemistry and biology laboratories and consists of a tee fitting attached to a tap and has a hose barb at one side. The flow of water passes through the straight portion of the tee, which has a restriction at the intersection, where the hose barb is attached. The vacuum hose should be connected to this barb. While previously common for low-strength vacuums needed in chemistry <b>benchwork,</b> they use a lot of water, and depending on what the vacuum is being used for, i.e. solvent removal, they can violate environmental protection laws such as RCRA by mixing these potentially hazardous solvents into the water stream, then flushing them down a drain that often leads directly to the municipal sewer.|$|E
50|$|For {{several decades}} now, hacksaw blades have used {{high speed steel}} for their teeth, giving greatly {{improved}} cutting and tooth life. These blades were first available in the 'All-hard' form which cut accurately but were extremely brittle. This limited their practical use to <b>benchwork</b> on a workpiece that was firmly clamped in a vice. A softer form of high speed steel blade was also available, which wore well and resisted breakage, but was less stiff and so less accurate for precise sawing. Since the 1980s, bi-metal blades {{have been used to}} give the advantages of both forms, without risk of breakage. A strip of high speed steel along the tooth edge is electron beam welded to a softer spine. As the price of these has dropped to be comparable with the older blades, their use is now almost universal.|$|E

The final version is available from Wiley via [URL] practical classes are a common feature of life science teaching, during which students learn how to perform experiments and generate/interpret data. Practical classes are typically instructional, concentrating on providing topic- and technique-specific skills, however to produce research-capable graduates {{it is also important}} to develop generic practical skills. To provide an opportunity for students to develop the skills needed to create bespoke protocols for experimental <b>benchwork,</b> a traditional practical was repurposed. Students were given a list of available resources and an experimental goal, and directed to create a bench protocol to achieve the aim (measuring the iron in hemoglobin). In a series of teaching events students received feedback from staff, and peers prototyped the protocols, before protocols were finally implemented. Graduates highlighted this exercise as one of the most important of their degrees, primarily because of the clear relevance of the skills acquired to professional practice. The exercise exemplifies a range of pedagogic principles, but arguably its most important innovation is that it repurposed a pre-existing practical. This had the benefits of automatically providing scaffolding to direct the students' thought processes, while retaining the advantages of a ?discovery learning? exercise, and allowing facile adoption of the approach across the sector. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|I am an {{academic}} scientist {{who has worked}} for nine years on issues related to endocrine disruptors, including assessments of human exposures, meta-analyses of published literature, and <b>benchwork</b> assessing the effects of chemicals on development, behavior, reproduction, and other endpoints in rodents and aquatic animals. My PhD is in Cell, Molecular and Developmental Biology, although my work is also well recognized in the field of Environmental Health Science. I have published more than 25 peer-reviewed studies and two book chapters and have served on expert scientific and risk assessment panels in the EU and the US. I was also the lead author on the most comprehensive review to date on low dose exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs; discussed in more detail below). I am writing to challenge the assertion that âmonitoring of individual CECs is not [necessary] for recycled water used for landscape irrigation. â I encourage you to consider the extensive peerreviewed scientific literature on the effects of low doses of EDCs before making decisions about chemical safety in the water supply. Although your scientific board, and many toxicologists around the world, conclude that âthe dose makes the poison â when it comes to environmental toxicants, this statement is simply not supported by fact when the chemical in question is a hormone, hormone mimic, or hormone blocker. In 2001 - 2002, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) addressed whether there was sufficient evidence to conclude that EDCs act at low doses, i. e. at the doses that humans encounter in their everyday lives. As you are likely well aware, humans encounter EDCs in their food, water, air, dust, as well as household products like detergents, upholstery, solvents, etc. Although typical humans are exposed to low levels of these chemicals (often in the nanogram per kilogram body weight range), the US FDA has identified more than 1000 EDCs in current use, a significant percentage of the over 80, 000 chemicals currently in commerce (se...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{has been}} developed for the nontechnical gas industry manager who has {{the responsibility for the}} development of waste or potentially contaminated soil and groundwater data or must make decisions based on such data for the management or remediation of these materials. It explores the pse of common analytical chemistry instrumentation and associated techniques for identification of environmentally hazardous materials. Sufficient detail is given to familiarize the nontechnical reader with the principles behind the operation of each technique. The scope and realm of the techniques and their constituent variations are portrayed through a discussion of crucial details and, where appropriate, the depiction of real-life data. It is the author's intention to provide an easily understood handbook for gas industry management. Techniques which determine the presence, composition, and quantification of gas industry wastes are discussed. Greater focus is given to traditional techniques which have been the mainstay of modem analytical <b>benchwork.</b> However, with the continual advancement of instrumental principles and design, several techniques have been included which are likely to receive greater attention in fiture considerations for waste-related detection. Definitions and concepts inherent to a thorough understanding of the principles common to analytical chemistry are discussed. It is also crucial that gas industry managers understand the effects of the various actions which take place before, during, and after the actual sampling step. When a series of sample collection, storage, and transport activities occur, new or inexperienced project managers may overlook or misunderstand the importance of the sequence. Each step has an impact on the final results of the measurement process; errors in judgment or decision making can be costly. Specific techniques and methodologies for the collection, storage, and transport of environmental media samples are not described or discussed in detail in thk handbook. However, the underlying philosophy regarding the importance of proper collection, storage, and transport practices, as well as pertinent references, are presented...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, cell therapy {{has emerged as}} a {{potential}} new treatment of a variety of cardiac diseases, including acute myocardial infarction, refractory angina, and chronic heart failure. A myriad of cell types have been tested experimentally, each of them being usually credited by its advocates of a high âregenerationâ potential. This has led to a flurry of clinical trials entailing the use of skeletal myoblasts or bone marrowâderived cells either unfractionated or enriched in progenitor subpopulations. As often in medicine, the hype generated by the early uncontrolled and small-sized studies has been dampened by the marginally successful outcomes of the subsequent, more rigorously conducted randomized trials. Although they may have failed to achieve their primary end points, these trials have been positive {{in the sense that they}} have allowed to identify some key issues and it is reasonable to speculate that if these issues can now be addressed by appropriately focused <b>benchwork,</b> the outcomes of the second generation of cell-transplantation studies would likely be upgraded. It, thus, appears that not âone cell fits allâ but that the selection of the cell type should be tailored to the primary clinical indication. On the one hand, it does not make sense to develop an âidealâ cell in a culture dish, if we remain unable to deliver it appropriately and to keep it alive, at least for a while, which requires to improve on the delivery techniques and to provide cells along with the vascular and extracellular matrix type of support necessary for their survival and patterning. On the other hand, the persisting mechanistic uncertainties about cell therapy should not preclude continuing clinical trials, which often provide the unique opportunity of identifying issues missed by our suboptimal preclinical models. Finally, regardless of whether cells are expected to act paracrinally or by physically replacing lost cardiomyocytes and, thus, effecting a true myocardial regeneration, safety remains a primary concern. It is, thus, important that clinical development programs be shaped in a way that allows the final cell-therapy product to be manufactured from fully traceable materials, phenotypically well characterized, consistent, scalable, sterile, and genetically stable as these characteristics are those that will be required by the ultimate gatekeeper, i. e., the regulator, and are thus unbypassable prerequisites for an effective and streamlined leap from bench to bedside...|$|E
40|$|Systematics of the {{blackfly}} subgenus Trichodagmia ENDERLEIN (Diptera: Simuliidae: Simulium) in the New World The systematics of the New World subgenus Trichodagmia {{has been}} reassessed by employing an integrated taxonomic approach based upon revisionary taxonomy, phylogenetic (cladistics) analysis, and DNA barcoding. This subgenus included {{several species of}} great medical importance, which are all morphologically very similar. The history of the taxonomy and classification of the subgenus Trichodagmia has been put into context with other subgenera within New World Simuliidae, while descriptions and keys to the identification of species in this subgenus are also given. The subgenus Obuchovia is here considered a new junior synonym of Trichodagmia, and all its constituentsâ species are now placed in the ALBELLUM species group to represent a Palaearctic element within this subgenus. Three new junior synonymies are here proposed: Simulium chiriquiense FIELD is a synonym of S. ethelae DALMAT n. syn.; S. biuxinisa COSCARÃN & IBÃÃEZ-BERNAL is a synonym of S. paynei VARGAS n. syn.; and S. keenani FIELD is a synonym of S. earlei VARGAS, MARTÃNEZ PALÃCIOS &DÃAZ NÃJERA n. syn. A neotype is designated for S. lahillei (PATERSON & SHANNON) and a lectotype for S. pulverulentum KNAB. 1 Simulium falculatum ENDERLEIN is transferred from the TARSATUM species group of to the CANADENSE species group based on the morphology of the female genitalia. Two species, S. rivasi RAMÃREZ PÃREZ and S. oviedoi RAMÃREZ PÃREZ, are transferred from the TARSATUM species group to the subgenus Psilopelmia based on the morphology of the male gonostyle and the ventral plate. Keys to separate all species groups and species based on the adults, pupae and larvae are also provided. The phylogeny and classification of the subgenus Trichodagmia is delineated using a cladistic analysis of 63 taxa based on males, females, pupae and larvae, including two species belonging to the subgenus Aspathia and two species of the subgenus Simulium s. str. that served as outgroups. Analysis of the original full data set [67 taxa and 67 characters] with multistate characters treated as unordered under equal weights led to poorly resolved trees, with many polytomies within TARSATUM [= old subgenus Hemicnetha] and CANADENSE [= old subgenus Hearlea]. Nonetheless, the ALBELLUM [= old subgenus Obuchovia] and PICTIPES [= old subgenus Shewellomyia] species groups, and some clades within the CANADENSE species group were well supported. In the most parsimonious cladograms, the position of S. falculatum was problematic as it was placed basal to Trichodagmia. The position of S. jeteri, albeit within the ORBITALE [= old subgenera Trichodagmia + Thyrsopelma of MIRANDA-ESQUIVEL & COSCARÃN, 2001] clade, was also poorly resolved. This was certainly due to the numerous missing data in these two taxa. Therefore, they {{were removed from the}} data set together with other taxa in which three life stages (> 70 % of characters) were missing (e. g. S. paracarolinae and S. tarsale). A second analysis was then performed with 63 taxa and 67 characters. In this analysis, the Strict Consensus Tree was better resolved and certain clades within the expanded concept of Trichodagmia (sensu SHELLEY et al., 2010) were recovered as monophyletic with high support values. The ALBELLUM species group is monophyletic in a sister-group relationship with the other species groups in Trichodagmia (sensu SHELLEY et al., 2010). The ORBITALE species group clade was recovered as monophyletic by a unique combination of seven characters with 89 % bootstrap support. In this clade, all species close to S. guianense s. l. were better diagnosed by a combination of four characters, one of which (male ventral plate with a globular median process) was unique to this group. The position of S. hirtipupa is better resolved in the latter clade by the presence of black spiniform setae in the frontoclypeus and thorax of the pupa. In contrast, the TARSATUM and CANADENSE species groups were diagnosed by only four and five characters, respectively. Within the CANADENSE species group only species with larvae having sclerotized plates in the posterior region of the abdomen were well resolved. Species in the TARSATUM group were homoplastic. The PICTIPES group is only diagnosed by homoplasies, but the combination of these characters is unique to this clade (polythetic taxon). In general, this study supports some of the taxonomic changes proposed in SHELLEY et al. (2010), in which the subgeneric-names Hearlea, Hemicnetha, Shewellomyia, Trichodagmia + Thyrsopelma (sensu MIRANDA-ESQUIVEL & COSCARÃN, 502 2001) are treated as species groups within the subgenus Trichodagmia. Moreover, this study also supports the proposal of Obuchovia as a junior synonym within the clade Trichodagmia to represent the ALBELLUM species group. The utility of the COI DNA barcoding methodology for identification of species in the subgenus Trichodagmia and related taxa has been tested. In total, 24 morphospecies within the current expanded morphological concept of Trichodagmia were analyzed. In addition, three species of the subgenus Aspathia and 10 species of the subgenus Simulium s. str. were also included in the analysis because of their putative phylogenetic relationship with Trichodagmia. Within the barcoding neighbour-joining tree, most of the specimens were grouped together according to morpho-taxon (species groups and species). Mean genetic distance amongst groups (morphospecies) averaged 11. 2 % (ranged 2. 8 - 19. 5 %), whereas intraspecific genetic divergence within morphologically distinct species averaged 0. 5 % (range 0 - 1. 3 %). In known species complexes, maximum values of genetic divergence (3. 28 - 3. 79 %) indicate the probable presence of cryptic diversity. DNA barcoding achieved nearly 100 % success in identifying all specimens of the subgenus Trichodagmia and related taxa. The existence of well defined groups within S. piperi, S. duodenicornium, S. canadense and S. rostratum highlighted the possible presence of species complexes in these taxa. In addition, the suspected presence of a sibling species in S. paynei and S. tarsatum among populations of Belize, Costa Rica, and the USA is confirmed. The use of shorter barcodes (midi and minibarcodes) from specimens held in collections was problematic with regards to the DNA quality and PCR success. However, in the cases that a readable sequence was obtained, they were sufficient for reliable species identification. With regards to the different extraction and preservation techniques tested, larvae preserved in diluted Carnoyâs (10 % acetic acid) provided full DNA barcodes. Furthermore, legs added directly to the PCR mix from freshly collected individuals provided full length barcodes sequences. However, specimens of more than 10 years old did not yield good PCR products. In short, I conclude that DNA barcoding in combination with a morphological <b>benchwork</b> platform is an effective approach for identification and delineation of species in the subgenus Trichodagmia, and the discovery of hidden diversity in this taxon.
