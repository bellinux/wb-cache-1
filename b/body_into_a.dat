25|$|T. domestica {{is not a}} {{particularly}} aggressive species and will often retreat when confronted. As long as its web is undisturbed, the spider will usually retreat to the funnel tip and stop responding to any movement whatsoever. If the web is attacked and partially destroyed, the spider will attempt to flee the area or may huddle its <b>body</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> ball against the wall or some other nearby object. To usher the spider into a container for removal, place open end {{in front of the}} spider and use the container lid if so equipped or similar object to push or corral the spider from behind. Since a spider's first reflex after being disturbed from the rear is to move forward, usually the spider will advance into the container placed in front of it.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Godwin {{was living}} in Palm Springs, California, working as a {{self-employed}} tool salesman, a mechanic, and a construction worker, with no discernible criminal history.

Godwin and Soto lured LeValley back to their condominium where Soto held him, Godwin punched and kicked him, tried to strangle him, then ultimately stabbed LeValley 26 times with his butcher knife., however, during the trial, the prosecution said that Godwin used a serrated edge knife. A butcher's knife was not mentioned. After the murder, Godwin and Soto loaded the <b>body</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> truck and set off for the desert. Godwin tried {{to blow up the}} evidence by using homemade explosives strapped to the body. The explosion was intended to disguise the murder of LeValley.

Suspecting that Ray had a new lover, when Hackman saw her in the theatre with William Hanger, 3rd Baron Coleraine, he left, fetched two pistols, and waited in a nearby coffee house. After Ray and Galli came out of the theatre, Hackman approached the ladies just as they were about to get into their carriage. He put one pistol to Ray's forehead and shot her dead. With the other he then tried to kill himself but made only a flesh wound. He then beat himself with both discharged pistols until he was arrested and taken, with Martha Ray's <b>body,</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tavern in St James's Street. Two letters were found on Hackman, one addressed to his brother-in-law, Frederick Booth, and a love letter to Martha Ray: both later appeared in evidence at the murder trial.|$|E
