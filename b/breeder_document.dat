5000|$|In a 2003 {{letter to}} the Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge by the U.S. House Chairmen of the Homeland Security Committee, the Judiciary Committee, the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, and the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, & Intellectual Property, it was written that the Matricula Consular [...] "can be a perfect <b>breeder</b> <b>document</b> for {{establishing}} a false identity". They warned that criminals could exploit the cards to conceal their identity as well as launder money and write fraudulent checks. They went on {{to point out that}} any acceptance of the cards by the Federal government [...] "compromises our homeland security" [...] by providing an opportunity for terrorists to freely move about the U.S., board planes and transfer funds for terrorist activities.|$|E
40|$|Situation and Challenges Family Book as an Important <b>Breeder</b> <b>Document</b> Slide 2 Situation and Challenges • Increasing risk of {{fraudsters}} attacking breeder documents • In Arabic {{countries the}} family book {{is an important}} <b>breeder</b> <b>document</b> {{and needs to be}} protected • Often family books have only limited security features • However the family book is one proof of identification and often a prerequisite to other official documents such as national ID cards, passports etc...|$|E
5000|$|Reliance on “breeder documents” (documents {{designed}} to verify other documents) to verify identities is flawed, {{as there is}} no standardized means to verify that information contained in <b>breeder</b> <b>documents</b> is legitimate. Identity scoring {{can be used as a}} tool to authenticate identities on an independent level in cases of employment hiring and information verification.|$|R
50|$|In {{the process}} of {{granting}} visa-free travel to the Schengen Area, the European Union urged Serbia to found such a special authority for its citizens residing in Kosovo as the European Union considered it impossible for Serbia to evaluate the issuing of <b>breeder</b> <b>documents</b> needed {{to apply for a}} passport and the integrity of the procedures applied by Serbia to check the authentity of documents provided by applicants for that purpose. In July 2009, Serbia founded the Serbian Coordination Directorate.|$|R
50|$|The Kennel Club Uruguayo (Uruguayan {{national}} kennel club) recognised the Cimarrón Uruguayo {{after some}} {{twenty years of}} work by fanciers and <b>breeders</b> in <b>documenting</b> the breed. In addition, genetic studies are being done on the breed by the Universidad de la Republica Oriental del Uruguay college of Veterinary Medicine.|$|R
40|$|Automated {{border control}} gates {{are now being}} more and more {{deployed}} at airports to smooth border crossings with reduced man power and more convenience to the passenger. In order to use these new gates the traveler is required to present an electronic passport (e-Passport or biometric passport). Lots of efforts have been undertaken to improve {{the security of the}} infrastructure at borders or by adding various security features to the passport. However, the weakest point in the passport issuance process is the enrolment step for passport applicant including the <b>breeder</b> <b>documents</b> authenticity and the duplicate enrolment check. The goal of duplicate enrolment check is to prevent the issuance of duplicate illegal passports containing possibly fake identities. A solution to this problem needs to be flexible and precise if the solution is meant for large-scale deployments and eventually standardization. This paper describes how a duplicate enrolment check can be realized securely between European Union member states using distributed databases of alphanumeric data and multiple biometric modalities...|$|R
25|$|People born in Kosovo or {{otherwise}} legally settled in Kosovo are by law considered Serbian nationals {{and as such}} {{they are entitled to}} a Serbian passport. However, these passports are not issued by the Serbian Ministry of the Interior. Instead they are issued by the Serbian Coordination Directorate. These particular passports do not allow the holder to enter the Schengen Area without a visa for a stay of less than three months within half a year, while Serbian citizens with passports issued by the Serbian Ministry of the Interior enjoy such a privilege. Bearers of passports issued by the Serbian Coordination Directorate require Schengen visa for travel to Schengen area since they are not covered by the Annex II list of countries allowed visa free entry to the Schengen Area. The European Union considered it impossible for Serbia to evaluate the issuing of <b>breeder</b> <b>documents</b> needed to apply for a passport and the integrity of the procedures applied by Serbia to check the authenticity of documents provided by applicants for that purpose.|$|R
50|$|The Ryukyu Ken, {{like all}} Japanese dog breeds, are {{considered}} to be relatively healthy dogs overall with not many health issues. The health conditions for Ryukyu Ken aren't well <b>documented.</b> <b>Breeders</b> of Ryukyu Ken are urged to test for hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, glaucoma, Collie eye anomaly (CEA) and hypothyroidism.|$|R
50|$|They are {{communal}} <b>breeders,</b> with <b>documented</b> {{feeding of}} young by numerous birds, probably as an adaptation to an erratic climate in arid and semi-arid conditions.They also exhibit {{a tendency to}} flock and cluster roost, {{during the day and}} night. Clustering assists with thermoregulation,wind protection,social drive and reduces predation risk. Breeding generally follows periods of rain with abundant insects, generally, they breed once a year between August and September.The sexes look alike, and courtship displays consist of rotating tails and wing waving.The male and female perch a metre apart, then spread their wings while fanning and rotating the tail.The white colouration of the wing tips becomes more conspicuous during the courtship display.|$|R
50|$|Constituent {{countries}} of the World Trade Organization are required to acknowledge {{the creation of new}} varieties of plants, and to uphold these creations within full recognition of intellectual property rights laws. A formalized legislature, exemplifying the manner in which such intellectual property rights can be conferred, is demonstrated by the 1991 UPOV convention, which declares such rights upon an individual <b>breeder.</b> This <b>document</b> further identifies a breeder as one who has found or created a plant variety, one who possesses legal authority for the contractual production of a new plant variety, or one who has inherited legal rights to this form of  intellectual property as it was derived under either of the two aforementioned conditions.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of new varieties required exact depiction of the fruit so that plant <b>breeders</b> could accurately <b>document</b> and disseminate their research results. Since the use of scientific photography was not widespread in the late 19th Century, USDA commissioned artists to create watercolor illustrations of newly introduced cultivars. Many of the watercolors were used for lithographic reproductions in USDA publications, such as the Report of the Pomologist and the Yearbook of Agriculture.|$|R
50|$|Elmer Swenson {{worked on}} a 120 acre farm near Osceola, Wisconsin which he had {{inherited}} from his maternal grandfather Larson, an immigrant from Sweden. Swenson began breeding grapes in 1943, starting a program of intercrossing French hybrid grapes with selections of the local wild species, Vitis riparia. He {{was inspired by the}} work of T.V. Munson, a Texas <b>breeder</b> who had <b>documented</b> the American grape species and heavily utilized them in his breeding. Swenson hoped to generate seedlings capable of producing high quality fruit in his climate, something few if any cultivars could do reliably at that time.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Seedling root {{fluorescence}} (SRF) {{has been}} used as a test in the USA since 1941 to discriminate Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) from perennial ryegrass (L. perenne L.). Generally, roots of Italian ryegrass fluorescece when exposed to ultraviolet light, while roots of perennial ryegrass do not. Presence of fluorescent seedlings in lots of perennial ryegrass can cause concern among buyers who fear contamination of Italian ryegrass. The SRF trait has introgressed between the two species of ryegrass, and since 1991 <b>breeders</b> have <b>documented</b> inherent varietal fluorescence levels (VFL) of ryegrass cultivars before multiplication of seed under seed certification programs. Studies were conducted to further elucidate plant growing condition aspects of SRF in ryegrass. Four populations with different fluorescence levels were assembled from among ryegrass half-sib families. The four populations were increased independently for three generations at each of three Oregon locations. There was considerable variation for SRF among locations within populations, and for generations within location. Generally, each population increased in SRF each generation of multiplication at Corvallis, but did not increase at the Aurora and Madras sites. Significant location X population and location X generation interactions indicated a strong location effect on SRF. Heritabilities of SRF were estimated using realized response from 26 half-sib families at the three locations. Heritability estimates ranged from 97 to 99...|$|R
