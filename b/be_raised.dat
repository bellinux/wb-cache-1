5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Treasury's {{withdrawal}} of funding, in May 1898 the churchwardens of St Botolph's Aldersgate brokered a compromise with the CPF. The disputed site was split into two parts, each priced at £6,000. The western section would be purchased immediately using £6,000 of the £7,000 already raised, with an option to purchase the eastern section if the remaining £5,000 could <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> within two years, after which the CPF would go ahead with building plans if the money could not <b>be</b> <b>raised.</b>|$|E

5|$|The act {{authorised}} {{an initial}} £75,000 to <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> {{to pay for}} construction, together with an option to raise a further £30,000, of which £20,000 should <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> by shares of £100 each among the initial subscribers, and £10,000 by mortgaging the future income of the canal. However, this amount proved insufficient, {{and there was also}} disagreement between the shareholders as to their liability to raise the additional £20,000. As a result, a second act was sought. This received the Royal Assent on 3 March 1797, and made clear the obligations of existing shareholders to pay the extra subscription, and also authorised an additional £24,000 to <b>be</b> <b>raised.</b> The second act also removed restrictions in the first act, and allowed the company to set whatever rates it chose for using the canal.|$|E

5|$|The {{case was}} argued before Judge (and later President) William Howard Taft, who {{held that the}} federal court could not prevent the removal of {{officers}} by injunction. He advised the Republicans to seek remedy quo warranto in the state courts. Taft further opined that, should any federal question <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> in such proceedings, the officers could seek remedy in a federal court on appeal. The Republicans were encouraged by Taft's decision, which {{cleared the way for}} an appeal {{all the way to the}} federal Supreme Court if a federal question could <b>be</b> <b>raised.</b>|$|E

5|$|The wooden Pontnewydd aqueduct, {{which was}} prone to the river flowing over its top, was {{replaced}} by an iron one built on a slightly higher level to provide more room for the river to flow under it. Pinkerton's two locks were rebuilt, and {{the banks of the}} Kymer canal were raised by , to allow the water level to <b>be</b> <b>raised.</b> This had also required the Kidwelly basin walls to <b>be</b> <b>raised.</b> At the southern end, access to Burry Port harbour required a deep cutting to be constructed, and this was completed by March 1835.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the war, the government's immediate response was to announce on 5 September 1939 that it would begin calling up 10,000 militiamen at a time to provide sixteen days continuous service manning guard posts at selected points around the country. This was later expanded on 15 September to include all of the Militia, in two drafts of 40,000 men, for one month's continuous training, however, the suspension on compulsory training introduced in 1929 was not amended until January 1940. On 5 September 1939 it was also announced that a division would <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> for overseas service, but there was still large-scale opposition to the concept of conscription and the provisions of the Defence Act still precluded conscripts from serving outside of Australian territory, so it was announced that this force would <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> from volunteers only and would not <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> directly from the Militia. Conscripts, however, were required to serve in the Militia, with the result being that the Militia's ranks were filled with both volunteers and conscripts during this time.|$|E
