25|$|The years 1813–1815 were {{difficult}} and tragic ones for Stock. Dresden was in chaos from the terminal {{stages of the}} Napoleonic wars, with the homes (the Körner home included) taken over by French soldiers and great numbers of civilian deaths. Stock's nephew Theodor, who had volunteered for the Freikorps to fight against Napoleon, died in action (1813); and niece Emma died of a short illness two years later, leaving the Körners childless. Stock, who had <b>been</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> second mother to her sister's children, was as devastated as Minna and Gottfried were.

She also supported Hagen in the 2001 internal conflict, and stated the same year that Hagen had <b>been</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> father figure for her. She became first deputy chairman of the Progress Party in 1998, and parliamentary leader of the party in 2005. In 2006, Carl I. Hagen, chairman of the party since 1978 resigned to become vice president of parliament, and Jensen assumed leadership of the Progress Party to no internal opposition. While many had been speculating about the viability of the party and its future after Hagen resigning, a 2004 survey showed that Jensen enjoyed better general support than him, which was explained by her not being as controversial. Many had also predicted a more moderate course for the party with her being the leader, but she stood firmly by the policies of the party. Her leadership-style has however been considered to be softer than that of Hagen.|$|E

Carson, who had played for five different clubs since making his debut for Leeds in 2004, explained that he wanted to get settled at one club, saying [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> nomad for three or four years. It'll be good to get some roots and hopefully settle. I can see myself here for four or five years, even longer." [...] He made his debut in a 1–0 defeat to Arsenal in the opening match of the 2008–09 Premier League season. Despite relegation to the Championship Carson kept his first team place and after the departure of captain Jonathan Greening he was given the captaincy. West Bromwich Albion won promotion back to the Premier League, finishing second, 12 points clear of third place Nottingham Forest with Carson keeping 15 clean sheets out of 43 matches. He had been playing regular football for the Midlands club, but in the 2010–11 season, his form seemed to dip and in January 2011, Carson was briefly dropped to the bench for Welsh goalkeeper Boaz Myhill. After the appointment of Roy Hodgson as West Bromwich Albion head coach, he swiftly found himself back in favour at The Hawthorns.|$|E

2500|$|Although he {{embarked}} on the Test leg of England's tour of Bangladesh in March 2010, Onions returned {{home with a}} back injury without playing a match. Alastair Cook, England captain on the tour, voiced his disappointment that Onions {{would not be able}} to play for England: [...] "He was a huge part of our plans and he still is, obviously, because of the way he bowled in South Africa, where he was unlucky not to take more wickets than he did. He bowled really well there, and I was expecting him come to these conditions and bowl well here as well." [...] The injury prevented Onions from playing most of the English cricket season. He also underwent surgery on his left knee to repair cartilage. Speaking of his disappointment at not being able to play for England, Onions said [...] "The last few months have been massively frustrating. When you've had a place in the team for a while and you lose it it's hugely disappointing and hurts a lot. Before the injury everything had <b>been</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dream for me, all I ever wanted to do was play for England, but the last six months have been tough." [...] In April 2010 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack named him as one of its five cricketers of the year for 2009. Onions did not recover in time to play in the 2010–11 Ashes series.

People change, priorities change, personal situations change and he's been flying in from Tennessee for all the shows so you can imagine with the recent developments in the US/gas prices/travel and the fact that we were working remotely on the new record had probably something to do with it.

[...] At the same show, Bart's right knee, which had both ligaments torn away in a sports injury, gave in completely and he supported his entire weight on his left knee for the rest of the show. However, this was to no avail as eventually Rob [...] "The Witch" [...] from Necronomicon and Stephane from BCI had to carry Bart around for the rest of the set, eventually having him sit up on a chair for the remainder of the show. Stéphane proposed cutting the show short but Bart refused and played on till the end. In the following months, both his knees had to have surgery.|$|E
