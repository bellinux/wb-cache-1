These are used for applications where extreme mechanical positioning accuracy and high cycling capability are needed. The micro speed unit combines a “main” conical rotor <b>brake</b> <b>motor</b> for rapid speed and a “micro” conical rotor <b>brake</b> <b>motor</b> for slow or positioning speed. The intermediate gearbox allows a range of ratios, and motors of different speeds can be combined to produce high ratios between high and low speed.|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} {{originally}} founded on 1 November 1919 as Pelger in Rotterdam in the Netherlands by Mr. Willem D. Pelger, with a funding capital of 40 Dutch guilders The company {{started at the}} Zwanesteeg 4 in Rotterdam as a direct current electric motor repair shop. In 1920 the first employee was offered a job. Direct current motors were in use in Rotterdam, {{as a result of}} the direct current power supply instead of alternating current supply in these early days of electric grid. In March 1926 the company moved to the Paardenstraat 5 and in May 1929 they moved on to the Van Speykstraat 86-102 in Rotterdam. In 1936 a centrifugal fan, <b>brake</b> <b>motors</b> and small induction motors program from another manufacturer named HSM (short for: Heinke-Schuitema-Musselkanaal) in Musselkanaal was bought and brought to Rotterdam. Mr. K.W. Heinke, one of the former owners and mechanical engineer of HSM also moved to work at the factory in Rotterdam. In the same year 40 off. patents were applied for, with reference to three inventions: the centrifugal switch, the centrifugal fan housing and the principle of a squirrel-cage rotor. The Pelger repair shop gradually evolved into a factory designing and manufacturing special electric motors and centrifugal fans. After some time the two original company names Pelger and HSM were changed into a variant of the existing names: Holland Special Machines Pelger or HSM-Pelger.|$|E

50|$|A conical rotor <b>brake</b> <b>motor</b> {{incorporates}} the <b>brake</b> {{as an integral}} part of the conical sliding rotor. When the motor is at rest, a spring acts on the sliding rotor and forces the brake ring against the brake cap in the motor, holding the rotor stationary. When the motor is energized, its magnetic field generates both an axial and a radial component. The axial component overcomes the spring force, releasing the brake; while the radial component causes the rotor to turn. There is no additional brake control required.|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{friction}} <b>braking</b> {{torque and}} <b>motor</b> <b>braking</b> torque {{can be used}} in braking for electric vehicles (EVs). A sliding mode controller (SMC) based on the exponential reaching law for the anti-lock braking system (ABS) is developed to maintain the optimal slip value. Parameter optimizing is applied to the reaching law by fuzzy logic control (FLC). A regenerative braking algorithm, in which the motor torque is taken full advantage of, is adopted to distribute the braking force between the <b>motor</b> <b>braking</b> and the hydraulic braking. Simulations were carried out with Matlab/Simulink. By comparing with a conventional Bang-bang ABS controller, braking stability and passenger comfort is improved with the proposed SMC controller, and the chatting phenomenon is reduced effectively with the parameter optimizing by FLC. With the increasing proportion of the <b>motor</b> <b>braking</b> torque, the tracking of the slip ratio is more rapid and accurate. Furthermore, the braking distance is shortened and the conversion energy is enhanced...|$|R

50|$|Vacuum {{may be used}} to power, {{or provide}} {{assistance}} to mechanical devices. In hybrid and diesel engine motor vehicles, a pump fitted on the engine (usually on the camshaft) is used to produce vacuum. In petrol engines, instead, vacuum is typically obtained as a side-effect of the operation of the engine and the flow restriction created by the throttle plate, but may be also supplemented by an electrically operated vacuum pump to boost braking assistance or improve fuel consumption. This vacuum may then be used to power the following motor vehicle components: vacuum servo booster for the hydraulic <b>brakes,</b> <b>motors</b> that move dampers in the ventilation system, throttle driver in the cruise control servomechanism, door locks or trunk releases.|$|R
5000|$|Sliding {{may occur}} between two objects of {{arbitrary}} shape, whereas rolling friction is the frictional force {{associated with the}} rotational movement of a somewhat disclike or other circular object along a surface. Generally the frictional force of rolling friction is less than that associated with sliding kinetic friction. [...] Typical values for the coefficient of rolling friction are {{less than that of}} sliding friction. [...] Correspondingly sliding friction typically produces greater sound and thermal bi-products. One of the most common examples of sliding friction is the movement of <b>braking</b> <b>motor</b> vehicle tires on a roadway, a process which generates considerable heat and sound, and is typically taken into account in assessing the magnitude of roadway noise pollution.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} present several {{throttle}} and brake control systems for automatic vehicle following. These control systems are designed and tested using a validated nonlinear vehicle model {{first and then}} actual vehicles. Each vehicle to be controlled {{is assumed to be}} equipped with sensors that, in addition to its own vehicle characteristics, provide measurements of the relative distance and relative speed between itself and the vehicle in front. Vehicle-to- vehicle communication required for the stability of the dynamics of a platoon of vehicles with desired constant intervehicle spacing is avoided. Instead, stability is guaranteed by using a constant time headway policy and designing the control system for the throttle and brake appropriately. The proposed control systems guarantee smooth vehicle following even when the leading vehicle exhibits erratic speed behavior. <b>Motor</b> vehicles [...] <b>Brakes,</b> <b>Motor</b> vehicles [...] Motors, Motor vehicles [...] Automatic control...|$|R

40|$|Barning in {{mind that}} the {{internal}} European market must be protected against unsafe and dangerous products in all fields, including the field of motor vehicles, this paper presents the basic principles of the European standard 286 - 2, which deals with tanks for air <b>braking</b> systems of <b>motor</b> vehicles and their trailers.
