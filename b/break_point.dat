Murray then reached his third semifinal at the French Open, but lost to Djokovic in five sets after threatening a comeback from two sets to love down, ending his 15 match winning streak on clay. To start his grass court campaign, Murray went on to win a record tying fourth Queen's Club title, defeating the big serving South African Kevin Anderson in straight sets in the final. At the third grand slam of the year, the 2015 Wimbledon Championships, Murray dropped only two sets on his way to setting up a semifinal clash with Roger Federer. Murray lost to the Swiss veteran in straight sets, gaining only one <b>break</b> <b>point</b> in the entire match.|$|E

5|$|Federer's season {{turned around}} in the final masters event of the clay season when he {{defeated}} Nadal on clay {{for only the second}} time to capture the Madrid Masters. Federer entered the French Open with few predicting him to win the elusive Parisian title having lost to Nadal in the final weekend for the past four seasons. After Nadal's unexpected defeat to Robin Söderling, Federer suddenly became the overwhelming favorite. It would not be easy as in his next match as he was forced to come from two sets and <b>break</b> <b>point</b> down in the third set to defeat Tommy Haas in five sets. He was also forced to fight back from a two-sets-to-one deficit against a young Juan Martín del Potro to win a five setter in the semifinals. In the final, he faced Söderling, and with a straight sets victory, he finally captured the Coupe des Mousquetaires and career Grand Slam. This victory tied him with Pete Sampras for the most Grand Slam singles titles.|$|E
25|$|A <b>break</b> <b>point</b> occurs if the receiver, not the server, has {{a chance}} to win the game with the next point. Break points are of {{particular}} importance because serving is generally considered advantageous, with servers being expected to win games in which they are serving. A receiver who has one (score of 30–40 or advantage), two (score of 15–40) or three (score of love-40) consecutive chances to win the game has <b>break</b> <b>point,</b> double <b>break</b> <b>point</b> or triple <b>break</b> <b>point,</b> respectively. If the receiver does, in fact, win their <b>break</b> <b>point,</b> the game is awarded to the receiver, and the receiver is said to have converted their <b>break</b> <b>point.</b> If the receiver fails to win their <b>break</b> <b>point</b> it is called a failure to convert. Winning break points, and thus the game, is also referred to as breaking serve, as the receiver has disrupted, or broken the natural advantage of the server. If in the following game the previous server also wins a <b>break</b> <b>point</b> it is referred to as breaking back. Except where tie-breaks apply, at least one break of serve is required to win a set.|$|E

25|$|The first singles {{semifinal}} match saw white group no. 1 Petra Kvitová and red group no. 2 Samantha Stosur. Kvitová was {{the only}} player {{to make it through}} the round robin undefeated, but she showed some cracks in her last match on Friday, falling behind 5–1 in the first set before rallying to beat Agnieszka Radwańska in straights. And although she was up an early break she had somewhat of a slowish start again against a confident Stosur, who came back to take the first set and eventually build a 7–5, 1–0 lead, with a <b>break</b> <b>point</b> to go up 7–5, 2–0. Just like she did before, though, Kvitová came alive when she needed to, winning six of the next eight games to take the second set 6–3, then racing ahead 5–0 in the third. Stosur made things exciting at the end by winning three straight games to close to 5–3, but the Wimbledon champion held on, closing out the US Open champion with a love hold 5–7, 6–3, 6–3. Both Kvitová and Stosur finished with clean winners-to-errors differentials (Kvitová 38–39, Stosur 16–18) but the biggest difference came in creating <b>break</b> <b>point</b> opportunities – Kvitová brought up 11 break points (converting on five) while Stosur only got six break points (converting on three).|$|E

In the second set, Sharapova took several <b>break</b> <b>point</b> opportunities in the second set, before letting Chakvetadze back into the match but eventually she made it through to the semi-finals with a 7–6(5), 7–5 victory.|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the problem of}} detecting <b>break</b> <b>points</b> for a nonstationary time series. Specifically, the time series is assumed to follow a parametric nonlinear time-series model in which the parameters may change values at fixed times. In this formulation, the number and locations of the <b>break</b> <b>points</b> are assumed unknown. The minimum description length (MDL) {{is used as a}} criterion for estimating the number of <b>break</b> <b>points,</b> the locations of <b>break</b> <b>points</b> and the parametric model in each segment. The best segmentation found by minimizing MDL is obtained using a genetic algorithm. The implementation of this approach is illustrated using generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic (GARCH) models, stochastic volatility models and generalized state-space models as the parametric model for the segments. Empirical results show good performance of the {{estimates of the number of}} breaks and their locations for these various models. Copyright 2008 The Authors.

A moment of crisis arrived for Federer with him serving at 8-8 down 15-40, but he rallied to deny Roddick the opportunity to serve for the match. There was not another break opportunity until Roddick served at 14-15 and Federer broke him, for the first time in the entire match, to win a record shattering fifteenth Grand Slam championship. This set remains the longest fifth set in a Grand Slam final. It is the only time in Grand Slam final history where a player has lost despite only having their serve broken once.|$|E

The next week, however, Roddick claimed his second ATP title of the year by winning the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C. for the third time, when he beat American {{newcomer}} John Isner. He then lost in the quarterfinals of the Rogers Cup in Montreal to Novak Djokovic, and in the third round of the Western & Southern Financial Group Masters tournament in Cincinnati to David Ferrer of Spain. At the US Open, Roddick defeated Gimelstob in the first round. He won his next three matches, one in straight sets and the other two when his opponent retired. In the quarterfinals, Roddick once again lost to Federer, bringing his head-to-head record with Federer 1–14. There were no breaks of serve and only one <b>break</b> <b>point</b> total in the first two sets, that being on Federer's serve. Two weeks later, Roddick anchored the U.S. Davis Cup team during its 4–1 semifinal defeat of Sweden. Roddick won both his singles matches, opening the tie with a defeat of Joachim Johansson, and clinching it with a victory over Jonas Björkman. This was the ninth time in nine tries that Roddick had clinched a tie for the American team.|$|E
25|$|Federer's next tournament was the 2012 Swiss Indoors, {{where he}} was seeded first and was a two-time {{defending}} champion. He played Benjamin Becker in the first round, and won in straight sets after overcoming Becker in a tight first set. He then faced Thomaz Bellucci in the second round, and won the first set before dropping a tight second set tiebreak. He then fought off a comeback by Bellucci, and won the match with a break of Bellucci's serve in just over two hours. Federer played Benoît Paire of France in the quarterfinals, and swept past him in straight sets, dropping only one point on serve {{en route to a}} win in less than an hour. In a tougher semifinal, Federer dispatched Paul-Henri Mathieu in straight sets, advancing to his ninth Basel final and equalling John McEnroe's 875 career match wins. Federer played Juan Martín del Potro in the final, and found himself one set down after del Potro broke his serve {{in the middle of the}} first set. Federer fought back in the second set, saving a <b>break</b> <b>point</b> late in the set to force a tiebreak, which he won. However, he was not able to keep his seven-match win streak against del Potro, dropping the match in a third-set tiebreak after failing to convert break points earlier in the set.|$|E
40|$|The {{general purpose}} of the current study was to {{evaluate}} the potency of different categories of reinforcers with young children diagnosed with developmental delays. The participants were two boys and one girl who were between the ages of seven and eight. In Phase 1, we evaluated the reinforcing potency of tokens, edible items, and leisure items by using a progressive ratio (PR) schedule. For two participants, we found that tokens resulted in the highest PR <b>break</b> <b>points.</b> For one participant, edibles resulted in the highest <b>break</b> <b>points</b> (tokens were found to have the lowest <b>break</b> <b>points).</b> In Phase 2, we evaluated the effects of presession access on the <b>break</b> <b>points</b> of edibles and tokens. This manipulation served as a preliminary analysis {{of the extent to which}} tokens might function as generalized conditioned reinforcers. During Phase 2, presession access altered the <b>break</b> <b>points</b> of edibles, but not tokens. The findings of the current study suggest that PR schedules may be useful as a means to better assess certain dimensions of tasks and how they affect reinforcer effectiveness (e. g., amount of effort the client is willing to exert, the duration at which the client willing to work, how many responses the client will emit, etc.), and to evaluate to what extent tokens actually function as generalized conditioned reinforcers...|$|R

Serena made the stronger start, breaking her sister in her first service game, and quickly took a 4–2 lead, as Venus struggled with her return. The momentum of the first set then shifted, when Venus started to play more aggressively, breaking Serena to even the score, and breaking her again in the last game to win the set 7–5 after fifty-three minutes. Venus struggled again with her serve in the beginning of the second set, saving a <b>break</b> <b>point</b> in her first service game, She was broken in her second, but broke back to 2–2. Both players then held their serve up to 5–4, when Serena found herself serving to stay in the match at 15-40, saving the first match point, but losing the second on an unforced error to give Venus the break and a 7–5, 6–4 victory after one hour and eleven minutes of play.

25|$|The men's doubles final {{followed}} the women's singles' one on Centre Court. The eighth-seeded team of ATP doubles No. 21 and former World No. 1 and three-time Wimbledon doubles champion Jonas Björkman & current ATP doubles No. 14, partner Kevin Ullyett, the oldest pair in the field, both aged thirty-six, met the World No. 2 duo of Daniel Nestor, a Wimbledon 2002 runner-up & Nenad Zimonjić, a finalist at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in 2004 and 2006. Both teams remained close {{through the first}} two sets, with neither pair breaking the other, and each set going to a tie-break, the first won 14–12 by Nestor & Zimonjic, the second 7–3 by Bjorkman & Ullyett. The second seeds proved more efficient in the third set, winning their only <b>break</b> <b>point</b> and holding their advantage to the end to take a two-sets-to-one lead. The fourth set resembled the third, with Nestor & Zimonjic converting their two break points, while their opponents were unable to attack them on their service games. Nestor & Zimonjic won the match 7–6(12), 6–7(3), 6–3, 6–3, after more than two-hours-and-a-half of play, making them the 2008 Wimbledon champions. The victory marked Nestor & Zimonjic's first as a team in a Grand Slam tournament, after finishing as the runners-up of the French Open. It also allowed Nestor to become the twenty-first player in tennis history and the eleventh in the Open Era to complete a career Grand Slam, after winning previously at the 2002 Australian Open, the 2004 US Open and the 2007 French Open. He is also the third male player to complete a career Golden Slam, as Nestor also won the Gold Medal at the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Federer next {{participated in}} the Indian Wells Masters in Indian Wells, California. Federer had come down with flu-like {{symptoms}} prior to his opening match due to a virus that had spread around the players {{at the beginning of}} the tournament. After receiving a bye into the second round, he faced American qualifier Denis Kudla, and dispatched him in straight sets. He next faced young up-and-coming Canadian Milos Raonic. Raonic grabbed a tight first set after winning the set tiebreaker, but Federer came back strong with two break points in the second set to level the match. Federer found a <b>break</b> <b>point</b> late in the third set and held to secure a close three-set win over Raonic. Still recovering from his illness, Federer played Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci, who had received a walkover from the third round, the day after his match with Raonic. Bellucci took advantage of a shaky Federer to win the first set, but Federer found his rhythm and fought back to win the next two sets and the match with two crucial break points, one of which was also match point. Federer then played Juan Martín del Potro for the fourth time in the season in the quarterfinals. After winning three break points throughout the match, Federer defeated del Potro in 69 minutes, earning his 250th career Masters 1000 win. He then faced archrival Rafael Nadal, whom he had last played in his loss in the Australian Open semifinals. Rain delays kept the two rivals off the court for a few hours, but when they began playing, Federer got off to a fast start, securing two break points to win the set with ease. He then capitalized on two more break points to give himself a big lead. After fending off a late comeback by Nadal and waiting out a short rain delay after drawing match point, Federer sealed the match with an ace, recording his tenth career win over Nadal. In the final, Federer met American John Isner, who had beaten him in their last meeting in the Davis Cup, and defeated him in straight sets, clinching a record-tying 19th Masters 1000 title.|$|E
