5|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to superficially distinguish <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> bigfin reef squids. Some authors say that females are generally smaller than males, but this distinction is not observed in other studies. Closer examination of sexually mature specimens, however, will usually distinguish males from females by the presence of the hectocotylus on the fourth left arm in males, and the nidamental glands and the pale ovaries within the mantle in females. Males also purportedly show a more conspicuous pattern of transverse streaks on their dorsal side.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in beak size {{may have}} affected behaviour. Such dimorphism is common in other parrots, for example in the palm cockatoo and the New Zealand kaka. In species where it occurs, the sexes prefer food of different sizes, the males use their beaks in rituals, or the sexes have specialised roles in nesting and rearing. Similarly, the large difference <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> head size may have been reflected in the ecology of each sex, though {{it is impossible to}} determine how.|$|E
40|$|There are {{substantial}} phenotypic differences <b>between</b> the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> human.

5|$|Like all Australasian robins, {{the flame}} robin is a perch and pounce hunter, mainly eating insects, and often {{returning}} to a favourite low perch several times to stand erect and motionless, scanning the leaf-litter for more prey. They are typically seen in pairs (during {{the spring and summer}} breeding season) or in loose companies in more open country in winter, when they more commonly feed on the ground. A field study in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales found no significant difference in foraging behaviour <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> flame robins. Birds have been recorded foraging for insects in furrows in freshly ploughed fields. In Deniliquin, a flame robin was observed holding one foot forward and pattering the ground repeatedly to disturb ground-dwelling insects, and then watching and snapping up any which emerged; this behaviour is otherwise seen in waders.|$|E

40|$|Male {{mortality}} excess by {{causes of}} death in selected European countries in 2000 - 2013 period Abstract The aim of this thesis is to analyse and to evaluate current differences in mortality <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> in selected European countries by {{causes of death}}. The thesis tries to capture the main features of so-called <b>male</b> mortality excess, <b>and</b> also tries to find its specifics in each individual state. Selected countries (the Czech Republic, Sweden, France and Spain) represent individual European macro-regions. The analyzed causes of death (neoplasms, diseases of nervous system, diseases of circulatory system, diseases of respiratory system and external causes) were selected based on the highest difference {{in the proportion of}} standardized mortality rates in total mortality <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females.</b> In the analytical part of the thesis, the methods of standardization, mortality tables and Pollard's two-dimensional decomposition of the difference in life expectancy at birth <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> are used. To illustrate the situation of male mortality excess on the different groups of causes of death, contour plots of contributions to the difference in life expectancy at birth <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> were created.

5|$|Zebra {{sharks are}} usually solitary, though aggregations of 2050 {{individuals}} have been recorded. Off southeast Queensland, aggregations {{of several hundred}} zebra sharks form every summer in shallow water. These aggregations consist entirely of large adults, with females outnumbering males by almost three to one. The purpose of these aggregations is yet unclear; no definite mating behavior has been observed between the sharks. There is an observation of an adult male zebra shark biting the pectoral fin of another adult male and pushing him against the sea floor; the second male was turned on his back, and remained motionless for several minutes. This behavior resembles pre-copulatory behaviors <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> sharks, and {{in both cases the}} biting and holding of the pectoral fin has been speculated to relate to one shark asserting dominance over the other.|$|E

The latter characteristic is probably given how many majority Muslim nations are net oil exporters.|$|E

40|$|International audienceUrban areas {{encompass}} both favorable and stressful conditions {{linked with}} human activities and pollution. Pollutants remain of major ecological importance for synanthropic organisms {{living in the}} city. Plumage of urban birds harbour trace metals, which can result from external deposition or from internal accumulation. External and internal plumage concentrations likely differ between specific trace metals, and may further differ <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> because of potential sex-linked differential urban use, physiology or behaviour. Here, we measured the concentrations in four trace metals (cadmium, copper, lead and zinc) in both unwashed and washed feathers of 49 <b>male</b> <b>and</b> 38 <b>female</b> feral pigeons (Columba livia) from Parisian agglomeration. We found that these concentrations indeed differed between unwashed <b>and</b> washed feathers, <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females,</b> <b>and</b> for some metals depended on the interaction between these factors. We discuss these results {{in the light of}} physiological <b>and</b> behavioural differences <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> <b>and</b> of spatial repartition of the four trace metals in the city...|$|R

The methodology {{of this paper is}} based on studying and analyzing the topic of wage differentials <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> by using the Oaxaca decomposition technique. The data used in the analysis is obtained from the Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey 2006 (ELMPS 2006), which was presented by Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) in cooperation with Economic Research Forum (ERF). The findings of this paper help deepen the understanding of the wage gap <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> in Egypt by determining differences in wages due to real variations in characteristics between both genders, for example, education and experience and differences due to discrimination against women in addition to determining differences due to selectivity bias. It is estimated that, the wage gap <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> is 25 % and the results ascertain that the overall gap is attributed to discrimination against women...|$|R
