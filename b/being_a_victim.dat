5|$|Meyerbeer's immense wealth (increased by {{the success}} of his operas) and his {{continuing}} adherence to his Jewish religion set him apart somewhat from many of his musical contemporaries. They also gave rise to rumours that his success was due to his bribing musical critics. Richard Wagner (see below) accused him of being interested only in money, not music. Meyerbeer was, however, a deeply serious musician and a sensitive personality. He philosophically resigned himself to <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of his own success: his extensive diaries and correspondence – which survived the turmoil of 20th-century Europe and have now been published in eight volumes – are an invaluable source for the history of music and theatre in the composer's time.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the mentioned health risks (like unwanted pregnancies and infection transmissions), other risks {{have been associated with}} early sexual activity.

In February 1945, 33 and 222 Sqns. of 135 Wing converted from Spitfire Mk IXs and, in March, were joined by 274 Sqn. 135 Wing was based at B.77 Gilze-Rijen airfield in the Netherlands.

[...] {{as a point of}} confusion, in which the song transitions to become more [...] "directed at Mrs. Carter-Knowles' decisions." [...] In Touch Weeklys Carly Sitzer viewed the track as [...] "ultra-confusing", and cast doubt on Liv's claims of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> and the object of Beyoncé's jealousy.

500|$|From the {{original}} release date of October 2002, {{the album was}} pushed to December in the same year, and to May in the following year.

[...] Scholar Liliane Arensberg calls this presentation Angelou's [...] "identity theme" [...] and a major motif in Angelou's narrative. [...] Maya's unsettled life in Caged Bird suggests her sense of self [...] "as perpetually in the process of becoming, of dying and being reborn, in all its ramifications". African-American literature scholar Dolly McPherson agrees, stating that Angelou creatively uses Christian mythology and theology to present the Biblical themes of death, regeneration, and rebirth.|$|E

500|$|It was in {{the video}} of [...] "Material Girl" [...] that Madonna began to accept and utilize herself being {{compared}} to Monroe. However, she established a safe distance from those comparisons and developed inside the same pastiche. Details like the usage of different gloves or different fans in the video brought forth the connections between these women, but Madonna alluded to herself in subtle ways. The fan in Monroe's hand for the original video was an iconography of the Sudarshana Chakra (wheel) held by the Indian idol Vishnu. Scholar Georges-Claude Guilbert, who wrote Madonna as postmodern myth: how one star's self-construction rewrites sex, said that the fan symbolized fiery desire aroused by Monroe as well as ritual sacrifice, eerily foreshadowing her untimely death in 1962. Madonna's fan, which appeared {{at the end of}} the video, signified that Madonna– while paying her tribute to Monroe– was signaling that she had no intention of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> like her, and that she was on the path of becoming a feminist post-modern myth. Author Nicholas Cook commented that the video promoted Madonna's identity as the song suggested, with the purpose of shifting [...] "Madonna's image from that of a disco-bimbo to authentic star." [...] Lisa A. Lewis, author of Gender, Politics and MTV said that with the video, Madonna achieved the rare distinction of being accepted as a literature medium by the music authors. [...] "Material Girl" [...] was nominated for best female video at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards but lost to Tina Turner's [...] "What's Love Got to Do with It". The video was ranked at position 54 on VH1's 100 Greatest Videos.|$|E
