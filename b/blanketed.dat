5|$|Due to {{a higher}} {{elevation}} and level of precipitation, the Black Hills ecology differs significantly from the plains. The mountains are thickly <b>blanketed</b> by various types of pines, including ponderosa and lodgepole pines, as well as spruces. Black Hills mammals include deer, elk (wapiti), bighorn sheep, mountain goats, pine marten, and mountain lions, while the streams and lakes contain several species of trout.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the three}} climactic eruptions {{released}} vast amounts of ash that <b>blanketed</b> much of central North America, falling many hundreds of miles away. The amount of ash and gases released into the atmosphere probably caused significant impacts to world weather patterns {{and led to the}} extinction of some species, primarily in North America.|$|E
5|$|Starting 20 {{million years}} ago (in the Cenozoic) and lasting until 5 {{million years ago}}, a now-extinct {{extension}} of Cascade Range volcanoes erupted, bringing large amounts of igneous material in the area. These igneous deposits <b>blanketed</b> the region north of the Yosemite region. Volcanic activity persisted past 5 million years BP east of the current park borders in the Mono Lake and Long Valley areas.|$|E

50|$|To <b>blanket</b> train a child, a {{caretaker}} places the infant or toddler on a <b>blanket</b> and punishes the child {{when he or}} she attempts to leave the <b>blanket.</b> Proponents of <b>blanket</b> training believe that eventually the child will stay on the <b>blanket</b> without adult intervention or enforcement because the child has come to associate leaving the <b>blanket</b> with pain.|$|R
50|$|Navajo tribes used special {{indigo dye}} from Mexico and other vegetal dyes to color {{multi-ply}} yarns and weave them into three main types of <b>blankets</b> - a serape (a shoulder covering <b>blanket</b> that {{is longer than}} it is wide), a saddle <b>blanket</b> (a <b>blanket</b> that was folded in half under a horse’s saddle for extra cushioning), and a chief's <b>blanket</b> (a shoulder <b>blanket</b> that was made wider than it was long).|$|R
5|$|Somewhere between 100 and 200 {{million years}} after the Serenitatis basin and Taurus–Littrow formed, the lavas that began to seep through the lunar crust began to flood the low-lying areas. These lava flows were often {{accompanied}} by fire fountains that <b>blanketed</b> the surrounding area with tiny glass beads. These beads were sometimes colored orange, explaining the orange soil discovered by the Apollo 17 astronauts at Shorty crater. Most of these beads, however, were darkly colored, resulting in the dark appearance of the Serenitatis basin from Earth.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Infantry {{consistently}} captured Battle Mountain in {{the same}} way. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire raked the crest and air strikes employing napalm <b>blanketed</b> {{the top of the}} peak. Then, the infantry attacked from the hill beneath the east slope of the summit. Supporting mortars would set up a base of fire and kept the heights under barrage until the infantry had arrived at a point just short of the crest. The mortar fire then lifted and the infantry moved rapidly up the last stretch to the top, usually to find it abandoned by the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} {{is set on}} a post-apocalyptic version of Mount Desert Island, known in-game as The Island, which is north-east of the Commonwealth, Fallouts post-apocalyptic version of Boston, Massachusetts. The starting point is the town of Far Harbor. The Island, where many unique creatures reside, is <b>blanketed</b> by radioactive fog. Because the creatures that live inside the fog are unwilling to go anywhere without it, the town uses devices called fog condensers to turn the fog into liquid {{in order to protect}} its inhabitants.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>blanket</b> called GO-GO <b>Blanket</b> {{holds the}} US patent for child-sized sleeved <b>blankets.</b> GO-GO <b>Blanket</b> was {{created as a}} travel <b>blanket</b> for {{children}} (up to size 5) which complies with federal safety regulations for car seats and strollers.

50|$|The {{misconception}} persists {{that originally}} the points were {{an indication of}} the <b>blanket</b> price in beaver pelts or even its weight. Thickness and quality are the same <b>blanket</b> to <b>blanket,</b> and a larger <b>blanket</b> will naturally weigh more.|$|R
50|$|The family resumed the {{production}} of Native-American <b>blankets</b> and introduced new designs, colors, and patterns to their product line. They also changed {{the construction of the}} mill's Native-American <b>blankets.</b> Prior to 1909 the <b>blankets</b> had round corners. The Bishop <b>blankets</b> featured square corners. Pendleton round corner <b>blankets</b> are highly coveted by vintage Native-American <b>blanket</b> collectors. The company expanded their trade from the local Native-American tribes of the Columbia River area, to the Navajo, Hopi, and Zuni peoples of the American Southwest. To do this, they enlisted the help of designer Joe Rawnsley, who visited tribes to learn their customs and color preferences. Like many other mills of the day, Pendleton emulated the multicolor patterns of candy-stripe <b>blankets,</b> like those found on Hudson's Bay point <b>blankets,</b> for their Glacier National Park <b>blanket.</b> The Pendleton <b>blankets</b> were not only basic wearing apparel, but were standards of trading and ceremonial use.|$|R
5|$|The hill is <b>blanketed</b> in heather, {{which gives}} it a deep purple colour during the summer. Ling and bell heather, gorse, sessile oak, ash, rowan, hazel, bracken, mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns all grow on the hill or in {{surrounding}} woodland, {{as well as some}} unique whitebeam species. Exmoor ponies, red deer, pied flycatchers, wood warblers, lesser spotted woodpeckers, redstarts, dippers, snipe, skylarks and kestrels are some of the fauna to be found on or around the hill and in nearby Horner Woods, home to 14 of the 16 UK bat species and including barbastelle and Bechstein's bats.|$|E
5|$|The upper-level low {{associated}} with the hurricane's remnants <b>blanketed</b> parts of the Alps with heavy snowfall, accumulating to several feet, and subsequently fueled torrential rains in the Balkans on October24 and25. Floodwaters caused by estimated rainfall totals nearing 6in (150mm) inundated entire villages in southeastern Bulgaria, forcing hundreds to evacuate, and there were widespread disruptions of power and water services. A woman in Burgas died from drowning. In the Greek capital city of Athens, the deluge filled streets with rushing water that swept away hundreds of vehicles. More than 300buildings were inundated in the Attica area.|$|E
5|$|Within {{hours of}} Dugard's disappearance, local and {{national}} media converged on South Lake Tahoe to cover the story. Within days, dozens of local volunteers assisted in the search effort, which involved nearly every resource within the community. Within weeks, {{tens of thousands of}} fliers and posters were mailed to businesses throughout the United States. Since her favorite color was pink, the town was <b>blanketed</b> in pink ribbons as a constant reminder of her disappearance, and as a demonstration of support for her family by the community.|$|E
50|$|J. E. Ashworth & Sons was {{a company}} that {{operated}} <b>blanket</b> mills in Hartland, Vermont, Westbrookville, New York and Whippany, New Jersey.

5|$|Active for millennia, Mount Redoubt has erupted {{four times}} {{since it was}} first observed: in 1902, 1966, 1989 and 2009, with two {{questionable}} eruptions in 1881 and 1933. The eruption in 1989 spewed volcanic ash to a height of 45,000ft (14,000m). It caught KLM Flight 867, a Boeing 747 aircraft, in its plume. After the plane descended 13,000 feet, the pilots restarted the engines and landed the plane safely at Anchorage. The ash <b>blanketed</b> an area of about 7,700sqmi (20,000km2). The 1989 eruption is also notable for being the first ever volcanic eruption to be successfully predicted by the method of long-period seismic events developed by Swiss/American volcanologist Bernard Chouet. As of August 2015, the Alaska Volcano Observatory has rated Redoubt as Aviation Alert Level Green and Volcano Alert Level Normal.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to higher}} {{elevation}} and precipitation, {{the ecology of}} the Black Hills differs significantly from that of the plains. The mountains are thickly <b>blanketed</b> by coniferous needleleaf evergreens: various types of pines—including ponderosa (covering , or 80% of the Black Hills forest), lodgepole, white, and timber—as well as western red cedar and spruces. Western yellow ponderosa is the most important lumber tree in the area. The South Dakota state tree is the Black Hills spruce. The Red Valley is home to blue-joint and bluegrasses, and wild plum, Juneberry, and chokecherry shrubs grow in the Hills. Violets, thistles, and horse mint are prevalent herbs. Vines grow widely: the woodbine, bittersweet, and wild grape, which is the pattern for Black Hills gold jewelry.|$|E
5|$|Garfield's funeral train left Long Branch on {{the same}} special track that brought him there, {{traveling}} over tracks <b>blanketed</b> with flowers and past houses adorned with flags. His body was transported to the Capitol and then continued on to Cleveland for burial. More than 70,000 citizens, some waiting over three hours, passed by Garfield's coffin as his body lay in state in Washington; later, on September 25, 1881, in Cleveland, more than 150,000—a number equal to {{the entire population of}} that city—likewise paid their respects. His body was temporarily interred in a vault in Cleveland's Lake View Cemetery until his permanent memorial was built.|$|E
5000|$|Witney {{has been}} {{famous for its}} woollen <b>blankets</b> since the Middle Ages. The water for the {{production}} of these <b>blankets</b> is drawn from the River Windrush, which was believed to be the secret of Witney's high-quality <b>blankets.</b> The <b>Blanket</b> Hall in High Street was built in 1721 for weighing and measuring <b>blankets.</b> At one time there were five <b>blanket</b> factories in the town but with the closure of the largest <b>blanket</b> maker, in 2002, Early's, the town's <b>blanket</b> industry completely ceased production. Early's factory, once a vital and important part of the town's history, has now been demolished, and is the site of several new housing estates. Witney United FC retains its nickname [...] "The Blanketmen" [...] from the town's traditional trade.|$|R
40|$|In fusion reactors, the <b>blanket</b> {{design and}} its {{characteristics}} {{have a major}} impact on the reactor performance, size, and economics. The selection and arrangement of the <b>blanket</b> materials, dimensions of the different <b>blanket</b> zones, and different requirements of the selected materials for a satisfactory performance are the main parameters, which define the <b>blanket</b> performance. These parameters translate to a large number of variables and design constraints, which need to be simultaneously considered in the <b>blanket</b> design process. This represents a major design challenge because of the lack of a comprehensive design tool capable of considering all these variables to define the optimum <b>blanket</b> design and satisfying all the design constraints for the adopted figure of merit and the <b>blanket</b> design criteria. The <b>blanket</b> design techniques of the First Wall/Blanket/Shield Design and Optimization System (BSDOS) have been developed to overcome this difficulty and to provide the state-of-the-art techniques and tools for performing <b>blanket</b> design and analysis. This report describes some of the BSDOS techniques and demonstrates its use. In addition, the use of the optimization technique of the BSDOS can result in a significant <b>blanket</b> performance enhancement and cost saving for the reactor design under consideration. In this report, examples are presented, which utilize an earlier version of the ITER solid breeder <b>blanket</b> design and a high power density self-cooled lithium <b>blanket</b> design for demonstrating some of the BSDOS <b>blanket</b> design techniques...|$|R

5|$|Avatar was {{released}} internationally {{on more than}} 14,000 screens. It earned $3,537,000 from midnight screenings domestically (United States and Canada), with the initial 3D release limited to 2,200 screens. The film earned $26,752,099 on its opening day, and $77,025,481 over its opening weekend, making it the second-largest December opening ever behind I Am Legend, the largest domestic opening weekend for a film not based on a franchise (topping The Incredibles), the highest opening weekend for a film entirely in 3D (breaking Ups record), the highest opening weekend for an environmentalist film (breaking The Day After Tomorrows record), and the 40th largest opening weekend in North America, despite a blizzard that <b>blanketed</b> the East Coast of the United States and reportedly hurt its opening weekend results. The film also set an IMAX opening weekend record, with 178 theaters generating approximately $9.5million, 12% of the film's $77million (at the time) North American gross on less than 3% of the screens.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{lived in}} a vast {{floodplain}} along the western shore of the interior seaway. Large rivers watered the land, occasionally flooding and blanketing the region with new sediment. When water was plentiful, the region could support {{a great deal of}} plant and animal life, but periodic droughts also struck the region, resulting in mass mortality as preserved in the many bonebed deposits found in Two Medicine and Judith River sediments, including the Daspletosaurus bonebed. Similar conditions exist today in East Africa. Volcanic eruptions from the west periodically <b>blanketed</b> the region with ash, also resulting in large-scale mortality, while simultaneously enriching the soil for future plant growth. It is these ash beds that allow precise radiometric dating as well. Fluctuating sea levels also resulted in a variety of other environments at different times and places within the Judith River Group, including offshore and nearshore marine habitats, coastal wetlands, deltas and lagoons, in addition to the inland floodplains. The Two Medicine Formation was deposited at higher elevations farther inland than the other two formations.|$|E
5|$|In June 1951, {{with peace}} talks {{underway}} in Panmunjom, the Ranger company was employed aggressively in offensive roles {{as a means}} to secure a better position for the UN at the bargaining table. After a number of operations north of the 38th parallel with the 7th Division, on 8 June the Rangers were moved to attack Hill 772, an operation crafted by Allen to win a strategically advantageous high ground position along the front line. That morning, the company, with support from 7th Division artillery, advanced on the hill, which was first <b>blanketed</b> with napalm strikes from U.S. Air Force P-51 Mustangs. Chinese forces resisted sporadically but withdrew {{at the end of the}} day having lost eight men killed and another thirty wounded. Against this the Rangers had lost only seven wounded. On 11 July, the Rangers continued the attack, backed by the 31st RCT who seized high ground near Sanying-ni and forced Chinese troops to retreat further. In this attack, one Ranger was killed and eight were wounded.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy IX {{takes place}} {{primarily}} on the four continents of a world named Gaia. Most of Gaia's population reside on the Mist Continent, named so because the entire continent is <b>blanketed</b> in thick Mist. Lands outside the Mist Continent—the Outer, Lost and Forgotten continents—are uncharted territories not explored until midway through the game. Several locations in the parallel world of Terra and the dream land of Memoria round out the game's areas. The Mist Continent features four nations: Alexandria, Lindblum, Burmecia, and Cleyra. Alexandria is a kingdom to the northeast of the Mist Continent ruled by a monarchy located in Alexandria Castle. The technologically advanced Lindblum, governed by a regent, is nestled on a plateau to the southwest where airships regularly fly by. The Kingdom of Burmecia, whose capital is showered by eternal rain is to the northwest and nearby to the isolated Cleyran civilization, which is nestled in a giant tree in the desert, protected by a powerful sandstorm. Treno, a large, perpetually dark city, heavily populated by both aristocrats and paupers, {{is located in the}} southeast part of the continent. The Mist Continent is extremely mountainous resulting in a natural barrier between many of the ruling nations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} an analytical tool to quantify material consistency of offset printing <b>blankets.</b> Printing <b>blankets</b> are essentially viscoelastic rubber composites of several laminas. High levels of material consistency are expected from rubber <b>blankets</b> for quality print and for quick recovery from smash encountered during the printing process. The present study aims at determining objectively the consistency of printing <b>blankets</b> at three specific torque levels of tension under two distinct stages; 1. under normal printing conditions and 2. on recovery after smash. The experiment devised exhibits a variation in tone reproduction properties of each <b>blanket</b> signifying the levels of inconsistency also in thickness direction. Correlation technique was employed on ink density variations obtained from the <b>blanket</b> on paper. Both <b>blankets</b> exhibited good consistency over three torque levels under normal printing conditions. However on smash the recovery of <b>blanket</b> and its consistency was a function of manufacturing and torque levels.
