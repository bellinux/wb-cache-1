5|$|By mid-March, a {{provision}} in the stimulus package that grandfathered in bonuses paid to executives at troubled insurance giant AIG and other TARP recipients became a campaign issue. Tedisco, who had been criticized by Murphy for opposing the package, used the outrage over the AIG bonuses to reframe the debate. On March 19, Tedisco called for the resignation of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner over the AIG controversy. Murphy responded <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> the stimulus package was necessary for job creation.|$|E
5|$|In October 1941, Reggie {{was offered}} a post as {{lecturer}} at Farouk University in Alexandria. The couple moved from Cairo to share a flat with fellow teacher Robert Liddell. The Germans regularly bombed the city, and the raids terrified Manning, who irritated Reggie and Liddell <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> all three descend to the air raid shelter whenever the sirens wailed. Almost immediately after her arrival in Alexandria came devastating news of her brother Oliver's death in a plane crash. The emotional upset this caused prevented her from writing novels for several years.|$|E
5|$|On June 18, 2015, Manitoba Premier Greg Selinger {{became the}} first {{politician}} to issue a formal apology for the government's role in the Sixties Scoop. Class action lawsuits have been brought against the Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario governments for the harm caused to victims of the large-scale adoption scheme that saw thousands of Indigenous children forcibly removed from their parents in the 1960s. Indigenous leaders responded <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> while apologies were welcomed, action – including a federal apology, reunification of families, compensation and counselling for victims – must accompany words {{for them to have}} real meaning.|$|E
60|$|At the shore, {{directly}} in front of the stockade, the Indians forced a halt of the white men, <b>by</b> seemingly <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> some other method of procedure be adopted, and during two or three minutes it appeared as if they would carry their point.|$|R

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Carthage, he {{justified}} his decision to turn back <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> the entire army was needed to quell the insurgents, and urged Guntharic to set forth himself. At the same time, he conspired with his nephew, Gregory, {{and a few other}} of his Armenian bodyguards to murder the usurper (although Corippus suggests that it was the praetorian prefect Athanasius who was the real mastermind of the plot). On the eve of the army's departure in early May, Guntharic hosted a great banquet, and invited Artabanes and Athanasius to share the same couch, a mark of honour. Suddenly, during the banquet, Artabanes' Armenians fell upon Guntharic's bodyguards, while Artabanes himself allegedly landed the killing blow on Guntharic.|$|E
5|$|By 1182 Young Henry reiterated his {{previous}} demands: {{he wanted to}} be granted lands, for example the Duchy of Normandy, which would allow him to support himself and his household with dignity. Henry refused, but agreed to increase his son's allowance, but this was not enough to placate Young Henry. With trouble clearly brewing, Henry attempted to defuse the situation <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> Richard and Geoffrey give homage to Young Henry for their lands. Richard did not believe that Young Henry had any claim over Aquitaine and refused to give homage; when Henry forced Richard to give homage, Young Henry angrily refused to accept it. Young Henry formed an alliance with some of the disgruntled barons of the Aquitaine who were unhappy with Richard's rule, and Geoffrey sided with him, raising a mercenary army in Brittany to threaten Poitou. Open war broke out in 1183 and Henry and Richard led a joint campaign into Aquitaine: before they could conclude it, however, Young Henry caught a fever and died, bringing a sudden end to the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1386, at the Palais de Justice in Paris the two claimants {{faced each}} other {{for the first time since}} their {{confrontation}} at Argentan several months before. Each stepped before the Parlement in turn and presented their case for the King and court, Carrouges throwing down his gauntlet in challenge and Le Gris picking it up signifying his acceptance of the duel. Le Gris also embellished his case <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> should he be proven innocent of the offence, he would sue Carrouges or his estate for 40,000 livres. Following the declarations a number of high-ranking noblemen stepped forward to act as seconds in the duel for both men, including Waleran of Saint-Pol for Carrouges and Philip of Artois, Count of Eu for Le Gris. After hearing the challenges and accusations, the Parlement and King debated the case and decided that a full hearing of the evidence from witnesses would be held to determine guilt. If the case could not be decided by normal means, then a judicial duel would be held to adjudicate the dispute, God choosing the victor.|$|E

50|$|The referee {{had little}} {{option but to}} declare a draw, but Heenan complained bitterly that police had colluded with Sayers {{supporters}} in breaking up the fight {{as soon as it}} became clear that the Englishman was beaten. Sayers supporters, <b>by</b> contrast, <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> their man had been the likely winner. The wrangling went on for some weeks.|$|R
25|$|In {{his travels}} through German-occupied countries, her husband {{observed}} many human rights abuses, which {{he attempted to}} thwart <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> Germany observe the Geneva Convention (it continued not to) and through local actions in creating more benign outcomes for local inhabitants, citing legal principles.|$|E
25|$|For both m {{even and}} m odd, the {{freedom in the}} choice of B may be {{restricted}} to an overall scale <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> the bilinear form ' corresponding to B satisfies (1), where ' is a fixed antiautomorphism (either reversion or conjugation).|$|E
25|$|A leak {{concerning}} HMS Barham {{was later}} discovered. A {{secretary of the}} First Lord had been indiscreet to Professor Michael Postan of the Ministry of Economic Warfare.

25|$|Two years later, 1897, Rusk, his mother, and {{his sister}} climbed Adams again. Afterwards, {{they went to the}} Ridge of Wonders and his mother, awestruck <b>by</b> the scene, <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> it should be known as such.|$|R

25|$|According to Oswald, he {{met with}} four more Soviet {{officials}} that same day, who asked {{if he wanted to}} return to the United States. Oswald replied <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> he wanted to live in the Soviet Union as a Soviet national. When pressed for identification papers, he provided his Marine Corps discharge papers.|$|E
25|$|Barclays also {{provides}} two of Mugabe's associates with bank accounts, ignoring European Union sanctions on Zimbabwe. The men are Elliot Manyika and minister {{of public service}} Nicholas Goche. Barclays has defended its position <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> the EU rules {{do not apply to}} its 67%-owned Zimbabwean subsidiary because it was incorporated outside the EU.|$|E
25|$|Games are {{the main}} example {{considered}} by Wittgenstein in his text where he also mentions numbers and makes an analogy with a thread. He develops his argument further <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> in such cases {{there is not a}} clear cut boundary but there arises some ambiguity if this indefiniteness can be separated from the main point.|$|E
2500|$|Several demands {{were made}} <b>by</b> CBS, <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> a {{pregnant}} woman could not be shown on television, nor could the word [...] "pregnant" [...] be spoken on-air. After approval from several religious figures the network allowed the pregnancy storyline, but <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the word [...] "expecting" [...] be used instead of [...] "pregnant". (Arnaz garnered laughs when he deliberately mispronounced it as [...] "'spectin'".) The episode's official title was [...] "Lucy Is Enceinte", borrowing the French word for pregnant; however, episode titles never appeared on the show.|$|R

25|$|Some parents {{believe that}} {{intensive}} behavioral therapy {{is the only}} way to alleviate autistic children's disabilities. Some critics also fear that the movement will prevent autistic children from receiving important therapies. Kit Weintraub has responded to Michelle Dawson's claims that ABA is harmful <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> it is medically necessary and appropriate treatment, and that it is harmful to deny it to autistic children who need it.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire put {{themselves}} {{at a disadvantage}} from 1968 until 1992 <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> all its players must have been born within the historic county boundaries of Yorkshire while all the other county teams strengthened themselves by signing overseas Test players. In 1992, the birth qualification rule was first modified to include those educated within the county, a dispensation that allowed Michael Vaughan to play; and was then abandoned altogether. Yorkshire's first overseas player that season was 19-year-old Sachin Tendulkar.|$|E
25|$|During the litigation, it was {{determined}} that the company's scientists and management had taken considerable precautions to protect themselves from the effects of radiation, yet had not seen fit to protect their employees. Additionally, for several years the companies had attempted to cover up the effects and avoid liability <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> the Radium Girls were instead suffering from syphilis. This complete disregard for employee welfare {{had a significant impact on}} the formulation of occupational disease labor law.|$|E
25|$|During the 1917 Russian Revolution, Nimzowitsch {{was in the}} Baltic war zone.

25|$|When the {{parliament}} met on 30 July, the speaker (Kamuta Latasi) {{refused to allow}} a debate on a no-confidence motion {{in the government of}} Willy Telavi. Taom Tanukale, the health minister, resigned from {{the parliament}} (and thus also from the government). This resignation appeared to be political manoeuvre as Willy Telavi responded <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> parliament should be suspended until a by-election was held and declined to call the by-election. In Tuvalu a by-election can only be called when requested by the prime Mmnister.|$|E
25|$|This {{motion was}} later {{withdrawn}} due to McQueen's powers of persuasion. However, McQueen's problems were not over. Council moved {{to reduce his}} authority <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> he produce a Principal's report for each Council meeting. This also highlighted Gillespie's {{lack of confidence in}} him as this had never before been the practice at Croydon, nor was it the case at Gillespie's other school, Knox Grammar School. This clash of personalities continued for another six years with the authority of the Principal being eaten away year by year.|$|E
25|$|The {{parliament}} convened on 30 July 2013.

His resignation appeared to be political manoeuvre as Willy Telavi responded <b>by</b> <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> parliament should be suspended until a by-election was held and declined to call the by-election.
