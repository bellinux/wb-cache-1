5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great <b>black</b> <b>athletes,</b> and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{his success}} on the court, Robertson's college career was soured by racism. In those days, {{southern}} university programs {{such as those of}} Kentucky, Duke, and North Carolina did not recruit <b>black</b> <b>athletes,</b> and road trips to segregated cities were especially difficult, with Robertson often sleeping in college dorms instead of hotels. [...] "I'll never forgive them", he told The Indianapolis Star years later. Decades after his college days, Robertson's stellar NCAA career was rewarded by the United States Basketball Writers Association when, in 1998, they renamed the trophy awarded to the NCAA Division I Player of the Year the Oscar Robertson Trophy. This honor brought the award full circle for Robertson since he had won the first two awards ever presented.|$|E
500|$|Besides {{changing}} {{the types of}} sports being covered, {{the manner in which}} they were covered changed as well. [...] Under earlier managing editors, the magazine's writing and editorial staff was organized by department. [...] Thus, there was a fashion department, a travel department, and a sports department, which covered all sports. [...] Laguerre reorganized the magazine, giving each sport its own separate department, so there would be a dedicated staff of writers in the baseball department, and a different boxing department, and another for pro football, and so on. [...] Laguerre also encouraged serious investigative journalism, and did not shy away from controversial issues. [...] In 1961, writer Ray Cave broke a story on point shaving in college basketball. [...] In 1968, under Laguerre's direction, and under secrecy from his superiors, the magazine ran a five-part series on the experience of <b>black</b> <b>athletes</b> in America.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Brown arrived in Cleveland, {{the team had}} signed a number of players to its roster, {{including}} quarterback Otto Graham, whose Northwestern squad had beaten the Buckeyes in 1941. Many of the players came from Ohio State, Great Lakes and Massillon teams that Brown coached. Lou Groza, a placekicker and tackle, played for Brown at Ohio State before the war intervened. Receiver Dante Lavelli was a sophomore on Ohio State's championship-winning team in 1942. Bill Willis, a defensive lineman whom Brown coached at Ohio State, and Marion Motley, a running back {{who grew up in}} Canton and played for Brown at Great Lakes, became two of the first <b>black</b> <b>athletes</b> to play professional football when they joined the team in 1946. Other signings included receiver Mac Speedie, center Frank Gatski and back Edgar [...] "Special Delivery" [...] Jones. Brown brought in assistants including Blanton Collier, who had been stationed at Great Lakes and met Brown at Bluejackets practices.|$|E
500|$|A {{parallel}} {{problem was}} that of Rhodesia, the British colony which had unilaterally declared its independence from Great Britain in 1965. Rhodesia had a white minority government. In May 1968, the United Nations Security Council condemned its government and asked nations not to honor its passports, and the Mexican government, set to host the Olympics later that year, complied with the ban. The IOC initially believed that sports facilities in the breakaway colony were not segregated, despite its government's policies. The proposed 16-member Olympic team included two <b>black</b> <b>athletes.</b> Because of this, Brundage supported Rhodesian participation at Mexico City, but he was overruled by the IOC; according {{to the head of}} the Rhodesian Olympic Committee, Douglas Downing, [...] "His voice cries in a wilderness of spite." [...] For Munich in 1972, the IOC decided to allow the Rhodesians to compete as British subjects, which by international law they were. African nations again threatened to boycott if the Rhodesians were allowed to participate, and, at its Munich session in 1972 just before the Games, the IOC narrowly voted to exclude the Rhodesians. Brundage was livid at the decision, believing that the IOC had yielded to blackmail. In 1974, after Brundage left office, the IOC found evidence of segregated facilities in Rhodesia, and it subsequently withdrew recognition from its NOC. Rhodesia returned to the Olympics in 1980 as recognized independent Zimbabwe.|$|E
500|$|However, the Georgia Tech {{incident}} left Ward {{angry and}} disillusioned. He recalled that it sapped his competitive spirit. Ward considered quitting football, even {{writing a letter}} to Coach Kipke about his intentions of leaving the team. He recalled later that the refusal to let him play against Georgia Tech destroyed his will. [...] "It {{was the fact that}} I couldn't play in the Georgia Tech game. That all of a sudden, the practice that you just did because it was the thing to do that was good—a tremendous amount of burnt up energy—all of a sudden becomes drudgery." [...] His one sports highlight in 1935 was beating Jesse Owens at Yost Fieldhouse in the 60-yard dash and 65 high hurdles. Ward's times were neck-and-neck with Owens' up until the NCAA track and field championship. [...] He took part in the Olympic trials in 1936, but having lost his competitive drive, Ward, in his own words, did not train to his peak and failed to make the U.S. team. [...] "They were urging me to go out in '36," [...] Ward recalled. [...] "But that Georgia Tech game killed me. I frankly felt they would not let <b>black</b> <b>athletes</b> compete. Having gone through the Tech experience, it seemed an easy thing for them to say 'Well, we just won't run 'em if Hitler insists.'" [...] Interviewed about the incident in 1976, Ward said: “It was like any bad experience—you can’t forget it, but you don’t talk about it. It hurts.” ...|$|E

In addition to becoming the first <b>black</b> <b>athlete</b> to play football in Memorial Stadium, Washington also became the first <b>black</b> <b>athlete</b> to score a touchdown in Memorial Stadium, torching the Longhorn defense for a 73-yard touchdown - much {{to the delight of}} the Texas crowd.|$|R

2500|$|Like Robinson and {{the other}} <b>black</b> <b>athletes</b> he had covered, Lacy {{encountered}} racist indignities and hardships. He was barred from press boxes at certain ballparks, dined at the same segregated restaurants with Jackie, and stayed at the same [...] "blacks only" [...] boarding houses as Robinson. Robinson would eventually break MLB's color barrier in 1947 with the Dodgers, but Lacy never allowed their racial bond to cloud his journalistic objectivity. During spring training in 1948, Lacy chastised Robinson in print for arriving 15 pounds overweight, his [...] "lackadaisical attitude" [...] and for [...] "laying down" [...] on the job. He also plastered details of Robinson's personal life throughout his articles, including the dining, shopping, wardrobe and travel habits of Jackie and his wife, Rachel.|$|E

2500|$|In 1960, on {{at least}} one team, a color barrier still existed in the NFL. But Jack Vainisi, the Scouting Director for the Packers, and Lombardi were {{determined}} [...] "to ignore the prejudices then prevalent in most NFL front offices in their search for the most talented players." [...] Lombardi explained his views by saying that he [...] "...viewed his players as neither black nor white, but Packer green". Among professional football head coaches, Lombardi's view on discrimination was not de rigueur {{in the midst of the}} civil rights movement. When Lombardi joined the Packers, they only had one black player, Nate Borden. During his time as coach the team became fully integrated: by 1967 they had 13 <b>black</b> <b>athletes,</b> including All-Pros Willie Davis, Willie Wood, Dave Robinson, Herb Adderley and Bob Jeter.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{graduating from}} high school in 1959, he {{rejected}} a contract from a minor league professional baseball team so that he could attend the University of Illinois on a football scholarship. Following his second semester at the predominantly white University of Illinois, Jackson transferred to the North Carolina A, an historically black university located in Greensboro, North Carolina. There are differing accounts of the reasons behind this transfer. Jackson has claimed that he changed schools because racial prejudice prevented him from playing quarterback and limited his participation on a competitive public-speaking team. Writing on ESPN.com in 2002, sociologist Harry Edwards noted that the University of Illinois had previously had a black quarterback, but also noted that <b>black</b> <b>athletes</b> attending traditionally white colleges during the 1950s and 1960s encountered a [...] "combination of culture shock and discrimination". Edwards also suggested that Jackson had left the University of Illinois in 1960 because he had been placed on academic probation. However, the president of the University of Illinois reported in 1987 that Jackson's 1960 freshman year transcript was clean, and said he would have been eligible to re-enroll at any time.|$|E
2500|$|The growing {{population}} also supported a rich fabric of organizations and {{activities in the}} 1920s. Fraternal orders such as the Prince Hall Masons and the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks set up lodges in Harlem, with elaborate buildings including auditoriums and large bands. Parades of lodge members decked out in uniforms and accompanied by band music were a common sight on Harlem's streets, on public holidays, lodge anniversaries, church festivities and funerals. The neighborhood's churches housed a range of groups, including athletic clubs, choirs and social clubs. [...] A similar range of activities could {{be found at the}} YMCA on 135th Street and the YWCA on 137th Street. The social pages of Harlem's two African-American newspapers, the New York Age and the New York Amsterdam News, recorded the meetings, dinners and dances of hundreds of small clubs. Soapbox speakers drew crowds on Seventh and Lenox Avenues until the 1960s, some offering political oratory, with Hubert Harrison the most famous, while others, particularly in the late 1920s, sold medicine. [...] Harlem also offered a wealth of sporting events: the Lincoln Giants played baseball at Olympic Field at 136th and Fifth Avenue until 1920, after which residents had to travel to the Catholic Protectory Oval in the Bronx; men's and women's basketball teams from local athletic clubs played in church gymnasiums, and, as they became more popular, at the Manhattan Casino on 155th Street, before giving way to professional teams, most famously the Rens, based at the Renaissance Ballroom on Seventh Avenue; and boxing bouts took place at the Commonwealth Casino on East 135th Street (run by white promoters the McMahon brothers). [...] The biggest crowds, including many whites, came to see <b>black</b> <b>athletes</b> compete against whites.|$|E
