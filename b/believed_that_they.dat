5|$|Great Auk calls {{included}} low croaking and {{a hoarse}} scream. A captive great auk was observed making a gurgling noise when anxious. It {{is not known}} what its other vocalizations were, but it is <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were similar to those}} of the razorbill, only louder and deeper.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{operations}} for the incursion {{got off to a}} slow start. Reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since MACV <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might serve as a signal of intention. The role of the Air Force in the planning for the incursion itself was minimal at best, in part to preserve the secrecy of Menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{views on}} the 2011 budget cuts and his departures from GOP {{consensus}} placed him at odds {{with some of his}} fellow Republicans and prominent Tea Party conservatives, including Glenn Beck. He said he opposed these measures because he <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would {{have a negative impact on}} low income families and children.|$|E

5|$|Hergé took up {{painting}} as a hobby, producing abstract art works which {{were influenced by}} the styles of Joan Miró and Serge Poliakoff. He showed his work to the art historian Léo Van Puyvelde, who was the chief conservator of the Musées des Beaux-Arts, who <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> showed promise but that Hergé's real talent lay with cartoon drawing. Hergé abandoned painting shortly after, having produced 37 paintings in all.|$|E
5|$|News {{of the two}} strikes, {{with the}} mistaken reports that each had sunk an American carrier, greatly {{improved}} Japanese morale. The few surviving aircraft were all recovered aboard Hiryū. Despite the heavy losses, the Japanese <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could scrape together enough aircraft for one more strike against what they {{believed to be the}} only remaining American carrier.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Peruvian Moche people worshipped {{the sea and}} its animals. Their art often depicts manta rays. Historically, mantas were {{feared for}} their size and power. Sailors <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> ate fish and could sink boats by pulling on the anchors. This {{attitude}} changed around 1978 when divers around the Gulf of California {{found them to be}} placid and that they could interact with the animals. Several divers photographed themselves with mantas, including Jaws author Peter Benchley.|$|E

25|$|Four factors {{exist that}} cause {{a person to}} be optimistically biased: their desired end state, their {{cognitive}} mechanisms, the information they have about themselves versus others, and overall mood. The optimistic bias is seen {{in a number of}} situations. For example: people <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are less at risk of being a crime victim, smokers <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are less likely to contract lung cancer or disease than other smokers, first-time bungee jumpers <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are less at risk of an injury than other jumpers, or traders who think they are less exposed to losses in the markets.|$|R
5|$|The {{losses at}} Fort Lee and Washington placed a heavy {{toll on the}} Patriots. When they {{evacuated}} their forts, {{they were forced to}} leave behind critical supplies and munitions. Many troops had been killed or taken prisoner, and the morale of the remaining troops was low. Few <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could win the war and gain independence.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{would be}} rewarded by the Empress Anna for {{getting rid of}} the hated Apokaukos,. She, however, was so shocked and dismayed at the loss of her {{principal}} minister, that she gave Apokaukos's supporters, who were joined by the Gasmouloi, the fleet's marines, free rein to avenge their leader's death. As a result, all prisoners, some 200 in total, were massacred, even though some attempted to seek refuge in a nearby monastery.|$|E
5|$|Black drongos were {{introduced}} {{just before the}} Second World War from Taiwan to the island of Rota {{to help in the}} control of insects. It is <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> dispersed over the sea to the island of Guam in the 1950s. By 1967, they were the fourth most commonly seen birds in roadside counts on Guam and are today the most abundant bird there. Predation by and competition from black drongos have been suggested as factors in the decline of endemic bird species such as the Rota bridled white-eye and the Guam flycatcher.|$|E

5|$|Both sides {{thought that}} they had inflicted more damage than was the case. The U.S. claimed to have shot down 70 Japanese {{aircraft}}, {{even though there were}} only 42 aircraft in all. Actual Japanese losses—from all causes—in the engagement were 25 aircraft, with most of the crews of the lost aircraft not being recovered or rescued. The Japanese, for their part, mistakenly <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had heavily damaged two U.S. carriers, instead of just one. The U.S. lost six aircraft in the engagement, with most of the crews being rescued.|$|E
5|$|Cantor avoided paradoxes by {{recognizing}} {{that there are}} two types of multiplicities. In his set theory, when it is assumed that the ordinals form a set, the resulting contradiction only implies that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. On the other hand, Bertrand Russell treated all collections as sets, which leads to paradoxes. In Russell's set theory, the ordinals form a set, so the resulting contradiction implies that the theory is inconsistent. From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his set theory is inconsistent: the Burali-Forti paradox (which was just mentioned), Cantor's paradox, and Russell's paradox. Russell named paradoxes after Cesare Burali-Forti and Cantor even though neither of them <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had found paradoxes.|$|E
5|$|Côte d'Ivoire so that {{he could}} organise {{opposition}} to the Sankara regime. In 1987, Sankara was overthrown and assassinated in a coup. The coup may have had French involvement, since the Sankara regime had fallen into disfavour in France. Houphouët-Boigny was also suspected of involvement in the coup and in November, the PDCI asked the government to ban the sale of Jeune Afrique following its allegations of Houphouët-Boigny's participation. The Ivorian president would have greatly benefited from the divisions in the Burkina Faso government. He contacted Blaise Compaoré, the second-most powerful man in the regime; it is generally <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> worked in conjunction with Laurent Dona Fologo, Robert Guéï and Pierre Ouédraogo to overthrow the Sankara regime.|$|E

5|$|Enamel's {{primary mineral}} is hydroxyapatite, {{which is a}} {{crystalline}} calcium phosphate. The large amount of minerals in enamel accounts {{not only for its}} strength but also for its brittleness. Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. Unlike dentin and bone, enamel does not contain collagen. Proteins of note in the development of enamel are ameloblastins, amelogenins, enamelins and tuftelins. It is <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> aid in the development of enamel by serving as framework support, among other functions.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} repatriations, {{returned}} prisoners were generally treated with pity, suspicion and disdain by French civilians. Many <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{had only been}} allowed to return in exchange for agreeing to collaborate. Later Vichy propaganda had implied that prisoners lived in good conditions, so many civilians believed that the prisoners had suffered much less than civilians during the conflict. As veterans of the 1940 Battle of France, the prisoners were blamed for the French defeat and portrayed as cowards who had surrendered, rather than fight to the death. They were also unfavourably compared with other men of their generation who {{had served in the}} Free French Forces or Resistance.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} {{blockade}} or bottle up the Russian squadron at Port Arthur by sinking blockships in the harbor's channel, the Japanese under Admiral Togo formulated a new plan. Ships were to mine the entrance from {{the harbor and}} then lure the Russians into the minefield {{in the hopes of}} sinking a number of Russian warships. Under cover of four detachments of torpedo boat destroyers, the minelayer Koru-Maru began to lay mines near the entrance to Port Arthur on the night of 31 March. The Japanese were observed by Admiral Makarov, who <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were Russian destroyers whom he had ordered to patrol that area.|$|E

5|$|In mid-June 1941, the {{division}} received new orders to relocate. The 16th Panzer Division crossed the German–Polish border at Groß Wartenberg heading for Ożarów at the Vistula, which was reached on 19 June 1941. The German soldiers initially <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were just going}} to transit through Russia, {{on their way to the}} Middle East where they would link up with Erwin Rommel's Afrika Corps. But Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Walther von Reichenau, who visited his son, a Leutnant in the 4th company of Panzer-Regiment 2, revealed to them the true objective of the next campaign. It would be Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{that another}} {{rejection}} {{would not be}} politically feasible, opponents of reform decided to use amendments to change the bill's essential character; for example, they voted to delay consideration of clauses in the bill that disfranchised the rotten boroughs. The ministers <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were left with only one alternative: to create {{a large number of}} new peerages, swamping the House of Lords with pro-reform votes. But the prerogative of creating peerages rested with the king, who recoiled from so drastic a step and rejected the unanimous advice of his cabinet. Lord Grey then resigned, and the king invited the Duke of Wellington to form a new government.|$|E
5|$|The Apollo 14 {{crew members}} sampled {{boulders}} in the ejecta of Cone crater. These boulders {{appeared to be}} layered and fractured breccias, contrasting from {{the appearance of the}} surrounding area because of their older age. As these boulders increase in size and number closer to Cone crater, it is <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> originate from the greatest depth of excavation of Cone crater. These boulders show what is believed to be general characteristics of the Fra Mauro formation: clastic texture, stratification, and jointing or fracturing.|$|E
