5|$|Anti-Earp {{writers and}} {{researchers}} use Frank Waters' Earp Brothers of Tombstone, {{as their primary}} source for material that presents Wyatt Earp {{as something of a}} villainous monster, aided and abetted by his brothers who were almost brutes. Waters detested the Earps so badly that he presented a book that was terribly flawed, poorly edited, and <b>brimming</b> <b>with</b> prevarications. In his other work, Waters is poetic. In the Earp Brothers of Tombstone, he {{is little more than a}} tabloid hack, trying to slander someone he dislikes. To date, no reason has been uncovered for the bias Frank Waters exhibited against Wyatt Earp and his brothers.|$|E

Like any conspiracy theory, it contains several grains of truth; and like any such theory, it is both irrational and insidious.|$|E

25|$|Arnold's Wildcats were {{a highly}} {{successful}} team, as they finished the regular season as minor premiers with a 22–4 record. After another successful regular season, the Wildcats entered the finals <b>brimming</b> <b>with</b> confidence. The Wildcats easily accounted for long-term rivals the Adelaide 36ers in the Semi Finals to then find themselves against the highly-rated Eastside Spectres in the Grand Final. The Wildcats had {{a unique opportunity to}} win back-to-back titles, a feat only achieved by two other teams to that point {{in the history of the}} NBL. Everything looked on track when the Wildcats were able to defeat the Spectres in Game 1 in Melbourne by 26 points (109–83). Perth had hit fever pitch and another sold-out crowd awaited the Wildcats for Game 2 back at home. However, with their backs against the wall, the Spectres performed with a never-say-die attitude and upset the favourites at home by five points (86–81). Game 2 was played on a Friday night and Game 3 was scheduled for Sunday, leaving the Wildcats little time to formulate a new strategy. However, in front of an electric Perth crowd, the Wildcats were victorious in the deciding third game by 10 points (90–80) and became the third team in history to win back-to-back NBL Championships. Hansen was named MVP of the Grand Final series after averaging 17.3 points per game over the three games.|$|E
25|$|Sambhāvanā (Hindi: सम्भावना, meaning Competency): Sambhāvanā or {{competency}} is vividly {{described in}} the first ten verses of the canto. Aṣṭāvakra is <b>brimming</b> <b>with</b> confidence as he approaches Mithilā. Mithilā is replete with scholars versed in the Vedas and all the six Āstika schools. The twelve-year olds Aṣṭāvakra and Śvetaketu run into Janaka, who {{is on his way}} to the court. Janaka asks his guards to get the handicapped boy out of his way. Aṣṭāvakra responds by saying that Janaka should get out of his way instead, as he (Aṣṭāvakra) is a Brāhmaṇa versed in the scriptures. Pleased with his brilliance, Janaka tells Aṣṭāvakra that he is free to roam anywhere in Mithilā. However, Janaka's gatekeeper does not let Aṣṭāvakra into the court, and tells him that only the learned and wise elders deserve to be in Janaka's court. Aṣṭāvakra makes the gatekeeper speechless by his definition of elders – only those grown in knowledge are the elders. The gatekeeper now lets him into an assembly consisting of sages like Yājñavalkya, Gārgī and Maitreyī. Aṣṭāvakra openly challenges Bandī for a scriptural debate. Janaka asks Aṣṭāvakra to satisfy him first in debate, and poses him six cryptic questions, which Aṣṭāvakra answers convincingly. Janaka offers him Bandī, who knows within himself he will lose to Aṣṭāvakra, but decides to openly debate. Bandī mocks Aṣṭāvakra's deformities and the assembly laughs. Aṣṭāvakra chides both Bandī and the assembly and declares his intention to leave the assembly.|$|E

500|$|Countdown to Extinction {{received}} generally {{positive reaction}} from critics.

AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey said that [...] "Megadeth guns for arena thrash success and gets it on Countdown to Extinction". However, Huey noted the simplification of Megadeth's sound on the album in response to Metallica's commercially successful self-titled album released the previous year. Sputnikmusic reviewer Mike Stagno praised Mustaine's vocals {{as well as a}} number of the album's tracks. Despite calling this effort [...] "Megadeth's first step into the world of mainstream music", he also noted that [...] "the band still maintains its identity". Reflex described the sound as [...] "impressively clean, streamlined, and sharp, <b>brimming</b> <b>with</b> killing riffs".

[...] "Secrets" [...] was, appropriately, {{the theme of the}} album; the album also explored strong female figures, love, and sadness; songs depicted the artist's struggles and were written to encourage women. Although Secret was originally intended to be a mini-album, Hamasaki [...] "began <b>brimming</b> <b>with</b> things to say" [...] while producing the album and wrote five more songs. The album consisted mostly of rock songs and ballads; to complement these, Hamasaki experimented with new vocal techniques. The album also topped the Oricon weekly charts, making Hamasaki the only artist to have eight consecutive number-one studio albums. Her sales, however, continued to decline: according to both Oricon and the RIAJ, Secret failed to sell a million copies.|$|E

[...] According to The Huffington Posts Mike Ragogna, while the music covered styles ranging from pop and quiet storm to [...] "light" [...] avant-garde, the subject matter had a [...] "low key/high concept" [...] quality expressed through terse lyrics, sonic experiments, and character studies such as [...] "Lola" [...] and [...] "White Girl".|$|E

500|$|American rapper Azealia Banks has {{recorded}} songs for one studio album, one extended play (EP) and two mixtapes, {{as well as}} various other releases and guest appearances.

500|$|The {{writing and}} {{formation}} of By the Way began {{immediately following the}} culmination of Californication's world tour, {{in the spring of}} 2001. As with Californication, much of the creation took place in the band members' homes and other practice locations, such as a recording studio stage. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "We started finding some magic and some music and some riffs and some rhythms and some jams and some grooves, and we added to it and subtracted from it and pushed it around and put melodies to it." [...] Frusciante and Kiedis would collaborate for days straight, discussing guitar progressions and sharing lyrics. For Kiedis, [...] "writing By the Way...was a whole different experience from Californication. John was back to himself and <b>brimming</b> <b>with</b> confidence." [...] Prior to recording By the Way, the Chili Peppers decided that they would again have Rick Rubin produce the album. Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought essential for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return.|$|E

He also felt that Odenkirk's performance was humorous, but dragged on too long and played the joke too far. Adams, however, was complimentary towards Angela and Dwight's subplot, calling it the most [...] "daring" [...] of the episode's various subplots, and saying it provided momentum for the episode. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode [...] "unpleasant', largely due to Andy's presence; he felt that the character [...] "continues to dominate the action and crush all the goodwill generated earlier in the season". However, he was very pleased with Odenkirk's performance, calling his acting [...] "a pretty spot-on recreation of the early years [...] ". Bob Odenkirk's performance was later submitted by the producers of The Office for an [...] "Outstanding Guest Actor in Comedy Series" [...] Emmy consideration.|$|E
