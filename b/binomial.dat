5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{indication}} of a naming error, Engelmann's <b>binomial</b> was {{used to describe the}} plant until 1893, when F.A. Haage Jr. changed Terscheck's Echinocactus reichenbachii to Echinocereus reichenbachii, which Nathaniel Lord Britton and Joseph Nelson Rose later adopted. This broke with the long-standing botanical tradition to use the earliest known name, but because Terscheck's description was lacking and possibly referred to as many as a dozen species, his <b>binomial</b> was supplanted by Haage's.|$|E
5|$|Homarus gammarus {{was first}} given a <b>binomial</b> name by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae, {{published}} in 1758. That name was Cancer gammarus, since Linnaeus' concept of the genus Cancer at that time included all large crustaceans.|$|E
5|$|If the {{variance}} in the number of offspring is much greater than that given by the <b>binomial</b> distribution assumed by the Wright–Fisher model, then given the same overall speed of genetic drift ({{the variance}} effective population size), genetic drift is a less powerful force compared to selection. Even for the same variance, if higher moments of the offspring number distribution exceed those of the <b>binomial</b> distribution then again the force of genetic drift is substantially weakened.|$|E

40|$|Let V be an affine toric {{variety of}} codimension r over {{a field of}} any characteristic. We {{completely}} characterize the affine toric varieties that are set-theoretic complete intersections on <b>binomials.</b> In particular we prove that in the characteristic zero case, V is a set-theoretic complete intersection on <b>binomials</b> {{if and only if}} V is a complete intersection. Moreover, if F 1, [...] ., Fr are <b>binomials</b> such that I(V) = rad(F 1, [...] ., Fr), then I(V) = (F 1, [...] ., Fr). While in the positive characteristic p case, V is a set-theoretic complete intersection on <b>binomials</b> if and only if V is completely p-glued. These results improve and complete all known results on these topics...|$|R

5|$|The {{establishment}} of universally accepted conventions for {{the naming of}} organisms was Linnaeus' main contribution to taxonomy—his work marks {{the starting point of}} consistent use of <b>binomial</b> nomenclature. During the 18th century expansion of natural history knowledge, Linnaeus also developed {{what became known as the}} Linnaean taxonomy; the system of scientific classification now widely used in the biological sciences. A previous zoologist Rumphius (1627–1702) had more or less approximated the Linnaean system and his material contributed to the later development of the <b>binomial</b> scientific classification by Linnaeus.|$|E
40|$|International audienceBinomials, as {{all other}} types of phraseological units in English, {{are more or less}} fixed and {{therefore}} subject to a certain degree of variation. Non-compositional <b>binomials</b> are usually varied by replacing one of the constituent parts by another lexeme which changes the mental representation of the metaphor involved. Prosodic devices are responsible as well for the creation and variation of non-compositional <b>binomials.</b> However, we claim that the lexicalisation of certain <b>binomials</b> is the result of their functioning autonomously in discourse outside their traditional collocational frameworks. Well-established nominal or verbal <b>binomials</b> can thus attain a higher degree of non-compositionality thanks to their discoursal instantiations as attributive adjectives. It should be noted that conceptual blending accounts mainly for the creation of nonce formations, purely for stylistic purposes...|$|R

5|$|Buckland had not {{provided}} a specific name, as {{was not uncommon}} {{in the early nineteenth}} century, when the genus was still seen as the more essential concept. In 1826, Ferdinand von Ritgen gave this dinosaur a complete <b>binomial,</b> Megalosaurus conybeari, which however was not much used by later authors and is now considered a nomen oblitum. A year later, in 1827, Gideon Mantell included Megalosaurus in his geological survey of southeastern England, and assigned the species its current valid <b>binomial</b> name, Megalosaurus bucklandii. Until recently, the form Megalosaurus bucklandi was often used, a variant first published in 1832 by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer – and sometimes erroneously ascribed to von Ritgen – but the more original M. bucklandii has priority.|$|E
40|$|<b>Binomials,</b> such as for and against, dead or alive, to {{have and}} to hold, can be broadly defined as two words {{belonging}} to the same grammatical category and linked by a semantic relationship. They are an important phraseological phenomenon present {{throughout the history of}} the English language. This volume offers a range of studies on <b>binomials,</b> their types and functions from Old English through to the present day. Searching for motivations and characteristic features of <b>binomials</b> in a particular genre or writer, the chapters engage with many linguistic levels of analysis, such as phonology or semantics, and explore the important role of translation. Drawing on philological and corpus-linguistic approaches, the authors employ qualitative and quantitative methods, setting the discussion firmly in the extra-linguistic context. <b>Binomials</b> and their extended forms - multinomials - emerge from these discussions as an important phraseological tool, with rich applications and complex motivations...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} of synonymy, incorrect species author citation/abbreviation and spelling errors are hampering botanical research around the globe. This article was aimed {{to quantify the}} intensity and errors encountered in this regard in published botanical articles pertaining to the Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. To address this issue, 100 articles published in 1999 - 2015 were reviewed. A total of 5460 entries were processed carefully and 1350 species <b>binomials</b> (excluding repititions) were extracted that were linked with 1333 accepted <b>binomials</b> according to theplantlist. org. Out of these accepted species <b>binomials,</b> 1109 were communicated correctly, whereas the remaining 224 <b>binomials</b> were conveyed {{in the form of}} 241 synonyms. Average synonyms to accepted <b>binomials</b> ratio for the said timespan was calculated quite high as 13. 99 %. By taking these conveyed synonyms as our sub sample, we further detected 712 errors related to orthography, author citations and abbreviations. A strong positive and significant Pearson correlation was observed amongst the number of articles published, total numbers of species <b>binomials</b> communicated and the number of synonyms conveyed. These taxonomic errors and nomenclatural issues in botanical articles are causing ambiguity and confusions, thus reducing the reliability and reproducibility of botanical researches. Our results prove modest basic taxonomic skills of authors, dwindling taxonomic understanding and non-updating of regional floras on a periodic basis as primary reasons. We briefly discuss this global issue and its consequences and also document numerous suggestions to mitigate the impacts...|$|R

5|$|Carl Linnaeus, {{the founder}} of modern <b>binomial</b> nomenclature, gave lemurs their name as early as 1758, when he used it in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae. He {{included}} three species under the genus Lemur: Lemur tardigradus (the red slender loris, now known as Loris tardigradus), Lemur catta (the ring-tailed lemur), and Lemur volans (the Philippine colugo, now known as Cynocephalus volans).|$|E
5|$|It was the Swedish {{botanist}} Carl Linnaeus {{who finally}} put order into this situation as {{he attempted to}} name all the known organisms of his day. In 1735 his Systema Naturae, which included animals (the tenth edition became {{the starting point for}} zoological nomenclature) was followed by Critica Botanica in 1737, and Philosophia Botanica in 1751. But it was his most comprehensive work on plants, the 1753 publication Species Plantarum that formalised the name of a genus with a single epithet to form the name of a species as two words, the <b>binomial</b> thus making secure the biological system of <b>binomial</b> nomenclature. In these works Linnaeus used a third name as a variety within a species. These varieties included both wild and horticultural variants.

5|$|Swedish {{zoologist}} Carl Linnaeus {{first described}} the genus Elephas and an elephant from Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) under the <b>binomial</b> Elephas maximus in 1758. In 1798, Georges Cuvier classified the Indian elephant under the <b>binomial</b> Elephas indicus. Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck described the Sumatran elephant in 1847 under the <b>binomial</b> Elephas sumatranus. English zoologist Frederick Nutter Chasen classified all three as subspecies of the Asian elephant in 1940. Asian elephants vary geographically in their colour {{and amount of}} depigmentation. The Sri Lankan elephant (Elephas maximus maximus) inhabits Sri Lanka, the Indian elephant (E.m.indicus) is native to mainland Asia (on the Indian subcontinent and Indochina), and the Sumatran elephant (E.m.sumatranus) is found in Sumatra. One disputed subspecies, the Borneo elephant, lives in northern Borneo and is smaller {{than all the other}} subspecies. It has larger ears, a longer tail, and straighter tusks than the typical elephant. Sri Lankan zoologist Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala described it in 1950 under the trinomial Elephas maximus borneensis, taking as his type an illustration in National Geographic. It was subsequently subsumed under either E.m.indicus or E.m.sumatranus. Results of a 2003 genetic analysis indicate its ancestors separated from the mainland population about 300,000years ago. A 2008 study found that Borneo elephants are not indigenous to the island but were brought there before 1521 by the Sultan of Sulu from Java, where elephants are now extinct.|$|E
