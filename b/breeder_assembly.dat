40|$|Abstract. A {{detailed}} and comprehensive programme is undertaken in India to fabricate Indian Test Blanket Module (TBM) {{to be tested}} in ITER. Development of India-specific Reduced Activation Ferritic/Martensitic (RAFM) steel has been realized through melting, processing and physical and mechanical properties characterization of several heats of 9 Cr-RAFM steel with varying tungsten and tantalum contents. The RAFM steel having 1. 4 wt. % tungsten and 0. 06 wt. % tantalum is found to possess better combination of strength and toughness and is considered as India-specific RAFM steel. Different joining processes for fabrication of TBM have been assessed. Hot Iso-static Pressing (HIP) has been developed that {{would be useful to}} fabricate the first wall of TBM. To avoid channel collapse during HIPing, leachable ceramic cores were inserted in the channels. Electron Beam (EB) and Laser Welding processes are used for fabrication of breeder cassettes and hence, these welding procedures have been developed. Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG), Narrow Gap TIG (NG-TIG) and Laser-Hybrid welding processes are being considered for integration of the various components such as first wall, back plate, bottom plate, <b>breeder</b> <b>assembly</b> and flow dividers into TBM. RAFM steel welding consumables have also been developed and qualified. Procedure for laser-hybrid weldin...|$|E

40|$|The TRIO {{experiment}} {{is a test}} of in-situ tritium recovery and heat transfer performance of a miniaturized solid <b>breeder</b> blanket <b>assembly.</b> The assembly (capsule) was monitored for temperature and neutron flux profiles during irradiation and a sweep gas flowed through the capsule to an analytical train wherein the amounts of tritium in its various chemical forms were determined. The capsule was designed to operate at different temperatures and sweep gas conditions. At {{the end of the}} experiment the amount of tritium retained in the solid was at a concentration of less than 0. 1 wppM. More than 99. 9 % of tritium generated during the experiment was successfully recovered. The results of the experiment showed that the tritium inventories at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the experiment follow a relationship which appears to be characteristic of intragranular diffusion...|$|R

The hot cells can also serve as a transfer lock through the outer containment barrier, thereby permitting uninterrupted reactor operation during fuel transfer to and from the decay storage tank. 5 references (auth...|$|R
