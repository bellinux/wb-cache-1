40|$|Abstract. A spreadsheet, {{especially}} MS Excel, {{is probably}} one of the most popular software applications for personal-computer users and gives us convenient and user-friendly tools for drawing tables. In practical situations, we often wish to draw several vertical and horizontal black lines on selective gridlines to enhance the readability of our spreadsheet. Such situations we frequently encounter are formulated as the Border Drawing Problem (BDP). Given a layout of black line segments, we study how to draw it efficiently from an algorithmic view point, by using a set of <b>border</b> <b>styles</b> and investigate its complexity. (i) We first give a formal model based on MS Excel, and then (ii) show that the problem is N P-hard for the set of the Excel <b>border</b> <b>styles</b> and for any reasonable subset of the styles.

5000|$|Planning for the {{banknotes}} {{began on}} 6 February 1952 {{after the death}} of George VI and the accession of Elizabeth II to the throne. The first design, created by the Canadian Bank Note Company, was deemed too similar in style to the 1937 Series, including the [...] "elaborate scrollwork" [...] decorating the edges of the banknotes. To reflect a [...] "growing sense of Canadian nationalism", the design of the banknotes was significantly {{different from that of the}} 1937 Series, retaining the bilingual text and denomination colours using a modern 1950s style that abandoned Victorian ornamentation associated with Canada's colonial past. The banknotes were marked with English text to the left of the French text. The less ornate design and arrangement of elements was said to improve the legibility of the banknotes. The banknotes featured the same <b>border</b> <b>style</b> on the obverse and reverse.|$|E
5000|$|Other dances {{listed by}} Bacon include Border Morris dances from Brimfield, Bromsberrow Heath, Evesham, Leominster, Much Wenlock, Pershore, Upton-upon-Severn, Upton Snodsbury, White Ladies Aston, and {{miscellaneous}} non-Cotswold, non-Border dances from Steeple Claydon and Winster. There {{are a number}} of traditions which have been collected since the mid-twentieth century, though few have been widely adopted. Examples are Broadwood, Duns Tew, and Ousington-under-Wash in the Cotswold style, and Upper and Lower Penn in the <b>Border</b> <b>style.</b> In fact, for many of the [...] "collected" [...] traditions in Bacon, only sketchy information is available about the way they were danced in the nineteenth century, and they have been reconstructed to a degree that makes them largely twentieth century inventions as well. Some traditions have been reconstructed in several strikingly disparate ways; an example would be Adderbury, danced very differently by the Adderbury Morris Men and the Adderbury Village Morris.|$|E
