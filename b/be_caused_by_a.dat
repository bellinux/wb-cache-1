5|$|In 1906, {{transmission}} by the Aedes mosquitoes was confirmed, and in 1907 dengue was {{the second}} disease (after yellow fever) that was shown to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> virus. Further investigations by John Burton Cleland and Joseph Franklin Siler completed the basic understanding of dengue transmission.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{condition}} is otitis externa (outer ear infections), which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E
5|$|Asthma {{is thought}} to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.|$|E

5000|$|Hypergammaglobulinemia is {{characterized}} by increased levels of immunoglobulins in the blood serum. Five different hypergammaglobulinemias <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> excess of immunoglobulin M (IgM), and some types <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> deficiency in the other major types of immunoglobulins.|$|R
5000|$|On June 17, 1922, 18-year-old Dorothy MacLatchie {{was killed}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> [...] "monster fish" [...] while {{floating}} {{next to the}} Municipal Pier in St. Petersburg, Florida. While some reports indicate her death <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> shark, newspaper accounts indicate her death <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> barracuda.|$|R
5|$|Croup can <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} viruses {{including}} parainfluenza and influenza virus. Rarely is it {{due to a}} bacterial infection. Croup is typically diagnosed based on signs and symptoms after potentially more severe causes, such as epiglottitis or an airway foreign body, have been ruled out. Further investigations—such as blood tests, X-rays, and cultures—are usually not needed.|$|E
5|$|Eta Apodis {{is a white}} main {{sequence}} star located 138 ± 1 light-years distant. Of apparent magnitude 4.89, it is 1.77 times as massive, 15.5 times as luminous as the Sun and has 2.13 times its radius. Aged 250 ± 200 million years old, this star is emitting an excess of 24μm infrared radiation, which may <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> debris disk of dust orbiting {{at a distance of}} more than 31 astronomical units from it.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 it was {{hypothesized}} that these clumps could <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> roughly Neptune-mass planet having migrated from 40 to 65AU over 56millionyears, an orbit large enough to allow the formation of smaller rocky planets closer to Vega. The migration of this planet would likely require gravitational interaction with a second, higher-mass planet in a smaller orbit.|$|E
5000|$|In the IS-LM model (investment {{and saving}} {{equilibrium}} liquidity preference and money supply equilibrium model), deflation <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{shift in the}} supply and demand curve for goods and services. This in turn can <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> increase in supply, a fall in demand, or both.|$|R
25|$|The dbtL {{mutation}} {{causes the}} period of PER and TIM oscillations, as well as animal behavioral activity, to lengthen to about 27 hours. This extended rhythm <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> decreased rate of phosphorylation of PER due to lower DBT kinase activity levels. This mutation <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> substitution in the protein sequence (Met-80→Ile mutation). The dbtS mutation causes a PER/TIM oscillation period of 18–20 hours. There is no current evidence for the mechanism affected by the mutation, but it <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> substitution in the protein sequence (Pro-47→ Ser mutation).|$|R

5|$|Many {{different}} mammalian {{species can}} be affected by prion diseases, as the prion protein (PrP) is very similar in all mammals. Due to small differences in PrP between different species it is unusual for a prion disease to transmit from one species to another. The human prion disease variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, however, is believed to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> prion that typically infects cattle, causing Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and is transmitted through infected meat.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is thought to}} <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> mutation in a gene on the X chromosome. A 2007 study concluded, based on analysis of microsatellite markers (small gene sequences found in common among individuals having the same ethnicity, ancestry or genetic disease) of the family described by Keipert, that this gene was likely located on the long arm of the X chromosome between positions Xq22.2q28. This is not definitive, however, and no specific gene has been named.|$|E

50|$|FOP <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> {{autosomal}} dominant allele on chromosome 2q23-24. The allele has variable expressivity, but complete penetrance. Most cases <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> spontaneous mutation in the gametes; {{most people with}} FOP cannot or choose not to have children. A similar but less catastrophic disease is fibrous dysplasia, which <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> post-zygotic mutation.|$|R
5|$|The {{value of}} eating a certain food to {{maintain}} health was recognized long before vitamins were identified. The ancient Egyptians knew that feeding liver {{to a person}} may help with night blindness, an illness now known to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> vitamin A deficiency. The advancement of ocean voyages during the Renaissance resulted in prolonged periods without access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and made illnesses from vitamin deficiency common among ships' crews.|$|E
5|$|WASP-13b is an {{extrasolar planet}} that was {{discovered}} in 2008 in the orbit of the sunlike star WASP-13. The planet has a mass of nearly half that of Jupiter, but a radius five-fourths the size of Jupiter. This low relative mass might <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> core that is of low mass or that is not present at all.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} found with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{can be managed}} or treated. Sensorineural hearing loss in humans may <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> loss of hair cells (sensory receptors in the inner ear {{that are associated with}} hearing). This can be hereditary and/or within a syndrome, {{as is the case with}} nasodigitoacoustic syndrome, or attributed to infections such as viruses. For the management of sensorineural hearing loss, hearing aids have been used. Treatments, depending upon the cause and severity, may include a pharmacological approach (i.e., the use of certain steroids), or surgical intervention, like a cochlear implant.|$|E

5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation of the ear canal which can <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E
5|$|In June and July 2002, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma {{sponsored}} the first National Intercollegiate Marching Band, which {{traveled to the}} French Riviera, including the cities of Nice, Grasse, Aix-en-Provence, Cannes, Antibes, and the Principality of Monaco. The thirty-five member band performed at Le Suquet in Cannes, in Nice, {{and in front of}} the Prince's Palace of Monaco. After the inaugural trip, the program was dissolved by the joint national councils due to its high cost and low attendance, which was believed to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> fear of traveling abroad after the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} {{is not a}} {{specific}} disease but rather a complaint that may <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large number of underlying problems of varying levels of seriousness. The majority of LBP {{does not have a}} clear cause but {{is believed to be the}} result of non-serious muscle or skeletal issues such as sprains or strains. Obesity, smoking, weight gain during pregnancy, stress, poor physical condition, poor posture and poor sleeping position may also contribute to low back pain. A full list of possible causes includes many less common conditions. Physical causes may include osteoarthritis, degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae or a spinal disc herniation, broken vertebra(e) (such as from osteoporosis) or, rarely, an infection or tumor of the spine.|$|E

50|$|Ehlers-Danlos {{syndrome}} - Six {{different types}} of this disorder, which lead to deformities in connective tissue, are known. Some types can be lethal, leading to the rupture of arteries. Each syndrome <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> different mutation, for example type four of this disorder <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> mutation in collagen type 3.|$|R
50|$|An {{electrochemical}} gradient has two components. First, {{the electrical}} component <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> charge difference across the lipid membrane. Second, <b>a</b> chemical component <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> differential concentration of ions across the membrane. The {{combination of these}} two factors determines the thermodynamically favourable direction for an ion's movement across a membrane.|$|R
5|$|The {{high levels}} of chromospheric activity, strong {{magnetic}} field, and relatively fast rotation rate of Epsilon Eridani are characteristic of a young star. Most estimates {{of the age of}} Epsilon Eridani place it in the range from 200 million to 800 million years. The low abundance of heavy elements in the chromosphere of Epsilon Eridani usually indicates an older star, because the interstellar medium (out of which stars form) is steadily enriched by heavier elements produced by older generations of stars. This anomaly might <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> diffusion process that has transported some of the heavier elements out of the photosphere and into a region below Epsilon Eridani's convection zone.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of planetary mass companions around PSR B1257+12 in 1990 by Aleksander Wolszczan, data for PSR B1937+21 and other pulsars were analyzed {{for the presence of}} similar companions. By 1994, an upper limit of about one thousandth of the mass of Earth was determined for any companion of PSR B1937+21 within 2 astronomical units. In 1999, Aleksander Wolszczan reported variations in the times of arrival of pulses from PSR B1937+21, as well as previous analysis by Tokio Fukushima which suggested that these timing variations could <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> dwarf planet around the pulsar. The data were consistent with a companion having a mass similar to Ceres and located at 2.71 astronomical units from the pulsar, but data {{over a longer period of}} time are required in order to verify the proposed companion. More recent observations have not detected any regular periodic signal associated with this companion, but argue that the slight variations in pulse arrival times are consistent with an asteroid belt having a total mass less than 0.05 that of the Earth, but acknowledge that the detection of periodicity in pulse timing variations associated with individual asteroids is necessary to confirm the possible asteroid belt.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{with other}} waves, moving into shallow water causes the tsunami to slow but grow in height. Either the trough or {{the crest of the}} tsunami can arrive at the coast first. In the former case, the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas unusually exposed. When the crest arrives, it does not usually break but rushes inland, {{flooding}} all in its path. Much of the disaster's destruction can be produced by these flood waters, which drain back into the sea while pulling people and debris along. Several tsunamis can <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single geological event. In such cases, it is common for the later waves to arrive between eight minutes and two hours after the first, which may not be the biggest or most destructive. Occasionally, in a shallow bay or estuary, a tsunami may transform into a bore.|$|E
