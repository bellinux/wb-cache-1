40|$|Motherhood {{represents}} a status that has substantial cultural meaning. The {{ways in which}} people think about motherhood, however, tend {{to be limited to}} biology. Among partnered or married women, this study seeks to compare variations in motherhood by recognizing women as <b>biological</b> <b>mothers,</b> stepmothers, and double mothers. Double mothers are a previously unexamined category of motherhood that refers to women who are both biological and stepmothers. Using the National Survey of Fertility Barriers, I assess potential differences in life satisfaction and psychological distress across these three mother statuses and two types of non-mothers (voluntary childfree and involuntary childless women). Factors that moderate (i. e., importance of motherhood) or mediate (i. e., self-esteem, social support, relationship satisfaction, and job status and satisfaction) well-being across mother status are also explored. Results indicate that <b>biological</b> <b>mothers</b> have significantly higher life satisfaction than all other mother statuses. Additionally, double mothers have significantly more psychological distress compared to <b>biological</b> <b>mothers</b> and both groups of non-mothers. Importance of motherhood, however, significantly moderated well-being across mother statuses. Specifically, life satisfaction does not significantly vary across mother status when importance of motherhood is low, and there are no differences in psychological distress between <b>biological</b> <b>mothers</b> and involuntary childless women when the importance of motherhood is high. Moreover, self-esteem, relationship satisfaction, job satisfaction, and importance of motherhood mediated well-being across mother status. First, differences in life satisfaction between stepmothers and <b>biological</b> <b>mothers</b> are explained by <b>biological</b> <b>mothers</b> 2 ̆ 7 higher self-esteem and importance of motherhood. Second, differences in life satisfaction between <b>biological</b> <b>mothers</b> and involuntary childless women are explained by <b>biological</b> <b>mothers</b> 2 ̆ 7 higher self-esteem, job satisfaction, and importance of motherhood. Finally, differences in psychological distress between double mothers and voluntary childfree women are explained by higher relationship satisfaction among voluntary childfree women. These results highlight the importance of taking multiple dimensions of motherhood and non-motherhood into account when examining differences in well-being among women. They speak to broadening cultural definitions of motherhood to be more inclusive of women 2 ̆ 7 s diverse experiences. ...|$|R

Approximately 3. 2 million {{children}} in the United States received a response from Child Protective Services (CPS) in 2012, mostly due to neglect, physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, and parental drugs (Children???s Bureau, 2013). Children???s Bureau states that of these 3. 2 {{million children}}, 86, 747 were {{less than one year}} old.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In female-bonded primate species, {{there is}} cross-generational {{consistency}} in female affiliative and aggressive behavior. This consistency {{could be the}} result of maternal effects, offspring learning, shared environment, and/or direct genetic inheritance of behavioral or psychological traits. In this study, I inves-tigated possible similarities in affiliation and aggression between cross-fostered rhesus macaque females and their <b>biological</b> <b>mothers.</b> Ten female infants were cross-fostered at birth, and selected aspects of their affiliative and agonistic behavior over the course of their first 3 years of life were compared to the behavior of their foster and <b>biological</b> <b>mothers.</b> Average offspring rates of social contact and aggression across the 3 years, and in particular in Years 2 and 3, resembled those of their <b>biological</b> <b>mothers</b> whereas no clear behavioral similarities between offspring and foster mothers were observed at any age. Heritable variation in female social behavior may be maintained by natural selection and leads to adaptation to different socioecological niches within macaque populations...|$|R
5|$|Parents can {{be either}} the <b>{{biological}}</b> <b>mother</b> or biological father, or the legal guardian for adopted children. Traditionally, mothers were responsible for raising the kids while the father was out providing financially for the family. The age group for parents ranges from teenage parents to grandparents who have decided to raise their grandchildren, with teenage pregnancies fluctuating based on race and culture. Older parents are financially established and generally have fewer problems raising children compared to their teenage counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the <b>biological</b> <b>mother.</b> Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E
5|$|Family {{issues were}} {{significant}} concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, {{even though the}} general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the <b>biological</b> <b>mother.</b> Several studies performed {{as a result of}} custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children who grow up with lesbian mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.|$|E

Findings suggest that mothers and fathers, regardless of whether they attended together or alone, benefited similarly from participating in the intervention.

This study explored how young African American women with breast cancer and their <b>biological</b> <b>mothers</b> constructed their own conceptualization and solutions to breast cancer from their lived experience with the disease. A naturalistic approach was used to explore and analyze the knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes of young African American women with breast cancer and their <b>biological</b> <b>mothers.</b> Semistructured interview technique was the qualitative method used to elicit the data. The voices of 14 African American women provided rich, thick descriptive data about their knowledge, feelings, and beliefs about breast cancer and how they were treated by their families and the medical community. The findings reveal that African American mothers and daughters have a wide variety of beliefs about breast cancer that are rooted in historical, social, and cultural experiences. Stereotypes and myths continue to emerge from their beliefs. Several women commonly reported issues of distrust and disrespect in the medical community. Fear of breast cancer for African American mothers and daughters centered on not having health insurance, access to medical care, and multiple treatment options. The results of the discussions with African American daughters with breast cancer and their <b>biological</b> <b>mothers</b> revealed that informal self-directed learning was a major component used throughout their learning process to become knowledgeable about health issues, especially as they related to breasts and breast cancer...|$|R
