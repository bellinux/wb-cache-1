40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} automatic identification of <b>backlash</b> in robot transmissions. Traditionally, the <b>backlash</b> is measured manually either by the transmission manufacturer or the robot manufacturer. Before the robot can be delivered to the end-customer, the <b>backlash</b> must be within specified tolerances. For robots with motor measurements only, <b>backlash</b> {{is an example of}} an uncontrollable behaviour which directly affects the absolute accuracy of the robot’s tool-centrepoint. Even if we do not attempt to bring <b>backlash</b> under real-time control in this paper, we will describe a method to automatically identify/estimate the <b>backlash</b> in the robot transmissions from torque and position measurements. Hence, only the transmissions that do not meet the <b>backlash</b> requirements in the automatic tests need to be checked and adjusted manually...|$|R

Titled Pentru ce s-au răsculat țăranii? ("Why Did the Peasants Rebel?"), it argued that the uprising marked a reaction against the latifundia and tenancies.

As he noted, peasants being forced to pay for fodder and informally pressured or terrorized into reimbursing corvées, and often reduced to lassitude and alcoholism.

2500|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1954, Dien Bien Phu alone required 20 C-119s and 50 C-47s, so, on January 2, Navarre’s second-in-command asked for additional aircraft and crews under the so-called “Navarre Plan.” U.S. President Eisenhower, fearing both domestic and international <b>backlashes</b> {{if he were to}} send in U.S. troops, sent an American mission to Indochina {{to determine the extent of}} help that the French needed. Following a personal letter from the French prime minister, Joseph Laniel, Eisenhower authorized the loan of aircraft with French markings painted on them and flown by crews from Civil Air Transport (CAT), a commercial airline, which had been started in 1946 by then-retired Major General Chennault, the famous commander of the American Volunteer Group (AVG), better known as the “Flying Tigers”, in China during World War II, and then purchased by the CIA in the year war broke out in Korea. He further authorized the dispatch of American “specialists” to Indochina, that is, mechanics from the Far East Air Force (FEAF) of the USAF. Once sworn to secrecy owing to the political ramifications of their presence, they would go to work on B-26s at Da Nang (then called Tourane) in the south and on C-47s at Do Son, located south of Haiphong, in the north, respectively. (In fact, Eisenhower was so concerned about their presence, which itself caused the Chinese government to label the American mechanics as “combatants”, that he told U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that he wanted them withdrawn by the end of June 1954 no matter what the situation in Indochina was at that time.) ...|$|E

40|$|Sponsoring {{organization}} Title and subtitle Testing {{and implementation}} of a <b>backlash</b> detection algorithm. (Test och implementering av en glappdetekteringsmetod) <b>Backlash</b> is a well documented and rather common non-linearity which is present in most mechanical and hydraulic systems. The amount of <b>backlash</b> varies depending on {{the dynamics of the}} system, for example a gear box in a car needs some space for heat expansion and consequently some amount of <b>backlash</b> in order to function. It is of interest to detect and estimate the amount of <b>backlash</b> automatically, since the time between the manual inspections often is long. This thesis covers the method described in “Automatic on-line estimation of <b>backlash</b> in control loops ” written by Tore Hägglund and published in the Journal of Process Control in January 2007. One of the main objectives of this master thesis is to extend the safety net to guarantee the robustness of the <b>backlash</b> estimation procedure described in the article. The purpose of the safety net {{is to make sure that}} <b>backlash</b> estimates are only calculated when the system behavior resembles <b>backlash.</b> Conditions for period time, curve form and setpoint are discussed and investigated. The <b>backlash</b> estimation procedure is implemented as a control module in a prototype library in ABB Control Builder, a software used for PLC programming in an ABB 800 xA environment. Finally, industrial field tests are performed to confirm the robustness of the method...|$|R
40|$|In {{automotive}} powertrains, <b>backlash</b> causes {{problems with}} vehicle driveability, specifically at so called tip-in and tip-out maneuvers. These maneuvers may trigger phenomena {{known in the}} automotive industry as shunt and shuffle, which are partially caused by the <b>backlash.</b> These phenomena are considered difficult to cope with, and until recently, only relatively simple controllers {{have been used to}} reduce the discomfort. Also, the tuning of these controllers is made quite subjectively. A number of approaches to the control of systems with <b>backlash</b> are reported in the literature. Most of these approaches assume another system structure around the <b>backlash</b> than what is the case in automotive powertrains. Very few approaches are therefore directly applicable to the control of automotive powertrains. The first part of this thesis gives an overview of available control strategies for <b>backlash</b> control. The strategies can be divided into active and passive strategies, depending on the way the controller handles the <b>backlash.</b> An active controller compensates the <b>backlash</b> nonlinearity by a more active control signal, while the passive controller becomes more cautious when the <b>backlash</b> gap is entered. Some of the strategies, e. g. switched linear controllers and model predictive controllers, are evaluated in the powertrain application by means of simulation. The results show that active nonlinear controllers have a potential for improved <b>backlash</b> control. However, the robustness of these controllers needs further investigation. Open-loop optimal control is used in this thesis as a way to find theoretical limits on <b>backlash</b> compensation performance. High-performance controllers for <b>backlash</b> compensation require high-quality measurements of {{the current state of the}} powertrain. Information about the size of the <b>backlash</b> is also needed. These problems are addressed in the second part of this thesis. Two nonlinear estimators based on Kalman filtering theory have been developed, one for state estimation and one for the estimation of <b>backlash</b> size. Simulation and experimental results show that the resulting estimates are of high quality...|$|R
