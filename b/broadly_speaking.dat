40|$|This paper {{presents}} an interest group model of gambling regulation and applies it to {{major changes in}} the regulation of U. S. gambling markets. Gam bling markets are among the most restricted and politicized markets in the American economy, yet economists interested in the economics of regulation have paid them little attention. Applying the economic theory of regulation to gambling markets can lead t o greater understanding of current public policy. In addition, this application may shed light on the discipline itself, as to its ability to explain recurrent fluctuations in the extent of regulatory intervention over long periods of time. <b>Broadly</b> <b>speak</b> ing, the interest group model is consistent with changes in the extent of regulation, including the recent period of liberalization and consequent growth in gambling...|$|R

According to Moore, [...] "Borrowing from sociologists, the term 'social location,' which <b>broadly</b> <b>speaks</b> to one's context, highlights one's standpoint(s)—the social spaces where s/he is positioned (i.e. race, class, gender, geographical, etc.) Intralocality, then, {{is concerned with}} the social locations that foreground our knowing and experiencing of our world and our relationships to the systems and people within our world. Intralocality is a call to theorize the self in relation to power and privilege, powerlessness and subjugation. It is work that requires the locating of the 'I' in the intersection.

40|$|Diabetic foot {{ulceration}} (DFU) {{is recognized}} as one of the most serious complications of diabetes. Active revascularisation plays a crucial role in achieving ulcer healing. Non-surgical, minimally invasive, revascularisation options for DFU have expanded over the last decade and have become a prominent tool to prevent amputation. Endovascular treatment of arterial DFU lesions is mainly concentrated in the below-the-knee arteries. The outcome of both open surgery and endovascular treatment is <b>broadly</b> <b>spoken</b> the same for the endpoints ulcer healing and limb salvage and is between 78 % and 85 %. The choice between endovascular treatment and open surgery should always be the outcome of a team discussion. Local expertise plays an important role in these discussions. In many institutions, the endovascular approach has currently become the first choice treatment option. The revascularisation of below-the-knee vessels needs experienced hands, team discussion and the right set of devices. Centralisation in DFU centres is therefore probably the best guaranty for the best outcome. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Lt...|$|R

Compared to other metals, PGM are expensive due to their scarcity and high production costs.|$|E
5|$|In stark {{contrast}} to the High Middle Ages, when Latin scholars focused almost entirely on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural science, philosophy and mathematics, Renaissance scholars were most interested in recovering and studying Latin and Greek literary, historical, and oratorical texts. <b>Broadly</b> <b>speaking,</b> this began in the 14th century with a Latin phase, when Renaissance scholars such as Petrarch, Coluccio Salutati (1331–1406), Niccolò de' Niccoli (1364–1437) and Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459) scoured the libraries of Europe in search of works by such Latin authors as Cicero, Lucretius, Livy and Seneca. By the early 15th century, the bulk of such Latin literature had been recovered; the Greek phase of Renaissance humanism was under way, as Western European scholars turned to recovering ancient Greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{a set of}} {{initiatives}} have been taken that complement mainstream innovation and policy networks. These initiatives are rooted in complexity based thinking and adaptive learning and are using multi-actor, multi-level and multi-sector approaches. <b>Broadly</b> <b>spoken,</b> these initiatives can be categorized in two schools: (1) the transitions approach that originated in the Netherlands (Grin et al., 2009), and (2) the change lab approach that originated in the USA (Scharmer, 2007; Senge et al., 2008; Kahane, 2010). It must be noted, however, that for instance the transitions school itself consists of various approaches and schools. I call the blend of the two approaches transition labs, as they broadly share the same characteristics and phases. More specifically, such labs consists of three phases: (1) the antecedent phase, in which preparatory work is carried out to start up the process; (2) the generative phase, in which transition experiments are invented, prototyped and learned from; and (3) the institutionalization phase, in which some experiments are up-scaled and more experiments are created and up-scaled in several new cycles. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore how various transition labs are dealing with the institutionalization or up-scaling phase, as this is the most under-researched phase given that most of these initiatives have only started at most 10 - 15 years ago and transitions typically take several decades to materialize. This exploration is based on a review of available literature, interviews with participants and personal participant observations of several transition labs in Flanders, Belgium (Plan C, Duwobo) following the transitions approach and a global change lab (the Sustainable Food Lab) following the change lab approach. status: publishe...|$|R
