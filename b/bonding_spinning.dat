40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} <b>bond</b> <b>spin</b> current, which describes the spin transport between two sites of the lattice model of a multiterminal spin-orbit (SO) coupled semiconductor nanostructure, and express {{it in terms of}} the spin-dependent nonequilibrium (Landauer-Keldysh) Green functions of the device. This formalism is applied to obtain the spatial distribution of microscopic spin currents in clean phase-coherent two-dimensional electron gas with the Rashba-type of SO coupling attached to four external leads. Together with the corresponding profiles of the stationary spin density, such visualization of the phase-coherent spin flow allow us to resolve several key issues for the understanding of mechanisms which generate pure spin Hall currents in the transverse leads of ballistic devices due to the flow of unpolarized charge current through their longitudinal leads. The local spin current profiles crucially depend on whether the sample is smaller or greater than the spin precession length, thereby demonstrating its essential role as the characteristic mesoscale for the spin Hall effect in ballistic multiterminal semiconductor nanostructures. Although static spin-independent disorder reduces the magnitude of the total spin current in the leads, the <b>bond</b> <b>spin</b> currents continue to flow through the whole diffusive 2 DEG sample, without being localized as edge spin currents around any of its boundaries.

40|$|Fermionic {{valence bond}} {{approach}} {{in terms of}} SU(4) representation is proposed to describe the J_ 1 -J_ 2 frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnetic (AF) model on a bipartite square lattice. A uniform mean field solution without breaking the translational and rotational symmetries describes a valence <b>bond</b> <b>spin</b> liquid state, interpolating the two different AF ordered states in the large J_ 1 and large J_ 2 limits, respectively. This novel spin liquid state is gapless with the vanishing density of states at the Fermi nodal points. Moreover, a sharp resonance peak in the dynamic structure factor is predicted for momenta q=(0, 0) and (π,π) in the strongly frustrated limit J_ 2 /J_ 1 ∼ 1 / 2, which can be checked by neutron scattering experiment.

40|$|Using the {{dynamical}} cluster approximation, we {{calculate the}} correlation functions {{associated with the}} nearest neighbor bond operator which measure the z component of the spin exchange in the two-dimensional Hubbard model with U equal to the bandwidth. We find that in the pseudogap region, the local bond susceptibility diverges at T= 0. This shows the existence of degenerate <b>bond</b> <b>spin</b> excitation and implies quantum criticality and bond order formation when long range correlations are considered. The strong correlation between excitations on parallel neighboring bonds suggests bond singlet dimerization. The suppression of divergence for n< ≈ 0. 78 implies that tor these model parameters this is quantum critical point which separates the unconventional pseudogap region characterized by bond order from a conventional Fermi liquid.

40|$|Three {{properties}} of the Edwards-Anderson model with mobile bonds are investigated which are characteristic of kinetic glasses. First is two-time relaxation in aged systems, where a significant difference is observed between <b>spin</b> and <b>bond</b> autocorrelation functions. The spin subsystem does not show two-time behavior, and the relaxation is stretched exponential. The bond subsystem shows two-time behavior, with the first relaxation nearly exponential and the second similar to the spin one. Second is the two-temperature behavior, which can be tuned by bond dilution through the full range reported in the literature. Third is the rigid-to-floppy transition, identified {{as a function of}} bond dilution. Simple Glauber Monte Carlo evolution without extraneous constraints reproduces the behavior of classical kinetic simulations, with the <b>bond</b> (<b>spin)</b> degree of freedom corresponding to configurational (orientational) disorder.

40|$|The underdoped {{region of}} the cuprate's phase diagram {{displays}} many novel electronic phenomena both in the normal and the superconducting state. Many of these anomalous properties have found a natural explanation within the resonating valence <b>bond</b> <b>spin</b> liquid phenomenological model of Yang-Rice-Zhang (YRZ) which includes {{the rise of a}} pseudogap. This leads to Fermi surface reconstruction and profoundly changes the electronic structure. Here we extend previous work to consider the shift in critical temperature on ^ 16 O to ^ 18 O substitution, The isotope effect has been found experimentally to be very small at optimal doping yet to rapidly increase to very large values with underdoping. The YRZ model provides a natural explanation of this behavior and supports the idea of a pairing mechanism which is mainly spin fluctuations with a subdominant (∼ 10 %) phonon contribution.

40|$|We study a slow {{relaxation}} {{process in a}} frustrated spin system in which a kind of screening effect due to frustrated environment plays an important role. This screening is attributed to highly degenerate configurations of the frustrated environment. This slow relaxation appears due to an entropy effect and is different from those due to energy barrier observed in systems such as random ferromagnets. In the present system, {{even if there is}} no energy gap, the slow relaxation still takes place. Thus, we call this phenomenon “entropic slowing down”. Here, we study mechanism of the entropic slowing down quantitatively in an Ising spin model with the so-called decorated <b>bonds.</b> The <b>spins</b> included in the decorated <b>bonds</b> (decoration <b>spins)</b> cause peculiar density of states, which causes the entropy-originated screening effect.

40|$|The {{penetration}} depth is calculated {{over the entire}} doping range of the cuprate phase diagram with emphasis on the underdoped regime. Pseudogap formation on approaching the Mott transition, for doping below a quantum critical point, is described within a model based on the resonating valence <b>bond</b> <b>spin</b> liquid which provides an ansatz for the coherent piece of the Green's function. Fermi surface reconstruction, which is {{an essential element of}} the model, has a strong effect on the superfluid density at T= 0 producing a sharp drop in magnitude, but does not change the slope of the linear low temperature variation. Comparison with recent data on Bi-based cuprates provides validation of the theory and shows that the effects of correlations, captured by Gutzwiller factors, are essential for a qualitative understanding of the data. We find that the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule still holds and we compare our results with those for the Fermi arc and the nodal liquid models. Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures, submitted to PR...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the spin {{dynamics of the}} square-lattice spin- 1 / 2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet {{by means of an}} improved mean field Schwinger boson calculation. By identifying both, the long range Néel and the RVB-like components of the ground state, we propose an educated guess for the mean field triplet excitation consisting on a linear combination of local and <b>bond</b> <b>spin</b> flips to compute the dynamical structure factor. Our main result is that when this triplet excitation is optimized {{in such a way that}} the corresponding sum rule is fulfilled, we recover the low and high energy spectral weight features of the experimental spectrum. In particular, the anomalous spectral weight depletion at (π, 0) found in recent inelastic neutron scattering experiments can be attributed to the interference of the triplet bond excitations of the RVB component of the ground state. We conclude that the Schwinger boson theory seems to be a good candidate to adequately interpret the dynamic properties of the square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet.

40|$|The phenomenological Green's {{function}} {{developed in}} the works of Yang, Rice and Zhang has been very successful in understanding many of the anomalous superconducting properties of the deeply underdoped cuprates. It is based on considerations of the resonating valence <b>bond</b> <b>spin</b> liquid approximation and is designed to describe the underdoped regime of the cuprates. Here we emphasize the region of doping, $x$, just below the quantum critical point at which the pseudogap develops. In addition to Luttinger hole pockets centered around the nodal direction, there are electron pockets near the antinodes which are connected to the hole pockets by gapped bridging contours. We determine the contours of nearest approach as would be measured in angular resolved photoemission experiments and emphasize signatures of the Fermi surface reconstruction from the large Fermi contour of Fermi liquid theory (which contains $ 1 +x$ hole states) to the Luttinger pocket (which contains $x$ hole states). We find that the quasiparticle effective mass renormalization increases strongly towards the edge of the Luttinger pockets beyond which it diverges. Comment: 11 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} of different phases of two dimensional magnetic insulators is given. The first chapters {{are devoted to}} the understanding of the symmetry breaking mechanism in the semi-classical Néel phases. Order by disorder selection is illustrated. All these phases break SU(2) symmetry and are gapless phases with ∆Sz = 1 magnon excitations. Different gapful quantum phases exist in two dimensions: the Valence Bond Crystal phases (VBC) which have long range order in local S= 0 objects (either dimers in the usual Valence Bond acception or quadrumers [...] ), but also Resonating Valence <b>Bond</b> <b>Spin</b> Liquids (RVBSL), which have no long range order in any local order parameter and an absence of susceptibility to any local probe. VBC have gapful ∆S = 0, or 1 excitations, RVBSL on the contrary have deconfined spin- 1 / 2 excitations. Examples of these two kinds of quantum phases are given in chapters 4 and 5.

40|$|Ever since Heisenberg's {{proposal}} of a quantum-mechanical origin of ferromagnetism in 1928, the spin model {{named after him}} has been central to advances in magnetism, featuring in proposals of novel many-body states such as antiferromagnets, emergent gauge fields in their confined (valence bond crystal) and deconfined (resonating valence <b>bond</b> <b>spin</b> liquids) versions. Between them, these cover much of our understanding of modern magnetism specifically and topological states of matter in general. Many exciting phenomena predicted theoretically still await experimental realisation, and cold atomic systems hold the promise of acting as analogue 'quantum simulators' of the relevant theoretical models, for which ingenious and intricate set-ups have been proposed. Here, we identify {{a new class of}} particularly simple quantum simulators exhibiting many such phenomena but obviating the need for fine-tuning and for amplifying perturbatively weak superexchange or longer-range interactions. Instead they require only moderate on-site interactions on top of uncorrelated, one-body hopping [...] ingredients already available with present experimental technology. Between them, they realise some of the most interesting phenomena, such as emergent synthetic gauge fields, resonating valence bond phases, and even the celebrated yet enigmatic spin liquid phase of the kagome lattice.

40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{the details of}} Phys. Rev. Lett. 73, 2919 (1994) and, to a lesser extent, Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 3710 (1994). We treat a Hubbard model which includes all the 3 d states of the Cu ions and the 2 p states of the O ions. We also include spin-orbit interactions, hopping between ground and excited crystal field states of the Cu ions, and rather general Coulomb interactions. Our analytic results for the spin Hamiltonian, H, are corroborated by numerical evaluations of the energy splitting of the ground manifold for two holes on either a pair of Cu ions or a Cu-O-Cu complex. In the tetragonal symmetry case and for the model considered, we prove that H is rotationally invariant {{in the absence of}} Coulomb exchange. When Coulomb exchange is present, each bond Hamiltonian has full biaxial anisotropy, as expected for this symmetry. For lower symmetry situations, the single <b>bond</b> <b>spin</b> Hamiltonian is anisotropic at order t** 6 for constant U and at order t** 2 for nonconstant U. (Constant U means that the Coulomb interaction between orbitals does not depend on which orbitals are involved.) Comment: 50 pages, ILATEX Version 2. 09 < 13 Jun 1989...|$|R
40|$|The {{resonating}} valence <b>bond</b> <b>spin</b> liquid {{model for}} the underdoped cuprates has as an essential element, {{the emergence of a}} pseudogap. This new energy scale introduces asymmetry in the quasiparticle density of states because it is associated with the antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone. By contrast, superconductivity develops on the Fermi surface and this largely restores the particle-hole symmetry for energies below the superconducting energy gap scale. In the highly underdoped regime, these two scales can be separately identified in the density of states and also partial density of states for each fixed angle in the Brillouin zone. From the total density of states, we find that the pseudogap energy scale manifests itself differently as a function of doping for positive and negative bias. Furthermore, we find evidence from recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy data for asymmetry in the positive and negative bias of the extracted Δ(θ) which is in qualitative agreement with this model. Likewise, the slope of the linear low energy density of states is nearly constant in the underdoped regime while it increases significantly with overdoping in agreement with the data.

40|$|The finite-frequency optical {{properties}} of the underdoped cuprates, in both the normal and superconducting state, display features which go beyond a Fermi liquid and a BCS description. We provide an understanding of these properties within a simplified analytical model, which has been evolved out of the Hubbard model and ideas based on a resonating valence <b>bond</b> <b>spin</b> liquid. We find that: 1) in underdoped samples, the missing area integrals reveal a second energy scale due to the pseudogap, not present at optimum or overdoping; 2) the real part of the optical self-energy shows a large sharp peak, that emerges {{with the opening of}} the pseudogap which exists within the superconducting state and persists in the normal state; and 3) the amount of optical spectral weight which is transferred to the condensate is greatly reduced by the presence of the pseudogap as compared to the Fermi liquid case. These non-BCS features of the superconducting state are in good qualitative agreement with a body of experimental work on different cuprate systems and provide strong evidence from optical conductivity that they are all a manifestation of the pseudogap energy scale.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} and spectroscopy {{studies of}} individual molecules and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) bound to a substrate. Understanding the local electronic properties of these systems is importance from a fundamental physics viewpoint and for advancing potential technological applications in nanoelectronics. Two molecular systems, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE), and bithiophene naphthalene diimide (BND), were investigated. The basic questions addressed are (1) how do molecules respond to a condensed matter environment (i. e. a metal or semiconducting surface), (2) how do spins behave in molecule-scale structures, and (3) how do the intrinsic electronic properties of molecules affect their self-assembly behavior. We find that TCNE molecules display variable surface coupling and enable tunable magnetic exchange coupling between covalently <b>bonded</b> <b>spin</b> centers in V x (TCNE) y complexes. We also were able to determine the TCNE adsorption site within a molecular monolayer on Ag(100) {{through a combination of}} inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{molecular}} physics {{has become increasingly}} important from both a scientific and technological viewpoint. The physical behavior of materials at nanometer length scales holds many surprises and the potential technological applications of molecular science arevast. This dissertation focuses on the fundamental physics of molecules adsorbed to metallic and semiconducting surfaces. Using a scanning tunneling microscope, four different molecular systems, C 60, Gd@C 82, tetramantane, and tetracyanoethylene (TCNE), were studied. The main effects investigated were (1) how can the properties of these molecules be atomically controlled, (2) how do metal surfaces affect molecular properties, (3) how do electron-electron and electron-vibration coupling influence molecular behavior, and (4) how do spins behave in molecule-scalestructures. For C 60 we demonstrate a fine control of molecular properties such as energy levels, electron-electron interactions, and electron-vibration interactions via potassiumdoping. We also find that metal surfaces strongly influence the electronic screening and ordering of adsorbed molecules. In Gd@C 82 and tetramantane molecules, the spatialdistribution of the electron-vibration coupling {{is found to be}} very inhomogeneous at sub-nanometer (- 9 m) length scales. In titanocene, we find that Au(111) induces molecular dissociation, with titanocene fragments displaying a spin-induced Kondo effect.

The methods of exact diagonalization (ED) and density-matrix-renormalization-group are employed for the large size one-dimensional (1 D) systems, and ED is applied to a two-dimensional (2 D) square lattice on small sizes. We focus on the magnetic exchange models in the Mott-insulating state at quarter-filling. Both 1 D and 2 D systems exhibit rich phase diagrams depending on the ratio between the spin exchanges J_ 0 and J_ 2 in the <b>bond</b> <b>spin</b> singlet and quintet channels, respectively. In 1 D, the ground states exhibit a long-range-ordered dimerization with a finite spin gap at J_ 0 /J_ 2 > 1, and a gapless spin liquid state at J_ 0 /J_ 2 < 1, respectively. In the former and latter cases, the correlation functions exhibit the two-site and four-site periodicities, respectively. In 2 D, various spin correlation functions are calculated up {{to the size of}} 4 × 4. The Neel-type spin correlation dominates at large values of J_ 0 /J_ 2, while a 2 × 2 plaquette correlation is prominent at small values of this ratio.
