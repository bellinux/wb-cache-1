Several days later, Scully and her partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) discuss the case in Mulder's office at FBI headquarters. Mulder relates that the case {{seems to be the}} work of a repeat offender, and {{there is reason to believe}} the couple will be killed in a matter of days. He also tells Scully that Luther Lee Boggs (Brad Dourif), a serial killer he had helped to {{apprehend}} years <b>before,</b> <b>has</b> claimed to have had psychic revelations about the kidnapping and has offered to help police in exchange for his death sentence being commuted. Mulder is unusually skeptical about Boggs' claims.|$|E

It took great effort to free the city from the snow and enable the Fasnacht to take place. Never <b>before</b> <b>has</b> a Fasnacht been celebrated with more snow, and {{especially}} not fresh-fallen snow. This 50cm of snow was the third-highest snow level ever recorded in Basel and the highest level of fresh-fallen snow within 24 hours for the city.|$|E

25|$|While the SPD {{was founded}} in the 19th century to defend the {{interests}} of the working class, its commitment to these goals has been disputed by some since 1918, when its leaders supported the suppression of more radical socialist and communist factions during the Spartacist Uprising. But never <b>before</b> <b>has</b> the party moved so far away from its traditional socialist stance as it did under the Schröder government. Its ever-increasing tendency towards liberal economic policies and cutbacks in government spending on social welfare programs led to a dramatic decline in voter support. The Schroeder Administration presided over a significant rise in poverty and inequality, with the percentage of Germans living in poverty, according to one measure, rising from 12% in 2000 to 16.5% in 2006.|$|E
25|$|On November 17, 1975, {{the police}} began to set forth action {{in order to}} bring down the {{powerful}} Dubois Brothers; they established police task forces and began pressuring the Brothers. After some time the pressure began to deteriorate the Dubois Brothers organization through undercover operations and some of the organizations most notorious and loyal associates began to slip away, become informants or had met violent deaths. The papers and police began stating that never <b>before</b> <b>has</b> the criminal underworld’s law of silence been broken by so many criminals, especially those who were so loyal to the organizations core. Among these numerous informants was Donald Lavoie {{who was one of the}} Dubois Brothers most trusted hitman whose previous occupation had been to eliminate anyone suspected of snitching as well as anyone who they told him to eliminate. It was Donald Lavoie who played the biggest part in the fall of the Dubois Brothers power, when Claude Dubois who had put a bounty on Lavoie’s head, which he just nearly escaped, forcing Lavoie to testify for protection.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Game Informer, Andrew Reiner {{said that}} the game's {{interactive}} storytelling encourages replay and that its detailed story [...] "makes the relationships feel real—you care about your crew, and you really {{feel like you have}} a voice that resonates throughout the galaxy." [...] Alex Dale of CVG stated similar pros, stating that [...] "never <b>before</b> <b>has</b> storytelling been so competently ingrained into a videogame, and never <b>before</b> <b>has</b> a player had so much freedom to dictate the course of a linear storyline." [...] Similar praise was given to the game's detailed character models, facial animations, and voice acting. Jennifer Tsao of 1UP.com felt the digital actors evoked real-life expressions, but admitted that the lip sync had some issues. Although the visuals were credited for their dramatic set pieces and evocative soundtrack, critics noted the game's inconsistent frame rate and long loading times.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of season one of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Mary McNamara at the Los Angeles Times praised the connections between that series and the films, stating that [...] "never <b>before</b> <b>has</b> television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise ... is now not only a very good show in its own right, it's part of Marvel's multiplatform city-state. It faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that {{puts it in the}} exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination." [...] Terri Schwartz of Zap2it agreed with this sentiment, stating that [...] "the fact that [...] so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven", though [...] "the fault there seems to be that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. had to bide time until The Winter Soldiers release", which led to much criticism.|$|E
500|$|However, many {{important}} differences {{exist between the}} two men. Joel Coen said: [...] "Both writers wrote {{the same kind of}} plays with proletarian heroes, but their personalities were quite different. Odets was much more of an extrovert; in fact he was quite sociable even in Hollywood, and {{this is not the case}} with Barton Fink!" [...] Although he was frustrated by his declining popularity in New York, Odets was successful during his time in Hollywood. Several of his later plays were adapted– [...] by him and others– [...] into movies. One of these, The Big Knife (1955), matches Barton's life much more than Odets'. In it, an actor becomes overwhelmed by the greed of a movie studio which hires him and eventually commits suicide. Another similarity to Odets' work is Audrey's death, which mirrors a scene in Deadline at Dawn (1946), a film noir written by Odets. In that film, a character awakens to find that the woman he bedded the night <b>before</b> <b>has</b> been inexplicably murdered.|$|E
500|$|As war clouds cast {{an ominous}} shadow over Europe {{in the late}} 1930s amidst the rise of fascism, West, Goodman, and other BSA leaders {{considered}} how Scouting might better train youth in democratic principles of government. Referring to the Nazi Kristallnacht rampage against Jews in 1938, Goodman wrote shortly afterwards: [...] "...the program of persecution has stirred up our hearts and minds as nothing else that has happened <b>before</b> <b>has</b> done. It has furnished the impetus of a wave of resentment against the evil; but more than that, for a surge of satisfaction and thanksgiving concerning our own happier state under a democracy." [...] During World War II, various BSA programs were developed under his leadership {{in support of the}} nation's war effort, such as the collection of scrap aluminum, tires, and waste paper for recycling into war material, distribution of war bond and air raid posters, assisting Civil Defense officials, and planting of fruit and vegetable [...] "victory gardens".|$|E

500|$|These {{considerations}} {{should lead}} us to look upon all the works of nature, animate or inanimate, as invested with a certain sanctity, {{to be used by}} us but not abused, and never to be recklessly destroyed or defaced. To pollute a spring or a river, to exterminate a bird or beast, should be treated as moral offences and as social crimes;... Yet during the past century, which has seen those great advances in the knowledge of Nature of which we are so proud, there has been no corresponding development of a love or reverence for her works; so that never <b>before</b> <b>has</b> there been such widespread ravage of the earth's surface by destruction of native vegetation and with it of much animal life, and such wholesale defacement of the earth by mineral workings and by pouring into our streams and rivers the refuse of manufactories and of cities; and this has been done by all the greatest nations claiming the first place for civilisation and religion! ...|$|E
500|$|Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that}} the series [...] "created a whole new sort of {{television}} show: One that must support, and change with, the plot twists of its film family ... never <b>before</b> <b>has</b> television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise." [...] She stated that the Captain America: The Winter Soldier crossover [...] "infused S.H.I.E.L.D. with a new energy, and helped explain, perhaps, why the show {{took so long to}} find its footing—in the writers' room at least ... That Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to succeed as a story both independent and ancillary is all but miraculous." [...] She concluded that the series [...] "is now not only a very good show in its own right, it's part of Marvel's multiplatform city-state.

[...] She was still photogenic, but so thin that she was sometimes described as [...] "frail" [...] or [...] "waiflike", and her husband sometimes worried about her weight. [...] She issued a half-hour campaign film that featured endorsements from many national and state party leaders {{as well as from}} celebrities Bob Hope and Art Linkletter, and showcased her family role and her concern for disadvantaged people. [...] Huber, in contrast, emphasized his edge in political experience, derided her [...] "motherly concern", and criticized the [...] "bossism" [...] that he said was trying to force another Romney into statewide office.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers were {{impressed}} with the way Lessing tackled the subject of sexual politics in the book. Paul Gray remarked in a review in Time magazine, that contrary to appearances, The Marriages is not a feminist parable, but added that while Lessing often wrote about gender conflict, she has never done it [...] "with more sweetness, compassion and wisdom" [...] as she has in this novel. Leonard commended Lessing for considering boths sides of the gender divide, for being both critical and forgiving of Ben Ata and Al•Ith. Leonard said that never <b>before</b> <b>has</b> Lessing written [...] "a gentler book", adding that her 1973 novel, Summer Before the Dark comes a close second. A reviewer in Kirkus Reviews also complemented Lessing on her handling of sexual conflict. While the review was critical of Lessing's prose style, and called her descriptions of the Zone Four war economy [...] "a silly cartoon sketch", it said that [...] "there is a... generosity about this work not quite like anything she has done".|$|E

Gordon Brown was said to be [...] "seething" [...] and [...] "dismayed" [...] over the criticism he received from Blair in the book, but had told aides not to criticise it.
