5|$|Mercury and cadmium are toxic and {{may cause}} {{environmental}} damage if they enter rivers or rain water. This {{may result in}} contaminated crops {{as well as the}} <b>bioaccumulation</b> of mercury in a food chain leading to an increase in illnesses caused by mercury and cadmium poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The {{pink-backed pelican}} {{has a large}} {{population}} ranging over much of Sub-Saharan Africa. In the absence of substantial threats or evidence of declines across its range, its conservation status is assessed as being of Least Concern. Regional threats include the drainage of wetlands and increasing disturbance in southern Africa. The species is susceptible to <b>bioaccumulation</b> of toxins and {{to the destruction of}} nesting trees by logging.|$|E
5|$|Americium is an {{artificial}} element of recent origin, and thus {{does not have}} a biological requirement. It is harmful to life. It has been proposed to use bacteria for removal of americium and other heavy metals from rivers and streams. Thus, Enterobacteriaceae of the genus Citrobacter precipitate americium ions from aqueous solutions, binding them into a metal-phosphate complex at their cell walls. Several studies have been reported on the biosorption and <b>bioaccumulation</b> of americium by bacteria and fungi.|$|E
5|$|Lead has no {{confirmed}} biological role. Its prevalence in {{the human}} body—at an adult average of 120mg—is nevertheless exceeded only by zinc (2500mg) and iron (4000mg) among the heavy metals. Lead salts are very efficiently absorbed by the body. A small amount of lead (1%) is stored in bones; the rest is excreted in urine and feces {{within a few weeks}} of exposure. Only about a third of lead is excreted by a child. Continual exposure may result in the <b>bioaccumulation</b> of lead.|$|E
5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} were once intensively hunted for their meat and eggs; {{consumption}} has decreased, however, due to worldwide legislation. Despite this, turtle meat and eggs are still consumed {{in countries where}} regulations are not strictly enforced. In Mexico, turtle eggs are a common meal; locals claim the egg is an aphrodisiac. Eating turtle eggs or meat can cause serious illness due to harmful bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens, {{and high levels of}} toxic metals that build up through <b>bioaccumulation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{people could}} {{do little to}} protect their crops from being devastated by locusts, {{although}} eating the insects {{may have been some}} consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made to disrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its <b>bioaccumulation</b> in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other animals}} {{at the highest}} trophic levels, the killer whale is {{particularly}} at risk of poisoning from <b>bioaccumulation</b> of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbor seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated {{with high levels of}} PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbor seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in their blood.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic {{chemical}} {{production has}} escalated following the stimulus it received {{during the second}} World War. Chemical production includes everything from herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers to domestic chemicals and hazardous substances. Apart from the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, chemicals of particular concern include: heavy metals, nuclear waste, chlorofluorocarbons, persistent organic pollutants and all harmful chemicals capable of <b>bioaccumulation.</b> Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless {{there needs to be}} rigorous testing of new chemicals, in all countries, for adverse environmental and health effects. International legislation has been established to deal with the global distribution and management of dangerous goods. The effects of some chemical agents needed long-term measurements and a lot of legal battles to realize their danger to human health. The classification of the toxic carcinogenic agents is handle by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.|$|E
25|$|From the {{contamination}} of the sediment, more of the ecosystem is effected. Organisms in the sediment are now exposed to the new chemicals. Organisms are then ingested by fish and other aquatic animals. These animals now contain concentrations of hazardous chemicals which were secreted from the creosote. Other issues with ecosystems include <b>bioaccumulation.</b> <b>Bioaccumulation</b> occurs when high levels of chemicals are passed to aquatic life near the creosote pilings. Mollusks and other smaller crustaceans are at higher risk because they are directly attached {{to the surface of}} wood pilings that are filled with creosote preservative. Studies show that mollusks in these environments take on high concentrations of chemical compounds which will then be transferred through the ecosystem's food chain. <b>Bioaccumulation</b> contributes to the higher concentrations of chemicals within the organisms in the aquatic ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of tissue}} {{residues}} in assessing toxicity and <b>bioaccumulation</b> {{may also be}} referred to as the tissue residue-effects approach (TRA), critical body residue (CBR) or tissue residue-based toxicity tests.|$|E
25|$|Different bivalve {{species have}} {{different}} <b>bioaccumulation</b> abilities for trace metals, {{and as a}} result oysters will accumulate about 10 times more zinc and copper than mussels. Mussels will accumulate about 3 times more lead than oysters.|$|E
25|$|While {{studies using}} {{semi-permeable}} membrane devices {{have found that}} triclosan does not strongly bioaccumulate, methyl-triclosan is comparatively more stable and lipophilic and thus poses {{a higher risk of}} <b>bioaccumulation.</b> The ability of triclosan to bioaccumulate is affected by its ionization state in different environmental conditions.|$|E
25|$|Fruit bats are {{considered}} a delicacy by South Pacific Islanders, {{as well as in}} Micronesia. Consumption has been suggested as a cause of Lytico-Bodig disease on the Micronesian island of Guam, through <b>bioaccumulation</b> of a plant toxin to which the bats are immune.|$|E
25|$|Dioxins {{accumulate}} in food chains {{in a fashion}} similar to other chlorinated compounds (<b>bioaccumulation).</b> This means that even small concentrations in contaminated water can be concentrated up a food chain to dangerous levels because of the long biological half life and low water solubility of dioxins.|$|E
25|$|The {{ingestion}} of goitrogen drugs is, much like potassium iodide also {{not without its}} dangers, such as hypothyroidism. In all these cases however, despite the risks, the prophylaxis benefits of intervention with iodide, iodate or perchlorate outweigh the serious cancer risk from radioiodine <b>bioaccumulation</b> in regions where radioiodine has sufficiently contaminated the environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{released}} nuclides can undergo <b>bioaccumulation.</b> Iodine-131, strontium-90 and caesium-137 {{are concentrated}} in milk of grazing cows; cow milk is therefore a convenient, sensitive fallout indicator. Soft tissues of animals can be analyzed for gamma emitters, bones and liver for strontium and plutonium, and blood, urine and soft tissues are analyzed for tritium.|$|E
25|$|Sewage may drain {{directly}} into major watersheds with minimal or no treatment but this usually has serious {{impacts on the}} quality of an environment and on the health of people. Pathogens can cause a variety of illnesses. Some chemicals pose risks even at very low concentrations and can remain a threat {{for long periods of time}} because of <b>bioaccumulation</b> in animal or human tissue.|$|E
25|$|In general, many {{insects are}} herbivorous and less {{problematic}} than omnivores. Cooking is advisable in ideal circumstances since parasites of concern may be present. But pesticide use can make insects unsuitable for human consumption. Herbicides can accumulate in insects through <b>bioaccumulation.</b> For example, when locust outbreaks are treated by spraying, people {{can no longer}} eat them. This may pose a problem since edible plants have been consumed by the locusts themselves.|$|E
25|$|Organofluorine {{chemistry}} {{describes the}} chemistry of the organofluorines, organic compounds that contain the carbon–fluorine bond. Organofluorine compounds find diverse applications ranging from oil and water repellents to pharmaceuticals, refrigerants, and reagents in catalysis. In addition to these applications, some organofluorine compounds are pollutants because of their contributions to ozone depletion, global warming, <b>bioaccumulation,</b> and toxicity. The area of organofluorine chemistry often requires special techniques associated with the handling of fluorinating agents.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} of a {{radioiodine}} release the ingestion of prophylaxis potassium iodide, if available, or even iodate, would rightly take precedence over perchlorate administration, and would be the first line of defence in protecting the population from a radioiodine release. However, in {{the event of}} a radioiodine release too massive and widespread to be controlled by the limited stock of iodide and iodate prophylaxis drugs, then the addition of perchlorate ions to the water supply, or distribution of perchlorate tablets would serve as a cheap, efficacious, second line of defense against carcinogenic radioiodine <b>bioaccumulation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Arctic is {{comparatively}} clean, {{although there}} are certain ecologically difficult localized pollution problems that present {{a serious threat to}} people's health living around these pollution sources. Due to the prevailing worldwide sea and air currents, the Arctic area is the fallout region for long-range transport pollutants, and in some places the concentrations exceed the levels of densely populated urban areas. An example of this is the phenomenon of Arctic haze, which is commonly blamed on long-range pollutants. Another example is with the <b>bioaccumulation</b> of PCB's (polychlorinated biphenyls) in Arctic wildlife and people.|$|E
25|$|Tissue residue is the {{concentration}} of a chemical or compound in an organism’s tissue, or a portion of an organism’s tissue. Tissue residue is used in aquatic toxicology to help determine the fate of chemicals in aquatic systems, <b>bioaccumulation</b> of a substance, bioavailability of a substance, account for multiple routes of exposure (ingestion, absorption, inhalation), and address an organism’s exposure to chemical mixtures. A Tissue residue approach to toxicity testing is considered a more direct and less variable measure of chemical exposure and is less dependent on external environmental factors than measuring {{the concentration}} of a chemical in the exposure media.|$|E
25|$|Ecological risk {{assessment}} aims to {{source of contamination}} to exposure to a toxicity endpoint. This requires a risk assessor to identify and estimate exposure pathways. Tissue residue is the only approach that inherently accounts for toxicity due to multiple exposure pathways. There is also a need in {{risk assessment}} to understand the <b>bioaccumulation</b> of chemicals4, {{as well as a}} direct estimation of bioavailability. Modeling food web exposure is difficult in risk assessment and requires many assumptions but this uncertainty can be reduced through tissue residue. Tissue residue may also allow provide a link between ecological risk assessment and human health risk assessment.|$|E
25|$|The longest-acting {{barbiturates}} have half-lives {{of a day}} or more, {{and subsequently}} result in <b>bioaccumulation</b> of the drug in the system. The therapeutic and recreational effects of long-acting barbiturates wear off significantly faster than the drug can be eliminated, allowing the drug to reach toxic concentrations in the blood following repeated administration (even when taken at the therapeutic/prescribed dose) despite the user feeling little or no effects from the plasma-bound concentrations of the drug. Users who consume alcohol or other sedatives after the drugs effects have worn but before it has cleared the system may experience a greatly exaggerated effect from the other sedatives which can be incapacitating or even fatal.|$|E
25|$|Apart from plastics, {{there are}} {{particular}} problems with other toxins {{that do not}} disintegrate rapidly in the marine environment. Examples of persistent toxins are PCBs, DDT, TBT, pesticides, furans, dioxins, phenols, and radioactive waste. Heavy metals are metallic chemical elements that have a relatively high density and are toxic or poisonous at low concentrations. Examples are mercury, lead, nickel, arsenic, and cadmium. Such toxins can accumulate in the tissues of many species of aquatic life in a process called <b>bioaccumulation.</b> They are also known to accumulate in benthic environments, such as estuaries and bay muds: a geological record of human activities of the last century.|$|E
25|$|Dioxins {{build up}} {{primarily}} in fatty tissues over time (<b>bioaccumulation),</b> so even small exposures may eventually reach dangerous levels. In 1994, the US EPA reported that dioxins are a probable carcinogen, but noted that non-cancer effects (reproduction and sexual development, immune system) may pose a greater threat to human health. TCDD, the most toxic of the dibenzodioxins, {{is classified as}} a Group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). TCDD has a half-life of approximately 8 years in humans, although at high concentrations, the elimination rate is enhanced by metabolism. The health effects of dioxins are mediated by their action on a cellular receptor, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR).|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} a bloom of C. raciborskii on an {{aquaculture}} pond in Townsville, Australia was assessed in 1997. The pond contained Redclaw crayfish, along {{with a population of}} Lake Eacham Rainbowfish to control the excess food. Analysis revealed that the water contained both extracellular and intracellular CYN, and that the crayfish had accumulated this primarily in the liver but also in the muscle tissue. Examination of the gut contents revealed cyanobacterial cells, indicating that the crayfish had ingested intracellular toxin. An experiment using an extract of the bloom showed that it was also possible to uptake extracellular toxin directly into the tissues. Such <b>bioaccumulation,</b> particularly in the aquaculture industry, was of concern, especially when humans were the end users of the product.|$|E
25|$|To {{completely}} {{block the}} uptake of iodine-131 by the purposeful addition of perchlorate ions to a population's water supply, aiming at dosages of 0.5mg/kg-day, or a water concentration of 17 ppm, would therefore be grossly inadequate at truly reducing radioiodine uptake. Perchlorate ion concentrations in a region's water supply would therefore {{need to be}} much higher, {{with at least a}} total dosage of 7.15mg/kg of body weight per day needing to be aimed for, with this being achievable for most adults by consuming 2 liters of water per day with a water concentration of 250mg/kg of water, or 250 ppm of perchlorate ions per liter; only at this level would perchlorate consumption offer adequate protection, and be truly beneficial to the population at preventing <b>bioaccumulation</b> when exposed to a radioiodine environment. This being entirely independent of the availability of iodate or iodide drugs.|$|E
25|$|International catastrophes such as {{the wreck}} of the Amoco Cadiz oil tanker off the coast of Brittany in 1978 and the Bhopal {{disaster}} in 1984 have demonstrated the universality of such events and the scale on which efforts to address them needed to engage. The borderless nature of atmosphere and oceans inevitably resulted in the implication of pollution on a planetary level with the issue of global warming. Most recently the term persistent organic pollutant (POP) has come to describe a group of chemicals such as PBDEs and PFCs among others. Though their effects remain somewhat less well understood owing to a lack of experimental data, they have been detected in various ecological habitats far removed from industrial activity {{such as the}} Arctic, demonstrating diffusion and <b>bioaccumulation</b> after only a relatively brief period of widespread use.|$|E
25|$|Because {{methylmercury}} {{is formed}} in aquatic systems {{and because it}} is not readily eliminated from organisms it is biomagnified in aquatic food chains from bacteria, to plankton, through macroinvertebrates, to herbivorous fish and to piscivorous (fish-eating) fish. At each step in the food chain, the concentration of methylmercury in the organism increases. The concentration of methylmercury in the top level aquatic predators can reach a level a million times higher than the level in the water. This is because methylmercury has a half-life of about 72 days in aquatic organisms resulting in its <b>bioaccumulation</b> within these food chains. Organisms, including humans, fish-eating birds, and fish-eating mammals such as otters and whales that consume fish {{from the top of the}} aquatic food chain receive the methylmercury that has accumulated through this process. Fish and other aquatic species are the only significant source of human methylmercury exposure.|$|E
25|$|Tritium is an isotope of hydrogen, {{which allows}} it to readily bind to {{hydroxyl}} radicals, forming tritiated water (HTO), and to carbon atoms. Since tritium is a low energy beta emitter, it is not dangerous externally (its beta particles are unable to penetrate the skin), {{but it can be}} a radiation hazard when inhaled, ingested via food or water, or absorbed through the skin. HTO has a short biological half-life in the human body of 7 to 14 days, which both reduces the total effects of single-incident ingestion and precludes long-term <b>bioaccumulation</b> of HTO from the environment. Biological half life of tritiated water in human body, which is a measure of body water turn over, varies with season. Studies on biological half life of occupational radiation workers for free water tritium in the coastal region of Karnataka, India show that the biological half life in winter season is twice that of the summer season.|$|E
25|$|The {{duration}} of triclosan in personal product use is relatively short. Upon disposal, triclosan {{is sent to}} municipal sewage treatment plants, where about 97-98% of triclosan is removed. Studies show that substantial quantities of triclosan (170,000 – 970,000kg/yr) can break through wastewater treatment plants and damage algae on surface waters. In a study on effluent from wastewater treatment facilities, approximately 75% of triclocarban was present in sludge. This poses a potential environmental and ecological hazard, particularly for aquatic systems. The volume of triclosan re-entering the environment in sewage sludge after initial successful capture from wastewater is 44,000 ± 60,000kg/yr. Triclosan can attach to other substances suspended in aquatic environments, which potentially endangers marine organisms and may lead to further <b>bioaccumulation.</b> Ozone {{is considered to be}} an effective tool for removing triclosan during sewage treatment. As little triclosan is released through plastic and textile household consumer products, these are not considered to be major sources of triclosan contamination.|$|E
25|$|Further {{research}} should be conducted in order to fill the gaps in entomotoxicology. Such areas as <b>bioaccumulation,</b> insect metabolism of drugs, and quantitative analyses of insect evidence have only begun to be researched. Because it {{is a relatively new}} branch of forensic entomology, entomotoxicology has its limitations. According to Pounder’s research, there is no correlation between the drug concentration in tissue and the larvae feeding on that tissue. Entomological specimens make for excellent qualitative toxicological specimens. There is, however, a lack of research in the way of developing an assessment that can quantify the concentration of a drug in tissue using entomological evidence. One {{reason for this is that}} a drug can only be detected in larvae when the rate of absorption exceeds the rate of elimination. demonstrated this theory using Calliphora vicina larvae reared on human skeletal muscle obtained from cases of co-proxamol and amitriptyline overdose. Samples of pupae and third instar larvae no longer contained concentrations of the drugs, suggesting that drugs do not bioaccumulate over the entire life-cycle of larvae. This leads entomologists to theorize that toxins are eliminated from the larvae’s system over time if they are not receiving a constant supply of the toxin.|$|E
25|$|Although {{classified}} as a yellow label (highly toxic) pesticide by the Central Insecticides Board, India {{is one of the}} largest producers and the largest consumer of endosulfan in the world. Of the total volume manufactured in India, three companies — Excel Crop Care, Hindustan Insecticides Ltd, and Coromandal Fertilizers — produce 4,500 tonnes annually for domestic use and another 4,000 tonnes for export. Endosulfan is widely used in most of the plantation crops in India. The toxicity of endosulfan and health issues due to its <b>bioaccumulation</b> came under media attention when health issues precipitated in the Kasargod District (of Kerala) were publicised. This inspired protests, and the pesticide was banned in Kerala as early as 2001, following a report by the National Institute of Occupational Health. In the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants of 2011, when an international consensus arose for the global ban of the pesticide, India opposed this move due to pressure from the endosulfan manufacturing companies. This flared up the protest, and while India still maintained its stance, the global conference decided on a global ban, for which India asked a remission for 10 years. Later, on a petition filed in the Supreme Court of India, the production, storage, sale and use of the pesticide was temporarily banned on 13 May 2011, and later permanently by the end of 2011.|$|E
25|$|The {{species was}} accidentally {{introduced}} into the North American Great Lakes by way of ballast water transfer in cargo ships. First discovered in North America in the St. Clair River in 1990, the round goby is considered an invasive species with significant ecological and economic impact; the consequences are quite complex as the fish both competes with native species and provides an abundant source of food for them while consuming other invasive species. In other words, the round goby behaves much like most biological invasive controls. An aggressive fish, the round goby outcompetes native species such as the sculpin and logperch for food (such as snails and mussels), shelter and nesting sites, substantially reducing their numbers. Round gobies are also voracious predators of eggs of native fish, many important to the angling industry. The goby's robust ability to survive in degraded environmental conditions has helped to increase its competitive advantage compared to native species. Many native predatory fish such as smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, walleye, salmon and trout have begun to prey on round gobies. The incorporation of the round goby into native foodwebs, coupled with the goby's ability to consume large numbers of invasive mussels (zebra and quagga), may result in greater <b>bioaccumulation</b> of toxins such as PCBs higher in the food chain, since these mussels filter-feed and are known to accumulate persistent contaminants. However, this is partly beneficial because {{even though they do}} not reduce the population of zebra mussels, they do control their population. Hence, it prevents a large scale spread of the zebra mussel, which is also an invasive species in the Great Lakes.|$|E
25|$|Toxicants {{may also}} cause {{endocrine}} disruption through {{interacting with the}} estrogen receptor. This mechanism has been well-studied with PCBs. These chemicals {{have been used as}} coolants and lubricants in transformers and other electrical equipment due to their insulating properties. A purely anthropogenic substance, PCBs are no longer in production in the United States due to the adverse health effects associated with exposure, but they are highly persistent and are still widespread in the environment. PCBs are a xenoestrogen, which elicit an enhancing (rather than inhibiting) response, and are mediated by the estrogen receptor. These are often referred to as estrogen mimics because they mimic the effects of estrogen. PCBs often build up in sediments and bioaccumulate in organisms. These chemicals diffuse into the nucleus and bind to the estrogen receptor. The estrogen receptor is kept in an inactive conformation through interactions with proteins such as heat shock proteins 59, 70, and 90. After the toxicant binding occurs, the estrogen receptor is activated and forms a homodimer complex which seeks out estrogen response elements in the DNA. The binding of the complex to these elements causes a rearrangement of the chromatin and transcription of the gene, resulting in production of a specific protein. In doing this, PCBs elicit an estrogenic response which can affect numerous functions within the organism. These effects are observed in various aquatic species. The levels of PCBs in marine mammals are often very high as a result of <b>bioaccumulation.</b> Studies have demonstrated that PCBs are responsible for reproductive impairment in the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). Similar effects have been found in the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), the ringed seal (Pusa hispida) and the California sea lion (Zalophys californinus). In the grey seals and ringed seals, uterine occlusions and stenosis were found which led to sterility. If exposed to a xenoestrogen such as PCBs, male fish have also been seen to produce vitellogenin. Vitellogenin is an egg protein female fish normally produce but is not usually present in males except at very low concentrations. This is often used as a biomarker for EDCs.|$|E
