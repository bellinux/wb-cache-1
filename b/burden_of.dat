5|$|According to the Court of Appeal, the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> {{proof of}} {{justifying}} the lawfulness of the appellants' detention was, {{in the first}} instance, on the detaining authority. This <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof could be discharged by evidence that the President, acting in accordance with advice of the Cabinet or an authorized minister, was satisfied that the detention was necessary for national security purposes, and by {{the production of the}} detention order. Once the detaining authority had discharged the initial <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof, a <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof fell on the appellants to challenge their detention on GCHQ grounds.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{no longer}} having the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> his professorial and garden duties, {{by the late}} 1870s the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> {{maintaining}} himself as the pillar of American botany prevented Gray from the progress he desired on Synoptical Flora of North America, the follow-on to Flora of North America. This burden consisted {{of the fact that}} other scientists often only accepted Gray's word on a botanical matter, and the number of incoming specimens to identify was increasing vastly: numbers had to be assigned to them, collectors needed to be corresponded with, and preliminary papers had to be published. By the early 1880s, Gray's home was the center of everything to do with botany in America. Every aspiring botanist came to see him, even if just to look at him through his window.|$|E

5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof.|$|E

40|$|In jurisdictions that {{subscribe}} to adversarial mode <b>of</b> litigation, <b>burdens</b> and standards <b>of</b> proof have significant {{roles in the}} adjudication and determination of criminal cases. The operation {{of the principle of}} presumption of innocence in such jurisdictions determines issues of who bears what burden and the extent thereof. The Ethiopian criminal procedure system predominantly exhibits adversarial features, and there is the need for the comprehension and enforcement <b>of</b> the respective <b>burdens</b> and standards <b>of</b> proof borne by litigants. The constraints in clarity are more pronounced in those criminal law provisions that embrace some form of presumptions such as provisions on corruption offences. This note highlights how issues <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> and standard <b>of</b> proof are allocated as between prosecuting authorities and accused persons. Apart from explaining the nexus between the principle of presumption <b>of</b> innocence, <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> proof and standards of proof, it indicates the implications of the operation of the principle of presumption of innocence upon the allocation of evidential and persuasive <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> proof as {{between the state and the}} accused. It further outlines the effects of the various forms of presumptions upon the different kinds <b>of</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> proof...|$|R
