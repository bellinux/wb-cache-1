5|$|During the 1965 {{parliamentary}} election Karmal {{was one of}} four PDPA members elected to the lower house of parliament; the three others were Anahita Ratebzad, Nur Ahmed Nur and Fezanul Haq Fezan. No Khalqists were elected; however, Amin was 50 votes short of being elected. The Parchamite victory may be explained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> fact that Karmal could contribute financially to the PDPA electoral campaign. Karmal became a leading figure within the student movement in the 1960s, electing Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal as Prime Minister after a student demonstration (called for by Karmal) concluded with three deaths under the former leadership.|$|E
5|$|In October 1941 the LRDG was {{expanded}} to 10 patrols <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> method of splitting the existing patrols into two-half patrols; the New Zealanders formed A Squadron comprising 'R1', 'R2', 'T1', and 'T2' Patrols and the British and Rhodesians formed B Squadron comprising 'G1', 'G2', 'S1', 'S2', 'Y1', and 'Y2' Patrols. The 'H' Patrol had been disbanded in September 1941 {{after three months}} service.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} {{conservation of}} seamounts is hurt <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> {{lack of information}} available. Seamounts are very poorly studied, with only 350 of the estimated 100,000 seamounts in the world having received sampling, and fewer than 100 in depth. Much of this lack of information {{can be attributed to}} a lack of technology, and to the daunting task of reaching these underwater structures; the technology to fully explore them has only been around the last few decades. Before consistent conservation efforts can begin, the seamounts of the world must first be mapped, a task that is still in progress.|$|E

5|$|The {{landmark}} scientific expedition (December 1872 – May 1876) of the British Royal Navy {{survey ship}} HMS Challenger yielded {{a tremendous amount}} of bathymetric data, much of which has been confirmed by subsequent researchers. Bathymetric data obtained {{during the course of the}} Challenger expedition enabled scientists to draw maps, which provided a rough outline of certain major submarine terrain features, such as the edge of the continental shelves and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This discontinuous set of data points was obtained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> technique of taking soundings by lowering long lines from the ship to the seabed.|$|E
5|$|The major {{contribution}} of the Henri-Michaelis-Menten approach was to think of enzyme reactions in two stages. In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis complex. The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. The kinetics of many enzymes is adequately described <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> Michaelis-Menten model, but all enzymes have internal motions that are not accounted for in the model and can have significant contributions to the overall reaction kinetics. This can be modeled by introducing several Michaelis-Menten pathways that are connected with fluctuating rates, which is a mathematical extension of the basic Michaelis Menten mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The {{sadness of}} the harsh {{conditions}} {{of those days}} is captured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> epitaph on the gravestone of James Myers who is buried in the Methodist Cemetery at Yeadon behind the Town Hall. James was a married man just 22 years old who 'died by an accident in the Bramhope Tunnel on the 14th day of April, 1848'. Next to him lies the body of his 3 years old daughter who died two weeks later of some unspecified illness.|$|E

5|$|Alan Brigman was the {{technical}} director and co-producer. He and Mike Woodroffe developed a game creation system, Adventure Graphic Operating System (AGOS) II, which facilitated {{the development of}} Simon the Sorcerer and enabled the team {{to focus on the}} gameplay and story without worrying about {{the technical}} aspects. The system allowed the developers to input text commands on a separate monitor, and the engine could be ported to other platforms. Other features of the engine included translating actions performed by the mouse into text commands (a sentence parser carries them out), the loading of data as-needed, and functions could be implemented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> addition of commands. The game was built as a database, which contained tables for rooms and objects. These tables contained animation code and information about what is supposed to happen. Alan Cox was also involved {{in the development of the}} AGOS engine, which is based on AberMUD.|$|E

25|$|Pectus excavatum is {{differentiated}} {{from other}} disorders {{by a series}} of elimination of signs and symptoms. Pectus carinatum is excluded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> observation of a collapsing of the sternum rather than a protrusion. Kyphoscoliosis is excluded by diagnostic imaging of the spine, where in pectus excavatum the spine usually appears normal in structure.|$|E
25|$|A longstanding Pisot–Vijayaraghavan problem {{asks whether}} the {{assumption}} that α is algebraic can be dropped from the last statement. If the answer is affirmative, Pisot's numbers would be characterized among all real numbers <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> convergence of ||λα'n|| to 0 for some auxiliary real λ. It is known {{that there are only}} countably many numbers α with this property. The problem is to decide whether any of them is transcendental.|$|E

25|$|Part of the 1994 National Register of Historic Places listing for the University of Illinois Experimental Dairy Farm Historic District {{includes}} three round barns. The barns were constructed {{every two years}} from 1908 thru 1912. The barns are known <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> designations, Barn #1, Barn #2 and Building #857. Though all round barns, Building #857 includes a rectangular brick wing attached to main round section of the building.|$|E
25|$|In England, {{towards the}} end the 18th century, {{architecture}} was dominated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> symmetrical Classical forms of Georgian architecture. This style was transported to Sydney along with the first English settlers and the accompanying military regiments. However, among England's elite there was a growing taste for the picturesque Gothic style. This too was introduced to Australia, and Sydney's convict architect, Francis Greenway, employed it {{in the construction of}} the Government Stables with battlements and towers.|$|E
25|$|Existing thick {{walls and}} heavy {{buildings}} provided a ready-made {{alternative to a}} pillbox and many were converted to defensive positions <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> expedient of adding embrasures to them. Whatever may be lacking in protection was made up for by convenience and perfect camouflage. At Beaulieu in Hampshire, an existing dairy store was hardened {{for use as a}} fortification by thickening the walls and reducing the size of the windows to gunslits, retaining the original windows on the outside as a cover.|$|E

It was quite formidable, but not many were built before it was replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>simpler</b> 234/1, with a 20mm gun, in 1944.|$|R
25|$|Insects {{were once}} {{believed}} to exchange gases {{with the environment}} continuously <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> diffusion of gases into the tracheal system. More recently, however, large variation in insect ventilatory patterns have been documented and insect respiration appears to be highly variable. Some small insects do not demonstrate continuous respiratory movements and may lack muscular control of the spiracles. Others, however, utilize muscular contraction of the abdomen along with coordinated spiracle contraction and relaxation to generate cyclical gas exchange patterns and to reduce water loss into the atmosphere. The most extreme form of these patterns is termed discontinuous gas exchange cycles.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} ports and re-releases of Flicky. It was first ported to the SG-1000 in Japan, and then later to other Japanese home consoles. In 1991, Flicky was released in North America and Europe on the Sega Genesis; this port was reviewed by many western publications. Critics agreed that although the game had poor graphics and sound, these problems were overcome <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> yet engaging and addicting gameplay. Flicky has been included in various Sega video game compilations, and the main character has made appearances in several other early Sega arcade games. She has continued to hold cameo appearances in Sega video games, most notably within the Sonic the Hedgehog series.|$|E
25|$|Moved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> love of Jof and Mia, Block relaxes {{his pursuit}} of {{religious}} meaning. He invites Plog and the actors to shelter in his castle, where he believes they will be safer from the plague. Along the way, the party encounters Skat and Lisa in the forest. Dissatisfied with her new lover (and well aware that her husband will rapidly forgive her), Lisa rapidly abandons Skat and returns to Plog, while Skat uses his acting skills—and possibly Jof's collusion—to fake a remorseful suicide. Once the group has moved on, Skat climbs a tree for the night. Appearing and informing the actor that his time is up, Death then cuts down the tree and kills him.|$|E
