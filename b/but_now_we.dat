There's nothing to be happy about, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> have to find a way to lift ourselves for the league game on Sunday." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{reported}} that Madhur Bhandarkar had been approached to direct the film, but later turned down the offer because of other working commitments. It was confirmed in November 2011 that Vishal Mahadkar, director of Blood Money, was to direct the picture, but the following month {{it was announced that}} Mohit Suri had replaced Mahadkar as director at the last minute. Bhatt confirmed the development, saying [...] "Earlier we had finalised Vishal for the project. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> have scrapped that idea and found a fresh one. We got Mohit to direct the film". Several media outlets falsely reported that the film is a remake of the Vishesh films 1990 love triangle Awaargi. However, Mahesh Bhatt denied the rumours and said [...] "Aashiqui 2 is not a remake of any of our films. It's an original script. A very contemporary love story dealing with mature emotions." ...|$|E

For this, Thain used Quake2Max, a modification of Quake II that provided cel-shaded animation. The following year, Tommy Pallotta directed [...] "In the Waiting Line" [...] for the British group Zero 7. He told Computer Graphics World, [...] "It probably would have been quicker to do the film in a 3D animated program. <b>But</b> <b>now,</b> <b>we</b> can reuse the assets in an improvisational way."

500|$|Lamont {{has said}} that Labour lost the 2011 Scottish Parliament {{election}} because the party lost its direction, and that having failed to recognise the 2007 result as a defeat, it picked up the wrong signals from the 2010 general election that saw a strong Scottish Labour vote at Westminster. In February 2012 she told the Times Educational Supplement, [...] "We misread the 2010 (general) election, thinking it was confirmation that Scotland was a Labour country– it was probably confirmation that Scotland was still anti-Tory. There's an issue about rebuilding trust, and our confidence in the values that brought us into politics." [...] She told delegates at her party's 2012 Scottish conference {{that it was time}} for them to stop apologising for past mistakes. [...] "We know what happened last May – we looked tired and complacent and we got the kind of beating we deserved. <b>But</b> <b>now,</b> <b>we</b> need to start building the kind of Scottish Labour Party which Scotland deserves and which Scotland needs." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an issue}} of Catalyst, the Catholic League responded to Rosenberg's article. They argued that Rosenberg was biased against Catholics, in that he was content with the series lampooning Catholicism, but not other religions. They wrote, [...] "all along {{we have been told}} by Fox that none of our {{complaints}} were valid because none of the material was truly offensive. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> have a Fox executive producer disingenuously giving away his hand by protesting why it should be okay to offend another group of people with the same material he initially said wasn't offensive to Catholics! And isn't it striking that Rosenberg is upset {{with the fact that the}} double standard—which now, for the first time works positively for Catholics—is a real problem. Never do we remember Rosenberg protesting the double standard that allows 'artists' to dump on Catholics while protecting most other segments of society from their assaults." [...] The League also complimented the members' participation, writing, [...] "It only goes to prove what can be done when Catholics get actively involved." ...|$|E

500|$|The first skeleton, {{known as}} the London Specimen (BMNH 37001), was {{unearthed}} in 1861 near Langenaltheim, Germany, and perhaps given to local physician Karl Häberlein in return for medical services. He then sold it for £700 to the Natural History Museum in London, where it remains. Missing most of its head and neck, it was described in 1863 by Richard Owen as Archaeopteryx macrura, allowing for the possibility it {{did not belong to}} the same species as the feather. In the subsequent fourth edition of his On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin described how some authors had maintained [...] "that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence during the eocene period; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> know, on the authority of professor Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper greensand; and still more recently, that strange bird, the Archaeopteryx, with a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint, and with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in the oolitic slates of Solnhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows more forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|The club's poor run of form {{continued}} in their next home match against Watford, as they suffered their fifth straight defeat and slipped {{to the bottom}} of the league table. Another 3–1 defeat, against Newcastle United, was followed by a second successive 1–0 home defeat against Nottingham Forest, to leave Argyle with just two points from their first seven matches. Paul Sturrock kept faith with the young defensive pairing of James Chester and Shane Lowry for their next game against Peterborough United, and two second-half goals Mackie and Rory Fallon secured Argyle's first three points of the new season. [...] "It's nice to get three points, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> have to build on it," [...] said Sturrock. [...] "There's no point in us getting this result and then kicking ourselves in the teeth again." [...] Argyle earned their first home win of the season four days later against Scunthorpe United. A penalty from Judge gave the hosts a 2–1 win after Fallon's opening goal was cancelled out by Scunthorpe striker Gary Hooper. Their upturn in results was halted by Blackpool, who won 2–0 at Bloomfield Road. The hosts opening goal was scored by Marcel Seip, a player on loan from Argyle. He took part in the match following a request from former manager Ian Holloway, a decision which was criticised by supporters but defended by senior Argyle officials. [...] "I suppose it was bound to happen that Marcel would score the goal, but I don't think we should look on it as anything other than probably the cover should have been better," [...] said executive director Keith Todd. [...] "We understood exactly what we are doing." ...|$|E

Jean Trinh of The Daily Beast said that Azalea never disappoints with her music videos, and {{described}} the [...] "Bounce" [...] video as [...] "breathtaking" [...] and [...] "entertaining". Liza Darwin of MTV News praised the video's fashion, and quipped, [...] "Now that the clip's finally premiered, everyone can bask in its glimmering, glittering glory". Jessie Peterson of the same website likened Azalea's bodysuit to Babi in the 1982 film Namak Halaal, and zentai. Natalie Wall of Cosmopolitan complimented the Bollywood theme and called Azalea her [...] "new style crush". Stephen Kearse of Respect. wrote that the artistic texture of the visual was [...] "so rich that the song and music video became inextricable, each always invoking each other". Kearse said it brought the song to life, and added, [...] "It is unclear {{whether or not the}} song was produced with such an affinity for Indian images, but the match up genuinely works". Brian Josephs of Complex commended the avoidance of a clichéd club setting, and called the video [...] "fun to watch". Idolator's Sam Lansky said the video [...] "does the trick" [...] and was [...] "fun, in a super-culturally appropriate way". The video's global theme was compared to that of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis' [...] "Can't Hold Us" [...] by a writer for MuchMusic who opined that Azalea provided a good representation of Indian style and culture, and complimented her appreciation of it. Conversely, Ingrid Kesa of Oyster felt it followed the trend of filming a high-budget video in a developing country. While John Robinson of The Guardian was critical of the video's [...] "rather tired Bollywood concept".|$|E

500|$|Jim Harrington of The Oakland Tribune {{described}} {{the show as}} a human embodiment of Britney Spears' [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" [...] (2002). He presumed [...] that the tour was a conscious transition for fans {{who did not want}} Cyrus to separate herself from the Hannah Montana franchise. Kirsty Cameron of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Despite her relatively young age, Cyrus showed her unfailing capability as performer. With the help of her back-up dancers, Cyrus provided her audience with choreographed set pieces and a different spectacle for each song." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe noted that the Wonder World Tour presented Cyrus as both a [...] "PG-rated tween pop star and an edgy rocker eager". He stated that although she played both roles well, it was apparent that she was more at ease with the latter. Reed also felt the concert did little to display Cyrus' personality and ability to engage with the audience. [...] "We know she's got impressive vocal chops, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> need to feel what she's trying to put across in her songs, something beyond the standard 'You guys are awesome!' banter." [...] Scott Iwasaki of Deseret News reviewed a concert in which Cyrus was ill. He mentioned that because of her illness, her voice went flat. Iwasaki also expressed his viewpoint that [...] "if there [...] any worries that Miley Cyrus would become another Britney Spears train wreck, those worries were quelled during Tuesday night's show. She kept the show family-friendly and, although obviously sick, looked like she had a good time." [...] Marlin Levison of The Star Tribune believed the concert lacked much profundity until the last performance.|$|E

Its 'consequences,' therefore, when investigated, always turn out to involve the 'practical' predicates 'good ' or 'bad,' and to contain a reference to ' practice' in {{the sense in which}} we have used that term. So soon as therefore we go beyond an abstract statement of the narrower pragmatism, and ask what in the concrete, and in actual knowing, 'having consequences ' may mean, we develop inevitably the fullblown pragmatism in the wider sense.|$|E

Earlier during the conflict, Russia Today had reported the South Ossetian authorities as saying that [...] "there {{was a group of}} women snipers operating in the city [...] ", and that [...] "Ukrainians and citizens of the Baltic countries have been among the prisoners they have detained."

It was then submitted to Congress for approval. On 29 November, the Senate approved the deal 75-0 and the House of Representatives approved it the next day by a vote of 130-0 despite former President Alvaro Uribe's supporters boycotting the session. Santos welcomed the resolution, while Sergio Jaramillo, the government’s peace commissioner, said: [...] "This last part of renegotiation was exhausting. It took us to the limit. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> pass to something more difficult, which is to change the conditions on the ground and benefit our campesinos. And to assure there is safe transit for the FARC and to worry about the security of communities. [...] no more political deaths in Colombia." [...] Uribe's supporters accused the government of giving away too many rights, including FARC's ability to form a political party. The deal now means FARC members were go to designated transitional zones within five days and hand over its weapons to the United Nations representatives within the next six months.

His winning time of 1:20.75 was less than a second off the track record. [...] Stevens returned as his jockey and said, [...] "That was a powerhouse performance.
