5|$|Bertram meets Raimbaut, who {{has arrived}} for an {{assignation}} with Alice. He {{gives him a}} bag of gold and advises him not to marry Alice as his new wealth will attract plenty of women (Ah! l’honnête homme). Raimbaut leaves and Bertram gloats at having corrupted him. Bertram reveals that Robert, to whom he is truly devoted, is his son; he then enters an adjoining cave to commune with the spirits of hell. Alice enters and expresses her love for Raimbaut (Quand je quittai la Normandie). She overhears strange chanting coming from the cave and decides to listen; she learns that Bertram will lose Robert forever if he cannot persuade him to sign away his soul to the Devil by midnight. On emerging from the cave, Bertram realizes that Alice has heard everything (Mais Alice, qu’as-tu donc?). He threatens her and she promises to keep silent. Robert arrives, mourning the loss of Isabelle, and Bertram tells him that to win her he should seize a magic branch from the tomb of Saint Rosalia in a nearby deserted cloister. Although to take it is sacrilege, the branch will give Robert magical powers. Robert declares that he will <b>be</b> <b>bold</b> and do as Bertram instructs. Bertram leads Robert to the cloister. The ghosts of nuns rise from their tombs, beckoned by Bertram, and dance, praising the pleasures of drinking, gambling and lust. Robert seizes the branch and fends off the demons who surround him.|$|E
25|$|I recall my thrilled first exposure, as a teenager, {{to one of}} his long-necked women, {{with their}} piquantly tipped heads and mask-like faces. The rakish stylization and the {{succulent}} color were easy to enjoy, and the payoff was sanguinely erotic in a way that endorsed my personal wishes to <b>be</b> <b>bold</b> and tender and noble, overcoming the wimp that I was. In that moment, I used up Modigliani's value for my life. But in museums ever since I have been happy to salute his pictures with residually grateful, quick looks.|$|E

He described the band as [...] "extremely style-savvy" [...] and motivated them to <b>be</b> <b>bold,</b> uninhibited and experimental. The video takes influences from styles of fashion editorial and features the Sugababes in various costumes and guises. Their outfits were created with many fabrics, in addition to newspapers, plastic bin bags and florist's cellophane. Overall, there were 13 costume changes. Scenes for the video were shot {{in a wide range of}} environments and locations, including a fire escape, loading bay, and storage cupboard.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, Radiohead singer Yorke and Radiohead {{producer}} Nigel Godrich {{expressed concern}} about how the internet has affected the music business, and accused the music streaming service Spotify of not compensating new artists fairly. Godrich stated: [...] " [...] cannot work {{as a way of}} supporting new artists' work. Spotify and the like either have to address that fact and change the model for new releases or else all new music producers should <b>be</b> <b>bold</b> and vote with their feet." [...] Mason told The Guardian that Tomorrow's Modern Boxes was [...] "born out of these conversations we had on how the internet should work for artists: the vision we both share, which is that at present we don't have a sustainable business model for artists on the internet." ...|$|E
500|$|Barrowman {{worked with}} Stonewall, a gay rights {{organisation}} in the UK, on the [...] "Education for All" [...] campaign against homophobia in the schools. In April 2008, the group placed posters on 600 billboards that read, [...] "Some people are gay. Get over it!" [...] Barrowman contributed his {{support to the}} project asking people to join him and [...] "Help exterminate homophobia. <b>Be</b> <b>bold.</b> Be brave. Be a buddy, not a bully." [...] That same month, Barrowman spoke at the Oxford Union about his career, the entertainment industry, and gay rights issues. The event was filmed for the BBC programme The Making of Me, in an episode exploring the science of homosexuality. He was voted Entertainer of the Year in 2006 by Stonewall (UK) and placed on the Out 100 list for 2008, an annual list of notable LGBT people compiled by Out magazine. In June 2010, Barrowman met with the then Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron, {{as a representative of}} the LGBT community.|$|E

2500|$|The naval command was {{thoroughly}} distrusted by General Mitre and the distrust was mutual. [...] The Brazilian commands, military and naval, suspected the Argentines {{would be only}} too pleased if the Brazilian navy was destroyed in the war, for this would weaken Brazilian power in the River Plate region. [...] The more Mitre asked the navy to <b>be</b> <b>bold,</b> the more they suspected him.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "All in all, while “Broken Heart” had its shortcomings, I {{thought it was}} a fun episode for Once Upon a Time. Everyone has their {{memories}} back, and we’re right at the point the season started. So, presumably, we won’t be getting any more flashbacks. Rather, the story will move forward, hopefully, and show us just how the Darkness and the Light will clash. Knowing Once Upon a Time, there will probably be some sort of compromise, but I think it’d <b>be</b> <b>bold</b> if the show snuffed out one or the other, just to show us what a world without Light, or a world without plot-driving evil, looks like." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{casting the}} silent comic strip {{characters}} of Peanuts, the trio pulled from their personalities. Lead character Charlie Brown's voice {{was decided to}} be downbeat and nondescript ("blah," [...] as Mendelson noted), while Lucy <b>be</b> <b>bold</b> and forthright. Linus' voice, it was decided, would combine both sophistication with childlike innocence. Mendelson recognized that the character of Snoopy was the strip's most popular character who seemed to seize [...] "the best jokes," [...] but realized they could not cast a voice for the cartoon dog. [...] "In the process, we gained a veritable 'canine Harpo Marx,'" [...] Mendelson later wrote. Melendez suggested he provide gibberish for Snoopy's mutterings, and simply speed up the tape to prevent viewers from knowing. There are no adult characters in the strip or in this special. Later specials would introduce an offscreen teacher; her lines are eschewed {{for the sound of}} a trombone as the team behind the specials found it humorous.|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} Tarkan {{in the early}} 90s was seen {{by some as a}} sign of growing admiration for Western music, and the artist's real success came two years later. Collaborating with Turkey's [...] "little sparrow", {{prominent}} producer and songwriter Sezen Aksu, Tarkan's highly anticipated second album A-Acayipsin (Oh – You're Something Else) sold more than two million copies in Turkey and another 750 thousand copies in Europe. Such high European sales were a first-time accomplishment for a Turkish performer. Aksu wrote two songs for the album, the radio-friendly [...] "Hepsi Senin Mi?", which was later relicensed as [...] "Şıkıdım" [...] (Shake) for the European market, and a pop-rock number [...] "Şeytan Azapta". [...] "Hepsi Senin Mi?" [...] incorporated shaky Turkish rhythms and lyrics of pure slang, and in the video to the song Tarkan slanted his body to the rhythmic melody of the song while displaying a naked chest. This was considered to <b>be</b> <b>bold</b> and daring in the still conservative Turkish music industry. Building on his taboo-breaking and rebellious image, the video to [...] "Şeytan Azapta" [...] incorporated scenes from the tour that followed, where dancers would strip Tarkan naked on stage. This erotic persona was enhanced when the artist posed naked and semi-naked for the most popular Turkish magazines of the period, and he became the first male to make the front cover of the domestic edition of the Cosmopolitan (Cosmo).|$|E
