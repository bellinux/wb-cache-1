5|$|The bill imposed fines {{on anyone}} who {{imported}} or traded in unlicensed or foreign books, required every book for which copyright protection was sought to be {{entered into the}} Stationers' Register, provided a legal deposit system centred around the King's Library, the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> about limiting the term of copyright. It also specified that books were property; {{an emphasis on the}} idea that authors deserved copyright simply due to their efforts. The Stationers were enthusiastic, urging Parliament to pass the bill, and it received its second reading on 9 February. A Committee of the Whole met to amend it on 21 February, with further alterations made when it was passed back to the House of Commons on 25 February. Alterations during this period included minor changes, such as extending the legal deposit system to cover Sion College and the Faculty of Advocates, but also major ones, including the introduction of a limit on the length of time for which copyright would be granted.|$|E
25|$|The Nationalist Movement Party {{claimed that}} they would {{consider}} an electoral alliance with the Felicity Party (SP) and the Great Union Party (BBP), <b>but</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> regarding the Conservative Ascension Party (MYP), which had long called for a union of nationalist parties. In the end, the MHP decided not to pursue a formal electoral alliance, but said it was open to defectors from any party. The MYP subsequently announced support for the MHP. The BBP has since decided to contest the election under the SP banner, and will thus be absent from the ballot papers. The Nation and Justice Party (MİLAD) planned to join the SP and BBP, {{but it did not}} actualise. The new electoral alliance between these parties was named the National Alliance (Millî İttifak). The candidate lists were drawn up such that BBP candidates were placed top in electoral districts in which they won more votes than the SP in 2011, while SP candidates were placed top in provinces in which the SP had beaten the BBP in 2011. This meant that an SP candidate was placed first in 55 provinces, while a BBP candidate was placed first in 30. The remaining positions subsequently alternated between SP and BBP candidates.|$|E
25|$|In {{his later}} life and career, Liao Hua {{actively}} {{participated in the}} Shu campaigns (Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions and Jiang Wei's Northern Expeditions) against Wei. One of his most celebrated moments came in Chapter 103, when Sima Yi was retreating from Shangfang Valley. Liao Hua pursued the fleeing general into a dense forest and, being a proficient horseman, was able to catch up and {{get close enough to}} strike him down. However, when Sima Yi swerved around a tree, Liao Hua missed the shot and his sword became lodged into the wood, allowing Sima Yi to escape. During the chase, however, Sima Yi dropped his golden helmet. Liao Hua took the helmet and traveled back to Zhuge Liang who rewarded him with the first grade of merit for his attempt. This event angered Wei Yan who felt Liao Hua was being unfairly praised. Zhuge Liang noticed this <b>but</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing,</b> leading to a mild distaste for Wei Yan's jealousy. The helmet was henceforth used as a means of mocking and provoking the Wei army. Following Zhuge Liang's death, Liao Hua moved up the ranks under Jiang Wei, eventually receiving the second-in-command military rank of General of Chariots and Cavalry. As Jiang Wei's senior general, Liao Hua was often tasked with the most important of duties, such as leading the vanguard and dueling enemy generals. Despite his steadfast loyalty to Shu, Liao Hua disagreed with Jiang Wei's constant invasions of Wei and his attempts to claim victory through overpowering numbers, believing these tactics to be a drain on resources and morale; he {{let it be known that}} he would run the military differently if he were in command, and this led to quarrels between Jiang Wei and himself. When Liu Shan eventually submitted to Wei in Chapter 119, Liao Hua succumbed to grief and died.|$|E

500|$|In the end, Ismay {{was named}} {{only to the}} {{position}} of Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, effective 1 August 1938. Ismay assumed the position scarcely {{more than a year before}} the outbreak of the Second World War, and the war totally dominated his time in office. Soon after Ismay took office, Hitler initiated a crisis over the Sudetenland. While Chamberlain was at the Munich Conference attempting to resolve the crisis, Ismay ordered the digging of trenches in London as protection against air attacks, should war occur. Ismay later said that he thought Britain should have gone to war at Munich instead of waiting, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> at the time. As it became increasingly clear that war was inevitable in 1939, Ismay also prepared for a [...] "smooth, simple and practically instantaneous" [...] transition from the Committee of Imperial Defence to the War Cabinet, or whatever other wartime authority the government might choose.|$|E
500|$|On 16December 2004, Farmer gave a {{press conference}} to talk about her planned {{thirteen}} concerts at Paris-Bercy in January 2006 and the release of her new album in March 2005, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> about the lead single of her next album. When this new single was announced in the media, persistent rumors claimed that the title would be [...] "Aime". In January 2005, the exact title, [...] "Fuck Them All", was eventually presented as a strong possibility by the French magazine Voici, which also provided the theme of the song [...] the war of the sexes. As noted by author and expert of French charts Élia Habib, the song title was in [...] "the language of Shakespeare, which the singer had not used since her 1992 single [...] "Beyond My Control"". At the time, many fans, however, believed that this title was a joke or a rumor as it sounded too much like a direct provocation, even a scathing insult, which was rather unusual in Farmer's career. As with other singles from Avant que l'ombre..., the lyrics were written by Mylène Farmer with the music composed by Laurent Boutonnat.|$|E

Later, MacDonald was received by the Commander-in-Chief at St Omer and made an extensive tour of the front. Returning home, he paid a public tribute to the courage of the French troops, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> then or later of having been under fire himself.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the week}} of March 2, 1970, the {{collective}} moved into a townhouse at 18 West Eleventh Street in Greenwich Village in New York City. The house belonged to James Platt Wilkerson, Cathy Wilkerson's father and a wealthy radio station owner. James Wilkerson was on vacation, and Cathy told her father she {{wanted to stay in}} the townhouse while she recovered from the flu. Reluctantly, James Wilkerson agreed. During the first few days in the townhouse, Robbins conceived a plan to bomb an officers' dance at Fort Dix in New Jersey. Jacobs was embarrassed by Robbins' ranting about attacking a [...] "strategic target" [...] like a dance, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b> According to other members of Weatherman who spoke with the group at the time, Robbins had lost touch with reality, and {{the other members of the}} group seemed incapable of making decisions.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the villagers}} fled to {{the nearby town of}} Fureidis and {{territory}} protected by the Arab League in the Triangle region near to what was to become the Green Line. Women prisoners were taken to Fureidis, which had already surrendered. On May 31, 1948, Bechor Shitrit, Minister of Minority Affairs of the Provisional government of Israel, sought permission to evict the Tantura women from Fureidis due to overcrowding, lack of sanitation, and the risk of information being passed to unconquered villages. A Ministry official, Ya'akov Epstein of Zikhron Ya'akov, who visited Tantura shortly after the operation, reported seeing bodies, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> of a massacre. In 1998, Yahya Al Yahya published a book on Tantura recording the names of 52 dead. The occupation of the village was followed by looting. Some of the items recovered by the Haganah included 'one carpet, one gramophone ... one basket with cucumbers ... one goat'.|$|E
2500|$|Kelly {{was to be}} hanged on 11 November 1880 at the Melbourne Gaol. Earlier that day, Mr. Castieau, the {{governor}} of the gaol, informed the condemned man that the hour of execution had been fixed at ten o'clock. Kelly's leg-irons were removed, and after a short time he was marched out. He was submissive on the way, and when passing the gaol's flower beds, he remarked [...] "what a nice little garden", <b>but</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> further until reaching the Press room, where he remained until the arrival of chaplain Dean Donaghy. Accounts differ about Kelly's last words. Some newspaper reporters wrote that his last words were [...] "Such is life", while other newspapers recorded that this was his response when the warden told him of the intended hour of his execution, earlier that day. The Argus wrote that Kelly's last words were, [...] "Ah, well, I suppose it has come to this", as the rope was placed round his neck. According to another account, Kelly intended to make a speech, but [...] "made no audible sound." [...] The warden later wrote that Kelly, when prompted to say his last words, mumbled something that was too quiet to discern.|$|E

2500|$|From April 1950 until June 1952, Kenan wrote a satirical {{column in}} Haaretz called [...] "Uzi & Co.", {{succeeding}} [...] Benjamin Tammuz, {{who had started}} the column in 1948. [...] "Uzi & Co.", regarded as the first anti-establishment column in Israel, took particular aim at the religious establishment. In 1952, Kenan was arrested, along with his friend and former Lehi colleague Shaltiel Ben-Yair, in connection with an assassination attempt on Israeli Transportation Minister, David-Zvi Pinkas, {{in the wake of}} Pinkas' decision to shut down public transportation on Shabbat. [...] The two were arrested as they were leaving Pinkas' home, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> under interrogation and were acquitted by the district court for lack of evidence. However, Haaretz publisher Gershom Schocken terminated his column. [...] Kenan eventually told his wife, Nurith Gertz, as well as close friends and colleagues, [...] that he really was involved in the bombing. [...] In 2008 Gertz published a biography of Kenan in which she states this. [...] He began writing for [...] Tarzan Magazine under a pen name. [...] In 1952 Kenan's [...] "Uzi & Co." [...] columns were collected in his first book, [...] "With Whips and Scorpions." ...|$|E
2500|$|The mood aboard Bismarck was mixed. Seaman Adolf Eich was {{off duty}} for some fresh air. He climbed {{up to the}} bridge {{for as long as}} nobody stopped him. When he got there he found the {{atmosphere}} pleasant. Lindemann was shaking the hand of Adalbert Schneider for his Knight's Cross award bestowed upon him for the destruction of Hood. Lütjens also looked pleased. As the morning wore on the atmosphere changed. Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann wearing a life jacket and watched as the captain ate his breakfast in silence. He did not return Müllenheim-Rechberg's salute. Müllenheim-Rechberg also met Lütjens as the Admiral {{made his way to the}} bridge. Lütjens returned his salute as he brushed past <b>but</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b> To Müllenheim-Rechberg it seemed as if the two men most responsible for Bismarck had retreated into their own private worlds. That morning, on the 27 May 1941, Lütjens sent a request for a U-Boat to pick up the ship's war diary. In this last transmission, Lütjens included: [...] "Ship no longer manoeuvrable. We fight to the last shell. Long live the Führer". Lütjens did not hide their fate from his crew. He ordered the ships stores to be opened and allowed the crew to help themselves. It was a sign to all onboard Bismarck was doomed.|$|E
2500|$|Zamora and his six castmates ( [...] , Rachel Campos, Pam Ling, , David [...] "Puck" [...] Rainey, and Judd Winick) {{moved into}} the house at 953 Lombard Street on Russian Hill on February 12, 1994. While the {{producers}} informed the other six housemates {{that they would be}} living with someone HIV-positive, they did not tell them who it was. The first to meet Zamora was Cory Murphy, who traveled to the house with Zamora. During their trip, he told her he had AIDS. Zamora quickly bonded with his housemates. Zamora informed his roommate, Judd Winick, that he was the one with AIDS by telling him he was an AIDS educator, {{and the rest of the}} cast by showing them a scrapbook of his career as an AIDS educator. Another castmate, Rachel Campos, became uncomfortable with this, and initially distanced herself from Zamora, stating that she wanted to know how this would affect her, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> for fear of seeming intolerant. Zamora took this as an act of rejection on her part, though the two later formed a rapport in the second episode, in which Zamora addressed her concerns about his condition by educating her about HIV and AIDS. Nonetheless, Zamora later took offense at jokes about homosexuals that Rachel engaged in with David [...] "Puck" [...] Rainey.|$|E
