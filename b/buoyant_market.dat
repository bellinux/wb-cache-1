50|$|Guncotton was {{not made}} again in Faversham until 1873, when the Cotton Powder Company, {{independent}} of the gunpowder factories, opened a new plant on a remote site near Uplees, about four km northwest of the town centre. It was still within the parish, but alongside the River Swale, the deep-water channel that divides mainland Kent from the Isle of Sheppey. Deliveries of raw materials — cotton waste and sulphuric and nitric acids — could readily be made, and the product was easily dispatched by water.With a <b>buoyant</b> <b>market,</b> the factory rapidly expanded, producing each new high explosive as it was formulated. Adjoining it to the west in 1913 an associate venture, the Explosives Loading Company, built a plant to fill bombs and shells. Both plants were high-tech state-of-the-art, with a power station, hydraulic mains and an internal telephone and tramway systems. Together they occupied an area of 500 acres (two km²) — almost as large {{as that of the}} City of London.|$|E

For those, instruments like the Expert, the E.M.G. and the Cascade are a wonderful substitute for the electric wonders of today.” Francis James expands this explanation: [...] "What could be more nostalgic British colonial officers than an E.M.G. playing Elgar under the black velvet of a night on the African Veldt? It was not just colonial officers who ordered them, of course. Wherever there was a regimental mess, an embassy or diplomatic mission, a wealthy merchant or a religious mission, in short, wherever there were islands of British culture in a foreign land, there these acoustic machines would be found. The whole British Empire resounded to their beautiful voices." ...|$|E
40|$|No, it doesn’t, {{despite the}} general {{perception}} that illiquidity matters in real estates. As expected, the illiquidity costs we estimate for the US residential properties are large.

However, when amortized by holding periods, monthly illiquidity costs are on average 0. 08 %, and illiquidity risk {{does not appear to}} be priced in residential properties: illiquid properties do not show higher returns than liquid properties. On the contrary, we find evidence of flight-to-quality in bull markets: i. e., high quality illiquid properties are preferred to low quality liquid properties in <b>buoyant</b> <b>markets.</b> These results are in sharp contrast with those in equities and bonds where flight-to-liquidity has been reported when markets are in stress...|$|R

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of the {{doctoral}} dissertation empirically examines under what conditions buyout financiers establish a syndicate and how they structure those syndicates. We find significant evidence that lead financiers syndicate so as to enjoy the various benefits of syndication and establish a structure that minimizes the costs of syndication while further enhancing its benefits. Finally, chapter one provides compelling evidence that the post-buyout profitability and growth of target firms are superior when buyouts are syndicated and when these syndicates are structured to limit conflicts of interest, while further maximizing syndication benefits. Chapter two empirically investigates which investor characteristics lead financiers take into account when selecting syndicate partners to join the buyout syndicate. The results reveal that lead financiers prefer syndicate partners with whom they developed a prior relationships, either directly or indirectly, as these investors can be considered more trustworthy. Besides, lead financiers prefer investors with expertise in the target industry and also favor syndicate partners with knowledge about the legal tradition {{and the culture of}} the target country, especially when having themselves only limited knowledge about target-country institutions. In addition, financiers prefer syndicate partners who are similar in terms of cognition and status, as cooperating is likely to be more effective in this case. Chapter two finally demonstrates that these partnering choices have genuine economic consequences for target companies. Finally, chapter three empirically investigates whether <b>buoyant</b> <b>market</b> conditions in the buyout industry can at least in part explain why target-firm performance on average deteriorates for buyouts in Europe. This chapter provides compelling evidence that ex-ante <b>buoyant</b> <b>market</b> conditions explain the average deterioration in target profitability after the buyout in Europe, as the industry-adjusted change in target profitability is significantly more positive for deals executed during cold market conditions. Interestingly, target performance is still positively affected for target companies sponsored in hot markets when backed by investors with substantial knowledge about target-country institutions. status: publishe...|$|E

The broadening of India's foreign investor base, in recent years, has a bias towards hedge funds/unregistered foreign investors who invest primarily via PNs.

Pundits even suggest that Australia avoided the global recession {{as a result of this}} strong trade relationship. Trade relations between Australia and China resulted in China becoming Australia's key trading partner. The arrest and charging in 2009 / 10 of four Rio Tinto executives (including Stern Hu the head of Rio's operation in China) based in China raised fears of posing a strain on this vital economic relationship. Moreover China's inability to takeover Rio Tinto and the significance and consequences of this incident are at the core of this paper. How do these events reflect the uncertainties of doing business in China or do these events demonstrate China's sovereign right to enforce anti-corruption legislation?

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the Price Earnings Growth ratio as a valuation tool has been a topical debate amongst analysts ever since being popularised by Lynch (1989). This study examines {{the appropriateness of the}} fair value criteria of a PEG of 1, 0, as proposed by Lynch (PEGL), and compares this with the time-series based, share specific model, proposed by Trombley (2008) (PEGT). In addition, the study analyses several factors which influence the accuracy of analyst's forecasts (viz. the number of analysts' contributions, the dispersion of forecasts and the forecast horizon), with the objective of identifying an optimal trading rule based on the PEG ratio. We find consistent outperformance of the PEGT model. We also note (unexpectedly) that analyst's forecasting accuracy may have a less significant impact on the usefulness of the PEG ratio than their optimism. Finally, we report an optimised PEG trading rule which delivered annual abnormal returns of 13, 7 % over the study period. The trading rule appeared to single out small-capitalisation firms, with above market growth prospects, which performed well in a <b>buoyant</b> <b>market.</b> [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Housing {{provision}} in China has undergone significant changes since economic reform. In the {{early stage of}} reform the objective was {{to solve the problems}} that are internal to the socialist economy, namely unrecoverable housing investment and housing shortages. The state adopted policies to 'commodify' and 'decentralise' housing provision. The mode of provision was transformed from a centrally allocated budget to shared investment contributed by state work-units, local governments, and individual households. Since the 1990 s Chinese cities have seen increased foreign investment in real estate development and consequently experienced an unprecedented building boom. Little is know about the impacts of globalisation on housing development. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the changes in housing investment and to highlight the dilemma of housing 'commodification' in the process of globalisation. Specifically, foreign investment contributed to initial capital formation in real estate development and more importantly helped to create a marketised housing segment. The <b>buoyant</b> <b>market</b> price demonstrated the profitability of real estate, thus attracting more capital into housing development. The combined effect of marketisation and globalisation has led to increasing social spatial differentiation and inadequate housing provision to marginal social groups. ...|$|E
40|$|Colin Jones uses advertiser-newssheets {{known as}} the Affiches to explore the worlds of medical {{consumerism}} and entrepreneurism in the last decades of the ancien regime. In a clever and compelling analysis, he describes a <b>buoyant</b> <b>market</b> for health goods and services that was exploited {{not only by the}} denizens of a Parisian ''Quack Street'' but also by individuals well ensconced within the ancien regime's medical establishment. Jones's reading of these newssheets leads him to argue that the prerevolutionary press served as a vehicle for consumer and entrepreneur self-awareness. He finds in their pages a nascent political consciousness that raises questions about the idea of a Habermasian ''bourgeois public sphere. '' Jones contends that the newssheets reveal a public sphere that connects economic and cultural developments in ways that are more in keeping with Habermas's original formulation than some recent usages of the German thinker's concept. By arguing for the strong market buoyancy of the ancien regime economy, the cultural dynamism of a significant sector of the professional bourgeoisie, and the political temper of the prerevolutionary press, Jones directly challenges revisionist thinking about the origins of the French Revolution...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the issue of whether international copyright legislation is effective in curbing audio software counterfeiting. The paper finds that copyright conventions have not been effective in reducing audio counterfeiting to comparatively low levels. This result holds even when allowances are made for the duration of copyright convention membership and the specificity of the articles of the convention. Economic development is found to be the main determinant of low counterfeit levels. This would tend to support anecdotal evidence which indicates that economic development is a necessary condition for the active recognition of audio property rights by the general public, judiciary and police. It is also consistent with a view that pirate audio software, being an inferior good, has a more <b>buoyant</b> <b>market</b> in less developed economies. From a policy perspective the research would seem to suggest that the extensive efforts and copious attention to detail by legal experts has made little impact on counterfeit activity and is secondary in importance to the socio-economic environment in which these laws are being applied.

40|$|Global {{imbalances}} and the trans-Pacific imbalance {{between the}} United States and Asia in particular loom over all {{discussions of the}} need for international policy coordination. The paradox is that, to date, the influence of these imbalances has been benign. And, in turn, the fact that the influence of the trans-Pacific imbalance has been benign has limited the perceived urgency of policy responses designed to ensure a smooth global adjustment. The United States, by running a large and persistent current account deficit, has helped to sustain the growth of global demand. China, by running a large and growing current account surplus, has helped to sustain the growth of global supply. By providing a <b>buoyant</b> <b>market</b> for the exports of other countries, the United States has facilitated the pursuit of export-led growth. It has enabled emerging markets in East Asia and elsewhere to accumulate unprecedented stocks of international reserves. By providing an elastic supply of consumer goods, China for its part has moderated global inflationary pressures and allowed the Federal Reserve System and other central banks to maintain a relatively accommodating monetary stance. To be sure, these insights are not new: the idea that global imbalances have benefits not just for the Unite...|$|E
