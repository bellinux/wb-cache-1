5|$|The cuisine of Rwanda {{is based}} on local staple foods {{produced}} by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat {{more than a few}} times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.|$|E
25|$|The {{citizens}} of Lycoming County continued {{to support the}} war in various ways as numerous trains passed through Williamsport from points north and west carrying new troops to the battles in the south. Ladies' groups set up tables at the Northern Central Railway depot. Here {{they were able to}} feed and encourage the passing soldiers. The tables were heaped with various foods and drinks including cold meat, bread, fresh vegetables, buttermilk, lager <b>beer,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> variety of distilled spirits. Ladies Aid Societies banded together to roll bandages and knit socks, trousers, and shirts for the soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Several {{fairs and}} festivals {{take place in}} Cambridge, mostly during the British summer. Midsummer Fair dates back to 1211, when it was granted a charter by King John. Today it exists {{primarily}} as an annual funfair with the vestige of a market attached and is held over several days around or close to midsummers day. On the first Saturday in June Midsummer Common is also the site for Strawberry Fair, a free music and children's fair, {{with a series of}} market stalls. For one week in May, on nearby Jesus Green, the annual Cambridge Beer Festival is held. Started in 1974, it is Britain's second largest beer festival outside London. 90,000 pints of <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> tonne of cheese were served in 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Both Bacchus, as by {{extension}} {{the god of}} all alcoholic drinks, and Ceres, as the goddess covering the raw materials, were symbolic of <b>beer,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> metaphor used by van Mander placed Venus and Cupid as representing the transformative process of actual brewing, by boiling the ingredients; the fire appearing in many images was a further necessity for brewing. [...] According to Santos, at the period when the subject {{is found in the}} art of the Haarlem Mannerists, [...] "the economic life of Haarlem was mainly based on the production of beer", and brewers dominated the government of the city, having [...] "assumed the role previously played by the nobility as a leading group in the administration of the town".

2500|$|Winter {{then asked}} Die Suidwester to apologise for its attacks, {{and said that}} {{if it did not}} do so, he would sue the {{newspaper}} and its editor, Frans van Zyl. Frans van Zyl {{was a member of the}} South West Africa Legislative Assembly, and his brother Eben van Zijl was a member of the Executive Committee. The Legislative Assembly held a special night session to amend an ordinance that allowed the Administrator-in-Executive Committee to deport people from the territory. The ordinance was originally passed to enable the deportation of enemy aliens in World War II. The Ordinance was hastily amended to preclude appeal to the courts, and as soon as the amendment had been gazetted the Administrator-in-Executive Committee issued deportation orders for Winter; a priest, Stephen Hayes; the diocesan secretary, David de <b>Beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> teacher, Antoinette Halberstadt.

But I am a civilized man, I studied human rights at the Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, so I'll grant each of you a last request." [...] The German asks for a mug of <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> bratwurst. He gets it, and then the cannibals eat him. The Frenchman asks for three girls. He has crazy sex with them, and then suffers {{the fate of the}} German. The Russian demands: [...] "Hit me hard, right on my nose!" [...] The chief is surprised, but hits him. The Russian pulls out a Kalashnikov and shoots all the cannibals. The mortally-wounded chief asks him: [...] "Why didn't you do this before we ate the German?" [...] The Russian proudly replies: [...] "Russians are not aggressors!" [...] (This joke has also been used as a Jewish joke; more specifically, as an Israeli joke, alluding to Israel's being constantly afraid of being seen as the [...] "aggressor".) ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of Yale's {{buildings}} were {{constructed in the}} Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness, including the Yale Drama School. Stone sculpture built into {{the walls of the}} buildings portray contemporary college personalities such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of <b>beer</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid, deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them {{in the style of the}} Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, [...] tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon.|$|E
