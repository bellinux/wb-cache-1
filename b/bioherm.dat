[...] The stratification is maintained through the large input of ground water rich in dissolved solids to the deeper portion of the lake. [...] The difference in the dissolved solids (Ca, Mg, SO4) between the water input to the surface and water input to the deep creates the permanent stratification observed.

[...] A well-developed separation in a body of water due to differing chemistries is present between 18 and 20 m depth. The water below the chemocline is anoxic and sulfidic, and at the chemocline is a dense layer of purple sulfur bacteria which makes the water appear pink. The purple sulfur bacteria thrive in the anoxic waters and use the sulfide from the deeper water in their chemosynthesis.The color of the lake is created by the total dissolved solids (from the groundwater input) which disperse the sunlight creating a greenish color.

Basal coral biostromes, and the base of many <b>bioherms,</b> consist of platy-coral colonies “floating” in a fine-grained matrix rich in branches of red-algae. Corals with domal or massive shape, locally mixed with branching corals and phaceloid coral colonies, dominate buildup cores. These corals are surrounded by matrix and lack organic framework. The matrix consists of wackestone to packstone, locally floatstone, with conspicuous red algal and coral fragments, along with bryozoans, planktonic and benthonic foraminifers and locally sponges. Coral rudstone and skeletal packstone, with wackestone to packstone matrix, also occur as wedges abutting the buildup margins. Integrative analysis of rock textures, skeletal components, buildup anatomy and facies architecture clearly reveal that these coral buildups developed in a prodelta setting where shifting of delta lobes or rainfall cycles episodically resulted in water transparency that allowed zooxanthellate coral growth. The bathymetric position of the buildups has been constrained from the light-dependent communities and lithofacies distribution within the buildups. The process-product analysis used here reinforces the hypothesis that zooxanthellate corals thrived in mesophotic conditions at least during the Late Eocene and until the Late Miocene. Comparative analysis with some selected Upper Eocene coral buildups of the north Mediterranean area show similarities in facies, components and textures, and suggest that they also grew in relatively low light (mesophotic) and low hydrodynamic conditions...|$|R

These rocks were deposited in a shallow-water, high-energy, subtidal, tropical marine environment. Nuia and Nuia-crinoid shoals developed on this shallow ramp and the area was frequently disturbed by storms. Calathium-dominated carbonate mudmounds emerged on the Nuia and Nuia-crinoid shoals. Although Calathium dominated the mounds on a macroscopic scale, the mounds were build by unpreserved microorganisms. Calathium simply lived in the mounds and may have acted as sediment bafflers. Other mound dwellers included trilobites, crinoids, gastropods, nautiloids, brachiopods, and bryozoa. The <b>bioherms</b> of the Opd Unit represent the transition from bioconstructions dominated by microorganisms during the Middle and Late Cambrian to those dominated by sessile benthonic macroorganisms during the Middle Ordovician...|$|R

Other genera included Myriophyllum, Isoetes (indicating the formation of littoral communities) and Pediastrum. Algae grew in the lake, leading to reef knolls (<b>bioherms)</b> formed by carbonate rocks. These grew in several phases, and some were initially considered stromatolites. Some dome-shaped <b>bioherms</b> reach a size of 4 m, forming reef-like structures on terraces. They developed around objects jutting from the surface, such as rocks. Tube- and tuft-shaped structures also appear on these domes. Not all such structures formed during the Tauca episode. Similar structures have been found in the Ries crater in Germany, where Cladophorites species were responsible for their construction. Taxa identified at Lake Tauca include Chara species. The water above the tufa deposits was probably less than 20 m deep. In some places (linked to Phormidium encrustatum and Rivularia species), limited stromatolitic development took place.|$|R
40|$|The cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa {{is one of}} the few species able {{to build}} reef-like {{structures}} and a 3 -dimensional coral framework in the deep oceans. Furthermore, deep cold-water coral <b>bioherms</b> are likely among the first marine ecosystems to be affected by ocean acidification. Colonies of L. pertusa were collected during a cruise in 2006 to cold-water coral <b>bioherms</b> of the Mingulay reef complex (Hebrides, North Atlantic). Calcium- 45 labelling was conducted shortly after sample collection onboard. After this method proved to deliver reliable data, the same experimental approach was used to assess calcification rates and the effect of lowered pH during a~cruise to the Skagerrak (North Sea) in 2007. The highest calcification rates were found in youngest polyps with up to 1 % d − 1 new skeletal growth and average values of 0. 11 ± 0. 02 % d − 1 (±S. E.). Lowering the pH by 0. 15 and 0. 3 units relative to ambient pH resulted in a strong decrease in calcification by 30 and 56 %, respectively. The effect of changes in pH on calcification was stronger for fast growing, young polyps (59 % reduction) than for older polyps (40 % reduction) which implies that skeletal growth of young and fast calcifying corallites will be influenced more negatively by ocean acidification. Nevertheless, L. pertusa revealed a positive net calcification (as indicated by 45 Ca incorporation) at an aragonite saturation state (Ω a) below 1, which may indicate some adaptation to an environment that is already relatively low in Ω a compared to tropical or temperate coral <b>bioherms...</b>|$|R
