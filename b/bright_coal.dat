40|$|The {{hydrophobicity}} of {{bituminous coal}} surface {{has a significant}} effect on the separation of coal and mineral matters by flotation process. In this work, water contact angles on bituminous coals displaying different brightness in terms of specular reflectance were measured to characterize their surface hydrophobicity. It is found that water contact angle on coal increases with specular reflectance for both <b>bright</b> and dull <b>coals,</b> and the <b>bright</b> <b>coals</b> have higher contact angle and specular reflectance than the dull coals. The oxidation of coal surface will render it less hydrophobic, but has little effect on the specular reflectance. Results from petrographic analysis show remarkable differences in volume percentage of maceral groups for <b>bright</b> and dull <b>coals.</b> <b>Bright</b> <b>coals</b> contain more vitrinite, less inertinite and mineral mater, than the dull coals. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicates that the dull surface has more hydrophilic, oxygen-bearing functional groups. These results imply that vitrinite is more hydrophobic than inertinite, and should float better than the latter. The combustible recoveries of bench scale flotation tests increase with the corresponding contact angles and their relationship can be accurately described by a sigmoidal equation. The maximum combustible recovery for vitrinite is 96. 76 % under the current operation conditions. The results also indicates that in order to reach the targeted combustible recovery in flotation, the contact angle of coal particles needs to reach certain value.

40|$|Gas {{sorption}} by coal {{is closely}} related to its physical and chemical properties, which are, in turn, governed by coal type and rank. The role of coal type (sensu maceral composition) is not fully established {{but it is clear that}} coal type may affect both adsorption capacity and desorption rate. Adsorption capacity {{is closely related}} to micropore (pores < 2 nm) development, which is rank and maceral dependent. Adsorption isotherms indicate that in most cases <b>bright</b> (vitrinite-rich) <b>coals</b> have a greater adsorption capacity than their dull (often inertinite-rich) equivalents. However, no differences, or even the opposing trend, may be observed in relation to coal type. Desorption rate investigations have been performed using selected <b>bright</b> and dull <b>coal</b> samples in a high pressure microbalance. Interpretation of results using unipore spherical and bidisperse pore models indicate the importance of the pore structure. <b>Bright,</b> vitrinite-rich <b>coals</b> usually have the slowest desorption rates which is associated with their highly microporous structure. However, rapid desorption in <b>bright</b> <b>coals</b> may be related to development of extensive, unmineralised fracture systems. Both macro-and micro-pore systems are implicated in the more rapidly desorbing dull coals. Some dull, inertinite-rich coals may rapidly desorb due to a predominance of large, open cell lumina. Mineral matter is essentially nonadsorbent to coal gases and acts as a simple diluent. However, mineral-rich coals may be associated with more rapid desorption. Coal rank and type (maceral composition) per se do not appear to be the critical factors in controlling gas sorption, but rather the influence they exert over pore structure development.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the parent stratigraphy of a coal seam, i. e. its lithotype and band distribution, {{can be used to}} estimate the input and output size distributions of broken coal for a fragmentation event(s) was tested using the drop-shatter process for core. Coal breakage {{is a function of the}} inherent strength of the material, its particle size, and the amount of impact energy imparted. Coal is composed of a heterogeneous mixture of bright and dull bands, and stone, which generate different daughter particle size distributions in response to impact energy. Lithotypes and bands also exhibit an in situ thickness distribution that can be related to input and output size distributions. The results demonstrate that dull coal that is massive and strong requires more energy to break relative to <b>brighter,</b> more friable <b>coals.</b> As a result, <b>brighter</b> and banded <b>coal</b> lithotypes break into finer band components, resulting in the concentration of <b>bright</b> (vitrinite-rich) <b>coal</b> in the finer progeny fractions.

The frequency distributions of the lithotypes 2 ̆ 7 thickness estimate the feed size, and that of the component bright, dull and stone bands of the daughter particle size distribution at the end of the fragmentation process. This has implications for the prediction of size, and composition of size fractions, resulting from fragmentation events that occur during mining and handling, both of which will impact on the downstream processing behaviour of coal...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, {{unconventional}} gas resources and in particular coalbed methane have {{received a lot of}} attention to satisfy the increasing demands of energy requirements. The characterization of coal fracture networks is crucial for understanding flow in coal seams. In this study, X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging technique is used to acquire high quality 3 D images of coal at the core-scale. Coal in terms of permeability and porosity is characterized and a unique contrast agent technique using micro-CT is employed to study coal features. The technique allows for visualization of coal fractures that are not readily visible with conventional imaging methods, particularly sub-resolution fractures. This facilitates identifying and partitioning the resolved and sub-resolution fractures and consequently results in a more deterministic representation of the coal fracture system. Also, high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) methods are used for segmentation and analysis of the digital images. A unique calibration technique that captures and adjusts the fracture apertures of coal is introduced. The calibration method provides images in which the fracture network is obtained from the micro-CT images while the aperture sizes are assigned based on the calibration curve obtained from high-resolution SEM data. Furthermore, the image-based porosity estimation is validated against experimental methods, both gravimetric and gas (Helium) porosity, and the correlations between mineral contents, porosity, lithotype and permeability in coal are investigated. The results indicate that there is no relationship between porosity and permeability while there is a direct relationship between coal lithotype and permeability, i. e. the <b>bright</b> <b>coals</b> offer more permeability than dull coals. It is shown that de-mineralization of coals has significant effect in improving permeability of coal. The applied calibration technique preserves a large amount of valuable information that is neglected when non-calibrated images are used. This produces a more precise permeability result, i. e. close to the experimental permeability. Overall, the results of this study provide profound insights into the parameters that control the gas flow in coals...|$|R

40|$|Two Australian Permian coals {{of similar}} rank but {{different}} texture, one predominantly dull {{and the other}} predominantly bright, were investigated in laboratory experiments to assess changes in reservoir properties following exposure to supercritical CO (SCCO) and water. Both powdered coal (0. 180 - 0. 220 mm) and small cubes (15 mm to a side) were tested in a high-pressure (HP) batch reactor for up to 120 h. Two reaction fluids were used, each on separate sister coal samples: de-ionised water (DHO) only, and a SCCO and DHO mixture. Properties were measured before and after treatment with: high-pressure CO adsorption isotherms (storage capacity); helium pycnometry, mercury porosimetry and low-pressure (LP) CO adsorption (density, porosity and PSD effects); leachate chemical analysis for dissolved mineral matter; and water and CO permeabilities at in situ conditions during core flood experiments on an 80 mm cube. Micro and meso porosities for both coals showed significant increases after reactions with the SCCO and DHO mixture. The macroporosity decreased significantly for the dull coal, but increased marginally for the <b>bright</b> <b>coal.</b> Total accessible porosity for dull coal showed virtually no change (0. 5 %); the <b>bright</b> <b>coal</b> exhibited 3. 4 % increase from a pre-treatment total porosity of 11. 0 %.

The HP CO excess adsorption isotherms on both coals increased after treatment, varying with pressure level, coal type and coal texture. The core flood tests indicated the permeability to CO, after a waterflood stage, increased significantly. The second stage waterflood exhibited an over 600 % increase on the pre-CO first stage waterflood permeability.

40|$|Instantaneous outbursts in {{underground}} {{coal mines}} {{have occurred in}} at least 16 countries, involving both methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). The precise mechanisms of an instantaneous outburst are still unresolved but must consider the effects of stress, gas content and physico-mechanical properties of the coal. Other factors such as mining methods (e. g., development heading into the coal seam) and geological features (e. g., coal seam disruptions from faulting) can combine to exacerbate the problem. Prediction techniques continue to be unreliable and unexpected outburst incidents resulting in fatalities are a major concern for underground coal operations. Gas content thresholds of 9 m(3) /t for CH 4 and 6 m(3) /t for CO 2 {{are used in the}} Sydney Basin, to indicate outburst-prone conditions, but are reviewed on an individual mine basis and in mixed as situations. Data on the sorption behaviour of Bowen Basin coals from Australia have provided an explanation for the conflicting results obtained by coal face desorption indices used for outburst-proneness assessment. A key factor appears to be different desorption rates displayed by banded coals, which is supported by both laboratory and mine-site investigations. Dull coal bands with high fusinite and semifusinite contents tend to display rapid desorption from solid coal, for a given pressure drop. The opposite is true for <b>bright</b> <b>coal</b> bands with high vitrinite contents and dull coal bands with high inertodetrinite contents. Consequently, when face samples of dull, fusinite-or semifusinite-rich coal of small particle size are taken for desorption testing, much gas has already escaped and low readings result. The converse applies for samples taken from coal bands with high vitrinite and/or inertodetrinite contents. In terms of outburst potential, it is the bright, vitrinite-rich and the dull, inertodetrinite-rich sections of a coal seam that appear to be more outburst-prone. This is due to the ability of the solid coal to retain gas, even after pressure reduction, creating a gas content gradient across the coal face sufficient to initiate an outburst. Once the particle size of the coal is reduced, rapid gas desorption can then take place. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science...|$|E

40|$|Traditional float {{and sink}} {{analyses}} are undertaken {{to determine the}} washability of coal. Float and sink analyses are costly, require toxic heavy organic liquids and the procedure to wash and dry the float and discard fractions is lengthy. QEMSCAN {{has the ability to}} characterise particle density based on the mineralogical composition of the particle. The objective of this research is to determine if QEMSCAN is a viable alternative to float and sink analysis. Float and sink analysis typically requires coarse size fractions while QEMSCAN analysis requires samples to be crushed down to 1 mm. Any crushing will liberate minerals, which will alter the particle density distribution. Crushing a large particle generates 'puzzle pieces' of the original particle. The smaller 'puzzle pieces' have densities frequently different to the original particle. A mineralogical based particle density prediction model confirms that the float and sink analysis data used in this study is valid. The measured ash contents for the different float and discard fractions were within the expected limits. It is observed that there are a set of controls over the liberation of particles when crushed. Particles in the low float fractions (1. 6 - 2. 0 g/cm 3) comprise <b>bright</b> and dull <b>coal</b> incorporated into an 'inertodetrinite' texture. Cleats and kaolinite laminae serve as preferential cleavage planes in the lower density fractions, while <b>bright</b> and dull <b>coal</b> serve as preferential breakage planes in the higher float fractions. As a result, these phases are liberated and there is evidence to support that liberation of minerals have controls that can be identified and corrected for. Thus, washability can be determined using QEMSCAN since the significant effect of liberation can be calculated and corrected, for a specific coal type.

30|$|Singh et al. (2015 a) found a {{specific}} micro-structural relation between mineral matter and the coaly substance in Meghalaya coal. In the moderately dull coal, mineral matter occurs as superficial impregnation and cavity filling; in moderately <b>bright</b> <b>coal</b> as superficial impregnation, cavity filling, and intimate intergrowth; and in bright coals as superficial mounting and pore fillings. In Umaria and Ib valley coal, in general mineral matter is more dominant in dull bands {{as compared to}} the brighter ones (Fig.  3 d–f). The micro structural relationships between coaly substances and mineral matter in vitrain, appears as amorphous mass with conchoidal fracture or observed mainly superficial mounting (Fig.  3 a), superficial blanketing (Fig.  3 b, c), deep intergrowth (Fig.  3 d) and massive impregnation (Fig.  3 c). Saikia (2009) has reported two different morphological types of collotelinite in Assam coals. Those are of typically angular in shape and with parallel laminations. Increase in coal rank appears {{to increase the number of}} laminations and give more ordered system of stacked sheets. Particular, in Umaria coal, telinite shows cellular structures with woody matter compressed probably due to pressure (Fig.  3 e, f). In case of clarain, characterised by alternate thin bands of vitrain and durain, mineral matter occurs as superficial blanketing and cellular cavity filling. In dull bands it occurs as massive intergrowth and deep impregnations. In durain which is characterised by structureless, compact, residual ground mass, the mineral matter occurs as intergrowth and massive impregnation. This lithotype records the maximum contamination. Finkelman and Stanton (1978) found pyrite concentrated in vitrinite macerals; illite, quartz, and rutile in the carbominerite; and kaolinite in fusinite and semifusinite. Finkelman (1980) has reported sulfides, concentrated in inertinites and vitrinites. Late epigenetic minerals, such as kaolinite, siderite, pyrite, calcite, barite and silica and most commonly the aluminum silicates have been reported by Finkelman (1980) to occur in micro cleats of coal. In the present investigation, the voids are seen to be filled with clayey, sideritic and at places limonitic mineral matter (Fig.  4 a, b). Davis et al.

40|$|Cleats {{are natural}} {{fractures}} in coal {{that serve as}} permeability avenues for darcy flow of gas and water to the well bore during production. Theoretically, the development of cleat and coal-seam permeability {{is related to the}} rank, type and grade of the coal concerned. The permeability of a coal seam, moreover, may change during gas production, due to either matrix shrinkage, cleat closure or both. Matrix shrinkage and cleat closure are also affected by numerous geological factors, including coal rank, desorption character and geological setting. A method integrating geochemical and petrographic analysis, reservoir engineering diagnosis, geophysical data and production characteristics has been developed, and used to determine the initial permeability of coal seam on a metre by metre scale. This overcomes the constraint of conventional well test by refining the test intervals. The effect of coal rank, grade and type on the initial permeability of coal seams was also investigated, with the special reference to the coals of the Galilee Basin. The permeability was estimated using analytical equations based on the permeability data obtained from well tests and from cleat descriptions within the seam section. This aspect of the study showed that the coal type, rank and grade strongly influence the initial permeability of individual coal seams. Increase in ash content has negative effect on cleat development and permeability. On contrast, increasing coal rank and proportion of <b>bright</b> <b>coal</b> lead to reduction in cleat spacing and increase in permeability. Twenty three core samples collected from the Qinshui Basin in China were evaluated in the laboratory to investigate the effects of coal grade, rank and type on the change in permeability during pressure depletion. The experimental factors included the coal's geochemical properties, the permeability against changing pressure, and strain with pore pressure depletion. This part of the study fund that permeability changes with pore pressure depletion in relation to coal rank, grade and type. The strain values determined by the experiments with pressure depletion were used to identify the mechanical principles associated with changes in permeability during pressure depletion in relation to the rank, grade and type of the coal concerned. A reservoir simulation study was used to investigate the effects of desorption pressure, geological setting and coal rank on the variation in permeability under in-situ conditions during coalbed methane production, based on a study in the Hedong area, Ordos Basin, China. The simulations allowed history matching of gas and water production from 12 wells with the actual well conditions specified as the model pressure. Good agreement was achieved between the model yields and the actual production data, suggesting that the changing permeability interpreted from the simulation is a realistic representation of the in-situ reservoir properties. The reservoir simulation study found that the decreases in permeability with production exceeded the increase in permeability caused by matrix shrinkage for nearly all wells in the Hedong area. The magnitude of the decrease in permeability increases as the gap between initial pressure and desorption pressure increases. The decrease in permeability is slower in the zone closest to the fault. The reservoir simulation has demonstrated that coal rank influences significantly the change in permeability during coalbed methane production...|$|E
40|$|In a {{coal mining}} {{environment}} {{it is often}} difficult to relate the coal wash table data and analysis obtained from exploration drill core with the run of mine material being processed in beneficiation plants. This also affects the predicted yields, budgets and the resource and reserve determinations. The aim of this study is to determine whether a technique can be developed whereby a more accurate relationship between the exploration results used for the modelling, resource and reserve calculations and budgeting can be reconciled with the beneficiation results of products extracted from the resource. In a multi-seam and multi-product environment the problem of obtaining products at various different specifications for differing markets is exacerbated. Most product specifications are linked to the beneficiation environment, thus the need to determine relationships between these properties and the final products is tantamount to success. Fortunately one of the less obscure properties is the ash content of the coal. To this a host of other specifications with regard to other impurities, such as sulphur or phosphorous content, may be added, depending on the application of the end product. The physical and mechanical properties of coal however are the most important in the initial stages of the beneficiation process. Here density and particle size distribution play a major role, since, no matter which process is used in recovering various products, density separation is the underlying mechanism utilized whether it is by jig, drum, cyclones or flotation. Coal plies and particles have different relative densities, determined by maceral composition, rank, mineral content and porosity. The physical parameters of coal are mostly controlled by moisture, volatile content (in terms of aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons), ash and carbon content which inadvertently have an effect on the overall density of the raw coal. Since the majority of products required are initially specified at specific ash content, the probable relationship of ash to density would be critical in solving the greater majority of associated problems. The sedimentary depositional environment of the coal deposit would have contributed to the distribution of finely dispersed mineral matter within the coal plies. Changes within the environment, largely due to climatic events and differing flow regimes, could influence the amount of associated mineral material in these plies resulting in closely associated but differing densities within the raw material. At Grootegeluk mine two major stratigraphical units, representative of two distinctly different sedimentary environments are being exploited. The first unit is the Volksrust Formation which consists mainly of intercalated <b>bright</b> <b>coal</b> (vitrinite rich) and shale in a deltaic environment, where the coal formation is considered to be autochthonous. The second unit, the Vryheid Formation, consists of relatively well defined dull coal seams inter-bedded with siltstone and sandstone beds in a fluvial environment considered to be allochthonous. Based upon extensive studies of borehole analyses and sink and float tests, the derivation of a technique applied to the relationship of coals’ physical properties has been developed which will enhance the understanding of its behaviour in the beneficiation environment. This has provided significantly better correlation between coal washing characteristics determined at fixed densities within the analytical realm and actual beneficiation results. If adopted, this technique would enhance the credibility of resource and reserve estimations, product yield predictions and actual reconciliation of product to source, post mortem. In so doing, the results would have considerable impact on marketing, economics and life-of-mine expectancy. Already the AAD methodology applied to the grade control function in a beta-testing phase has resulted in the closest monetary value to actual production income versus the predictions provided by the geological model and the mine planning budgetary values...|$|E

It became evident that coal is not a homogeneous material but that it is composed of several elements with different qualities. The practice of coalmining had already given the first indications. The differences between <b>bright</b> and dull <b>coals</b> were evident and rather soon it was possible to bring some striking characters of the coal in connection with this differentiation. At first the researches were restricted to the real coal (especially paleozoic coals). Afterwards the researches were extended over lignites and brown coals and the same principal characters were found in these mostly younger coals. [...] . Zie: Introduction...|$|R

The {{appearances}} of the sparks in different gases {{have often been}} observed and recorded[A], but I think it not out of place to notice briefly the following results; they were obtained with balls of brass, (platina surfaces would have been better,) and at common pressures. In air, the sparks have that intense light and bluish colour which are so well known, and often have faint or dark parts in their course, when the quantity of electricity passing is not great. In nitrogen, they are very beautiful, having the same general appearance as in air, but have decidedly more colour of a bluish or purple character, and I thought were remarkably sonorous. In oxygen, the sparks were whiter than in air or nitrogen, and I think not so brilliant. In hydrogen, {{they had a very}} fine crimson colour, not due to its rarity, for the character passed away as the atmosphere was rarefied (1459.)[B]. Very little sound was produced in this gas; but that is a consequence of its physical condition[C]. In carbonic acid gas, the colour was {{similar to that of the}} spark in air, but with a little green in it: the sparks were remarkably irregular in form, more so than in common air: they could also, under similar circumstances as to size of ball, &c., be obtained much longer than in air, the gas showing a singular readiness to cause the discharge in the form of spark. In muriatic acid gas, the spark was nearly white: it was always bright throughout, never presenting those dark parts which happen in air, nitrogen, and some other gases. The gas was dry, and during the whole experiment the surface of the glass globe within remained quite dry and <b>bright.</b> In <b>coal</b> gas, the spark was sometimes green, sometimes red, and occasionally one part was green and another red: black parts also occur very suddenly in the line of the spark, i.e. they are not connected by any dull part with bright portions, but the two seem to join directly one with the other.|$|R
40|$|The Permian coals of the South Walker Creek area, with a {{vitrinite}} reflectance (Rvmax) of 1. 7 to 1. 95 % (low-volatile bituminous to semi-anthracite), {{are one of}} {{the highest}} rank coals currently mined in the Bowen Basin. Studies of the mineralogy of this coal seam have identified unusual mineralogical assemblages in the vertical sequence, with illite-chlorite assemblages resembling a metamorphic association {{in some parts of the}} seam and kaolinite rich assemblages of more normal sedimentary origin in others. A range of analytical techniques, namely XRD, XRF, coal geochemistry, polished section petrology, SEM-EDS, and 3 D X-ray tomography, have been used to investigate the nature of this mineralogical variation, including the effects of geological process on several aspects of coal petrology and geochemistry, and especially the impact of rank advance and other post depositional process on the mineralogical variation within the main coal seam of the South Walker Creek area. The South Walker Creek coal occurs in a single seam 10. 5 to 14 m in thickness, split in places, and is dominated by dull and bright (40 - 60 % bright), and dull with numerous bright bands (10 - 40 % bright) lithotypes, along with minor dull (< 1 % <b>bright)</b> <b>coal.</b> The duller lithotypes are mostly associated with a high proportion of inertinite as seen from organic petrology studies. Overall, the coal seam is dominated by inertinite (mainly semifusinite) with minor vitrinite, together with a small proportion of liptinite (exudatinite and bituminite) macerals. X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the mineral matter of the coal is dominated by kaolinite and interstratified illite/smectite in the top and bottom of the seam, along with typically a small proportion of quartz. In the middle of the seam, however, this is replaced by an NH 4 illite-chlorite assemblage, with no quartz. Diaspore also occurs in some parts of the mid-seam interval. Some carbonate minerals (calcite and ankerite) and other minerals, namely rutile, anatase and apatite, have varying abundance in the vertical sequence, but another carbonate, siderite, and also apatite, appear to be most abundant near the top and bottom of the seam. Correlation of borehole sections shows that the kaolinite-rich intervals at the top and bottom of the seam and the illite-rich zone in the middle can be traced along strike through the deposit. Intervals with abundant diaspore in the non-carbonate mineral matter, however, appear to have a more restricted distribution, bounded by faults and seam splits and limited to the structurally lower parts of the mine area. Local changes, such as assemblages with paragonite, dickite and increased proportions of I/S also appear to be associated with fault zones. The minerals in the coal represent three phases of mineralization, syngenetic, diagenetic and epigenetic. Quartz, siderite, kaolinite and I/S occur as syngenetic phases, mainly derived input of detrital sediment into the peat swamp during organic matter accumulation. Some minerals, namely chlorite, illite, phosphates, diaspore and rutile or anatase, may have formed as early diagenetic phases. Epigenetic minerals such as calcite and ankerite, as well as dickite, and nacrite, along with additional kaolinite, illite, chlorite, diaspore, phosphates and rutile or anatase, were precipitated in cleats and fractures at a later stage as a result of epigenetic activity, probably associated with fluid movement in the coal seam strata after compaction and (possibly) rank advance. The mineralogical assemblage in the seam varies both vertically and laterally, partly controlled by the presence of faults and related structural features. Integration of these and other observations suggest that the mineralogical variation within the seam resulted from a combination of processes, including the sediment input to the peat swamp during deposition, changes associated with rank advance or metamorphism, and changes associated with hydrothermal effects due to late-stage fluid migration through the coal...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} approach to coal lithotype analysis {{is based on}} a visual characterisation of coal in core, mine or outcrop exposures. As not all wells are fully cored, the petroleum and coal mining industries increasingly use geophysical wireline logs for lithology interpretation. This study demonstrates a method for interpreting coal lithotypes from geophysical wireline logs, and in particular discriminating between bright or banded, and dull coal at similar densities to a decimetre level. The study explores the optimum combination of geophysical log suites for training the coal electrofacies interpretation, using neural network conception, and then propagating the results to wells with fewer wireline data. This approach is objective and has a recordable reproducibility and rule set. In addition to conventional gamma ray and density logs, laterolog resistivity, microresistivity and PEF data were used in the study. Array resistivity data from a compact micro imager (CMI tool) were processed into a single microresistivity curve and integrated with the conventional resistivity data in the cluster analysis. Microresistivity data were tested in the analysis to test the hypothesis that the improved vertical resolution of microresistivity curve can enhance the accuracy of the clustering analysis. The addition of PEF log allowed discrimination between low density <b>bright</b> to banded <b>coal</b> electrofacies and low density inertinite-rich dull electrofacies. The results of clustering analysis were validated statistically and the results of the electrofacies results were compared to manually derived coal lithotype logs...|$|R

40|$|The {{exploration}} for unconventional {{energy reserves}} has rapidly {{increased over the}} last five to ten years. Currently, {{there are a number of}} companies actively exploring for coalbed methane (CBM) in New Zealand. This study investigates one of these prospects, the subbituminous Huntly coalfield. Coal core was retrieved from the two major seams in the coalfield, the Renown and the Kupakupa. Three coals types were identified (1) bright lustre, non-banded, (2) bright lustre, moderately banded and (3) bright lustre, highly banded. As the degree of banding increases, the average thickness of the vitrain bands increase, the amount of structured vitrinite macerals also increase and the vitrodetrinite content decreases. The Renown seam is predominantly composed of <b>bright</b> non-banded <b>coal</b> while in the Kupakupa seam the more banded coal types are dominant. On average, the Renown seam has both the capacity to hold more gas and has higher gas contents than the stratigraphically lower Kupakupa seam. Additionally, gas content, on average, was found to be highest in intervals of the non-banded coal type and lowest in the highly banded coal type. Cluster analysis found that gas content is associated with hydrogen, volatile matter, calorific value and collodetrinite. As such, gas appears to be preferentially retained/produced in the matrix-dominated material. While not causally linked with gas content, gas holding capacity showed associations with the sporinite, inertodetrinite, funginite and vitrodetrinite; of note, these macerals are highest in the non-banded coal type. Gas holding capacity is thought to be a function of coal texture. Ash yield was found to inversely affect total gas content when ash yield is > 10 %. Below 10 %, it is thought that inorganic elements are organically bound. The small angle scattering analysis indicated that inorganic matter was in the 12. 5 Å < r < 125 Å pore size range. The influence of inorganic material was more noticeable in vitrain than matrix samples and is proposed to exist as thin inorganic coatings. Total porosity of the Huntly coal is primarily composed of micropores with macroporosity only contributing a small proportion. In addition, the specific surface area of the coals is also largely contributed by the micropores. Methane holding capacity on a dry, ash-free basis showed positive correlations with both micro- and macroporosity. When methane holding capacity was considered on an ‘as analysed’ basis, correlation was only identified with macroporosity. Possibly gas holding capacity is affected by the presence of moisture blocking access to gas adsorption sites in smaller pores. Considerable variation is present in both gas adsorption and gas desorption results between drill holes, between seams and also within individual seam intersections. Gas adsorption capacity and gas content are used to calculate % saturation for a reservoir, a key assessment parameter. It was found that multiple samples of both gas adsorption capacity and gas content are required to reduce the uncertainty around the calculated % saturation (at least three of each in the current study). Additionally, adsorption isotherm samples need to be collected as fresh as possible to minimize oxidation and moisture loss. Delaying sample analysis was found to result in an overestimation of gas adsorption capacity...|$|R
