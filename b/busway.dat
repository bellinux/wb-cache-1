5|$|The <b>busway</b> follows {{roughly the}} Torrens River valley, but with {{smoother}} curves. This {{means that it}} crosses the river quite often, with either a park or a few houses on a point surrounded by the river and <b>busway.</b> This occurs a total of eight times before the <b>busway</b> reaches Klemzig Interchange {{on the north side}} of the river. The <b>busway</b> crosses the river again soon after Klemzig and passes Lochiel Park and part of the suburbs of Campbelltown and Paradise to its north between the <b>busway</b> and the river before reaching Paradise Interchange.|$|E
5|$|After Paradise Interchange, the <b>busway</b> passes under Darley Road, {{then over}} the Torrens {{for the last}} time. The terrain becomes steeper as the <b>busway</b> {{proceeds}} up along the outflow creek and past the northwestern side of the Hope Valley Reservoir. It proceeds north under Grand Junction Road, then swings east and north again to enter {{the eastern side of}} the Tea Tree Plaza shopping centre precinct, where the guided <b>busway</b> ends at Tea Tree Plaza Interchange. Most buses continue on normal roads to service suburbs further afield.|$|E
5|$|The O-Bahn <b>Busway</b> is {{a guided}} <b>busway</b> {{that is part}} of the bus rapid transit system {{servicing}} the northeastern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia. The O-Bahn system was conceived by Daimler-Benz to enable buses to avoid traffic congestion by sharing tram tunnels in the German city of Essen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Busways</b> quickly {{recruited}} over 60% of DTC's drivers by 7 November. Amid {{concerns that}} DTC {{would not be}} able to fulfil its services due to driver shortage, and with concerns over United having a free hand in Darlington if DTC collapsed, <b>Busways</b> requested an advance on their registration date. This was refused. <b>Busways</b> exploited a loophole in the regulations, and began operating free buses on their Darlington network. <b>Busways</b> called in several vehicles from its other subsidiaries, and repainted several of its surplus Leyland Atlanteans into Stagecoach stripes, notable because none of <b>Busways</b> Atlanteans were ever painted in Stagecoach livery.|$|R
50|$|Stagecoach's first {{presence}} in the North East of England came with the purchase of <b>Busways</b> Travel Services in July 1994 from its employees and management shareholders. <b>Busways</b> Travel Services Limited is now a holding company for Stagecoach North East's operations in Newcastle, South Shields and Sunderland, the three locations in which <b>Busways</b> operated.|$|R
50|$|<b>Busways</b> Travel Services was an English bus {{operator}} that operated {{services in}} the Tyne & Wear area. In July 1994, <b>Busways</b> was purchased by Stagecoach.|$|R
5|$|The South Link expansion, {{which was}} {{intended}} to replace the South Miami-Dade <b>Busway,</b> a bus rapid transit that opened in segments on February 3, 1997 and in April 2005, has plans for a widened right of way, elevated crossings at major intersections, {{as well as the}} possibility of building one additional Metrorail station at SW 104 Street to alleviate traffic and parking in Dadeland. Since 2009, the Metropolitan Planning Organization has proposed that the <b>busway</b> be opened to regular vehicle traffic by adding a SunPass toll system with the profits going towards <b>busway</b> improvements.|$|E
5|$|Services are {{operated}} by Light-City Buses {{under contract to}} Adelaide Metro. , the <b>busway</b> carries approximately 31,000 people per weekday.|$|E
5|$|The former {{trackbed}} of the Tyldesley Loopline {{route to}} the A580,within the Wigan MBC area was reserved in the Unitary Development Plan in case the rail route could be reinstated. A guided <b>busway</b> {{was built on the}} former trackbed but the proposal was not universally popular. After consultations work started on the 4.5-mile <b>busway</b> from Leigh to Ellenbrook in 2013. It has four stops, Cooling Lane, Astley Street, Hough Lane and Sale Lane and one of its three park and ride sites in Tyldesley. A pathway for walkers, cyclists and horse riders runs alongside it.|$|E
50|$|After its {{purchase}} by Stagecoach, <b>Busways</b> {{became a}} key {{participant in the}} Darlington Bus War, {{with the establishment of}} Stagecoach in Darlington. In 1995 Stagecoach in Darlington passed from <b>Busways</b> to Cleveland Transit.|$|R
50|$|In September 2003, <b>Busways</b> {{purchased}} {{the services of}} King Brothers on the NSW North Coast from its administrator. <b>Busways</b> provides services throughout Grafton, Kempsey, Wauchope, Laurieton, Coffs Harbour, Port Macquarie, Yamba, Bulahdelah, Heatherbrae, Macksville and Raleigh.|$|R
50|$|<b>Busways</b> was {{relatively}} unique amongst new Stagecoach subsidiaries {{in that it}} kept its identity for a few years, before the corporate livery was rolled out. During this period fleet names carried the new strap line 'Part of the Stagecoach Group'. On eventual adoption of the striped scheme, the <b>Busways,</b> Blue Bus Service and Economic names survived in the red Stagecoach strap lines. <b>Busways</b> was eventually dropped {{with the emergence of}} the second generation Stagecoach livery.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, the MBTA spent {{slightly}} less than $100,000 to rehabilitate the deteriorated garage and to convert the drop-off lane into a full <b>busway</b> with shelters, benches, and signage. The <b>busway</b> opened on September 9, 2003 and 21 MBTA Bus routes were rerouted from Central Square. In late 2005, the MBTA spent $168,000 for repairs to the garage roof, which frequently leaked during rain. The 1992 station was built with new concrete ties supporting the tracks connecting to the station, which proved less durable than expected. In September 2008, the MBTA board authorized a $1 million tie replacement and slope stabilization project at the station.|$|E
5|$|Lynn {{serves as}} a major hub and {{transfer}} point for MBTA Bus routes serving the North Shore area. All routes pull into the station <b>busway</b> off Route 1A, though some can be caught at Central Square via the station's Exchange Street/Central Square entrance as well.|$|E
5|$|Lothian Buses' {{services}} have been integrated with Edinburgh Trams, since the trams commenced operation in 2014 – both {{are owned by}} the council, and Lothian Buses services interchange with the trams at various locations. The now closed guided <b>busway</b> element of Fastlink formed part of phase 1a of the tram permanent way.|$|E
50|$|Region 1 {{was formed}} in October 2006. At the time, local bus {{services}} were provided by three private operators, <b>Busways,</b> Westbus and Hawkesbury Valley Bus and Coach Service. The three operators formed the Area 1 Management Company to service the region. In late 2012, following a competitive tender process, the region’s bus contract was awarded to <b>Busways</b> alone. At present, <b>Busways</b> operates 66 local routes in the region, from depots at Penrith, Mulgrave and Glendenning.|$|R
50|$|Three bus {{services}} run {{throughout the}} region; Sawtell Coaches, <b>Busways,</b> and Ryans Bus Service. Sawtell Coaches run various services throughout Coffs Harbour city {{and to the}} suburbs of Boambee and Sawtell. <b>Busways</b> run services throughout Coffs Harbour city down south as far as Scotts Head and west into Bellingen. Ryans Bus services run throughout Coffs Harbour City and run North to Woolgoolga on a regular basis. <b>Busways</b> also operate services in the Port Macquarie region.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to <b>Busways</b> initial route network, and on commencement of driver recruitment, Yorkshire Traction withdrew their bid for DTC on 2 November. DBC {{were unable to}} reach a sale with any other buyer, and <b>Busways</b> declined a new approach.|$|R
5|$|When {{plans for}} Runcorn New Town were drawn up, they {{included}} three distinct types of road: local roads, expressways and the <b>Busway.</b> The expressways {{are intended to}} keep all through traffic off the local roads. This system links to the north by the A533 over the Silver Jubilee Bridge to Widnes and Merseyside, to the northeast to Warrington by the A56, to the east to Northwich and north Cheshire by the A533, and to the southeast by the A557 to the M56 and to Frodsham. The M56 links to the M6 and, {{to the north of}} Widnes, the A557 links to the M62. The <b>Busway</b> is a system of roads for use by buses only, and bears no resemblance to guided busways or bus lanes in use elsewhere, as it is a totally separate road system, not running alongside (or down the middle of) existing roads. In addition, there is a network of dedicated cycleways in the town.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} {{section is}} being constructed {{at the city}} end that will {{reduce the number of}} congested intersections buses must traverse to enter the Adelaide city centre; this is due to open in late 2017. The development of the O-Bahn <b>busway</b> {{led to the development of}} the Torrens Linear Park from a run-down urban drain into an attractive public open space. It has also triggered urban development around the north-eastern terminus at Modbury.|$|E
5|$|From {{its source}} the river flows westwards through Birdwood and Gumeracha. It then {{continues}} down through Torrens Gorge entering suburban Adelaide at Athelstone {{with some of}} its path paralleled by the O-Bahn <b>Busway.</b> It passes between the city-centre and North Adelaide, forming the Torrens Lake between the Adelaide Zoo and a weir opposite Adelaide Gaol. The river then continues the remaining eight kilometres to the sea at Henley Beach South, emptying into Gulf St Vincent via a constructed outlet.|$|E
50|$|When the Parramatta - Rouse Hill {{section of}} the North-West T-way opened on 10 March 2007, routes 730 (renumbered T63) and 735 (renumbered 616, now 616X) were {{transferred}} from <b>Busways</b> to Hillsbus with route 718 transferred from Hillsbus to <b>Busways.</b>|$|R
50|$|In early 1994 {{independent}} <b>Busways</b> had {{explored the}} possibility of entering into the Darlington market, as a possible option for expansion. This was shelved as bids from major groups for the <b>Busways</b> company were considered. <b>Busways</b> were sold to Stagecoach Group in July 1994. After a meeting with Stagecoach executives, {{the decision was made}} to enter Darlington, either through a bid for DTC, or as a new operator. Accordingly, <b>Busways</b> as a subsidiary company set up Stagecoach Darlington, and registered a small network in Darlington in September 1994, due to start in December, as a result of concerns over availability of drivers. Exclusive bids for DTC by Stagecoach had been previously declined.|$|R

5|$|Most {{outbound}} O-Bahn bus routes {{travel through}} the Adelaide city centre along Grenfell Street, left onto East Terrace, right onto Rundle Road through the Adelaide park lands {{to the north of}} Rymill Park, then left onto Dequetteville Terrace, which changes name to Hackney Road at the next major intersection. The Adelaide Botanic Garden is then on the left, followed by Botanic Park before the road crosses a bridge over the River Torrens. Soon after here, the two carriageways of the city ring route separate and swing to the northwest past North Adelaide, and the northbound entrance to the O-Bahn <b>busway</b> leaves the right hand side of the surface road and dips under the southbound carriageway to join the inbound track, both heading northeast. This on-street route will change when the O-Bahn City Access Project (see below) opens at the end of 2017. That will provide a 670 metre guided <b>busway</b> tunnel straight on from Grenfell Street, passing under Rymill Park and Rundle Road to surface for a short distance of on-road running on Hackney Road.|$|E
5|$|SODO Station is {{situated}} along the SODO <b>Busway</b> in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle. The entrances to its two side platforms {{is located at}} the intersection of the SODO <b>Busway</b> and South Lander Street, adjacent to a United States Postal Service parking garage. The area surrounding the station consists of a mixture of industrial and low-density commercial areas without residences, employing over 12,000 workers. Major employers in the area include Starbucks, who has their headquarters at the Starbucks Center five blocks west of the station, and Seattle Public Schools at the John Stanford Center. The light rail line is paralleled to the east by a mixed-use bicycle trail called the SODO Trail, which connects SODO Station to Stadium station at South Royal Brougham Way. The Seattle Department of Transportation plans to extend the trail to Spokane Street, connecting it to a bike trail on the Spokane Street Viaduct, serving West Seattle; a connector trail on Forest Street to a segregated cycletrack on Airport Way is also being considered.|$|E
5|$|SODO is a {{light rail}} station located in Seattle, Washington. It is {{situated}} between the Beacon Hill and Stadium stations on the Central Link line, which runs from Seattle–Tacoma International Airport to Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington {{as part of the}} Link Light Rail system. The station consists of two at-grade side platforms at the intersection of the SODO <b>Busway</b> and South Lander Street in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle.|$|E
50|$|In January 1994, {{employee}} owned <b>Busways</b> {{had been}} considering expanding in the Darlington area, although by March {{this study was}} suspended while other possible futures were being considered. In the months following the Stagecoach takeover, the <b>Busways</b> subsidiary was {{a key player in}} the Darlington Bus War.|$|R
50|$|On 14 July 2014, CDC Victoria {{launched}} a new website for its four Victorian subsidiaries: Westrans, Eastrans, Benders <b>Busways</b> and Davis Bus Lines. Benders <b>Busways</b> was renamed as CDC Geelong and Davis Bus Lines to CDC Ballarat. Soon after, Westrans and Eastrans were rebranded as CDC Melbourne.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Busways</b> Travel Services name {{still exists}} as the legal entity behind Stagecoach North East. Buses are liveried as Stagecoach in Newcastle/Sunderland/South Shields. The <b>Busways</b> travel shops in Newcastle {{have since been}} closed. Byker Bus depot has been {{demolished}} and replaced by a brand new facility at Walkergate.|$|R
5|$|Stadium is a {{light rail}} station located in Seattle, Washington. It is {{situated}} between the SODO and International District/Chinatown stations on the Central Link line, which runs from Seattle–Tacoma International Airport to Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington {{as part of the}} Link light rail system. The station consists of an at-grade island platform at the intersection of the SODO <b>Busway</b> and South Royal Brougham Way in the SODO neighborhood of Seattle, adjacent to CenturyLink Field and Safeco Field.|$|E
5|$|The O-Bahn {{had more}} than 4million {{passenger}} trips in the year after completion of Stage 1 in 1986, with a 30% increase the following year. When the completed O-Bahn was opened on 20 August 1989, passenger numbers rose another 17%. The Adelaide public transport system was privatised in the 1990s and overall patronage across all systems (bus, rail and tram) dropped 25%. The exception to this was the O-Bahn with no decrease, and there were 19,500 passenger trips daily in 1996 (7.13million a year). , the <b>busway</b> carries approximately 31,000 people per weekday.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the nearly-40-year-old {{station and the}} older {{platforms}} were crumbling. Since the Newburyport/Rockport line {{was no longer a}} freight clearance route past the General Electric plant in West Lynn, a full-length high-level platform was built to replace the 1952 platforms. The wide platform occupies the width of one former island platform plus one track slot, with the line's two current tracks on each side. The 800-foot-long platform is located west of the older low platforms, which are still extant on the viaduct. A 930-space parking garage with a drop-off lane was built off Market Street; buses continued to use the former <b>busway</b> on Mount Vernon Street at Central Square. Entrances to the platform are available from the garage and from Central Square. The new facility opened on January 21, 1992.|$|E
50|$|It {{stated that}} while {{registration}} of routes and recruitment of competitors drivers was {{not against the}} spirit of deregulation, it commented that the scale of <b>Busways</b> actions were unprecedented, and were attributable to <b>Busways</b> considerable dominance in the region, and ability to absorb losses due to free services.|$|R
