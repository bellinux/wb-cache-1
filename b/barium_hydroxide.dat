40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the rat subcutaneous tissue reaction to calcium hydroxide-based intracanal medicaments, UltraCal XS (calcium <b>hydroxide,</b> <b>barium</b> sulphate, aqueous matrix), Hydropast (calcium <b>hydroxide,</b> <b>barium</b> sulphate, and propyleneglycol), and Calen (Calcium hydroxide, zinc oxide, colophony, and polyethyleneglycol), used as a control. Methods. Forty-eight rats (Rattus Norvegicus Holtzman) were distributed in three groups: Calen, UltraCal XS, and Hydropast. Polyethylene tubes filled with one of the medicaments were implanted in the dorsal subcutaneous. After 7 and 30 days, the implants were removed and the specimens were fixed and embedded in paraffin. Morphological and quantitative analyses were carried out in the HE-stained sections. The numerical density of inflammatory cells in the capsule was evaluated and statistical analyses were performed (P>/ 0. 05). Results.

40|$|Subsurface {{demineralization}} {{of dental}} enamel during acid dissolu-tion {{has been reported}} many times, but its cause remains obscure. At first, the phenomenon was thought to result from the physical structure of enamel. More {{recent studies have shown}} that subsur-face demineralization occurs in other permeable solids, indicating that there must be more fundamental factors involved in this curious effect. In order for this phenomenon to be investigated, dissolution experiments were carried out by means of real-time scanning microradiography in various systems, including enamel, or aggregates ofhydroxyapatite (calcium, strontium, or <b>barium),</b> or <b>hydroxides</b> (calcium or magnesium). These were chosen to discrimi-nate between effects ofstructure and composition. It was found that it was not possible for the demineralization observed in these systems to be attributed to a common feature.

2500|$|Resorcinol {{crystallizes}} from benzene as colorless needles {{that are}} readily soluble in water, alcohol, and ether, but insoluble in chloroform and carbon disulfide. It reduces Fehling's solution and ammoniacal silver solutions. It does not form a precipitate with lead acetate solution, {{as does the}} isomeric pyrocatechol. Iron(III) chloride colors its aqueous solution a dark-violet, and bromine water precipitates tribromoresorcin. These properties are what give it its use as a colouring agent for certain chromatography experiments. Sodium amalgam reduces it to dihydroresorcin, which when heated to 150 to 160°C with concentrated <b>barium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> solution gives γ-acetylbutyric acid (D. Vorlgnder); when fused with potassium hydroxide, resorcinol yields phloroglucin, pyrocatechol, and diresorcin. It condenses with acids or acid chlorides, {{in the presence of}} dehydrating agents, to oxyketones, e.g., with zinc chloride and glacial acetic acid at 145°C it yields resacetophenone (HO)2C6H3~CO.CH3. With the anhydrides of dibasic acids, it yields fluoresceins. When heated with calcium chloride—ammonia to 200°C it yields meta-dioxydiphenylamine. With sodium nitrite it forms a water-soluble blue dye, which is turned red by acids, and is used as an indicator, under the name of lacmoid. [...] It condenses readily with aldehydes, yielding with formaldehyde, on the addition of catalytic hydrochloric acid, methylene diresorcin 2•CH2. Reaction with chloral hydrate in the presence of potassium bisulfate yields the lactone of tetra-oxydiphenyl methane carboxylic acid.

40|$|AIM: To produce novel {{nanosized}} bioactive glass particles with radio-opaque {{properties and}} high alkaline capacity and {{to evaluate their}} performance as a potential bioactive root canal dressing or filling material. METHODOLOGY: Flame spray-derived bioactive glass particles in the nanometre range were produced including bismuth oxide as a radiopacifier. Calcium <b>hydroxide,</b> <b>barium</b> sulphate and bismuth oxide served as controls. Corresponding materials were compressed to obtain dense specimens with increased alkaline capacity. Radiopacity was evaluated, and in vitro bioactivity was monitored using Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Leaching of bismuth was controlled using atomic absorption spectroscopy. RESULTS: Bioactive glass particles with up to 50 wt% bismuth oxide revealed radiopacity with an equivalent of 4. 94 -mm aluminium. The introduction of bismuth into the bioactive glass altered the alkaline capacity and the in vitro bioactivity only for high bismuth oxide quantities. Bismuth oxide leaching out of the glass matrix was hardly detectable. CONCLUSION: Bioactive glass can be modified with bismuth oxide to become radio-opaque...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSupercritical fluid {{synthesis}} {{offers an}} attractive and unique method to produce metal oxide nanoparticles such as barium strontium titanate (Ba 1 −xSrxTiO 3 with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1). This synthesis pathway {{has the advantage}} of producing high quality, highly crystalline nanoparticles in a narrow size range, with accurate control of the elemental composition not easily afforded by other methods of production. Coupled with moderate reaction temperatures and short reaction times, this method could be an environmentally preferred synthesis route compared to conventional synthesis pathways. This paper examines the potential environmental impacts leading from the lab-scale supercritical synthesis of 1 kg of Ba 0. 6 Sr 0. 4 TiO 3 nanoparticles of an average size 16 nm using the approach of an anticipatory life-cycle assessment. A cradle-to-gate assessment was completed, estimating the impacts across resource extraction, material processing, and production of the nanoparticles, while excluding any associated use-phase or end-of-life considerations. The life-cycle assessment highlights a number of ways by which the environmental profile of the supercritical synthesis of barium strontium titanate nanoparticles could be improved. Lab-scale synthesis was bound by physical constraints of the reactor, whereby the precursor concentration was kept artificially low. Being able to synthesize nanoparticles with precursor concentrations of 0. 1 and 1. 0 molar would reduce the average life-cycle impacts by nearly 81 % and 95 %, respectively. Additionally, the recovery and reuse of solvents at high recycling rates (e. g. 90 %) could reduce average life-cycle impacts by 56 %. At high precursor concentrations and solvent recycling rates, the environmental performance was further limited by the precursors, namely barium and titanium alkoxides, which have high upstream life-cycle demands (i. e. isopropanol production and metal processing). General impact reductions were seen as the ratio of strontium : barium increased. Further reductions could be achieved by replacing the barium, strontium and titanium alkoxides with precursors having better life-cycle profiles such as barium and strontium acetates or <b>barium</b> and strontium <b>hydroxides...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{intrinsic}} cohesive {{nature of}} micronized poorly water-soluble drug particles often promotes {{the formation of}} drug agglomerates with reduced surface areas for dissolution. The objective of this thesis was to investigate novel and innovative formulation strategies to improve the de-agglomeration behaviour and in vitro dissolution rate of a micronized model poorly water-soluble drug, indomethacin. In the first approach, various micronized poorly water-soluble excipients (including aluminium <b>hydroxide,</b> <b>barium</b> sulphate, calcium phosphate and calcium sulphate) were incorporated into lactose-based indomethacin interactive mixtures. In the second approach, the indomethacin powders were mechanically dry coated (by mechanofusion) with force control agents (such as magnesium and sodium stearate). Mathematical modelling approaches were explored using multi-exponential and mechanism-based models {{in order to gain}} an insight into the de-agglomeration and dissolution mechanisms. Dissolution of the various mixtures and coated powders of indomethacin was conducted with an automated dissolution apparatus (Erweka DT 6, Germany) using the USP paddle method in buffered media at pH 5. 0 under sink conditions. Dissolution data were modelled with multi-exponential equations via the standard-two-stage (STS) estimation method and mechanism-based models were developed by population estimation methods in S-ADAPT. Particle size distributions of the raw materials, interactive mixtures and coated powders were measured by laser diffraction using the Mastersizer S (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK). The dispersion of indomethacin mixtures was measured by laser diffraction in dissolution media under non-sink conditions. The addition of cohesive aluminium hydroxide and calcium phosphate (10 % each) to binary lactose-based interactive mixtures of 10 % indomethacin was found to counter-intuitively and significantly increase the dissolution rate of indomethacin. The improvements in dissolution for these ternary mixtures were unrelated to pH effects but associated with the ability of the poorly water-soluble excipients to facilitate the de-agglomeration of indomethacin agglomerates. Multi-exponential modelling revealed increases in the estimated initial concentration (Cd) and dissolution rate constant (kd) of dispersed indomethacin particles upon addition of the cohesive additives to the binary mixtures. Dissolution of indomethacin was found to increase {{as a function of the}} concentration of aluminium hydroxide (5 - 20 %) added to the binary mixtures. Where three particle size fractions of aluminium hydroxide (with significantly different D 90 sizes) were used, increasing the proportion of larger particles of the aluminium hydroxide increased the dissolution rate of indomethacin. Modelling revealed increases in the kd for the ternary 5 - 20 % aluminium hydroxide mixtures compared with the binary mixture, indicating larger exposed surface areas of dispersed indomethacin particles to the dissolution medium; Cd increased with both the concentration and particle size of the added aluminium hydroxide to the mixtures. Monitoring the extent of particle dispersion over time in dissolution media under non-sink conditions demonstrated an increasing trend in dispersion during the first 12 minutes for the ternary mixtures containing 5 - 15 % aluminium hydroxide; however, no change in the degree of dispersion was observed for the mixture incorporating micronized aluminium hydroxide particles. The underlying mechanisms of dissolution were elucidated and quantified by development of a mechanism-based compartmental model. A series of 5 transit compartments included into the model successfully described the slow initial dissolution rate of the indomethacin mixtures. More importantly, this indicated that agglomerates had inter-converted to dispersed particles; the mean dissolution time of the dispersed particles decreased with the addition of aluminium hydroxide to the binary mixtures. For the ternary mixtures incorporating at least 10 % aluminium hydroxide, the faster dissolution was attributed to lower mean de-agglomeration times and reduced initial concentrations of agglomerates compared with the binary mixture. This supported the hypothesized phenomenon of the role of aluminium hydroxide in enhancing the de-agglomeration of cohesive indomethacin powders. Dry coating micronized powders of indomethacin with magnesium stearate (0. 25, 1, 5 %) and sodium stearate (5 %) by mechanofusion resulted in significantly reduced intrinsic cohesion. Initial increases in the dissolution of indomethacin were found to be dependent on the concentration of magnesium stearate that was mechanofused onto the drug powders; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirmed a thicker surface coating was achieved with increasing concentrations of the hydrophobic material. The dissolution enhancing effect of the indomethacin powders mechanofused with 5 % sodium stearate was attributed to its surfactant properties that increased the dispersion of indomethacin agglomerates. Initial drug release (during the first 10 minutes of the dissolution study) from the coated powders was able to be described by a matrix-diffusion system in accordance with the Higuchi model. Application of these novel and innovative formulation strategies which demonstrated enhanced dissolution of indomethacin would greatly benefit in the development of poorly water-soluble drug formulations with potentially improved oral bioavailability...|$|R
