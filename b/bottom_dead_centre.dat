[...] Therefore, if the crank is stationary and happens to be at one of these two points, it cannot be started moving by the connecting rod. [...] For this reason, in steam locomotives, whose wheels are driven by cranks, the connecting rods are attached to the wheels at points separated by some angle, so that regardless of the position of the wheels when the engine starts, at least one connecting rod will be able to exert torque to start the train.|$|E

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{mechanism}} of ring-liner lubrication {{in the vicinity of}} the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centres</b> of an internal combustion engine. Predicting lubricant transient behaviour is critical when the inlet reversal leads to thin films and inherent metal-to-metal interaction. It was found that the cavitation, which is located at the trailing edge of the contact before reversal, briefly survives after reversal as a confined bubble at the leading edge. This depletes the film promoting starvation. Several algorithms were compared. It is concluded that the lubricant film is thinner than initially thought...|$|R

40|$|DOI: [URL] chainrings and novel {{pedal to}} crank {{interfaces}} {{have been designed}} to optimize variables related to cycling performance (e. g. peak crank torque and efficiency), with conflicting results in terms of performance. Therefore, the aim of the present article was to review the theoretical background of noncircular chainrings and novel pedal to crank interfaces and their effects on biomechanical, physiological and performance variables. Reducing internal work, crank peak torque, and time spent at the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centres</b> (12 o’clock and 6 o’clock positions, respectively) were among the various targets of noncircular chainrings and novel pedal to crank interface design. Changes in joint kinematics without effects on muscle activation were observed when cyclists were assessed using noncircular chainrings and novel pedal to crank interfaces. Conflicting results for economy/efficiency explain the unclear effects of noncircular chainrings on cycling performance and the positive effects of some novel pedal to crank interfaces on cycling economy/efficiency...|$|R

The definitive version is available at: [URL] paper provides a detailed analysis of the compression ring–bore/liner conjunction. The analysis includes ring–bore conformability and global in-plane deformation of ring fitted in situ. The analysis for fitted ring in an out-of-round bore shows very good agreement with precise measurements, using a coordinate measuring machine. The analysis also includes the lubricated conjunction under a transient regime of lubrication, taking into account combined elastohydrodynamics and asperity interactions. The transient nature of the tribological conjunction has been demonstrated, particularly the prevalent mixed/boundary regime of lubrication at the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centres.</b> The analysis is applied to a high performance motorbike engine subjected to very high impact loads and engine speeds of the order of 13 000 r/min.

50|$|The {{descending}} piston is used {{to compress}} incoming combustion air for the adjacent cylinders. This also serves to cushion the piston as it approaches <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (BDC), thereby removing some load from the bearings. The engine is uniflow-scavenged by way of exhaust valves that are operated by electronically controlled, common-rail hydraulics, thus eliminating the camshaft.|$|E

50|$|In a {{reciprocating}} engine, top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> of piston #1 is {{the point}} from which ignition system measurements are made and the firing order is determined. For example, ignition timing is normally specified as degrees of crankshaft rotation before top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (BTDC).

50|$|This is {{different}} from the design of other oval style chainrings, which have the smaller effective chainring diameter coincide with the cranks being at top and <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (TDC and BDC), thus making the crank easier for the rider to turn through BDC for a constant chain tension. By having the chainring at its peak effective diameter with the cranks level, where the rider has maximum leverage over the crank during the power stroke, these designs are supposed to make better use of the rider's power output.|$|E
5000|$|The {{displacement}} {{is defined}} as the total volume of air/fuel mixture an engine can draw in during one complete engine cycle. In a piston engine, this is the volume that is swept as the pistons are moved from top dead centre to <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre.</b> To the layperson this is the [...] "size" [...] of the engine. Motorcycle engines range from less than 50 cc (cubic centimetres), commonly found in many small scooters, to 5735 cc, a Chevrolet V8 engine, currently used by Boss Hoss in its cruiser style motorcycle.|$|E
5000|$|While the {{coupling}} rods of a locomotive can be completely balanced by weights on the driving wheels since their motion is completely rotational, the reciprocating {{motions of the}} pistons, piston rods, main rods and valve gear cannot be balanced in this way. A two-cylinder locomotive has its two cranks [...] "quartered" [...] — set at 90° apart — so that the four power strokes of the double-acting pistons are evenly distributed around the cycle {{and there are no}} points at which both pistons are at top or <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|More generally, the <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> is any {{position}} of a crank where the applied force is straight along its axis, meaning no turning force can be applied. Many sorts of machines are crank driven, including unicycles, bicycles, tricycles, various types of machine presses, gasoline engines, diesel engines, steam locomotives, and other steam engines. Crank-driven machines rely on the energy stored in a flywheel to overcome the <b>dead</b> <b>centre,</b> or are designed, {{in the case of}} multi-cylinder engines, so that <b>dead</b> <b>centres</b> can never exist on all cranks at the same time.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} and solve problems produced under the high speed operation of the high-speed mechanical press, a comprehensive optimal mathematic model of main transmission mechanism of high-speed mechanical press was established. The model takes minimum of crack length and maximum of stamping angle as the evaluation index. In the meantime, the optimal model was established with MATLAB. The optimization result shows that the stamping angle of mechanism is increased by 56. 2 %, maximum speed of main slider is increased by 21. 5 % in the return stage, and acceleration of main slider is decreased by 69. 5 % near the <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> position. The displacement curve is more smooth in the near of <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> center.

5000|$|Piston {{moves from}} crank end (BDC, <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> and maximum volume) to {{cylinder}} head end (TDC, {{top dead centre}} and minimum volume) as the working gas with initial state 1 is compressed isentropically to state point 2, through compression ratio [...] Mechanically this is the isentropic compression of the air/fuel mixture in the cylinder, {{also known as the}} compression stroke. This isentropic process assumes that no mechanical energy is lost due to friction and no heat is transferred to or from the gas, hence the process is reversible. The compression process requires that mechanical work be added to the working gas. Generally the compression ratio is around 9-10:1 [...] for a typical engine.|$|E
50|$|When {{the crank}} {{is driven by}} the {{connecting}} rod, a problem arises when the crank is at top dead centre (0°) or <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (180°). At these points in the crank's cycle, a force on the connecting rod causes no torque on the crank. Therefore, if the crank is stationary and happens to be at one of these two points, it cannot be started moving by the connecting rod. For this reason, in steam locomotives, whose wheels are driven by cranks, the connecting rods are attached to the wheels at points separated by some angle, so that regardless of the position of the wheels when the engine starts, at least one connecting rod will be able to exert torque to start the train.|$|E
50|$|The Scotch yoke is {{not used}} in most {{internal}} combustion engines because of the rapid wear of the slot in the yoke caused by sliding friction and high contact pressures. This is mitigated by a sliding block between the crank and the slot in the piston rod. Also, increased heat loss during combustion due to extended dwell at top dead centre offsets any constant volume combustion improvements in real engines. In an engine application, less {{percent of the time}} is spent at <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> when compared to a conventional piston and crankshaft mechanism, which reduces blowdown time for two-stroke engines. Experiments have shown that extended dwell time does not work well with constant volume combustion Otto cycle engines. Gains might be more apparent in Otto cycle engines using a stratified direct injection (diesel or similar) cycle to reduce heat losses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>centre</b> {{is rarely}} {{a problem for}} {{internal}} combustion engines, as these usually require cranking over to provide cylinder compression and so do not attempt to self-start from stationary. Some large stationary diesel engines, where these used a compressed air starting mechanism, have suffered from the problem of <b>dead</b> <b>centres</b> and so used a small manual barring gear.|$|R

50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, {{the drive}} utilizes a jointed rhomboid to convert linear work from a reciprocating piston to rotational work. The connecting rod of the piston is rigid {{as opposed to}} a common reciprocating engine which directly connects the piston to the crankshaft with a flexible joint in the piston. Instead, the rod connects to one corner of a rhombus. When force is applied to the piston, it pushes down; at the same time, the outer corners of the rhomboid push out. They push on two cranks/flywheels which cause them to rotate, each in opposite directions. As the wheels rotate the rhombus progresses its change of shape from being flattened {{in the direction of the}} piston axis at top dead centre to being flattened in the perpendicular direction to the piston axis at <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|E
50|$|Honda {{introduced}} several 200 cc motorcycles {{with similar}} engines but different body {{variations in the}} 1980s. The model introduced in South Africa and Pakistan {{was known as the}} CD200 RoadMaster. It had a twin cylinder 10-degree cylinder angle with a 360-degree crank shaft angle engine which meant the pistons moved together and reached top dead centre (TDC) and <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (BDC) at the same time. It was a detuned version of the Honda CD185 twin. The engine had the same bore as the CD185 but low compression pistons (8.8:1) with a bore and stroke of 53.0 x 44.0 mm, compared to 9.0:1 Compression and 53.0 x 41.0 mm for the CD185. The result was less power, a higher fuel economy and a lower top speed. The alternator system was also different from the CD185. Apart from this the models were much similar, using the same frames, suspension, wheels, tyres, and brakes.|$|E
50|$|In a {{naturally}} aspirated engine, air for combustion (diesel cycle in a diesel engine, or {{specific types of}} Otto cycle in gasoline engines - namely gasoline direct injection), or an air/fuel mixture (traditional Otto cycle petrol engines) is drawn into the engines cylinders by atmospheric pressure acting against a partial vacuum that occurs as the piston travels downwards toward <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> during the intake stroke. Owing to innate restriction in the engine's inlet tract which includes the intake manifold, a small pressure drop occurs as air is drawn in, resulting in a volumetric efficiency of less than 100 percent - and a less than complete air charge in the cylinder. The density of the air charge, and therefore the engine's maximum theoretical power output, {{in addition to being}} influenced by induction system restriction, is also affected by engine speed and atmospheric pressure, the latter which decreases as the operating altitude increases.|$|E
