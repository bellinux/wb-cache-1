40|$|Raised {{circulating}} von Willebrand {{factor is}} a recognised marker of vascular injury. To evaluate {{the role of}} vascular injury in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, serum von Willebrand factor in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, confirmed <b>bacterial</b> <b>diarrhoea,</b> and healthy subjects was measured. von Willebrand factor values were raised in 9 / 14 patients (p = 0. 007) with active Crohn's disease, 15 / 28 (p = 0. 0004) with inactive Crohn's disease, 16 / 23 (p = 0. 0003) with active ulcerative colitis, 9 / 27 (p = 0. 04) with inactive ulcerative colitis, and 15 / 17 (p = 0. 0001) patients with <b>bacterial</b> <b>diarrhoea.</b> Serum von Willebrand factor was unrelated to disease activity in Crohn's disease but was significantly raised in active (p = 0. 02) compared with inactive ulcerative colitis. In contrast to controls, the detection of von Willebrand factor from inflammatory bowel disease sera and that from fractured endothelial cells was significantly inhibited by the reducing agent, dithiothreitol, suggesting {{the presence of an}} additional dithiothreitol sensitive form of the molecule derived from injured endothelial cells in inflammatory bowel disease. That serum von Willebrand factor is raised in quiescent as well as active Crohn's disease is compatible with the proposal that vascular injury is a fundamental abnormality in this disorder. The raised von Willebrand factor values in active inflammatory bowel disease and <b>bacterial</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> could be caused by either vascular injury, occurring secondary to bowel inflammation, or to an acute phase response resulting from endothelial cell stimulation by mediators released during the inflammatory process. Raised circulating von Willebrand factor could contribute to the increased risk of thrombosis associated with active inflammatory bowel disease...|$|E

Little is known about the disease burden of CDI in sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV and healthcare associated infection have a higher prevalence and antibiotic usage is less restricted. Aim: To review published literature on CDI in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting areas for future research. Methods: English language publications since 1995 were identified from online databases (PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, SCOPUS) and personal collections of articles, using combinations of keywords to include C. difficile, Africa and HIV. Results: Ten relevant studies were identified. There is considerable variation in methodology to assess for carriage of toxigenic C. difficile and its associations. Eight studies report carriage of toxigenic C. difficile. Three (of four) studies found an association with antibiotic usage. One (of four) studies showed an association with HIV infection.

40|$|Abstract Background Campylobacter jejuni, the commonest {{cause of}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> worldwide, can also induce colonic inflammation. To {{understand}} how a previously identified heat stable component contributes to pro-inflammatory responses we used microarray and real-time quantitative PCR to investigate the transcriptional response to a boiled cell extract of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168. Results RNA was extracted from the human colonocyte line HCA- 7 (clone 29) after incubation for 6 hours with Campylobacter jejuni boiled cell extract and was used to probe the Affymetrix Human Genome U 133 A array. Genes differentially affected by Campylobacter jejuni boiled cell extract were identified using the Significance Score algorithm of the Bioconductor software suite and further analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis program. The chemokines CCL 20, CXCL 3, CXCL 2, Interleukin 8, CXCL 1 and CXCL 6 comprised 6 of the 10 most highly up-regulated genes, all with Significance Scores ≥ 10. Members of the Tumor Necrosis Factor α/Nuclear Factor-κB super-family were also significantly up-regulated and involved in the most significantly regulated signalling pathways (Death receptor, Interleukin 6, Interleukin 10, Toll like receptor, Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor-γ and apoptosis). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis also identified the most affected functional gene networks such as cell movement, gene expression and cell death. In contrast, down-regulated genes were predominantly concerned with structural and metabolic functions.

40|$|Introduction. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli {{represent}} one of {{the main}} causes of <b>bacterial</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> in humans. Although the disease is usually mild and self-limiting, severe chronic sequelae may occur, such as reactive arthritis, Guillain-Barré and Miller Fisher syndromes. Serotyping is used as an epidemiological marker, while post-infective polyneuropathies are associated with several O serotypes. Objective. Strains of C. jejuni and C. coli were serotyped based on heat stable (HS) and heat labile (HL) antigens, as well as biotypes to determine strain diversity. Methods. Campylobacter spp. was isolated using selective blood media with antibiotics. Differentiation to the species level was done by a combination of biotyping tests and by a PCR-based RFLP test. The isolates were characterised by Penner and Lior serotyping methods. Results. The serotypes showed diversity without predominant serotypes. 24 HS serotypes were detected among 29 C. jejuni strains, and seven serotypes among nine C. coli strains. HL serotyping method successfully typed 62. 5 % of strains. Among 16 C. jejuni strains 14 serotypes were detected, and three among four C. coli strains. A C. jejuni strain associated with a patient with Guillain-Barré syndrome was typed as biotype II, O: 19. Conclusion. The biotyping and serotyping results have indicated that C. jejuni and C. coli strains in the region of Niš, Serbia are diverse and could be probably of unrelated sources of origin or reservoirs. The strain associated with the Guillain-Barré syndrome patient was serotype O: 19, {{one of the}} most common in this post-infective complication...|$|E

40|$|Clostridium difficile is {{considered}} to be the most frequent cause of infectious <b>bacterial</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> in hospitals worldwide yet its adaptive ability remains relatively uncharacterised. Here, we used GeLC/MS and the exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) calculation to determine proteomic changes in response to a clinically relevant heat stress. Reproducibility between both biological and technical replicates was good, and a 37 °C proteome of 224 proteins was complemented by a 41 °C proteome of 202 proteins at a 1 % false discovery rate. Overall, 236 C. difficile proteins were identified and functionally categorised, of which 178 were available for comparative purposes. A total of 65 proteins (37 %) were modulated by 1. 5 -fold or more at 41 °C compared to 37 °C and we noted changes in the majority of proteins associated with amino acid metabolism, including upregulation of the reductive branch of the leucine fermentation pathway. Motility was reduced at 41 °C as evidenced by a 2. 7 fold decrease in the flagellar filament protein, FliC, and a global increase in proteins associated with detoxification and adaptation to atypical conditions was observed, concomitant with decreases in proteins mediating transcriptional elongation and the initiation of protein synthesis. Trigger factor was down regulated by almost 5 -fold. We propose that under heat stress, titration of the GroESL and dnaJK/grpE chaperones by misfolded proteins will, in the absence of trigger factor, prevent nascent chains from emerging efficiently from the ribosome causing translational stalling and also an increase in secretion. The current work has thus allowed development of a heat stress model for the key cellular processes of protein folding and export...|$|E

40|$|Summary The {{detection}} of diarrhoea origin in children belongs nowadays {{to a standard}} examination. The generators cause gastroenteritis. Mainly infants, but also young children suffer from intestine diseases. This disorder causes feverish conditions, vomiting, watery diarrhoea, sickness and inappetence. The aim of the thesis is to prove bacteriological and viral pathogens {{on the basis of}} cultivation. There is an outline of the most commonly occurring pathogens in the theoretical part. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> in children is caused by Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Yersiniae and Enterobacteria, whereas viral diarrhoea is caused mostly by the following viruses: Rotavirus, Adenovirus, Astrovirus and Calcivirus. The practical part was performed in the period of October, November, and December 2010 and in January and February 2011 in the Laboma Laboratory, Ltd., now Sylab, Ltd. The thesis aims at children patients till the age of 6. This age was suggested by prof. MUDr. Miloš Velemínský, CSc., dr. h. c., head of the thesis. Child´s swab rectal is used for bacteriological examination, after the transport to the laboratory it is inoculated on a selectively identifying medium and after a 24 -hour cultivation, bacteria or virus identification follows. Consequently, enteric bacteria isolation is carried out, through which a pure cultivation is obtained. In order to specify exactly Escherichiae coli, perhaps even its stems, it is necessary to perform serotype to obtain the indicated type and to find out whether it applies to a pathogenic or non-pathogenic bacteria. However, for a virological examination a child´s stool sample is needed. Rotavirus and Adenovirus are detected through the VIKIA r Rota ? Adeno test. This is a qualitative test based on the association of monoclonal antidotes. The test uses the immunological reaction on the testing stripe with help of migration. After 100 randomly chosen samples from children ? patients were processed, it was proven that acute gastroenteritis is mainly of viral origin...|$|E

Among the ETEC isolates tested, 30 were positive for LT, 3 for STh and 10 for LT/STh. Sixty-five percent (28 / 43) of the strains expressed one or more CF. The most common CFs were CS 17 (n = 8) and CFA/I (n = 8). The phenotypical and genotypical results for toxins and CFs were congruent except for CS 21 that was amplified in 10 of the strains by multiplex PCR, but CS 21 pili was only detected phenotypically in four of these strains. The ETEC strains had diverse O and H antigens and the most common types were O 8 :H 9 LT CS 17 (n = 6; 14 %) and O 78 :HNM LT-ST CFA/I (n = 4; 9 %). The analysis of antibiotic resistance showed that 67 % (n = 29 / 43) of the strains were resistant to one or several of the antimicrobial agents tested. Presence of CFs was associated with antibiotic resistance. Conclusion: The most common toxin profile was LT 70 %, LT/STh 23 % and STh 7 %. High antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin among serogroups O 6, O 8 and O 78 were the most common...|$|E
40|$|Campylobacter jejuni {{is one of}} {{the most}} common <b>bacterial</b> causes of <b>diarrhoea</b> in the industrialized world, being {{associated}} with the occurrence of Guillain-Barr頓yndrome, and inducing diseases partially through intestinal adherence. With increasing reports of C. jejuni drug resistance against standard antibiotics, investigations into antiadhesive agents for the prevention of bacterial infection are highly significant. Given the consumer-driven development towards holistic and integrative healthcare, research into additional anti-Campylobacter effects of herbal medicines that are already used for their beneficial effects on bowel and digestive functions is important. Twenty-one herbal extracts were screened for antiadhesive activity against C. jejuni using modifications of previously published antiadhesion assays.

40|$|Twenty-four {{patients}} with proven systemic sclerosis and with symptoms suggestive of malabsorption (i. e. chronic diarrhoea and weight loss) were investigated for small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Of the patients selected, six were {{suffering from the}} diffuse form of the disease. Jejuna! aspiration was performed in all patients, and in nine normal volunteers. A specially designed double-lumen sterile catheter was {{used for this purpose}} and was introduced via a gastroscope. Twenty of these patients underwent a glucose hydrogen breath test. Eight patients (33 %) had significant bacterial counts:> 103 colony forming units per ml (cfu/ml) of jejunal fluid.

Glucose hydrogen breath testing was positive in seven patients, all of whom had significant jejunal <b>bacterial</b> growth. <b>Diarrhoea</b> rather than weight loss was shown to be the symptom which correlated best with the presence of bacterial overgrowth. Ciprofloxacin was used in six patients whose diarrhoeal symptoms ceased dramatically within 48 h of commencing the antibiotic. Trimethoprim produced a partial response despite bacterial sensitivity. A disadvantage of the hydrogen breath test is that subsequent antibacterial therapy cannot be specific, as bacterial species, antibiotic sensitivity and resistance are unknown.

40|$|Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) cause {{acute and}} {{persistent}} diarrhoea worldwide, but {{little is known}} about their epidemiology in Mexico. We determined the prevalence of bacterial enteropathogens in 831 children with acute diarrhoea over a four-year period in Yucatan, Mexico. Six DEC supplementary virulence genes (SVG), mainly associated with enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), were sought in 3100 E. coli isolates. DEC was the most common bacterial enteropathogen (28 %), surpassing Salmonella (12 %) and Shigella (9 %). Predominant DEC groups were diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC) (35 %), EAEC (24 %), and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) (19 %). Among children with DEC infections, 14 % had severe illness mainly caused by EPEC (26 %) and DAEC (18 %); 30 % had moderate diarrhoea mainly caused by DAEC (36 %), mixed DEC infections (33 %) and EAEC (32 %). DAEC was most prevalent during spring, while ETEC, EAEC and EPEC predominated in summer. EAEC was more frequent in children 6 - 24 months old than in those younger than 6 months of age (P = 0. 008, OR = 4. 2, 95 % CI, 1. 3 - 13. 9). The presence of SVG dispersin, (aatA), dispersin-translocator (aatA), enteroaggregative heat-stable toxin 1 (astA), plasmid encoded toxin (pet), cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) was higher in DEC than non-DEC strains, (36 % vs 26 %, P < 0. 0001, OR = 1. 5, 95 % CI, 1. 3 - 1. 8). 98 % of EAEC-infected children harboured strains with SVG; 85 % carried the aap-aatA gene combination, and 33 % of these also carried astA. 28 % of both EPEC and ETEC, and 6 % of DAEC patients had strains with SVG. 54 % of EPEC patients carried pet-positive strains alone or in combination with astA; only this DEC group harboured cdt-positive isolates. All ETEC patients carried astA- or astA-aap-positive strains. astA and aap were the most common SVG in DAEC (3 % and 2 %) and non-DEC strains (21 % and 13 %).

40|$|Background: Shigella {{is one of}} {{the common}} genera of {{pathogens}} responsible for <b>bacterial</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> in humans. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), 800, 000 - 1, 700, 000 patients in China were infected with Shigella spp. in 2000, and Shigella flexneri is the most common serotype (86 %). Objectives: We investigated the transfer patterns of integron-associated and antibiotic resistance genes in S. flexneri during different time intervals in the city of Tianjin in the People′s Republic of China. Materials and Methods: The integrase-encoding and variable regions of the integrons of the bacterial strains were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by gene sequencing. Fifty-six S. flexneri strains, 32 of which were stored in our laboratory and the other 24 were isolated from tertiary hospitals in Tianjin during different time intervals, were tested for their sensitivity to 12 antibiotics by using the Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing method (K-B method). Results and Conclusion: Of the 32 strains of S. flexneri isolated from 1981 to 1983 and stored in our laboratory, class 1 integron was detected in 28 strains (87. 50 %), while 27 strains (84. 37 %) harboured an aminoglycoside resistance gene, aadA, in the variable region of their integrons. Class 1 integron was identified in 22 (91. 67 %) of the 24 S. flexneri strains isolated from 2009 to 2010, whereas the variable region and 3 ′-end amplification were not present in any of the strains. Class 2 integron was not found in the 1981 - 1983 group (group A) of strains; although 19 (79. 17 %) of the 24 strains in the 2009 - 2010 group (group B) possessed class 2 integron, and the variable region of the integron harboured dfrA 1 + sat 1 + aadA 1 genes, which, respectively, mediate antibiotic resistance to trimethoprim, streptothricin and streptomycin. Seventeen strains of the total 56 possessed both class 1 and 2 integrons. Strains belonging to group A were highly resistant to tetracycline, chloramphenicol and a combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; 65. 63 % of the strains were multi-resistant to three or more antibiotics. In group B, the strains showed high resistance to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin and tetracycline; 83. 33 % of the strains were multi-resistant to three or more antibiotics. Class 1 and 2 integrons exist extensively in S. flexneri, and the 3 ′-conserved segments of class 1 integron may have deletion or other types of mutations. Comparing the antibiotic and multi-drug resistance of group A with that of group B, it is apparent that the antibiotic resistance and the incidence of genes that confer multi-drug resistance have increased over the years in S. flexneri...|$|E
40|$|Background: Bacterial {{diarrhoeal disease}} among {{children}} is a significant public health problem, particularly in low and middle income countries. It {{is one of the}} most common causes of mortality and morbidity in children aged 0 - 59 months at the University the University Teaching in Lusaka, Zambia. Most of the cases are treated empirically without the knowledge of aetiological agents. There is also a paucity of data on infectious agents associated with diarrhoea, especially bacteria. Aetiological agents, epidemiological, and risk factors of associated with diarrhoea vary greatly across countries, regions and communities. Therefore, their knowledge is essential to inform diarrhoeal prevention and control programmes. Objective: To determine bacterial causes of diarrhoea, their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and identify associated factors among children aged 0 - 59 months at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods: This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study. All diarrhoeal cases admitted to the paediatrics wards at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia, from January to May 2016, which fulfilled the inclusion criteria, were recruited onto the study. Stool samples were collected from all cases immediately after their admission, and were then processed for bacteriological analysis. This involved culture, biochemical tests and multiplex polymerase chain reaction for bacterial enteropathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the identified bacteria targeting recommended drugs at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka. The Kirby-Bauer Disk Diffusion method was used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. To determine risk factors associated with diarrhoea, face-to-face interviews based on a questionnaire were conducted with mothers on the day of admission. Results: A total of 271 children were recruited onto the study, with a mean age of 23. 4 months. The number of boys was higher than that of girls, and most cases were associated with children between the ages 12 - 23 months. Vibrio cholerae 01 subtype was the most commonly detected pathogen (40. 8 %) and this was attributed to a cholera outbreak in Lusaka, followed by Salmonella species (25. 5 %), diarrhoeagenic vii Escherichia coli (18 %), Shigella species (14. 4 %) and Campylobacter species (3. 5 %). The majority of the bacterial pathogens were resistant to two or more drugs tested, with ampicillin and cotrimoxazole being the most ineffective drugs. All the bacterial isolates displayed the multidrug resistance phenotype. The study also revealed that all the diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli isolates were extended spectrum -lactamase producers. In the multivariate analysis, logistic regression showed the risk of diarrhoea to be associated with bacteria recovered from children who consumed stored water (OR= 3. 3; CI, 1. 32 - 8. 08;p= 0. 003); households not drinking treated water (OR= 2. 60; CI, 1. 16 - 6. 46;p= 0. 004); mothers not washing hands before preparing child’s food (OR= 3. 20; CI, 1. 11 - 7. 34;p= 0. 002); mothers not washing hands after handing child’s napkins (OR= 2. 01; CI, 1. 74 - 4. 69;p= 0. 006); age of the child (12 - 23 months) (OR= 3. 19; CI, 1. 31 - 805;p= 0. 003). Conclusion: Five different groups of diarrhoeagenic bacterial pathogens were associated with diarrhoea in children, and the majority of these organisms were multidrug resistant. A number of factors were associated with the <b>bacterial</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> in the children. These data call for the implementation of better surveillance and prevention programmes, as well as improvement in the early recognition and management of episodes of infectious diarrhoea...|$|E
40|$|Typical and {{atypical}} enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) {{are considered}} important <b>bacterial</b> causes of <b>diarrhoea.</b> Considering the repertoire of virulence genes, atypical EPEC (aEPEC) is a heterogeneous group, harbouring genes {{that are found}} in other diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes, such as those encoding haemolysins. Haemolysins are cytolytic toxins that lyse host cells disrupting {{the function of the}} plasma membrane. In addition, these cytolysins mediate a connection to vascular tissue and/or blood components, such as plasma and cellular fibronectin. Therefore, we investigated the haemolytic activity of 72 aEPEC isolates and determined the correlation of this phenotype with the presence of genes encoding enterohaemolysins (Ehly) and cytolysin A (ClyA). In addition, the correlation between the expression of haemolysins and the ability of these secreted proteins to adhere to extracellular matrix (ECM) components was also assessed in this study. Our findings demonstrate that a subset of aEPEC presents haemolytic activity due to the expression of Ehlys and/or ClyA and that this activity is closely related to the ability of these isolates to bind to ECM components...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} research was to determine the causative microorganisms of infantile diarrhoea, focusing mainly on Escherichia species, and making comparative study of rest ofbacterial pathogens associated with diarrhoea, as far as their identification and their reaction to different antimicrobial agents of common use. The present work methodology included the isolation, purification, identification and antibiotic sensitivity testing of bacteria which were isolated from infants suffering diarrhoea in different parts of Khartoum State, Sudan. The method adopted for native isolation and identification purposes was the culturing of faeces in differential and selective culture media such as MacConkey’s agar and Eosin Methylene Blue agar using streaking method. The purified isolates were, then, subjected for biochemical activity tests and serotyping. The results obtained revealed that, 234 isolates were collected from the 200 stool samples from infants, which were subjected to a series of purification and identification experiments. All the 234 isolates were Gram-negative rods in shape, and alone E. coliconstituted 141 of all the identified isolates. Of these isolates 34 were classified, using serotyping, as enteropathogenic E. coli, 16 as Enterotoxigenic E. coli and 12 as Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli. The yield of other pathogens was, also, detected and subjected to identification tests. The tests revealed 23 isolates ofProteus, 14 isolates of Shigella spp., and 13 isolates of each of Salmonella, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas. Also Citrobacterwas represented in 12 samples in this study. Morganellawas isolated from 4 samples. Using the disc diffusion technique the clinical strains of E. coli (141), Proteus mirabilis(23), Shigella(14), Salmonella(13), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13), Pseudomonasaeruginosa (13), Citrobacter freundii(12), Morganella morganii(4), Enterobacter(1) were subjected to susceptibility tests to different antibiotics. The results of these tests indicated that many strains exhibited multiple drug resistance. On reviewing the contemporary and current literature in this domain of research, a massive widespread of acute infantile diarrhoea was observed especially in less developed countries, where a high resistance of the causative pathogens to antibiotics was evident. Itwas, also, shown that the <b>bacterial</b> infantile <b>diarrhoea</b> infections usually occur as one product of poor personal and community hygiene...|$|R
