5|$|Mézières et Christin avec... (1983) – {{compilation}} of early work, {{including the first}} publication of the Valérian story <b>Bad</b> <b>Dreams</b> in an album as well as Mon Amérique à moi and the strips Mézières produced for Métal Hurlant.|$|E
5|$|Laureline is {{a peasant}} girl from 11th century France. In the debut adventure, <b>Bad</b> <b>Dreams,</b> she rescues Valérian from the enchanted Forest of Arelaune. When she accidentally discovers Valérian is a time-traveller, he {{is forced to}} bring her back with him to Galaxity where she is trained as a Spatio-Temporal Agent and {{assigned}} as his partner.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two albums Valérian travels through time in a {{two-seater}} device, the XB27, which transports him to the various relay stations that Galaxity has hidden throughout time (e.g. in <b>Bad</b> <b>Dreams</b> (Les Mauvais Rêves) the relay is hidden below a tavern). In subsequent stories Valérian and Laureline use the saucer-shaped Astroship XB982 (which made its debut appearance in 1969 in the short story The Great Collector (Le Grand Collectionneur). The astroship is able to travel anywhere using a spatio-temporal jump, a sort of hyperspace drive enabling near-instant transportation anywhere in space and time.|$|E

5|$|Skinner {{sees the}} old woman looking at him on a city street. However, when he pursues {{the old woman}}, he instead finds Sharon. The agents talk to Sharon, who says that the {{marriage}} failed because of Skinner's emotional distance. Scully learns that Skinner had been receiving treatment for a sleep disorder, in which he apparently had dreams about being suffocated in bed by an old woman. She fears that Skinner may have unwittingly killed Sayles in his sleep. However, Mulder believes that Skinner may be having visions of a succubus, a female demon, with the mention of similar symptoms of people's <b>bad</b> <b>dreams</b> they've experienced.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} making an {{animated}} adaptation of Valérian dates back to at least 1976. In 1982, Mézières produced concept art for an episode titled The Asteroids of Shimballil (Les Astéroïdes de Shimballil) which was later published in 2000 as an appendix to the album release of <b>Bad</b> <b>Dreams.</b> In 1991, Dargaud Films financed {{the production of a}} three-minute pilot, directed by Bernard Deyriès and animated by Studio 32 in Paris and Luxembourg, but nothing came of this venture. Several stills from this pilot episode were published in Mézières Extras. Another pilot, directed by Florient Ferrier, was made by the French animation studio 2 Minutes in 2001. Nothing came of this attempt either.|$|E
5|$|Valérian first {{appeared}} on 9 November 1967 in issue #420 of the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Pilote, and every Valérian story from <b>Bad</b> <b>Dreams</b> to The Rage of Hypsis was initially serialised in Pilote. The second Valérian story, The City of Shifting Waters (La Cité des Eaux Mouvantes), {{was the first to}} be collected in graphic novel album format by Dargaud. Since On the Frontiers, every Valérian story has debuted in album format. Seven short stories were also published in the digest-sized Super Pocket Pilote in 1969 and 1970 and later collected in Across the Pathways of Space (Par Les Chemins De l’Espace) in 1997. The series was originally published under the title Valérian: Spatio-Temporal Agent. However, with the publication of The Order of the Stones in 2007, the series now goes under the title Valérian and Laureline.|$|E

25|$|The Ojibwe crafted the dreamcatcher. They {{believe that}} if one is hung above {{the head of a}} sleeper, it will catch and trap <b>bad</b> <b>dreams,</b> {{preventing}} them from reaching the dreamer. Traditional Ojibwe use dreamcatchers only for children, as they believe that adults should be able to interpret their dreams, good or bad, and use them in their lives.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks {{shared their}} beliefs with the Egyptians {{on how to}} {{interpret}} good and <b>bad</b> <b>dreams,</b> {{and the idea of}} incubating dreams. Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams, also sent warnings and prophecies to those who slept at shrines and temples. The earliest Greek beliefs about dreams were that their gods physically visited the dreamers, where they entered through a keyhole, exiting the same way after the divine message was given.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a common}} sense of {{confusion}} between the difference of PTSD and a normal response to trauma. If an athlete injures himself or herself in a horrific way, it is normal {{for them to go}} through some adversity before overcoming the injury. They may develop small flashbacks, have <b>bad</b> <b>dreams,</b> or feel like they can't get the traumatic experience out of their mind, however, depending on the athlete’s mental ability, or how determined they are within their chosen sport, these symptoms can be lifted in time. Along with this, those athletes who are weaker mentally are the ones who tend to not be able to recover themselves and fall into the category of PTSD.|$|E

25|$|Plotting to {{kill his}} brothers-in-law, Atli dispatches {{messengers}} to Gunnarr and Högni, the sons of Gjúki, with an invitation to his hall. Guðrún, daughter of Gjúki and Atli's wife, learns about the plot and sends a runic message to her brothers but the runes are corrupted {{by one of the}} messengers, Vingi. Nevertheless, Kostbera, Högni's wife, discerns from the runes that something is wrong and warns Högni. Högni dismisses her fears but she persists and describes dreadful dreams she has had, interpreting them as warnings. Högni remains unmoved and explains the dreams away. Glaumvör, Gunnarr's wife, has also had <b>bad</b> <b>dreams</b> which she describes to her husband, who also attempts to explain them away. Eventually Gunnarr admits that their lives may be short but tells Glaumvör that he cannot evade his doom. The brothers set out to Atli with only three companions. The women follow the brothers to a fjord where their ways must part. Glaumvör reminds Vingi of the sanctity due to a guest and he swears that there is no deception. Kostbera and Högni say farewell to each other and the men row away.|$|E
500|$|<b>Bad</b> <b>Dreams</b> was {{followed}} by La Cité des Eaux Mouvantes (The City of Moving Waters) and its sequel Terre en Flammes (Earth in Flames) in 1968 and 1969 respectively. These two stories show some evolution in Mézières' art but also retain the cartoonish influences of <b>Bad</b> <b>Dreams.</b> Jean-Pierre Andrevon best sums up Mézières' style {{at this time in}} his 1970 review of the story where he describes Valérian as a [...] "kind of Lucky Luke of space-time". [...] The City of Shifting Waters and Earth in Flames were collected together in one volume in 1970 under the title The City of Shifting Waters. This became the first Valérian album – <b>Bad</b> <b>Dreams</b> was skipped because of its short length – thirty pages – relative to the usual album length of around 46 pages. Every Valérian story up to and including The Rage of Hypsis in 1985 would debut in serial form in Pilote before being published as an album.|$|E
500|$|The first Valérian adventure, Les Mauvais Rêves (<b>Bad</b> <b>Dreams)</b> {{appeared}} in Pilote in 1967, {{with the first}} installment of the story published on 9 November in issue 420, and ran for fifteen issues, concluding in issue 434 on 15 February 1968. [...] <b>Bad</b> <b>Dreams</b> shares an artistic style {{similar to that of}} Mézières and Christin's earlier collaborations for Pilote, with influences from Franquin, Morris and Mad magazine artist Jack Davis. Also introduced in this story was Laureline, a peasant girl from the Middle Ages. Originally intended to appear in only one story, the popular reaction to the character meant that she was retained for subsequent stories and she has since become elevated to the main star of the series.|$|E

500|$|The name [...] "Laureline" [...] {{was invented}} by Mézières and Christin who were seeking a name that would sound [...] "medieval" [...] and [...] "soft". The name has proven popular and there are now several {{thousand}} women in France named Laureline, the first one born in 1968 just {{a year after the}} publication of <b>Bad</b> <b>Dreams.</b> There have also been variations such as [...] "Loreline" [...] and [...] "Laurelyne". Laureline was initially created just for the first story, <b>Bad</b> <b>Dreams,</b> but recognising that they had a female character who was different from the bimbo types common to comics of the time, Mézières and Christin fell for her and, in response to positive reader feedback, retained her for the subsequent stories.|$|E
500|$|In the Poetic Edda, Sleipnir appears or is {{mentioned}} in the poems Grímnismál, Sigrdrífumál, Baldrs draumar, and Hyndluljóð. In Grímnismál, Grimnir (Odin in disguise and not yet having revealed his identity) tells the boy Agnar in verse that Sleipnir {{is the best of}} horses ("Odin is the best of the Æsir, Sleipnir of horses"). In Sigrdrífumál, the valkyrie Sigrdrífa tells the hero Sigurðr that runes should be cut [...] "on Sleipnir's teeth and on the sledge's strap-bands." [...] In Baldrs draumar, after the Æsir convene about the god Baldr's <b>bad</b> <b>dreams,</b> Odin places a saddle on Sleipnir and the two ride to the location of Hel. The Völuspá hin skamma section of Hyndluljóð says that Loki produced [...] "the wolf" [...] with Angrboða, produced Sleipnir with Svaðilfari, and thirdly [...] "one monster that was thought the most baleful, who was descended from Býleistr's brother." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which a human hair is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told you everything about this guy ... but {{you had no idea}} what he was or what he was going to do next ... you know what kind of crazy motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from <b>bad</b> <b>dreams</b> herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E
