That deal, {{which was}} the topic of that closed-door meeting with Tuohy, stated that Heirens would serve one life sentence if he confessed to the murders of Josephine Ross, Frances Brown, and Suzanne Degnan. With {{the help of his}} lawyers, he began drafting a confession using the Chicago Tribune article as a guide:As it turned out, the Tribune article was very helpful, as it provided me with a lot of details I didn't know. My attorneys rarely changed anything outright, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell by their faces if I had made a mistake. Or they would say, 'Now, Bill, is that really the way it happened?' Then I would change my story because, obviously, it went against what was known (in the Tribune).|$|E

500|$|Adams {{works closely}} with her acting coach Warner Loughlin, and credits Loughlin for helping her {{organize}} and structure her thoughts. She uses an acting method taught by Loughlin, in which she attempts an understanding of her character's psychology by creating the character's back-story {{from the age of}} three. Adams prefers to work with confident directors who give her space to think for herself. She stays in character while filming, and finds it difficult to detach herself from roles and accents. She is not influenced by the size of a role and is drawn towards both leading and supporting parts. Describing herself as an obsessive performer, Adams has said, [...] "I'm never satisfied with the take. I'll walk away from it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go and go and go. I've had to learn to be OK with it." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} {{the rights to the}} game in July 2013, NOLF {{designer}} Craig Hubbard also expressed confusion about the legal complexities behind the series.

I think Monolith actually owned A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way, the subtitle of the sequel, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be wrong about that. Fox got acquired by VUG, which in turn got acquired by Activision, while Monolith got bought by Warner Brothers, so some stars would have to align for everything to get sorted out." [...] Hubbard added that [...] "there didn't seem to be any interest in resurrecting the franchise" [...] as of 2012, while he was still working at Monolith/Warner Bros.|$|E
500|$|From 1842 Bennett {{had been}} a {{director}} of the Philharmonic Society of London. He helped to relieve the society's perilous finances by persuading Mendelssohn and Spohr to perform with the Society's orchestra, attracting full houses and much-needed income. In 1842 the orchestra, under the composer's baton, gave the London premiere of Mendelssohn's Third (Scottish) Symphony, two months after its world premiere in Leipzig. In 1844 Mendelssohn conducted the last six concerts of the society's season, in which among his own works and those of many others he included music by Bennett. From 1846 to 1854 the Society's conductor was Michael Costa, of whom Bennett disapproved; Costa was too devoted to Italian opera and not a partisan of the German masters, as was Bennett. Bennett wrote to Mendelssohn on 24 July, displaying some querulousness, [...] "The Philharmonic Directors have engaged Costa... with which I am not very well pleased, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not persuade them to the contrary, and am tired of quarrelling with them. They are a worse set this year than we have ever had." ...|$|E

500|$|Carte {{later said}} it was [...] "the scheme of my life" [...] to found a school of high-quality, family-friendly English comic opera, in {{contrast}} to the [...] burlesques and adaptations of French operettas that dominated the London musical stage at that time. His experience in writing operettas, however, had convinced him that his own creative talents were inadequate for the task. He later wrote to dramatist W. S. Gilbert, [...] "I envy your position <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never attain it. If I could be an author like you I would certainly not be a manager. I am simply the tradesman who sells your works of art." [...] Furthermore, in 1874 Carte did not yet have the resources to make his idea into reality, and after his season at the Opera Comique, he terminated his lease. In the same year, he arranged for his client, Offenbach, to collaborate with H. B. Farnie to write a new operetta on the theme of Dick Whittington and His Cat, which played during the Christmas season at the Alhambra Theatre.|$|E
500|$|The first verse of [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] implores {{the object}} of the singer's desire to walk away, because her {{emotions}} are too overpowering and she feels love of unprecedented intensity. She fears that by allowing him to stay attached, she may [...] "lose control". Selena believes that her infatuation can lead to romantic love. She then sings [...] "I could fall in love (in love) with you" [...] before wondering how she would feel if she were to touch him for the first time. The fear of being rejected and unloved leads her to keep her feelings to herself, and she begins to believe that her love is [...] "not right". She continues, [...] "and I guess I should try/ to do what I should do/ <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> fall in love/ fall in love with you". During the midpoint break, Selena sings in Spanish that she is always dreaming about him, imagining that he loves her. She sings the chorus twice before the song comes to an end without her ever having come to terms with her loved one.|$|E
500|$|From 1848 to 1864, Denmark and the German Confederation {{fought over}} control of the two duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Historically, the duchies had been ruled by Denmark since medieval times, but there {{remained}} a large German majority. This majority was sparked to rebellion after Frederick VII of Denmark announced on 27 March 1848 the duchies would {{become an integral part of}} Denmark under his new liberal constitution. Prussia soon became involved, supporting the uprising and beginning the First Schleswig War. Ernest sent 8,000 men initially, adding to the army sent by the German Confederation. He also desired to be given a military job during the war, but was refused, as it was [...] "extremely difficult to offer me a position in the army of Schleswig-Holstein corresponding to my rank", according to his memoirs. He agreed to a smaller command, coming to lead a Thuringian contingent; he commented in a letter to his brother that [...] "I should have declined any other command of the kind, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not refuse this one, as, in the present condition of our States, it is important to keep the executive power in our hands". As commander of a German corps, Ernest was instrumental in winning the 5 April 1849 battle of Eckernförde against Danish forces.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Spielberg told {{film critic}} Joe Leydon that [...] "People pretend {{to think they}} know Stanley Kubrick, and think they know me, when most of them don't know either of us". [...] "And what's really funny about that is, all the parts of A.I. that people assume were Stanley's were mine. And all the parts of A.I. that people accuse me of {{sweetening}} and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley's. The teddy bear was Stanley's. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film– all the stuff in the house– was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision." [...] "Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see why. Because, obviously, I've {{done a lot of}} movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of A.I., not me. I'm the guy who did the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else. That's why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place. He said, 'This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own.|$|E
500|$|In a May 7, 1918 {{letter from}} Tobolsk {{to her sister}} Maria in Yekaterinburg, Anastasia {{described}} a moment of joy despite her sadness and loneliness and worry for the sick Alexei: [...] "We played on the swing, that was when I roared with laughter, the fall was so wonderful! Indeed! I told the sisters about {{it so many times}} yesterday that they got quite fed up, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go on telling it masses of times... What weather we've had! One could simply shout with joy." [...] In his memoirs, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as [...] "very friendly and full of fun", while another guard said Anastasia was [...] "a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus." [...] Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess [...] "offensive and a terrorist" [...] and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks. Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.|$|E
500|$|The 1973–74 NBA {{season was}} to be West's last as a player. Now 36 years old, the veteran guard {{averaged}} 20.3points, 3.7rebounds and 6.6assists per game. In two newly introduced statistics, steals and blocks, he was credited with 2.6 steals and 0.7 blocks per game. Despite playing only 31 games due to a strained groin, West was still regarded as an elite guard, earning another callup into his final All-Star Game. Without Chamberlain, who had ended his NBA career, the Lakers won 47 games and lost in five games to the Milwaukee Bucks. After this loss, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages. West wanted to re-negotiate his contract and keep playing, however he said Cooke [...] "basically told my agent to go to hell. I felt I was deceived. When you feel that you’re deceived you don’t {{want any part of}} the organization that deceived you. I could’ve played another very good year. Every athlete says that. But I could’ve, and I knew I could’ve. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never have played for the Lakers again, and I wasn’t going to play for anybody else."

500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the Breaking Bad staff decided {{early on that}} Gus would not speak much during the scene because they felt it was more {{dramatic}} that way and more appropriate for his character. Esposito felt the scene was a pivotal moment not only for his character, but for Gus' relationship with Walter, and a warning that Walter should continue to operate Gus' way or risk death. Regarding his character's murder of Victor, Esposito said: [...] "This had to be done. Someone did something, they got seen. ... It was about survival. This had to be done, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{do it in a}} way that also sent a message to the people who weren't listening." [...] Bryan Cranston said he was not expecting the episode to take the direction it did. He called the scene [...] "painful, but beautifully crafted, and reasonably so", and commented on the contrast between Gus' calm demeanor and Walter's [...] "tap-dancing to stay alive". Cranston said of Esposito's performance, [...] "When he plays that bad character, his eyes go dead, and all it takes is to look into his eyes." [...] Gilligan said although Gus' actions in the scene were scripted, [...] "You'd be surprised how little I talked to Giancarlo about how he played that part ... This is a man with amazing instincts." ...|$|E
500|$|Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal criticized most of {{the musical}} {{performances}} in the episode, calling [...] "Run Joey Run" [...] the highlight of an otherwise [...] "slow, forced show". Flandez opined of [...] "Ice Ice Baby": [...] "Will, kicking it old school, doesn't cut it with his '80s-flashback moves because a.) he takes himself too seriously and b.) he looks like he's in a J.Crew mag, not part of 2 Live Crew." [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times wrote that he hated the episode, similarly calling [...] "Run Joey Run" [...] his favorite song, but noting that that was [...] "not hard considering the songbook that was offered". Kennedy deemed the [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] performance his least favourite moment of the entire series thus far. He concluded: [...] "Each of the musical numbers felt about two minutes longer than they should have been. I love Newton-John’s walk-on cameo, but I don’t want them {{to fall into the}} habit of re-creating music videos frame by frame: It was cute - once. It sounds harsh, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have completely done without the episode. It was almost as if they needed filler just to showcase the [...] "Physical" [...] video."
