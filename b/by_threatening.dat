5|$|<b>By</b> <b>threatening</b> the {{independence}} of the states, the interests of the nobility and the position of the church, the reforms acted as a force to unite these groups against the Austrian government.|$|E
5|$|Congress has {{sometimes}} gotten around the Tenth Amendment by invoking the Commerce Clause in Article One or <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> to withhold {{funding for a}} federal program from noncooperative States, as in South Dakota v. Dole (1987).|$|E
5|$|Low, {{like other}} pirates of the time, tried to intimidate his victims into {{surrendering}} <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> {{to kill or}} torture them. The crew of the targeted ship would hinder the officers from defending the ship, so afraid were they of reprisals. One failed torture session led to one of Low's crew members accidentally cutting him in the mouth. Botched surgery left Low scarred.|$|E
5000|$|New South Wales: Listed as [...] "Critically Endangered" [...] <b>by</b> <b>Threatened</b> Species Conservation Act 1995 as of May 2015.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat degradation. It {{requires}} open habitat for germination, but {{this kind of}} habitat is <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> introduced flora. It is also <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> introduced grazing animals.|$|R
50|$|During the Napoleonic Wars alarm created <b>by</b> <b>threatened</b> invasion, Highmore {{became a}} member of the Honourable Artillery Company. The {{secretary}} to the London Lying-in Hospital, he advocated for the public dispensary movement as more cost-effective than hospitals.|$|R
5|$|Operation Ironside formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. The overall aim of Bodyguard was to tie down German forces away from Normandy <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> other targets. Ironside's specific objective was to tie up the 17th SS and 11th Panzer divisions deployed {{in the south of}} France.|$|E
5|$|Sweet {{ruled that}} Universal had acted in bad faith <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> Nintendo's licensees {{and that it}} had no right over the name King Kong or the {{characters}} and story. He further held that there was no possibility for consumers to confuse Nintendo's game and characters with the King Kong films and their characters. Universal appealed the case, but the verdict was upheld.|$|E
5|$|The final {{disaster}} for Villiers occurred in November, when Princess Amelia died. After her death, Villiers {{and his wife}} attempted to blackmail the Royal Family <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> (in a letter to her doctor, Sir Henry Halford) to release some of her correspondence, much to the shock of her sister, Princess Mary. The family finally moved out of Cranborne Lodge in 1812.|$|E
50|$|Fourth, {{you claim}} that, {{thanks to the}} civil right, honest men can be educated, because laws promise prices to virtues and punishments to crimes. I have always thought that, instead, virtue can be communicated to men, by {{education}} and persuasion and not <b>by</b> <b>threatens,</b> violence or terror.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> livestock, which relish the semi-succulent leaves. It is also <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> {{recreational}} {{activity in the}} habitat.|$|R
50|$|Schizolaena parviflora is <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> {{deforestation}} due to shifting {{patterns of}} agriculture. The species is also <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> timber harvesting and wildfires.|$|R
5|$|This {{pay raise}} {{proposal}} was submitted as {{an amendment to}} the government's general appropriations bill. Had Grant vetoed the bill, the government would not have any money to operate for the following fiscal year, which would have necessitated a special session of Congress. However, Grant missed an opportunity to make a statement <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> a veto.|$|E
5|$|Following the Wales Test Dixon and the WRU {{continued}} to clash over referee appointments. The dispute escalated {{to the point}} where Dixon threatened {{to pull out of the}} All Blacks' remaining Welsh fixtures. The WRU responded <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> to cancel the fixtures if their referee choices were rejected. The dispute was resolved when the chairman of the RFU, Rowland Hill, got the WRU to accept Gil Evans (a Welshman from Birmingham) as referee for the final three matches. Gil Evans had refereed the All Blacks versus England Test and was well respected by the New Zealanders.|$|E
5|$|Howard {{arranges}} a {{game with}} wealthy William Jefferson Slade, who secures Shooter's services as dealer. Howard wins $6,000 from Slade over a 30-hour game, angering Slade and wounding his pride. That night at Slade's home, he tries to bribe Shooter into cheating in the Kid's favor when the two players meet. Shooter declines, but Slade calls in Shooter's markers worth $12,000, and blackmails him <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> to reveal damaging information about Shooter's wild wife, Melba. Shooter agonizes over his decision, having spent the last 25 years building a reputation for integrity.|$|E
50|$|This {{plant is}} <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> {{firewood}} harvesting, {{which has caused}} habitat destruction in the area. It may also be <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> mining operations.|$|R
50|$|Both {{species are}} listed as near <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> the IUCN. They are <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat loss, {{introduced}} predators and disturbance of their breeding habitat.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant is}} <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> the loss and {{degradation}} of its habitat. In New Mexico it is <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> {{oil and gas}} development and {{the changes that have}} occurred on the land due to overgrazing, such as erosion and introduced species of plants. In Texas, the plant grows on roadsides and it may be <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> roadway maintenance.|$|R
5|$|Shark, {{now working}} for Maxie, {{suggests}} to Danny they beat up Primont {{to help his}} father. One night when Mr. Fisher leaves the store dressed in Primont's hat and coat (lent due to a rainstorm), Shark recognizes him, but decides to mug him anyway, as that would be even better for Maxie's purposes. Danny's father is so badly injured that he needs expensive surgery; so Maxie pays for a specialist to perform it. Maxie later blackmails Danny into signing with him <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> to tell his father about {{his involvement in the}} mugging, and then does it anyway. Outraged, Danny pummels Maxie for the betrayal and helps Ronnie escape him.|$|E
5|$|To impress Jacqueline, Grampa {{takes her}} out dancing, {{but when he}} does, Mr. Burns steals her from him and breaks his heart. Mr. Burns {{declares}} {{that he is in}} love with Jacqueline, {{and they are going to}} get married, against Marge's interest. Meanwhile, Bart buys a $350 Itchy & Scratchy animation cel with one of Homer's credit cards. In order to pay Homer back, Bart blackmails Mr. Burns <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> to ruin his suit before his date.|$|E
5|$|Todd is briefly {{questioned}} {{about his relationship}} with Dussander, but he manages to convince the police that he knew nothing of the old man's true identity. At the hospital, Dussander hears a group of Neo-Nazis demonstrating outside the hospital; realizing his identity has been hopelessly compromised, he commits suicide by giving himself an air embolism. When French learns that the man who met Todd at school was not Todd's grandfather but a war criminal, he confronts Todd, who then blackmails him into silence <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> to accuse him of making inappropriate sexual advances towards him, and to thereby expose him publicly as a homosexual and pederast.|$|E
5000|$|The second [...] "Monmari" [...] {{variation}} {{involved the}} players being <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> other cast members, {{on all fours}} and wearing an outfit with the rear end exposed. The objective in this version was to name items which fit a specified theme (such as [...] "Name a 'Holiday'") within a time limit—those failing {{to do so would}} have the cast member wearing the rear-less outfit advancing towards them. The game was split into two rounds: in the first round, Matsumoto (<b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> Jimmy Onishi) faced Yamasaki (<b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> producer Suga); while in the second round, the positions were reversed—Onishi (<b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> Matsumoto) versus producer Suga (<b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> Yamasaki). This variation was later revived for the 2011 [...] "Do Not Laugh at the Airport" [...] New Year's Eve special.|$|R
50|$|This rare {{plant is}} <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> {{wildfire}} suppression; {{it would be}} more common if its habitat were allowed its natural fire regime. It is also <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> mining operations.|$|R
40|$|For {{many species}} {{the threats of}} climate change occur {{in a context of}} {{multiple}} existing threats. Given the current focus of global change ecology in identifying and understanding species vulnerable to climate change, we performed a global analysis to characterize the multi-threat context for species <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> climate change. Utilizing 30, 053 species from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, we sought to evaluate if species <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> climate change are more likely <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> a greater number of non-climatic threats than species not <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> climate change. Our results show that species <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> climate change are generally impacted by 21 % more non-climatic threats than species not <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> climate change. Across all species, this pattern is related to IUCN risk status, where endangered species <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> climate change face 33 % more non-climatic threats than endangered species not <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> climate change. With the clear challenges of assessing current and projected impacts of climate change on species and ecosystems, research often requires reductionist approaches that result in downplaying this multi-threat context. This cautionary note bears relevance beyond climate change threatened species as we also found other (but not all) anthropogenic threats are also similarly associated with more threats. Our findings serve as a reminder that ecological research should seriously consider these potential threat interactions, especially for species under elevated conservation concern...|$|R
5|$|Verbal goes on {{to explain}} that, after Fenster had bailed on the group, Kobayashi gave them a {{location}} at which to find their compatriot's dead body. They tried to kill Kobayashi, but he strong-armed them into performing the heist <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> their loved ones. They staked out the ship and killed several Argentinian and Hungarian gangsters, but found no drugs on board. McManus, Hockney and a man locked aboard the ship were killed by an unseen person, who also killed Keaton and set the ship on fire as Verbal looked on.|$|E
5|$|With {{crude oil}} as the country's primary export, Gaddafi sought to improve Libya's oil sector. In October 1969, he proclaimed the current trade terms unfair, benefiting foreign {{corporations}} {{more than the}} Libyan state, and <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> to reduce production, in December Jalloud successfully increased the price of Libyan oil. In 1970, other OPEC states followed suit, leading to a global increase {{in the price of}} crude oil. The RCC followed with the Tripoli Agreement, in which they secured income tax, back-payments and better pricing from the oil corporations; these measures brought Libya an estimated $1 billion in additional revenues in its first year.|$|E
5|$|According to Moyzisch, the German Foreign Office did {{not make}} much use of the documents, because {{officers}} there were divided about their reliability for several reasons. There was {{a steady stream of}} documents, which was highly unusual. Cicero seemed to have used sophisticated photography techniques to create unusually clear images, which raised the question of whether he acted alone. Antipathy between Papen and Ribbentrop added to the ineffective analysis of the intelligence. Aware of the Allied forces attempts to bring Turkey into the war, however, Papen was able to thwart their efforts for a time <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> to destroy İzmir and Istanbul if Turkey declared war against Germany. Being able to postpone Turkey's alliance with the Allied forces and the use of their airfields, Papen told Ribbentrop that the way was now clear to take the Balkans.|$|E

5000|$|Between 1973 and 1989 an {{estimated}} 515 translocations occurred {{per year in}} the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. [...] The majority were conducted in the United States. Birds were the most frequently translocated, followed <b>by</b> <b>threatened</b> and endangered species, then non-game species. Of the 261 translocations in the United States reported wild species were most frequently translocated, and the greatest number occurred in the Southeast.|$|R
50|$|Since this {{habitat is}} {{constantly}} <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> encroaching agriculture, the laurel forest animal or vegetal species have already become rare {{in many of}} its former habitats and are <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> further habitat loss.|$|R
5|$|After the Second Punic War, {{there was}} a great {{increase}} in income inequality. While the middle class was drafted to serve in increasingly long campaigns, their farms and homesteads fell into bankruptcy. And with Rome's great military victories, vast numbers of slaves were imported into Italy. In the middle of the second century BC, the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus led to a breakup of the long-standing norms of the republican constitution. Graccus' legislation effectively established a parallel administration challenging the socio-political power of the old aristocracy and establishing a precedent that the popular assemblies could vote themselves whatever they wanted. His younger brother, Gaius Gracchus, further challenged the Senate's political preeminence, <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> it with new judicial procedures. The Senate's violent reaction against both the Gracchi, which led to their deaths, also served to legitimise the use of violence for political ends.|$|E
5|$|As a {{token of}} respect, {{prosecutor}} Klavier Gavin, Kristoph's brother and Apollo's rival, invites him and Trucy to attend a concert for his band, the Gavinners. During a guest performance by the diva Lamiroir, her manager Romein LeTouse is shot and killed in her dressing room. When Machi Tobaye, Lamiroir's pianist, is accused for the killing, Apollo, through an extensive investigation, discovers that Machi {{and one of the}} Gavinners, Detective Daryan Crescend, conspired to smuggle contraband into the country, and that Letouse, in reality an undercover Interpol agent, was murdered to cover it up. The case nearly falls apart {{due to a lack of}} decisive evidence, but Apollo is able to squeeze a confession out of Daryan <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> to have Machi testify.|$|E
5|$|Becoming irritated {{that no one}} {{joined in}} him in walking out on Gabe, Michael goes outside and pulls the cable connection, causing it to turn off. Hysteria erupts, and Michael becomes {{self-conscious}} over the commotion he has caused. He goes outside to fix the cable. There he is discovered by Erin, who throughout the evening {{has been trying to}} encourage Michael to bond with Gabe. Michael, still indignant over the idea that his office views Gabe as his boss, is initially irritated by her efforts, but eventually realizes that Erin views him as a father figure. He jokes around and tells her to go to her room, leading to a bonding moment between the two. As he leaves the party, Michael brings Gabe into the joke <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> to kill him if he breaks Erin's heart.|$|E
