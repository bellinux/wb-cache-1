5|$|After {{his return}} in August 1299, Lamberton was Guardian of Scotland and Nicholas became his close associate. Nicholas can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> have benefited as a result. He became Chancellor of Scotland by 30 January 1301. Balmyle's pension for being Chancellor {{was to be}} paid by Arbroath Abbey, for which the abbey later fell into arrears.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though it}} was {{subordinate}} to Vale Royal Abbey, the church at Llanbadarn Fawr remained important in its own right. The building was actually substantially extended in 1475, {{with the construction of}} a large new sanctuary. There was also a Rood screen and loft, with a carved image of Christ crucified, with the figures of Mary and St John either side, though this is now gone, although the steps to the loft may still <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> {{the north side of the}} chancel.|$|E

5000|$|Avi {{attempts}} to get Jake {{to understand the nature}} of the ego. He tells Jake [...] "the greatest con that ego ever pulled was making you believe that he is you." [...] This <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the 'ultimate con', in that no-one wants to sever their connection with their ego, because they refuse to challenge their own lifelong investment in it. In the end, Jake also steps off the proverbial chess board by making a conscious effort to reverse everything his ego tells him <b>to</b> do. This <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the truest and most fundamental application of the Formula. The characters of Jake, Zach, Avi and Sorter (Mark Strong) <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> ultimately reject the ego's 'rules'. The character of Dorothy Macha <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> succumb to them.|$|R
5|$|Grissom {{is often}} {{regarded}} as well-educated, but unusual in his approach toward {{his work and}} social life. In the series, some of his comments and actions can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> dumbfound his co-workers and superiors. His relationship with his subordinates in the office is portrayed as being a father figure to the team, but very professional in his work.|$|E

Its low, hipped roof and overhanging eaves are reminiscent of Wright's Prairie Houses. This early work also demonstrates his interest in Czech Cubism {{and the work of}} Auguste Perret.|$|E

5|$|The {{cell nucleus}} {{contains}} {{the majority of}} the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> form the well-defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. A small fraction of the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria.|$|E

In terms of recovering a sense of agency (in a conflict characterised by protestations of powerlessness by political and military authorities alike), the desire to do (and <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> do) something was expressed and assuaged by transporting and incorporating some of the need and distress into the UK where it could be tended to and made better.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, {{millions}} of returning soldiers were still {{not entitled to}} vote. This posed another dilemma for politicians since they could <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> be withholding the vote from the very men who had just fought to preserve the British democratic political system. The Representation of the People Act 1918 attempted to solve the problem, enfranchising all adult males {{as long as they}} were over 21 years old and were resident householders. It also gave the vote to women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications. The enfranchisement of this latter group was accepted as recognition of the contribution made by women defence workers, though the actual feelings of members of parliament (MPs) at the time is questioned. In the same year the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 allowed women over 21 to stand as MPs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} range, {{parts of the}} medieval {{buildings}} survive and are incorporated into staircase ten — the straight, steep flight of stairs and timber framed partitions date from a mid-15th century rebuilding of St Mary Hall. The former Chapel, Hall and Buttery of St Mary Hall, built in 1640, form part of the Junior Library and Junior Common Room. Viewed from the third quad, the Chapel, with its Gothic windows, can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> have been built neatly {{on top of the}} Hall, a unique example in Oxford of such a plan.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{discussion}} in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called analytic philosophy (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy). Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of continental philosophy. In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, {{in relation to the}} philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label (phenomenology, existentialism, etc.) can globally <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to {{the discussion}} of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of thought and perceptual experience in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.|$|E

Seven hundred and forty kilograms (1630lb) of essential weight was thus lost {{in the first few}} minutes. Before it was well clear of the launch site, the Eagle had turned from a supposedly steerable craft into an ordinary hydrogen balloon with a few ropes hanging from it, {{at the mercy of the}} wind; its crew had no means to direct it to any particular goal and had too little ballast for stability. Lightened, the balloon rose to 700meters (2300ft), an unimagined height, where the lower air pressure made the hydrogen escape all the faster through the eight million little holes.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Marathon was a {{watershed}} in the Greco-Persian wars, showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten; the eventual Greek triumph in these wars can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> begin at Marathon. The battle also showed the Greeks {{that they were}} able to win battles without the Spartans, as they had heavily relied on Sparta previously. This win was largely due to the Athenians, and Marathon raised Greek esteem of them. Since the following two hundred years saw the rise of the Classical Greek civilization, which has been enduringly influential in western society, the Battle of Marathon is often seen as a pivotal moment in Mediterranean and European history.|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance in Scotland was a cultural, {{intellectual}} and artistic movement in Scotland, {{from the late}} fifteenth century {{to the beginning of}} the seventeenth century. It is associated with the pan-European Renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in Italy in the late fourteenth century and reaching northern Europe as a Northern Renaissance in the fifteenth century. It involved an attempt to revive the principles of the classical era, including humanism, a spirit of scholarly enquiry, scepticism, and concepts of balance and proportion. Since the twentieth century the uniqueness and unity of the Renaissance has been challenged by historians, but significant changes in Scotland can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> have taken place in education, intellectual life, literature, art, architecture, music and politics.|$|E
