On 16 October 2009 Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in a first instance verdict, found Milorad Trbić directly responsible for the crimes he committed as part of a joint criminal enterprise to destroy all the Bosniaks brought into his area of responsibility during the period following the fall of Srebrenica. The Court sentenced Trbić for his participation in the crimes to thirty years imprisonment.|$|E

5000|$|The Commission {{concluded}} that the Government of the Sudan has not pursued a policy of genocide. Arguably, two elements of genocide might be deduced from the gross {{violations of human rights}} perpetrated by Government forces and the militias under their control. These two elements are, first, the actus reus consisting of killing, or causing serious <b>bodily</b> <b>or</b> <b>mental</b> <b>harm,</b> or deliberately inflicting conditions of life likely to bring about physical destruction; and, second, {{on the basis of a}} subjective standard, the existence of a protected group being targeted by the authors of criminal conduct. However, the crucial element of genocidal intent appears to be missing, at least as far as the central Government authorities are concerned. Generally speaking the policy of attacking, killing and forcibly displacing members of some tribes does not evince a specific intent to annihilate, in whole or in part, a group distinguished on racial, ethnic, national or religious grounds. Rather, it would seem that those who planned and organized attacks on villages pursued the intent to drive the victims from their homes, primarily for purposes of counter-insurgency warfare.|$|E

40|$|The December 1999 {{judgment}} of the ICTY in the Jelisic case is the first ruling on the merits from that court dealing with an indictment for genocide. The Trial Chamber concluded that the Prosecutor had failed to prove that genocide was committed and that consequently the accused could not be convicted as an accomplice to the crime. It went on to examine whether {{despite the absence of}} genocide on any widespread or systematic basis it was still possible for an individual, driven by genocidal intent, to commit one of the underlying crimes such as killing or causing serious <b>bodily</b> <b>or</b> <b>mental</b> <b>harm.</b> The Trial Chamber considered this a plausible hypothesis but ruled that this did not correspond to the facts of the case. Since the Jelisic ruling, the Preparatory Commission of the International Criminal Court has attempted to eliminate the lone génocidaire scenario in the Elements of Crimes. While the law remains unsettled, awaiting clarification from the Appeals Chamber, a wise prosecutorial policy would be to reserve international genocide prosecutions for serious cases involving organized and widespread crimes. Exaggerated attention to individual and isolated cases is a questionable use of valuable resources and risks diluting some of the terrible stigma now attached to the “crime of crimes. ...|$|E
40|$|The study {{analyzes}} how rape can constitute genocide. The starting {{premise is}} that rape has effects and it is through these effects that they can contribute to genocide. The effects of rape are analyzed {{in light of the}} provisions listed in Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide to see whether the effects of rape actually meet the criteria for genocide. The effects are divided into physical and psychological effects on the individual and societal level. A feminist viewpoint is used to highlight concepts such as gender, identity, and ethnicity that are essential in understanding genocide and genocidal rape but that are also ignored by traditional IR theories. According to a feminist view, rape is viewed not as a violation of the victim"s honor but as a violent assault of sexual nature that can cause serious bodily and mental harm to the victim and also have serious societal effects. Genocide functions as a context for genocidal rape, not as a theoretical framework in the traditional sense. Rape was found to fall most clearly under provision (b) (causing serious <b>bodily</b> <b>or</b> <b>mental</b> <b>harm)</b> of Article 2 of the Convention, but rape can also fulfil the criteria for provision (a) (killing members of the group) through the death of the victim as a result of rape, provision (c) (deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part) when rape results in serious physical (including reproductive) harm, provision (d) (imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group) through death and physical and/or psychological harm to the victim, and through the societal response to the rapes that can include the ostracizing and abandonment of the victim, and provision (e) (forcibly transferring children of the group to another group) if women are forced to marry into, and ultimately bear children of, different ethnic groups, or through forced impregnation and forced maternity. Genocidal rape needs to be analyzed in its situational context in order to deduce special intent, or dolus specialis, for the rapes. An analysis of the cultural context of genocidal rape is necessary to understand the societal response. Rape that occurs in a genocidal context without special intent does not constitute genocide.
