40|$|The <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark</b> (Somniosus microcephalus) is {{the largest}} predatory fish in Arctic waters. Knowledge of the {{fundamental}} biology and ecological role of the <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark</b> is limited, and the sensory biology of the <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark</b> has been poorly studied. Given the potential relevant contribution of chemoreception to the sensory capability of the <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark</b> to forage and navigate in low-light environments, we examined {{the architecture of the}} peripheral olfactory organ (the olfactory rosette) through morphological, histological and immunohistochemical assays. We found that each olfactory rosette consists of a small number of lamellae (22) associated with a relatively high surface area of the olfactory epithelium. The general organization of the epithelium is similar to that described for other elasmobranchs. However, details that have emerged concerning the cell type composition (absence of crypt neurons, presence of unusually large cells along the olfactory fiber bundles) deserve further investigation. Overall, the structure of the olfactory rosette suggests a well-developed olfactory capability for the <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark</b> coherent with a bentho-pelagic lifestyle...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark</b> Somniosus microcephalus (Bloch and Schneider, 1801) is {{the largest}} predatory fish in Arctic waters. The {{socio-economic}} significance of <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark</b> is demonstrated by {{its impact on the}} fishing cultures in Greenland, Scandinavia and Iceland for centuries. The fundamental biology and ecological role of <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark,</b> on the other hand, is virtually unknown. Although knowledge of its life history is limited, increasing evidence indicates that the <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark</b> may undertake long-distance migrations and perform vertical movements from the surface to the deep sea. It is an omnivorous species feeding on carrion and a wide variety of pelagic and bottom-dwelling organisms ranging from invertebrates to mammals, and including active species such as fishes and seals. Accordingly, <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark</b> should be recognized as a top predator, with a strong potential to influence the trophic dynamics of the Arctic marine ecosystem. The sensory biology of <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark</b> is scarcely studied, and considering the importance of olfaction in chemoreception, feeding and other behavioral traits, we examined the architecture of the peripheral olfactory organ where olfactory cues are received from the environment – the olfactory rosette. The structural organization of the olfactory rosette, in terms of histological features of the sensory epithelium, number of primary lamellae and total sensory surface area, provides a first proxy of the olfactory capability of <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark.</b> Based on own results and published studies, the overall morphology of the olfactory rosette is viewed in context of the functional and trophic ecology among other elasmobranch species...|$|R

40|$|The remote sub-Arctic/Arctic {{environment}} has due to human activities become a sink for organohalogen contaminants (OHCs). These OHC include traditional contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), DDTs and technical mixtures of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), all {{included in the}} Stockholm Convention list of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Other OHCs, currently under evaluation to be included among the POPs i. e. short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) are also found in these environments {{as well as a}} whole range of other OHCs. The main objective of this thesis is to increase the knowledge about the presence of OHCs in a high trophic Arctic <b>shark</b> species, the <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark</b> (Somniosus microcephalus). The <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark</b> is an opportunistic feeder, occasionally feeding {{at the top of the}} Arctic marine food chain. Furthermore may this species have a life span in excess of 100 years and is probably among the oldest of any fish species. These traits make the shark prone to accumulate elevated concentrations of OHCs. This has shown to be true for the <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> studied and most of the targeted OHCs were determined in the species. The highest concentrations were observed for the DDTs, ranging up to 26 μg/g fat. Other OHCs reported that are of special interest are SCCPs and brominated flame retardants used as replacement products to PBDEs; pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB) and 1, 2 -bis(2, 4, 6 -tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE). Also a range of OHCs whose origin is assumed to be natural, were shown to be present in <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks.</b> This thesis is stressing the fact that even though the use of certain OHCs has been banned for decades they are still present at high concentrations in the deep waters of the Arctic. Therefore it is of major importance to continue to monitor the fate of traditional and emerging OHCs in the environment, and for this purpose the <b>Greenland</b> <b>shark</b> is an excellent species.

40|$|Abstract Life-stage-based {{management}} of marine fishes requires information on juvenile habitat preferences to ensure sustainable population demographics. This is espe-cially {{important in the}} Arctic region given very {{little is known about}} the life histories of many native species, yet exploitation by developing commercial and artisanal fisher-ies is increasing as the ice extent decreases. Through scien-tific surveys and bycatch data from gillnet fisheries, we document captures of rarely reported juvenile <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> (Somniosus microcephalus; B 200 cm total length [TL]) during the ice-free period in the Canadian Arctic. A total of 22 juvenile animals (42 % of total catch; n = 54), including the smallest reliably measured individual of 117 cm TL, were caught on scientific longlines and bottom trawls in Scott Inlet and Sam Ford Trough over three con-secutive years. Molecular genetic nuclear markers confirmed species identity for 44 of these sharks sampled; however, two sharks including a juvenile of 150 cm TL were identified as carrying a Pacific sleeper shark (Somniosus pacificus) mito-chondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) haplotype. This represents the first record of a Pacific sleeper shark genetic signature in <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> in Eastern Arctic waters. Juvenile sharks caught as bycatch in gillnet fisheries were only observed offshore in Baffin Bay surrounding a fishery closure area, while larger subadult and mature <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> ([200 cm TL) were caught in all fishing locations, including areas where juveniles were observed. The repeatable occur-rence of juvenile <b>Greenland</b> <b>sharks</b> in a fjord and their pre-sence at two offshore sites indicates that these smaller animals either reside in nurseries or have defined home ranges in both coastal and offshore regions or undertake large-scale inshore– offshore movements...|$|R
