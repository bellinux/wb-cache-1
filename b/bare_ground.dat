5|$|The {{dominant}} {{vegetation cover}} of coastal sage scrub typically goes through approximately 25-year cycles, with its peak biodiversity reached in roughly 10 {{years after the}} beginning of a new 25-year period. Such periods are typically separated by wildfires, which clear away dead or dying vegetation and leave <b>bare</b> <b>ground</b> for new growth. The canyon is one of the last remaining sanctuaries for many plants native to Southern California. Approximately one hundred species of plants, most native to California, are found in Laurel and Willow Canyons alone. These include monkey flower, goldenrod, and sagebrush.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} typically seeks invertebrate food on tree trunks, starting {{near the}} tree base and {{working its way}} up using its stiff tail feathers for support. Unlike a nuthatch, it does not come down trees head first, but flies {{to the base of}} another nearby tree. It uses its long thin bill to extract insects and spiders from crevices in the bark. Although normally found on trees, it will occasionally hunt prey items on walls, <b>bare</b> <b>ground,</b> or amongst fallen pine needles, and may add some conifer seeds to its diet in the colder months.|$|E

50|$|Unlike its African counterpart, the Indian {{pangolin}} {{does not}} climb trees, {{but it does}} value the presence of trees, herbs, and shrubs in its habitat because {{it is easier to}} dig burrows around them. Features that promote an abundance of ants and termites (grasses, <b>bare</b> <b>grounds,</b> bases of trees, shrubs, roots, leaf litter, fallen logs and elephant feces) are often present in pangolin habitats.|$|R
5|$|The {{black vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and feeds on carrion, {{but will also}} eat eggs or kill newborn animals. In areas populated by humans, it also feeds at garbage dumps. It finds its meals either by using its keen eyesight or by following other (New World) vultures, which possess {{a keen sense of}} smell. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It lays its eggs in caves or hollow trees or on the <b>bare</b> <b>ground,</b> and generally raises two chicks each year, which it feeds by regurgitation. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. This vulture also appeared in Mayan codices.|$|E
5|$|The {{seasonal}} polyphenism in {{willow grouse}} differs between Scottish and Scandinavian populations. In Scotland, grouse have two plumages (breeding and non-breeding), while in Scandinavia {{there is a}} third plumage, a white winter morph. The genetic basis for this is not in the melanin pigment system, and is probably due to regulatory changes. The behaviour of moulting females in springtime depends on their plumage state: they tend to sit on snow while they are mainly white, but choose the border between <b>bare</b> <b>ground</b> and snow when they have more dark feathers. They seem to be choosing the best compromise between camouflage and food quality.|$|E
5|$|Control of the plant, when desired, is best managed via {{mechanical}} means, such as hand pulling and hoeing, preferably {{followed by}} sowing of native plants. Animals rarely graze {{it because of}} its irritating hairs, and liquid herbicides require surfactants to be effective, as the hair causes water to roll off the plant, much like the lotus effect. Burning is ineffective, as it only creates new bare areas for seedlings to occupy. G. tetrum and Cucullia verbasci usually have little effect on V.thapsus populations as a whole. Goats and chickens have also been proposed to control mullein. Effective (when used with a surfactant) contact herbicides include glyphosate, triclopyr and sulfurometuron-methyl. Ground herbicides, like tebuthiuron, are also effective, but recreate <b>bare</b> <b>ground</b> and require repeated application to prevent regrowth.|$|E

40|$|Around the Agatsuma sulfur mine in Gunma Prefecture, {{degraded}} landscapes {{caused by}} smoke damages {{have been formed}}. Landform, soils and vegetation and the vegetation changing processes are surveyed and analyzed. Degraded plant communities of Sasa and Carextypes are distributed in moderately damaged area, and patches of eroded <b>bare</b> <b>grounds</b> have been formed in heavily damaged area. Degradation and restoration processes of degraded landscapes {{are similar to those}} of volcanic desert landscapes around the crater of Mt. KusatsuSirane, but distribution patterns of degraded lands are quite different. The result of analysis suggests that landscape conservation treatments based on ecological evaluation are needed to minimize the appearance of man-induced land and vegetation degradation...|$|R
5|$|Disturbance is {{important}} in the creation of biodiverse habitats. In the absence of disturbance, a climax vegetation cover develops that prevents the establishment of other species. Wildflower meadows are sometimes created by conservationists but most of the flowering plants used are either annuals or biennials and disappear after a few years in the absence of patches of <b>bare</b> <b>ground</b> on which their seedlings can grow. Lightning strikes and toppled trees in tropical forests allow species richness to be maintained as pioneering species move in to fill the gaps created. Similarly coastal habitats can become dominated by kelp until the seabed is disturbed by a storm and the algae swept away, or shifting sediment exposes new areas for colonisation. Another cause of disturbance is when an area may be overwhelmed by an invasive introduced species which is not kept under control by natural enemies in its new habitat.|$|E
5|$|The brolga breeds {{throughout}} its range in Australia and New Guinea. The {{start of the}} breeding season is largely determined by rainfall rather than the time of year; thus the season is February to May after the rainy season in the monsoonal areas, and September to December in southern Australia. The flocks split up and pairs establish nesting territories in wetlands. In food-rich habitats, nests can be quite close together, and are often found {{in the same area}} as those of the sarus crane. The nest, which is built by both sexes, is a raised mound of sticks, uprooted grass, and other plant material sited on a small island in shallow water, or occasionally floating. If no grasses are available, mud or roots unearthed from marsh beds are employed. Sometimes the birds make hardly any nest, take over a disused swan nest, or simply lay on <b>bare</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
5|$|The male {{selects a}} territory, which he defends against conspecifics, and re-establishes a pair bond with his mate or attracts a new female if necessary. Courtship {{involves}} ritualised flight and ground displays, {{and the male}} often presents a fish to his partner. Most species {{have little or no}} nest, laying the eggs onto <b>bare</b> <b>ground,</b> but Trudeau's tern, Forster's tern and the marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats. Black and lesser noddies build nests of twigs, feathers and excreta on tree branches, and brown, blue, and grey noddies make rough platforms of grass and seaweed on cliff ledges, in cavities or on other rocky surfaces. The Inca tern nests in crevices, caves and disused burrows, such as that of a Humboldt penguin. The white tern is unique in that it lays its single egg on a bare tree branch.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examined}} the coping strategies {{adopted by the}} rural population in Yobe State of Nigeria to desertification. Data on methods used to cope with desertification were collected from eighteen development areas of the study area, as well as government agencies. The main objective was to examine how the process of desertification has forced the local population to use various coping strategies. Structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Data analysis employed the use of air photographs of the development areas obtained from the North East Arid Zone Development Programme (NEAZDP) for the 1990 s and 2000 s. These aerial photographs were used to validate the presence of sand dune accumulation, <b>bare</b> <b>grounds,</b> depletion of water bodies and vegetation cover. These results were validated at the Regional Centre for Remote Sensing in Jos. The study finings show that the expanding desert is a severe environmental problem. Environmental changes have been significant particularly in reduction of water body, depletion of vegetation cover, shifting sand dunes, increasing <b>bare</b> <b>grounds</b> and loss of biodiversity. A combination of coping strategies such as use of trees as wind breaks, woven stick construction around houses, agro-forestry practices and fadama farming {{have been used by}} the local population. The paper suggests the need for massive tree plantings in the study area and Nigeria in general. The Federal and State Departments of Forestry need to be empowered with adequate revenue for massive reforestation programme. Regulation to discourage dependence on wood for local energy should be put in place, while other sources of energy such as kerosene should be adequately provided...|$|R
50|$|In type NM cable, {{conductor}} insulation is color-coded for identification, typically one black, one white, and a <b>bare</b> <b>grounding</b> conductor. The National Electrical Code (NEC) specifies {{that the black}} conductor represent the hot conductor, with significant voltage to earth ground; the white conductor represent the identified or neutral conductor, near ground potential; and the bare/green conductor, the safety grounding conductor not normally used to carry circuit current. Wires may be re-colored, so these rules are commonly excepted. In 240-volt applications not requiring a neutral conductor, the white wire {{may be used as}} the second hot conductor, but must be recolored with tape or by some other method. Four-wire flexible equipment connection cords have red as the fourth color; unlike older European practices, color-coding in flexible cords is the same as for fixed wiring.|$|R
5|$|The seeds {{maintain}} their germinative powers for decades, up {{to a hundred}} years, according to some studies. Because of this, and because the plant is an extremely prolific seed bearer (each plant produces hundreds of capsules, each containing up to 700+ seeds, with a total up to 180,000 or 240,000 seeds), it remains in the soil seed bank for extended periods of time, and can sprout from apparently <b>bare</b> <b>ground,</b> or shortly after forest fires long after previous plants have died. Its population pattern typically consists of an ephemeral adult population followed by {{a long period of}} dormancy as seeds. Great mullein rarely establishes on new grounds without human intervention because its seeds do not disperse very far. Seed dispersion requires the stem to be moved by wind or animal movement; 75% of the seeds fall within 1 m of the parent plant, and 93% fall within 5 m.|$|E
5|$|The terns are {{birds of}} open {{habitats}} that typically breed in noisy colonies and {{lay their eggs}} on <b>bare</b> <b>ground</b> {{with little or no}} nest material. Marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats, and a few species build simple nests in trees, on cliffs or in crevices. The white tern, uniquely, lays its single egg on a bare tree branch. Depending on the species, one to three eggs make up the clutch. Most species feed on fish caught by diving from flight, but the marsh terns are insect-eaters, and some large terns will supplement their diet with small land vertebrates. Many terns are long-distance migrants, and the Arctic tern may see more daylight in a year than any other animal.|$|E

50|$|Many of {{the species}} are adapted to forest fires, holding their seeds {{for many years in}} closed cones until the parent trees are killed by a fire; the seeds are then {{released}} to colonise the <b>bare,</b> burnt <b>ground.</b> In other species, the cones open at maturity to release the seeds.|$|R

30|$|The high soil {{compaction}} around the piospheres resulted in high soil bulk density and reduced soil porosity. Consequently, soil hydraulic conductivity was hampered, reducing soil moisture content. <b>Bare</b> <b>grounds</b> near the piospheres further exposed {{the soil to}} impact of raindrops, decreasing soil aggregate stability and making the soils vulnerable to erosion. This {{could have been the}} reason sand content was higher near the piospheres, because the fine clay and silt particles had been carried off by either water or wind. It is recommended that that grazing animals be placed under strict monitoring {{to reduce the amount of}} time spent around the piospheres and minimize {{soil compaction}}. Alternatively, the number of piospheres can be increased to reduce the number of animals drinking from each. Range reseeding should also be done to rehabilitate the areas that are already degraded.|$|R

50|$|A {{mountain}} plover nest has a survival rate {{that ranges from}} 26 to 65%. This wide range {{may be due to}} the impact that varying climate has on nest survival. A nest made in a colder climate with less precipitation has a better chance of survival. These conditions are preferred because of the climate's effect on the eggs directly, changes in predatory behavior, or changes in vegetation that can affect the mortality rates of parents. Higher heat may expose eggs to heat stress;also, a wetter climate may factor in to predators having a more sensitive sense of smell, aiding the discovery of nests. Nest predators are the biggest cause of nest destruction. Because of this, it is a primary driving force of survival rate. Increase in soil moisture may the environment of <b>bare</b> <b>grounds</b> and short grass that prairie birds thrive in.|$|R

50|$|Shields {{on power}} cables may be {{connected}} to earth ground at each shield end and at splices for redundancy to prevent shock even though induced current will flow in the shield. This current will produce losses and heating and will reduce the maximum current rating of the circuit. Tests show that having a <b>bare</b> <b>grounding</b> conductor adjacent to the insulated wires will conduct the fault current to earth more quickly. On high-current circuits the shields might be connected only at one end. On very long high-voltage circuits, the shield may be broken into several sections since a long shield run may rise to dangerous voltages during a circuit fault. There is a risk of shock hazard from having only {{one end of the}} shield grounded. The maximum recommended shield potential rise is 25 volts. IEEE 422 and 525 lists the cable lengths that would limit shield potential to 25 volts for a single point ground application.|$|R
