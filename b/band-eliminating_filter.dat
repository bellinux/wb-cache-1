Since there are no international standards {{for this type of}} filter, each electrocardiograph system has its own manufacturer-specific filter. Our studies indicate that the time-varying electro-potential distributions are altered by filtering. Electrocardiograph signals are in a frequency range on the order of 0.05 to 100 Â Hz and filtering in that range distorts waveforms and prevents accurate signal capture. Accordingly, the system does not include a <b>band-eliminating</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E
