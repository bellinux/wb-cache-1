5|$|In November 2009 Cameron {{and others}} {{distributed}} free copies of an altered version of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species {{on college campuses}} in the United States. The book consisted of Darwin's text with chapters of the book removed, and with an added introduction by Ray Comfort reiterating common creationist assertions about Darwin and evolution. The book was criticized by scientists and Darwin biographers who criticized the omission of key chapters of the book, and who stated that its introduction contains misinformation about Darwin, and long-refuted creationist arguments about the science of evolution, such as the linking of Nazi racial theories to Darwinist ideas. Comfort later said that the four chapters were chosen at random to be omitted {{in order to make}} the book small enough to be affordable as a giveaway, with the absent chapters available for download, but that the missing chapters were included in the second edition, which had a smaller text size that made printing the entire book as a giveaway affordable. The second edition still lacks Darwin's preface and glossary of terms. The National Center for Science Education arranged a campaign to distribute an analysis of the Comfort introduction and a banana <b>bookmark</b> at colleges across the U.S., a reference to Comfort's presentation of the banana as an argument for the existence of God.|$|E

Bookmarks are normally accessed through a menu in the user's web browser, and folders are commonly used for organization. In addition to bookmarking methods within most browsers, many external applications offer <b>bookmark</b> management.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to characterise and on basic level analyse current social <b>bookmarking</b> tools. The first chapter offers a {{definition}} of social <b>bookmarking</b> which is represented by three axes: URL, user, tags. URL has a key role. A subcategory called social news exists, in its case time in which a resource represented by the URL is shared makes an important factor. Social <b>bookmarking</b> is introduced as a helpful tool for a user's work. It has two aspects: effective organisation of user <b>bookmarks</b> and social environment which allows for discovery of useful resources. The second chapter focuses on history of <b>bookmarks,</b> history of social <b>bookmarking</b> and describes options for connection of social <b>bookmarking</b> tools to related tools.

These centrally stored collections of Internet resources can be accessed by other users to find useful resources.

40|$|Abstract:- Social <b>bookmarking</b> via {{a web-based}} system enables {{students}} {{to manage their}} <b>bookmarks,</b> share their <b>bookmarks</b> with other students on the Internet (inside and outside classroom). This study discussed the feasibility of the integration of learning theories and social <b>bookmarking</b> service through some cases. The possible aims of social <b>bookmarking</b> service emphasize the use of web 2. 0 technology in learning; the collection, and sharing of information; discussions with peers; and construction of learning communities. In this study, we have illustrated the social <b>bookmarking</b> service and the possible learning opportunities successfully. Further study should examine the effectiveness of social <b>bookmarking</b> service in different fields, forms of learning (e. g., alone or group), tasks (e. g., structured or ill-structured), forms of evaluation (e. g., summative or formative), and forms of community (e. g., community of practice or community of knowledge creation) ...|$|R
25|$|Live {{bookmarks}} are internet bookmarks, {{particularly in}} Mozilla Firefox that are powered by RSS. It allow users to dynamically monitor changes to their favorite news sources. Instead of treating RSS-feeds as HTML pages like most news aggregators do, {{they are treated}} as bookmarks that are updated in real-time with {{a link to the}} appropriate source. Live bookmarks are updated automatically; however no browser option exists to prevent or control the automatic Live <b>Bookmark</b> updates.|$|E
25|$|When calculating PageRank, {{pages with}} no {{outbound}} links {{are assumed to}} link out to all other pages in the collection. Their PageRank scores are therefore divided evenly among all other pages. In other words, to be fair with pages that are not sinks, these random transitions are added to all nodes in the Web, with a residual probability usually set to d = 0.85, estimated from the frequency that an average surfer uses his or her browser's <b>bookmark</b> feature.|$|E

On the shield is a saltire which is an “X” shaped object. On the saltire sits a gilt edged book the cover of which is red (gules.) On {{the cover of the}} book is a star (mullet) of six points. Mullets normally only have five points. At the foot of the book is a <b>bookmark</b> also in red being the third colour mentioned. The saltire and the book are surrounded by four other stars each also of six points which are placed in the spaces formed by the saltire. The five stars and the saltire are all coloured gold (or) which was the second colour mentioned. An Escrol is the scroll under the shield containing the motto.|$|E

A special category includes bookmarks {{that have not}} yet been categorized. Another innovative concept supported by Web (though originally from Galeon) is [...] "smart bookmarks".

40|$|Social <b>bookmarking</b> {{services}} have recently {{made it possible}} for us to register and share our own <b>bookmarks</b> on the web and are attracting attention. The services let us get structured data: (URL, Username, Timestamp, Tag Set). And these data represent user interest in web pages. The number of <b>bookmarks</b> is a barometer of web page value. Some web pages have many <b>bookmarks,</b> but most of those <b>bookmarks</b> may have been posted far in the past. Therefore, even if a web page has many <b>bookmarks,</b> their value is not guaranteed. If most of the <b>bookmarks</b> are very old, the page may be obsolete. In this paper, by focusing on the timestamp sequence of social bookmarkings on web pages, we model their activation levels representing current values. Further, we improve our previously proposed ranking method for web search by introducing the activation level concept. Finally, through experiments, we show effectiveness of the proposed ranking method...|$|R
