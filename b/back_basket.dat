5000|$|The Seri {{people in}} Sonora {{have one of}} the best-known basketry traditions, with the most {{important}} items being a kind of basket called the corita. Until the popularity of ironwood carvings, baskets were the main notable craft of the Seri. Coritas are mad with the branches of a brush or bush called torote (jatropha cuneatas), which grows in the desert. [...] Except for shoulder yokes used to carry bundles on the <b>back,</b> <b>baskets</b> were used to transport everything except liquids by the Seri. Shallow baskets were carried on the head by Seri women, balanced by the use of a head ring and carried everything from wood, harvests, meat and clothes. Baskets were used for winnowing and storage. The served as suitcases, buckets and refuse containers.|$|R

50|$|The second robbery {{required}} {{much more}} organisation {{to clear the}} descending corridor - a tunnel was dug in the top-left-hand corner of the tunnel, and the outer door was penetrated by a large hole in the blocking. Carter estimated {{that it would have}} taken a team of men around eight hours to excavate the tunnel by passing <b>back</b> <b>baskets</b> of rubble. The second robbery penetrated the entire tomb, and Carter estimated that around 60% of the jewelry in the Treasury had been looted, along with precious metals. At some point, a knotted scarf containing a number of looted rings was dropped back into a box in the Antechamber, which led Carter {{to the conclusion that the}} robbery had perhaps been discovered whilst it was in progress, or that the thieves had been pursued and caught.|$|R

[...] "I should say that a plan of this sort could only be {{successful}} after those who attempted it had made themselves masters of all particulars of the place and its ways. Everything would depend upon all going smoothly and without hitches of any kind. If you really think of undertaking such an adventure, Captain Heraugiere, I should be very glad to act under you if Sir Francis Vere will give me leave to do so; but I {{would suggest that the}} first step should be for us to go into Breda in disguise. We might take in a wagon load of grain for sale, or merely carry on our <b>backs</b> <b>baskets</b> with country produce, or we could row up in a boat with fish." ...|$|R

Whatever you may choose to do, do not say in after days that I urged you to the deed." ...|$|R
60|$|Rollo's {{attention}} was immediately {{attracted to the}} form of the basket which Ninette wore and to {{the manner in which it}} was fastened to her <b>back.</b> The <b>basket</b> was comparatively small at the bottom, being about as wide as the waist of the girl; but it grew larger towards the top, where it opened as wide as the girl's shoulders--being shaped in this respect in conformity with the shape of the back on which it was to be borne.|$|R
60|$|He {{staggered}} <b>back</b> {{with the}} <b>basket,</b> painfully conscious {{all the while}} that it was creasing his waistcoat, and dumped {{it down on the}} study floor. Mr. Downing stooped eagerly over it. Psmith leaned against the wall, and straightened out the damaged garment.|$|R
25|$|The body or {{basket of}} the chariot rested {{directly}} on the axle (called beam) connecting the two wheels. There was no suspension, making this an uncomfortable form of transport. At the front and sides of the basket was a semicircular guard about 3ft (1 m) high, to give some protection from enemy attack. At the <b>back</b> the <b>basket</b> was open, {{making it easy to}} mount and dismount. There was no seat, and generally only enough room for the driver and one passenger.|$|R

60|$|He was {{round as}} an apple, {{with a fresh}} rosy face, {{laughing}} eyes, and a bushy beard as white as snow. A red cloak trimmed with beautiful ermine hung from his shoulders and upon his <b>back</b> was a <b>basket</b> filled with pretty presents for the Princess Ozma.|$|R
60|$|The Emperor {{was as much}} amused as a {{child with}} a new toy. He formed little groups of the figures upon the table, so that he might have an idea of how the dignitaries would look when they chatted together. Then he threw them all <b>back</b> into the <b>basket.</b>|$|R
50|$|The next morning, {{he returns}} to the castle and the old woman appears with a basket full of seeds. She {{scatters}} them all over the grass and tells Henry that as his first task he has one hour to pick all the seeds up and place them <b>back</b> in the <b>basket.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was told}} to see that her maid took the unfortunate animal to a {{veterinary}} surgeon. Judkins was frankly mutinous, the hotel porters were busy with some baggage, {{and there was not}} a cab on the rank. I told her to put the basket down while she looked for a hack near the station; and then crossed the street as I saw one coming. When I got <b>back</b> the <b>basket</b> had gone, but a boy gave me a note on a scrap of torn paper. It said, 'Don't worry; the beast is in safe hands. You'll get it back to-night.'" ...|$|R

50|$|Named after Jack Sikma, {{the post}} player {{receives}} {{the ball with}} their <b>back</b> to the <b>basket</b> and keeps the ball at forehead level. The post then pivots to face the basket while bringing the ball overhead (almost behind the head) to shoot a jump shot. The ball is released high over the head {{making it difficult for}} the defense to block.|$|R
60|$|This was uttered {{in a way}} {{to induce}} the major to throw all the {{articles}} <b>back</b> into the <b>basket,</b> as if he wished {{to get rid of the}} subject, without further comment. Owing to this precipitation, the scarf was not seen. Fortunately for Maud, who was ready to burst into tears, the service of the tea prevented any farther allusion to the matter.|$|R

5000|$|Other {{tales of}} this type vary on the exact offense that the {{grandson}} declares he will commit and the son thereafter refrains from: making his father sleep under half a blanket in the stables, bringing back the carrier so he can carry his father to abandon him, or commit murder. [...] In medieval Europe, the son was commonly sent for a blanket {{and came back with}} half, justifying it by saying the other half is saved for his father. In an Asian version, the father weaves a basket to throw his aged father into the river. A son says to bring <b>back</b> the <b>basket</b> {{so that it can be}} used for the father one day.|$|R
50|$|A mayor {{negative}} is his lanky frame, it {{can see him}} struggle defending against inside {{players or}} muscular guards, in offense it also limits his post move when he's <b>back</b> to the <b>basket,</b> making him an imperfect fit for the 4 position.For the 3 position, he lacks safe ball-handling on the dribble and needs to develop his shooting options {{to be a better}} fit and develop from his Tweener status.|$|R
