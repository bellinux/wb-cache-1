However, there are no large prospective studies documenting the prevalence, duration, and timing of such problems in breast-feeding women, particularly those who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Methods. Women enrolled prenatally underwent a breast-feeding counseling intervention until 6 months after delivery. Breast health problems were documented per breast for 180 days after delivery, with 14 -day recall histories. Results. Breast health problems were rare, {{and there were no}} significant differences between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women for any of the following conditions: engorgement, 39 HIV-infected women (3. 5 %) versus 33 HIV-uninfected women (2. 7 %; P=. 30); breast thrush, 17 (1. 5 %) versus 12 (1. 0 %; P=. 25); <b>bleeding</b> <b>nipple,</b> 6 (0. 5 %) versus 4 (0. 3 %; P=. 45); and mastitis/abscess, 11 (1. 0 %) versus 6 (0. 5 %; P=. 17). Most problems occurred during the first month after birth, with few additional mothers experiencing problems after this point: at 1 and 6 months, 13 % and 17 % of all mothers, respectively, had experienced a minor or major breast health problem, including sore nipples. Women who had not exclusively breast-fed their infants were more likely to experience any of the breast health problems than were women who had exclusively breast-fed their infants (time-dependent variable; adjusted odds ratio, 1. 46; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 13 - 1. 87; P=. 003). HIV-infected women who experienced any serious breast health problem (i. e., <b>bleeding</b> <b>nipple,</b> pus oozing from a nipple or breast, or mastitis/abscess) were 3. 55 times (95 % confidence interval, 0. 86 - 14. 78 times; P=. 08) more likely to transmit HIV postnatally to their infant. Conclusions. With encouragement to exclusively breast-feed, women experienced few breast health problems. When those problems did occur, HIV-infected women with <b>bleeding</b> <b>nipple,</b> pus oozing from a nipple or breast, or mastitis/abscess were more likely to transmit HIV to their infants...|$|R
50|$|Bacteria {{can enter}} the breast through cracked nipples. This can result in an {{infection}} of the breast - mastitis. Breastmilk has antibacterial action and can protect the baby from infections. The antibacterial properties of milk help to protect the infant. A breast feeding mother can become infected by a Candida infection (thrush) infection in the infant and develop deep-pink, cracked, and sore nipples. It has been found safe for breastfeeding mothers with hepatitis B and cracked nipples to breastfeed. In the event that a nursing woman experiences cracked and <b>bleeding</b> <b>nipples</b> or breast inflammation within one to two weeks immediately following an acute Toxoplasmosis infection (when the organism is still circulating in her bloodstream), it is theoretically possible that she could transmit Toxoplasma gondii to the infant through her breast milk. Immune suppressed women could have circulating Toxoplasma for even longer periods of time. However, the likelihood of human milk transmission is very small. Transmission risk of HIV increases if the mother has cracked and <b>bleeding</b> <b>nipples</b> An uncommon infection in the mother, Chagas disease, can be transmitted to the nursing infant via cracked nipples. Women with hepatitis C are advised to abstain from breastfeeding if their nipples are cracked or bleeding.|$|R
40|$|The author {{emphasizes}} the importance of the congenital transmission of Chagas' disease and discusses the possible risk factors for transmission such as age, origin, obstetrical history and maternal form of disease. Exacerbation of infection during pregnancy is also considered as a possible risk factor for transmission. Besides, a relationship between the frequency of transmission and gestational age is presented. Concerning breast-feeding, the risk of transmission {{is directly related to the}} acute phase of maternal disease and <b>bleeding</b> <b>nipples.</b> The deleterious effects of chagasic infection on the fetus and newborn are also considered...|$|R
50|$|On a {{hydraulic}} vehicle braking systems, the bleed screws (sometimes known as <b>bleed</b> <b>nipples</b> or bleeder valves) are {{located at the}} top of each brake caliper to allow bleeding of the braking system. Whenever service work has been performed on the braking system which might have introduced air into the system (i.e. the hydraulic system has been opened), the air must be bled out. This is necessary for correct operation of the system, because air compresses (as opposed to brake fluid which is not compressible). Air in the system reduces the maximum pressure applied to the brake pistons and can lead to loss of braking ability.|$|R
40|$|Chagas disease (infection by the {{protozoan}} Trypanosoma cruzi) {{is a major}} {{parasitic disease}} of the Americas {{and one of the}} main neglected tropical diseases. Although various routes of transmission sre recognized, the risk for transmission of the infection through breast-feeding has not clearly been established. We reviewed the literature on transmission of T. cruzi through breast-feeding to provide breast-feeding mothers with Chagas disease with medical guidance. Although data from animal studies and human studies are scarce, we do not recommend that mothers with Chagas disease discontinue breast-feeding, unless they are experiencing the acute phase of the disease, reactivated disease resulting from immunosuppression, or <b>bleeding</b> <b>nipples.</b> In these cases, thermal treatment of milk before feeding the infant may be considered...|$|R
40|$|Tooth {{eruption}} normally {{starts from}} 6 months of age. Teeth that appear at birth are called natal teeth, whereas, teeth that erupt {{during the first}} month of life are called neonatal teeth. Both are uncommon, with the ratio of natal to neonatal is 3 : 1. Presence of neonatal teeth may lead to complication in mother like painful bitten or <b>bleeding</b> <b>nipples</b> or it may cause complications in babies like difficulty in feeding, pain/distress due to erupting tooth, swallowing of the tooth, repeated trauma to the tip or undersurface of the tongue resulting in Riga-Fede ulceration and rarely aspiration. We are presenting a 15 -day-old male baby who admitted in our hospital primarily with excessive crying and poor feeding and on a thorough physical examination revealed an erupting neonatal tooth. Other causes of excessive crying have been excluded...|$|R

30|$|Despite these tensions, it {{was rare}} for women we interviewed to {{directly}} challenge {{the value of}} breastfeeding. This may in part be an effect of the interview encounter itself (Pugh 2013), in which women are likely to present themselves as good mothers who uphold widely held standards. A rare exception was Zheng Ting (interviewee 11 a), who explained that she never really wanted to breastfeed at all, and only began doing so because her milk came in. She suggested that her milk was “not too good” and caused her baby to suffer from peeling skin and diarrhea, a diagnosis made by the elders (laoren) in her family because her diet contained too many things that nursing women should traditionally avoid (such as spicy foods and too much “oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar”). And yet, this woman used a breast pump for 4  months, despite damaged, <b>bleeding</b> <b>nipples,</b> and her aversion to nursing. Her interview is filled with contradictions like these: She insisted {{that she did not}} want to breastfeed and she was not pressured to nurse, and yet, her family was united against her in support of breastfeeding. She explained that she preferred infant formula from the start because “we cannot possibly be like rural people, nursing the child all along, we have to go to work,” but in the next breath, she described herself as “rather lazy,” not eating as healthily as rural people, and even suggested the urban people’s breast milk could have “poison” (du) in it because of their polluted environment. Even with all these contradictions, this woman did not reject the idea that mothers had enormous responsibility for their child’s well-being, and she described the enormous efforts she made to purchase safe, foreign infant formula for her baby. Her case illustrates the powerful ways in which a particularly intensive ideological construction of motherhood has wed with class position and the specific practice of breastfeeding to shape the infant-feeding practices of even strongly resistant middle-class mothers.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Intraductal {{papilloma}} of {{the breast}} {{is characterized by a}} proliferation of epithelial and myoepithelial cells overlying fibrovascular stalks creating an arborescent structure within the lumen of duct. Case report We present a 36 years female patient with history of <b>bleeding</b> from the <b>nipple</b> of right breast since last 3 months. Examination of right <b>nipple</b> revealed <b>bleeding</b> and mammography show a right ductal papilloma. We performed microdochectomy of the involved duct with excision of ductal papilloma of the right breast. Histopathology of the excised specimen revealed ductal papillomawith adenosis and ductal hyperplasia. Conclusion If papilloma is located to a single duct,microdochectomy gives satisfactory results in younger patients with a minimal interference withthe breast...|$|R
40|$|On hundred milk or {{colostrum}} {{samples from}} 78 mothers with chronic Chagas' disease were parasitologically studied for Trypanosoma cruzi infection {{by means of}} direct examination and inoculation of mice. The mice were submitted to direct bllod examination three times a week. At the end of 45 days, xenodiagnosis and indirect immunofluorescent test (IFAT) for T. cruzi antibodies were {{carried out in the}} animals. No parasitized sample was observed even though five mothers had parasitemia at milk collection. In addition, 97 breast-fed children of chronic chagasic mothers, born free of infection, were tested for IgG antibodies to T. cruzi using IFAT. No case of T. cruzi infection was detected. The authors conclude that breast-feeding should not be avoided for children for chronic chagasic women. However, as these mothers had intermittent parasitemia, they should avoid nursing when there is <b>nipple</b> <b>bleeding...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Factor V {{deficiency}} {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} coagulation disorder. Awareness of presenting features and management is important to avoid bleeding complications associated with mortality and neurodisability. Case presentation A 6 -day-old Pakistani boy was admitted with bleeding from the left nipple. His parents were first cousins. A coagulation screen showed a prothrombin time of 41 s (control 14 s), a partial thromboplastin time of 132 s (control 33 s) and a normal thrombin time of 15 s (control 14 s). Factor V activity was Conclusion This case illustrates that in an unusually bleeding newborn of consanguineous parents rare severe homozygous bleeding disorders need to be considered. <b>Nipple</b> <b>bleeding</b> {{may be the first}} presentation of a congenital bleeding disorder. In cases of factor V deficiency where factor concentrates are not available long term use of fresh frozen plasma can prevent potentially life threatening bleeding. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Diffuse hepatic metastases with hepatic {{failure as}} a {{presentation}} of a T 2 breast cancer is rare. This is also remarkable seeing our case had been on fertility treatments before presentation. There are no documented reports of breast cancer patient on fertility treatment presenting with diffuse hepatic metastases and liver failure. Case summary: A 41 year old Para 1 Nigerian woman being managed for secondary infertility with an extended use of clomiphene presented with a 3 months history of a left breast lump, <b>nipple</b> <b>bleeding</b> and later, yellowness of eyes, right hypochondrial pain malaise and drowsiness. Abdominal USS showed an enlarged liver with diffuse metastatic nodules. Liver function tests showed persistently elevating liver enzymes and serum bilirubin. Serology showed Hepatitis B negative. She {{was diagnosed with a}} T 2 left invasive ductal carcinoma, Er−, Pr+ Her 2 + with deteriorating liver function from diffuse hepatic metastases She had chemotherapy but succumbed barely a week of presentation. Conclusion: Breast cancer screening for patients before fertility treatments and continual surveillance while on such treatment is highly recommended...|$|R
