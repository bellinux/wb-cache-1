25|$|The {{presence}} of heavy metals in the clinker arises {{both from the}} natural raw materials and {{from the use of}} recycled by-products or alternative fuels. The high pH prevailing in the cement porewater (12.5 < pH < 13.5) limits the mobility of many heavy metals by decreasing their solubility and increasing their sorption onto the cement mineral phases. Nickel, zinc and lead are commonly found in cement in non-negligible concentrations. Chromium may also directly arise as natural impurity from the raw materials or as secondary contamination from the abrasion of hard chromium steel alloys used in the <b>ball</b> <b>mills</b> when the clinker is ground. As chromate (CrO42−) is toxic and may cause severe skin allergies at trace concentration, it is sometimes reduced into trivalent Cr(III) by addition of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4).|$|E

2500|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that the huge supply of agricultural cellulose, the lignocellulosic material {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "Nature's polymer", would be an ideal source of material for biofuels and many other products. Composed of lignin and monomer sugars such as glucose, fructose, arabinose, galactose, and xylose, these constituents are very valuable in their own right.

50|$|A typical type of fine grinder is {{the ball}} mill. A {{slightly}} inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls, usually stone or metal, which grind {{material to the}} necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls. <b>Ball</b> <b>mills</b> normally operate with an approximate ball charge of 30%. <b>Ball</b> <b>mills</b> are characterized by their smaller (comparatively) diameter and longer length, and often have a length 1.5 to 2.5 times the diameter.

40|$|<b>Ball</b> <b>milling</b> is an {{energy-intensive}} {{unit operation}} and usually consumes a major {{proportion of the}} power drawn by a typical mineral processing plant. Hence, substantial economic benefits {{can be achieved by}} optimal design and by operating <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> circuits under optimum process conditions. This requires an accurate <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> modelling technique. In the multi-segment <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> model, the size-dependent material transport within the mill varies systematically with the amount of coarse particles present in each segment. The ore-specific breakage distribution function can be determined from single particle breakage tests conducted using a computer-monitored twin pendulum apparatus. When the ore-specific breakage distribution function is used in the multi-segment, a constant relationship between the breakage rate parameters and mill diameter is observed. Thus, the performance of an industrial <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> can be adequately described using the ore-specific breakage distribution function together with the systematic variation of the material transport and the breakage rate functions with process conditions and mill diameter, respectively.

50|$|Aside from common <b>ball</b> <b>mills</b> {{there is}} a second type of ball mill called a {{planetary}} ball mill. Planetary <b>ball</b> <b>mills</b> are smaller than common <b>ball</b> <b>mills</b> and mainly used in laboratories for grinding sample material down to very small sizes. A planetary ball mill consists of at least one grinding jar which is arranged eccentrically on a so-called sun wheel. The direction of movement of the sun wheel is opposite to that of the grinding jars (ratio: 1:-2 or 1:-1 or else).The grinding balls in the grinding jars are subjected to superimposed rotational movements, the so-called Coriolis forces. The difference in speeds between the balls and grinding jars produces an interaction between frictional and impact forces, which releases high dynamic energies. The interplay between these forces produces the high and very effective degree of size reduction of the planetary ball mill.|$|E
