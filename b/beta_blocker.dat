For this the change in the acoustic startle reflex of rats with alarm pheromone-induced anxiety (i.e. reduction of defensiveness) has been measured.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{quantify}} the potential harm of <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> {{in patients with}} peripheral arterial disease. Materials and methodsAll randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> with placebo for the outcomes of claudication and maximal walking distance and time, calf blood flow, vascular resistance and skin temperature were searched using the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, PubMed and CINAHL. Trials comparing different types of <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> were excluded. ResultsSix RCTs fulfilling the above criteria, {{with a total of}} 119 patients, were included. The <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> studied were atenolol, propranolol, pindolol and metoprolol. None of the trials showed a statistically significant worsening effect of <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> on the outcomes measured. There were no reports of any adverse events with the <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> studied. ConclusionsCurrently, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> adversely affect walking distance in people with intermittent claudication. <b>Beta</b> <b>blockers</b> should be used with caution if clinically indicated, especially in patients with critical ischaemia where acute lowering of blood pressure is contraindicated...|$|R

25|$|Some alleles {{that vary}} in {{frequency}} between specific populations {{have been shown}} to be associated with differential responses to specific drugs. The <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> atenolol is an anti-hypertensive medication that is shown to more significantly lower the blood pressure of Caucasian patients than African American patients in the United States. This observation suggests that Caucasian and African American populations have different alleles governing oleic acid biochemistry, which react differentially with atenolol. Similarly, hypersensitivity to the antiretroviral drug abacavir is strongly associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism that varies in frequency between populations.|$|E
25|$|Propranolol is {{classified}} as a non-cardioselective sympatholytic <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> that crosses the blood–brain barrier. It is lipid soluble and also has sodium channel blocking effects. Propranolol is a non-selective beta blocker; that is, it blocks the action of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) at both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. It has little intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, but has strong membrane stabilizing activity (only at high blood concentrations, e.g. overdose). Propranolol is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and exert effects in {{the central nervous system}} in addition to its peripheral activity.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, {{abdominal}} pain, and constipation. It {{should not be}} used in those with an already slow heart rate and most of those with heart failure. Quickly stopping the medication in those with coronary artery disease may worsen symptoms. It may worsen the symptoms of asthma. Greater care is recommended in those with liver or kidney problems. Propranolol may cause harmful effects in the baby if taken during pregnancy. Its use during breastfeeding is probably safe, but the baby should be monitored for side effects. It is a non-selective <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> which works by blocking β-adrenergic receptors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Beta</b> <b>blockers</b> {{should not}} be used as a {{first-line}} treatment in the acute setting for cocaine-induced acute coronary syndrome (CIACS). No recent studies have been identified that show the benefit of <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> in reducing coronary vasospasm, or coronary vascular resistance, in patients with CIACS. In the multiple case studies identified, the use of <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> in CIACS resulted in detrimental outcomes, and the discontinuation of <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> used in the acute setting led to improvement in clinical course. The guidelines by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association also support this idea, and recommend against the use of <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> in cocaine-induced ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) because of the risk of coronary vasospasm. Though, in general, <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> improve mortality in patients who have suffered MI, it is unclear whether patients with CIACS will benefit from this mortality reduction because no studies assess the use of <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> in the long term, and because cocaine users may be prone to continue to abuse the substance, thus complicating the effect of drug therapy.Contrast media are not contraindicated in patients receiving <b>beta</b> <b>blockers.</b>|$|R

25|$|Propranolol, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Inderal among others, is a {{medication}} of the <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> type. It is used to treat high blood pressure, a number of types of irregular heart rate, thyrotoxicosis, capillary hemangiomas, performance anxiety, and essential tremors. It is used to prevent migraine headaches, and to prevent further heart problems in those with angina or previous heart attacks. It can be taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. The formulation that is taken by mouth comes in short acting and long acting versions. Propranolol appears in the blood after 30 minutes and has a maximum effect between 60 and 90 minutes when taken by mouth.|$|E

50|$|<b>Beta</b> <b>blockers</b> help {{patients}} with cardiovascular disease by blocking β receptors, {{while many of}} the side-effects of these medications are caused by their blockade of β2 receptors. For this reason, <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> that selectively block β1 adrenergic receptors (termed cardioselective or β1-selective <b>beta</b> <b>blockers)</b> produce fewer adverse effects (for instance, bronchoconstriction) than those drugs that non-selectively block both β1 and β2 receptors.|$|R

2500|$|... β-blockers' {{binding site}} to the {{receptor}} {{is the same}} as for endogenous catecholamines, such as noradrenaline and adrenaline. This binding is based on hydrogen bonds between the β-blocker and the receptor, and therefore not based on covalent bonds, which results in the reversibility of the binding. A significant step in the development of β adrenergic antagonists was the discovery that an oxymethylene bridge (—OCH2—, figure 7) could be inserted into the arylethanolamine structure of pronethalol to produce propranolol. Propranolol is an aryloxypropanolamine, which are more potent β-blockers than arylethanolamines. Today, most of the β-blockers used clinically are aryloxypropanolamines. The length of the side chain is increased when an oxymethylene bridge is introduced. It has been shown that the side chains of aryloxypropanolamine can adopt a conformation that puts the hydroxyl and amine groups in {{more or less the same}} position as with <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> that do not have this group as a part of the side chain.|$|E
2500|$|Two of {{the most}} {{valuable}} drug treatments for essential tremor are propranolol, a <b>beta</b> <b>blocker,</b> and primidone, an anticonvulsant. [...] Propranolol is much more effective for hand tremor than head and voice tremor. [...] Some beta-adrenergic blockers (beta blockers) are not lipid-soluble and therefore cannot cross the blood–brain barrier (propranolol being an exception), but can still act against tremors; this indicates that this drug’s mechanism of therapy may be influenced by peripheral beta-adrenergic receptors. [...] Primidone’s mechanism of tremor prevention has been shown significantly in controlled clinical studies. [...] The benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and barbiturates have been shown to reduce presentation of several types of tremor, including the essential variety. [...] Controlled clinical trials of gabapentin yielded mixed results in efficacy against essential tremor [...] while topiramate was shown to be effective in a larger double-blind controlled study, resulting in both lower Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor scale ratings and better function and disability as compared to placebo.|$|E
