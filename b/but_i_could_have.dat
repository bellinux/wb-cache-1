500|$|Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal criticized most of {{the musical}} {{performances}} in the episode, calling [...] "Run Joey Run" [...] the highlight of an otherwise [...] "slow, forced show". Flandez opined of [...] "Ice Ice Baby": [...] "Will, kicking it old school, doesn't cut it with his '80s-flashback moves because a.) he takes himself too seriously and b.) he looks like he's in a J.Crew mag, not part of 2 Live Crew." [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times wrote that he hated the episode, similarly calling [...] "Run Joey Run" [...] his favorite song, but noting that that was [...] "not hard considering the songbook that was offered". Kennedy deemed the [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] performance his least favourite moment of the entire series thus far. He concluded: [...] "Each of the musical numbers felt about two minutes longer than they should have been. I love Newton-John’s walk-on cameo, but I don’t want them {{to fall into the}} habit of re-creating music videos frame by frame: It was cute - once. It sounds harsh, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> completely done without the episode. It was almost as if they needed filler just to showcase the [...] "Physical" [...] video." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide named their rendition one of Glee worst performances.|$|E
2500|$|In February, Dibaba {{hoped to}} break the indoor 2 mile world record at the New Balance Indoor Grand Prix in Boston. Her pacer, however, quit at the 1 {{kilometre}} mark, and she finished in 9:13.17, seven seconds off the record. Dibaba said after the race, [...] "With this first race , I am happy. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> run faster with better pacing--9:03 or 9:04. I {{would have liked to}} have broken the meet record.... Running alone is a bit tough. When I broke the world record at 5000 meters, I had good pacemakers." ...|$|E
2500|$|On video are the Covent Garden {{production}} of Salome (1992) in Peter Hall's production, The Cunning Little Vixen (1992), and La traviata (1995). She also {{appears in a}} wide range of specialist recordings for the Reader's Digest, notably the Timeless Favourites series of 3-CD sets produced by Jay Productions between 1995 and 2000. [...] In a 2004 interview, Knight said, [...] "I don't think I've ever been satisfied with a recording. [...] I haven't played all my recordings. [...] Some of them I haven't heard. [...] I haven't seen... the video that I did of Salome from Covent Garden.... erhaps when I'm not singing any more, I'll dig it out and watch it.... I listen and I'll think, 'Yes, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done this or that'".|$|E

2500|$|Trey Spruance joined former Mr. Bungle bandmate Mike Patton and {{the band}} Faith No More onstage {{for the first time}} to perform the King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime album in its {{entirety}} in Santiago in November 2011. Mike Patton recently sung on the Secret Chiefs 3 song [...] "La Chanson de Jacky" [...] in 2012 giving further speculation by fans on the chance of a reunion. Despite this, Trevor Dunn stated in a February 2013 interview with SF Weekly that there will be no Mr. Bungle reunion, saying, [...] "I've heard the faintest murmurings about it, but honestly I don't think anyone is interested. It's nothing personal, either. We all feel like that band said what it needed to say. It would feel weird and awkward to play that music again. It would take a pant-load of money to make it happen, and honestly, I don't want to do it for that reason. I would prefer to let go of it, respectfully." [...] When asked about Mr. Bungle reuniting in an interview published in February 2014, Patton responded by saying, [...] "Who knows? It certainly doesn't seem like it's on the tip of anyone's lips, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> said the same thing - and in fact, I did say the same thing - about Faith No More, and that happened. And I think it happened for the better." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Hello, chatterbox," [...] {{retorted}} Redhead with {{a twinkle}} in his eyes. [...] "I didn't know you were talking about my family, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> guessed that you were talking about some one's family. Does your tongue ever stop, Jenny?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> n't <b>have</b> {{dreamt of}} smoking in your presence. And {{we take the}} liberty to dream very strange things." ...|$|R
60|$|I walked on, alert, {{trying to}} take in everything, {{wondering}} if I would meet Steele, wondering how I would know him if we did meet. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> believed <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> picked that Ranger out of a thousand strangers, though I had never seen him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hilda, how wonderfully quick {{you are at}} {{reading these}} things! I see you are right; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>have</b> guessed so much myself from such small premises." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} the goody-goody one close to, so I can't say," [...] Drummond answered. [...] "Certainly I was a little way off at the café, {{and she had a}} hat and veil on, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> sworn that it was 'Alcide.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|IF I {{could have}} put you in my heart, If <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> wrapped you in myself, How glad I should have been! And now the chart Of memory unrolls again to me The course of our journey here, before we had to [...] part.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot explain it, sir, further, {{than that}} the Lady Mansel sent me here, {{in spite of}} my earnest prayers, tears, and entreaties. I was not afraid of any thing, for I knew I should be protected. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> died then--could die now--for very shame and confusion!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been a fool," [...] {{said the}} skipper. [...] "I've been a fool. I've made myself a laughing-stock all round, <b>but</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{it all over}} again I would." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> got up the rope, Holland, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> gone up straight, as you did, without {{stopping}} {{for a bit}} to take breath. You don't look so very strong, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I came in my car. You will perhaps {{say that}} it was not wise, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> stood the subway. My nerves are all rotten." [...] Jocelyn Thew's tone and gesture were {{smoothly}} disdainful.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This {{is great}} news indeed, Mr Wegg. There's no denying it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> wished you had told it me {{before you got}} your fright to-night, and I could have wished you had ever asked me as your partner what we were to do, before {{you thought you were}} {{dividing}} a responsibility.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Ashley: [...] "The {{time has}} seemed long, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> waited all day. I couldn't have gone without seeing you, and telling you--" [...] He pauses, as if bewildered at the {{spectacle}} of Miss Ramsey's resolute practice with the cigarette, which she now takes from her lips and waves before her face with innocent recklessness.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{then the}} beans were spilled [...] . by accident. Come {{a letter from}} Wisconsin. My Aunt Eliza 'd died and up and left me her big farm. I let out a whoop when I read it; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> canned my joy, for I was jobbed out of it by the courts and lawyers afterward--not a cent to me, and I'm still paying 'm in instalments.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Yes, I {{should have}} spoken; I should have put {{everything}} before you; I came intending to do it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> <b>have</b> spoken {{to you as}} you have spoken to me, Rosa.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> been so {{effective}} in taking care that some measure be proposed worthy of support as I may possibly be now. I thought {{a good deal}} about it, and I believe that my decision was right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, the {{way down}} ain't far from the other one. I will show it you, one of these days. I went down there, once, to get a hawk I had taken from the nest, and tamed. I went down, first, with a rope tied round me; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> found <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done it without that--but I didn't tell any of the others, as I {{wanted to keep the}} place to myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said he, {{speaking}} more quietly, [...] "not {{just like}} that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{done it all}} had it pleased me, {{and it was this}} sense of power that made my heart beat so proudly. I took no life, Kate, if it could be helped, and when I had stripped a ship of her goods, I put her people upon shore before I burned her." ...|$|E
6000|$|The old {{man looked}} at him with a curious little smile. [...] "The doctor Bob brought off didn't quite seem to know, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> told him. Guess I'm done, boy. It's quite likely I'll crawl out on deck for a little while, but how's that going to count? Nobody's going to have any more use for your father, Jimmy, and when the month is up Merril will take the {{schooner}} from him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How I {{should like}} to have been with you," [...] she said, when he finished. [...] "At least, I think I should have liked it. I should have been dreadfully in the way, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{sat down in the}} hut and loaded the guns, while you were both fighting. You could have shown me how to do it. How brave of you both to have fought fifty or sixty men!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had nothing}} to say. At least I had nothing {{in my mind that}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> an {{undefined}} impression that it might have been better if we had had some other inmate, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>have</b> explained why even to myself. Or, if to myself, certainly not to anybody else.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{the little}} {{creature}} was lying by her, {{and she put}} her hand on it, and gave one of those smiles that are so terribly like his; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> spoken about it for the world. Such fools we be!' concluded Charles, with an attempt at a smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{feeling on}} the subject was so strong that, as you may remember, I {{declined}} to act as your secretary. I am perhaps over-sensitive, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> written your book as you would have dictated it to me, and as you did indeed dictate it to your various secretaries." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{stood over}} against her {{and gazed at}} her, and she smiled at me--a [...] strange, wicked smile, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> laid my soul at her feet. She [...] never spoke or moved, and neither did I feel the need of spoken words, [...] for I {{understood}} the meaning of those upon the Mount when they said, [...] 'Let us make here tabernacles: {{it is good for}} us to be here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't wonder {{a bit at}} her {{accepting}} a fellow like that. I hated him the first moment I saw him; but that's no reason she should hate him. He had that sort of manner, you know. He was a swell, and girls like that kind of thing. I never felt angry with her, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> eaten him." [...] As he spoke he {{looked as though he}} would have made some such attempt had Crosbie been present.|$|E
6000|$|The King, thus hard pressed, {{had little}} to say against a custom so engrafted upon {{the laws of the}} realm and the usages of chivalry as the trial by combat; and he only replied: [...] "God knows, I have never granted such license as you urge me with unless with the {{greatest}} repugnance; and that I never saw men have strife together to the effusion of blood, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> wished to appease it with the shedding of my own." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{too large}} a {{contract}} for the Stubenmadchen's vocabulary; she couldn't call the hand.

6000|$|... "All {{this to me}} is very astonishing!

6000|$|... "I thank you," [...] she said. [...] "I am much honoured, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>have</b> married {{you because}} I do not love you. You must {{understand}} me very little {{if you think}} that I should be the more ready to do so on account of the danger in which I stand," [...] and she ceased.|$|R
