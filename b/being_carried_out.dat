5|$|Bainbridge {{was elected}} a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1937. His {{interest}} in mass spectroscopy led naturally to {{an interest in}} the relative abundance of isotopes. The discovery of nuclear fission in uranium-235 led to an interest in separating this isotope. He proposed using a Holweck pump to produce the vacuum necessary for this work, and enlisted George B. Kistiakowsky and E. Bright Wilson to help. There was little interest in their work because research was <b>being</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> elsewhere. In 1943, their cyclotron was requisitioned by Edwin McMillan for use by the U. S. Army. It was packed up and carted off to Los Alamos, New Mexico.|$|E
