25|$|A <b>bionic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> is {{a digital}} contact lens worn {{directly}} on the human eye which in the future, scientists believe could one day serve as a useful virtual platform for activities such as surfing the World Wide Web, superimposing images on real-world objects, playing video games for entertainment, and for monitoring patients' medical conditions. The <b>bionic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> {{is a form of}} nanotechnology and microfabrication constructed of light emitting diodes, an antenna, and electronic circuit wiring. The <b>bionic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> is the 2008 creation of Iranian-American Babak Parviz, an electrical engineer at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle.|$|E
40|$|The sci-fi of {{yesterday}} may soon become {{the reality of}} today. Currently, the University of Washington’s (UW) finest engineers are developing <b>bionic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lenses.</b> The lenses are not intended to correct impaired vision, but rather to display virtual images on miniature personal screens. This new nanotechnology {{has the potential to}} change society in significant ways, but the form of that change, and whether the overall effect on quality of life will be positive or negative, can still be determined by how we choose to design and use these <b>lenses.</b> <b>Bionic</b> <b>Contact</b> Lenses Similar to other new technologies, nanotechnology will change society in many ways. What makes nanotechnology unique is that development takes place at a sub-microscopic level. <b>Bionic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> fall into the category of nanotechnology since the manufacturing processes for the circuits require manipulation at the sub-microscopic level. Current breakthroughs involve those manufacturing processes. To develop the <b>bionic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> engineers will first create a display with a few pixels. Afterwards, modification and improvements will be made on the lenses for people to access websites, display images or information, or even have the game industry create a version of the <b>bionic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> use for gaming purposes. There are number of potential medical purposes for the lenses as well. Since the human eyes provide information about the medical status of the body and the lenses are in direct contact with the eyes, the lenses could be used to monitor minute changes in the body. For instance, diabetics could use the bionic lenses to monitor their blood sugar levels...|$|R

This includes work on: brain-computer interfaces, muscle-computer interfaces, tongue-computer interfaces, bio-acoustic sensing (e.g. in the Skinput project), using the body as an antenna (e.g. in the Humantenna project), as well as work on <b>bionic</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: (1) To {{quantify}} {{the effect of}} <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear on straylight in rigid and soft <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers and (2) to relate findings to morphological changes and subjective complaints. Methods: Straylight was measured using the Oculus C-Quant during <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear and after <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> removal in 30 rigid <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers and 30 soft <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers. Semi-quantitative (0 - 4) slit-lamp grading of anterior segment changes using Efron grading scales and <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> characteristics were performed. Subjects answered a straylight questionnaire. Results: Soft <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers had a mean straylight of logarithmic value of the straylight parameter [log(s) ] = 0. 934 during <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear and after <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> removal [comparable to log(s) = 0. 938 of age-matched normal eyes]. Rigid <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers had a mean straylight during <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear of log(s) = 1. 167. After <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> removal, log(s) significantly decreased to 0. 997 (P < 0. 01). Straylight values with rigid <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> were strongly increased (P < 0. 001) compared with age-matched normal eyes; after <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> removal, these values decreased but remained elevated. Straylight in rigid <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers correlated {{with the amount of}} deposits on the <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> (P < 0. 01) but not with other variables of the <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> score. The questionnaire showed more straylight complaints in rigid <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers than in soft <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: Rigid <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear leads to increased straylight during <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear and after <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> removal. This may be because of subclinical effects of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear on the cornea and is not seen in soft <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearer...|$|R
40|$|Practitioners rarely {{embark on}} <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> fitting with the {{expectation}} that their patients will abandon <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> but the sad fact is that many do.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Microbial corneal {{infection}} {{is the most}} serious complication of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear. <b>Contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases are a recognised potential source of pathogens associated with corneal ulcers. METHODS [...] This survey established the incidence of protozoal, bacterial, and fungal <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case contamination in 101 asymptomatic daily wear cosmetic <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers from a domiciliary <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> practice. RESULTS [...] Eighty two (81 %) <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases were found to be contaminated, with 19 (19 %) sterile. Of all <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases, 78 (77 %) grew bacteria, 24 (24 %) fungi, and 20 (20 %) protozoa. Acanthamoeba spp were isolated from eight (8 %) <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases. Fifty six (55 %) <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases yielded mixed bacterial contamination. This is the first <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case survey in which hydrogen peroxide disinfection was the major method of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> disinfection (75 % of subjects) and no home made saline was used. All the contaminating organisms were shown to possess the enzyme catalase that breaks down hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water. The polymicrobial nature of the biofilms found in many <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases is illustrated electron micrographically. CONCLUSION [...] Based on data from this and previous studies, the authors conclude with recommendations for <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers: (1) regular scrubbing of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case interior to disrupt biofilms; (2) exposure of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case to very hot water (> or = 70 degrees C) will kill Acanthamoeba contaminants; (3) allow <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case to air dry between uses; (4) if hydrogen peroxide dis{{infection is}} preferred, use a two step system; (5) replace <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> case regularly...|$|R
50|$|In addition, <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers are {{typically}} advised to discontinue <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear and replace contaminated <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> and <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> cases. (Contaminated lenses and cases {{should not be}} discarded as cultures from these {{can be used to}} identify the pathogen).|$|R
40|$|Keratoconus is {{the most}} common corneal distrophy. It’s a noninflammatory {{progressive}} thinning process that leads to conical ectasia of the cornea, causing high myopia and astigmatism. Many treatment choices include spectacle correction and <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear, collagen cross linking, intracorneal ring segments implantation and finally keratoplasty. <b>Contact</b> <b>lenses</b> are commonly used to reduce astigmatism and increase vision. There are various types of lenses are available. We reviewed soft <b>contact</b> <b>lenses,</b> rigid gas permeable <b>contact</b> <b>lenses,</b> piggyback <b>contact</b> <b>lenses,</b> hybrid <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> and scleral-semiscleral <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> in keratoconus management. The surgical option is keratoplasty, but even after sutur removal, high astigmatism may stil exists. Therefore, <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> is an adequate treatment option to correct astigmatism after keratoplasty...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To {{describe}} the past 20 years’ correction modalities for keratoconus and their visual outcomes and possible complications. Methods. A {{review of the}} published literature related to the visual outcomes and possible complications {{in the context of}} keratoconus management using nonsurgical procedures for the last 20 years (glasses and <b>contact</b> <b>lenses)</b> was performed. Original articles that reported the outcome of any correction modalities of keratoconus management were reviewed. Results. The most nonsurgical procedure used on keratoconus management is the <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> fitting. Soft <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> and soft toric <b>contact</b> <b>lenses,</b> rigid gas-permeable <b>contact</b> <b>lenses,</b> piggyback <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> system, hybrid <b>contact</b> <b>lenses,</b> and scleral and corneoscleral <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> form the contemporary range of available lens types for keratoconus management with <b>contact</b> <b>lenses.</b> All of them try to restore the vision, improve the quality of life, and delay surgical procedures in patients with this disease. Complications are derived from the intolerance of using <b>contact</b> <b>lens,</b> and the use of each depends on keratoconus severity. Conclusions. In the context of nonsurgical procedures, the use of <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> for the management of keratoconic patients represents a good alternative to restore vision and improve the quality of live in this population...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this survey}} was to {{evaluate}} the use of <b>contact</b> <b>lenses,</b> current prescribing habits of practitioners and the development of the <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> market in Hong Kong. Methods: Questionnaires were sent to all registered <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> practitioners in Hong Kong. This questionnaire sought information about their choices on prescribing <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> and lens care products and their opinions on continuing education and future trends of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> development. Results: A total of 286 responses (22 per cent) were returned. On average, the respondents reported that 36 per cent of their patients were <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers and most were myopes. The ratio of new fittings to refittings was 1 : 3. Of the <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers, 66 per cent were fitted with planned replacement lenses, mostly daily disposable lenses. Multipurpose solution was the most popular lens care regimen prescribed. Only 48 per cent of astigmatic patients were fitted with toric lenses and the use of overnight orthokeratology and silicone hydrogel lenses was limited. Single vision <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> with over-spectacles and monovision <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> were the most popular management for presbyopes. Dryness was the major problem reported by <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers. Practitioners look forward to further development of custom-made toric, multifocal and silicone hydrogel lenses. The major source of new <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> information was communication with <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> suppliers. Conclusion: Compared to previous reports, there was no significant change in the prescribing habits of practitioners. The major complaint of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers is still ocular dryness. The <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> market is driven by younger <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers, and planned replacement soft <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> together with multipurpose solutions dominate. The use of bifocal/multifocal lenses remained low and practitioners want low cost bifocal/multifocal <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> with better visual performance and toric lenses with a wider range in parameters. The use of overnight wear lenses such as silicone hydrogel and ortho-k lenses is limited and 30 days continuous wear silicone hydrogel lenses are prescribed mainly for daily wear.

40|$|Purpose: Discontinuation from <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear {{has been}} {{identified}} as a contributing factor in the lack of growth of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> use in Europe. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the proportion of lapsed <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wearers that can be refitted successfully with <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> and to evaluate the reasons for discontinuation from <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear.

40|$|Abstract only We {{measured}} {{contrast sensitivity}} at three distances (330 mm, 660 mm and 4 m) with six <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> and two multifocal spectacle corrections for presbyopia. The two spectacle corrections were D-segment bifocals and trifocals and the <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> corrections were distance <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> with lookover spectacles, soft progressive bifocals, soft concentric bifocals, monovision, modified monovision, and hard crescent segment bifocals. The spectacle corrections in general gave better {{results for the}} contrast sensitivity function (CSF), than did the <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> corrections.

40|$|Ocular {{discomfort}} and dryness during <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear {{are the main}} reasons for <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> intolerance. <b>Contact</b> <b>lenses</b> have potential to trigger tear film parameter alterations, similar to those seen in dry eye. Increased tear osmolality has been associated with {{discomfort and}} ocular surface changes in dry eye. This thesis investigated both the impact of tear film and <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality on ocular discomfort during lens wear and possible ways to modulate osmolality. Vapour pressure osmometry and freezing point depression osmometry were tested for measurement agreement for tears and solutions as well as for accuracy and repeatability. Both instruments proved to be valid for clinical studies, showing deviations in osmolality only for ocular lubricants, possibly caused by preservatives. Successful development and validation of a repeatable and lens parameter independent method for measuring the osmolality of worn <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> allowed testing of the relationship between comfort and tear and <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality. Reduced comfort was associated with elevated <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality but not with tear osmolality. <b>Contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality was associated with ocular characteristics such as corneal sensitivity changes and tear film break-up time as well as lens parameters, such as lens thickness and water content. Subsequent studies tested potential ways to alter <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality to improve comfort. Increasing tear volume using punctal plugs initially decreased <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality and improved comfort but the effect was lost in the long term, possibly due to a feedback mechanism between lacrimal drainage and production. Application of hypo-osmotic drops caused a small thought non-significant <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality decrease and comfort improvement. <b>Contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality may contribute to lens-associated discomfort and provide the link between observed tear film and ocular surface changes, lens characteristics and reported comfort. Modulation of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality via external factors showed partial improvement in ocular comfort and demonstrated the potentials of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality for improving comfort Associations between the osmolality of a worn <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> and its parameters shown in this thesis suggest that alterating lens material or shape parameters to modulate <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> osmolality may benefit lens comfort...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} effects of first and second {{generation}} silicone hydrogel (SiH) <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear on tear film osmolarity. METHODS: The healthy subjects who have never used <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> before {{were enrolled in the}} study. Tear film osmolarity values of 16 eyes (group 1) who wore first generation SiH <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> were compared with those of 18 eyes (group 2) who wore second generation SiH <b>contact</b> <b>lenses</b> after three months follow-up. RESULTS: Before <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear, tear film osmolarity of groups 1 and 2 were 305. 02 ± 49. 08 milliosmole (mOsm) and 284. 66 ± 30. 18 mOsm, respectively. After three months of <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear, osmolarity values were found 317. 74 ± 60. 23 mOsm in group 1 and 298. 40 ± 37. 77 mOsm in group 2. Although osmolarity values for both groups of SiH <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear after three months periods were slightly higher than before the <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear, the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: <b>Contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear may cause evaporation from the tear film and can increase tear film osmolarity leading to symptoms of dry eye disease. In the current study, {{there is a tendency to}} increase tear film osmolarity for both groups of SiH <b>contact</b> <b>lens</b> wear, but the difference is not statistically significant...|$|R
