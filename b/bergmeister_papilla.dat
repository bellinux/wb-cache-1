40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} enhanced vitreous imaging for {{visualization of}} anatomic features and microstructures within the posterior vitreous and vitreoretinal interface in healthy eyes using swept-source {{optical coherence tomography}} (SS-OCT). The study hypothesis was that long-wavelength, high-speed, volumetric SS-OCT with software registration motion correction and vitreous window display or high-dynamic-range (HDR) display improves detection sensitivity of posterior vitreous and vitreoretinal features compared to standard OCT logarithmic scale display. Design: Observational prospective cross-sectional study. Methods: Multiple wide-field three-dimensional SS-OCT scans (5006500 A-scans over 12612 mm 2) were obtained using a prototype instrument in 22 eyes of 22 healthy volunteers. A registration motion-correction algorithm was applied to compensate motion and generate a single volumetric dataset. Each volumetric dataset was displayed in three forms: (1) standard logarithmic scale display, enhanced vitreous imaging using (2) vitreous window display and (3) HDR display. Each dataset was reviewed independently by three readers to identify features of the posterior vitreous and vitreoretinal interface. Detection sensitivities for these features were measured for each display method. Results: Features observed included the bursa premacularis (BPM), area of Martegiani, Cloquet’s/BPM septum, <b>Bergmeister</b> <b>papilla,</b> posterior cortical vitreous (hyaloid) detachment, papillomacular hyaloid detachment, hyaloid attachment to retina...|$|E

Observational prospective cross-sectional study. Multiple wide-field three-dimensional SS-OCT scans (500 × 500 A-scans over 12 × 12 mm 2) were obtained using a prototype instrument in 22 eyes of 22 healthy volunteers. A registration motion-correction algorithm was applied to compensate motion and generate a single volumetric dataset. Each volumetric dataset was displayed in three forms: (1) standard logarithmic scale display, enhanced vitreous imaging using (2) vitreous window display and (3) HDR display. Each dataset was reviewed independently by three readers to identify features of the posterior vitreous and vitreoretinal interface. Detection sensitivities for these features were measured for each display method. Features observed included the bursa premacularis (BPM), area of Martegiani, Cloquet's/BPM septum, <b>Bergmeister</b> <b>papilla,</b> posterior cortical vitreous (hyaloid) detachment, papillomacular hyaloid detachment, hyaloid attachment to retinal vessel(s), and granular opacities within vitreous cortex, Cloquet's canal, and BPM. The detection sensitivity for these features was 75. 0 % (95 %CI: 67. 8 %- 81. 1 %) using standard logarithmic scale display, 80. 6 % (95 %CI: 73. 8 %- 86. 0 %) using HDR display, and 91. 9 % (95 %CI: 86. 6 %- 95. 2 %) using vitreous window display. SS-OCT provides non-invasive, volumetric and measurable in vivo visualization of the anatomic microstructural features of the posterior vitreous and vitreoretinal interface. The vitreous window display provides the highest sensitivity for posterior vitreous and vitreoretinal interface analysis when compared to HDR and standard OCT logarithmic scale display. Enhanced vitreous imaging with SS-OCT may help assess the natural history and treatment response in vitreoretinal interface diseases...|$|E

Twenty four tests were carried out on mutant mice and five significant abnormalities were observed. [...] No homozygous mutant embryos were identified during gestation, and therefore none survived until weaning. The remaining tests were carried out on heterozygous mutant adult mice. Male heterozygotes displayed abnormal pelvic elevation in a modified SHIRPA test and have a high incidence of <b>Bergmeister's</b> <b>papilla</b> in both eyes. When the brains of heterozygous animals were studied, an absence of corpus callosum was observed.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{purpose is}} to {{document}} a case of persistent hiperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) with atypical <b>Bergmeister's</b> <b>papilla</b> and patent hialoid artery that had its conclusive diagnosis done by doppler ultrasound. We report a case of child, who had unilateral leucokoria. This child's fundoscopic examination showed a white mass on the optic nerve that extended over to adjacent retina. Performed ultrasound that remained a doubt with the following diagnostic hypotheses: persistent hiperplastic primary vitreous, granuloma (toxocara), astrocytic hamartoma and retinoblastoma. The diagnosis was only established when the doppler ultrasound showed a blood flow inside of the membrane, thus confirming the diagnosis of persistent hiperplastic primary vitreous associated with the Bergmeister'spapilla...|$|R
50|$|The hyaloid artery {{provides}} nutrition to {{the lens}} during {{development in the}} fetus, and runs forward to the lens from the optic disc. The optic disc is covered by a plaque of fibrous cells called the central supporting tissue meniscus of Kuhnt. This plaque forms a fibrous sheath around the hyaloid artery where it leaves the optic disc. At birth the hyaloid artery regresses, and is normally completely regressed {{by the time of}} eyelid opening. <b>Bergmeister’s</b> <b>papilla</b> is a remnant of the hyaloid artery fibrous sheath and is frequently observed as an incidental clinical finding.Bergmeister’s papilla is named after Austrian ophthalmologist O. Bergmeister (1845-1918).|$|R
40|$|The {{histology}} and ultrastructure of the hyaloid {{vascular system}} was studied in 16 monkeys, ages 85 days in utero to 3 years old. The well-developed hyaloid artery is identifiable ultrastructurally as an arteriole {{consisting of a}} nonfenestrated intima, a multilayered smooth muscular media, a connective tissue adventitia, and a perivascular sheath. By the fourth week after birth, the vessel walk appear hyalinized and acellular; the lumen is occluded by a thrombus. The time of the complete disappearance of the hyaloid artery varied considerably in individual monkeys; remnants of the hyaloid artery were often present on the disc (<b>Bergmeister's</b> <b>papilla)</b> in adult life. The vasa hyaloidea propria and tunica vasculosa lentis are small branches of the hyaloid artery which fill the primary vitreous. Ultrastructurally, they are Type A-l-a capillaries having a nonfenestrated endothelium, incomplete pericyte layer, and basement membranes surrounding each. Fluorescein angiography of several newborn monkeys revealed nonleakage of dye from the hyaloid artery and its branches, thus correlating {{with the presence of}} endothelial tight junctions.
