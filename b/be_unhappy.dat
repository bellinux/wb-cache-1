5|$|By {{early summer}} 1871, Morris began {{to search for}} a house outside London where his {{children}} could spend time away from the city's pollution. He settled on Kelmscott Manor in the village of Kelmscott, Oxfordshire, obtaining a joint tenancy on the building with Rossetti in June. Morris adored the building, which was constructed circa 1570, and would spend much time in the local countryside. Conversely, Rossetti would <b>be</b> <b>unhappy</b> at Kelmscott, and eventually suffered a mental breakdown. Morris divided his time between London and Kelmscott, however when Rossetti was there he would not spend more than three days at a time at the latter. He was also fed up with his family home in Queen Square, deciding to obtain a new house in London. Although retaining a personal bedroom and study at Queen Square, he relocated his family to Horrington House in Turnham Green Road, West London, in January 1873. This allowed him to be far closer to the home of Burne-Jones, with the duo meeting on almost every Sunday morning for the rest of Morris' life.|$|E

25|$|The Mongolian Revolution of 1911 (Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1911) {{occurred}} when the region of Outer Mongolia declared its independence from the Manchu-led Qing dynasty during the Xinhai Revolution.

When a new program to colonize Mongolia with Han Chinese and assimilate the natives was unveiled, it was met with resistance {{that resulted in a}} relatively bloodless separation from the Qing Empire.

25|$|AAS users tend to <b>be</b> <b>unhappy</b> {{with the}} {{portrayal}} of AAS as deadly {{in the media and}} in politics. According to one study, AAS users also distrust their physicians and in the sample 56% had not disclosed their AAS use to their physicians. Another 2007 study had similar findings, showing that, while 66% of individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes were willing to seek medical supervision for their steroid use, 58% lacked trust in their physicians, 92% felt that the medical community's knowledge of non-medical AAS use was lacking, and 99% felt that the public has an exaggerated view of the side-effects of AAS use. A recent study has also shown that long term AAS users {{were more likely to have}} symptoms of muscle dysmorphia and also showed stronger endorsement of more conventional male roles. A recent study in the Journal of Health Psychology showed that many users believed that steroids used in moderation were safe.|$|E

25|$|The {{scheduling}} of Panorama has, {{since the}} 1980s, often been {{a subject of}} media debate and controversy, due to {{the duties of the}} BBC to provide both on the one hand entertaining programming that appeals to a mass audience, and on the other serious journalism that might have a narrower audience. In February 1985, with the programme being watched by an average audience of just 3.5million viewers, Controller of BBC One Michael Grade moved the programme from its traditional prime time 8.10pm slot on Monday evenings back to 9.30pm, after the Nine O'Clock News. Despite many protests about this move in the media, Panorama remained in this slot until 1997, although two of Grade's successors, Alan Yenotob and Michael Jackson, were known to <b>be</b> <b>unhappy</b> about running 70 continuous minutes of news from 9pm. In May 1997 the Acting Controller of BBC One, Mark Thompson, did move Panorama back half an hour to 10pm, {{to make way for the}} sitcom Birds of a Feather, which opened the BBC to criticism that it was side-lining serious content in favour of lighter programming.|$|E

500|$|When a final {{agreement}} was reached with the Republican legislative leadership, Dayton called a special session of the legislature on July 19. The legislature met on July 20 and passed the budget bills, which were signed the same day by the governor. Most state employees returned to work on July 21, facing a backlog of unfinished work and new problems in many agencies. After the budget was passed, Dayton said he approached Republicans again after meeting with ordinary citizens—who said they wanted government services to resume and did not care how the shutdown was ended—and because he feared a worse budget deal and unease in the DFL legislative minorities. Zellers said when the deal was finalized that in his view it was [...] "a deal {{that we can all}} be disappointed in, but a deal that is done, a budget that was balanced". His sentiments that a 'balanced' budget needed to be passed, and that both sides had something to <b>be</b> <b>unhappy</b> about, were echoed by Koch.|$|E
500|$|In {{reward for}} his action against Révolutionnaire, Nagle {{was made a}} Knight Bachelor, and First Lieutenant Robert Dudley Oliver was {{promoted}} to commander. Pellew, in his report on the action, stated that [...] "the cripped state of the Enemy allows me the Opportunity of saying, that her Resiliance could have been of no Avail, had the Artois been alone", but historian William James was more reserved, noting in 1827 that the ships [...] "would have been a well matched pair of combatants, had the Artois been alone." [...] The prize money was extensive: part payment of £10,000 (£ as of [...] ) was made in January 1795, the reward shared between the entire squadron. Pellew, who had been knighted the previous year following the Action of 18 June 1793, was reported to <b>be</b> <b>unhappy</b> that Nagle had been honoured {{for his part in}} this action and complained to the Admiralty about the condition and speed of Arethusa, requesting a faster vessel. The following year he would receive command of the 44-gun razee HMS Indefatigable as a result.|$|E
500|$|Coddington {{continued}} to <b>be</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the consolidated government, and wanted colonial independence {{for the two}} island towns. [...] He sailed to England to present his case, and in April 1651, the Council of State of England gave him the commission he sought, making him governor-for-life of the island. [...] Criticism of Coddington arose {{as soon as he}} returned with his commission. [...] Three men were then directed to go to England to get Coddington's commission revoked: [...] Roger Williams, representing the mainland towns, and John Clarke and William Dyer representing the two island towns. In November 1651 the three men left for England, where Dyer would meet his wife. [...] Mary Dyer had sailed to England before the three men departed, as Coddington {{wrote in a letter to}} Winthrop that Mr. Dyer [...] "sent his wife over in the first ship with Mr. Travice, and is now gone himself for England." [...] It remains a mystery as to why Mary Dyer would leave six children behind, one an infant, to travel abroad. [...] Biographer Ruth Plimpton hinted that Mary had some royal connection, and suggested that the news of the execution of King Charles compelled her to go. [...] However, no record has been found to satisfactorily explain this mystery.|$|E
