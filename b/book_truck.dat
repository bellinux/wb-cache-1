Resnick took it on himself to compile an online directory of food trucks and carts across the US. Resnick did not initially have a business model. As people began to seek his help to <b>book</b> <b>trucks</b> for events, and marketing campaigns, Resnick realized that he could turn his online directory into a business.|$|R

40|$|Nonfiction {{trade book}} use in primary grades Nonfiction {{has been a}} small part of primary-grade {{instruction}} due, in part, to the lack of quality books written for this level.

During a classroom visit at the beginning ofthe school year, we (the authors) noticed afirst grader holding a basket of five “true” books she had chosen for independent reading time. One book was about kites. We asked her why she chose it, and she said, “We have about five kites at home. ” A second <b>book</b> described <b>trucks</b> and a third discussed picking apples and pumpkins...|$|R

5000|$|Truck stops {{were often}} {{depicted}} in films and novels as being somewhat seedy places, frequented by aggressive bikers, petty criminals, and prostitutes (e.g. the [...] "lot lizards" [...] in the JT LeRoy novel Sarah). This {{might be an}} outdated stereotype, as most modern truck stops are generally clean and safe, becoming a [...] "home away from home" [...] for many truck drivers. However, most truck stops reflect the social environment of their local area; consequently, one occasionally finds seedy truck stops in seedy areas. According to John McPhee's <b>book</b> Uncommon Carriers, <b>truck</b> stops in rural areas are typically very safe and wholesome. However, as the distance to major cities decrease the incidence of prostitution, drug peddling etc. increases dramatically. The Vince Lombardi service area on the New Jersey Turnpike near New York City has the most rampant prostitution.|$|R
50|$|Carroll {{was born}} in Washington, D.C., to Thomas Edmund and Marea Grace Carroll on September 27, 1969. He {{attended}} Columbia University in New York City, receiving his bachelor's degree in history in 1993. In May 1992, while a junior at Columbia, Carroll {{was inspired by a}} lecture by the Joseph Brodsky (the Nobel Prize-winning Poet Laureate of the United States) to found the American Poetry and Literacy Project (APLP). Meeting in a Greenwich Village café in late 1992, Carroll and Brodsky decided that the APLP would distribute poetry books for free to members of the public. Carroll, APLP's executive director, persuaded the Book-of-the-Month Club to donate thousands of copies of poetry books to the APLP. The books were distributed in hotels, hospitals, and homeless shelters and aboard airlines. By 1994, more than 12,500 poetry books had been distributed. Another 15,000 books were given away in 1997. Carroll went on a nationwide tour sponsored by the Academy of American Poets in 1998, promoting the APLP and distributing 100,000 free poetry <b>books</b> at <b>truck</b> stops, hospital waiting rooms, train stations, and jury rooms in courthouses. Volkswagen later paid APLP to put 40,000 poetry books in the glove boxes of its cars in April 1999, and Target Corporation paid APLP for 300,000 books to give away to their customers. Another 100,000 copies of poetry books were distributed at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. In early 1998, he edited the poetry anthology 101 Great American Poems.|$|R
5000|$|... "Any {{reorganization}} of the existing bookmobile service will be difficult. At present, local librarians enjoy selecting books for loan to their libraries directly from the bookmobile; and residents of outlying sections of the community like the 'curb service' which the bookmobile provides. However, libraries could receive adequate service more economically by weekly checking of new books lists, and weekly distribution of <b>books</b> by delivery <b>truck.</b> It is an expensive procedure to service local libraries by a bookmobile staffed with a trained librarian. Moreover {{in this era of}} good roads, and in an area such as this where distances are comparatively short, local residents should be able to secure books from their local library if it is open sufficient hours. If a bookmobile from a state-financed regional center makes numerous stops in a town, it competes with and weakens the local library, instead of strengthening it. I should recommend that eventually a state-operated bookmobile either be superseded entirely by delivery truck service to local libraries or that it stops be limited to schools... On the other hand if it is possible for school children to visit the local library during a noon hour or to visit as a class group during school hours, it would seem preferable to provide books and professional assistance through the library, rather than through a bookmobile".|$|R
