40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate production of Sweet Grape mini tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum Mill.) using culture substrates and nutrient solution sewage effluent, applied by drip irrigation (fertigation). The experiment was conducted at the University of Goiás State (UEG-UnUCET), from June to November 2011 in Anápolis-GO, Brazil. The experimental design was a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement in a randomized complete block design with four repetitions. The plots were made by combining two nutrient solutions, effluent supplemented with mineral fertilizers (EcS); conventional nutrient solution (SnC); in addition three cultivation substrates: 60 % of fine sand washed + 40 % substrate composed by 20 % coconut fiber plus 80 % pine <b>bark</b> (<b>S</b> 1); 20 % coconut fiber and 80 % pine <b>bark</b> (<b>S</b> 2) and natural coconut fiber (S 3).

40|$|Background: Saraca asoca (Roxb.) Wilde (Fabaceae) is a {{high valued}} but {{vulnerable}} medicinal plant of Western Ghats region. This plant is mainly known for its use in various gynecological disorders. Objective: The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate seasonal variation of the polyphenolic compounds viz., epicatechin and gallic acid in the <b>bark</b> of <b>S.</b> asoca by using Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Diode Array Detector (RP-HPLC-DAD) method. Materials and Methods: The bark was collected in six different Ritu (season) viz. Varsha (monsoon), Sharad (autumn), hemant (early winter), Shishir (winter), Vasanta (spring), and Grishma (summer) mentioned in Ayurveda. Results : The RP-HPLC-DAD analysis indicated that levels of epicatechin and gallic acid in the <b>bark</b> of <b>S.</b> asoca vary seasonally. The highest concentration of epicatechin was observed in Shishir Ritu (3315. 19 ± 165. 76 mg/ 100 g) and gallic acid during Hemant Ritu (211. 90 ± 10. 60 mg/ 100 g). Conclusions: In present study, the ability to synthesize and accumulate both the compounds in <b>bark</b> of <b>S.</b> asoca varied greatly throughout the seasons.

That cold water is used for cooling of the air during daytime. By small modification during daytime, solar panels could be turned into collectors and used to produce the hot water that is collected in a separate tank.
