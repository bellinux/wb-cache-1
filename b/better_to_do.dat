5|$|The Phantom Tollbooth is a children's fantasy {{adventure}} novel written by Norton Juster with illustrations by Jules Feiffer, published in 1961 by Random House (USA). It {{tells the story}} of a bored young boy named Milo who unexpectedly receives a magic tollbooth one afternoon and, having nothing <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> drives through it in his toy car, transporting him to the Kingdom of Wisdom, once prosperous but now troubled. There, he acquires two faithful companions and goes on a quest to restore to the kingdom its exiled princesses—named Rhyme and Reason—from the Castle in the Air. In the process, he learns valuable lessons, finding a love of learning. The text is full of puns and wordplay, such as when Milo unintentionally jumps to Conclusions, an island in Wisdom, thus exploring the literal meanings of idioms.|$|E

25|$|In polyphasic sleep, an {{organism}} sleeps {{several times in}} a 24-hour cycle. Monophasic sleep occurs all at once. Under experimental conditions, humans tend to alternate more frequently between sleep and wakefulness (i.e., exhibit more polyphasic sleep) if they have nothing <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Given a 14-hour period of darkness in experimental conditions, humans tended towards bimodal sleep, with two sleep periods concentrated {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the dark time. Bimodal sleep in humans was more common before the industrial revolution.|$|E

25|$|Lack of {{meaningful}} alternatives, such as affordable schools and quality education, according to ILO, is another major factor driving children to harmful labour. Children work {{because they have}} nothing <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Many communities, particularly rural areas where between 60–70% of child labour is prevalent, do not possess adequate school facilities. Even when schools are sometimes available, they are too far away, difficult to reach, unaffordable or {{the quality of education}} is so poor that parents wonder if going to school is really worth it.|$|E

He was sitting outside the Cooper Union one day when {{the principal of the}} school where he had earlier learned telegraphy happened to notice him. He said that if Riis had nothing <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> then the New York News Association was looking for a trainee. After one more night and a hurried wash in a horse trough, Riis went for an interview. Despite his disheveled appearance he was sent for a test assignment: to observe and write about a luncheon at the Astor House. Riis covered the event competently and got the job.|$|E

Demare {{travelled}} to Salta to reconnoiter the area. Later, the crew and equipment moved to an old estate and big house. They worked on a big ballroom and had two small rooms; each crewman had a cot and an upside down beer wooden box as night-stand. The actresses and Enrique Muiño, due to his age, stayed in a hotel.|$|E

500|$|Pilotwings 64 {{has been}} criticized for lacking {{innovative}} gameplay. The New York Times writer Ashley Dunn characterized the game's E3 demonstration as [...] "brain-dead" [...] in its gameplay and suggested that even young children would rather fly a dragon on the Sony PlayStation. Game Revolution issued Pilotwings 64 a particularly harsh review score, declaring the game to be nothing more than a graphical showcase for those with nothing <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> The sound effects present in the game were impressive to several reviewers, but the soundtrack has been negatively compared to lounge music and porn groove, although the 'Birdman' track was highly rated.|$|E

[...] Between her junior and senior year of high school, she shaved her head and sold her hair to a Broadway wigmaker. She openly {{admitted}} to using drugs as a teenager, especially hallucinogens. She has commented that her father was aware of her experimentation with hallucinogens and marijuana, and even told her that it was okay, but that she had [...] "to stop if she had bad trips". Despite her father's leniency, her mother later chose to send her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In 2007, she told The Times that [...] "I had a great family life [...] I would never want it to look as if it reflected on them. I think I was very bored, and I did just love taking hallucinogens... but I often feel it's because I experimented when I was younger that I have no interest as an adult. I know a lot of adults who didn't, and it's much more dangerous when you start experimenting with drugs as an adult." [...] She often described herself as a [...] "loner" [...] and a [...] "depressed teenager". Her only extracurricular activity was occasionally skateboarding with her older brother, and she spent most of her free time in her bedroom: [...] "Mostly I sewed. I had nothing <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> so I made my own clothes." ...|$|E

500|$|The Mets won the National League East by [...] {{games in}} 1986, but the Phillies {{were the only}} team to post a winning record against them, {{including}} winning 7 of 9 at Veterans Stadium. On September 12, up by 22 games, the Mets came to Philadelphia for a three game weekend series needing one win to clinch the division. The Mets brought champagne to Philadelphia. Before the series, Mets manager Davey Johnson told the Associated Press, [...] "It will be nice to clinch in Philadelphia. It gives {{us a chance to}} beat the only team in our way...I have a nice warm feeling about this." [...] He told The Philadelphia Inquirer: [...] "For the fans...it would be nicer to clinch at home. But for the safety...and the livelihood of the players...it's <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it on the road." [...] In the series opener, Mike Schmidt hit a three-run homer, Phillies rookie Bruce Ruffin out pitched the Mets' Dwight Gooden, and the Phillies won, 6–3. The Phillies won the second game of the series, 6–5; visiting Mets fans became unruly and damaged seats in the upper deck. One Mets fan was arrested after hitting two Philadelphia police officers. The Phillies completed the sweep by beating the Mets, 6–0, behind a shutout from Kevin Gross, drove in two runs with a fourth-inning triple. The Mets would clinch the division at Shea Stadium on September 17. After the season, the Phils' Schmidt won the National League MVP Award, ahead of the Mets' Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez who finished third and fourth.|$|E

2500|$|Copland {{maintained}} a regular daily schedule. He awoke, had a light breakfast, {{and took care}} of his correspondence in the morning. After lunch he received visitors, including the many younger composers he aided over the years, a personal generosity that led to him being called [...] "The Dean of American Composers". Dinner would come in the evening, and only at night, when he felt it was <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, did he actually compose. In this way he composed Connotations and Inscape, large orchestral works for the New York Philharmonic, and Duo for Flute and Piano, his last major work, in 1971. Shortly after moving in he wrote his last film score, for the 1961 independent film Something Wild. In his later years Rock Hill served primarily as a base for his travels, which included many appearances guest-conducting his work at performances all over the world, and receiving honorary degrees and awards.|$|E
2500|$|Hippias Minor (...) , or On Lying, {{is thought}} to be one of Plato's early works. Socrates matches wits with an arrogant polymath, who is also a smug {{literary}} critic. Hippias believes that Homer can be taken at face value, and he also thinks that Achilles may be believed when he says he hates liars, whereas Odysseus' resourceful (...) behavior stems from his ability to lie well (365b). Socrates argues that Achilles is a cunning liar who throws people off the scent of his own deceptions and that cunning liars are actually the [...] "best" [...] liars. Consequently, Odysseus was equally false and true and so was Achilles (369b). Socrates proposes, possibly for the sheer dialectical fun of it, that it is <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> evil voluntarily than involuntarily. His case rests largely on the analogy with athletic skills, such as running and wrestling. [...] He says that a runner or wrestler who deliberately sandbags is better than the one who plods along because he can do no better.|$|E

[...] The most delightful part of the spy film turned out to be its first act, set in a city created by and for animals. [...] To focus on the all-animal city, Howard eventually dropped the 1960s setting, along with the espionage and international aspects, which caused the film to evolve into a contemporary police procedural in which Nick Wilde was the lead role and Judy Hopps was essentially his sidekick. For a while, [...] "the filmmakers were very committed" [...] to that version of the story, but then in November 2014, the filmmakers realized the film's plot would be more engaging if they reversed the roles to instead focus on Hopps as opposed to Wilde. The change in perspective caused several characters to be dropped, including two characters known as [...] "The Gerbil Jerks" [...] who were described as [...] "trust-fund gerbils that had nothing <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> than harass Nick." ...|$|E
