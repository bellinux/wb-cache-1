25|$|Dudhwa National Park: It covers {{an area of}} 500km2 {{along the}} Indo-Nepal border in Lakhimpur Kheri {{district}} of Uttar Pradesh, {{is best known for}} the <b>barasingha</b> or swamp deer. The grasslands and woodlands of this park, consist mainly of sal forests. The <b>barasingha</b> is found in the southwest and southeast regions of the park. Among the big cats, tigers abound at Dudhwa. There are also a few leopards. The other animals found in large numbers, are the Indian rhinoceros, elephant, jungle cats, leopard cats, fishing cats, jackals, civets, sloth bears, sambar, otters, crocodiles and chital.|$|E
25|$|The {{swamp deer}} or <b>barasingha</b> {{was found in}} Mehrgarh in Baluchistan till 300 BC and {{probably}} became locally extinct due to over-hunting and loss of riverine habitat to cultivation. A species of wild cattle, Bos primegenius nomadicus or the zebu vanished early on from its range in the Indus basin and western India, possibly due to inter-breeding with domestic cattle and resultant fragmentation of wild populations due to loss of habitat.|$|E
25|$|Tigers are carnivores. They prefer hunting large {{ungulates}} such as chital, sambar, gaur, and to {{a lesser}} extent also <b>barasingha,</b> water buffalo, nilgai, serow and takin. Among the medium-sized prey species they frequently kill wild boar, and occasionally hog deer, muntjac and grey langur. Small prey species such as porcupines, hares and peafowl form a very small part in their diet. Because of the encroachment of humans into their habitat, they also prey on domestic livestock.|$|E
25|$|The {{endangered}} species that {{live within the}} Sundarbans and extinct species {{that used to be}} include the royal Bengal tigers, estuarine crocodile, northern river terrapins (Batagur baska), olive ridley sea turtles, Gangetic dolphin, ground turtles, hawksbill sea turtles and king crabs (horse shoe). Some species such as hog deer (Axis porcinus), water buffalos (Bubalus bubalis), <b>barasingha</b> or swamp deer (Cervus duvauceli), Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus), single horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) and the mugger crocodiles or marsh crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris) started to become extinct in the Sundarbans towards the middle of the 20th century, because of extensive poaching and man hunting by the British. There are other threatened mammal species, such as the capped langurs (Semnopithecus pileatus), smooth-coated otters (Lutrogale perspicillata), Oriental small-clawed otters (Aonyx cinerea), and great Bengal civets (Viverra zibetha).|$|E
25|$|Assam has {{wildlife}} sanctuaries, {{the most}} prominent of which are two UNESCO World Heritage sites-the Kaziranga National Park, {{on the bank of the}} Brahmaputra River, and the Manas Wildlife Sanctuary, near the border with Bhutan. The Kaziranga is a refuge for the fast-disappearing Indian one-horned rhinoceros. The state is the last refuge for numerous other endangered and threatened species including the white-winged wood duck or deohanh, Bengal florican, black-breasted parrotbill, red-headed vulture, white-rumped vulture, greater adjutant, Jerdon's babbler, rufous-necked hornbill, Bengal tiger, Asian elephant, pygmy hog, gaur, wild water buffalo, Indian hog deer, hoolock gibbon, golden langur, capped langur, <b>barasingha,</b> Ganges river dolphin, Barca snakehead, Ganges shark, Burmese python, brahminy river turtle, black pond turtle, Asian forest tortoise, and Assam roofed turtle. Threatened species that are extinct in Assam include the gharial, a critically endangered fish-eating crocodilian, and the pink-headed duck (which may be extinct worldwide). For the state bird, the white-winged wood duck, Assam is a globally important area. In addition to the above, there are three other National Parks in Assam namely Dibru Saikhowa National Park, Nameri National Park and the Orang National Park.|$|E
500|$|In the wild, tigers mostly feed {{on large}} and {{medium-sized}} animals, preferring native ungulates weighing at least [...] They typically {{have little or}} no deleterious effect on their prey populations. Sambar deer, chital, <b>barasingha,</b> wild boar, gaur, nilgai and both water buffalo and domestic buffalo, in descending order of preference, are the tiger's favoured prey in Tamil Nadu, India, while gaur and sambar are the preferred prey and constitute the main diet of tigers in other parts of India. They also prey on other predators, including dogs, leopards, pythons, sloth bears, and crocodiles.|$|E
2500|$|The male rhino {{was joined}} by a female in 2008 to form a pair which the zoo hoped would breed. Sadly in November 2009 the male Indian rhino [...] "Patna" [...] was put down due to a longstanding leg injury. The zoo {{obtained}} a replacement male from Edinburgh Zoo in March 2010. Since they were closely related the previous female departed for a zoo in Spain shortly after, and the zoo are in the progress of creating a breeding situation– Baabu has now been exchanged for 'Beni' from Pilsen Zoo. The paddocks formerly housed <b>barasingha,</b> Ankole cattle, blackbuck and sitatunga.|$|E
50|$|An {{exciting}} conservation {{effort in}} this national park is the reintroduction of <b>barasingha.</b> The gaur will be relocated to Bandhavgarh and some <b>barasingha</b> will be relocated to Satpura Tiger Reserve The {{objective of this}} project is to introduce about 500 <b>barasingha</b> in this national park to eight or nine different locations. There is also a project to capture about twenty tigers and relocate them to Satpura Tiger Reserve.|$|E

5000|$|The {{swamp deer}} differs {{from all the}} Indian deer species in that the antlers carry more than three tines.

50|$|The highest {{concentration}} of large deer {{species in the}} tropics occurs in Southern Asia in India's Indo-Gangetic Plain Region and Nepal's Terai Region. These fertile plains consist of tropical seasonal moist deciduous, dry deciduous forests, and {{both dry and wet}} savannas that are home to chital, hog deer, <b>barasingha,</b> Indian sambar, and Indian muntjac. Grazing species such as the endangered <b>barasingha</b> and very common chital are gregarious and live in large herds. Indian sambar can be gregarious but are usually solitary or live in smaller herds. Hog deer are solitary and have lower densities than Indian muntjac. Deer can be seen in several national parks in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka of which Kanha National Park, Dudhwa National Park, and Chitwan National Park are most famous. Sri Lanka's Wilpattu National Park and Yala National Park have large herds of Indian sambar and chital. The Indian sambar are more gregarious in Sri Lanka than other parts of their range and tend to form larger herds than elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|Kanha, Bandhavgarh, Pench, Panna, and Satpura National Parks {{are managed}} as Project Tiger areas. The National Chambal Sanctuary is managed for {{conservation}} of gharial and mugger, river dolphin, smooth-coated otter {{and a number}} of turtle species. Ken-gharial and Son-gharial sanctuaries are managed for conservation of gharial and mugger. The <b>barasingha</b> is the state animal and the dudhraj is the state bird of Madhya Pradesh.|$|E

50|$|This deer was {{a graceful}} species similar in {{appearance}} to the <b>barasingha.</b> The pelt {{was a dark}} brown with lighter underparts. The underside of the tail was white. Males possessed basket-like antlers, upon which all the main tines branched. This caused the deer to have up to 33 points on their antlers and {{the outer edge of}} the rack to be up to 35 in long. Females had no antlers.|$|E
