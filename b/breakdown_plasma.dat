This article appeared in the Journal of Applied Physics and may be found at: [URL] breakdown discharges are one probable failure mechanism of metallized polymeric film capacitors used in power systems, traction drives, and other technological applications. To assess whether surface breakdown discharges may undergo considerable elongation on the electrode surface to affect significantly capacitor performance, an equivalent electric circuit model is developed for metallized polymer film capacitors under the thermal equilibrium condition. With the aid of a surface field gradient mechanism, propagation of surface plasmas is studied and the necessary condition for their possible elongation is obtained. Numerical examples of a metallized film capacitor are used to demonstrate that surface <b>breakdown</b> <b>plasmas</b> and their elongation are unlikely to affect capacitor performance in a significant fashion. Then the generic problem of plasma propagation is restudied under thermally nonequilibrium conditions. Based on a heat conduction formulation in the one-dimensional limit, a temperature gradient mechanism is proposed to explain the possible elongation of <b>breakdown</b> <b>plasmas</b> on an electrode surface.

40|$|Ripples {{are formed}} {{on the surface}} of solid {{materials}} after interaction with laser pulses of high intensity/irradiance. When ultra-short sub- 1 ps laser pulses are used, the observed morphology of ripples on surfaces becomes much more complex as compared with ripples formed by long laser pulses. Uniquely for the short laser pulses, ripples can be formed in the bulk. A better understanding of the fundamentals of light-matter interaction in ripples formation is strongly required. Experimentally observed ripples and dependence of their parameters on laser fabrication conditions and material properties are summarized first. Then, a critical review of relevant ripple formation mechanisms is presented, discussed, and formation conjectures are presented. It is shown that formation of plasma at sub-critical or critical densities (i. e., solid state or <b>breakdown</b> <b>plasmas)</b> on the surface and in the bulk specific to the high-intensity ultra-short laser pulses has to be considered to account for the experimental observations.

A near infrared pulsed nanosecond laser is used for exposure of colloidal solution of Au nanoparticles suspended in water. Laser exposure of the colloidal solution results in formation of plasma of laser breakdown of liquid and emission of H 2. The rate of H 2 emission depends critically on the energy of laser pulses.

The mechanical and thermal effects of the confined plasma and water <b>breakdown</b> <b>plasma</b> during laser ablation in water have not been fully investigated as well. ^ In this work, nanosecond laser ablation of metal targets in air and water is investigated through a self-contained hydrodynamic model under different laser fluences with the consideration of phase explosion. In case of nanosecond laser ablation of aluminum in water, deeper crater depths are found in all the conditions studied in this work. The analysis of the shock compression in air and water indicates that the shock compression is mainly responsible for this enhancement of ablation in water. ^ The mechanical effects of confined plasma is also investigated, including the target surface integrity change and induced residual stresses in the Laser shock peening (LSP) process and shock wave propagation and spallation behavior in LSP. By combining a 3 -D finite element model with a previously developed confined plasma model, the residual stresses induced in the substrate material as well as the indentation profile on the substrate surface are predicted for both single shot and overlapping LSP. The spallation induced by shock wave propagation in targets during the laser shock peening process is also investigated in this work. The spallation zone location is calculated for various materials with different thickness of foils and various laser shock peening parameters and validated against with previously reported experimental results. ^ The melt ejection behavior during nanosecond laser ablation with phase explosion is successfully predicted by combined molecular dynamics (MD) and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations and validated against the experiments.
