25|$|Different {{medications}} are {{tried in}} an effort to find a combination that is effective for a specific person. Not all people will respond well to the same medications. Medications that have had positive results in some include: diphenhydramine, <b>benzatropine</b> and atropine. anti-Parkinsons agents (such as ropinirole and bromocriptine), and muscle relaxants (such as diazepam).|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzatropine</b> is an {{anticholinergic}} drug used {{in patients}} {{to reduce the}} side effects of antipsychotic treatment. <b>Benzatropine</b> is also a second-line drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It improves tremor, and may alleviate rigidity and bradykinesia. <b>Benzatropine</b> is also sometimes used for the treatment of dystonia, a rare disorder that causes abnormal muscle contraction, resulting in twisting postures of limbs, trunk, or face. In veterinary medicine, <b>benzatropine</b> is used to treat priapism in stallions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzatropine</b> {{has been}} also identified, {{by a high}} {{throughput}} screening approach, as a potent differentiating agent for oligodendrocytes, possibly working through M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors. In preclinical models for multiple sclerosis, <b>benzatropine</b> decreased clinical symptoms and enhanced re-myelination.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzatropine</b> is a {{centrally}} acting anticholinergic/antihistamine agent. It is {{a selective}} M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. <b>Benzatropine</b> partially blocks cholinergic {{activity in the}} basal ganglia and {{has also been shown}} to increase the availability of dopamine by blocking its reuptake and storage in central sites, and as a result, increasing dopaminergic activity. Animal studies have indicated that anticholinergic activity of <b>benzatropine</b> is approximately one-half that of atropine, while its antihistamine activity approaches that of mepyramine. Its anticholinergic effects have been established as therapeutically significant in the management of Parkinsonism. <b>Benzatropine</b> antagonizes the effect of acetylcholine, decreasing the imbalance between the neurotransmitters acetylcholine and dopamine, which may improve the symptoms of early Parkinson's disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzatropine</b> also {{acts as a}} {{functional}} inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA).|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzatropine</b> analogues are {{atypical}} dopamine reuptake inhibitors, {{which might}} make them useful {{for people with}} akathisia secondary to antipsychotic therapy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzatropine</b> (INN), {{also known}} as benztropine (USAN, BAN), is an {{anticholinergic}} marketed under the trade name Cogentin which {{is used in the}} treatment of Parkinson's disease, Parkinsonism, and dystonia.|$|E
50|$|Etybenzatropine (INN), {{also known}} as ethybenztropine (USAN, BAN) and tropethydrylin, is an anticholinergic/antihistamine marketed under the trade names Panolid, Ponalid, and Ponalide, which is used as an {{antiparkinsonian}} agent. Like its analogue <b>benzatropine,</b> it may act as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor.|$|E
50|$|Dystonic {{reactions}} may {{be treated}} with <b>benzatropine,</b> diphenhydramine, trihexyphenidyl, or procyclidine. Symptoms usually subside with diphenhydramine injected intramuscularly. Agents in the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be helpful, but benefits are usually modest and side effects of sedation and weakness can be problematic.|$|E
50|$|Another drug {{similarly}} named JHW-007 (not JWH) is a cocaine analogue (the di-para-fluoro benztropine, being {{essentially a}} hybrid between <b>benzatropine</b> & difluoropine; with fluorine {{groups in the}} former or being descarbmethoxy in the latter) and atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor, but is distinct from and {{not the same as}} this JWH-007.|$|E
50|$|Anticholinergics like <b>benzatropine</b> {{alleviate}} dystonia symptoms {{by blocking}} reuptake of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine {{is involved in}} the pathophysiology of dystonia within the basal ganglia, although its exact role has not been determined. Acetylcholine is involved with dopamine and glutamate pathways in the basal ganglia, in addition to presynaptic muscarinic receptors which are involved in motor control. Acetylcholine is usually overactive in dystonia patients and blocking of this neurotransmitter would reduce contortion of the upper body, but can produce side effects of drowsiness, confusion and memory issues in adults.|$|E
50|$|Sulpiride has a {{relatively}} low order of acute toxicity. Substantial amounts may cause severe but reversible dystonic crises with torticollis, protrusion of the tongue, and/or trismus. In some cases all the classical symptoms typical of severe Parkinson's disease may be noted; in others, over-sedation/coma may occur. The treatment is largely symptomatic. Some or all extrapyramidal reactions may respond to the application of anticholinergic drugs such as biperiden or <b>benzatropine.</b> All patients should be closely monitored for signs of long QT syndrome and severe arrhythmias.|$|E
50|$|Prescription {{medications}} called anticholinergics, {{taken by}} mouth, are sometimes {{used in the}} treatment of both generalized and focal hyperhidrosis. Anticholinergics used for hyperhidrosis include propantheline, glycopyrronium bromide or glycopyrrolate, oxybutynin, methantheline, and <b>benzatropine.</b> Use of these drugs can be limited, however, by side-effects, including dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, and visual disturbances such as mydriasis (dilation of the pupils) and cycloplegia. For people who find their hyperhidrosis is made worse by anxiety-provoking situations (public speaking, stage performances, special events such as weddings, etc.), taking an anticholinergic medicine before the event may be helpful.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{drugs have}} DRI action {{and have been}} or are used clinically specifically for this property: amineptine, dexmethylphenidate, difemetorex, fencamfamine, lefetamine, levophacetoperane, medifoxamine, mesocarb, methylphenidate, nomifensine, pipradrol, prolintane, and pyrovalerone. The following drugs are or have been used clinically and possess only weak DRI action, {{which may or may}} not be clinically-relevant: adrafinil, armodafinil, bupropion, mazindol, modafinil, nefazodone, sertraline, and sibutramine. The following drugs are or have been clinically used but only coincidentally have DRI properties: <b>benzatropine,</b> diphenylpyraline, etybenzatropine, ketamine, nefopam, pethidine (meperidine), and tripelennamine. The following are a selection of some particularly notably abused DRIs: cocaine, ketamine, MDPV, naphyrone, and phencyclidine (PCP). Amphetamines, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cathinone, methcathinone, mephedrone, and methylone, are all DRIs as well, but are distinct in that they also behave, and potentially more potently as dopamine releasing agents (DRAs) (it should be noted that due to Yerkes-Dodson's law, 'more potently stimulated' may not equal more optimally functionally stimulated). There are very distinct differences in the mode of action between dopamine releasers/substrates & dopamine re-uptake inhibitors; the former are functionally entropy-driven (i.e. relating to hydrophobicity) and the latter are enthalpy-driven (i.e. relating conformational change). Reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine induce hyperpolarization of cloned human DAT upon oocytes that are naturally found on neurons, whereas releasing agents induce de-polarization of the neuron membrane.|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{describe}} the computational ("in silico") mode-of-action analysis of CNS-active drugs, which is taking both multiple simultaneous hypotheses as well as sets of protein targets for each mode-of-action into account, and which was followed by successful prospective in vitro and in vivo validation. Using sleep-related phenotypic readouts describing both efficacy and side effects for 491 compounds tested in rat, we defined an "optimal" (desirable) sleeping pattern. Compounds were subjected to in silico target prediction (which was experimentally confirmed for 21 out of 28 cases), followed by the utilization of decision trees for deriving polypharmacological bioactivity profiles. We demonstrated that predicted bioactivities improved classification performance compared to using only structural information. Moreover, DrugBank molecules were processed via the same pipeline, and compounds in many cases not annotated as sedative-hypnotic (alcaftadine, <b>benzatropine,</b> palonosetron, ecopipam, cyproheptadine, sertindole, and clopenthixol) were prospectively validated in vivo. Alcaftadine, ecopipam cyproheptadine, and clopenthixol were found to promote sleep as predicted, <b>benzatropine</b> showed only a small increase in NREM sleep, whereas sertindole promoted wakefulness. To our knowledge, the sedative-hypnotic effects of alcaftadine and ecopipam have not been previously discussed in the literature. The method described extends previous single-target, single-mode-of-action models and is applicable across disease areas. This {{research was supported by}} Unilever (A. B.), the EPSRC (G.

40|$|Pituitary {{cells were}} cultured as {{three-dimensional}} reaggregates in serum-free chemically defined medium supplemented with different concentrations of dexamethasone. Immunostaining {{of the cells}} using a polyclonal antiserum and three monoclonal antibodies raised against choline acetyl transferase (CAT), revealed the presence of CAT immunoreactivity in 4 - 10 % of anterior pituitary cells depending on the antibody used. CAT immunoreactivity was also found in freshly dispersed anterior pituitary cells. CAT-immunoreactive cells could be enriched on BSA and Percoll gradients and codistributed with ACTH-immunoreactive cells in these gradients. Perifusion of the aggregates with the potent muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (Atr) resulted in a dose-dependent (0. 1 - 100 nM) increase in both basal PRL and GH secretion; the response was dependent on the dexamethasone concentration in the culture medium. A similar response to Atr was observed in organ-cultured pituitaries. The specificity of the Atr effect {{was supported by the}} findings that the potent and highly specific muscarinic receptor blocker dexetimide showed a similar action, whereas its inactive enantiomer levetimide and the nicotinic receptor blocker hexamethonium failed to do so. Two other muscarinic antagonists, <b>benzatropine</b> and pirenzepine, showed a dose-dependent hormone-releasing action similar to that of Atr, but were less potent than the latter. Pirenzepine was only effective at high molar concentrations, suggesting that an M 2 muscarinic receptor subtype was mediating the present phenomenon. Atr also potentiated GH release stimulated by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and PRL release stimulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide, but had no effect on GRF-stimulated GH release. The choline uptake blocker hemicholinium abolished the effect of Atr on GH and PRL release. These data suggest that certain pituitary cells can express CAT activity and that these cells exert a tonic inhibitory activity on GH and PRL release which is mediated by a cholinomimetic substance, possibly acetylcholine, through a muscarinic receptor. status: publishe...|$|E
