500|$|The song {{appeared}} in two shows of 1918: Yip Yip Yaphank and Ziegfeld Follies of 1918. Yip Yip Yaphank opened on August 19 and Berlin made his entrance {{late in the}} show, being dragged from a pup tent by two other soldiers as he pretended to <b>be</b> <b>asleep</b> on his feet to sing [...] "Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning". The song was a centerpiece of the show; both it and Berlin's performance received favorable reviews. According to reviewers, Berlin's voice was thin but his timing was perfect and he presented a hilarious stage persona. 24 years later, the New York Times declared Yip [...] "an immediate hit." ...|$|E
500|$|Parsons {{agreed to}} move his {{daughter}} to Aldrich's house for further testing on 22January, but when that morning Penn and a man of [...] "veracity and fortune" [...] called on Parsons and asked for Elizabeth, the clerk told them she was not there and refused to reveal her whereabouts. [...] Parsons had spoken with friends and was apparently worried that Kent had been busy with his own investigations. [...] Instead, he allowed Elizabeth to be moved that night to St Bartholomew's Hospital, where another séance was held. [...] Nothing was reported until about 6am, when three scratches were heard, apparently while the girl was asleep. [...] The approximately 20-strong audience complained that the affair was a deception. [...] Once Elizabeth woke she began to cry, and once reassured that she was safe admitted that she was afraid for her father, [...] "who must needs be ruined and undone, if their matter should be {{supposed to be an}} imposture." [...] She also admitted that although she had appeared to <b>be</b> <b>asleep,</b> she was in fact fully aware of the conversation going on around her.|$|E
500|$|One day, the {{adolescent}} Tubman {{was sent to}} a dry-goods store for supplies. There, she encountered a slave owned by another family, who had left the fields without permission. His overseer, furious, demanded that she help restrain him. She refused, and as he ran away, the overseer threw a two-pound weight at him. He struck her instead, which she said [...] "broke my skull." [...] She later explained her belief that her hair – which [...] "had never been combed and...stood out like a bushel basket" [...] – might have saved her life. Bleeding and unconscious, she was returned to her owner's house and laid on the seat of a loom, where she remained without medical care for two days. She was sent back into the fields, [...] "with blood and sweat rolling down my face until I couldn't see." [...] Her boss said she was [...] "not worth a sixpence" [...] and returned her to Brodess, who tried unsuccessfully to sell her. She began having seizures and would seemingly fall unconscious, although she claimed to be aware of her surroundings while appearing to <b>be</b> <b>asleep.</b> These episodes were alarming to her family, who were unable to wake her when she fell asleep suddenly and without warning. This condition remained with her {{for the rest of her}} life; Larson suggests she may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy as a result of the injury.|$|E

500|$|The Imperial {{court in}} Vienna criticized Daun for {{his failure to}} act; the Empress and her ministers worried that the Russians and the French would {{drop out of the}} {{coalition}} if there were no action. [...] Daun, a cautious and diligent commander, took his time to make his plans. The Strohmberg, one of the heights abutting Hochkirch, anchored Daun's left flank, and he deployed the remainder of his force southward across the road between Bautzen and Loebau. This also gave him control of an important junction between Görlitz in the east and Zittau in the south. He anchored the far right end of his line in another wooded hill south of the road, called the Kuppritzerberg. The Prussians neither increased their security nor deployed their troops in response to the Austrian presence. Daun also took into account that his men were eager to fight a battle and that they outnumbered the Prussians by more than two-to-one. His men made a great production of hewing the trees in a nearby forest, action which Frederick interpreted as efforts to create field works, not, as it was actually intended, to build a road through the thick wood. Daun also had discovered a secret weakness of Frederick's. His own personal secretary had been sending Frederick information on Daun's plans, secreted in deliveries of eggs; upon discovering this, Daun promised the man his life in return for his cooperation in continuing to send Frederick misinformation. Daun's plan, which he had kept secret, was an early morning sweep through the woods with 30,000 specially picked troops, around Frederick's flank, to enclose him. The Prussian army would <b>be</b> <b>asleep,</b> both literally and figuratively, when the Austrian army struck.|$|E
2500|$|The plot of {{the film}} is largely {{unchanged}} from that of Shakespeare's original play. Differences include the modern-day setting, switching Conrade's gender, eliminating several minor roles and consolidating others into Leonato's aide, and expanding Ursula's role by giving her a number of Margaret's scenes. [...] In addition, the film attempts to add background to the relationship between Beatrice and Benedick by showing, in an opening scene, a morning after they apparently slept together. Benedick steals away quietly while Beatrice pretends to <b>be</b> <b>asleep.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On 30 January 2011, the BBC {{broadcast}} {{an episode}} of its motoring TV show Top Gear during which presenters referred to Mexicans as both [...] "lazy" [...] and [...] "feckless" [...] and Mexican food as [...] "refried sick". The broadcast caused many complaints in Mexico, including in newspapers and websites, while a motion of censure was considered in the Mexican senate and the BBC Spanish-language website BBC Mundo received protests. Richard Hammond, one of the presenters, expressed doubt {{that there would be}} any complaints against them as, he alleged, the Mexican ambassador would <b>be</b> <b>asleep.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Awareness {{occurs when}} {{patients}} have anesthesia that is inadequate {{to keep them}} unconscious during an operation. [...] The incidence of this anesthesia complication is variable and seems to affect 0.2% to 0.4% of patients according to the surgical setting carried out. This variation reflects the surgical setting {{as well as the}} physiological state of the patient. Thus, the incidence is 0.2% in general surgery, about 0.4% during caesarean section, between 1 and 2% during cardiac surgery and between 10% and 40% for anesthesia of the traumatized. The majority of these do not feel pain although around one third did, in a range of experience from a sore throat due to the endotracheal tube, to traumatic pain at the incision site. The incidence is halved in the absence of neuro-muscular blockade. In this situation, the patient may feel the pain or pressure of surgery, hear conversation, experience air hunger, or have difficulty breathing. The patient may be unable to communicate any distress because they have been given a muscle relaxant; without this, they can move and the anesthesiologists are alerted and provide more anesthetic drugs to render the patient unconscious again. If anesthesia awareness does occur, about 42% feel the pain of the operation, 94% experience panic or anxiety, and 70% experience lasting symptoms which may be psychological and may be physical or neurological. The quoted incidences are controversial as many cases of [...] "awareness" [...] are open to interpretation. These usually involve feeling severe pain, clear recall of the conversations of the operating room staff or suffocation. Some patients undergo sedation for smaller procedures such as biopsies and colonoscopies and are told they will <b>be</b> <b>asleep,</b> although in fact they are getting a sedation that may allow some level of awareness as opposed to a general anesthetic.|$|E
