5|$|The cadet pledge was {{considered}} a statement of intention rather than a binding contract. The attrition rate for cadets was comparable to that reported for other schools of nursing in the same period. The main cause of withdrawals was homesickness; some married students withdrew to <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> husbands when they were released from the military; others when the hostilities ceased; some failed in their studies; others left for health reasons; and some left because of the realities of a nursing career.|$|E
5|$|After the {{televised}} draft, Joey Styles, the Director of Digital Media Content for WWE's official website, interviewed the draftees on their reactions. The drafted wrestlers generally expressed {{approval of the}} draft and described what they hoped their experiences would <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> new brand. Seven of the wrestlers were champions with their original brand, and as outlined in the draft regulations, they carried their titles over to their new brand; this affected seven of nine championships. Champion draft selections included: Unified Tag Team Champions The Colóns (Carlito and Primo), United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter, WWE Champion Triple H, and Divas Champion Maryse from SmackDown to Raw; Women's Champion Melina and Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio from Raw to SmackDown. Since Triple H was drafted to Raw, it left SmackDown without a top contested title, as Raw now featured {{two of the three}} top contested championships in WWE: the WWE and World Heavyweight Championships (although Edge would later brought the World Heavyweight Championship title back to SmackDown as its exclusive-top title following his win against John Cena at Backlash). When Mysterio and Porter switched brands, the two secondary championships switched brands {{for the first time in}} WWE's history. This also occurred when Melina and Maryse switched brands, as the two female contested titles also switched brands for the first time. Though the Unified Tag Team Champions were both drafted over to Raw from SmackDown, the titles were able to be defended on all three brands due to being unified.|$|E
50|$|Many {{researchers}} found assimilation effects when deliberately manipulating {{the order of}} general and specific questions. When they first asked participants how happy they <b>were</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> dating or how satisfied they <b>were</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> relationship (a specific question that functions as a moderate context stimulus) and subsequently asked the participants how happy they <b>were</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> life in general (general question), they found assimilation effects. The specific question of <b>their</b> happiness <b>with</b> dating or satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>their</b> relationship made specific information accessible, that was further included as representation of the subsequent general question as target stimulus. Thus, {{by the time the}} participants <b>were</b> happy <b>with</b> <b>their</b> dating or satisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> relationship, they also reported being happier <b>with</b> <b>their</b> life in general. Similarly, when the participants <b>were</b> unhappy <b>with</b> <b>their</b> dating or dissatisfied <b>with</b> <b>their</b> relationships, they indicated being also unhappier <b>with</b> <b>their</b> life in general. This effect did not occur, when asking the general question in the first place.|$|R

25|$|PETA is {{critical}} of television personalities they call self-professed wildlife warriors, arguing that while a conservationist message is getting across, some of the actions are harmful to animals, such as invading animals' homes, netting them, subjecting them to stressful environments, and wrestling with them—often involving young animals the group says should <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> mothers. In 2006 when Steve Irwin died, PETA's vice-president Dan Mathews said Irwin had {{made a career out}} of antagonizing frightened wild animals.

25|$|In early 1963, Jacqueline {{was again}} pregnant, leading her to curtail her {{official}} duties. She {{spent most of}} the summer at a home {{she and her husband had}} rented on Squaw Island, near the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. On August 7, five weeks ahead of her scheduled Caesarean section, she went into labor and gave birth to a boy, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, via emergency Caesarean section at nearby Otis Air Force Base. His lungs were not fully developed, and he was transferred from Cape Cod to Boston Children's Hospital where he died of hyaline membrane disease two days after birth. Jacqueline had remained at Otis Air Force Base to recuperate after the Caesarean delivery; her husband went to Boston to <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> infant son, and was present at his death. He returned to Otis on August 14 to take her home, giving an impromptu speech to thank nurses and airmen that had gathered in her suite, and she presented hospital staff with framed and signed lithographs of the White House.|$|E
25|$|The Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907 {{stopped the}} {{issuance}} of passports to Japanese laborers trying to go to America or Hawaii. However, there was a loophole in the agreement that allowed wives and children to immigrate to <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> husbands and fathers. It was because of this loophole that so many picture brides were able to immigrate to Hawaii and the United States. The impact of the Gentlemen's Agreement {{is evident in the}} population percentage of men and women before and after it was issued. For example, 86.7 percent of Japanese admitted to U.S. prior to Gentlemen's Agreement were men, after the agreement only 41.6 percent of the Japanese admitted were men. The spread of the Japanese people grew so rapidly that, in 1897, the Japanese were known as the largest single ethnic group in Hawai'i, consisting of 40 percent of the population by the year 1900. Between 1907 and 1923 14,276 Japanese picture brides and 951 Korean picture brides arrived in Hawaii. Between 1908 and 1920 over 10,000 picture brides arrived on the West Coast of the United States.|$|E

25|$|Tina Brown {{was born}} in Maidenhead, England, {{and she and her}} elder brother, Christopher Hambley Brown (who became a movie producer) grew up in Little Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, a Thames village in the {{countryside}} west of London. Her father, George Hambley Brown, was active in the British film industry producing the early Miss Marple films in the series starring Margaret Rutherford, based on the character created by Agatha Christie. His other films included The Chiltern Hundreds (1949); Hotel Sahara (1951), starring Yvonne De Carlo; Guns at Batasi (1964), starring Richard Attenborough and Mia Farrow. In 1939, he had an early marriage to the actress Maureen O'Hara; according to O'Hara, it was never consummated, owing to her parents' intervention, and it was annulled. George later met and married Brown's mother, Bettina Iris Mary (Kohr), who was an assistant to Laurence Olivier. Brown's mother was of part Iraqi descent; she recounted, “She was dark and I never knew why.” In her later years, Bettina wrote for an English-language magazine for expatriates in Spain where she and her husband lived in retirement until moving to New York in the early eighties to <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> daughter and grandchildren.|$|E
