25|$|There is {{evidence}} {{that there have been}} significant changes in Amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and subsequent deglaciation. Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin. There is debate, however, over how extensive this reduction was. Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today.

40|$|Cognitive bias {{modification}} for attentional bias (CBM-A) {{attempts to}} alleviate anxiety by training an attentional <b>bias</b> <b>away</b> from threat. Several authors {{have argued that}} CBM-A in fact trains top-down, reactive counteraction of the tendency to orient towards threat. Imposing a working memory (WM) load during training should therefore limit its efficacy, since WM resources are required for goal-driven control of attention. Twenty-eight subclinical high-anxious participants completed two sessions of CBM-A or placebo training: one under a high WM load, and one under a low WM load. Attentional bias was assessed after each training. CBM-A produced an attentional <b>bias</b> <b>away</b> from threat under low load, but not under high load. These results suggest CBM-A trains top-down counteraction of orienting to threat. It also suggests the administration of CBM-A in the home environment may be affected by everyday worries and distractions. Publisher's Versio...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether children's spatial recall performance shows three separable characteristics: (1) <b>biases</b> <b>away</b> from symmetry axes (geometric effects); (2) systematic drift over delays; and (3) biases toward the exemplar distribution {{experienced in the}} task (experience-dependent effects). In Experiment 1, the location of one target within each geometric category was varied. Children's responses showed <b>biases</b> <b>away</b> from a midline axis that increased over delays. In Experiment 2, multiple targets were placed within each category at the same locations used in Experiment 1. After removing geometric effects, 6 -year-olds'-but not 11 -year-olds'-responses were biased toward the average remembered location over learning. In Experiment 3, children responded to one target more frequently than the others. Both 6 - and 11 -year-olds showed biases toward the most frequent target over learning.

40|$|Women {{appear to}} exhibit a subtle {{reluctance}} {{to engage in}} long-term relationships with physically attractive, high-status men.

Therefore, interpersonal trust and perceived market value should moderate the extent of this counterintuitive bias. To test this proposal, we asked women with varying levels of interpersonal trust and self-perceived desirability to consider physically-attractive and physically-average men of high, medium and low socioeconomic status and rate each in terms of attractiveness as a long-term partner. Results showed that women’s perceptions of their own desirability and their level of trust predicted their ratings of men with high-value in the mating market, and that women with high levels of both desirability and trust were less likely to show a <b>bias</b> <b>away</b> from high-value men.

Following the presentation of each face pair, subjects pressed a button to a probe that was either on the same (congruent) or opposite (incongruent) side as the angry face.

40|$|Background : Exposure {{to chronic}} {{interpersonal}} violence (IPV) {{has been associated}} with psychiatric impairment; however, few studies have investigated attention processes and psychophysiology in this population. Objective : We investigated self-report and physiological correlates of attention biases in 27 IPV-exposed women. Method : Participants completed self-report measures of trauma history, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and dissociation; were monitored physiologically during baseline; and responded to an emotional dot probe task. Results : Participants showed <b>bias</b> <b>away</b> from positive and anxiety words, and toward IPV words. Lower baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and higher skin conductance levels were associated with <b>bias</b> <b>away</b> from anxiety cues. Greater total PTSD symptoms were associated with bias toward IPV cues, and greater PTSD intrusion and avoidance symptoms were associated with lower RSA. Individuals exposed to more types of trauma had lower heart rates.

The shift in the liquid flux distribution was much greater than that caused by the angling of the LOX post alone. Gas velocity near the wall simultaneously increased with increasing LOX post <b>bias</b> <b>away</b> from the wall.

Using event-related {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and a behavioral measure of attention to angry faces, the authors evaluated differences in response between healthy adolescents and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder. METHOD: In the primary trials of interest, 18 adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder and 15 comparison subjects of equivalent age/gender/IQ viewed angry/neutral face pairs during fMRI acquisition. Following the presentation of each face pair, subjects pressed a button to indicate whether a subsequent asterisk appeared on the same (congruent) or opposite (incongruent) side as the angry face. Reaction time differences between congruent and incongruent face trials provided a measure of attention bias to angry faces. RESULTS: Relative to the comparison subjects, patients with generalized anxiety disorder manifested greater right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activation to trials containing angry faces. Patients with generalized anxiety disorder also showed greater attention <b>bias</b> <b>away</b> from angry faces. Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activation differences remained evident when differences in attention bias were covaried. Finally, in an examination among patients of the association between degree of anxiety and brain activation, the authors found that as ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activation increased, severity of anxiety symptoms diminished. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder show greater right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activation and attentional <b>bias</b> <b>away</b> from angry faces than healthy adolescents.

40|$|Both the {{anterior}} cingulate cortex (ACC) and mesolimbic dopamine, particularly in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), have been implicated in allowing an animal to overcome effort constraints to obtain greater benefits. However, their exact contribution to such decisions has, to date, never been directly compared. To investigate this issue we tested rats on an operant effort-related cost-benefit decision-making task where animals selected between two response alternatives, one of which involved investing effort by lever pressing on a high fixed-ratio (FR) schedule to gain high reward [four food pellets (HR) ], whereas the other led to {{a small amount of}} food on an FR schedule entailing less energetic cost [two food pellets, low reward (LR) ]. All animals initially preferred to put in work to gain the HR. Systemic administration of a D 2 antagonist caused a significant switch in choices towards the LR option. Similarly, post-operatively, excitotoxic ACC lesions caused a significant <b>bias</b> <b>away</b> from HR choices compared with sham-lesioned animals. There was no slowing in the speed of lever pressing and no correlation between time to complete the FR requirement and choice performance. Unexpectedly, no such alteration in choice allocation was observed in animals following 6 -hydroxydopamine NAc lesions. However, these rats were consistently slower to initiate responding when cued to commence each trial and also showed a reduction in food hoarding on a species-typical foraging task. Taken together, this implies that only ACC lesions, and not 6 -hydroxydopamine NAc lesions as performed here, cause a <b>bias</b> <b>away</b> from investing effort for greater reward when choosing between competing option...|$|R

40|$|Perception and {{cognition}} {{are inextricably}} intertwined. This interaction {{is evident in}} the development of spatial memory. Early in development there is a transition in memory biases. Young children’s spatial working memory (SWM) responses are biased toward the center of a homogenous space, whereas older children and adults subdivide the space along the midline symmetry axis, and their memory responses are <b>biased</b> <b>away</b> {{from the center of the}} space. According to Dynamic Field Theory (DFT), a dynamic systems model of spatial cognition, developmental changes in geometric biases in SWM are caused by changes in neural interaction in SWM and the development of children’s perceptual abilities. Specifically, over development of children’s ability to perceive the location of axes of symmetry improves quantitatively. Ortmann and Schutte (2010) examined whether there were changes in children’s ability to perceive the location of symmetry axes by having 3 ‐ to 6 ‐year‐olds and adults determine on which half of a large monitor a smiley face was located. Three‐ to 6 ‐year‐olds were above chance at classifying all but the location closest to midline, and over development there was improvement in the ability to localize the axis. Despite this apparent ability to perceive the symmetry axes, 3 ‐year‐olds do not reliably subdivide space in SWM tasks (Huttenlocher et al., 1994; Schutte et al., 2009). Perhaps their perception of midline is too “fuzzy” for them to use it as a reference axis in memory. Two studies support this proposal. First, when given perceptual support (i. e., cues on midline), 3 ‐year‐olds subdivide the space. Second, 3 ‐year‐olds’ perception of the midline symmetry axis is related to their memory biases. Specifically, children who are better able to determine on which side of midline a target is located are more likely to be <b>biased</b> <b>away</b> from midline in the spatial memory task for all targets except the two closest to midline. These results support Dynamic Field Theory and demonstrate interactions between perception and cognition over development...|$|E
