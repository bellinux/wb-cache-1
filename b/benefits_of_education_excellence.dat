40|$|The private market <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>education,</b> i. e. {{the wage}} premia of graduates, are widely {{studied at the}} micro level, {{although}} the magnitude of their macroeconomic impact is disputed. However, there are additional <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>education,</b> which are less well understood but could potentially drive significant macroeconomic impacts. Following the taxonomy of McMahon (2009) we identify four different types <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>education.</b> These are: private market benefits (wage premia); private non market benefits (own health, happiness, etc.); external market benefits (productivity spillovers; and external non-market benefits (crime rates, civic society, democratisation, etc.). Drawing on available microeconometric evidence we use a micro-to-macro simulation approach (Hermannsson et al, 2010) to estimate the macroeconomic impacts <b>of</b> external <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> higher <b>education.</b> We explore four cases: technology spillovers from HEIs; productivity spillovers from more skilled workers in the labour market; reduction in property crime; and the potential overall impact of external and private non-market benefits. Our {{results suggest that the}} external economic <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> higher <b>education</b> could potentially be very large. However, given the dearth of microeconomic evidence this result should be seen as tentative.

Using a dynamic model of educational choice we estimate returns to education {{that account for}} selection bias and sorting on gains. We investigate a range of non-market outcomes including incarceration, mental health, voter participation, trust, and participation in welfare. We find distinct patterns of returns that depend on the levels of schooling and ability. Unlike the monetary <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>education,</b> the <b>benefits</b> to education for many non-market outcomes are greater for low-ability persons.

40|$|Changes in {{the demand}} for higher {{education}} in postwar Japan are analyzed. Three simple conceptual models <b>of</b> the anticipated <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> are considered, along with the validity of each model in explaining changes in aggregate demand for college. A classical model assumes that individuals know about the prevailing wage structure and expect it to stay unchanged. A perception bias (lag) model posits that individuals anticipate the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> according to wage structure perceptions, which are. biased or lagged images of the present and past structure. The shift expectation model integrates the factor of expectation of future shift in wage structure. To test the validity of each model, alternative sets of time-series indices <b>of</b> anticipated <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> higher <b>education</b> were estimated from wage structure statistics.

40|$|The {{decision}} between vocational {{and general}} tracks <b>of</b> <b>education</b> is instrumental {{to the future}} earnings of individuals. While human capital theory suggests that individuals directly calculate the costs and <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> before making such decisions, empirical studies on the link between tracking choices and {{the costs and benefits}} that individuals actually expect {{at the time of the}} decision are rare. This research elicits the subjective expectation of future costs and <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> vocational and general education, as well as measures of social support, cognitive ability, vocational preference, and ability to delay gratification of ninth graders. It investigates the effect of these factors on students' decisions between vocational and general high schools. The survey data was collected from 3, 783 students from 41 schools in Udonthani Province, Thailand, and was analyzed using logistic regression. Forty-one of the sampled students were interviewed in addition to the survey, and their interview results were incorporated in the choice model analysis. The results suggest that the net monetary <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> is not an important vocational and general high school determinant. Rather, expected support from family and friends, cognitive ability, vocational preference, ability to delay gratification, gender, and socioeconomic status are significant factors that affect the students' decisions. The analysis of student interviews also suggests that the reasons that the majority of students do not include the costs and/or <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> in their decision functions, possibly include 1) students are not paying for, or are not concerned about, their educational costs and 2) students feel that the monetary <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> only occur in the distant future and thus feel it does not warrant present attention...|$|R
