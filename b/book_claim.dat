5000|$|Five Anti-Catholic Myths - Slavery, Crusades, Inquisition, Galileo, Holocaust. The myths {{analyzed}} in this <b>book</b> <b>claim</b> to lay bare the [...] "dirty history" [...] of the Catholic Church. Well, the Catholic Church’s [...] "dirty history" [...] {{is not that}} dirty at all. As Pope Leo XIII once said, the Catholic Church {{has no reason to}} fear historical truth. Yet, some Catholics as well as many non-Catholics often see history through a lens that has been shaped by post-Reformation propaganda or by 18th century Enlightenment prejudices. These myths served a purpose then, but they still serve a purpose in today’s secularist climate of progress and scientism. But does that really validate them? Scholarship of recent decades, however, has thrown new light on these matters, and is finally allowing the truths of history to become more widely known.|$|E
5000|$|Amicalola Falls—at 729 ft Amicalola Falls is {{the highest}} {{waterfall}} in Georgia and the third highest east of the Mississippi River. It is approximately four times the height of Niagara's Horseshoe Falls. It is located on Amicalola Creek in Amicalola Falls State Park and is accessible via several trails, bridges, and parking areas. Visitors may park at either the top or {{the base of the}} falls; a well-maintained trail, including over 600 steps, connects those two points. Another trail connects the falls to the terminus of the Appalachian Trail on nearby Springer Mountain. Some sources, including the 2004 Georgia State Parks guide <b>book,</b> <b>claim</b> that Amicaolola Falls are [...] "the tallest east of the Mississippi River," [...] although Crabtree Falls in Virginia (at 1000 feet) and Glassmine Falls in North Carolina (800 feet) are both taller. (The state park website is more specific—and perhaps more accurate—citing Amicalola as [...] "the tallest cascading waterfall". More recent editions of the print version of the guide have corrected the error.) (...) ...|$|E

5000|$|Napoleon Hill {{published}} {{two books}} on the theme. The first was The Law of Success in 16 Lessons (1928), which directly and repeatedly referenced the law of attraction and proposed that it operates by use of radio waves transmitted by the brain. Then in 1937, he published Think and Grow Rich, which {{went on to become}} one of the best selling books of all time, selling over 60 million copies. In this book, Hill insisted on the importance of controlling one's own thoughts in order to achieve success, as well as the energy that thoughts have and their ability to attract other thoughts. In the beginning of the book, Hill mentions a [...] "secret" [...] to success and promises to indirectly describe it at least once in every chapter of the book. It is never named directly, for he says that discovering it on one's own is far more beneficial. Many people have argued over what the secret actually is, some claiming that it is the law of attraction. Hill states the [...] "secret" [...] to which he refers is mentioned no fewer than a hundred times, yet reference to [...] "attract" [...] is used less than 30 times in the text. Most students of the <b>book</b> <b>claim</b> the secret is hidden in its title: THINK (i.e., thinking the right thoughts).|$|E
40|$|Early {{in their}} {{introductory}} comments, {{the editors of}} this <b>book</b> <b>claim</b> that they “are not political activists and that [they] neither promote nor defend industrial agriculture based on any political agenda” (p. 4). Industrial agriculture, as understood in this book, includes large corporations, vertically integrated firms, multinationals, {{and anything else that}} seems to differ from what might {{be thought of as a}} traditional family farm. The editors suggest that their goal is to provide objective assessments of one example of industrial agriculture, large-scale hog confinement operations. However, as the introduction progresses, strange things seem to happen to this perfectly sensible goal. On page 13, several studies highlighting the potential benefits of large-scale swine production enterprises are dismissed because they are “based on a set of assumptions, not empirical data. ” But on the next page, a study by one of the contributors to the volume (an agricultural economist) is cited approvingly with no critical discussion of the fact that the chapter in question is also based on assumptions and, what is worse, includes straw-man argumentation and conclusions that are not supported by the data reported...|$|E
