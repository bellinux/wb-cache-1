25|$|The warm {{period during}} between 7000–3000 BCE {{is called the}} Holocene climatic optimum. Towards {{the end of the}} Archaic period, {{seasonal}} weather was a time of Meridional overturning circulation and large storms came up from the Gulf of Mexico. The western and northern valleys of West Virginia became warm and dry with less precipitation around 2550 BCE, causing the <b>bottom</b> <b>land</b> flora to thin out and creating occasional major floods and serious erosion during {{the early part of this}} transitional weather pattern.|$|E

25|$|The first European {{settlers}} {{were mostly}} ethnic French Canadians, who created their first settlement in Missouri at present-day Ste. Genevieve, {{about an hour}} south of St. Louis. They had migrated about 1750 from the Illinois Country. They came from colonial villages {{on the east side}} of the Mississippi River, where soils were becoming exhausted and there was insufficient river <b>bottom</b> <b>land</b> for the growing population. Sainte-Geneviève became a thriving agricultural center, producing enough surplus wheat, corn and tobacco to ship tons of grain annually downriver to Lower Louisiana for trade. Grain production in the Illinois Country was critical to the survival of Lower Louisiana and especially the city of New Orleans.|$|E
25|$|During the Pike's Peak Gold Rush in 1858, Ralston brought {{another group}} of prospectors back {{to the site of}} his first discovery. The placer gold in the area soon played out, but hard rock {{deposits}} of gold were found in the mountains to the west. Some of the miners abandoned their search for gold and returned to farm the rich <b>bottom</b> <b>land</b> along Ralston Creek and Clear Creek. They found an eager market for their crops among other gold seekers. The Territory of Colorado was formed on February 28, 1861, and the farms in the valley expanded to feed the growing population of the region.|$|E
25|$|Hunting parties {{left their}} towns after the growing season, moving up {{tributary}} streams to temporary camps {{through the winter}} in the state. Local legends suggest the hunt had a religious aspect.). The Riparian zone on the lower western drainage of the Allegheny Mountains has some creek bottoms which were covered over with shallow beaver lakes. At the base of these hills is the mantel created by watering animals {{at the edge of}} the beaver lake. The narrower bottom creeks become brooks flowing around cliff ridge-lines and rolling hills on enveloped terraces feeding the bottomland of major rivers. Along the <b>bottom</b> <b>land</b> and terrace of slower moving waters, the Late Prehistoric farming Indian had lived and canoed. Occasionally, an earlier hunter's point from antiquity can be found around these mantels, which are distant from today's dryer creek beds across plowable bottoms. With the exception of elk and mountain lion, absent today, these bowmen hunted today's game.|$|E

500|$|Grand Coulee Dam flooded over 21,000 acres (85km2) {{of prime}} <b>bottom</b> <b>land</b> where Native Americans {{had been living}} and hunting for {{thousands}} of years, forcing the relocation of settlements and graveyards. The Office of Indian Affairs negotiated with the United States Bureau of Reclamation on behalf of tribes who {{were concerned about the}} flooding of their grave sites. The Acquisition of Indian Lands for Grand Coulee Dam, 54 Stat.703 Act of June 20, 1940 allowed the Secretary of the Interior to remove human remains to new Native American grave sites. The burial relocation project started in September 1939. Human remains were put into small containers and many artifacts were discovered, but the methods of collection destroyed archaeological evidence. Various estimates for the number of relocated graves in 1939 [...] include 915 graves reported by the Bureau of Reclamation Reclamation, or 1,388 reported by Howard T. Ball, who supervised the field work. Tribal leaders reported another 2,000 graves in 1940, but the Bureau of Reclamation would not continue grave relocation, and the sites were soon covered by water.|$|E

The nearby Dempsey Mound in Fayette County, along Laurel Creek, was also reduced before modern science arrived. Beards Fork Petroglyphs are a few miles away. The site at Alloy in Fayette County, 46FA189, is a Woodland occupation site.|$|E
60|$|Hawkeye had, in truth, {{in these}} few words, given no bad {{description}} of the prospect that now lay in their front. The brook was irregular in its width, sometimes shooting through narrow fissures in the rocks, and at others spreading over acres of <b>bottom</b> <b>land,</b> forming little areas that might be termed ponds. Everywhere along its banks were the mouldering relics of dead trees, in all the stages of decay, from those that groaned on their tottering trunks to such as had recently been robbed of those rugged coats that so mysteriously contain their principle of life. A few long, low, and moss-covered piles were scattered among them, like the memorials of a former and long-departed generation.|$|E

60|$|After making {{nearly a}} {{semicircle}} around the pond, they diverged from the water-course, {{and began to}} ascend {{to the level of}} a slight elevation in that <b>bottom</b> <b>land,</b> over which they journeyed. Within half an hour they gained the margin of another opening that bore all the signs of having been also made by the beavers, and which those sagacious animals had probably been induced, by some accident, to abandon, for the more eligible position they now occupied. A very natural sensation caused Duncan to hesitate a moment, unwilling to leave the cover of their bushy path, as a man pauses to collect his energies before he essays any hazardous experiment, in which he is secretly conscious they will all be needed. He profited by the halt, to gather such information as might be obtained from his short and hasty glances.|$|E

Each time that they slackened their pace the sound would become more audible, and was at last accompanied by that slight but unmistakable tremor of the earth that betrayed the vicinity of a waterfall. Hesitating over the phenomenon, which seemed to imply that their topography was wrong and that they had blundered from the track, they were presently startled {{by the fact that the}} sound was actually APPROACHING them! With a sudden instinct they both galloped towards the lagoon. As the timber opened before them Jim uttered a long ecstatic shout. [...] "Why, it's THEM!" ...|$|E
60|$|General Ord {{had joined}} Hurlbut on the 4th and being senior took command of his troops.

The <b>bottom</b> <b>land</b> here was swampy and bad for the operations of troops, making a good place to get an enemy into. Ord attacked the troops that had crossed the bridge and drove them back in a panic. Many were killed, and others were drowned by being pushed off the bridge in their hurried retreat. Ord followed and met the main force. He was too weak in numbers to assault, but he held the bridge and compelled the enemy to resume his retreat by another bridge higher up the stream. Ord was wounded in this engagement and the command devolved on Hurlbut.|$|E

60|$|As {{soon as the}} two men {{had taken}} their stations, and began to look about them, a feeling of awe mingled with their curiosity. Truly, the scene was one so very {{remarkable}} and imposing that it might have filled more intellectual and better fortified minds with some such sensation. The fire was by no means large, nor was it particularly bright; but sufficient to cast a dim light on the objects within reach of its rays. It was in the precise centre of a bit of <b>bottom</b> <b>land</b> of about half an acre in extent, which was so formed and surrounded, as to have something of the appearance of the arena of a large amphitheatre. There was one break in the encircling rise of ground, it is true, and that was at a spot directly opposite the station of le Bourdon and his companion, where the rill which flowed from the spring found a passage out toward the more open ground. Branches shaded most of the mound, but the arena itself was totally free from all vegetation but that which covered the dense and beautiful sward with which it was carpeted. Such is {{a brief description of the}} natural accessories of this remarkable scene.|$|E
6000|$|As this smoking {{was just}} then {{more a matter}} of {{ceremony}} than for any other purpose, a whiff or two suffices for each chief; the smoker passing the pipe to his neighbor as soon as he had inhaled a few puffs. The Indians are models of propriety, in their happiest moods, and every one in that dark and menacing circle was permitted to have his turn with the pipe, before any other step was taken. There were but two pipes lighted, and mouths being numerous, some time was necessary in order to complete this ceremony. Still, no sign of impatience was seen, the lowest chief having as much respect paid to his feelings, as related to his attention, as the highest. At length the pipes completed their circuit, even Parson Amen getting, and using, his turn, when a dead pause succeeded. The silence resembled that of a Quaker meeting, and was broken only by the rising of one of the principal chiefs, evidently about to speak. The language of the great Ojebway nation was used on this occasion, most of the chiefs present belonging to some one of the tribes of that stock, though several spoke other tongues, English and French included. Of the three whites present, Parson Amen alone fully comprehended all that was said, he having qualified himself in this respect, to preach to the tribes of that people; though le Bourdon understood nearly all, and even the corporal comprehended a good deal. The name of the chief who first spoke at this secret meeting, which was afterward known among the Ojebways by the name of the [...] "Council of the <b>Bottom</b> <b>Land,</b> near to the spring of gushing water," [...] was Bear's Meat, an appellation that might denote a distinguished hunter, rather than an orator of much renown.|$|E
5000|$|The Bottom is {{a mostly}} black {{neighborhood}} in Ohio.
