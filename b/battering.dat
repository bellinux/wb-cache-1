5|$|On May 17, 2006, another suspect, Guido Wever (the son of {{a former}} Aruban politician) was {{detained}} in the Netherlands on suspicion of assisting in the abducting, <b>battering,</b> and killing of Holloway. Wever was questioned for six days in Utrecht. Aruban prosecutors initially sought his transfer to the island, but he was instead released by agreement between the prosecutor and Wever's attorney.|$|E
5|$|The French 1st Army {{had also}} taken a <b>battering</b> and despite winning several {{tactical}} defensive victories it {{was forced to}} retreat on 15 May owing to developments elsewhere, leaving its tanks on the battlefield, while the Germans were free to recover theirs.|$|E
5|$|As Julia never posed any {{significant}} threat to land, damage {{related to the}} storm was minimal. Trace amounts of rain reportedly fell across the Cape Verde islands, causing locally light flooding and minor inconveniences. Gusts <b>battering</b> the territory peaked at 30mph (48km/h), resulting in some wind damage to crops. In addition, these winds produced rough sea conditions, and high waves posed few threats along coastlines.|$|E
50|$|At any time, {{the proper}} <b>batter</b> {{is simply the}} player whose name follows the {{previous}} actual <b>batter</b> in the written batting order (at {{the start of the}} game, the #1 hitter is the proper <b>batter,</b> and in subsequent innings, the leadoff proper <b>batter</b> is the one who follows the last <b>batter</b> to complete a plate appearance in the last previous inning). Any <b>batter's</b> out-of-turn but completed plate appearance is legalized when a pitch is thrown to any subsequent <b>batter</b> on either team. Thus, in order to determine who is the proper <b>batter</b> at any given time, it is necessary only to consider the last two <b>batters</b> who have received a pitch—the last proper or legalized <b>batter</b> and the <b>batter</b> whose action will be nullified if found improper.|$|R
50|$|There are two <b>batter's</b> boxes, one on {{each side}} of home plate. The <b>batter's</b> boxes are 4 feet wide (1.2 m) and 6 feet long (1.8 m). The <b>batter's</b> boxes are {{centered}} lengthwise at the center of home plate with the inside line of each <b>batter's</b> box 6 inches (15.24 cm) from the near edge of home plate. A right-handed <b>batter</b> would stand in the <b>batter's</b> box {{on the left side of}} home plate from the perspective of the catcher and umpire. A left-handed <b>batter</b> would stand in the <b>batter's</b> box to their right. A <b>batter</b> may only occupy one <b>batter's</b> box at a time and may not legally leave the <b>batter's</b> box after the pitcher has come set or has started his windup. Should the <b>batter</b> wish to leave the <b>batter's</b> box once the pitcher has engaged the rubber, he must first ask the umpire for time-out. Time will not be granted if the pitcher has already started his pitching motion. For playing rules relating to the <b>batter's</b> box, see Rules 6.05 and 6.06 of the Official Baseball Rules.|$|R
50|$|If the infraction is {{discovered}} during a plate appearance (that is, a pitch has been {{thrown to the}} current <b>batter),</b> then the umpire considers the current <b>batter</b> and the previous one. If the current <b>batter's</b> name does not follow the previous actual <b>batter's</b> name in the written order, the current <b>batter</b> is improper. There is no penalty, but the situation is rectified — the proper <b>batter</b> comes to bat and assumes the improper <b>batter's</b> current count. In this situation, if the proper <b>batter</b> is on base, then he is simply skipped in the order, and the next <b>batter</b> in the order is now the proper <b>batter.</b> In this situation under high school (NFHS) rules, the proper <b>batter</b> is brought in off the bases, assumes his proper at bat, and a courtesy runner (the last batted out) takes his place on the bases.|$|R
5|$|Book XVIII {{covers the}} terms of war, games and jurisprudence. Isidore {{describes}} standards, trumpets, weapons including swords, spears, arrows, slings, <b>battering</b> rams, and armour including shields, breastplates and helmets. Athletic games include running and jumping, throwing and wrestling. Circus games are described, with chariot racing, horse racing and vaulting. In the theatre, comedy, tragedy, mime and dance are covered. In the amphitheatre, Isidore covers those who fight with nets, nooses and other weapons.|$|E
5|$|Following this {{declaration}} by the Dean, {{demolition of}} {{the remains of the}} old cathedral began in 1668. Demolition of the Old Cathedral proved unexpectedly difficult as the stonework had been bonded together by molten lead. Wren initially used the then-new technique of using gunpowder to bring down the surviving stone walls. Like many experimental techniques, the use of gunpowder was not easy to control; several workers were killed and nearby residents complained about noise and damage. Eventually, Wren resorted to using a <b>battering</b> ram instead. Building work on the new cathedral began in June 1675.|$|E
5|$|In-game {{features}} include large battlefields, {{a large number}} of enemies and officers to defeat, and multiple outcomes for each stage. Certain levels make use of the siege engine (A new feature to the series) and introduce specialized siege equipment such as bridge layers, <b>battering</b> rams and catapults to the stage. Although it is not essential for the completion of stages, having a siege weapon will increase morale for the player's forces, and help the player succeed.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the fourth}} ball, {{it is called}} a walk, and the <b>batter</b> becomes a runner, and is {{entitled}} to advance to first base without risk of being put out, called a base on balls or a walk (abbreviated BB). If a pitch touches the <b>batter</b> (or the <b>batter's</b> clothes), the umpire declares a hit by pitch (abbreviated HBP) and the <b>batter</b> is awarded first base, unless the umpire determines that the ball was in the strike zone when it hit the <b>batter,</b> or that the <b>batter</b> {{did not attempt to}} avoid being hit. In practice, neither exception is ever called unless the <b>batter</b> obviously tries to get hit by the pitch; even standing still in the box will virtually always be overlooked, and the <b>batter</b> awarded first. In addition, if the <b>batter</b> swings at a pitch that hits him, it counts as a strike. If the catcher's mitt, catcher's mask, or any part of the catcher comes in contact with the <b>batter</b> and/or the <b>batter's</b> bat as the <b>batter</b> is attempting to hit a pitch, the <b>batter</b> is awarded first base, ruled [...] "catcher's interference".|$|R
50|$|A <b>batter</b> is out if a fielder {{catches the}} ball {{after it has}} been hit and before it touches the ground, a fielder touches the post of the base halfway up (or higher) with the ball while the <b>batter</b> is running to it, the <b>batter</b> {{deliberately}} drops or throws the bat, or another <b>batter</b> runs to the same base or overtakes a <b>batter,</b> in which case both <b>batters</b> are out.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} located the embassy {{caretaker}} {{and took him}} to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy's front door was reinforced by a steel security door, and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass—the result of recommendations made after the SAS had been asked to review security arrangements for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by <b>battering</b> the front door and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after midnight}} on 21 August, Nhu's men {{attacked}} the pagodas using automatic firearms, grenades, <b>battering</b> rams and explosives, causing widespread damage. Some religious objects were destroyed, including {{a statue of}} Gautama Buddha in the Từ Đàm Pagoda in Huế, which was partially leveled by explosives. Temples were looted and vandalized, with the remains of venerated monks confiscated. In Huế, violent street battles erupted between government forces and rioting pro-Buddhist, anti-government civilians.|$|E
5|$|The Austrian and French armies {{met again}} at Schliengen on 24 October. Moreau had arrayed his force in a semi-circle on the heights, {{offering}} him a tactically superior position. Charles threw his army against both flanks; the French left flank fought stubbornly, but gave way {{under the pressure}} of Condé's emigre corps; the right flank withstood a day-long <b>battering</b> by Latour and Nauendorf, but eventually had to withdraw. The loss of access to the crossing at Kehl forced Moreau to withdraw south to Hüningen.|$|E

5|$|Xangsane made {{landfall}} in the Philippines, <b>battering</b> {{the northern}} islands with torrential rains and strong winds, and causing widespread flooding and landslides. After passing over Manila and emerging over the South China Sea, the typhoon made a second landfall in central Vietnam, also causing flooding and landslides {{there and in}} Thailand. The storm was responsible for at least 279 deaths, mostly in the Philippines and Vietnam, and at least US$747 million in damage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Battering</b> Aitutaki {{with wind}} gusts {{in excess of}} 185km/h (115mph), Cyclone Pat devastated the island. Approximately 78percent of homes were damaged, with 72structures destroyed. The {{electrical}} grid was left completely offline and supply of water was largely lost. Agriculture also experienced tremendous impact, with most crops completely lost. Damage on Aitutaki amounted to US$13.7million; however, casualties were minimal with only eight minor injuries reported. Recovery efforts began immediately after the storm, with the Red Cross and the Government of New Zealand aiding the local government. A reconstruction plan was enacted by the Cook Islands within a month and subsequently funded by New Zealand. Owing to its destructive effects, the name Pat was later retired and replaced with Pili.|$|E
5|$|Because Stanford {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech received it to begin the second half. After starting from their 21-yard line, the Hokies went three-and-out. Following a Tech punt, Stanford's first drive {{of the second half}} began at its 41-yard line. Two plays gained 13yards and a first down, then Stanford began <b>battering</b> Virginia Tech with its passing offense. Luck threw four consecutive passes: the first was incomplete, but the next three went for 10, 17, and 18yards, respectively. This gave Stanford a first down at the Tech one-yard line. Three plays later, Owen Marecic crossed the goal line on a running play. The subsequent extra point was missed, and Stanford extended its lead to 19–12 with 8:47 remaining.|$|E
50|$|When an {{improper}} <b>batter</b> is legalized by a pitch to a subsequent <b>batter,</b> the written order does not change. The proper <b>batter</b> is {{then the next}} <b>batter</b> in the written order just after the newly legalized improper <b>batter,</b> even if this causes one or more <b>batters</b> to be skipped. (If the proper <b>batter</b> is on base—a situation that can happen due to his being a previous improper <b>batter,</b> now legalized—he is skipped and the batting order goes to the next name on it.) Because the umpire and official scorer are not {{to comment on the}} batting order (outside of ruling on an appeal), the teams need to be vigilant about following the written order.|$|R
5000|$|In baseball, a {{right-handed}} pitcher's curve {{ball will}} {{break away from}} a right-handed <b>batter</b> and towards a left-handed <b>batter.</b> Historical batting averages show that left-handed <b>batters</b> have a slight advantage over right-handed <b>batters</b> when facing right-handed pitchers. Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed <b>batters</b> have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed <b>batters.</b> Left-handed <b>batters</b> have a slightly shorter run from the <b>batter's</b> box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls.|$|R
40|$|This {{pilot study}} {{integrated}} sport expertise and biomechanics methodologies within a baseball batting task. Purpose {{was to examine}} differences within a highly skilled group of baseball <b>batters</b> to use visual information to guide weight transfer and bat movements. One <b>batter</b> who played at Major League Baseball (MLB) level was compared to five <b>batters</b> who played at Australian Baseball League (ABL) level in a case-control design. <b>Batters</b> faced pitchers in a simulated competition and attempted to hit pitches, while vision was temporally occluded during ball flight or not occluded. Time of weight transfer (kinetics), as well as bat downswing initiation and duration (kinematics) {{from the point of}} ball release, were compared between the MLB <b>batter</b> and ABL <b>batters.</b> Results indicated that the MLB <b>batter</b> coordinated his striking pattern by completing his weight transfer earlier than the ABL <b>batters.</b> His bat downswing was also initiated earlier than some ABL <b>batters,</b> but {{there was no difference in}} duration of bat downswing between <b>batters.</b> All <b>batters</b> initiated bat downswing prior to completion of weight transfer. Understanding of motor expertise is furthered using a novel methodology...|$|R
5|$|During {{the siege}} of Echinus by Philip V of Macedon in 211BC, the besiegers built {{underground}} tunnels to protect the soldiers and sappers as they {{went back and forth}} from the camp to the siege works. These included two siege towers connected by a makeshift wickerwork curtain wall mounted with stone-shooting ballistae, and sheds to protect the approach of the <b>battering</b> ram. Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in siege technology, Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt became the center for technological improvements to the catapult by the 3rdcenturyBC, as evidenced by the writings of Philo of Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|Major Hans-Günther von Kornatzki {{had formed}} an {{experimental}} unit to evaluate {{new methods of}} bomber attack. Sturmstaffel 1 consisted entirely of volunteers trained to engage the enemy bombers in extremely close quarters, utilising specially armed and up-armored Fw 190's (so-called Sturmböcke) or <b>Battering</b> Rams). These were intended to attack the bombers from the rear in tight arrowhead formations, closing to extreme close range, as replacements for the formerly-dedicated Zerstörer twin-engined heavy fighters, which themselves were being shot down in ever-increasing numbers by Allied escort fighters. In January 1944, the 18 Staffel unit was transferred to Dortmund where they were subordinated to Major Rudolf-Emil Schnoor and his I./JG 1.|$|E
5|$|The 1850 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the most}} recent season excluded from {{the scope of the}} official Atlantic hurricane database. Although meteorological records are sparse and generally incomplete, they indicate that three significant tropical cyclones affected land, each causing some degree of damage. The first system struck North Carolina on July 18, causing significant damage before <b>battering</b> the Mid-Atlantic states with high tides, strong winds, and heavy rainfall. Torrential rainfall caused river flooding from Baltimore to Philadelphia, particularly along the Schuylkill River, which took the lives of 20 people in various incidents. Strong winds damaged property and public facilities in and around New York City, and damaging floods extended into central and northern New England. Crops and railroad infrastructure suffered throughout the entire region.|$|E

5|$|The Athenians seem to {{have offered}} Philip Pydna in {{exchange}} for Amphipolis, perhaps during the later stages of the siege, {{but it is not}} clear whether Philip agreed to this. By this stage, the Social War of 357–355 BC had broken out between Athens and their erstwhile allies, and they would now have been unable to intervene to help Amphipolis. Philip eventually succeeded in breaching the walls of Amphipolis, through the use of siege engines and <b>battering</b> rams; his forces then stormed and captured the city. Philip expelled those who were hostile to him but, according to Diodorus, treated the rest of the population considerately.|$|E
5|$|The first dish {{known to}} have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning). Meanwhile, a number of West African peoples had traditions of {{seasoned}} fried chicken (though <b>battering</b> and cooking the chicken in palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South. Prior to the Second World War, fried chicken was often very expensive and was only enjoyed on special occasions. In the late 1900s and early 2000s, however, fried chicken has been mass-produced and the price of the dish has gone down significantly.|$|E
