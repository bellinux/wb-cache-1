40|$|Radiation {{can be used}} {{to target}} {{specific}} parts of the body to treat cancer. Different forms of shielding material help to ensure that the radiation only reaches the targeted areas and does not damage healthy cells. Therefore, it is important to study how different materials interact with radiation. There will be two methods of interaction that will be discussed. The first method of interaction is the attenuation of a radiation beam. When radiation passes through a material, the intensity of the beam decreases with thickness of the material. How quickly it decreases depends on the material and the energy of the beam. The attenuation of a beam of radiation is an exponentially decreasing function of thickness. The quantity that determines how fast radiation decreases in a medium {{is referred to as the}} attenuation coefficient. Measuring the attenuation coefficient allows one to determine how much radiation has passed through a material of given thickness. The second method of interaction is referred to as buildup. The buildup of radiation is an increase in dosage of a radioactive sample due to Compton Scattering. Buildup is determined by the material the radiation beam is passing through and energy of the radiation beam, just as the attenuation was. The quantity that determines how much the radiation beam’s dosage has increased is referred to as the <b>buildup</b> <b>factor.</b> The <b>buildup</b> <b>factor</b> is multiplied by the exponentially decaying function (determined from the attenuation) to give a more complete equation for radiation. The <b>buildup</b> <b>factor</b> is greater than or equal to one. It can never be less than one, as this would imply that the buildup is decreasing the dosage. If the <b>buildup</b> <b>factor</b> is equal to one. Then this shows that there is no buildup of radiation in the material. The goal of my research is to measure the attenuation coefficient (penetrating power) and the <b>buildup</b> <b>factor</b> of the alloy, MCP 200. Then, comparisons will be made to theoretical and computational research conducted on different materials from other papers. It was found that the <b>buildup</b> <b>factor</b> increased linearly with increasing material thickness, decreased with increasing photon energy, and increased with increasing attenuator to detector distance. It was reported in a paper that the <b>buildup</b> <b>factor</b> increased with increasing photon energy. Other papers reported that the <b>buildup</b> <b>factor</b> would first increase with increasing photon energy, reach a peak, and then begin decreasing.

40|$|The linear {{attenuation}} coefficient and <b>buildup</b> <b>factor</b> {{are a few of}} the important characteristics that need to be studied and determined prior to using a material clinically in radiation treatment and protection. The {{linear attenuation}} coefficient and <b>buildup</b> <b>factor,</b> as well as several other properties, will be determined for MCP- 96 alloy to assess its use in radiation therapy. A narrow collimated beam of γ-rays from sources with varying energies will pass through various thicknesses of MCP- 96 alloy. The attenuation in the intensity of the beam will be determined for each varying thickness of the alloy. Plotting the thickness of the alloy versus the corresponding logarithmic intensity of the beam will allow calculation of the {{linear attenuation coefficient}}. The narrow beam geometry will then be replaced by the broad beam geometry to determine the <b>buildup</b> <b>factor.</b> Additional radiation is obtained through the broad beam geometry as a result of scattering and secondary radiation. Comparing the broad beam geometry to the narrow beam geometry allows determination of the <b>buildup</b> <b>factor.</b> Since the <b>buildup</b> <b>factor</b> depends upon the thickness of the MCP- 96 attenuator, the energy of the beam, and the source-to-attenuator (STA) distance, it will be calculated using three parameters.

40|$|Computer {{modeling}} of nondestructive inspections with x-rays {{is proving to}} be a very useful tool for enhancing the performance of these techniques. Two x-ray based inspection techniques are considered in this study. The first is 2 ̆ 2 Radiographic Inspection 2 ̆ 2, where an existing simulation model has been improved to account for scattered radiation effects. The second technique is 2 ̆ 2 Inspection with Compton backscattering 2 ̆ 2, where a new simulation model has been developed;The effect of scattered radiation on a simulated radiographic image can be insignificant, equally important, or more important than the effect of the uncollided flux. Techniques to account for the scattered radiation effects include Monte Carlo techniques, and solving the particle transport equation for photons. However, these two techniques although accurate, are computationally expensive and hence inappropriate for use in computer simulation of radiography. A less accurate approach but computationally efficient is the principle of <b>buildup</b> <b>factors.</b> Traditionally, <b>buildup</b> <b>factors</b> are defined for monoenergetic photons of energies typical of a nuclear reactor. In this work I have expanded the definition of <b>buildup</b> <b>factors</b> to include a bremsstrahlung spectrum of photons with energies typically used in radiography (keV 2 ̆ 7 s instead of MeV 2 ̆ 7 s). This expansion of the definition relies on an intensive experimental work to measure <b>buildup</b> <b>factors</b> for a white spectrum of x-rays. I have also developed a monte carlo code to reproduce the measured <b>buildup</b> <b>factors.</b> The code was then converted to a parallel code and distributed on a network of workstations to reduce the execution time;The second inspection technique is based on Compton backscattering, where photons are scattered at large angles, more than 90 degrees. The importance of this technique arises when the inspected object is very large, or when access is limited to only one side of the specimen. The downside of detecting photons from backscattering is the low cross section for Compton scattering at such angles. However, several parameters can be optimized to enhance the probability of a backscattering event. These include the x-ray tube settings, the orientation of the inspected object and the angles of the incident and backscattered radiation. Optimizing these parameters can be made fast, inexpensive and more convenient by using a simulation code...|$|R

The steady release in an open field of Argon- 41 and Xenon- 133 for 4 different release heights is studied, thus covering radionuclides that decay with a high-energy gamma and a low-energy gamma, respectively. Based on these simulations, the variability of dose rates at ground level for different averaging times in the dose measurements is analyzed. It is observed that turbulent variability in the wind field can lead to dose estimates that are underestimated by up to a factor of four when conventional long-term measurements are used to estimate the dose from short-term exposures. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{radioactivity}} of some structural building materials, rows, binders, {{and final}} construction products, originating from Serbia or imported from other countries, {{was investigated in}} the current study by using the standard HPGe gamma spectrometry. The absorbed dose in the air was computed by the method of <b>buildup</b> <b>factors</b> for models of the room with the walls of concrete, gas-concrete, brick and stone. Using the conversion coefficients obtained by interpolation of the International Commission on Radiobiological Protection (ICRP) equivalent doses for isotropic irradiation, the corresponding average indoor effective dose from the radiation of building materials of 0. 24 mSv·y− 1 was determined. The outdoor dose of 0. 047 mSv·y− 1 was estimated on the basis of values of the specific absorbed dose rates calculated for the radiation of the series of 238 U, 232 Th and 40 K from the ground and covering materials. The literature values of the effective dose conversion coefficients for ground geometry were applied as well as the published data for content of the radionuclides in the soil...|$|R
